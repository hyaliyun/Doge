It was begun in 1555, but was never completed. The building and park are open to the public. History The ch√¢teau was begun in around 1555 for Jean Girard, panetier, or breadmaster, to King Henri II. It was planned as a symmetrical building, flanked by tall wings. However, in 1563, Girard was assassinated, and the building site was abandoned. The master masons, who had been imported from Paris by Girard, dispersed across the local area, influencing the designs of several buildings in the area. Further building was not carried out until the 18th century, when Sylvestre, Count of Chaffault, attempted to complete it. Ionic pilasters were added to the principal windows, surmounted by a pediment inscribed with the Count's armorial bearings and the date 1773. Gardens were laid out, and the large pond excavated. However, the Count, a royalist, was forced to flee the country following the arrest of Louis XVI during the French Revolution. During his absence, a republican mob plundered the ch√¢teau, defacing the armorial bearings, and killing the Count's children. By the early 19th century the ch√¢teau was owned by the Marquis de Saint Denis, a keen agricultural improver. He transformed the gardens, and planted numerous exotic trees, including Magnolia, Swamp Cypress, Zelkova and California Redwood. His successor Henri Luce de Tremont also hoped to complete the ch√¢teau, but instead he chose to move the curved perron stair from the proposed central bay of the garden facade, to the actual central bay. From 1920, the statesman Georges Clemenceau rented a house, known as la bicoque, (\\"the shack\\") on the estate. He became friends with the owner, Amed√©e Luce de Tremont, and was regularly entertained in the dining room of the ch√¢teau. La bicoque is now a state property, and is open to the public as the Maison de Georges Clemenceau. The ch√¢teau remains privately owned, and is now open to the public. It has been classed as a monument historique since 1978. Architecture The ch√¢teau is an example of French Renaissance architecture. It comprises a three-bay section of three storeys, the proposed central block, and a tall wing of four storeys. The steeply-sloping slate roofs are supported on the original oak timbers, felled on the estate and dated by dendrochronology to 1556. The roofs are topped by very tall red-brick chimneys. Each window has a mullion and two transoms, made of granite, as are other decorative features. The interiors include large granite fireplaces, probably modelled on published designs by the Italian architect Sebastiano Serlio. Parc des Aventuriers The gardens of the ch√¢teau have been developed as the Parc des Aventuriers, a children's adventure trail and treasure hunt, based on the history of world exploration. Within the park are a number of prehistoric menhirs, as well as more recent garden features.

Life =Early life= Isaac was the sixth son of Robert Bargrave, of Bridge, Kent, and was educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. and M.A. On 9 July 1611 he was incorporated M.A. of Oxford, and in the October following became rector of Eythorne. In 1612 he held the office of 'taxor' at Cambridge, and he acted in the Latin comedy Ignoramus performed at the university before James I on 8 March 1615 and written by George Ruggle of his college. =Chaplaincies= Shortly afterwards Bargrave went to Venice as chaplain to Sir Henry Wotton, the English ambassador there, and befriended Paolo Sarpi. In 1618 he returned to England with a letter of introduction from Wotton to the king. In 1622 he received the degree of D.D. at Cambridge, and was appointed a prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral. It was about the same time that he was granted the living of St. Margaret's, Westminster, and became chaplain to Prince Charles, an office which he retained after the prince ascended the throne in 1625. =Dean= On the death of John Boys of Canterbury, who had married Bargrave's sister, Bargrave succeeded to the deanery, to which he was formally admitted on 16 October 1625. He obtained the vicarage of Tenterden in 1626, and was presented to the benefice of Lydd by the king in September 1627, but only held it for a few weeks. On 5 June 1628 he received the vicarage of Chartham, which he continued to hold till his death. =Controversies= In the last years of James I's reign Bargrave had preached a sermon which threw him into disfavour with the court; but as dean of Canterbury he supported the policy of Charles I. A sermon preached by him before Charles I on 27 March 1627 supported the collection of that year's arbitrary loan. In later years Bargrave did not live on good terms with his diocesan William Laud, or with the cathedral clergy. In 1634-5 he insisted on the Walloon congregation at Canterbury and the Belgian church of Sandwich conforming to the ritual of the church of England; but the archbishop did not approve of these orders. Bargrave claimed precedence over the deans of London and Westminster, and engaged in a dispute with William Somner, the registrar of the diocese. Soon after the opening of the Long Parliament Bargrave became an object of attack. When the bill for the abolition of deans and chapters was introduced by Sir Edward Dering, the first cousin of his wife, he was fined ¬£1,000 as a prominent member of convocation. On 12 May 1641 he went to the House of Commons to present petitions from the university of Cambridge and from the officers of Canterbury Cathedral against the bill. Although the bill was ultimately dropped, Bargrave's unpopularity increased. =Imprisonment & death= At the beginning of the First English Civil War, in August 1642, Edwin Sandys, a parliamentary colonel who had been on good terms with Bargrave, occupied the deanery. Bargrave was absent, but his wife and children were roughly treated; and Sandys arrested Bargrave at Gravesend, after which he spent time in the Fleet Prison After three weeks' imprisonment Bargrave was released without having been brought to trial. He returned to Canterbury and died there early in January 1643. He was buried in the dean's chapel of the cathedral. In 1679 a memorial was erected above the grave by the dean's nephew, John Bargrave, with a portrait painted on copper of the dean, attributed to Cornelius Jansen. =Family= Bargrave was married to Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir John Dering, of Pluckley, and first cousin of Sir Edward Dering. Of Bargrave's children one son, Thomas, married a niece of Sir Henry Wotton, and was an executor of Sir Henry's will. Works Bargrave published three sermons: one preached from Psalms xxvi. 6 before the House of Commons 28 Feb. 1623-4; another preached from Hosea x. 1 at Whitehall in 1624, and a third preached from 1 Sam. xv. 23 before King Charles 29 March 1627.

It is part of the Rogue River watershed, draining approximately of Jackson County. Rising in the Siskiyou Mountains, the river flows generally northwest to meet the Applegate about northwest of Buncom and south of Ruch. The Little Applegate River's watershed was originally settled about 11,000 years ago by the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede Native American tribes. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the early 19th century. Two boomtowns‚ÄîSterlingville and Buncom‚Äîwere founded in the 1850s and grew rapidly as gold and other precious metals were discovered. They slowly declined in population as the supply of gold was exhausted; only three buildings remain in Buncom, while Sterlingville was abandoned and later destroyed. Despite low water quality, the Little Applegate watershed supports populations of coho and Chinook salmon, along with 138 known and 134 suspected species of other vertebrates. Sixty-four percent of the watershed is forested, although its health is slowly declining due to fire suppression. Course Glade Creek, a tributary of the Little Applegate River The Little Applegate River arises at several springs near Siskiyou Peak, in the Siskiyou Mountains. It flows north, receiving McDonald Creek on the right, and Glade Creek on the left. Water was diverted into Sterling Ditch near the Little Applegate's confluence with Glade Creek. Sterling Ditch is an approximately aqueduct, built in 1877 to provide water for hydraulic mining in the now destroyed town of Sterlingville. About one mile downstream of the location where stream flow was diverted from the Little Applegate River into Sterling Ditch, the river turns northwest. Five miles downstream of the diversion is the confluence with another major tributary, Yale Creek, on the left. Yale Creek drains nearly , making it the largest of the Little Applegate's tributaries by watershed area. From Yale Creek, the Little Applegate flows northwest, receiving water from Sterling Creek on the right. The town of Buncom is located at the mouth of Sterling Creek. The stream empties into the Applegate River about northwest of Buncom and south of Ruch, above the Applegate's confluence with the Rogue River. For fish swimming upstream, the Little Applegate is the last major tributary of the Applegate before the unpassable Applegate Dam. The Little Applegate River's average discharge is , but can range anywhere from depending on the season and the amount of precipitation. Watershed The Little Applegate drains approximately of southern Oregon. It makes up just under 15 percent of the Applegate River's watershed, and just over 2 percent of the Rogue River basin. The Bureau of Land Management controls 40 percent of the watershed, and another 32 percent is owned by the United States Forest Service. Twenty-seven percent is privately owned, and the state of Oregon controls less than one percent. Approximately 96 percent of the land is either forested or woodlots, while farmland and rural areas make up the remaining 4 percent. The Little Applegate watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate; the average annual precipitation in the watershed is , however as much as and as little as have been recorded. Precipitation in the area consists of mostly rain, and occasionally snow in the higher elevations. The primary rock types in the watershed are early Mesozoic metamorphosed sediments and volcanics, ultramafic deposits, and granitoid intrusions, like much of the Siskiyou Mountains. Elevations range from at the river's mouth to at Dutchman Peak. Streams above about have lower gradients because those areas were heavily eroded by glaciers; they then drop quickly until they reach the Little Applegate Valley at about , which is fairly flat due to a high amount of alluvial deposits. Flora and fauna The watershed is covered predominantly by temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 64 percent of the total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's fritillary, oblongleaf stonecrop, Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, Scotch broom, St. Johns wort, and tansy ragwort. Prior to the 1940s, wildfires burned through the Little Applegate River watershed frequently. The United States Forest Service began fire suppression efforts in the 1920s, and a smokejumper station was built about 20 years later. Species that depend on fire to reproduce‚Äîsuch as ponderosa pine‚Äîdeclined in population, while Douglas-fir and white fir spread. Buckbrush and manzanita, normally chaparral plants, encroached on the oak savanna regions. The vegetation in the watershed continues to grow denser, making it more susceptible to insect infestations and disease. The northern spotted owl One hundred thirty-eight species of vertebrates are known to live in the Little Applegate's watershed, while another 134 are suspected. Some of the watershed have been designated as Critical Habitat Units for the northern spotted owl, a critically endangered species. Two other species known to live in the watershed are included in the IUCN Red List: the endangered Siskiyou Mountains salamander, and the vulnerable western pond turtle. Bighorn sheep, gray wolves, grizzly bears, and pronghorns once inhabited the region, but are now considered extirpated. The most common fish inhabiting the river include Chinook salmon, threatened coho salmon, and rainbow trout. Fish populations are declining, however, due to low water quality and barriers such as dams and culverts. History Humans have lived in the Little Applegate River watershed for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed. The first European Americans to visit the area were a group of fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. The community of Buncom was founded by Chinese miners in 1851 when gold, silver, cinnabar, and chromite were discovered in nearby Jacksonville. In the spring of 1854, James Sterling and Aaron Davis discovered gold in the Sterling Creek area, and hundreds of miners soon arrived. The town of Sterlingville was founded, and by October its population had risen to over 1,500. Mining lasted through the 1850s and 1860s, and much of the riverbeds of Sterling Creek and the lower Little Applegate River were excavated. The Sterling Ditch and several other ditches were constructed in the 1870s, providing water to large hydraulic mining operations in Sterlingville and surrounding regions. The Sterlingville mine quickly became the largest hydraulic mine in Oregon, and possibly the entire western United States. The mining washed hundreds of thousands of tons of earth and sediment into the Little Applegate and its tributaries, devastating the landscape. The Sterlingville post office opened in 1879, but was closed four years later as the town's population declined. Buncom's post office opened in 1896. By 1910, however, most mining operations had ended, and it was closed in 1918. Hydraulic mines were reopened from 1933 to 1957 during the Great Depression. Three buildings remain in Buncom, but Sterlingville was abandoned and destroyed. In the late 1990s, 41 irrigators in the lower watershed agreed to transfer their water rights to the nearby Applegate River (supplemented by Applegate Lake), allowing for the removal of two large fish barriers on the Little Applegate River. The first, the Buck and Jones irrigation dam near Buncom, was removed in 2006. The second, the Farmers Ditch irrigation dam, was removed in 2012. Altogether, the removal of the two dams returned of water back to the Little Applegate River and opened up of streams to migrating fish. Pollution The water quality of the Little Applegate River watershed is generally poor due to high temperatures, sedimentation, and oxygen saturation levels which occur throughout the region. Most of these problems are created by human activity; forests and riparian zones have been cleared to make way for agriculture, and high road densities cause slope failures. Hydraulic mining near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape, leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream. Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed, reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread. Overgrazing also contributes to soil erosion. Large amounts of water is diverted from the river and its tributaries, sometimes to such an extent that the mouth is left nearly dry. A major contributor to the sedimentation of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an irrigation ditch near McDonald Creek.

N√∏rager grew up in the Danish town Virum with his mother, a free lance creative director and graphics designer for the advertising industry, and his father CASPER, a record producer for Polydor Records. At a young age he became friends with Jurij Moskvitin. During his early years N√∏rager quickly grew a fondness for the graffiti drawing style and participated in the graffiti subculture of Copenhagen during the 80's. The original 80's subcultural style is still present in most of N√∏rager's works. After graduating from the Danish Advertisingschool, N√∏rager continued onto The Short & Documentary Filmschool where he graduated in 2005 with the short film De Personlige. Fashion shows  After a couple of years working in advertising N√∏rager became friends with the Welsh fashion designer Andrew Mackenzie. Together with a professional camera crew N√∏rager directed Mackenzie's Fashion Shows in Milan from 2005 to 2007. The use of an entirely professional camera team using multiple stable camera angles and focusing on the detail in the design, instead of watching the audience and high tempo zoom and tilt, together with a professional film editor resulted in a completely new paradigm for fashion photography.  De Personlige  N√∏rager directed his first picture De Personlige (The Personals) in 2005. It featured a story about a lonely business man who through a personal ad gets a blind date with what he thinks is a beautiful young woman and her child. During the dinner in the lady's apartment she refers to the picture she sent the man as \\"a bit dated\\" further more it turns out her now 30-year-old son also lives in the apartment. The business man regrets his involvement and tries to sneak away, with disastrous consequences.  Bible Black: Five Days with Andrew Mackenzie (2011) Movie poster for the movie Bible Black After his involvement with filming the fashion shows, N√∏rager decided to make a very personal documentary about his friend Andrew Mackenzie, Bible Black (2011) . The documentary features Mackenzie's great comeback to the fashion world after a couple years of obscurity due to legal trouble over the trademark name \\"Andrew Mackenzie\\". The documentary follows the increasingly anxious Mackenzie in the last days before a fashion show giving a unique view into the fashion world. As opposed to N√∏rager's fashion shootings featuring a complete film crew, N√∏rager chose to be the cameraman himself, in that way ensuring that he did not disturb Mackenzie in his work, and also making sure he could track Mackenzie's every move. The production of the movie happened without any public economic support and was screened as a working copy at the Copenhagen International Documentary Festival . where it received a standing applause from the audience and positive reviews by numerous newspapers, Politiken going so far as calling it \\"A true view into the fashion industry\\". While the Internet magazine look4fashion.dk praised the camera work and called the movie an expirance for fashion lovers and movie lovers alike After nearly 2.5 years where the movie was shelved in legal battle, the movie was premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2011.

Lydiard's origins are obscure, but he joined the navy in 1780 and rose through the ranks after distinguished service in the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars, particularly during the Siege of Toulon. He saw action in several engagements in the Mediterranean, and had a part in the defeat of a French frigate in 1795. The chance for promotion passed him by however when the French ship escaped. He again demonstrated his qualities on a cutting-out expedition under the guns of a French shore battery, and this time was successful in escaping with his prize. He was promoted and appointed to the command of his prize, and went on to be captain of several small vessels before a period of unemployment caused by his promotion to post-captain. He returned to active service in 1805 with command of the razee , in which ship he distinguished himself in a number of incidents in the West Indies, capturing a Spanish frigate, attacking a French ship of the line, and helping to capture the island of Cura√ßao. He returned to Britain after these exploits, but his ship was caught in a gale, and despite his best efforts, was driven ashore and wrecked. Lydiard did his utmost to save as many of his men as he could, before being swept away and drowned. Early life Lydiard's origins are largely unknown, but his entry to the navy is recorded as being on 13 May 1780, when he joined the 100-gun as a captain's servant. The Britannia was at this time the flagship of Vice-Admiral George Darby, commander of the Channel Fleet. Lydiard was appointed an able seaman on 25 July 1781, and on 27 May 1782 was transferred to the 44-gun , at first as an able seaman, but receiving a promotion to midshipman on 12 October that year. He went on to serve aboard the 74-gun and , and passed his lieutenant's examination on 27 May 1791. He was serving with Lord Hood's fleet during the occupation of Toulon in the early months of the French Revolutionary Wars. Lydiard distinguished himself with his actions during the hard-fought defence of Fort Mulgrave, and received his commission on 25 November 1793. Lieutenancy He then became first lieutenant of , one of the prizes from Toulon, under the command of Commander William Shield. Shield and Lydiard served along the French Mediterranean coast until October 1794, and were engaged in cutting-out enemy ships from French harbours. Sincere was then paid off and Lydiard transferred to the 74-gun , where he saw action at the Battle of Genoa on 14 March and the Battle of Hy√®res Islands on 13 July 1795. His former commander, William Shield, had received command of the 32-gun by July 1795, and Lydiard transferred that month to serve as his first lieutenant. Lydiard remained with Southampton after Shield's replacement by Captain James Macnamara and in September 1795 they spent 15 days blockading a French grain convoy in the port of Genoa. =Southampton and the French= The convoy was protected by two frigates, the Vestale and the Brun. The French finally came out on the evening of the fifteenth day, and were engaged by Southampton, despite the French possessing considerably more firepower. After a sustained engagement Southampton forced Vestale to strike her colours while the Brun escaped with the convoy, leaving Vestale to her fate. But as Southampton prepared to lower her boats to take possession of the French ship, her fore-mast, which had been damaged during the engagement, went by the board. Taking advantage of this, Vestale raised her colours and escaped from the scene. Victory over the Vestale should have brought promotions for Southamptons officers, including Lydiard, but her escape deprived them of this. Lydiard now had to secure another triumph to ensure his promotion. =Capture of Utile= Lydiard's next opportunity to distinguish himself came in June 1796. On 9 June a French corvette was sighted entering Hy√®res bay, and Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, summoned Macnamara to his flagship, . He asked Macnamara to bring out the French ship if he could. Recognising the difficulty and risk that would be involved, he did not make it a formal written order, instead instructing Macnamara 'bring out the enemy's ship if you can; I'll give you no written order; but I direct you to take care of the king's ship under your command.' Macnamara promptly took his ship in under the guns of the batteries, and apparently having been mistaken for a French or neutral frigate, closed to within pistol shot of the French ship, and demanded her captain surrender. The captain replied with a broadside, and Macnamara brought Southampton alongside and sent Lydiard over in command of the boarders. After subduing fierce resistance Lydiard took possession of the French ship and together he and Macnamara escaped out to sea under heavy fire from the French shore batteries. Macnamara wrote in a letter to Jervis The prize, a 24-gun corvette named Utile, was taken into service with the Royal Navy as HMS Utile and Lydiard was promoted and given command of her, a commission confirmed on 22 July 1796. Command Lydiard spent some time in the Adriatic before returning to Britain in 1797 as a convoy escort, after which Utile was paid off. He was appointed to command the bomb vessel in May 1798, followed by the sloop in November that year. He served aboard Kite in the North Sea until his promotion to post-captain on 1 January 1801, at which point he was superseded in the command of the Kite. No further commands could be found for him, and the Peace of Amiens further lengthened his enforced retirement from active service. He went ashore during this time, and took the opportunity to marry. The couple had three sons together. Pomona off Havana, depicted by Thomas Whitcombe Lydiard finally returned to active service in December 1805, with an appointment to command the 38-gun . Anson had originally been a 64-gun third rate, but had been razeed in 1794. He sailed Anson to the West Indies in early 1806 and in August was sailing in company with Captain Charles Brisbane's when on 23 August they came across the 38-gun Spanish frigate Pomona off Havana, guarded by a shore battery and twelve gunboats. The Pomona was trying to enter the harbour, whereupon Lydiard and Brisbane bore up and engaged her. The gunboats came out to defend her, whereupon the two British frigates anchored between the shore battery and gunboats on one side, and the Pomona on the other. A hard fought action began, which lasted for 35 minutes until the Pomona struck her colours. Three of the gunboats were blown up, six were sunk, and the remaining three were badly damaged. The shore battery was obliged to stop firing after an explosion in one part of it. There were no casualties aboard Anson, but Arethusa lost two killed and 32 wounded, with Brisbane among the latter. The captured Pomona was subsequently taken into the Navy as . =Anson and Foudroyant= Lydiard remained cruising off Havana, and on 15 September sighted the French 84-gun Foudroyant. The Foudroyant, carrying the flag of Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, had been dismasted in a storm and was carrying a jury-rig. Despite the superiority of his opponent and the nearness of the shore Lydiard attempted to close on the French vessel and opened fire. Anson came under fire from the fortifications at Morro Castle, while several Spanish ships, including the 74-gun San Lorenzo, came out of Havana to assist the French. After being unable to manoeuvre into a favourable position and coming under heavy fire, Lydiard hauled away and made his escape. Anson had two killed and 13 wounded during the engagement, while the rigging was badly cut. Foudroyant meanwhile had 27 killed or wounded. =Capture of Cura√ßao= The capture of Cura√ßao, depicted by Thomas Whitcombe Anson was then assigned to Charles Brisbane's squadron and joined Brisbane's Arethusa and James Athol Wood's . The ships were despatched in November 1806 by Vice- Admiral James Richard Dacres to reconnoitre Cura√ßao. They were joined in December by and Brisbane decided to launch an attack on 1 January 1807. The British ships approached early in the morning of 1 January and anchored in the harbour. They were attacked by the Dutch, at which Brisbane boarded and captured the 36-gun frigate Halstaar, while Lydiard attacked and secured the 20-gun corvette Suriname. Both Lydiard and Brisbane then led their forces on shore, and stormed Fort Amsterdam, which was defended by 270 Dutch troops. The fort was carried after ten minutes of fighting, after which two smaller forts, a citadel and the entire town were also taken. More troops were landed while the ships sailed round the harbour to attack Fort R√©publique. By 10 am the fort had surrendered, and by noon the entire island had capitulated. Lydiard was sent back to Britain carrying the despatches and captured colours. The dramatic success of the small British force carrying the heavily defended island was rewarded handsomely. Brisbane was knighted, and the captains received swords, medals and vases. Wreck of Anson 'Loss of the Anson Frigate, off Cornwall', in an 1808 depiction by William Elmes Anson was sent back to Britain shortly afterwards, and Lydiard rejoined his ship at Plymouth. After a period refitting Anson was assigned to the Channel Fleet and ordered to support the blockade of Brest by patrolling off Black Rocks. She sailed from Falmouth on 24 December, and reached Ile de Bas on 28 December. With a gale blowing up from the south west, Lydiard decided to return to port. He made for the Lizard, but in the poor weather, came up on the wrong side and became trapped on a lee shore, with breakers ahead. Anson rolled heavily in rough seas, having retained the spars from her days as a 64-gun ship after she had been razeed. Lydiard's only option was to anchor, but early on the morning of 29 December the rising storm caused the anchor cables to part and she was driven onto the shore. Lydiard ordered the ship to be run onto a beach in the hope of saving as many lives as possible, and resolved to remain aboard to oversee the evacuation. The pounding surf prevented boats from being launched from the ship or the shore, and a number of the crew were swept away. Some managed to clamber along the fallen main-mast to the shore, while Lydiard clung to the wheel to encourage them on. Eyewitnesses recorded that Lydiard had exhausted himself with the effort of organising the evacuation and clinging to the wreck in the violence of the storm. He attempted to leave the ship, but became distracted by trying to help a boy. In doing so Lydiard was washed away and drowned. The Naval Chronicles account of the wreck recorded that A total of sixty of Ansons crew were lost, including her captain and her first-lieutenant. Lydiard's body was recovered and a funeral service was held at Falmouth, attended by Admiral Sir Charles Cotton and large numbers of army and navy officers, as well as the local dignitaries. The body was later interred in the family vault at Haslemere, Surrey. In fiction Lydiard is briefly mentioned in the 1946 novel Lord Hornblower by C. S. Forester. The opening scene is a church service for members of the Order of the Bath, at which a number of prominent naval officers are present. This includes Lydiard, Samuel Hood, James Lucas Yeo and the fictional Horatio Hornblower. However the novel is set in 1813, six years after Lydiard's death.

The primary infection is intestinal and transferred by the faecal-oral route. Spores of C. novyi escape from the gut and lodge in the liver, where they remain dormant until some injury creates anaerobic conditions for them to germinate, causing local necrosis and widespread damage to the microvascular system, resulting in subcutaneous bleeding and blackening of the skin, hence the common name \\"black disease\\".Merck Veterinary Manual  In sheep  In sheep, the disease, referred to as \\"black disease\\", results from interaction of bacteria (especially C. novyi) and liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica).Jensen, Rue & Brinton L. (1982). Diseases of Sheep. Philadelphia, Lea & Febiger. . p. 210-213. = Symptoms = As with other enterotoxemias, the disease leads to sudden death. Nevertheless, sheep with previous vaccination can show a protracted course. The rest of the flock may show loss of appetite and pica.Mahin, Lucien, veterinary practitionner, personal communication. = Post-mortem lesions = Peritoneal and thoracic cavities contains a great quantity of fluids, as does the pericardial sac. The liver is sometimes swollen with perihepatitis. There appear a great number of necrotic foci, 3 to 4 mm diameter, which extend deeply in the organ. Hepatic lymph nodes are enlarged. The gallbladder is full. Subcutaneous tissues are full of cyanotic venous blood. They may darken the hide, hence the name \\"black disease\\".Jensen & Brinton, op cit. = Control = In order to control for the disease, the Lymnaea spp snails, which are the intermediate host for the liver flukes, need to be controlled. There are three ways that have proven most effective when controlling the snail populations: * The first is by treating pastures and water channels with copper sulfate. This method is not always practical, because it is too expensive to treat in large areas. Lack of cooperation between neighbors is also a problem, snails are easily transported, and treated pastures become re-infested by neighboring fields and streams. * Drenching the sheep with carbon tetra-chloride in paraffin oil has proven to be an alternative. However, drenching in more than recommended doses can be fatal, by causing liver damage, which could initiate the disease in sheep carrying B. oedematiens spores. * Drainage is an effective option to eliminate the snails. However, draining the places where the grass grows eliminates a source of food for the sheep and creates other unwanted problems.

Ayegunle Gbede is located at the North-Eastern part of Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State. Ijumu Local Government Area is on coordinates 70 51‚ÄôN, 50 58‚ÄôE. Ayegunle Gbede is the second largest and most populous town in Gbede land. The town is a nodal town in which five roads from different villages and towns intersected at the heart of the town. Ayegunle Gbede shares common borders with Oleh Bunu, Ayeh Gbede, Ayetoro Gbede, Iyah Gbede, Idoyi Bunu, Iluhafon Gbede, and Ayedayo Amuro. It is a settlement essentially on ridges of mountains. Thus, it is a much cooler town to live than all the neighboring villages and towns. The neighboring villages and towns are Ayetoro Gbede, Iyah Gbede, Iluhafon Gbede, Agringbon-Oke Gbede, Okoro Gbede, Ayeh Gbede, Odokoro Gbede, Araromi Gbede and Iluagba Gbede. Ayegunle Gbede is a town in Ijumu local government in Kogi State in the Middle belt of Nigeria. It lies after Ayetoro gbede and Iyah Gbede, at the intersection of the stretch of road from Lokoja, Kabba, Ayetoro gbede, Mopa, Egbe, and Ilorin. The Federal capital city, Abuja is about a 4-hour drive away. Ayegunle Market(Ohon) is a trade centre for diverse cash crops and staples including coffee, cocoa, yams, cassava, corn (maize), sorghum, shea nuts, peanuts (groundnuts), beans, cotton, and woven cloth produced by the Yoruba, Igbira, Igala, and other peoples of the surrounding area. The natives of Ayegunle Gbedde town, speak a dialect called 'Gbedde' or 'Okun', which is a sub group of the Yoruba. Many easily speak and understand the Yoruba, as the Okun language shares vowels and enunciations with it. Ayegunle Gbede is the second largest community in Gbede land after Ayetoro Gbede. The community shares common boundaries with Iyah Gbede in Ijumu Local Government Area, Olle Bunu in Kabba Bunu Local Government Area, Ayeh Gbede in Ijumu Local Government Area, Ayeteju Amuro in Mopa Amuro Local Government Area and Iluafon in Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State. Ayegunle Gbede community settlement in her present location started on 1st August, 1927. On this date, the then nine (9) communities known as ‚ÄúAku Mehan‚Äù in Gbede, who were hitherto living scattered on separate lands agrees to come together since there was need for total protection from the intruders who often invade their land at a meeting point under an ‚ÄúOhon‚Äù fruit tree believed to be central to all for convenience. On this fateful day, the portion of land surrounding the Ohon tree was cleared and was agreed to be used as a market to be named Ohi-ona market (foreshortened as Ohona market) where all shall meets every five days. The name Ohi-Ona (Ohona) was chosen because the land cleared belongs to Ohi and Ona in parts. Thereafter, residential plots were assigned for clearing and issuance of economic trees such as palm trees, iroko and awo trees i.e. mahogany were also resolved by the Forestry Officers, Mr. Jacob Ojo, Late Rev. James Osadare Olorunyomi, and Olu Maiyaki Ibimodi of Igah Quarters. On the 16th August, 1927, Late Olorunyomi went along with Mr. Ojo to Olu Ibimodi at Igah village on the subject of the forest clearing that was required at Ohon Market. The following day, 17th August, 1927, the afore-mentioned villages began to clear the site of their new settlement around the Ohon Market Square in present Ayegunle Gbede. On the 6th September, 1927, at a meeting conveyed by Late Olorunyomi that was held at Olu Ibimodi of Igah residence attended by all the Chiefs (Ijoye) of the nine villages, the Christians heads and the Muslims leaders, where an irrevocable decision to continue with the clearing work at the resettlement site was taken. Igah people who hosted this meeting and fed the people present with pounded yam contained in twenty giant calabashes. On December 2nd, 1927, the District Officer, Mr. P.G Harris and his entourage in the presence of Chief (Oba) Elewa of Odda and a multitude of people who came to Ohi-Ona measured and shared plots of land to all the uniting communities. January 31st, 1928, was historic day when Muslim Ummah (Faithful) made the first public call to Salat (prayer) and thereafter, observed first Salat at the Ohon Market, new settlement. On 31st January, 1928, the name ‚ÄúAyegunle Gbede‚Äô‚Äô was adopted as the name of the combined community. Late Chief Osu Momodu Emetan of Akure made the proclamation. However, the market name Ohona persisted for years. This name derived from ‚ÄòOhi-Ona‚Äô which was the name for a group of villages. The villages are: Akure, Agbara, Okeleti, Iluesho, Agoh, Esseh, Eguru, Igah, and Ofede. To date, the unity and sense of purpose persisted to the glory of Ayegunle Gbede. On the 16th February, 1928, Bojuwon from Igah started his own house at the new settlement, closely followed by Olojo and Moraiyewa, the trio from Igah as cited in ‚ÄúThe Baptist New Light‚ÄìPastoral and Community Development Work of Late Rev. James Osadare Olorunyomi by Pastor Seth Esan Olorunyomi‚Äù. According to oral record, Okeleti Quarters was the first quarter to move in group to the present Ayegunle Gbede due to the wildfire disaster on their building at the old Okeleti. PEOPLE Ayegunle Gbede people are well educated, generous, knowledgeable, principled, courageous, intelligent, kind, peace-loving, religious, and accommodative. According to Professor Umaru A. Pate, a Professor of Media and Society from the Faculty of Communication, Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria in September 29, 2017, ‚ÄúWithout doubt, reading through the text, one cannot but commend Ayegunle Gbede community for significantly contributing to the process of development in the country. Certainly, in writing the history of Nigeria, the name of Ayegunle Gbede and its people are likely to appear in gold. It is a community strategically located in the Centre of Nigeria, thus connecting the north and the west and the south. Not so many communities enjoy such geographical advantage or can boast of an array of stars in academics like Ayegunle Gbede. A few among them are: Professor Suleiman Moh‚Äôd Nasirudeen, Botany Professor of Federal University, Lokoja, Professor Joash Amupitan (SAN), Law Professor of University of Jos, Professor Sulaiman Ola Idris, Chemistry Professor of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Professor Kashim Isah Bolaji, Industrial Design Professor of Federal University of Technology, Akure, Professor (Dr.) Momoh-Jimoh Salami Eyiomika, Mechatronics Engineering Professor of International Islamic University, Malaysia, Professor John Adesiji Olorunmaiye, Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Vice Chancellor of Crown-Hill University, Eyenkorin, Ilorin, Professor Abdullateef Olorunfemi Onundi, Professor of Structural Engineering of University of Maiduguri, Professor (Sir) Mujtaba Abdullah Muhammad, Professor of Business Administration and Vice Chancellor of Afriford University, Cotonou, Republic of Benin and many others‚Äù. Others prominent Ayegunle Gbede sons and Daughters of note are Dr. Habeeb Abdullah Yaqeen, Chief David Shola Aiyedogbon, Architect Salman Idris, Chief Femi Ajisafe, Miliki Abdul Idris, Oladele John Nihi, Engr. Adam Amupitan Onundi, Dapo Olorunyomi (The Publisher of Premium Times), Alhaji Sumaila Olaniyi Aminu, Elder Elijah Edubi, Alhaji Ismaila Jebe Elega, Pastor Seth Esan Olorunyomi, Alhaji Musa Olorunkemi (The Imam of Ayegunle Gbede), Hon. Stephen Bamidele Abodunde (Former Member of the Federal House of Representatives, Lagos), Alhaji Hudu Abdulsalam, Mrs. Bernice Bamitale Adebo-Oladele (Dallas Texas, United State of America), Alhaji Ahmad Jebe, Babayemi Olorunfemi (Canada), Fatai Ade-Ahmed, Dr. Yisau Adekunle Abdulkadir, Engr. Nafiu Sadiq, Dr. Haliru Alhaji Umar, Alhaji Abdulkareem Onundi, Dr. Nasir Naeem Abdulsalam, Yusuf Adeyanju Yisau, and so on. OCCUPATION Farming is a predominant occupation in Ayegunle Gbede. The community is blessed with massive arable land for agricultural cultivation of both food and cash crops. Prominent among the agricultural products are cash crops like coffee, oil palm, cashew, kolanut, cocoa, rubber etc; food crops like yam, cassava, cocoyam, sweet potatoes etc; legume crops such as groundnut, melon etc; citrus crops such as orange, pineapple, plantain, banana, mango, peas, beans etc, and cereal crops such as maize, guinea corn, millet, wheat and rice are also grown. In Ayegunle Gbede, agriculture contributed more than 75 percent of export earnings before 1970. Since then, however, agriculture has stagnated, partly due to government neglect, poor investment, and partly due to ecological factors such as drought, disease, and reduction in soil fertility. Fruits, mangoes, oranges and pineapples are produced in abundant during the raining season. Also produced are hot peppers of various types. The vegetation is suitable for a variety of crops. As at today, about 60% of Ayegunle Gbede people are involved in farming or agricultural related occupation and the farming is practiced during the raining and dry seasons without irrigation. Ayegunle Gbede is the largest producer of pepper and tobacco in the area till date. Other sources of livelihood of Ayegunle Gbede people include: commerce, petty trading and small scale business enterprises such as bakery, soap-making, pure water production, block production, honey production, oil palm production, poultry business, tailoring, brick-layering, carpentry work etc. Ayegunle Gbede is blessed and endowed with both human, solid mineral resources and mineral substances of definite chemical composition formed by the inorganic process of nature that could be harnessed for development if properly utilized. RELIGION Before the advent of Christianity and Islam on our land, Ayegunle Gbede people were known to be ‚ÄòIdol and Masquerade Worshippers‚Äò. Some of their popular idols and cults were Ofosi, Imole and Iworo. According to Alhaji Yusuf Ibrahim of Okeleti Quarters and Mallam Abdulsalami Ologe (Baba Gata) of Agoh Quarters, the people of Ayegunle Gbede have their own idol(s) which each community do worship base on their own arrangement. Egungun (masquerade) especially Ojigido were also paraded on certain occasions. While the Imole and Egungun Cult groups are for men, women also had their own cult group i.e. Ofosi. Ofosi Cult group usually spoke in different languages that was not understood by all and sundry. Ofosi Cult was believed to have power to be able to call people home by the use of spiritual means that transcends human imagination and understanding. However, Islam and Christianity are the two main religions practicing by the people of Ayegunle Gbede as at today. Ayegunle Gbede people seem to tolerate one another to a large extent. There is intermarriage among the two religion adherents. PAST HEROES Ayegunle Gbede heroes past includes Late Rev. James Osadare Olorunyomi, Late Hon. (Dr.) Kashim Olarewaju Ndako (Former member of the Kogi State House of Assembly), Late Zacchaeus Abere-Ona Alabi, Late Oba Umar Olorunmaye Lapinni ( former Olu of Ayegunle Gbede), Late Joshua Olorundare Nihi (Former Caretaker Chairman of Old Oyi Local Government Area, Old Kwara State), Late Prince Rotimi Yakub Obadofin, Late Solomon Taye Asaju, and Late Dr. Emmanuel Bolaji Eleta etc. CLIMATE The town enjoys basically two seasons (short dry season November to February and long rain season of March to October). There are also the proliferation of mountains, hills and other resources of different size and shapes all over Ayegunle Gbede land. There are some resources which are visually in large commercial quantities, yet to be harnessed or untapped from the soil.

The project started in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside neighbourhood in 2003, and has since expanded to include the rest of Vancouver and Victoria. Each year Megaphone (the organization that runs the project) distributes disposable film cameras to the low-income community and asks them to portray their community from their own perspective. A selection of the contest's best images are featured in the annual Hope in Shadows calendar, which people experiencing poverty can sign up to sell for a profit. Contest =Photography contest= Started in 2003 by Pivot Legal Society, the annual photography contest is an opportunity for people experiencing poverty (including Downtown Eastside residents) to portray their neighbourhood through their own eyes and participate in the ongoing dialogue about their community. The contest is open to anyone who is low-income and who is a calendar vendor (a vendor is someone who sells the calendar and Megaphone Magazine). It's free to participate. Camera hand-out day is always abuzz. Between 50 and 200 people participate in free photography workshops and pick up a free contest camera to participate. The images generated in the contest go beyond the usual stereotypes, telling the story of spirit, courage and compassion that reflects the true essence of the low- income community. Contestants are asked to document their daily lives, their friends and family, moments of joy or courage or struggle. Participants have three days to take their photos before returning the camera. Along with $5 they get for returning the camera, they also get a set of their valued prints once they are developed. =Selection of top images= A panel of judges deliberates for hours to choose the top 30 photos from the thousands submitted. Everything from artistic merit to technical quality to emotional impact is considered. Once the top 30 images are selected, the winning photographers and subjects are contacted and invited to talk about their photo and share their personal stories. These stories are used to create captions for the calendar and exhibit.http://www.hopeinshadows.com/article12Oct08.html Next comes community voting where the top 30 images are viewed and voted on by people in the neighbourhood, the vendors who sell the calendar, and the public. =Award ceremony and exhibition= It's October when the much anticipated awards ceremony unrolls. The first-place winner gets $500 and all of the Top 30 winners receive cash prizes, as do all participants who reach the top 30. Everyone gets an enlargement of their photo. Calendar and book Each year, a selection of the contest's best images is featured in the Hope in Shadows calendar, which launches the day of the award ceremony. A collection of personal stories behind some of the stunning contest photographs was co- published by Pivot Legal Society and Arsenal Pulp Press in 2008. The personal narratives in this award-winning book are candid and moving and will challenge the way individuals think about poverty, mental health and drug addiction. Hope in Shadows: Stories and Photographs of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside by Gillian Jerome and Brad Cran has been widely recognized winning the City of Vancouver Book Award and nominated for one of the prestigious BC Book Prizes, Roderick Haig-Brown Regional Prize. Street vendor program Established to create accessible employment opportunities for people impacted by poverty and marginalization, the vendor program has become one of the project's biggest successes. The calendar is sold alongside Megaphone Magazine by street vendors who earn a $10 profit for every $20 calendar or book sold. Anyone who self- identifies as being homeless or living on a low income can become a street vendor for the calendar and Megaphone Magazine. To become a vendor, individuals attend a short orientation session where they learn all the basics of being a street vendor. At the end of the session they get their Vendor Badge and licence, and 1 free jumpstart calendar. After that, they buy each calendar for $10 and sell it to customers for $20, earning $10 for every sale. Every year individuals who successfully sell the calendar achieve personal goals, such as earning enough money to upgrade their living situation, getting off income assistance or making a trip home to visit family.http://www.ctvbc.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20081130/BC_hope_081130/20081130/?hub=BritishColumbiaHome Participants in the project tell us that it builds their self-esteem and helps them gain new skills.

It is taken in herbal medicine for pain relief and other uses. The leaves of Boerhaavia diffusa are often used as a green vegetable in many parts of India. Description Fruit of B. diffusa stuck to face of juvenile sooty tern Boerhaavia diffusa is widely dispersed, occurring throughout India, the Pacific, and southern United States. Flowers are small, around 5 mm in diameter. Pollens are round, roughly 65 microns in diameter. Pollen This wide range is explained by its small fruit, which are very sticky and grow a few inches off the ground, ideally placed to latch on to small migratory birds as they walk by.  Traditional Uses  Having anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties, Boerhavia diffusa (Punarnava) is said to be a good cure for Amavata (a disease in which reduction of Vata Dosha and accumulation of Ama take place in , and simulates rheumatoid arthritis (RA)). The root acts as an anticonvulsant, analgesic, laxative medication that when rubbed in honey can be locally applied for cataract, chronic conjunctivitis and blepharitis. Useful for curing heart diseases, anemia and edema (or oedema), Punarnava is an effective remedy that reduces swelling and foul smell in skin disorders. Apart from the root, Punarnava‚Äôs leaves are also consumed as a vegetarian dish to reduce oedema. As an Ayurvedic medicine, this herb is said to cure disorders like intestinal colic, kidney disorders, cough, hemorrhoids, skin diseases, alcoholism, insomnia, eye diseases, asthma and jaundice,Boerhavia diffusa (Sri Lankan Name Pita Sudu sarana best green medicene for Diabetes .

Economic importance  B. diffusa is widely used as a green leafy vegetable in many Asian and African countries. B. diffusa can be used as a fodder for livestock, but has the potential for contaminating seed stocks, and may harbor pathogens for certain crops, such as eggplants.  Chemistry  Boerhaavia G and Boerhavia H are two rotenoids isolated from B. diffusa. A quinolone alkaloid, lunamarine, isolated from B. diffusa has shown some in vitro anticancer, antiestrogenic, immunomodulatory, and anti-amoebic activity (particularly against Entamoeba histolytica). The plant contains a protein called BDP-30, presumably a ribosome-inactivating protein.

It provides a combination of functionality that may include aggregating monitoring traffic from multiple links, regenerating traffic to multiple tools, pre-filtering traffic to offload tools, and directing traffic according to one-to-one and many-to-many port mappings. Data monitoring switches enable organizations to use their monitoring tools more efficiently, to centralize traffic monitoring functions, and to share tools and traffic access between groups. Some of these devices also provide functionality that helps justify tool purchases and simplify deployment and management of the device itself. Several other terms have been used to describe this class of device, including data access switch, tool aggregator, network packet broker, net tool optimizer, and distributed filter tap.  Function  A data monitoring switch typically provides 24 to 38 ports in a 1U 19-inch chassis, with higher port density devices expected in the future (ask about dimensions from the vendor - devices with higher port density or many card slots may be 2U or larger). Ports may be dedicated as network inputs or tool outputs, or may be configurable as either, with most product trending toward the latter. Network input ports may be paired to provide in-line connectivity (integrated Tap function), or out of band (mirrored) to take input from external network Taps or network switch SPAN ports. Some devices have the ability to interconnect chassis to configure logical systems with hundreds of ports, although user interface complexity can serve as a limiting factor in many products. When a number of monitoring tools are connected to the data monitoring switch‚Äôs tool ports, copies of traffic from any of the network ports can be switched to any of the tools using the data monitoring switch‚Äôs management interface. A unique characteristic of the data monitoring switch, as opposed to matrix switches and aggregating Taps, is that it can support a flexible set of port mappings including: *One network link to one monitoring tool *One network link to many monitoring tools (regeneration) *Many network links to one monitoring tool (aggregation) *Many network links to many monitoring tools (dynamic many-to- many connectivity) In addition to directing monitoring traffic, data monitoring switches are capable of filtering traffic by Layer 2 to Layer 4 protocol criteria such as VLAN or IP address, enabling only traffic of interest to be sent to specific tools. This capability can prevent tool oversubscription and facilitate drilling down on issues. As this is still a relatively new set of technologies, there are several different approaches to the hardware and software configurations. As such, each product sports benefits that none of the competitors includes. Some data monitoring switches offer different management interfaces (fully integrated GUI, automation, etc.), load balancing across multiple tool ports, filtering on patterns in packet payloads, and converting media and data rates so tools can be used to monitor traffic from dissimilar links. The more advanced products offer enhanced security (access control, port permissions, etc.) either on the individual level or by using groups, filter library / archiving, and the ability to manage multiple devices simultaneously from a single interface.  Device Management  Data monitoring switches support either or both of the following internal management interfaces: *A text-based command-line interface (CLI) accessed with a terminal emulation program either locally over a serial port or remotely over a secure (e.g., SSH) network connection; this interface is sometimes preferred by network administrators, although many data center professionals complain that CLI is too complex. *A Web browser based graphical interface; While most vendors offer drag and drop capabilities, there are a wide range of GUI options offered on these products, some requiring CLI and some not. This interface is preferred by IT generalists, executives, and IT stakeholders who manage monitoring but do not have physical access to the data center floor. External interfaces are also available as follows: *A platform (Windows) based server; this interface is preferred for managing a large number of devices through a single interface *Third-party SNMP management tools; this interface in preferred in environments with centralized SNMP management systems such as IBM Tivoli or HP OpenView HP Open View  Advantages  Data monitoring switches facilitate centralizing network traffic monitoring in the NOC. By providing remote monitoring and control, they save the time and expense of traveling to remote locations to install monitoring tools. They make it easier to share tools among groups. With data rate conversion capabilities, they enable 1 Gigabit tools to support 10 Gigabit links, and 10 Gigabit tools to monitor traffic aggregated from multiple 1 Gigabit links. They prevent tool oversubscription by pre-filtering traffic. They can Tap network links directly, instead of relying on switch SPAN ports for monitoring access. Because of their high port densities compared to discreet Taps, they save rack space and power, and can have a lower price per port. They are fully passive, unable to disrupt network traffic in the most commonly found circumstances. (Integrated Taps, if present have fail-to-wire on power failure.) This is compared to SPAN ports, where network traffic can be disrupted if the switch is not properly configured while setting up the SPAN port. Integrating Monitoring Access Into The Network Architecture  Disadvantages  * Data monitoring switches take a simple concept, the passive network Tap, and make it an expensive, complex device that requires configuration and management. * They are non-standard ‚Äì different vendor devices operate and are managed differently. * Entry-level pricing is expensive ‚Äì if just a few links or tools need to be instrumented, price per port will be high. * Advanced functionality on some products can be very cumbersome to activate and maintain over time. * Command Line interfaces are often required for the vast majority of the functions, even on many boxes that also offer a GUI. While CLI offers a great deal of control over the operations of the box, only the utmost of advanced users will be able to configure filtering and connections using CLI without overlooking problems such as filter overlaps, replication and accuracy checks, and ongoing active system management.

He joined the grassroots movement to resist both colonial oppression by the British, and also the feudal oppression of the landed Indian gentry. Chittaprosad rejected the classicism of the Bengal School and its spiritual preoccupations. Due to his refusal to accept the discriminations of the caste system, Chittaprosad never used his Brahminical surname during his life.Manifestations I, Santo Datta, Delhi Art Gallery, 2003, New Delhi He wrote articles and produced incisive cartoons and illustrations that displayed a natural talent for draughtsmanship. Career and style Chittraprosad‚Äôs most creative years began in the 1930s. He satirized and sharply criticized the feudal and colonial systems in quickly drawn but masterful pen and ink sketches. The artist/reformer was also proficient at creating linocuts and woodcuts with obvious propagandistic intent. Since these cheaply made prints were created for the masses rather than the art gallery, they were seldom signed or numbered. With time they took on value as art, and today are prized by collectors.Collection of Indian Printmaking, www.waswoxwaswoartcollection.blogspot.com In 1943 Chittaprosad covered the Bengal Famine for various communist publications. This resulted in his first publication, Hungry Bengal. It was a sharply provocative attack on the political and social powers of the time, and the authorities suppressed it nearly immediately, impounding and destroying large numbers.Manifestations III, Geeta Doctor, Delhi Art Gallery, 2005, Chittaprosad settled more permanently in Bombay from 1946 onward. The transformations that the Communist Party took between 1948 and 1949 caused the artist to disassociate himself, though he continued to pursue political themes in his art to the end of his life. In the years before his death, the artist devoted more and more time to the world peace movement, and various efforts to help impoverished children. He is represented in the National Museum, Prague, The National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, Osians Art Archive, Mumbai, and the Jane and Kito de Boer Collection, Dubai.

Nierenberg was born on May 20, 1923, the son of businessman Albert Nierenberg and his wife Rose. He majored in engineering management at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Institute of Technology, earning a bachelor of science degree in 1944. After graduation, he worked in the family business that manufactured metal nameplates for appliances.Fox, Margalit. \\"Theodore Nierenberg, Founder of Dansk, Dies at 86\\", The New York Times, August 3, 2009. Accessed August 4, 2009. On a trip to Europe in May 1954, Ted and his wife Martha Nierenberg visited a museum in Copenhagen, where he saw a set of unique cutlery on display that combined teak handles and stainless steel, created by artist and industrial designer Jens Harald Quistgaard.Fox, Margalit. \\"Jens Quistgaard, 88, a Designer of Popular Tableware, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, February 2, 2008. Accessed August 4, 2009. Nierenberg tracked down Quistgaard and spoke with him in an effort to convince him to manufacture the cutlery, but Quistgaard insisted that the pieces could only be forged by hand, one piece at a time. Nierenberg was able to convince Quistgaard that the pieces could be mass-produced, leading to Dansk International Design's first product, the Fjord line, which has been one of the firm's enduring bestsellers. Dansk was established that same year by Nierenberg and his wife in the garage of their Great Neck, New York home, with Quistgaard as its founding designer. By 1956, Nierenberg wasn't certain that American consumers were ready for the spare styling and brought some early samples of stainless steel flatware with sinuous carved wooden handles to a Manhattan store, and was so surprised that the company bought several hundred units on the spot that he almost walked in front of a bus driving down the street.Reif, Rita. \\"Accessories Designed by Dane Proving Popular in U.S. Homes; Jens Quistgaard, Son of Noted Sculptor, a Born Craftsman\\", The New York Times, October 10, 1958.

Dansk relocated to Mount Kisco, New York and was known for its sleek, functional products often made of exotic woods such as teak, combined with enameled metal and stainless steel.

Dog Carrier for travel The two main types are the front openers (these are generally tough plastic boxes with a metal door, such as dog crates) and top openers (these are generally more like cages with a hinged roof), although there are other types. A carrier usually has a handle on top, although some are easier to carry in one's arms rather than using the handle. Styles There are different types and styles of pet carriers available, according to one's specific needs, such as for when traveling by airplane or car and for a pet's species, weight, and size. * Airline pet carriers : When traveling by plane, each airline has its own specifications and requirements to make sure that the pet and other passengers travel safely and comfortably. Some airlines allow travelers to bring their pet on board if they are comfortably accommodated in an airline- approved pet carrier. Even then, usually only small dogs and cats can go in the cabin; otherwise, they have to be in the cargo hold, in specially designed crates such as dog crates. :For pets in the cabin, the general rule is that the carrier must fit underneath the seat in the front of the owner and it must have a waterproof bottom. Also, the carrier must be big enough for the pet to turn around, stand up, and lie down. Furthermore, the kennel has to be ventilated on at least three sides. Crates or kennels that are used in cargo travel must have a metal door that is strong enough to prevent the pet bending it in any way and must have attached the name of the owner and address and also a \\"Live Animal This Side Up\\" notice. * Backpack pet carriers :Backpack pet carriers are suitable for smaller pets when walking. They are also convenient for hiking, shopping, road trips or appointments to the veterinarian. They feature a well-ventilated, comfortable compartment for the pet for safe and enjoyable travel. Some backpack pet carrier models are airline approved so they can be safely used while traveling by plane. :Backpack pet carriers are available in different sizes, colors, materials, and designs. Some have extra pockets which can be used for extra storage. Most of these pet carriers are designed for pets that do not weigh more than 10 lbs. They have ventilation sides and zippered sides for easy use. Some backpack carriers come with wheels which makes it possible to convert a backpack carrier into a roll-along one. * Pet car-seat carriers :Used when traveling by car; these are also called car seats for pets. They provide safety of the pet and they come in various sizes, colors, and designs to fit on the seat of a car. Different sizes can accommodate smaller or larger pets of up to 25 lbs. They can also often be used as pet beds at home or in a hotel. Car seats are normally made of fleece and are filled with foam for comfort. :For increased safety, and for larger pets, sturdy crates are used. :There are modern variations of crates such as Carrie NOWWe. Unlike cages, they have a safety net, which keeps pet's travel stress-free. It also comes with an easy open gate to help an owner to communicate with a pet during the ride. 12 CAR TRAVEL ESSENTIALS FOR YOUR DOGS by Australian Dog Lover * Sherpa carriers * Soft-sided pet carriers * Purse carriers :These are designed for pets that do not weigh more than 12 pounds and come in a variety of sizes, designs, and colors. They typically have a reinforced floor for the safety of the pet. They are equipped with ventilation holes and a roll-down mesh window.

Prior to launching the Tigers, the Leafs were affiliated with the New Brunswick Hawks of the American Hockey League (AHL), which they shared with the Chicago Black Hawks. However, Harold Ballard, owner of the Leafs, decided that they needed a developmental team of their own, with a spokesperson citing the limited number of roster spots as the rationale for the move.

It developed into an orchestra specialising in rarely heard late 19th and 20th century repertoire. It is based in London. With Corp as Artistic Director, the Orchestra has helped to bring the music of Martin≈Ø to a wider audience and to re-establish the popularity of British Light Music through a series of recordings on the independent label Hyperion Records. In the field of education, the Orchestra has devised projects which use music as a tool to enhance learning in the key curriculum subjects of maths, literacy and science. Following its 'Newham Welcomes the World' community project, the NLO has focused its concert-giving and outreach work in the local community in the London Borough of Newham. The orchestra is independent of public funding, being reliant on private sponsorship and donations.  History  A characteristic of the New London Orchestra (NLO) has been its programming of unusual repertoire, including lesser-known works by famous composers and pieces by little-known composers.See NLO website, Composers who have been featured include Martin≈Ø, a piece of whose music was programmed in every concert from the Orchestra's launch until his centenary in 1990, as well as Ibert, Milhaud, Kabalevsky, Honegger, Roussel and Sibelius. = 1990s = The NLO played at four Proms in the 1990s: the first was in 1991 at an all-Prokofiev 'Children's Prom' (8 September); the second in 1995 for a 'Young Person's Concert' with music from six countries (27 August); a Prom of Russian and American music in 1998 (31 August); and an all-French programme the following year (29 August).See concert details at On 23 November 1991 the Orchestra presented the London premi√®re of the Swiss composer, Frank Martin's Requiem at the Royal Festival Hall as part of 'Swiss Fest 700'.Printed New London Orchestra concert programme(s). In 1995 at St. John's, Smith Square it gave a series of concerts called 'London Firsts', each of which included London premi√®res of works such as Rodrigo's Tres Viejos Aires de Danza (16 March), Anton√≠n Tuƒçapsk√Ω's Violin Concerto, Roger Steptoe's Flute Concerto (18 May), Naji Hakim's Saul of Tarsus (29 June), Malcolm Arnold's Recorder Concerto (2 December) and the world concert premi√®re of Frederick Delius's Idylle de Printemps (2 November). A 'British Concerto Series' followed in 1996 with, for example, Gavin Bryars' Cello Concerto 'Farewell to Philosophy' on 30 October, as did an 'American Connections' series including music by Copland, Bloch, Piston, Kurt Weill and Bernstein, among others. = 2000 to the present = 2002 saw another themed series ‚Äì 'Passing through Paris' ‚Äì four concerts devoted to composers, French or otherwise, with Parisian connections. These took place at UCL Bloomsbury, one of them juxtaposing Berlioz' Roman Carnival Overture with Milhaud's Carnaval de Londres. 'A Musical Celebration of the Bloomsbury Group' featured works ranging from John Blow, Handel, Ethyl Smyth and Elgar to Britten, Bridge and Debussy (22 June 2004). As part of the 2009-10 'Polskayear' and with the support of the Polish Cultural Institute, a concert of English and Polish music ‚Äì Szymanowski, Panufnik and Gra≈ºyna Bacewicz ‚Äì was put on at Cadogan Hall on 14 October 2009. Composers and pieces featured in the NLO's recordings have naturally had a place in its live concerts, Sullivan, Monkton, Poulenc and Prokofiev among them. Concerts of light music have included pieces found on the 'Light Music Classics' series of discs. Works by the following British composers have also been programmed: Holbrooke, Finzi, Cyril Rootham, Rawsthorne, Dyson, Howard Blake and Richard Blackford. In keeping with the NLO ethos, lesser-known works by well-known composers have been played, for example Holst's A Fugal Overture, Vaughan Williams' The Running Set and Jan√°ƒçek's Adagio. Other little-known European music to be heard has been by Arensky, Jean Fran√ßaix, the Albanian-born Thoma Simaku and the Czech, V√≠tƒõzslava Kapr√°lov√°. Seldom-performed piano concertos which the New London Orchestra has programmed include those by Andrew Simpson, Howard Ferguson and Reynaldo Hahn. After initiating its 'Newham Welcomes the World' community project in 2007, the NLO began to focus its concert-giving activity in the London Borough of Newham. This started in March 2009 with a concert at the Stratford Rex featuring the actress Michelle Collins narrating Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, followed two months later by a performance at Stratford Circus of Saint-Sa√´ns' Carnival of the Animals.See concert details at From the start of the 2011-12 concert season, the NLO became the first orchestra-in-residence at Stratford Circus, starting with a concert on 21 October titled 'Sounds of London' which programmed a variety of shorter pieces by composers with London associations, from Haydn, Ket√®lbey and William Alwyn to Stephen Dodgson, Phyllis Tate, Eric Coates and Robert Farnon.See concert details at The season continued with a showing of the film The Snowman accompanied by the NLO playing Howard Blake‚Äôs music live, alongside other Christmas music.See concert details at A repeat of the live concert of The Snowman took place in 2012.See concert details at A concert for the strings of the NLO, 'Modern Music for Strings' on 19 October 2012, saw an original programme of Britten, Barber, Bart√≥k, Corp, Glass' Company, Max Richter's On the Nature of Daylight and P√§rt's Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten. This again took place at Stratford Circus. The NLO's concerts in Newham have aimed to be affordable and accessible to schools and local community groups, with invitations to school groups to attend rehearsals. = Other concert activity = Since its inception, the Orchestra has accompanied Highgate Choral SocietySee Highgate Choral Society website and The London ChorusSee The London Chorus website in many of their concerts, overseas tours and recordings. In these, it has performed repertoire ranging from J. S. Bach to contemporary composers. The NLO has also promoted 'Young Performers Concert' series at the Foundling Museum, London,See concert details at enabling a number of young award-winning musicians and singers in the UK to give their own recitals, the series being supported by the Musicians Benevolent Fund.  Recordings  The New London Orchestra has made over 20 recordings on the Hyperion label. These fall into three categories: * Four discs of British Light Music Classics and one each of American Light Music Classics and European Light Music Classics. * Orchestral repertoire by composers such as Poulenc, Reynaldo Hahn, Milhaud, Satie, Prokofiev, Piern√© and Virgil Thomson. * Operettas and musicals by the Victorian and Edwardian composers Arthur Sullivan, Sidney Jones, Lionel Monckton and Harold Fraser-Simson. A disc released in November 2009 comprises works for string orchestra by Gra≈ºyna Bacewicz, giving exposure to this composer little known outside of Poland. The issue in late 2010 by the NLO (under Corp) of the first digital recording of Rutland Boughton's opera The Queen of Cornwall was designated 'Disc of The Month' in Opera magazine, March 2011 Fairman, Richard. Review in Opera online magazine, March 2011, 'Disc of the Month' citation at the Association of British Orchestras and 'Editor's Choice' in Gramophone, September 2011.Cited on Presto Classical website,  Education and outreach work  The New London Orchestra's curriculum-based education projects have sought to enhance children's learning in maths, literacy and science through music-based activities. The NLO has worked in the London boroughs of Hammersmith & Fulham, Westminster, Camden, Lambeth, Southwark, Tower Hamlets and Newham. Other projects have included residencies in schools for deaf children,See \\"NLO in deaf schools\\" at workshops with adults with learning difficulties from 'Look Ahead Housing and Care' centres, Reminiscence Projects with the elderly in Camden, workshops with adults in homeless hostels in Camden, and theatre projects with the Bloomsbury Theatre, including a collaboration with City & Islington College called \\"Underground Reflections\\".More information about these at Between 2011 and 2013 the JPMorgan Chase Foundation provided funding for the NLO's three-year 'Literacy Through Music' education project which took place at primary schools in Newham.For more on this, and to see their aims, see = 'Newham Welcomes the World' = Between 2007 and 2012 the NLO devised a series of large-scale projects in the Olympic Borough of Newham, working with a variety of people of all ages from across the borough, and collaborating with a number of local institutions including the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Each year, the NLO worked with different groups within the community to create new music and give performances. These included primary and secondary schools, local sports teams, 'Look Ahead Housing and Care' residents and theatre groups, as well as the 'Ascension Eagles' Cheerleaders and 'East London Dance'. One of its projects culminated in the event 'Pass the Baton' at the Stratford Rex in August 2009 featuring local sports teams performing anthems alongside live orchestral music and electronic music by the DJ Excalibah. Concerts of Britten's Noye's Fludde on 21 and 22 May 2013 at The Chainstore, Trinity Buoy Wharf saw young musicians from Newham Academy of Music and Newham schools playing side-by-side with the NLO‚Äôs professionals, and with Newham primary school children performing as the 'Chorus of Animals'.See concert details at See Newham Recorder article by Melissa York, The events were in collaboration with schools in Lille, France, and the Orchestre National de Lille, who mounted a parallel performance on 28 May 2013 at the Auditorium du Nouveau Si√®cle. The constant between the two countries were the conductor, the adult and child soloists and around 20 French and British children forming part of the Chorus of Animals.

First elected for the Conservative Party, she later served as a Change UK and Liberal Democrat MP. She was Chair of the Health Select Committee from 2014 to 2019 and Chair of the Liaison Committee from 2017 to 2019. Wollaston was born in Woking, Surrey, and studied medicine at Guy's Hospital Medical School. She qualified in 1986 and worked as a junior hospital doctor and then as a general practitioner (GP). After more than 20 years in clinical practice, she ran for political office. She was selected as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Totnes through an open primary; during the campaign, she emphasised that she was not a career politician and had a professional career. At the 2010 general election, she won the seat with an increased majority, increasing it further in 2015. She rebelled against the Cameron‚ÄìClegg government on several key votes ‚Äì voting in favour of a referendum on British membership of the European Union in 2011, for a cut in the EU budget in 2011, and against military intervention in Syria in 2013. In Westminster, she was a vocal proponent of minimum unit pricing for alcohol and spoke out against political patronage. Initially uncertain about which way to vote in the referendum, Wollaston announced in June 2016 that she was no longer supporting the Vote Leave campaign in the referendum on European Union membership and would vote to remain in the EU. In February 2019, she resigned from the Conservatives, along with two of her peers, and joined The Independent Group, later Change UK. Four months later, she quit the party to sit as an independent MP. In August 2019, she joined the Liberal Democrats but lost her seat in the 2019 general election standing as a Liberal Democrat. Early life and education Wollaston was born in February 1962\\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons 2010\\", Times Books, 2010, p. 279. in Woking, Surrey, into a military family. Her family moved frequently during her early years as her father ‚Äì a supplies and catering officer in the Royal Air Force, formerly a diver and bomb disposal specialist in the Royal Navy ‚Äì was posted around the world, including Hong Kong and Malta. Wollaston was educated at service and civilian primary schools, later attending a girls' grammar school in Watford, where she was Head Girl in 1979‚Äì1980. Whilst at secondary school, Wollaston took on a range of part-time jobs, including a Saturday job at her local branch of John Lewis. She left sixth form with high grades in science subjects at A-level, which she needed to study Medicine at university. Medical career In 1980, Wollaston entered Guy's Hospital Medical School in London as a medical student. She took an intercalated degree in pathology in the third year of her undergraduate career, gaining a Bachelor of Science degree in the subject.\\"The Class of 2010\\", Total Politics/Weber Shandwick, London, 2010, p. 330-2. While at Guy's, she met her future husband, Adrian. Alongside her studies, she took a part-time role as a healthcare assistant at the hospital to supplement her student grant. Wollaston graduated with a degree in Medicine in 1986. She embarked on a career in hospital paediatrics but, after five years as a junior doctor in London, she moved to Bristol to train as a general practitioner, qualifying as a family doctor in 1992. Wollaston then moved to Devon to work as a part-time GP in a town on the edge of Dartmoor. She was also a police surgeon from 1996 to 2001, dealing with victims of sexual assaults, advising the police on whether suspects were fit to be interviewed, and treating people in custody. After 1999, she became a full-time GP; she taught medical students and trainee GPs, and worked as an examiner for the Royal College of General Practitioners. Wollaston remains on the medical register, but ceased practising medicine in 2010 on her election to Parliament. 2009 open primary and selection Wollaston joined the Conservative Party in 2006, having been spurred into politics by her opposition to the threatened closure of Moretonhampstead Community Hospital.\\"Three candidates for pioneering public vote are named\\", Western Morning News, 15 July 2009, p. 3. However, Wollaston accepted that she had \\"no background in politics\\" when in 2009 she put her name forward for the selection of a candidate for the Totnes constituency, citing as qualifications \\"only real life experience, approachability and enthusiasm\\".\\"Choosing your Tory candidate\\", Herald Express, 23 July 2009, p. 10. The Conservative Association placed her on the shortlist of three to succeed Anthony Steen, who had announced his retirement after criticism as part of the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal. Urged to do so by the national party, the local Conservative Association had already decided that the selection would be made by an open primary, in which non-members would have a vote.Allan Tudor, \\"Party workers backing under-fire Teign MP\\", Herald Express, 2 June 2009, p. 6. On 9 July, the Conservative Party leader David Cameron announced that the party would, for the first time, send a postal ballot paper to every voter instead of holding the selection at an open meeting.Steve Peacock, \\"Voters will choose new Tory candidate\\", Herald Express, 10 July 2009, p. 5. Wollaston later said that she might not have put her name forward had she known that the selection was to be by open primary.Olivier Vergnault, \\"Tories face 400 voters in first open primary\\", Western Morning News, 27 July 2009, p. 8. During the selection process, Wollaston campaigned on the problems of alcohol-related crime, citing also the 8,000 annual deaths from alcohol. She later supported curbs on low priced alcoholic drinks. but highlighted that the selection offered voters a choice between a career politician and \\"someone with a real job\\".Louise Vennells, \\"All constituents can select new Tory candidate\\", Western Morning News, 25 July 2009, p. 11. At a public hustings, she was asked whether her lack of political experience would make it difficult for her to throw and take political punches; she replied that this was not what politics was about for her, and that she would not indulge in it. Her reply prompted spontaneous applause.Matthew Parris, \\"It's queer, this letter from Coutts\\", The Times, 30 July 2009, p. 22; \\"I am proud to have joined the Totnes Tories in a pioneering political evening\\", The Spectator, 1 August 2009. The primary was conducted under the plurality (\\"first past the post\\") method used in general elections. In the selection result, Wollaston was proclaimed the winner with 7,914 votes (48%), ahead of Sara Randall Johnson (leader of East Devon District Council) who had 5,495 (33%), and Nick Bye (Mayor of Torbay) who had 3,088 (19%). Nearly a quarter of all voters returned their ballots, a higher turnout than was expected.Louise Vennells, \\"Doctor victorious in historic public vote\\", Western Morning News, 5 August 2009, p. 5. Wollaston later said \\"I have no doubt that I was selected because I had no track record in politics\\", but one Totnes Conservative member told The Guardian of his fear that without a political background, she was the candidate Liberal Democrats could most easily defeat. As the general election approached, Wollaston made clear her anger at suggestions that she would be a part-time MP, saying that she would not continue her medical practice if elected. The local branch of Liberal Democrats denied that they were behind rumours that Wollaston intended to continue to practise medicine on a part-time basis.\\"'I won't be a part-time MP' vows GP running for election\\", Western Morning News, 10 March 2010, p. 8. She accepted that the scandal over Anthony Steen's expenses claims had damaged the Conservative Party's chances,\\"Tory candidate admits fears over expenses\\", Western Morning News, 16 April 2010, p. 5. and declined his offer of the use of his home to run the Conservative campaign.\\"Election Diary\\", Western Morning News, 19 April 2010, p. 6. She pledged to vote in a eurosceptic direction and to support a bypass for Kingskerswell.Constituency profile, Herald Express, 29 April 2010, p. 7.

She supported the formation of a Conservative‚ÄìLiberal Democrat coalition government as being the most appropriate for her constituency in the circumstances after the election,Matt Chorley, \\"Cameron leads first coalition for 70 years\\", Western Morning News, 12 May 2010, p. 1. explaining that voters wanted to see politicians working together.Tina Crowson, \\"Parties reject truce plea\\", Herald Express, 13 May 2010, p. 1.

Soon after her election, Wollaston was offered the position of Parliamentary Private Secretary ‚Äì a junior aide ‚Äì to one of the Health Ministers, influenced by her professional background. Despite this position being the first rung on the ministerial ladder, Wollaston turned the offer down because it would have required her to avoid speaking out against any Government policy she disagreed with. She later said that she would not have been able to \\"look [her] constituents in the eye\\" if she had signed away her ability to speak on the issues she had been elected on. In her first year in the Commons, Wollaston referred to her experience working with sexual assault victims in warning the Government against its plans to introduce anonymity for people suspected of, or charged with, rape. She argued that it would constitute a \\"further barrier\\" for victims to report their crime and that the vast majority of sexual assaults already went unreported.Francis Elliott, \\"Tory women MPs attack rape suspect anonymity plan\\", The Times, 9 July 2010, p. 8. She successfully pressed the Government to take up the way the European Union's Working Time Directive applied to junior doctors' training, saying that it was causing patient care to suffer.Rebecca Smith, Robert Winnett, \\"EU law harming doctors' training\\", The Daily Telegraph, 8 September 2010, p. 1. In October 2010, she announced she would not vote to repeal the Hunting Act 2004 because \\"the overwhelming majority\\" in her constituency were opposed to hunting.Owen Bowcott, \\"Countryside Alliance outfoxed by new generation of Tory MPs\\", The Guardian, 29 October 2010, p. 20.

Hansard , HC 6ser vol 518 col 323. In March 2013, Wollaston was reselected by her local Conservative Association to fight the 2015 general election as the Conservative candidate. On polling day she was re-elected with 53% of the vote, more than tripling her majority to 18,285 (38.8%). When campaigning for re-election at the 2017 general election, Wollaston promised her constituents, at a hustings, that she would \\"accept the result\\" of the 2016 EU referendum, noting that 54% of her constituents had voted to leave. She went on to state that \\"one of the things that annoys people is telling them that they didn't know what they were voting for\\", rejecting the idea of holding a second referendum. She was returned with a reduced majority of 13,477, despite gaining 2,031 more votes.election 2017: Totnes at bbc.com retrieved 18 July 2017 She was appointed Chair of the Liaison Committee after the election. On 20 February 2019, Wollaston resigned from the Conservative Party, along with two other MPs from her party, joining The Independent Group, later styled Change UK, a party advocating for a second referendum. Prior to her defection, 50 local Conservatives signed a petition calling for a no-confidence vote in Wollaston over her position on Brexit, though one of the petition organisers admitted that he had only recently joined the party in order to seek her deselection.\\"MP Sarah resigns from Tory Party\\", Dartmouth Chronicle, 22 February 2019. Retrieved 15 August 2019 In March 2019, it emerged she had sponsored a Ten Minute Rule bill in November 2011 which would have required MPs who switch parties to face an automatic by- election. Wollaston herself switched parties on 20 February 2019, but did not call a by-election. Chair of Totnes and South Devon Labour Party Lynn Alderson said Wollaston \\"made her views clear\\". Wollaston acknowledged the likely calls for her to face a by-election but refused such a proposal, stating \\"neither this nor a general election would answer the fundamental question that is dividing us\\". In June 2019, she left Change UK to sit as an independent MP. Wollaston was the sponsor of the Stalking Protection Act 2019. On 14 August 2019, Wollaston joined the Liberal Democrats campaigning under the slogan \\"Stop Brexit\\". She sought re-election as Liberal Democrat candidate for Totnes, but finished second to the Conservative party candidate Anthony Mangnall, losing by a margin of 12,724 votes. Political positions =Health= In March 2011, Wollaston warned David Cameron that the government's NHS reforms would result in the NHS going \\"belly up\\". She warned that the reorganisation would result in confusion with doctors being overwhelmed. She said there was a risk that Monitor, the new regulator would be filled with \\"competition economists\\" who would change the NHS beyond recognition and there was no point \\"liberating\\" the NHS from political control only to shackle it to an unelected economic regulator. However, her opposition to the NHS reforms calmed after the party leadership changed certain clauses at her suggestions and she eventually voted in favour of passage of the Health and Social Care Bill. During her campaign for selection as Conservative candidate in Totnes, Wollaston pledged to tackle the issue of alcohol misuse, having seen the impact of it during her medical career. In Westminster, she pushed for an introduction of minimum unit pricing for alcohol, arguing that a 50p minimum unit price would save almost 3,000 lives a year and save the NHS over ¬£6bn over ten years while costing a moderate drinker only ¬£12 extra per year. When plans to introduce minimum pricing were shelved by the Government in 2013, Wollaston strongly criticised David Cameron and Department for Health Ministers, saying that the change in policy was due to lobbying by Conservative Party strategist Lynton Crosby, whose firm had strong ties to the alcohol industry. Following her comments, she was named MP of the Month by Total Politics for her tough stance. Having been on the draft Bill Committee for the Care and Support Bill, Wollaston was selected to sit on the Public Bill Committee for the Care Bill in early 2014. There she introduced a number of amendments, including one which would have made terminally ill patients exempt from social care charges. Wollaston was elected as a member of the Health Select Committee upon entering Parliament, and became Chair of the Committee in June 2014 after Stephen Dorrell retired. She defeated fellow GP Phillip Lee, Caroline Spelman, Charlotte Leslie, and David Tredinnick to the role. She was re-elected to this position after the 2015 general election. In 2015, an undercover Daily Telegraph investigation showed that in some cases, locum agencies Medicare and Team24, owned by Capita, were charging some hospitals higher fees than others and giving false company details. The agencies were charging up to 49% of the fee. Wollaston said the Government should publish details of agency charges as transparency would \\"drive changes to behaviour\\". Wollaston was reckoned by the Health Service Journal to be the 20th-most influential person (and second-most influential woman) in the English NHS in 2015. =Social issues= Before entering the House of Commons, Wollaston stated that she was \\"strongly pro-choice\\", and would not support lowering the abortion limit, as such a measure would affect those who are in the greatest need. In 2011, she voted against backbench amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill which would have prevented abortion providers from offering counselling services. Wollaston voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriage in 2013, writing that \\"people who are gay should be allowed to celebrate their love and commitment in a context that society understands\\". She branded opponents of the change \\"bigots\\". Wollaston rebelled against the Government to vote against setting up a Royal Charter to regulate the press, claiming that many of the activities which had led to the proposal were already illegal and were being exploited to justify censoring the free press. Later, she was the joint winner of The Spectator magazine's Parliamentarian of the Year award for her stance. In September 2013, she entered the debate about niqƒÅbs, saying that some women found them offensive and urging the Government to ban them in schools on the grounds of gender equality. Wollaston was the only Conservative politician to vote for a pause in the roll-out of Universal Credit on 18 October 2017. The vote was non-binding on the government. =Political reform= Coming from a non-political background, Wollaston has consistently spoken out in favour of reforming the political system to make it more open and accessible. Citing her own experience in the medical profession, she has called for job-sharing in the Commons, claiming that this would make it easier for women and those with families to stand for Parliament, while helping to improve the experience of MPs. In 2013, she was a signatory to a campaign for women to be able to inherit noble titles, instead of these being restricted to the male line. She has often spoken out against political patronage in Westminster and the role of the payroll vote in silencing dissent amongst MPs. She has suggested that vacancies for Parliamentary Private Secretary roles should put out for application and interview to find the most qualified candidate, rather than the candidate most in favour with the government. Following her selection through the open primary process, she urged the leaders of all parties to expand their use, particularly in safe seats. She said that the cost could be significantly lower than that of the Totnes primary by combining local and European elections with primary elections. In 2013, she suggested that the idea of expanding primaries had been 'shelved' because it was felt that they produce 'awkward' independently- minded MPs. =Foreign and European policy= In August 2013, Wollaston rebelled and voted against military intervention in Syria. She said such a move could escalate into a wider conflict with hundreds of thousands of victims. She cited strong opposition to intervention by her constituents as a key factor in deciding to vote against. On the European Union, Wollaston originally supported loosening the relationship between Britain and Brussels and said that she would reluctantly vote to leave the EU if reform could not be achieved. Writing for ConservativeHome in 2013, she expressed support for EU membership because of access to the single market, but questioned whether it was worth the extra bureaucracy for business, loss of sovereignty, and the deficit in democracy. In the House of Commons, she voted in a Eurosceptic manner in several key divisions, voting for a referendum on Britain's EU membership and voting to reduce the EU budget. Wollaston initially supported the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum on European Union membership, stating in an article in The Guardian following David Cameron's renegotiation of membership terms in February 2016 that \\"the prime minister has returned with a threadbare deal that has highlighted our powerlessness to effect institutional change\\" and that \\"the balance of our national interest now lies outside the EU\\". However, she announced on 8 June 2016 that she would change sides to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU, claiming that Vote Leave's assertion that exiting the union would make available ¬£350m a week for health spending \\"simply isn't true\\" and represented \\"post-truth politics\\". She also suggested that leaving the EU would harm the UK's economy, leading to a \\"Brexit penalty\\". Michael Deacon of The Daily Telegraph wrote her decision to switch sides had sparked a conspiracy theory among many Leave campaigners that she was a \\"government plant\\", while fellow Conservative MP and Eurosceptic Nadine Dorries said that Wollaston's change of opinion was \\"deliberately staged and political\\". In December 2017, Wollaston voted along with fellow Conservative Dominic Grieve and nine other Conservative MPs against the government, and in favour of guaranteeing Parliament a \\"meaningful vote\\" on any deal Theresa May agrees with Brussels over Brexit. She supported the People's Vote campaign for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. Strongly opposing a no-deal Brexit, she said in December 2018: \\"If it becomes the main objective of government policy to deliver no deal and no transition, then the consequences of that would be so horrific for the people I represent then I couldn't stay a member of the Conservative party.\\"Tory MPs could resign whip if no-deal Brexit becomes primary focus, The Guardian. 19 December 2018 She co-founded the group Right to Vote in early 2019. Personal life Wollaston lives in South Devon with her husband Adrian James, a psychiatrist, who is a registrant of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.Chair nominations for Health Committee, Parliament, www.parliament.uk .

He was the son of Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy, Prince of Carignano and his wife, the Maria Angela Caterina d'Este. Biography Born in Turin, he was the third child of four and the eldest son. Made a Knight of the Annunciation in 1696, he married, at Moncalieri on 7 November 1714, Marie Victoire Fran√ßoise of Savoy (1690‚Äì1766), legitimised daughter of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, King of Sardinia and of Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes, Countess of Verrue. His father-in-law showed affection for him but ended up depriving him, in 1717, of his 400,000 livres of annual income because of excessive spending. It was then that he ran away to France, at the end of 1718, in order to take possession of his inheritance. Since he had lost the Ch√¢teau de Cond√© to Jean-Fran√ßois Leriget de La Faye when it was confiscated from his family by Louis XIV on 6 March 1719, he established himself in the h√¥tel de Soissons, which he transformed, with his wife who had followed him there, into a \\"sumptuous gaming house\\" which for a time sheltered the economist John Law. He died, ruined, and his h√¥tel was razed to construct in its place a grain-trading hall, now the site of the Bourse de commerce de Paris. Next to his mother-in- law, Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes, Countess of Verrue, he counted in the 1730's among the most influencial amateurs and art collectors in Paris. He gathered in an important painting collection which was sold after his death in 1742 partly to Louis XV, King of France, and to August III of Poland, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony. He had a passion for the Paris Op√©ra, and was named intendant of the Menus-Plaisirs by Louis XV.

It was intended chiefly to give access for minerals in the Forest of Dean to Sharpness Docks, and the company built a long bridge, in length, over the River Severn. The line opened in 1879. On opening the company entered a partnership with the Severn and Wye Railway; the Sharpness branch of the Midland Railway was transferred into the group, the combined network forming the Severn & Wye and Severn Bridge Railway. The Severn Bridge Railway and the former Midland Railway branch formed the \\"Bridge\\" section of the S&WJR; the former Severn and Wye Railway formed the \\"Forest\\" section. The line was never profitable, being dependent on the colliery activity in the Forest of Dean, and the huge construction cost of the bridge meant that there were heavy, and unaffordable, interest charges, and the S&W;&SBR; Company went into receivership. It was purchased by the Midland Railway and the Great Western Railway jointly, and became known as the Severn and Wye Joint Railway. When the Great Western Railway constructed the Badminton line, shortening its route from London to South Wales. a south-to- west connection was made, the Berkeley Road Loop, giving direct access from the south to Sharpness from 1908. In 1960 two out-of-control petrol barges in the Severn struck a pier of the Severn Bridge and brought it down, severing the line. After much deliberation the decision was taken to close the line permanently and to demolish the Severn Bridge. The stub from Berkeley Road to Sharpness remains in occasional use in connection with nuclear traffic. Before the bridge =The first Severn Tunnel= The Severn Bridge in an old postcardIn 1810 Richard Wetherell, Roynon Jones the Younger, William and John Fendall and James Jelf were authorised by Act of Parliament to construct a road tunnel under the River Severn from a point about midway between Newnham Church and Bullo Pill to a point in the parish of Arlingham. The Act of 24 May 1810 incorporated the Severn Tunnel Company, with capital of ¬£12,000. The Severn is 1,500 feet wide at the chosen point. A 12-horsepower engine was to drain the tunnel. By August 1811 the construction was proceeding rapidly, and \\"with every prospect of success\\". However, when the construction had reached about halfway, an inundation took place at about four in the afternoon of Friday 13 November 1812. The flooding was considered to be impossible to overcome, and the project was abandoned.H W Paar, The Great Western Railway in Dean: A History of the Railways of the Forest of Dean: Part Two, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, second edition 1971, =The South Wales Railway= Early on proposals were implemented to connect south and south-west Wales to the growing railway network. The South Wales Railway was promoted, and opened its first sections of route in 1850 and 1851; on 19 July 1852 the Chepstow Bridge was opened and the line was continuous from near Gloucester to Swansea, and through running from London was possible. The line was constructed on the broad gauge, and was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. In 1856 the SWR completed its line to Neyland, on Milford Haven; a ferry service was operated from Neyland to ports in the south of Ireland. The South Wales Railway was absorbed by the Great Western Railway in 1863. Although the trunk line from Neyland and Swansea connected to the Great Western system, the heavy mineral traffic from South Wales was not greatly transferred to the line. Most of the valley railways were standard gauge, and the transfer to broad gauge wagons was heavily labour-intensive. Coal owners found it more convenient to continue to send their coal to the ports for onward transport by coastal shipping =Bristol and South Wales Union Railway= There was considerable demand for passenger journeys between Bristol and South Wales. Although the journeys could be accomplished by rail via Gloucester, this was a disproportionately circuitous route, and in 1863 the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway was opened, forming a direct railway line to a ferry pier at New Passage, near the present-day community of Severn Beach. A short spur was made on the Welsh side of the River Severn at Portskewett, connecting in to the South Wales Railway main line. In conjunction with the ferry, this made a more convenient passenger route between Bristol and South Wales. =Severn and Wye Railway= The Severn and Wye Railway had started life in 1810 as a plateway running from Lydney Docks to coal and iron ore workings in the Forest of Dean. After opening of the South Wales Railway through Lydney, the Severn and Wye Railway laid a broad gauge track alongside its plateway line from Lydney to Wimberry, a distance of about 3 miles. When the South Wales main line was converted to standard gauge, the S&WR; branch was converted too. =Conversion of the gauge of the South Wales line= The proliferation of standard gauge railways serving the South Wales mineral areas emphasised the inconvenience of the broad gauge on the former South Wales Railway lines. Whatever its technical merits, the discontinuity requiring transshipment of loads was a major commercial disadvantage. The Great Western Railway decided to convert the gauge of the SWR lines and its own lines connecting with them. This was done in a large scale operation in 1872, and in a short space of time the broad gauge had been eliminated on South Wales, enabling the GWR to develop mineral haulage from the area to London, West of England and South Coast destinations. =Sharpness docks= The Severn Railway Bridge, from near PurtonThe Gloucester and Berkeley Canal, usually known later as the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, was built between 1798 and 1827, to give sea-going ships access to Gloucester. It was the first ship canal in Great Britain. There was a sea lock at Sharpness, on the eastern shore of the Severn. By 1870 the canal was inadequate for the ships of the day, which discharged at Sharpness, and required to bunker.T G Grey-Davies, Masterpieces of a Past Age, in the Railway Magazine, September 1967 In 1871 work was started on docks at Sharpness, as a convenient place to which larger sea-going shipping could be brought.W J Sivewright, Civil Engineering Heritage: Wales and Western England, Thomas Telford Limited, London, 1986, The Midland Railway was operating the main line between Bristol and Gloucester, and the Midland obtained authorisation for a branch line from Berkeley Road on that line to Sharpness. Crossing the Severn The idea of a bridge over the River Severn had long been held. Brunel's first intention for the South Wales Railway was for the line to cross the Severn by bridge, at Hock Cliffe between Fretherne and Awre. This was strenuously opposed in Parliament in 1845 by interests in Gloucester, which strongly wished the line to pass through their city, and Brunel was obliged to take the line round through Gloucester. In 1865 there was a sudden upsurge of interest in a bridge or tunnel; the bridge was proposed by the South Wales and Great Western Direct Railway, which proposed a line similar to the later Wootton Bassett  Badminton  Pilning line, but crossing the Severn from Oldbury Sand to Chepstow, a little north-east of the 1966 Severn Road Bridge. Because of shipping requirements at this location, the bridge had to be designed to give a high clearance over the water, and this proposal was known as the High Level Scheme. Two more groups proposed bridges further up river, near Newnham and at Hock Crib respectively. Although these ideas gained considerable traction, all of them were withdrawn without any construction taking place. In the latter half of 1871 a revival of interest took place, and six schemes for a Severn Railway Bridge were promoted. Some of them had ambitious connections to distant networks; the South Midland Railway would run from Lydney over the Severn to join the London and South Western Railway at Andover and Basingstoke. Severn Bridge Railway Of the six schemes, it was the Severn Bridge Railway Bill (No 2) that became the front runner. Its primary objective was to connect the growing Sharpness harbour with the mineral resources of the Forest of Dean. Lydney Harbour had long been outgrown, being limited to vessels of 400 tons. Sea-going vessels discharging at Sharpness or Gloucester had to move to Cardiff to bunker. As well as the internal export potential at Sharpness, the connection with the Midland Railway would give rail transit possibilities. A footway on the bridge would enable pedestrian use (but this was later omitted). In addition it was held that the connection with the Great Western Railway, which had running powers over the Bristol line at Berkeley Road, would afford transit opportunities to the south-west of England, and shorten the GWR route from South Wales to London by 14 miles.Via Berkeley Road, reverse, and Bristol Temple Meads, reverse, compared with the GWR route via Gloucester. The promoters relied > on the traffic of the immediate district as the undoubted justification for > the line, and believed that it alone would be quite adequate to provide a > remunerative dividend on the cost of the undertaking; but at the same time > they could not ignore the prospects of the exceptional returns which they > believed would result from the accommodation of through traffic.Huxley, page > 26 After several days in Parliamentary Committee, during which the bridge was modified to increase the span of the bridge sections so as to reduce the propensity to silt, the Bill received the Royal Assent on 18 July 1872. It was to build from Lydney, making junctions there with the GWR and the Severn and Wye Railway, to the planned Sharpness branch of the Midland Railway at Sharpness itself. The authorised capital was ¬£225,000.R M Huxley, The Rise and Fall of the Severn Bridge Railway, 1872 - 1970, Amberley Publishing, Stroud, second edition 2008, Rex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railway of Great Britain: volume 13: Thames and Severn, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1981, E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The previous month, on 27 June 1872, the Severn Tunnel Railway had been authorised to build from near Caldicot to near Pilning on the Bristol and South Wales Union line. =Getting subscriptions and construction= The Severn Bridge Railway systemThe estimated cost of construction of the Severn Bridge Railway was ¬£227,973.The estimated cost of construction probably did not include land acquisition costs, and might not have included station construction, signalling, staff uniforms and accommodation, and company secretariat etc.Colin G Maggs, The Severn Bridge Railway, in the Railway Magazine, January 1961 The new Company held its first shareholders' meeting on 31 August 1872. It was declared that amicable relations were intended with the Great Western Railway and the Midland Railway, but that the GWR had remained aloof. The hoped-for amicable relations of course meant financial support. The Midland Railway saw that the bridge would give them access to the Forest of Dean mineral sites, and agreed to subscribe ¬£50,000. The GWR was supporting the newly authorised Severn Tunnel project; moreover the GWR had a monopoly of access to the Forest of Dean's mineral resources; that monopoly would be lost when the bridge was built. The GWR challenged the Midland's subscription of ¬£50,000 as being ultra vires, but arbitration led to its approval. The Gloucester and Berkeley Canal (later known as the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal,The Gloucester and Berkeley Canal had opened in 1827 and in 1872 had only just paid off a heavy and long- standing loan for its own construction works. subscribed ¬£50,000 and the Severn and Wye Railway ¬£25,000.Charles Hadfield, The Canals of South and South East England, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, The bridge construction contract was let to the Hamilton Windsor Iron Works of Liverpool Hamilton's Windsor Ironworks at Grace's Guide in March 1875, in the amount of ¬£190,000, and Vickers and Cook of London were awarded the railway works contract, valued at ¬£90,000. T E Harrison was the engineer. The bridge was to consist of 21 wrought iron bowstring girder spans, with an additional swing bridge at the eastern end crossing the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which ran broadly parallel to the River. There was a 12-arch masonry viaduct approaching the bridge at the western side, and two such arches at the eastern side. The Sharpness branch of the Midland Railway opened on 2 August 1875 to goods traffic, and to passengers on 1 August 1876.John Gough, The Midland Railway: A Chronology, self published by J V Gough, Leicester, 1986, It was only just before this date, on 3 July 1875 that work started on the Severn Bridge Railway. As well as the construction at Garston (near Liverpool) of the bridge spans, the cylinders for the piers needed to be sunk at site. On the eastern side a sand bank called the ridge was in existence, consisting of a mixture of sand and clay, about 30 feet thick. This proved exceptionally difficult to drive the piles by conventional means, and a special method was adopted in which water was pumped down a hollow tube; the water issuing at the lower end removed the clay material there and enabled the driving process to proceed. When the piles were driven it was possible to found the pier cylinders on the underlying rock, and then remove the sand and other material from the interior by conventional hand excavation techniques. The cylinder sections were bolted on progressively, and the whole was later filled with concrete. Temporary staging could now be erected to support the truss erection process; the trusses were assembled using service bolts, and portable forges were employed on the staging to facilitate the process of riveting the joints. In February 1876 it was decided to make the swing bridge over the canal double track; it was argued that to do this later if traffic increased would be exceptionally difficult. The rapid velocity of the current and the tidal range made the work difficult as the navigation channel spans were attempted, and a number of losses of staging, and in some case pier cylinders, were encountered. The railway approaches too, including the tunnel, had experienced difficulty, and due to very slow progress the work was taken from Vickers and Cooke and allocated to Gareth Griffiths of Lydney in 1878. The bridge was completed in August 1879 and permanent way installation commenced on the bridge. L-section guard rails were provided. The bridge superstructure was painted cream, while the piers were painted chocolate above the water line and black below. =Powers for more borrowing= In 1877 a Bill was submitted for powers to take more borrowing, to confirm the double track on the swing bridge, and for additional fender protection for the piers on the river channel, and for \\"the provision of stations, rails, and signals\\". The additional capital needed was ¬£100,000, a 44% increase on the original capital. =Proposed amalgamation= The Severn Bridge Railway, when completed, would be a small concern located between two very powerful networks. The neighbouring Severn and Wye Railway was also considered vulnerable, and in the 1878 session of Parliament a Bill was presented for amalgamating the two. Although, as pointed out by the GWR, the SBR had not yet been completed, the Bill was passed on 21 July 1878. It was to take effect on completion of the SBR line. The two companies would remain in existence, and the combined undertaking would be known as the Severn & Wye and Severn Bridge Railway, with a complex system of allocation of cost and profit between the sections. The arrangement was authorised by Act of 21 July 1879; the two companies were not dissolved: the new Company was jointly owned by them.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Ltd, Sparkford, 1990, =Ready at last= The Severn Bridge Railway was inspected by Colonel Rich of the Board of Trade on 3 and 4 October 1879. A deflection test was undertaken by loading the bridge with eight borrowed locomotives, and the test proved satisfactory, a 1.5 inch deflection being recorded on the longest spans. On 3 September 1879 a special train for directors of the company crossed the bridge. The line was accordingly opened on 17 October 1879. A train consisting of 20 first class coaches passed over the bridge from Sharpness to Lydney and returned, stopping before the bridge to allow those who wished to cross on foot to do so. At weekends the bridge was opened to the general public on foot, pending the start of railway operation. The Severn Bridge itself was 1,387 yards in length and 70 feet above high water. In addition there was a swing bridge 196 feet long over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. There was a branch 57 chains in length to Sharpness docks, duplicating the Midland Railway branch. =Full opening= A train bound for Lydney at Severn Bridge station, looking eastA ceremonial opening of the railway took place on Friday 17 October 1879,E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II: 1863 - 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931 when a further special train crossed the bridge and returned, setting the scene for speeches and a sumptuous banquet. The ordinary service followed, consisting of six trains each way every weekday; it appears that the trains ran through from Berkeley Road to Lydney Town. There was one short working from Sharpness to Lydney Town and back, and two of the trains were mixed.First timetable published in the Gloucester Journal, reproduced in Huxley A 15 mph speed limit was in force on the bridge. As agreed, on the opening day of the SBR it and the S&WR; company merged. The joint share capital of the two concerns was ¬£415,400, and there were loans of ¬£18,500. The new company was known as the Severn and Wye and Severn Bridge Joint Railway. It owned eight locomotives, 26 wagons and four coaches. Portskewett Pier fire Notwithstanding the opening of the Severn Bridge, the normal route for GWR passengers between Bristol and South Wales remained the ferry crossing from New Passage to Portskewett, accessed at the Bristol end by the former Bristol and South Wales Union line, and by a short branch at Portskewett. On 23 May 1881 the Portskewett ferry pier was destroyed by fire, and GWR passengers were conveyed by train from Bristol via Berkeley Road, the Severn Bridge, and Lydney. In fact the journey was 25 minutes quicker than by ferry. However the pier was quickly given temporary repairs and was in use again from 15 June 1881; the ferry service was resumed and the train diversion ceased, \\"to the sorrow of passengers\\". This was also to the sorrow of S&W;&SBR; shareholders, who lost welcome income: the GWR was invited to continue the service after the restoration of the pier, but they declined. Poor financial performance As a small local railway, the Severn Bridge Railway with its partner the Severn and Wye Railway struggled to make a profit. There was a widespread depression in the mineral business, resulting in repeated and prolonged strikes among the miners when wage reductions were imposed, and loss of traffic to the Company. Hope was kept alive to make the line part of a trunk route from South Wales to London, and a bold scheme was put forward to build a new connecting line to join the Gloucester to Swindon line, but this fell through. In 1883 the Directors had to inform a shareholders' meeting that debentures falling due shortly could not be discharged. The combined company was not commercially successful, and went into administration. A scheme of arrangement with its creditors was agreed in 1885, but the line continued in difficult financial circumstances. The apportionment of income and costs between the Bridge section and the Forest (S&WR;) section of the combined company, and between debenture holders and ordinary and preference shareholders continued to be a source of antagonism. In addition much expenditure was necessary in modernising the S&WR; section infrastructure, and in dredging at Lydney. In addition the Forest collieries and iron workings were constantly uncompetitive, and as the railway was wholly dependent on the success or failure of those industries, decline was unstoppable. Severn Tunnel The Severn Tunnel had been authorised by Parliament in the same year as the Severn Bridge Railway. However the construction took a considerable time, and it opened fully to goods trains in September 1886 and for all traffic on 1 December 1886.Thomas A Walker, The Severn Tunnel: Its Construction and Difficulties, 1888 reprinted 2013 by Cambridge University Press, The opening of that line to main line standards finally did away with any hopes that the Severn Bridge might form a trunk link between South Wales and the eastern parts of the GWR. Sale to the GWR and Midland Railway In July 1893 it again became obvious that the Company would be unable to pay debenture interest falling due, and the Company immediately went into administration. There was no hope of escaping by the Company's own efforts, and sale to the GWR and the Midland Railway together was found to be the only way out. A price was agreed, at ¬£477,300. The SBR and the S&WR; together had cost ¬£951,349 to construct. Ordinary shareholders were to get 12%. Part of the arrangement was that the Midland Railway would transfer a half share in their Sharpness branch and in their dock facilities at Sharpness to the GWR, and the whole line from Berkeley Road to Lydney and the S&WR; network would be worked as a single joint entity. This was ratified by Act of Parliament on 17 August 1894 having been operated on that basis from 1 July. The line was now in joint ownership, known as the Severn and Wye Joint Railway. The Midland Railway was responsible for track and signalling maintenance, and the Great Western Railway dealt with the operation, taking over the line's locomotives.Some through goods workings to Sharpness were worked by Midland Railway locomotives, and for a period the Midland Railway operated a Gloucester to Lydney passenger trains, worked by a Midland 0-4-4T locomotive. Most of the S&W;&SBR; locomotives were named after Robin Hood and his band but \\"none of these possessed any features of interest\\".MacDermot, page 567 Badminton line The Severn Bridge system after opening of the Badminton lineIn 1896 the Great Western Railway laid before Parliament proposals to build a new cut-off line, shortening the route from London to South Wales. The new line, later generally known as the Badminton Line,Formally the South Wales & Bristol Direct Railway. was to run from Wootton Bassett to Patchway. The GWR also proposed an independent line from the Badminton line to the Severn and Wye line near Sharpness. This would have paralleled part of the Midland Railway Bristol to Gloucester route, and was opposed in Parliament by the Midland. The GWR already had running powers over the relevant portion of the Bristol to Gloucester line, and a compromise was reached. The GWR would build curves from the Badminton line to the Midland route at Yate, and a south curve at Berkeley Road (\\"the Berkeley Road Loop\\") giving south-to-west access off the Bristol and Gloucester line to Sharpness. These curves were duly authorised, and they were opened on 9 March 1908.Gough gives 2 March 1908 and calls it the Berkeley Loop. The loop was wholly owned by the GWR. The loops at Westerleigh formed a triangle giving access towards Swindon as well as towards Stoke Gifford. Mitchell and Smith say that the Berkeley Road loop \\"was opened purely as a diversionary route for use when the Severn Tunnel was closed\\". The low load capacity of the Severn Bridge frustrated any contemplated use of the route for heavy trains between South Wales and London.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Midland Main Lines: Gloucester to Bristol, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2004, Grouping of the railways In 1923 the railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" under the Railways Act 1921, forming four large railway companies. The Great Western Railway was re-formed, absorbing a number of smaller railways; the Midland Railway was a constituent of a new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The joint line status of the Severn and Wye and Severn Bridge network continued, now jointly under the GWR and the LMS. Singling of the former Midland branch The Midland Railway built its Sharpness branch from Berkeley Road as a double track line. The traffic on the line proved not to be so heavy as to warrant that provision, and on 26 July 1931 the line was singled. Nationalisation On 1 January 1948 the GWR and the LMS, in common with all other main line railways in Great Britain, were taken into national ownership, following the Transport Act, 1947; British Railways operated the lines. In this period the typical locomotive power on the line was tank engines of the 14XX class, or 0-6-0 pannier tanks. Weight limits on the bridge The engine route availability on the bridge since the Grouping had been \\"yellow\\", meaning that only the lightest locomotives could traverse the bridge. Special authorisation was given for the 63XX class of 2-6-0 locomotive to use the bridge during the periods when the Severn Tunnel was closed for maintenance. South Wales to London trains generally ran via Gloucester during these closures. This limitation had long been a source of difficulty in exploiting the bridge, but the LMS, which was responsible for the bridges, had been against relaxing the limitation. In 1955 proposals for investigating the strength of the bridges were developed, and in the following year strain gauge tests were carried out on the Severn Bridge and also all the ordinary metal underbridges on the diversionary route. > On July 15 and 22, \\"Castle\\" class locomotives Nos. 5018, \\"St Mawes\\" and > 5042, \\"Winchester Castle\\", were engaged in a series of tests... After they > had propelled a 500-ton load of ballast wagons on to the bridge, the > locomotives made several runs over the spans on the western (Lydney) side. > The eastern section of the bridge, which includes the opening span over the > Gloucester & Berkeley Ship Canal, was tested on the second Sunday. At > present, former G.W.R. 2-6-0s are the heaviest locomotives used on the > Sunday trains between Bristol and South Wales, which are diverted to this > route while the Severn Tunnel is closed for inspection and maintenance > repairs.Locomotive Notes in the Railway Magazine, November 1956 In fact the strain gauges were malfunctioning on 15 July and a further test run, with only no 5018, was undertaken on 1 August. High secondary stresses were observed in the diagonal bracing members and it was decided to deal with that. A contract was let in the sum of ¬£125,000 for the work.F R L Barnwell, Severn Bridge: Disaster and Demolition, in the Railway Magazine, January 1970 (extracted from a paper in the Journal and Report of Proceedings of the Permanent Way Institution, part II, 1969); F R L Barnwell was Chief Civil Engineer of British Railways Western Region  Damage and closure  =Struck by barges= Wrecks of the Arkendale H and Wastdale H The strengthening work had been completed on 18 spans and work was proceeding on the remainder when the bridge was struck and badly damaged, 30 minutes after the passage of the last passenger train on 25 October 1960. Two barges in the River Severn were out of control in thick fog and struck pier 17, bringing down the pier and the two spans it supported. The vessels were the Wastdale H and the Arkendale H. The displaced spans fell on to the barges and ignited their petrol and oil cargo. In the conflagration, five crew members of the barges died. Still out of control the barges continued upstream on the flood tide and grounded on sandbanks, still carrying 70 yards or so of fallen railway track on their decks. The Chief Civil Engineer of British Railways, Western Region, gave an account of the course of events, summarised from a Board of Admiralty inquiry. A fleet of 26 barges was brought up from Avonmouth: There seems to have been some confusion about how to disengage them from one another and: =Stabilising the bridge= The bridge after the collisionTwo spans collapsed. On the morning following the fall, the first Lydney to Sharpness passenger train ran via Gloucester, but the service was then suspended. On 27 October 1960 a passenger service between Berkeley Road and Sharpness was instituted. This continued until 7 September 1964, when the branch was closed to passenger traffic. A pier adjacent to the fallen pier needed to be stabilised, and this was done by driving a timber pier to support it. During the course of this work, the barge carrying the contractor's piling rig broke away at night when it was anchored unmanned. Again in flood tide conditions to travelled upstream. The Resident Engineer commandeered a power launch and tried to board the barge and take control, but his propellers were fouled by trailing ropes and he was unable to do so. The barge then drifted downstream on the subsequent ebb tide, and the crane jib struck the bridge, causing the collapse of the crane jib. Shortly after this another barge engaged in the work was carried upstream and struck one of the other piers, demolishing the fenders but causing little damage to the piers themselves. Passing the bridge upstream, it later moved downstream again and struck one of the columns, removing about 8 square feet of the cast-iron caisson. The barge capsized three or four miles downstream with total loss of life. =Insurance= The question of insurance arose; at the time the matter was governed by marine insurance law, which limited the compensation according to the weight of the vessel doing the damage. British Railways received less than ¬£5,000 in compensation. The gas board also had a 12-inch gas main fixed to the bridge; they had to lay a new one of about 15 miles in extent, and they received less compensation than British Railways. The contractor who lost compressors and plant to a value in excess of ¬£10,000 received less than ¬£100 in compensation. =Further damage to the bridge= On 17 February 1961 the tanker BP Explorer capsized on approaching Sharpness. Out of control, it drifted upstream with the tide, passing the bridge; it struck pier 20 on travelling downstream again on the ebb tide. Its entire crew were lost, and damage to the extent of ¬£12,740 was caused to the bridge. Two floating cranes had been brought in to assist with the repair work to the bridge; they were the Tweedledum and Tweedledee. On 14 April 1961 they broke away from their moorings on the flood tide and passed above the bridge, then striking the dolphins of pier 20 on the way down on the following ebb tide. The jib of one of the cranes struck the superstructure of the bridge. =Closure of the Berkeley Road Loop= The Berkeley Road Loop had been built by the Great Western Railway when the Badminton line was opened. It had been used by South Wales-to-Bristol trains at weekends when the Severn Tunnel was closed for repairs. Any residual goods train access to Sharpness could be accommodated via Gloucester, and as staffing of two signalboxes was necessary to use the loop, it was decided to close it. The closure took place in 1963. =Demolition= Some considerable time was spent in deciding on the future of the bridge, and a contract was let to commence restoration. However eventually it was decided to demolish the bridge instead. When 24 contractors' firms were invited to quote for the work, 21 of them declined to accept the work. Of the three who quoted, one contractor quoted about ¬£750,000 and another over ¬£200.000. A third quoted about ¬£75.000. This cheapest quotation was accepted, and the firm used a Magnus II salvage crane on hire from Ulrich Harms of Hamburg. Nineteen spans were successfully dismantled, but there remained two larger spans of 108 feet. These were beyond the capacity of the crane, and they were cut so as to fracture when pulled off the supporting piers. Unfortunately when this was done they fell but did not fracture. Only about a quarter of the ironwork of these spans was recovered. After the completion of removal of the superstructure there remained the problem of removing the concrete-filled columns down to 20 feet below water level in the area of navigation. Demolition of the masonry approach viaduct too became much delayed; it was eventually dropped by explosives on 10 March 1968. It was at this stage that the contractor got into financial difficulties and on 20 November 1968 went into liquidation. British Railways continued the work by direct labour, using the firm of Swinnerton and Miller for explosive demolition. =Further shipping disaster= In 1969 a small former car ferry, the Severn King, was employed in assisting with the demolition work and on 4 July she broke adrift and became impaled on the stump of pier no 2. It was necessary to wait for a spring tide high enough to refloat her, and this was done on 28 July; the Severn King was beached at Sharpness and cut up there. =Swing bridge demolition= The final stage of removal of the bridge structure was the demolition of the Sharpness swing bridge, and this was completed on 13 May 1970. Current use The Sharpness branch from Berkeley Road was still in use in 2011; Railway magazine reported: \\"The branch still sees use by occasional DRS trains serving the former Berkeley nuclear power station and the operational Oldbury Magnox station.\\"Railway Magazine, May 2011, page 71 Topography Station list: * Berkeley Road; Midland Railway station (opened 8 July 1844); closed 4 January 1965; * Berkeley; opened 1 August 1876; closed 2 November 1964; * Sharpness; opened by Midland Railway 1 August 1876; relocated to SBR line 16 October 1879; closed 2 November 1964; * Severn Bridge; opened 20 October 1879; closed 26 October 1960; the local community is named \\"Purton\\" but this was not used for the station because of the existing station near Swindon. * tunnel; 508 yards; * Otters Pool Junction; connection from Severn Bridge towards Chepstow; * Lydney Junction; S&WR; station opened 23 September 1875; relocated to SBR line 20 October 1879; SBR section closed 26 October 1960; * Tin Works Junction; convergence with S&WR; main line.

Incumbent mayor Nathan Phillips, then the longest-serving mayor in Toronto history, lost to Controller Donald Summerville by a significant margin. Two major referendums were also held in Metro Toronto. The most controversial was over water fluoridation, which passed by a slim margin of 166,960 to 163,240. The areas outside Toronto also voted to remove some of the last of the Blue Laws by allowing movies to be shown on Sundays, something that was already allowed in the city itself. Toronto mayor Phillips had first been elected to city council in 1926 and was elected mayor in 1954. He had won an unprecedented four elections to become the longest-serving mayor in Toronto history. Summerville was much younger and had first been elected to council in 1955, representing the eastern Beaches area. One of the central issues of the campaign was a desire for change and a more youthful mayor. Summerville won by large margin more than doubling Phillips' total. Summerville won every ward in the city, including Phillips' former area. Less than a year into his term Summerville died of a heart attack while playing hockey, and was replaced by Controller Philip Givens. ;Results :Donald Summerville - 117,031 :Nathan Phillips (incumbent) - 51,933 :Frank Nasso - 4,966 :Ross Dowson - 1,119 :Harry Bradley - 815 :Charles Henry Mahoney - 406 Board of Control Summerville's decision to run for mayor opened one position on the Board of Control, the four-person executive committee elected at large across the city.

The LWE problem is conjectured to be hard to solve, and thus be useful in cryptography. More precisely, the LWE problem is defined as follows. Let \\\\mathbb{Z}_q denote the ring of integers modulo q and let \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n denote the set of n-vectors over \\\\mathbb{Z}_q . There exists a certain unknown linear function f:\\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{Z}_q, and the input to the LWE problem is a sample of pairs (\\\\mathbf{x},y), where \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n and y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q, so that with high probability y=f(\\\\mathbf{x}). Furthermore, the deviation from the equality is according to some known noise model. The problem calls for finding the function f, or some close approximation thereof, with high probability. The LWE problem was introduced by Oded Regev in 2005 (who won the 2018 G√∂del Prize for this work), it is a generalization of the parity learning problem. Regev showed that the LWE problem is as hard to solve as several worst-case lattice problems. Subsequently, the LWE problem has been used as a hardness assumption to create public-key cryptosystems,Oded Regev, ‚ÄúOn lattices, learning with errors, random linear codes, and cryptography,‚Äù in Proceedings of the thirty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (Baltimore, MD, USA: ACM, 2005), 84‚Äì93, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1060590.1060603.Chris Peikert, ‚ÄúPublic- key cryptosystems from the worst-case shortest vector problem: extended abstract,‚Äù in Proceedings of the 41st annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (Bethesda, MD, USA: ACM, 2009), 333‚Äì342, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1536414.1536461. such as the ring learning with errors key exchange by Peikert.  Definition  Denote by \\\\mathbb{T}=\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z} the additive group on reals modulo one. Let \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n be a fixed vector. Let \\\\phi be a fixed probability distribution over \\\\mathbb{T}. Denote by A_{\\\\mathbf{s},\\\\phi} the distribution on \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n \\\\times \\\\mathbb{T} obtained as follows. # Pick a vector \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n from the uniforms distribution over \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n, # Pick a number e\\\\in\\\\mathbb{T} from the distribution \\\\phi, # Evaluate t=\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{a},\\\\mathbf{s} \\\\rangle /q + e, where \\\\textstyle \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{a},\\\\mathbf{s} \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i s_i is the standard inner product in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n, the division is done in the field of reals (or more formally, this \\"division by q\\" is notation for the group homomorphism \\\\mathbb{Z}_q \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{T} mapping 1 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q to 1/q + \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{T}), and the final addition is in \\\\mathbb{T}. # Output the pair (\\\\mathbf{a},t). The learning with errors problem \\\\mathrm{LWE}_{q,\\\\phi} is to find \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n, given access to polynomially many samples of choice from A_{\\\\mathbf{s},\\\\phi}. For every \\\\alpha > 0, denote by D_\\\\alpha the one-dimensional Gaussian with zero mean and variance \\\\alpha^2/(2\\\\pi), that is, the density function is D_\\\\alpha(x)=\\\\rho_\\\\alpha(x)/\\\\alpha where \\\\rho_\\\\alpha(x)=e^{-\\\\pi(x/\\\\alpha)^2}, and let \\\\Psi_\\\\alpha be the distribution on \\\\mathbb{T} obtained by considering D_\\\\alpha modulo one. The version of LWE considered in most of the results would be \\\\mathrm{LWE}_{q,\\\\Psi_\\\\alpha}  Decision version  The LWE problem described above is the search version of the problem. In the decision version (DLWE), the goal is to distinguish between noisy inner products and uniformly random samples from \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n \\\\times \\\\mathbb{T} (practically, some discretized version of it). Regev showed that the decision and search versions are equivalent when q is a prime bounded by some polynomial in n. = Solving decision assuming search = Intuitively, if we have a procedure for the search problem, the decision version can be solved easily: just feed the input samples for the decision problem to the solver for the search problem. Denote the given samples by \\\\\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{a}_i,\\\\mathbf{b}_i)\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{Z}^n_q \\\\times \\\\mathbb{T}. If the solver returns a candidate \\\\mathbf{s}, for all i, calculate \\\\\\\\{\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{a}_i, \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\rangle - \\\\mathbf{b}_i \\\\\\\\} . If the samples are from an LWE distribution, then the results of this calculation will be distributed according \\\\chi, but if the samples are uniformly random, these quantities will be distributed uniformly as well. = Solving search assuming decision = For the other direction, given a solver for the decision problem, the search version can be solved as follows: Recover \\\\mathbf{s} one coordinate at a time. To obtain the first coordinate, \\\\mathbf{s}_1, make a guess k \\\\in Z_q, and do the following. Choose a number r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q uniformly at random. Transform the given samples \\\\\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{a}_i,\\\\mathbf{b}_i)\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{Z}^n_q \\\\times \\\\mathbb{T} as follows. Calculate \\\\\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{a}_i+(r,0,\\\\ldots,0), \\\\mathbf{b}_i + (r k)/q)\\\\\\\\}. Send the transformed samples to the decision solver. If the guess k was correct, the transformation takes the distribution A_{\\\\mathbf{s},\\\\chi} to itself, and otherwise, since q is prime, it takes it to the uniform distribution. So, given a polynomial-time solver for the decision problem that errs with very small probability, since q is bounded by some polynomial in n, it only takes polynomial time to guess every possible value for k and use the solver to see which one is correct. After obtaining \\\\mathbf{s}_1, we follow an analogous procedure for each other coordinate \\\\mathbf{s}_j. Namely, we transform our \\\\mathbf{b}_i samples the same way, and transform our \\\\mathbf{a}_i samples by calculating \\\\mathbf{a}_i + (0, \\\\ldots, r, \\\\ldots, 0), where the r is in the j^\\\\text{th} coordinate. Peikert showed that this reduction, with a small modification, works for any q that is a product of distinct, small (polynomial in n) primes. The main idea is if q = q_1 q_2 \\\\cdots q_t, for each q_{\\\\ell}, guess and check to see if \\\\mathbf{s}_j is congruent to 0 \\\\mod q_{\\\\ell}, and then use the Chinese remainder theorem to recover \\\\mathbf{s}_j. = Average case hardness = Regev showed the random self-reducibility of the LWE and DLWE problems for arbitrary q and \\\\chi. Given samples \\\\\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{a}_i,\\\\mathbf{b}_i)\\\\\\\\} from A_{\\\\mathbf{s},\\\\chi}, it is easy to see that \\\\\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{a}_i,\\\\mathbf{b}_i + \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{a}_i, \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\rangle)/q\\\\\\\\} are samples from A_{\\\\mathbf{s} + \\\\mathbf{t},\\\\chi}. So, suppose there was some set \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n such that \\\\mathcal{S}/\\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n = 1/\\\\operatorname{poly}(n), and for distributions A_{\\\\mathbf{s}',\\\\chi}, with \\\\mathbf{s}' \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathcal{S}, DLWE was easy. Then there would be some distinguisher \\\\mathcal{A}, who, given samples \\\\\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{a}_i,\\\\mathbf{b}_i) \\\\\\\\}, could tell whether they were uniformly random or from A_{\\\\mathbf{s}',\\\\chi}. If we need to distinguish uniformly random samples from A_{\\\\mathbf{s},\\\\chi}, where \\\\mathbf{s} is chosen uniformly at random from \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n, we could simply try different values \\\\mathbf{t} sampled uniformly at random from \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n, calculate \\\\\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{a}_i,\\\\mathbf{b}_i + \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{a}_i, \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\rangle)/q\\\\\\\\} and feed these samples to \\\\mathcal{A}. Since \\\\mathcal{S} comprises a large fraction of \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n, with high probability, if we choose a polynomial number of values for \\\\mathbf{t}, we will find one such that \\\\mathbf{s} + \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}, and \\\\mathcal{A} will successfully distinguish the samples. Thus, no such \\\\mathcal{S} can exist, meaning LWE and DLWE are (up to a polynomial factor) as hard in the average case as they are in the worst case.  Hardness results  = Regev's result = For a n-dimensional lattice L, let smoothing parameter \\\\eta_\\\\varepsilon(L) denote the smallest s such that \\\\rho_{1/s}(L^*\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{0}\\\\\\\\}) \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon where L^* is the dual of L and \\\\rho_\\\\alpha(x)=e^{-\\\\pi(x/\\\\alpha)^2} is extended to sets by summing over function values at each element in the set. Let D_{L,r} denote the discrete Gaussian distribution on L of width r for a lattice L and real r>0. The probability of each x \\\\in L is proportional to \\\\rho_r(x). The discrete Gaussian sampling problem(DGS) is defined as follows: An instance of DGS_\\\\phi is given by an n-dimensional lattice L and a number r \\\\geq \\\\phi(L). The goal is to output a sample from D_{L,r}. Regev shows that there is a reduction from \\\\operatorname{GapSVP}_{100\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\gamma(n)} to DGS_{\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\gamma(n)/\\\\lambda(L^*)} for any function \\\\gamma(n). Regev then shows that there exists an efficient quantum algorithm for DGS_{\\\\sqrt{2n}\\\\eta_\\\\varepsilon(L)/\\\\alpha} given access to an oracle for \\\\mathrm{LWE}_{q,\\\\Psi_\\\\alpha} for integer q and \\\\alpha \\\\in (0,1) such that \\\\alpha q > 2\\\\sqrt{n}. This implies the hardness for LWE. Although the proof of this assertion works for any q, for creating a cryptosystem, the q has to be polynomial in n. = Peikert's result = Peikert proves that there is a probabilistic polynomial time reduction from the \\\\operatorname{GapSVP}_{\\\\zeta,\\\\gamma} problem in the worst case to solving \\\\mathrm{LWE}_{q,\\\\Psi_\\\\alpha} using \\\\operatorname{poly}(n) samples for parameters \\\\alpha \\\\in (0,1), \\\\gamma(n)\\\\geq n/(\\\\alpha \\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}), \\\\zeta(n) \\\\geq \\\\gamma(n) and q \\\\geq (\\\\zeta/\\\\sqrt{n}) \\\\omega \\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}).

In 2005, Regev showed that the decision version of LWE is hard assuming quantum hardness of the lattice problems \\\\mathrm{GapSVP}_\\\\gamma (for \\\\gamma as above) and \\\\mathrm{SIVP}_t with t=O(n/\\\\alpha) ). In 2009, Peikert proved a similar result assuming only the classical hardness of the related problem \\\\mathrm{GapSVP}_{\\\\zeta,\\\\gamma}. The disadvantage of Peikert's result is that it bases itself on a non-standard version of an easier (when compared to SIVP) problem GapSVP. = Public-key cryptosystem = Regev proposed a public-key cryptosystem based on the hardness of the LWE problem. The cryptosystem as well as the proof of security and correctness are completely classical. The system is characterized by m,q and a probability distribution \\\\chi on \\\\mathbb{T}. The setting of the parameters used in proofs of correctness and security is * q \\\\geq 2 , usually a prime number between n^2 and 2n^2. * m=(1+\\\\varepsilon)(n+1) \\\\log q for an arbitrary constant \\\\varepsilon * \\\\chi=\\\\Psi_{\\\\alpha(n)} for \\\\alpha(n) \\\\in o(1/\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\log n), where \\\\Psi_\\\\beta is a probability distribution obtained by sampling a normal variable with mean 0 and standard variation \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} and reducing the result modulo 1. The cryptosystem is then defined by: * Private key: Private key is an \\\\mathbf{s}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n_q chosen uniformly at random. * Public key: Choose m vectors \\\\mathbf{a}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{a}_m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n_q uniformly and independently. Choose error offsets e_1,\\\\ldots,e_m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{T} independently according to \\\\chi. The public key consists of (\\\\mathbf{a}_i,b_i=\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{a}_i,\\\\mathbf{s} \\\\rangle/q + e_i)^m_{i=1} * Encryption: The encryption of a bit x \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} is done by choosing a random subset S of [m] and then defining \\\\operatorname{Enc}(x) as :: \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i \\\\in S} \\\\mathbf{a}_i, \\\\frac x 2 + \\\\sum_{i \\\\in S} b_i\\\\right) * Decryption: The decryption of (\\\\mathbf{a},b) is 0 if b-\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{a}, \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\rangle/q is closer to 0 than to \\\\frac{1}{2}, and 1 otherwise. The proof of correctness follows from choice of parameters and some probability analysis. The proof of security is by reduction to the decision version of LWE: an algorithm for distinguishing between encryptions (with above parameters) of 0 and 1 can be used to distinguish between A_{s,\\\\chi} and the uniform distribution over \\\\mathbb{Z}^n_q \\\\times \\\\mathbb{T} = CCA-secure cryptosystem = Peikert proposed a system that is secure even against any chosen-ciphertext attack. = Key exchange = The idea of using LWE and Ring LWE for key exchange was proposed and filed at the University of Cincinnati in 2011 by Jintai Ding. The idea comes from the associativity of matrix multiplications, and the errors are used to provide the security. The paper appeared in 2012 after a provisional patent application was filed in 2012. The security of the protocol is proven based on the hardness of solving the LWE problem. In 2014, Peikert presented a key-transport scheme following the same basic idea of Ding's, where the new idea of sending an additional 1-bit signal for rounding in Ding's construction is also used. The \\"new hope\\" implementation selected for Google's post-quantum experiment, uses Peikert's scheme with variation in the error distribution.

The ship, said to be operated by COSCO (H.K.) Shipping Co. Ltd., spilled around 200 tons, of IFO-380 heavy fuel oil. The oil contaminated 75 km of Norwegian coastline, including Langesund, Vestfold, and the Lille S√•stein Bird Sanctuary. There were oil slicks in approximately 200 locations along the shoreline between Larvik Municipality and Lilles. Thousands of sea birds were covered in oil, and although volunteers made efforts to save them, many of the birds had to be shot due to the irreversible damage to their health. The Institute of Marine Research ran tests on the affected areas to track any significant ecological impacts but noted that the marine and fish life suffered no significant changes. The research was included in a study of four oil spills that occurred in the Norwegian coastal area, including the Rocknes Oil Spill, the Server Oil Spill, and the Godafoss Oil Spill. The Master and Third Officer of the ship were both charged with violating the Pollution Act due to their failure to take adequate measures to prevent pollution. The Master was sentenced to 6 months with 120 days suspended, and the Third Officer was sentenced to 60 days with 39 days suspended.

A. (1980). Individual differences in working memory and reading. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 19(4), 450‚Äì466. It is a verbal working memory test. Task =Original= The original RST required participants to read series of unconnected sentences aloud and to remember the final word of each sentence of a series (grouped according to the total number of sentences). With each sentence presented on a card, participants were cued to recall the memorized end-of-sentence words in their original order by a blank card at the end of a series. The number of sentences of a series was incrementally increased until a participant's reading span, or the maximum number of final words correctly recalled, was found. The reading span task was the first instance of the family of \\"complex span\\" tasks (as opposed to \\"simple span\\" tasks). It is a complex verbal test because it draws upon both storage and processing (i.e., reading) elements of working memory, while simple verbal tests (e.g., word span) require the storage element alone.Lobley, K.J., Baddeley, A.D., & Gathercole, S.E.

The activities of the city region are coordinated by the Leeds City Region Partnership. Since April 2007 strategic local governance decisions have been made by the joint committee of the Leeds City Region Leaders Board. A multi-area agreement was established in 2008 and since 2011 economic development has been supported by the Leeds City Region LEP, which forms a business-led local enterprise partnership. As part of a 2012 'city deal' a West Yorkshire Combined Authority will be established in order receive devolved powers for transport, economic development and regeneration. The secretariat for the city region is based within Leeds City Council. The Leeds City Region Enterprise Zone promotes development in four sites along the A63 East Leeds Link Road. This sub-region (defined by local labour markets and journey to work areas) covers the whole of West Yorkshire and parts of neighbouring North and South Yorkshire; that is, the ten local authority districts (in order of Population size) Leeds, Bradford, Kirklees, Wakefield, Barnsley, Calderdale, York, Harrogate, Selby and Craven. With close to 3 million people, a resident workforce of 1.4 million, over 100,000 businesses and an economy worth ¬£55 billion in 2012. The region is diverse and has many centres, both geographically and culturally. It is one of eight city regions defined in the 2004 document Moving Forward: The Northern Way, a collaboration between the three northern regional development agencies which is a part of the 20 year government strategy to grow the economy of Northern England. As a partnership, the Leeds City Region is firmly established and has in operation an accountable decision making structure, which involves the Leaders of all eleven partner authorities. It has made several successful bids for government funded economic development projects.  Geography  The local authority areas included in the Leeds City Region The region includes the whole of West Yorkshire and parts of South Yorkshire and North Yorkshire. The geographical area included in the city region is made up of the local authority areas of: *West Yorkshire, comprising Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds, Wakefield *from South Yorkshire, Barnsley *from North Yorkshire, Craven, Harrogate, Selby, York It covers a wide and varied physical region, taking in much of the Yorkshire Dales National Park as well as Nidderdale. Of the five cities, Leeds is the largest in geographical area, population and economy. The southern part of the region is largely urban with many former industrial centres. The northern part is mainly rural but includes significant urban centres, notably Harrogate and York. The northern areas are generally wealthier than the southern part of the city region. Barnsley is also part of the Sheffield City Region.  Transport  Leeds Bradford Airport The city region is served directly by Leeds Bradford Airport, although Manchester Airport is easily accessed by train and road from parts of the City Region, while Doncaster, Teesside and Humberside airports are also easily accessible. The Humber ports are also within easy reach. The north-south A1(M) and east-west M62 motorways intersect close to Leeds, near the terminus of the M1 from London. A series of motorway spurs enable traffic to reach the centres of Leeds and Bradford quickly. There is a comprehensive secondary road network based on Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and York. The A1, A64 and A650 are important trunk routes. Leeds railway station York railway station Harrogate railway station Leeds railway station is the hub of the region's extensive commuter rail network. The primary link to London is the East Coast Main Line, which principally serves Leeds, Wakefield Westgate and York. There are regional semi-fast services on the Trans-Pennine line that serve Huddersfield, Dewsbury, Leeds, Garforth, York and Northallerton. West Yorkshire Metro, coordinates rail services in the West Yorkshire part of this area, but not in Craven and Harrogate which are under the auspices of North Yorkshire County Council. Despite this, the regional transport network is strained thanks to low levels of transport investment from Central Government. As a result, there is overcrowding on the rail network and significant connectivity issues within the city region and between other city regions such as Manchester and Sheffield as well as London. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal and Aire and Calder Navigation run through the region, though today they are only used for leisure purposes.  Economy  The city region has a diverse economy consisting of around 100,000 businesses, generating around ¬£52 billion a year and is becoming recognised as a national centre for financial and business services. Leeds is at the economic heart, with some 124,000 people engaged in financial services. The city is the UK's second largest financial and legal centre. There is a large conference industry in Harrogate where the UK's third largest integrated conference and exhibition centre, Harrogate International Centre, is located. Rural areas have diversified with a mixed economy combining a range of employment opportunities alongside agriculture and a strong tourism base. Regardless of this, poor physical connectivity has hampered growth in rural areas. Agriculture has declined and there are pockets of severe deprivation and social exclusion. There are problems of housing affordability and poor access to services. Although like most of the UK manufacturing has declined, the city region retains role in the UK's manufacturing base which has emerged from a period of restructuring and moved into producing higher value goods, managing off-shored elements of production and concentrating on research and development activity. The south and west of the region have historically had industrial based economies, although they have been moving away from this in recent decades. Huddersfield, for example, has been developing in the creative industries sector.http://www.investinhuddersfield.co.uk/creative2.htm = Economic drivers and innovation = ;City region growth sectors include: ‚Ä¢ Financial and business services ‚Ä¢ Electronics and optical ‚Ä¢ Communications ‚Ä¢ Health and public services ;Niche clusters are: ‚Ä¢ Digital and media ‚Ä¢ Bioscience and medical research ‚Ä¢ Advanced niche manufacturing, including defence ‚Ä¢ Logistics and distribution ;Tourism Yorkshire is a popular tourist destination with many tourists using Leeds, Skipton, Bradford, Harrogate and York as bases to explore the Yorkshire Dales National Park.In 2007 the visitor economy contributed ¬£6.3bn or 8.5% of the Yorkshire and the Humber region's total output - a high proportion compared to the national average. This output has grown by 50% in the last 10 years. The sector employs 243,500 people, of which 51% work full-time, in over 20,000 businesses. There are two World Heritage Sites; Fountains Abbey (Ripon) and Saltaire (Bradford). Four national museums are based in the region; the National Media Museum (Bradford), the Royal Armouries in Leeds, the National Railway Museum in York, and the National Coal Mining Museum for England (Overton). Plus many other smaller museums depicting the industrial, agricultural and cultural history of the region, such as the Armley Mills Industrial Museum in Leeds, the Bankfield Textile Museum in Halifax, the Bront√´ Parsonage Museum in Haworth and the Yorkshire Museum of Farming at Murton Park in York. = Skills and labour = There is a large and diverse workforce of around 1.4 million and a younger than average profile in some parts of the city region, for example Bradford. The city region is home to six universities, University of Bradford, University of Huddersfield, University of Leeds, Leeds Beckett University, University of York and York St John University, which produce more than 40,000 graduates each year. The universities of Leeds and York, along with Sheffield, form the White Rose Consortium, which accounts for 86% of research spend in the region. Science City YorkScience city York Website home page represents a mechanism for creating an environment in which technology, skills and business can thrive together. The city region has been at the forefront of telecoms. Parts of the city region experience skills shortages, particularly in key growth sectors and clusters. There are also significant problems of low basic skills levels, which are quite acute within some disadvantaged communities. In parts of the city region, educational performance remains lower than the national average. The city region's labour market functions below its optimum. It has a higher than average level of worklessness, especially in inner urban and isolated rural areas. Although the region's universities‚Äô investment in R&D; equals the UK average, this is not mirrored in Government investment nor by regional business and industry, which is lower than half the UK average. Productivity rates are generally low, and large parts of the city region have lower than average rates of business formation, business growth and self-employment. = Business infrastructure = There is a range of available employment space with a significant amount of new office space in Leeds, however whilst there is a large supply of land available the sites are not necessarily suitable in both nature and location for key sectors and growth clusters. Some rural areas face shortages in employment land as a result of pressures for housing. The office market does not operate smoothly across the city region, with areas of extreme high and low demand. = Housing = There is variety of distinctive urban and rural communities. Many towns and villages are characterised by distinctive buildings based on an extensive Victorian legacy near to thriving job markets and commercial centres. Access to rural environments ranges from the ‚Äòhigh end‚Äô appeal of the Golden Triangle area of north Leeds, Harrogate and York districts to the towns and villages east and south of Leeds. Leeds is a centre for city centre living and has helped to stimulate similar developments in other urban centres including Bradford, Huddersfield and Wakefield. The current housing in the city region is inadequate to support the job growth. Current patterns of demand at the upper end of the market are likely to continue, increasing problems of division of social groups and affordability. At the other end of the market there are problems both with the shortage of social rented housing and affordability. There is a significant legacy of dense terraced housing some of which is no longer fit for purpose. The government has identified Leeds City Region to host a number of new eco- towns to meet housing demand. = Quality of life = Although the city region offers a unique set of attractions, and serves as a destination for millions of visitors a year, there is no distinct Leeds City Region popular identity, and there is no certainty as to whether such an identity would be desirable, whether for marketing or for other purposes.  Political context  The invitation to the northern regional development agencies to devise a development plan to tackle the regional disparities coincided with the peak of New Labour's regional devolution agenda. It is underpinned by the government's target to \\"Make sustainable improvements to the economic performance of all English regions by 2008 and over the long term reduce the persistent gap in growth rates between the regions, demonstrating progress by 2006.\\" = The Northern Way = In February 2004 the UK government invited the three regional development agencies in the North of England, Yorkshire Forward, One NorthEast and the Northwest Development Agency, to develop an economic growth strategy to raise the North's international profile and performance and reduce the ¬£30 billion output gap between the Northern region and the average for the rest of England. In September 2004 the development agencies published \\"Moving Forward: The Northern Way (First Growth Strategy Report)\\". The Growth Strategy shows how eight city regions are key to the growth of the northern economy. city regions are increasingly being recognised as powerful drivers for economic growth and between them the city regions of Leeds, Sheffield, Hull and the Humber Ports, Liverpool, Manchester, Central Lancashire, Tees Valley and Tyne and Wear have 90% of the North's population and over 90% of its economic activity. Manchester and Leeds were highlighted as the two city regions that have the most potential to develop into European level competitive cities. A ¬£100 million Northern Way Growth Fund was established by the Government and the regional development agencies to deliver a Business Plan, that had been devised in June 2005, aimed at implementing aspects of the Growth Strategy. As part of this plan the eight city regions identified in the strategy were invited to compile City Region Development Programmes to contribute to the plan. These set out the key actions and investments needed to implement the strategy in each city region. = Core cities = For more than ten years Leeds has been a member of the Core Cities Group, a coalition of England's major regional cities which work in partnership to enhance their economic performances, and to secure positive identities as places to live, work, visit and do business. It is a self-selected and self-funded group. The Core Cities Group has eight main interests, namely: *Transport and connectivity *Innovation and business support *Skills and employment *Sustainable communities *Culture and creative industries *Climate change *Finance and industry *Governance  Collaboration  The first economic summit, with the aim of discussing opportunities for greater collaboration within the Leeds city region, was in November 2004. Political leaders from Leeds, Barnsley, Bradford, Calderdale, Craven, Harrogate, Kirklees, Selby, Wakefield and York along with North Yorkshire, as well as representatives from other regional organisations took part. Delegates heard from speakers who presented the latest research on city regions as economic drivers. The need to engage in closer partnership and work at the city region level was recognised because it was emphasised that neither the city, or the larger region, is an appropriate spatial planning level at which to tackle issues of economic competitiveness. Delegates to the conference concluded that greater collaborative working would be beneficial in the areas of transportation, innovation and science, skills and labour supply, business infrastructure and housing, quality of life, culture, marketing and image. Leaders and chief executives of the eleven authorities agreed that this was an agenda to be developed and also agreed to produce a concordat to progress closer working arrangements at a city region level.  Development plans  The working arrangements negotiated at the economic summit held in November 2004 were used to develop an interim Leeds City Region Development Plan to be submitted as part of \\"The Northern Way\\" Business Plan in May 2005. The second version of the development plan was published in November 2008. Within the context of wider submissions to the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 made by the Northern Way Steering Group and Yorkshire Forward, the plan identified what the Leeds City Region is asking from government. It put forward a shortlist of evidenced strategic proposals and interventions that needed government support.  Core Cities business plan  At the end of 2005, as part of the \\"New Deal for City Regions\\" initiative the Minister of Communities and Local Government asked each of the Core Cities to produce a business plan of a small number of key priorities that would help cities improve. A delegation from Leeds and the region presented the \\"Leeds Business Case\\" to the minister in summer 2006. The submission argued that the city would benefit from greater freedom to make decisions locally and should have a greater voice in how national and regional budgets are allocated. In particular, transport and skills development were presented as critical issues for the economy of the city.  Sub national review  In the summer of 2007 the government published the \\"Review of Sub-national Economic Development and Regeneration\\". This sets out the governments strategy for reducing the gap in economic performance between Northern cities and their counterparts in the South, as well as the wealth gap within cities. The recognition by government that local and sub-regional authorities are in the strongest position to nurture and develop economic prosperity signalled the beginning of a new economic role for both the city and the Leeds City Region Partnership. As part of the new arrangements regional assemblies were phased out from 2010 and the remit of the regional development agencies was expanded. In particular, the regional development agencies were given executive responsibility for developing a new Integrated Regional Strategy. The scrutiny powers of the Regional Assemblies will transfer to local authorities. The stated aim of the policies being to create economically strong cities and regions which drive forward national prosperity and provide opportunity and social justice for all.  Partnership  The partnership has no direct political control of the cities and boroughs included in its area, but it does exert considerable influence over their local plans thanks to the Multi Area Agreement signed in July 2008. The partnership deals with issues that are important for the whole city region, yet which cannot be fully covered by one local government area alone, for example transport infrastructure and marketing the north of England to the world. The strategy provides the region with a single voice with which to address Central Government on key issues. In November 2006 the partnership published its revised development programme. = Constitution = Leaders Board The Leeds City Region Leaders Board was legally constituted as a Joint Committee in April 2007. It brings together the elected leaders of the eleven partner authorities to take strategic decisions on behalf of the city region. The Leaders‚Äô Board is made up of the Leaders of each of the 10 district Authorities, as well as North Yorkshire County Council. It is governed by a set of annually agreed Procedures and Protocols, central to which is the principle of ‚Äòone member, one vote‚Äô. The Board meets 6 times a year and meetings are hosted in turn by each member Authority. Leeds City Region Leaders‚Äô Board Panels are Working Groups set up by the Board to advise the Board on specific Leeds City Region matters. They comprise members of the Board or their representatives, and other such senior representatives of other organisations as may be co-opted onto the Panels by agreement of the Board. The Panels have no executive powers. The partnership has four panels which are involved in helping to develop strategies to improve:- *Housing and Spatial Planning *Skills *Transport *Economic Drivers and Innovation Areas of work not specifically allocated to a single panel are:- *Communications *Sustainable Development  Multi area agreement  In October 2007 the Leeds City Region Leaders Board decided to seek to develop a Multi Area Agreement which is a voluntary agreement between groups of local authorities and government which focuses on cross boundary working and devolution as a means of promoting an increase in local economic prosperity. The Leeds City region was in the first wave of pilot areas for a Multi Area Agreement and the partners used the opportunity to implement areas of the City Region Development Programme.  Forerunner plan  In March 2009 Leeds City Region Partnership submitted a formal bid for more powers and funding from Government through a pilot programme on offer. The Partnership put forward a \\"Forerunner Plan\\" with proposals for greater responsibilities in housing and regeneration, higher level skills and innovation. The bid was the Partnership's formal response to the announcement by HM Treasury in the November 2008 Pre-Budget Report that Government would be working with at least two city region partnerships across the country to pilot new freedoms and flexibilities in a range of areas. These arrangements will see the Government and its agencies delegating greater control over funding and delivery of key schemes to the city region authorities as a way of stimulating economic growth. The Partnership has proposed that with the new powers and funding, the city region authorities will be able to more effectively deliver the short and long-term actions needed to get markets working again. In April 2009 the partnership joined the Manchester City Region as one of the only two city regions in the country to be granted this pilot status as announced by the Chancellor Alistair Darling in his Budget speech. This will grant the partnership devolved spending powers in housing, regeneration, skills and innovation.  Eco towns and new growth points  The Leeds City Region was invited by the government to submit proposals for new eco-towns. However, the City Region Partnership has considered the case for a free-standing eco town and concluded that it would not offer the most appropriate, sustainable way forward for meeting the city region's housing and affordable housing needs. After a study of the city region the Stockholm Environment Unit found the best way of reducing its carbon footprint by 80% by 2050 involved working within existing settlements and changing behaviour. The partnership considers that the city region's housing and regeneration needs can be better served by delivering eco principles on a number of major regeneration sites within existing urban environments. The partnership has proposed to Government four major brownfield regeneration sites as alternatives to an eco town in the city region. The proposed sites are: *Aire Valley Leeds. A 1000-hectare site to the south east of the city centre. Up to 15,000 new homes, 7,000 refurbishments and 27,000 jobs. *Bradford-Shipley Canal Corridor. Area of 118-hectares along five-mile stretch. Up to 5,000 new homes, 1,500 refurbishments and 5,900 jobs. *York Northwest. On brown-field to the north and west of the station. Will deliver 4,300 new homes on 75-hectares of land and 5,000 jobs. *North Kirklees / South Dewsbury Up to 4,000 new homes, 2,000 refurbishments and 5,000 jobs spread over four sites, Thornhill Lees, Savile Town, Ravensthorpe and Scout Hill. Building work is only ready to start on one site, the Aire Valley scheme to the south east of Leeds city centre. The 1,000-hectare site has the potential to provide up to 15,000 eco homes, retrofit 7,000 existing homes and create 27,000 new jobs. Phase one will concentrate on the Hunslet Riverside area next to the Royal Armouries museum, where 2,500 new homes can be built. New trolleybuses and cycle paths will make travel to and from the area environmentally sustainable and cars will be discouraged. Housing Minister, and Wentworth MP, John Healey announced in July 2009 that Yorkshire will receive ¬£83m through the Homes and Communities Agency Kickstart programme, designed to fund housing schemes that had stalled in the recession, enough to build 2,088 homes. The City Region made a successful bid for \\"New Growth Point\\" status in July 2008. The programme of New Growth Point developments supports delivery of 5000 additional new homes above regional housing targets. It is focussed within the district of Barnsley Calderdale and Wakefield across a range of tenures and including a variety of affordable homes for rent and owner occupation. The programme proposes 34,515 new homes, 5000 of which will be net additional over the period 2008 to 2016/17.  Integrated infrastructure  As a step towards developing an evidence base to support the co-production of the Integrated Regional Strategy (IRS) promulgated by the \\"Sub National Review of Economic Development and Regeneration\\", the city region has commenced a study to investigate whether current infrastructure arrangements will support the economic aspirations of the city region. The study aims identify the types of infrastructure improvements that will be needed to support growth. It will look at critical infrastructure and green infrastructure. For critical infrastructure, planners need to be confident that new developments have access to water, energy, waste treatment and broadband technology as well as ensuring that this infrastructure will be adaptable to climate change. Green infrastructure is a relatively new term describing networks of linked green spaces. Work at the city region level will identify opportunities for linking the green spaces between districts, which will have direct benefits for public accessibility, biodiversity and eco- systems that have a positive benefit in terms of climate change adaptation.  Integrated Transport Authority  After the publication of the draft Local Transport Bill in May 2007 the Partnership commissioned a review of transport governance arrangements in the region. Leeds City Region has stated that it is an aspiration for the City Region to become an Integrated Transport Authority, but with opposition to this from North Yorkshire County Council and the City of York council, these proposals cannot go ahead at this stage. = Local transport plan = The West Yorkshire rail network The partnership is overseeing the investment of ¬£4.5 billion in transport projects in the region. The ¬£4.5bn is being sourced from a number of locations, notably the Department for Transport and the regional transport board at Yorkshire Forward. Some of the money has already been spent through projects such as the regional smartcard pilot Yorcard, whereas other projects like NGT (New Generation Transport) in Leeds has recently been approved for government funding in 2012. Significant progress has been made, in conjunction with Metro, to extend the zonal WYPTE MetroCard system into North Yorkshire as far as Harrogate on the Harrogate Line (Zone 6) and Skipton on the Airedale Line (Zone 7). Future plans will extend MetroCard to Gargrave, Knaresborough, York and Selby. Zone 6 & 7 MetroCards do not currently cover bus travel.  Enterprise zone  The Leeds City Region Enterprise Zone, sometimes referred to as Aire Valley Leeds Enterprise Zone, was launched in April 2012. It includes four sites along the A63 East Leeds Link Road: Logic Leeds, Newmarket Lane, Thornes Farm, and the largest site, Temple Green. The total area is .

Life Turner was born at Reading, Berkshire in 1591, the son of Thomas Turner of Heckfield in Hampshire, mayor of Reading. He matriculated at St. John's College, Oxford, on 26 June 1610, graduating B.A. on 6 June 1614 and M.A. on 9 May 1618. He was elected a fellow, took the degree of B.D. on 20 July 1624, and was created D.D. on 1 April 1633. In 1623 he was presented by his college to the vicarage of St Giles' Church, Oxford, which he held with his fellowship, but relinquished in 1629. William Laud, when Bishop of London, made him his chaplain. On 7 January 1628 Turner was appointed a member of the commission for ecclesiastical causes; and on 14 April 1629 Laud collated him to the prebend of Newington in St. Paul's Cathedral. On 29 October following he was collated chancellor of London, and soon after was appointed chaplain in ordinary to the king. He was briefly rector of St Mary's, Ashwell. In May 1631 he obtained the rectory of St. Augustine-in-the-Gate, but exchanged it on 10 November for that of Southwark. In 1633 he accompanied Charles I in his Scottish coronation progress, and on 17 December of the same year his name appears in the commission for exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction in England and Wales. On 11 November 1634 he was instituted rector of Fecham in Surrey; on 31 December 1638 he and John Juxon received from the king the lease of the prebend and rectory of Aylesbury for five years; and 16 February 1642 he was nominated Dean of Rochester. On 3 January 1644 he was constituted Dean of Canterbury, in name only since Kent was in the hands of Parliament. He adhered to the king with great devotion, and attended him at Hampton Court and during his imprisonment in the Isle of Wight. During the parliamentary ascendency and in the time of the Commonwealth he was harassed and deprived of his benefices. Three of his houses were plundered, his books seized, and he himself arrested at Fecham by a party of horse for having sent money to the king. He was dragged away while holding divine service and carried to the White Lion Prison in Southwark. At the Restoration he regained his Surrey rectories, and entered into possession of the deanery of Canterbury. Shortly after he resigned the rectory of Fecham. Dying on 8 October 1672, he was buried in the Dean's Chapel in Canterbury Cathedral, where a mural monument was erected to his memory. Family He married Margaret, daughter of Sir Francis Windebank. By her he had three sons: Francis Turner; Thomas Turner (1645‚Äì1714), president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford; and William Turner (1647‚Äì1685), Archdeacon of Northumberland.

He was the first Bishop of Natchitoches, Louisiana (1853‚Äì1875). Biography Martin was born in Saint- Malo, Brittany, and studied under Jean-Marie de Lamennais. As a seminarian, he was employed at the Grand Almonry of France in Paris under Cardinal Gustave Maximilien Juste de Cro√ø-Solre. He was ordained to the priesthood in September, 1825. He served as pastor in Bleurais and Vern before being assigned as chaplain of the Royal College of Rennes where he served until 1839, when he accepted an invitation from Bishop C√©lestine Guynemer de la Hailandi√®re to join the Diocese of Vincennes in Indiana. After arriving in the United States, Martin served as pastor of St. Vincent's Church in Logansport and the Vincennes Cathedral (1839‚Äì1843) and as vicar general of the diocese (1843‚Äì1846), in addition to engaging in the missions of Indiana. During this time he became a confidant of Saint Mother Theodore Guerin, who founded the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods in the diocese in 1840. The two corresponded often, exchanging letters back and forth. Although it has been reported that Fr. Martin left the Diocese of Vincennes due to failing health, it was in fact due to the problems created by the Bishop of Vincennes, Celestine Guynemer de la Hailandiere. Fr. Martin had been recruited by Hailandiere but because of Hailandiere's insistence on total control, many priests left the diocese. He then went to Louisiana, where he appointed to St. Martin's Church at Attakapas. In 1847 he became pastor of St. Joseph's in Baton Rouge, St. John's at the Plains, and St. Magdalen's in Manchac, and was transferred to St. Francis of Assisi Church in Natchitoches in 1849. He was made vicar forane of north Louisiana under Archbishop Blanc in 1850. On July 29, 1853, Martin was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Natchitoches by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 30 from Archbishop Antoine Blanc, with Bishops Michael Portier and James Oliver Van de Velde, S.J., serving as co-consecrators, at the St. Louis Cathedral. During his 22-year-long tenure, he recruited priests and religious from Europe for the diocese, established a seminary to train native clergy, founded numerous missions, and erected a cathedral. He guided the diocese during the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), and attended the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore (1866) and First Vatican Council (1869‚Äì1870).

It is the replacement generic name for Alligatorium depereti, which was described in 1915 from the Montsec Lithographic Limestone quarry of Spain. Fossils found from this locality are from the Early Cretaceous, being Upper Berriasian-Lower Valanginian in age, belonging to the La Pedrera de R√∫bies Formation While many publications concerning atoposaurids after 1915 have included mentions of A. depereti, none has offered a redescription or revision of the species, though some recognized that great differences existed between it and other members of the genus. In these publications, the skull of A. depereti was shorter in relation to body length than any other species of Alligatorium (being less than half of the presacral length), and this may have been evidence for the genetic distinction of the species, although no replacement name was proposed. However, better preparation of the holotype specimen MGB 512, a nearly complete articulated skeleton embedded in a limestone matrix now housed in the Museu de Ci√®ncies Naturals de Barcelona, allowed for a revision of the species in 1990 in which the name Montsecosuchus was first used. Holotipe of Montsecosuchus genus Montsecosuchus differs in several ways from other atoposaurids such as Alligatorium, Alligatorellus, and Theriosuchus. Several characteristics of the skull including the presence of an ungrooved parietal- squamosal suture and a caudally projecting retroarticular process distinguish Montsecosuchus from these genera. Both Montsecosuchus and Alligatorellus possess three sacral vertebrae; this may be a shared synapomorphy of the two genera. The shortness of the radius is an autapomorphy of the genus that is not seen in any other atoposaurid, although it is common in more derived crocodylomorphs.

Origins The brothers' father, Theodore, was born on January 20, 1850, in a small town in Germany called Kirsch, near Trier, Alsace-Lorraine, which was the border region between Germany and France. \\"Their father, Theodore Nesser, was lured from Germany by the railroad and designed the steam engine the Pennsy used for years\\" He eventually got a job with the German railroad as an apprentice boilermaker. Soon afterwards the German government, which operated and controlled all the railroads, sent him to Metz, where he worked for twelve years as a boilermaker. \\"The Man Who Built the National Football League: Joe F. Carr\\" In 1870, at the age of 20, he fought with the German army in the Franco-Prussian War although he did not care for the fighting. (He lost part of his left hand ring finger when he was shot in the war). After the war, around 1873, Theodore met Katerina Steinbach (born Feb 22, 1854 in Baden, Germany), and the following year the two were married and wasted no time in creating a large family. the couple eventually had 12 children: 1\\\\. John Nesser: Born April 25, 1875 in Triere, Germany and died August 1, 1931, in Columbus, Ohio. 2\\\\. Anna Kathryn Nesser: b.

Frederick William Nesser: b. September 10, 1887 in Columbus, Ohio, and died July 2, 1967, in Columbus, Ohio. 9\\\\. Francis Raymond (Frank) Nesser: b. June 3, 1889 in Columbus, Ohio, and died January 1, 1953, in Columbus, Ohio. 10\\\\. Mary Rose Nesser: b. May 7, 1891 in Columbus, Ohio, and died December 17, 1959, in Columbus, Ohio. 11\\\\.

March 22, 1898 in Columbus, Ohio, and died September 2, 1969, in Columbus, Ohio. The railroad sent Theodore to Dennison, Ohio, to start working. By 1882 he had finally saved enough money for Katerina and the five children to make their way to America. He eventually designed the steam engine that would be used by the railroad the years to come. However, when the railroad tweaked his design to get around his patent in 1887, Nesser quit and started a plumbing business in Columbus. Pennsylvania Railroad Seven of the eight Nesser boys eventually followed their father to work as boilermakers at the Pennsylvania Railroad. The brothers did backbreaking, muscle-straining work for 10 hours a day at the shops of the Panhandle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. However, they always rushed through their 1-hour lunch break so they could practice football for 50 minutes before they returned to work. In the event of rain, they played euchre. None of the brothers attended college, however, they were offered various scholarships. One brother, Frank, was offered a chance to go to Notre Dame but chose to get married instead. Meanwhile, Phil was a math genius who never had any formal education beyond the fourth grade. Ted was a football genius and is credited with originating several plays: the triple-pass, the criss-cross, and the short kickoff, which became popular plays at the college level. Columbus Panhandles In 1907, Joe Carr resurrected and reorganized the Columbus Panhandles, a professional football team that recorded its first season in 1901 but disbanded in 1904 due to financial hardships. With his experience as a sportswriter and a sports executive in baseball, he was ready to make his mark on football, the sport he truly loved. However, if his team was to succeed, he needed an attraction. That led Carr to build his team around pro football's most famous family, the Nesser brothers. Eventually six brothers would play for the Panhandles. Carr used the Nesser brothers as the backbone of the Panhandles, and the football-playing family remained in that role for nearly twenty years. Because most of the team's players were employed by the railroad, they could ride the train free of charge. Because of this perk, Carr was able to schedule mostly road games, eliminating the expenses of stadium rental, game promotion, and security for the field. This perk combined combination with the Nesser brothers, made the Panhandles a major attraction in the early days of professional football. The Nesser brothers were bigger and stronger than most of their opponents. In their prime, they averaged more than 210 pounds apiece, in an era in which the average professional lineman weighed about 180 pounds. The Nessers were a huge draw everywhere they went. During a game against the Detroit Heralds in Navin Field (later renamed Tiger Stadium) in 1916 the team drew 7,000 spectators, even though the Heralds hiked their ticket prices from $1 to $1.50 only for games against the Panhandles and Jim Thorpe's Canton Bulldogs. The brothers were written up extensively in out- of-town newspapers, but barely received notice in their hometown of Columbus. This fact is due to the focus of Columbus fans on the Ohio State University football team. They had little interest in games played by railroad workers. As a consequence, the Panhandles never achieved much of a hometown following. Ted's son Charlie also played briefly for the Panhandles in 1921. At the time Ted was a player-coach for the team. This led to the only time in NFL history where a father and son played together on the same team. The 1921 Panhandles team reported featured six Nesser brothers, a son (Charlie Nesser), a nephew (Ted Hopkins) and a brother-in-law (John Schneider) on the team. Four of the brothers retired as players after the 1921 season, including 46-year-old John, who held the record as the NFL's oldest player until it was later broken by George Blanda. Meanwhile, Al continue to play until 1931. Outside football There were 12 children in the Nesser family. Ironically the only boy who didn't play football was Pete, the largest of the Nesser brothers, who weigh in at 350 pounds. The game just did not appeal to him. He worked as a boilermaker for the Pennsylvania Railroad for a remarkable 57 years, starting in 1890 at age 13, and continuing until his retirement in 1947. Pete died on May 29, 1954, at the age of 76. Meanwhile, the football career of Raymond, the youngest of the brothers, remains somewhat of a mystery. It seems he only played in few games with his brothers, but he did appear in photos advertising the Panhandles. He didn't follow his brothers into the boilermaker trade, either; instead he became a police officer for the city of Columbus. Raymond died on September 2, 1969, at the age of 71. Other teams The Nessers also played for a little for the Massillon Tigers, Akron Indians, Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Shelby Blues, Cleveland Panthers and the New York Giants. Ted, the first Nesser to make money at football, played for Massillon's state championship team in 1904, 1905 and 1906. Older brother John also played for the Tigers, in 1905, before Carr formed the Panhandles in 1907. Meanwhile, Al won two NFL Championships with the Akron Pros (1920) and the New York Giants (1927). Frank was usually recruited by Peggy Parratt to play for his Akron Indians. Other sports The Nessers were not restricted to playing only football. In addition to football Phil was a champion hammer thrower. Meanwhile, Fred was a professional boxer who was considered a legitimate contender for the heavyweight title, held by Jess Willard. However, in 1915, a broken wrist ended his boxing career. Frank was also a star baseball player who never ranked below third in batting in the Ohio State League and the Southern Association during his six years as a pro. Recognition Columbus has no plaques or monuments to the Nessers or a street named after them. In 1987, Fred's daughter Vera tried to get the city to name a street after the football pioneering brothers, however her request was rejected. A display recognizing the Nessers' contributions to pro football is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, although none of the brothers have been formally inducted into the Hall.

In the United States, this also refers to creating laws that set cutoff dates slightly before New Year's in order to redshirt kids born in the later part of the calendar year (often September to December) for the same purposes. This occurs most frequently where children's birthdays are so close to the cut-off dates that they are very likely to be among the youngest in their kindergarten class. Etymology Redshirting originated as a term for a similar activity but occurring in college sports rather than kindergarten, where a redshirt (noun) was \\"a high-school or college athlete kept out of varsity competition for one year to develop skills and extend eligibility\\" and originated \\"from the red shirts worn in practice by such athletes\\". The term is an Americanism from circa 1950‚Äì1955. Incidence of redshirting The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reports that academic redshirting occurs at the rate of about 9% per year among kindergarten-age children. The change has been even larger in first grade: over a period of forty years, the proportion of six-year-olds in first grade went from 96% to 84%.Stephanie Pappas, \\"More Parents 'Redshirting' Kindergartners\\", Live Science, 5 September 2010 Redshirting has traditionally been more common in affluent communities and for children attending private schools, although some scholars speculate that there may have been a recent increase in certain public school districts. According to NCES, boys are more likely to be redshirted than girls, and children born in the latter third of the year (September to December) are five times more likely to be redshirted than those born in the earlier months of the year. The NCES report also shows that white, non-Hispanic children are more than twice as likely as black, non- Hispanic children to have entered kindergarten later than their birthdays allowed. Redshirting may be a response to demands for a higher level of school readiness. In a national survey, teachers indicated that 48% of their students were not ready for the current kindergarten curriculum. High percentages of teachers indicated that half of their students lacked important skills, including \\"following directions\\" (46%), \\"academic skills\\" (36%), and the ability to \\"work independently\\" (34%). In light of such data, many scholars suggest that academic curricula are not appropriate for young children. Effects Research on redshirting suggests that while some advantages may accrue in the short term, these advantages dissipate by the end of elementary school, and may be replaced by deleterious effects in the long term. Some studies have examined the effects of redshirting that occur immediately or within the early elementary years. Others have examined its long-term effects. Proponents and opponents of redshirting often use the same evidence but reach opposite conclusions.Winnie Hu, \\"Too Young for Kindergarten? Tide Turning against 4-Year-olds\\", The New York Times, 27 May 2011. A recent survey of evidence indicates that academic advantages accrue to students who are young for their year, the converse of redshirting.Sam Wang (neuroscientist) and Sandra Aamodt, \\"Delay Kindergarten At Your Child's Peril\\", The New York Times, 24 September 2011. This conclusion continues to be validated in more recent analyses. It is therefore unclear whether redshirting solves problems of school readiness. =Immediate effects= Research on academic redshirting suggests that, in the short term, redshirting (1) raises the child's academic achievement (math, reading, general knowledge) and conduct on par with or above that of younger classmates; (2) increases the child's confidence in social interactions and popularity among classmates; and (3) may simply add to the normal mix of ages and abilities within the classroom. However, there is also some speculation that, in classes where there are children who have been redshirted, some older children may feel alienated from their younger classmates, and some older classmates may have an unfair advantage over younger classmates in size and psychomotor and social skills. The presence of children of a wider age span may also make the class too diverse for a teacher to manage well. =Effects in grades 1‚Äì3= Researchers have observed other effects of redshirting within the first three years of elementary school, including (1) academic achievement that is nearly equal to that of their grade-level peers, (2) a lower likelihood of receiving \\"negative feedback from teachers about their academic performance or conduct in class\\", and (3) less need for special education than classmates who were retained as kindergartners. However, there is also evidence that some first through third- graders who were redshirted as children required greater use of special education services than their non-redshirted and non-retained classmates. =Long-term effects= Proponents of redshirting often assert that there is no definitive evidence to show that redshirting harms children in the long term. Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers is cited to show that the strongest youngsters are older,Suzanne Collier, citing Gladwell, in Pamela Paul, \\"The Littlest Redshirts Sit Out Kindergarten\\", The New York Times, 20 August 2010. but much of the evidence cited there pertains specifically to men's ice hockey, an intensively competitive contact sport that depends on physical size. Such an old-for-year advantage is not seen for many other sports, and appears to depend on intensive coaching attention to larger players in early childhood. The advantage to hockey players appears to arise from increased opportunities. In the academic arena, advantages are seen not for older students, but for those who are young for their year. In a large-scale study at 26 Canadian elementary schools, first graders who were young for their year made considerably more progress in reading and math than kindergartners who were old for their year (but just two months younger). In another large study, the youngest fifth-graders scored a little lower than their classmates, but five points higher in verbal I.Q., on average, than fourth-graders of the same age. These studies are consistent with the idea that the source of increased opportunity in this case is school itself, with effects that are more favorable to students who are surrounded by children who are older than themselves. One 1997 study found that adolescents whose school entry had been delayed exhibited more behavioral problems than their classmates. Moreover, in light of evidence of a higher use of special education services by redshirted youths, it has been speculated that many individuals who were redshirted as kindergarteners may have had special needs that were misdiagnosed as immaturity and that should have been treated by some form of direct intervention other than delayed entry. Sam Wang and Sandra Aamodt focus on redshirting kindergartners in relation to sports, rather than parental appeals to emotional and academic maturity. \\"The practice, called redshirting‚Äîfrom the term for allowing college athletes to delay participation in sports to prolong their eligibility‚Äîalso has a connection to children‚Äôs sports. As sports-minded parents know, physical maturity allows older children to perform better. Coaches often mistake this difference for natural aptitude and respond by giving the older children on their T-ball or soccer teams more opportunities to improve their skills. And those athletes tend to gain a lasting competitive advantage.\\"Delay Kindergarten at Your Child‚Äôs Peril, NY Times, article by SAM WANG and SANDRA AAMODT.

His name is sometimes spelled \\"Swarup Kishan\\". He was born in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir. He played cricket as a wicketkeeper batsman at Delhi University. He became a lawyer, working in the Auditor-General's Office. He umpired in first-class cricket from 1969 to 1984, including the final of the Duleep Trophy in 1981/2 and of the Ranji Trophy in 1982/3. He also umpired in List A cricket, including the final of the Deodhar Trophy in 1980/1. He stood in 17 Test matches between 1978 and 1984, equalling the Indian record set by B. Satyaji Rao in 1979, but subsequently surpassed by VK Ramaswamy (26 matches between 1985 and 1999) and Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan (73 matches between 1993 and 2004). All of the Test matches he umpired were played in India. His bulky white-coated body and habit of chewing tobacco made him instantly recognisable. He first stood as a Test umpire in the 2nd Test between India and West Indies at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore in December 1978, with Mohammad Ghouse. He also stood in the 4th Test, at MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chepauk, Madras, in January 1979, with Jiban Ghosh. He also stood in the 1st and 5th Tests against Australia later in 1979, and the 1st, 4th and 5th Tests against Pakistan in 1979/80. The first day of the first India-Pakistan Test, also in Bangalore, was interrupted when a swarms of bees flew over the field, and the players and umpires threw themselves to the ground to escape. Controversy attended the final day of the rain-affected 1st Test against Pakistan in Bangalore in September 1983. A minimum of 77 overs were due to be bowled, but Kishen and Madhav Gothoskar informed Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas that all 20 of the overs due when the final hour of play started had to be completed. However, Zaheer Abbas led his team off the field after the 14th over (the 77th over of the day) but was persuaded to return to allow Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar to reach his 28th Test century. India only lost two of the Tests he umpired, both against West India in 1983. He was standing at the other end at Bombay in November 1983 when Desmond Haynes was give out \\"handled the ball\\" - the fourth in Test history. His last Test, and also his last first-class match, as an umpire was played between India and England at Wankhede Stadium in Bombay in November 1984. He also stood in 6 One-day Internationals between 1981 and 1985, including 3 in Sharjah, and umpired one Women's Test, played between Australia and India at Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi in January 1984. He was awarded the Padma Shri for his services to cricket. He died in Delhi from cancer.

He is notable for questioning whether the Department of Justice and Department of Defense should rely on paid witnesses when trying to assemble a new case against his client, Mohammed Jawad. His work on the case was featured in the February 2011 issue of GQ magazine. Education Montalvo has a Bachelor of Science from the University of South Carolina and a Juris Doctor from Temple University School of Law. Legal career Montalvo is Founding Partner of The Federal Practice Group.http://www.fedpractice.com/> His areas of practice are military law, security clearance law, international corporate law, and white collar crime. =Guantanamo hitch= On July 22, 2009, US District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle granted Jawad's habeas corpus petition, ruling that all the evidence against him was inadmissible, because it was triggered by torture. The Department of Justice requested time to lay new charges against Jawad, based on witness statements that had not been available during the previous five years he had been in custody. On August 4, 2009, the Washington Independent reported that Montalvo and lead counsel David Frakt reported that the new prosecution witnesses had received gifts or cash in return for their testimony. On August 28, 2009, Jeremy Page, writing in The Times, reported that Montalvo was planning to represent Jawad in a lawsuit against the US government. Page reported that Montalvo was scheduled to retire from the Marine Corps within the next month. On September 21, 2009, historian Andy Worthington, author of The Guantanamo Files, published a letter from Montalvo's colleague Frakt, that explained Montalvo's role in more detail. He wrote that, initially, Jawad's Defense team was going to hire a private investigator to travel to Afghanistan to conduct their own investigation, because so much of the evidence in the case had disappeared. It was only when Susan Crawford declined to budget for a private investigator that Montalvo made plans to serve as the team's investigator. =Defense of Adam Winfield= Adam Winfield is a soldier who faces charges that he participated in a thrill kill murder ring in Afghanistan. Montalvo is serving as his attorney.

King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII), the older brother of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), bestowed on it the status of Royal temple of the first grade in 1935.  Location  Wat Phra Singh is located in the western part of the old city centre of Chiang Mai, which is contained within the city walls and moat. The main entrance is guarded by Singhs (lions). Wat Pra Singh is situated at the end of the main street (Rachadamnoen road) of Chiang Mai. The road runs east from the temple, via Tapae Gate, to the Ping River.  Name  Phra Singh is an abbreviated form of Phra-Put-Tha-Shi-Hing and does not refer to the word Singh (\\"lion\\").  Notability  The temple houses an important Buddha statue: the Phra Buddha Sihing which gives the temple its name. The origins of this statue are unknown but, according to legend, it was based on the lion of Shakya, a statue since lost which used to be housed in the Mahabodhi Temple of Bodh Gaya (India). The Phra Buddha Sihing statue is supposed to have been brought, via Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka), to Ligor (present day Nakhon Si Thammarat) and, from there, via Ayutthaya, to Chiang Mai. There are two more Buddha statues in Thailand which are claimed to be the Phra Buddha Sihing: one is housed in Wat Phra Mahathat in the city of Nakhon Si Thammarat and another one the Bangkok National Museum.Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co. Ltd., It is alleged that the head of the statue had been stolen in 1922. The possibility remains that the present statue (or maybe only the head) is a copy. Every year, during the Songkran festival, the statue is taken from wihan Lai Kham and carried through the streets of Chiang Mai in a religious procession during which the spectators honour the statue by sprinkling water over it.  History  Construction on Wat Phra Singh began in 1345 when King Phayu, the fifth king of the Mangrai dynasty, had a chedi built to house the ashes of his father King Kham Fu. A wihan and several other buildings were added a few years later and the resulting complex was named Wat Lichiang Phra. When, in 1367, the statue of Phra Buddha Singh was brought to the temple, the temple complex received its present name. During restoration works in 1925, three funerary urns were discovered inside a small chedi. It was assumed that these contained royal ashes. The urns have since been lost. From 1578 to 1774 the Burmese ruled Lanna and in this period the temple was abandoned and came under serious disrepair. It was only when King Kawila assumed the throne as King of Chiang Mai in 1782, that the temple was restored. King Kawila had the ubosot built and the chedi enlarged. Later successors restored the Wihan Lai Kham and the elegant Ho Trai (temple library). The whole temple complex underwent extensive renovations under the famous monk Khru Ba Srivichai during the 1920s. Many of the buildings were again restored in 2002.  Sights  Buddhist monks in the ubosot of Wat Phra Singh * Wihan Luang ‚Äì the original wihan was replaced by the present building in 1925. * Wihan Lai Kham ‚Äì this wihan is the main attraction of the complex. It was built in 1345 to house the Phra Buddha Singh statue and it is a prime example of classical Lanna architecture. The murals of the wihan are also highly remarkable. The murals on the left show the history of Songthong and on the right the history of Suwanna Hongse. * Ubosot ‚Äì built in 1806, it contains two entrances: a south entrance for monks and a north entrance for nuns. It is as such a song sangha ubosot ('song' meaning 'two' in Thai). The building houses a mondop with the Phrachaotongtip Buddha statue, a smaller version of the Phra Buddha Sihing and it is therefore also known as Phrasingha noi ('noi' meaning 'small' in Thai). The northern end of the wihan, near the entrance for the nuns, contains a copy of the Emerald Buddha. * Ho Trai ‚Äì the temple library is another prime example of classical Lanna architecture and it is one of the most beautiful temple libraries in Thailand. The guards, flanking the stairs, consist of lions emerging from the mouths of a Makara, a mythical water creature. This combination is rarely seen elsewhere. * The Phrathatluang ‚Äì each side of the square base of the main chedi of the complex features the front half of an elephant emerging from it. After it was built in 1345, the chedi was enlarged several times. * The Kulai chedi ‚Äì this small square based chedi, built as a pagoda with five tiered roofs by King Mueangkaeo (1495‚Äì1525), is connected to Wihan Lai Kham by a short tunnel which is not opened to visitors. When the chedi was restored under King Dharmalanka (1813‚Äì1822), a golden box containing ancient relics was found. After the works were completed, the box and its contents were placed once more inside the chedi.

An expanded recovery centre was opened by Sophie Christiansen in June 2013 and a new accident and emergency department opened on 3 April 2019. Services The hospital provides emergency, trauma and orthopaedic surgery, plastic and reconstructive surgery, paediatric, coronary care and maternity services, amongst others, in Wexham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom. It is an associate teaching hospital for the London and Oxford postgraduate medical and dental education organisations, receiving fully qualified nationally appointed trainees (foundation, GP, core and specialty) who are undertaking further postgraduate training in a variety of specialties. It is home to a renowned plastic surgery unit with a wealth of history. Founded by pioneering British plastic surgeon Stewart Harrison (who himself had been trained by Cambridge alumnus and world-renowned plastic surgeon Harold Gillies), on opening in 1966 it rapidly became known as a major UK centre for hand surgery and had the only accredited senior registrar post in hand surgery nationally. In 1949, Harrison and Gillies had performed a pioneering operation to reconstruct the face of a patient born with a congenitally recessed maxilla. This complex operation marked the beginnings of the speciality of craniofacial surgery. Among the observers was French plastic surgeon Paul Tessier, who went on to refine the technique for the treatment of severely deformed children. Harrison, a graduate of Glasgow University (MB ChB 1935), was a founding member of the British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH) and served as president of the society in 1972, and as president of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons (now British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS)) in 1976. Harrison died on 12 May 2011 aged 98.

The new company bought the line on July 29, and an SP-funded reconstruction was completed on September 1, 1906, when the line was opened to the public as a leased branch line of the SP. Extensions were completed to Bray on September 6, 1907, Dorris on May 1, 1908, the Oregon state line on August 25, 1908, Worden on November 25, 1908, Ady on January 1, 1909, and finally the whole to Klamath Falls, Oregon on May 20, 1909.Donald B. Robertson, Encyclopedia of Western Railroad History: Oregon, Washington, Caxton Printers, 1986, p. 107 On August 21, 1905, the Oregon Eastern Railway was incorporated in the interest of the SP and Union Pacific Railroad (UP), then both controlled by E. H. Harriman. This company surveyed a route from a line of SP lessor Oregon and California Railroad at Natron, near Springfield, over the Cascades in the direction of the UP near Ontario, Oregon. It also planned to build branches south to Klamath Falls and Lakeview, the former connecting with the California Northeastern. This company began construction in November 1909 on the line north from Klamath Falls, soon reaching Chiloquin under lease to the SP. The Oregon Eastern acquired the property of the California Northeastern on December 18, 1911, and on February 12, 1912, the property of the Oregon Eastern was sold to SP lessor Central Pacific Railway, which owned the main line through Weed. The Central Pacific completed two segments on which the Oregon Eastern had begun work: Natron to Oakridge and Chiloquin to Kirk, in May and September 1912 respectively. However, work was then placed on hold while the federal government decided whether the SP's lease of the CP violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. (It had already broken up the SP-UP combination in 1913.U.S. Supreme Court. U.S. v. Union Pacific Railroad Company, .) Pengra Pass. Built by SP in 1925. The Transportation Act of 1920 gave the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to approve combinations that would serve the public interest, and on February 10, 1923, the ICC approved the SP's continued control of the Central Pacific, which was backed by the Justice Department on June 11.John R. Signor, Rails in the shadow of Mt. Shasta, Howell-North Books, 1982, pp. 98-100, 110, 121 Construction resumed in October, and on September 1, 1926 the Natron Cutoff was completed. Finally, On April 17, 1927, a new line opened between Black Butte (south of Weed) and Grass Lake, replacing the cheaply built former logging line, and allowing the SP to inaugurate the all-Pullman Cascade between San Francisco and Portland over this route.Guy L. Dunscomb, A Century of Southern Pacific Steam Locomotives, 1862-1962, 1963, pp. 395, 467 As for the line into eastern Oregon, the Oregon Eastern sold its surveys and right-of-way to new UP subsidiary Oregon‚ÄìWashington Railroad and Navigation Company (OWR&N;) on December 23, 1910. Some of this property was acquired from the Boise and Western Railway, which had been incorporated on September 13, 1909 in the interest of Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway subsidiary Oregon Trunk Railway to build in the same area.John T. Gaertner, North Bank Road: the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway, Washington State University Press, 1991, p. 103 The OWR&N; subsequently built the Ontario‚ÄìBurns Branch on this alignment, branching from the former Malheur Valley Railway at Vale and eventually reaching Burns, which it leased to UP subsidiary Oregon Short Line Railroad for operation. All of the Cascade Line remains in service as part of the Union Pacific Railroad's I-5 corridor also served by Amtrak's Coast Starlight. The Ontario‚ÄìBurns Branch in eastern Oregon was sold on November 6, 1989 to shortline Wyoming Colorado Railroad, but the 120 mile majority of the line was abandoned eastward from Burns to Celatom in June 1992.Union Pacific Railroad, Wyoming Colorado Railroad Company, Inc.

He is viewed as a pioneer in the field of comics and animation in Slovenia, known for the series of comics featuring the characters Zvitorepec, Trdonja, and Lakotnik, and animated TV commercials. Biography Muster first got interested in animation when he saw Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts, University of Ljubljana, with a degree in sculpture. Even during the studies, he wished to join the Disney studios in the US, which was impossible given the post-war political situation. After completing only a couple of statues, he focused on drawing. In 1952, Muster started drawing his comic strip Zvitorepec, which was running in magazines Poletove podobe in povesti (PPP) and Tedenska tribuna. PPP was supposed to publish Disney's comics but as they did not arrive in time, Muster filled in with his own one. From 1955 to 1973, he was drawing for Slovenski poroƒçevalec, later renamed Delo; after that he worked as a freelancer. His work in comics was frowned upon by the Communist Yugoslav government, with socialist realism being the preferred art style and anything too Western undesirable. This attitude continued to some degree even after the Tito‚ÄìStalin Split. In 1973, Muster moved to Munich to pursue a career in animation at Bavaria Film. After Slovenia declared independence, Muster returned home and was for some time drawing caricatures for political magazines Mag and Reporter. For his work, Muster received a series of awards. In 2014, the Journalist's Associacion of Slovenia awarded him the Borut Me≈°ko Award for his achievements in illustration and caricature. Also in 2014, he was awarded the silver order of merit for his pioneering work in the field of comics and animation by the President of Slovenia Borut Pahor. In 2015 he received the Pre≈°eren Award for lifetime achievements, the highest Slovenian award for arts. In 2015 he was awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Nova Gorica. Muster died on 7 May 2018 in a nursing home in Notranje Gorice, aged 92. Work Muster was best known for his comic books featuring the characters Zvitorepec, Trdonja, and Lakotnik; an antropomorphic plucky fox, a wise turtle, and an always-hungry simple-minded wolf. The characters were taken from Slovenian folklore. In a series of volumes, the adventures of the trio took place worldwide, in different historic periods, most notably in the Wild West, in future, and even in space. The episode in space from 1959 caused a minor political incident: the Russian cosmonauts that the trio meets on the trip to the Moon were depicted as bears. The Soviet embassy in Belgrade issued an official protest. In order to resolve the problem, the next volume depicted American astronauts as monkeys, which pleased the Russians (while not bothering the US, where the comics were not published anyway). Some stories outlined real-world problems such as increasing pollution and aggressive driving, while a story about Lakotnik building his own house made fun of the construction process in Yugoslavia in the 1960s. Although some contemporaries criticized Muster's style as \\"too American\\" and \\"too Disneyesque\\", he was nevertheless recognized for his artistic talent. The comics were immensely popular with children and teenagers and remained a mainstay of newspapers and book collections for decades. Muster's other illustrations and comics include stories about Neewa the Bear, Lupinica, Sne≈æko, The Last of the Mohicans, Ostrostrelec, Stezosledec, and others. He was also well-known for his work in animation, especially for TV commercials. Among his best-known works were the Cikcak bunnies and commercials for Mercator, ƒåunga Lunga chewing gum, and Viki krema. While in Munich, Muster collaborated with the Argentinian cartoonist Guillermo Mordillo, creating about 400 of shorts based on his characters. He also worked on the animated adventures of German private detective Nick Knatterton.

Miche is a woman of limited and conventional mind, whose only outside interests are bridge and her Catholic church. Her assets were beauty, now gone, and fidelity. Tony has no outside interests, being a shallow and selfish man, but his asset is charm, which has seen him through his life and now serves to conceal both his constant physical pain and his fear of imminent death.

The opening of the halt was part of an attempt by the Great Western Railway to encourage more passengers on the line at a time when competition from bus services was drawing away patronage. The possibility of reopening the line through Horspath Halt has been explored by Chiltern Railways, the franchise holder for the Chiltern Main Line which runs through . History On 24 October 1864, the Wycombe Railway opened an extension of its single track line to to Kennington junction, just to the south of .Oppitz, 2000, page 17 Although the line ran through the village of Horspath, notably through a tunnel, it was to be a further 40 years before a station was opened here. In an attempt to stimulate Oxford suburban traffic, the Great Western Railway opened three motor halts on the line, one of which was to be situated to the south of Horspath Tunnel. The Board of Trade approved the opening of the halts in December 1907, and they opened to traffic in February 1908; the Board of Trade's Colonel Yorke later inspected the halts the following month. As with the other halts, Horspath had a single platform, long, with a by corrugated iron passenger shelter.Potts, 2004, page 99 In the event, the halt remained open only for seven years, closing in 1915 as a wartime economy measure.Mitchell and Smith, 2003, plate 42 The halt was to reopen in 1933 as part of another push by the GWR to attract passengers; it was situated to the west of the first site.Simpson, 2001, page 71 As with which opened on the same day, Horspath Halt had a long and wide wooden platform (costing ¬£200) with a running in board which displayed the station's name on both sides. The halt was perched on an embankment, the corrugated iron passenger shelter being suspended off the bank with the aid of timbers to the rear of the platform into the embankment side. Responsibility for the unmanned halt with its single oil lamp was given to the station master at .Potts, 2004, page 117 Access to the halt was had via a sloping 1 in 10 fenced path leading up from the Cuddesdon Road where a wicket gate with a lamp was provided. It was to be initially served by 5 trains each way daily, and up to 500 passengers per month were expected.Potts, 2004, page 137 During the Second World War, the local Home Guard cut slits through the corrugated iron shelter so that, in the event of invasion, it might serve as a sort of pillbox.Potts, 2004, pages 159-161 On the basis of an estimated saving of ¬£34,372, passenger services were withdrawn between Oxford and Princes Risborough from January 1963.

The line from here to Kennington Junction is used by car-carrying trains from the BMW Mini plant (see Morris Cowley railway station). The trackbed remains to the east as far as where housing has been built on the site of the former station. A section of the trackbed was purchased in 1982 by Horspath Parish Council who manage the cutting as a nature reserve. The tunnel is owned by Oxfordshire County Council and was converted into a bat hibernaculum in 2002.Horspath and the railway As part of its preparations for its bid to run the Chiltern Railways franchise, Chiltern Railways announced in 2000 that it was looking into the possibility of reinstating passenger services on the line between Oxford and Risborough, the cost of which it estimated at ¬£250m.Oxford Mail, \\"New rail links on the cards\\", 16 August 2000. It was decided instead to build a link between the Oxford to Bicester Line and the Chiltern Main Line in order to run through services between Oxford and London via High Wycombe.

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans.Guldberg, S.(2011) In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaard‚Äôs works are still produced today. Early life and training Jens Quistgaard grew up in an artistic home in Copenhagen and already as a boy, demonstrated unusual artistic talents. The work with handicrafts began in his mothers kitchen, where he made himself a little workshop with vice and anvil. Here he produced jewellery, hunting knives, bags and ceramics. When he was young Jens Quistgaard would often be found at the village smiths, carpenters or joiners, and it was here he acquired the craftsmanship which he later used to produce models in wood, metal, ceramic and glass.Guldberg, S.(2009) and (2011) He was trained as a sculptor by his father, Harald Quistgaard (1887-1979), and was later educated as a drawer and silversmith at the technical school in Copenhagen.Jens Quistgaard himself disproved the belief that he was an apprentice at silversmith Georg Jensens's workshop: \\"At technical school, I had a great drawing teacher, who was employed by Georg Jensen\\",he said, \\"but there was never more than that\\" Guldberg, S.(2011) p. 60 During the occupation of Denmark he was active in the Resistance movement. Work Quistgaard started his career drawing portraits. He also produced jewellery, hunting knives, ceramic works, glass and graphic design in the form of monograms, town arms and the like. At the end of the 1940s his production also included cutlery in silver and steel for different companies, amongst others the silvery cutlery set Champagne (1947 for [O.V. Mogensen]) and kitchen utensils in steel for [Raadvad], including the little shark fin can opener from 1950. His breakthrough as an industrial designer came in 1953-54, where he fashioned the cutlery set Fjord, the first cutlery set that combined stainless steel with handles of teak. Around the same time he designed a saucepan in cast iron for De Forenede Jernstoeberier A/S (United Iron Foundries). The pan was marketed under the name Anker-Line and was awarded the gold medal at the Triennale in Milan in 1954. In the same year, Quistgaard also received The Lunning Prize. 1954 was also the year American businessman Ted Nierenberg visited Europe, on the lookout for talented design which could be launched in the USA. After having seen the cutlery set Fjord at the Danish Museum of Art and Design in Copenhagen, he sought out the designer, and their meeting led to the foundation of the American company Dansk Designs with Quistgaard as chief designer.Guldberg, S. (2009)and (2011) Already towards the end of 1954, Fjord was introduced in New York, followed the year after by the colourful saucepan range Kobenstyle. Quistgaards designs were a big success from the beginning in the USA and were quickly followed by a series of tableware and kitchenware designs: cutlery in silver and handcrafted steel; jugs and saucepans in steel, copper and cast iron; crockery in stoneware; glass; trays, bowls, pepper mills and other objects in staved teak and exotic wood sorts, as well as candlesticks in brass, silver and cast iron. Quistgaard was hugely productive and for Danish Designs alone fashioned more than 4000 products.\\"According to official records, more than 4.500 individual pieces designed by the late Jens H Quistgaard went into production in his lifetime. From boats to cooking pots, from knives to chairs - at the peak of his career in the 1960s and 1970s, Quistgaard was the most prolific Danish designer around. His products far outsold those of contemporaries including Hans Wegner, Arne Jacobsen and Finn Juhl\\", Bagner, A. (2008), p. 131. Cf. Perlson, M. (2008), p. 8 and Koelln. G. (1982) It is a production which spans a large range of materials and utility items, and which is created from a philosophy that utility items for the kitchen and the table should function together harmoniously. To set the table and arrange with Quistgaards designs became from the end of the 1950s and during the 1960s identical with \\"modern living\\" and Scandinavian style.See also Reif, R. (1958) Where clean lines, sculptural form and natural materials went hand in hand. Significant Designs and Retreat The end of the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s were Quistgaard's most productive years for Dansk Designs. In 1958 he designed the cutlery set Toke in steel and bamboo as well as the dinner set Flamestone in stoneware; the cutlery set Tjorn in sterling silver from 1959, the Festivaal line from 1960 of lacquered bowls and trays in many colors, together with a series of industrial designs in exotic wood sorts, Rare Woods from 1961. The series together with the other woodware was produced by Nissens Woodworking Factory in Denmark, which Quistgaard also designed special works for in the 1960s, amongst others the unusual Stick chair from 1966.Form - fra t√∏nder til trend, Kulturhistorisk Museum Randers, 2009 At the end of the 1950s Jens Quistgaard began designing and overseeing the construction of a large villa in Armonk, north of New York, for his American business partner Ted Nierenberg. Quistgaard designed everything, from the large roof constructions and window sections to the doorhandles, bathtub and spiral staircase. The villa was completed in 1961 as a demonstration of Quistgaard's ideal about architectural wholeness. Quistgaard's success escalated throughout the 1960s. His works for Dansk Designs were marketed in all major cities in the USA, but he was also successful in Europe and Japan. Dansk Designs started their own shop in the High Street in Copenhagen, in London and in Stockholm, and Quistgaard's designs were exhibited and sold in Tokyo, Berlin, Paris, Z√ºrich, Melbourne, Johannesburg and many other big cities. Quistgaard continued as chief designer for Dansk Designs until the start of the 1980s, when he moved to Rome. He lived there until 1993, and returned to Denmark, where he continued to design until a few months before his death in 2008. In 2006 he received an honorary grant from the Danish National Banks Anniversary Fund of 1968, and in 2009 was portrayed as a person and as a designer in the documentary film \\"A Saucepan for My Wife\\" The Designer Jens Quistgaard: A Saucepan for My Wife.

It was originally written in Urdu under the title Bazaar-e-Husn (\\"Market of Beauty\\" or Red-light district) but was first published in Hindi from Calcutta as Seva Sadan (\\"The House of Service\\"), in 1919. It was published in Urdu, in 1924, from Lahore. Bazaar-e-Husn was Premchand's first major novel; before it, he had published four novellas in Urdu of about 100 pages each. K. Subramaniam adapted the novel as a Tamil movie, Sevasadanam (1938), which was the first film for the famous Carnatic music singer, M. S. Subbulakshmi. An English translation of this book was released by Oxford University Press, India in New Delhi in 2005. The year is stated to be significant, being the 125th anniversary of Munshi Premchand's birth. Synopsis Bazaar-e-Husn is a tale of an unhappy housewife who is beguiled away from the path of domestic virtue into becoming a courtesan. She then reforms herself and atones by serving as the manager of an orphanage for the young daughters of courtesans, the seva- sadan of the Hindi title. The setting is in the orthodox Hindu religious city of Varanasi, around the turn of the 20th century. The British Raj had introduced Local self-government in India to municipalities, in some cities. The main protagonist is a Brahmin lady named Suman who is married into a loveless union, because of her family's social and financial obligations. She leaves this marriage to become a courtesan, in the \\"kothas\\" of the city. In a twist to the tale, the local municipal corporation, a feature of the then- modernising India, orders these to be relocated outside the city, for social morality. Suman finds her social position is causing problems to her sister's marriage. She then joins to serve a home for widows, and teach them religion. When this becomes untenable ‚Äî as also a stay with her sister who is married to a former admirer ‚Äî Suman finally joins as a teacher, in a home that houses the children of former courtesans. The home is named Seva Sadan (the house of service), from which the title of the novel seems to be derived. Major themes The novel seems to be located firmly in a place ‚Äî Varanasi ‚Äî and in time - the turn of the 20th century: when the British Raj started handing over power to local elites through municipalities, in some towns and cities. While the Urdu title highlights the fall of the heroine, the Hindi title highlights her redemption: It is tempting to see the two titles as widely symptomatic of their respective literary cultures. Vasudha Dalmia, an American academic of South Asian culture with special focus on the Hindi language, has written an introduction to the English translation. This details the context in which the novel is set: the ancient orthodox Hindu city of Varanasi and the spaces of the Kothis and the Benarasi courtesan is stated to be an interesting choice. The Benarasi courtesan filled an important place in the aesthetic and literary culture of North India ‚Äî as well as in the cultural history of the city and its citizens. In another paper, on the significance of this novel to the North Indian society and culture, Vasudha Dalmia points out that the title itself, Seva (service) and Sadanam (house), suggests the many layered social texture of Varanasi. The move to remove the courtesans from the heart of the city (Chauk) can be seen as a metaphor, for a new (North) India, which was seeking to modernise and refashion its image ‚Äî removing courtesans from its heart and shifting them to the periphery. Arshia Sattar in a review of the translation states that \\"Premchand has always used his women characters as the lens through which society is critiqued. A reading his 'Sevasadan' in English translation almost 90 years after it was written brings home the fact that little has changed: women are still striving to control their own destinies.\\" References Category:1919 novels Category:1924 novels Category:Indian novels adapted into films Category:Urdu-language literature Category:Hindi- language novels Category:Urdu-language novels Category:Novels set in Varanasi Category:Novels by Premchand Category:Books about women Category:Prostitution in India Category:Novels set in British India ","title":"Bazaar-e-Husn"},{"id":"23865300","text":"John Doehring (November 6, 1909November 18, 1972) was an American football halfback/fullback in the National Football League.

The name is short for Shenjiang Xinbao, Shenjiang being a short form of Chunshen Jiang, the old name for the Huangpu River.Endymion Wilkinson, Chinese History: A Manual, Revised and Enlarged (Harvard University Asia Center, 2000: ), p. 967. The influence of the newspaper in early 20th century Shanghai was such that Shen Bao zhi, literally \\"Shen-pao paper\\", became a generic term for newspaper or newsprint.Ëî£ÈÅµÂíå (Jiang Zunhe), ‚ÄúÊãøÂºµÁî≥Â†±Á¥ô‰æÜ‚ÄùÊòØ‰ªÄÈ∫ºÊÑèÊÄù (What does \\"bring a sheet of Shen Pao paper mean\\"?), Shanghai Municipal Archives (re-published by EastDay).  Formation  Founded by Ernest Major (1841‚Äì1908),Dates from Roberta Wue, \\"The Profits of Philanthropy: Relief Aid, Shenbao, and the Art World in Later 19th-century Shanghai,\\" Late Imperial China 25 (June 2004), pp. 187-211. a British businessman, in 1872, Shen Bao was one of the first modern Chinese newspapers. Major‚Äôs Chinese language skills had been considered ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù and with the investment of four other Britons, he began managing Shen Bao. He was committed to bettering China by adopting Western Institutions and running a profitable business. (When Major returned to England in 1889, the newspaper was reorganized as Major Company Limited.Chinese History Research Site at UCSD, Miscellaneous Sources.) Because Shen Bao was based and published out of the International Settlement in Shanghai, it was subject to fewer regulations compared to many other Chinese newspapers. The International Settlement was governed by the Municipal Council which was completely separate from the Qing court and foreign consulate. The freedom of press granted in the International Settlement in Shanghai was ‚Äúeven greater than that enjoyed by British papers in London itself‚Äù. (Wagner, 4) Because of this lack of state regulation, Shen Bao was considered a reliable and independent source of information and ‚Äúhad acquired the reputation of being more independent and more reliable than most of the other available sources‚Äù (Wagner, 5). Chinese officials considered foreign journalists to be ‚Äúinfinitely more credible, reliable and honest than their own countrymen‚Äù. (Wagner, 19) Major specifically adopted an editorial policy geared toward improving China‚Äôs long-term growth and development. To further grow the business and establish itself as a ‚Äúpublic forum in China‚Äù Shen Bao regularly reprinted essays from Xunhuan ribao in Hong Kong and the Jingbao announcements from the government. Furthermore, Shen Bao frequently published the essays of great reformist publicit Liang Qichao who has been ‚Äúhailed as the father of modern Chinese journalism‚Äù. Although he did not invent the new newspaper style in the 1890s, he is said to have perfected it. (Judge, 235) Major differentiated himself from other foreign newspaper publishers in two areas. First, from the outset, he made it clear that the new newspaper would be for Chinese readers, and thus that it would emphasize news and issues of interest to Chinese, not foreigners. Secondly, he put Chinese compradors in charge of running the business and let Chinese editors pick news items and write editorials. These two methods proved very effective. While the Chinese compradors used their knowledge of and connections with the local community to raise circulation and attract advertisements, they kept the price of the paper lower than that of its competitor. Simultaneously, Chinese editors did a better job of making Shen Bao appeal to Chinese readers' taste. Within one year, Shen Bao had put Shanghai Xinbao out of business and become the only Chinese newspaper in Shanghai until the appearance of Xin Bao in 1876 and Hu Bao in 1882.Yongming Zhou, Historicizing Online Politics: Telegraphy, the Internet, and Political Participation in China (Stanford University Press, 2006: ), p. 45. Archibald R. Colquhoun, wrote in 1906 comparing British and Chinese presses: ‚ÄúIn general character the Chinese press resembles that of Europe. There are leaders and leaderettes, news item, telegrams, scraps of general information and advertisement. Along the top, where we are accustomed to see the title, runs the pious exhortation to \\" respect the written word,\\" and the custom of reverently collecting and burning all printed matter still survives‚Äù. (Calhoun, 101)  Role in public opinion  Shen Bao played a pivotal role in the formation of public opinion in the late 19th century. An example is its campaign in its first years against the new practice of employing young women as waitress in opium dens, which \\"blurred the demarcation line between acceptable and unacceptable practices by putting waitresses in the ambiguous position of implicitly providing sex services in the opium dens. Worse still, the opium dens embracing this practice were mostly located in the French Concession, connecting the issue to the presence of foreigners in Shanghai.\\"Zhou, Historicizing Online Politics, p. 50. As a result of the uproar, the practice was banned (although in practice not eradicated). Shen Bao also reflected the changing attitudes towards women as a new audience group - how the newspaper ‚Äúdescribed them in advertisements, editorials ad news reports‚Äù. Women became a group that could be considered: adverts were directed at the feminine reading public. Newspaper was able to address women directly but also prescribed new feminine roles. (Needs reference) This new role gave rise to the acceptance of public female schooling. (Needs reference)  Impact on Chinese society  The newspaper \\"innovated in printing technology, the use of the telegraph, the employment of a military correspondent (sent to cover the Sino-French War in Vietnam in 1884), and the use of the vernacular (baihua)\\";Wilkinson, Chinese History, p. 967. it quickly established a reputation as one of the best in China, coming under Chinese ownership in 1909,Wilkinson, Chinese History, p. 968. and by the early 20th century was printing 30,000 copies a day, 9,000 circulated in Shanghai and the rest elsewhere in China.Mary Ninde Gamewell, New Life Currents in China (Missionary Education Movement of the United States and Canada, 1919), pp. 162-163. \\"By the early 1920s its circulation was 50,000; by the end of the decade 100,000; and by the mid 1930s, 150,000.\\"Wilkinson, Chinese History, p. 995. Shen Bao was also notably a part of the commercialization of the Chinese press in the 1930s that prioritized advertising and mass circulation. (MacKinnon, 9) The paper's offices were in the International Settlement, \\"about a block away from the Central Police Station.\\"Harriet Sergeant, Shanghai: Collision Point of Cultures 1918-1939 (Crown, 1991: ), p. 162. In its early period, it had eight pages, with news, essays, and advertisements as well as imperial decrees and memorials. \\"Because the editorial policies followed the principle of 'reporting whatever possible and letting the readers determine the truth,' many interesting but unfounded rumors were often included as news.\\" After 1905, it increased its size to 20 pages.Chinese History Research Site at UCSD, Miscellaneous Sources. Shen Bao also became a conduit between the high and low society, connecting the two in a way that was largely unprecedented. The court was the loudest and most continuous voice in the public sphere and continued to be with the publication of newspapers. The court had a specific section called guanbao which were a print form of Jingbao, a government approved set of public communications posted on boards in front of the government. Guanbao became the preferred method of communication and increased communication between high and low. (Wagner, 11) Additionally, Shen Bao allowed ‚Äúthose below‚Äù to speak out about their opinions and criticism anonymously or in person. The publication of Jingbao gave a platform for public discussion of important issues between classes. Shen Bao published multiple editorials from opposite ends of the spectrum - sometimes even within the same issue. (Wagner, 19)  Political affiliation and effects  Shen Bao was founded as a commercial newspaper, and politically it remained conservative for its first three decades, supporting the Qing government. In 1905 it began to change its orientation, quoting Liang Qichao's constitutionalist slogans on New Year's Day; in 1907 it was sold to Xi Zipei (1867‚Äì1929),Dates from Ellen Widmer, \\"The Saoye shanfang of Suzhou and Shanghai: An Evolution in Five Stages\\" [Word document]; Xi's name in Chinese is Â∏åÂ≠ê‰Ω©. its former comprador, who \\"owned Shanghai's best-capitalized publishing operation, Zhongguo tushu gongsi (Chinese Library Company)\\"Christopher A.

In 1912 control was transferred to Shi Liangcai. \\"In the 1930s, Shi was a strong supporter of the Human Rights Defence Alliance established by Madam Soong Qing Ling, the second wife of revolutionary leader Dr Sun Yat-sen, with Cai Yuanpei and Lu Xun.\\"Patsy Yang and Jolin Ng, \\"Cheers for favorite old bars and some newbies in Tongren Road ,\\" Shanghai Daily, July 13, 2009. There is some scholarly debate of the role of Shen Bao in igniting revolutionary and nationalist sentiments; however, it is generally regarded that ‚Äúnewspapers at most echoed, rather than produced, revolutionary or national feelings. Instead of making revolutions, it was made by them‚Äù (Judge 247). ‚Äú[The press] was not merely an record of what happened but and ingredient in the happening‚Äù.  End of publication  Due to the surveillance from Chiang Kai-Shek on the press, Shen Bao and other newspapers were frequently censored using postal bans for one day when they criticized government policy too strongly. Most of the time this was an effective enough deterrent, however, in July 1932, a warning was sent that the postal ban would not be lifted until Shen Bao fulfilled the following government requests: First, stop publishing editorials about the government's ‚Äúbandit suppression‚Äù campaigns, dismiss three of the most critical editorial writers, and allow the government to appoint a new member to the editorial staff. (Mackinnon, 16). Shen Bao fulfilled all but the latter request. In 1934, the newspaper \\"incurred the government's anger because of its strong anti-Japanese attitude. On November 13, Shih Liang-ts'ai, its owner and editor-in-chief, was mysteriously assassinated on the Shanghai-Hangchow Highway\\";Lee-hsia Hsu Ting, Government Control of the Press in Modern China, 1900-1949 (Harvard University Asia Center, 1975: ), p. 97. responsibility for his murder has been attributed to the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, Chiang Kai-shek's much-feared secret police.John K. Fairbank and Albert Feuerwerker, eds., The Cambridge History of China, Vol. 13: Republican China 1912-1949, Part 2 (Cambridge University Press, 1986: ), p. 144.Frederic E. Wakeman, Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese Secret Service (University of California Press, 2003: ), pp. 179ff. In 1938, with the city under Japanese control, Norwood Allman (1893‚Äì1987), an American lawyer who had been U.S. Consul in Shanghai in the early 1920s, was asked by the paper's Chinese owners to take over as editor; Time wrote in 1940: \\"A fluent Chinese linguist, Allman reads every story that goes into Shun Pao, writes editorials, corrects editorials written by staff members. He serves without pay.\\"Time, \\"Foreign News: New Order in Shanghai,\\" July 29, 1940. The paper was on bad terms with the Japanese, and in 1940 a Chinese assistant editor was killed and his head left on the street as a warning to journalists.Paul French, Carl Crow, a Tough Old China Hand: The Life, Times, and Adventures of an American in Shanghai (Hong Kong University Press, 2007: ), p. 212. After the murder of Shih Liang- ts‚Äôai, the paper lost circulation and became less radical in its criticism of Nationalist Party of China (Guomindang). (MacKinnon, 11) Allman had control over the paper until December 1941 when it was seized by the Japanese on the ground that it was an American company. Allman had incorporated it as an American company purposefully to limit his financial liability. (Chin, 5). The Japanese appointed Chen Binhe (), a former Shen bao editor-in-chief who gained the trust of the Japanese, as the new president of Shen bao. (Chin, 6) ‚ÄúAs a result, [of these new appointments] Shen bao became a mouthpiece and propaganda tool for mobilizing the Chinese masses politically, economically, and culturally for total war‚Äù (Chin, 9). During World War II the paper passed into the hands of collaborators with the Japanese occupation, but after the war Pan Gongzhan, an influential Kuomintang party official who had been an editor on the paper in the late 1920s,Xiaoqun Xu, Chinese Professionals and the Republican State: The Rise of Professional Associations in Shanghai, 1912-1937 (Cambridge University Press, 2001: ), p. 171. became its publisher and Chen Shuny√º its chief editor.

It is dedicated to Saint Breage or Breaca, said to have been an Irish nun who came to Cornwall in the 5th-century. Description The church was built of granite in the 15th-century: it has two aisles separated from the nave by granite arcades of standard design. On the north wall are five medieval wall paintings: four saints are portrayed, Ambrose, Christopher, Corentine and Hilary (there are fragmentary ones also), and the Warning to the Sabbath-Breakers, one of the finest examples in the country of a Sunday Christ. Another fine example is to be found a few miles away in St Just. A Roman milestone of the 3rd-century is preserved in the church and in the churchyard there is an unusual Hiberno-Saxon cross head.Pevsner, N. Buildings of England: Cornwall (1951; 1970) (rev. Enid Radcliffe) Penguin Books (reissued by Yale U. P.) ; p. 46 The inscription on the milestone is: IMP [C] DO NO MARC CASSI: this incomplete text refers to the Emperor (Marcus Cassianus) Postumus, 258-68 AD (Collingwood, RIB no. 2232). The church reopened on feast day, 26 December 1879, following the restoration of the chancel which was enlarged and choir stalls provided. The roof was repaired, walls plastered and the floor pointed. The church contains the vault of the Godolphin family. History After the Norman Conquest the church of Breage was of interest to three lords: the Bishop of Exeter who held the manor of Methleigh, the Earl of Cornwall who held the manor of Winnianton, and the Earl of Gloucester who held the manor of Binnerton.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 63-64 In the 12th-century the Earl of Gloucester (Lord of the manor of Binnerton) gave the church to the abbey of Tewkesbury but in this he exceeded his legal power and after eighty-six years the Earl of Cornwall intervened and bestowed it on the abbey of Hailes. The parish of Breage had until the 19th-century the unusual feature of dependent parochial chapels at Germoe, Cury and Gunwalloe, the last two being added to it in 1246 by the Earl.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 63-64 Organ The organ was built by Henry Willis and Sons for Thomas Robins Bolitho. It then moved to Truro Cathedral and was rebuilt in Breage in 1968 by Hele & Co of Plymouth. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Born in Seattle, Washington, she was the daughter and eldest child of Chicago native, Arthur Charles John Schoennauer, and Prussian immigrant, Ida Amalia Ottilie Welk. Irma‚Äôs father was a career typesetter employed by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer for most of his life; her mother was a seamstress and clothing designer. As a teen, Irmgard attended Lincoln High School in Seattle, and graduated from the University of Washington in 1942 with a BA degree in Communications. As a freshman, she was a member of \\"Chi of Phrateres,\\" a philanthropic-social organization for female college students at the University.\\"The 1939 Tyee: A Year of University Life,\\" University Yearbook, published by the Associated Students of the University of Washington, Pages 361-2; as reprinted by and accessed at Ancestry.com: U.S. School Yearbooks on 2011/08/25. Born the year female swimmers became the first American women to achieve full Olympic status,The International Swimming Hall of Fame‚Äôs Timeline of Women‚Äôs Swimming History ; accessed 2009/08/11. Irma began her competitive swimming career as a child at Green Lake in Seattle, having local swimming champion Helene MadisonSportsReference/Olympic Sports: Helene Madison . as her older role model. Quickly recognized for her natural swimming ability and competitive spirit, Imgard was invited to join the swimming team of the Washington Athletic Club in 1935, soon winning numerous local, regional, statewide, and multi-state telegraph races,See Auburn Tigers swimming and diving for an example of another facility in the 1930s that telegraphed competitive swimming results: \\"The program had to telegraph their timed results to other schools and compare as the pool was too small for competitions;\\" and \\"Swimmers were timed and results were telegraphed to other schools for comparisons.\\" and was a member of the 400-yard relay team that won the National Championship in 1938.Although she swam competitively while as a student at the University of Washington during the 1938-39 school year, because of the politics of the university swimming program and because of her professional loyalty to the Washington Athletic Club and the personal loyalty to her coach, outside of that one year she reserved her competition swimming under the WAC sponsorship. Groomed to compete in 1940 Summer Olympics, she continued competitive swimming after the outbreak of World War II, even though the Olympic games were suspended by the IOC. It is very likely, had it not been for the war, she would have competed on the United States Olympic swim team, possibly alongside peer, Esther Williams of California. She made a career as a civil servant for the Federal Government for over 40 years; starting with the Department of the Interior at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state after graduating from college, the Department of the War (Army & Air Force) in California during the latter part of World War II, and the Social Security Administration from about 1953 in various states, including California, Kansas, Maryland and finally Washington, where she retired about 1982. Irma married Melvin Leroy Cole of Arkansas in 1955 in Ellensburg, Washington. Because they both worked for the same government agency, after married they rarely resided in the same city.For further information on the U.S. Government's nepotism and dual-career couples policy, see extract of \\"Handbook of state government administration\\" By John J. Gargan. The policy was enforced very strictly in the Social Security Administration during the 1950s. Although two children were born of this union, partly as a result of this forced separation, they divorced in 1963. Besides her lifelong interest in swimming, she enjoyed travelling by train (she never got a driver‚Äôs license, owned a car, or flew in a plane), investing in real estate, and researching her family history. Irma died in Tacoma, Washington at the age of 83.Obituary from The Seattle Times, Seattle, WA; November 8, 2003. Her body was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Seattle, next to her beloved father. Upon her death in 2003, she was survived by one of her brothers, her two sons, and one grandchild.

It is found in over 2000 libraries.worldCat  Synopsis  The book centers on 10-year-old tomboy Christina who, to her displeasure, has to spend her summer with her grumpy uncle after her grandmother becomes ill. Uncle Ralph is house sitting for a friend in an old, spooky, and isolated lake-side Victorian mansion. Once she gets there she finds a room that looks as if it had once belonged to a little boy. There she sees, for the first time, a little boy in a blue sailor suit, who disappears before Christina can talk to him. She also finds out that whatever she does, she cannot get inside the attic even though she hears noises coming from there. Christina decides she wants to know why the little boy is there. On a trip to the nearby city, Christina looks for old newspapers to see if she can find any information about the house. She finds a newspaper dated 30 years ago. It says that a murder took place in the house after a man stole some valuable stamps. The men whom he stole from found out where he was staying and went to kill him. The little boy was killed simply because he had witnessed the murder. One of the murderers confessed and said that they never found the stamps. When Christina gets back she sits down to read a comic book she had taken from the little boy's room. Suddenly she hears something descending from the attic. Once again she sees the boy, but this time his expression is of terror, pointing at the comic book Christina is reading. The stamps have been hidden in the boys comic book for 30 years. Christina and her uncle flee the house as the ghost of the sitter causes chaos. They manage to escape and spend the night in a nearby town. They turn the stamps in to the local sheriff's office the next morning. When they arrive back at the house, that morning, they find the doors and windows all open, the mustiness of the house gone, replaced with fresh air and bright sunlight. Upon further investigating, Christina concludes the ghost of the little boy is finally at peace now that the mystery surrounding his untimely death has been solved.

History Bonner & Associates was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1984 by Jack Bonner as a public affairs firm. Bonner was previously the Director for Community Relations for the City of Tucson, Arizona and also served as a top aid for US Senator, John Heinz (PA). Bonner & Associates was one of the early public affairs companies involved in many large scale grass-roots campaigns for a wide range of clients at the local, state and federal levels of government. The company has been listed as the ‚Äúpioneer of grassroots efforts‚Äù by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times and has also been featured on CSPAN explaining their approach to grassroots lobbying. They have worked with Fortune 500 corporations, associations and non-profits to educate and mobilize third party constituent advocates to help their clients win legislative/regulatory fights and promote public education programs. Bonner & Associates specializes in seizing on unformed public sentiment. The firm‚Äôs on important legislative issues has been in published books on issues include taxation, healthcare, transportation and international trade. Advocacy efforts * On December 3, 1990, Fortune Magazine reported on how Bonner put together a major campaign for the auto industry. Bonner & Associates conducted more than half of their business outside of Washington D.C at the state and local levels of government. * On September 27, 1999, PR Week quoted leaders of the 3 million member Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) on why they hired Bonner & Associates to help them become a more potent political force. * On January 1, 2012 The Officer Magazine, published by the Reserve Officers Association (ROA) describes Bonner & Associates the process for assembling a successful and effective grassroots campaign for an organization. Criticism * On December 18, 1986, The New York Times reported that the company was hired to run a toll free line for people to request ‚ÄúWhat Works: Schools Without Drugs,‚Äù a free book on drug abuse. The program received several large requests for the book. After an internal investigation the management at Bonner & Associates found several employees in direct violation of the policy of the firm and the contract by adding names and addresses compiled from sources other than the toll free number assigned for that purpose. The firm fired the employees and immediately reported their actions to the government. * On December 3, 1994, National Journal reported that Bonner & Associates was hired by Philip Morris to oppose nonsmoking laws in several states. * On March 9, 2002, the Baltimore Sun reported that Bonner & Associates was hired by PhRMA to oppose subsidized prescription drug programs for seniors. * On August 1, 2009, The Washington Post reported that a temporary staffer contrary to firm policies was discovered by Bonner & Associates to have sent forged letters to the Hill. * In 2009, Bonner & Associates found that a company employee was violating their company policy and was forging anti-climate bill letters to Rep. Tom Perriello (Dem-VA). The letters were supposedly from local minority groups, like the Charlottesville NAACP or Creciendo Juntos‚Äîcomplete with their stationery‚Äîand urged him to oppose the ACES climate change bill. The company immediately fired the employee they said was responsible and apologized.

It revolutionised the wool industry. The former Murray Shire Council erected a monument to him where he lived at the time, referring to his invention: \\"It has become part of the rich history of the wool industry and is now perpetuated in poem and song.\\" Family Born in Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire) in County Dublin Ireland, Frederick was the third son of the seven surviving children of Major Garnet Joseph Wolseley (1780‚Äì1840) of The King's Own Scottish Borderers (25th Foot) and of the family of Mount Wolseley, co. Carlow, and Frances Anne (1801‚Äì1883) daughter of William Smith of Dublin. His eldest brother became Field Marshal Wolseley and a hero of the Victorian era, another brother became General Sir George Wolseley.Joseph Jackson Howard, Visitation of England and Wales (Volume 19), p.10 Their father died in 1840 leaving their mother little more than his army pension and the brothers were educated at the local day school instead of being sent to England.Halik Kochanski, Sir Garnet Wolseley: Victorian hero The Hambledon Press, London 1999 The seven children remained close-knit throughout their lives.Ian J. Itter, compiler, Wolseley, Letters concerning Fred, Swan Hill Victoria, Australia, 2007 He married his nurse, Ellen Elizabeth Clarke (1850‚Äì1922), in Melbourne in 1892. She looked after him through his long final illness. They had no children. Pastoralist and inventor Frederick Wolseley, unassisted, went to Melbourne from Ireland, arriving in July 1854,Public Record Office Victoria Index to Unassisted Inward Passenger Lists to Victoria 1852‚Äì1923 aged 17, to be a jackaroo on his future brother-in-law's sheep station. His sister Fanny's husband, Gavin Ralston Caldwell, they married in Dublin in 1857, held Thule, on the Murray River, and later added nearby Cobran near Deniliquin; both stations were in New South Wales.Walsh, G. P., 'Wolseley, Frederick York (1837‚Äì1899)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6, (MUP), 1976 Caldwell died in 1868. About that time, Wolseley set to work developing his ideas for a sheep shearing machine. By 1872, he had created a working model. He returned from a visit to England and Ireland in 1874 and continued development in Melbourne with Richard Park & Co, an engineering business where a few years later Herbert Austin, a new immigrant from England, was to serve an apprenticeship. Austin's uncle was works manager.Roy Church, 'Austin, Herbert, Baron Austin (1866‚Äì1941)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Having acquired an interest in them, Wolseley lived on Cobran and Thule until 1876, 22 years in the same district. In 1871 he acquired Toolong in the Murrumbidgee district, five years later another property, Euroka near Walgett. Now living at Euroka, he continued testing and on 28 March 1877 he and Robert Savage (1818‚Äì1888), the inventor of various items of mining and agricultural machinery, were granted a patent. Another patent was granted in December; however their machine was not a success and Wolseley continued to work on it but without Savage.O'Neill, Sally, 'Savage, Robert (1818‚Äì1888)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6, (MUP), 1976 He made further developments with Richard Pickup Park and they patented an 'Improved Shearing Apparatus' on 13 December 1884. The following year, Wolseley bought John Howard's rights to his horse clipper and hired him to work as a mechanic on his Euroka station. There Howard made improvements that were so effective that Wolseley began public demonstrations in Sydney and at Euroka. A William Ryley made suggestions for improving the handpiece. In 1887‚Äì1888, demonstrations were arranged throughout eastern Australia and New Zealand. The culmination was the first complete shearing by machinery which took place at Sir Samuel McCaughey's woolshed at Dunlop, Louth, N.S.W. and that year, 1888, eighteen more woolsheds were equipped with Wolseley machinery. During 1887, Herbert Austin joined, as chief engineer, Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company Limited, incorporated in Sydney, a new business linked to R G Parks & Co, to make Wolseley's machinery in his workshops at Goldsbrough Mort & Co. Ltd Melbourne. This company was wound up in 1889 and ownership transferred to a new British company, The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company incorporated in London with a capital of ¬£200,000. Operations remained in Australia, Austin studied the machinery while it was in use on sheep stations and made further patented improvements. Meanwhile Wolseley again visited England leaving Austin in charge. By 1893 they were facing a crisis when it was discovered they had sold a large amount of defective machinery, brought about by the failure of local suppliers to meet the required specifications. It was decided to leave John Howard in charge in Australia and send Austin to open up an operation in England. In November 1893, Wolseley and Austin arrived there, Austin to manage the business from a small workshop in Broad Street, Birmingham. Handsome, likeable and well built, Wolseley was obliged to buy the engineering knowledge and experience to bring his ideas to fruition. His perseverance led to his machinery revolutionising the wool industry. Handicapped throughout his final ten years by his battle with cancer, he resigned as managing director of his company in 1894 and made what proved to be a brief return to Australia. Going back to England that same year for specialised treatment, he remained there, where he died aged 61 on 8 January 1899 at The Red House, Belvedere Road, Norwood, Surrey, and was buried at Beckenham cemetery. Name plate: Vickers, Sons & Maxim Wolseley Siddeley =Cars= In the second half of the 1890s, Austin turned his attention to car manufacture as a way of stabilising the Wolseley business's inherent seasonal fluctuations. His first attempts were among the pioneer motorcars of Britain but they were not produced commercially until the Wolseley directors lost interest in the venture and shortly after Wolseley's death Vickers, Sons and Maxim took over the embryo business, Austin and the Wolseley name. This new business was incorporated with the name The Wolseley Tool & Motor Car Company Limited. After less than five years there, Austin set out on his own and built himself The Austin Motor Company Limited at Longbridge, Birmingham. Wolseley's machine The machine clips the wool at its full length which often doubles or triples its value, it also removes the wool in a fleece instead of chopping it into small pieces like the shears.The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine The Times, Monday, 28 October 1889; pg. 13; Issue 32841 The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company Limited of London Prospectus.

Situated along the Pacific Flyway, the Refuge is the only one of its kind, located below sea level. Because of its southern latitude, elevation and location in the Colorado Desert, the Refuge experiences some of the highest temperatures in the nation. Daily temperatures from May to October generally exceed 100 ¬∞F with temperatures of 116¬∞‚Äì120 ¬∞F recorded yearly. History The refuge was established as a sanctuary and breeding ground for birds and wild animals in 1930. In 1998, the refuge was renamed after Congressman Sonny Bono, who played an active role in trying to save the Salton Sea. Originally, it included approximately . Nearly 60 percent of the original acreage was an open saline lake with the remainder being shoreline alkali flats, freshwater wetlands, native desert scrub and upland (farm fields). Due to the inflow of agricultural effluent and a subsequent rise in the level of the Salton Sea, all of the original Refuge area has been inundated. At present, only about manageable remain suitable for farming and wetland development. Geography The topography of the refuge is flat, except for Rock Hill, which is located at the refuge headquarters. The refuge is bordered by the Salton Sea on the north and intensively farmed agricultural lands on the east, south and west. The refuge is composed of two disjunctive units, separated by of private lands. Each unit contains managed wetland habitat, agricultural fields, and tree rows. The courses of the New and Alamo rivers run through the refuge, providing freshwater inflow to the Salton Sea. Refuge habitats The Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1930 by executive order as a breeding ground for birds and wild animals. Primary objectives on the refuge include endangered species production and maintenance, sensitive species production and maintenance, wintering waterfowl maintenance, and other migratory bird management. Refuge habitats are intensively managed. Ponds, forests, and agricultural fields are designed, developed and manipulated to achieve wildlife objectives. =Wetlands= The refuge has of manageable wetland units, which are managed for resident and migratory bird species such as waterfowl, shorebirds and wading birds. In addition, specified impoundments are managed as permanent wetlands to provide critical nesting and year-round habitat for the endangered Yuma clapper rail. Refuge wetlands provide nesting habitat for a variety of other species, including the least bittern, white- faced ibis, black-necked stilt and American avocet. All wetlands are flooded from water supplied by the Imperial Irrigation District. This water is termed \\"class 1\\" irrigation water, which is free of fertilizers, toxic pesticides and high levels of salts that are common in agricultural drain water. =Tree rows= The refuge manages tree rows for native species and biodiversity. Species planted include honey mesquite, screwbean mesquite, blue palo verde, Mexican palo verde, fairy duster, sweet acacia, catclaw acacia, and desert ironwood. Tree rows continue to receive additional plantings throughout the year in order to add density and width, and to better meet wildlife and habitat objectives. =Croplands= Wildlife management at the Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR involves an intensive farming program to provide suitable forage for over 30,000 wintering geese and other migratory birds and wildlife. Croplands constitute of the refuge, with many fields cooperatively farmed by local farmers. Crops planted on refuge land includes alfalfa, wheat, rye grass, milo, millet, and sudan grass. With use restrictions on the use of certain pesticides on the refuge, infestations of white flies, and the booming prices of sudan grass, many cooperative farmers have switched from planting alfalfa to sudan grass over the years. Sudan grass grows like a weed in the Imperial Valley and requires little to no use of pesticides. Wildlife Lesser nighthawk at the refuge headquarters The Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR is geographically located within the southwestern edge of the Colorado zone of the Sonoran Desert biome. This location, coupled with an elevation of below sea level, results in extremely low annual precipitation and extremely high day time temperatures. Despite the harsh environmental conditions, the Salton Sea supports one of the most diverse avian compositions in the United States as well as a host of endangered and other wildlife species. Habitat diversity on Refuge lands provides for the needs of resident wildlife species as well as numerous seasonal residents and migrants of the Pacific Flyway. Over 400 bird species have been recorded at the Refuge and at least 93 species have nested on the Refuge. In addition, 41 species of mammals, 18 species of reptiles, 4 species of amphibians and 15 species of fish have been identified in the area. Numbers and species of birds that can be seen on the Refuge vary according to season. Heavy migrations of waterfowl, marsh and shorebirds occur during spring and fall. Throughout the mild winter and spring a wide variety of songbirds and birds of prey are present. They are attracted to the freshwater marshes and riparian habitat along the New and Alamo rivers. The greatest number of species are present from November to May. =Mammals= Visibility varies greatly from species to species due to the nocturnal habits of some and seasonal hibernation of others. Most rodent species exist in terrestrial habitats where they provide important food resources for raptors and other predators. During winter months, rodents provide food for heron and egret species as well. Muskrats are present in freshwater drains and ponds where their feeding and burrowing activities help maintain marsh habitats for various other wildlife species. * Desert cottontail * Merriam's kangaroo rat * Raccoon * Valley pocket gopher * Coyote * Round-tailed ground squirrel * Striped skunk * Desert pocket mouse * Muskrat =Amphibians= Due to environmental factors, amphibians are not found in large numbers or diversity at the Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR. Species occurring on the refuge include bullfrogs and lowland leopard frogs. Lowland leopard frogs respond well to shallow, permanent wetland habitat created for the Yuma clapper rail. They are not present elsewhere on the Refuge due to competition from exotic bullfrogs. Woodhouse's toad and red-spotted toads are also found on the refuge. =Reptiles= Many different species of reptiles occur on the refuge. Common species include the gopher snake, western diamondback snake, coachwhip, common kingsnake, whiptail lizard, desert spiny lizard and side-blotched lizard. The spiny soft-shell turtle and the desert tortoise are also found on the refuge. Spiny soft-shell turtles are found in freshwater drains and ponds, while the desert tortoise, although rarely seen, can be found in the upland desert areas. =Fish= Fish populations thrive in the Salton Sea. The aquatic ecosystem is extremely productive because of the large amounts of nutrients it receives. The nutrients stimulate growth of phytoplankton and algae, which in turn, support zooplankton and worms. All of this provides a continuing supply of food for fish. Periodically, decomposition of large algal blooms diminishes the dissolved oxygen in the water. This decomposition has been tied to occasional fish die-offs that occur throughout the year. Tilapia is the most common fish found in the Salton Sea. Tilapia is the most populous fish in the Sea due to its ability to adapt to highly saline conditions and the fact that it is a prolific breeder. Tilapia are an important food source for birds and other fish, along with being a popular game fish. They can weigh more than . =Endangered species= * California brown pelican * Yuma rail * Desert pupfish Trails The refuge has two walking trails: the Rock Hill Trail and the Michael Hardenberger Trail. The Rock Hill Trail is approximately roundtrip, leading visitors through several different habitats. It begins next to the picnic area at the Visitor Center and ends on the top of Rock Hill (), which is located on the edge of the Salton Sea. The Michael Hardenberger Trail is located at Unit 1 off Vendel Road, which is at the south end of the Salton Sea. The ¬Ω-mile trail encircles one of the freshwater ponds, a favorite nesting spot for the endangered Yuma clapper rail.

The region is also described as the West Fermanagh Scarplands by environmental agencies and shares many similar karst features with the nearby Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark. The caves are situated under the hills of Tullybrack () ‚Äì which incorporates Glenkeel () and Knockmore () ‚Äì and Belmore () and feature three major cave systems: Reyfad‚ÄìGlenkeel, Noon's Hole‚ÄìArch Cave and Boho Caves. They have been described as nationally significant by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. The caves and related features are formed predominantly in the Dartry Limestone Formation ‚Äì a sequence of rocks assigned to the Asbian sub-stage of the Visean stage of the Carboniferous period. Within this Formation, the Knockmore Limestone Member is also an important cave forming rock sequence. Cave development has occurred within the Quaternary period and certain features are ascribed to the Holocene epoch of the last 10,000 years. With the exception of Arch Cave, all of the caves and related karstic features listed below have been designated as provisional Areas of Special Scientific Interest (provisional ASSIs or PASSI's) ‚Äì a conservation designation in Northern Ireland equivalent to SSSI's in other parts of the United Kingdom.  Belmore Mountain  = Boho Caves = Quarry Entrance of Boho Cave, in flood. Grid Ref: H12684431. The Boho Caves are a selection of caves encompassing the main Boho Cave, the smaller Waterfall Cave and Upper and Lower Ravine Caves. The Boho Cave system is the sixth-longest cave system in Northern Ireland and is the only example of joint-controlled caves in Northern Ireland. = Aghnaglack Cave = Grid ref: H108436. This small cave is part of the Boho Cave system and has been designated a Provisional Area of Special Scientific Interest (PASSI) site. The substrata dates from the Holocene epoch of the Quaternary period and is composed of limestone. There are two passages in this cave estimated to be about long, one of which has been enlarged as a souterrain and is also a scheduled ancient monument. = Aghnaglack Rising = Grid ref: H10884343. This cave is also part of the Boho Cave system and has been designated a PASSI. The substrata date from the Holocene and are composed of limestone. This formation can be crawled through in dry conditions. = Pollnagollum, Coolarkan = alt=Photo of Pollnagollum Coolarkan entrance and nearby waterfall Grid ref: H12214311. (). This site is designated as a PASSI. The rocks comprise Dartry Limestone, chert, and some calcite formations. The cave can be entered by a previously collapsed roof structure through which a large waterfall flows. The stream runs through the cave until it comes to a boulder choke which has so far proved to be impenetrable. The stream resurfaces onto the valley floor of the Aghanaglack River 1.8 km to the west north west. Early speleological visits to the cave include that of Henry Lyster Jameson in 1895, primarily to collect specimens of fauna. Pictures of Pollnagollum Coolarkan on Flickr:  Tullybrack  The second karst system in the Boho area is known as the Reyfad‚ÄìCarrickbeg system, containing a number of very impressive features. The Northern Ireland Environmental Agency describe this system as follows: \\"the quality of geomorphological and geological features in the Reyfad‚ÄìPollnacrom‚ÄìPolltullybrack cave system make it arguably the most important underground karst site in Northern Ireland.\\" = Carrickbeg Rising Cave (Bunty Pot) = Grid ref: H11724670. The rocks here date from the Quaternary, Carboniferous period and are designated PASSI. This cave is approximately 1 km long in a north‚Äìsouth direction and is divided into two parts. The main body of water flowing through the cave is traversable, but there is a 10 m flooded sump which emerges in another section known as the Farr Out Series. Carrickbeg Rising is the proven resurgence of four major stream sinks within the system: Pollnacrom, Polltullybrack, Waterfall Sink and Watson's Sink. = Fairy Cave = Grid ref: H09254750. The passages here date from the Holocene. The area has been designated a PASSI. Fairy Cave has been speculated to be part of a previous series of passages of the main Reyfad system. There is a small passage that runs along the joints of the bedrock and is only 1 m in height, which terminates in a sump; beyond this is a silt- choked hole. = Ivy Hole = Grid ref: H10694635. The rocks of this sinkhole are of Knockmore Limestone. The hole is designated a PASSI and is one of a pair of dolines. A small stream flows into the sinkhole, which is estimated to be 10 m deep. It has been determined that the water from this hole emerges at Carrickbeg Rising. = Little Reyfad = Grid ref: H096465. The rocks of this sinkhole consist of Dartry Limestone, Knockmore Limestone and chert. The site has been designated a PASSI. Little Reyfad is at the base of a shakehole. A series of descents (7 m) leads to a floor of broken chert, followed by a further 3 metre difficult descent to another base, which is blocked with a rock and gravel. = Mad Pot = Grid ref: H09444666. The rocks of this sinkhole are composed of Dartry Limestone and Knockmore Limestone with inclusions of chert. The sinkhole originates in peat and then cuts into limestone rock. There are a series of chert base levels which have been broken up to give access to further passages. When the substrata changes into Knockmore Limestone, the character of the cave changes to a more vertically oriented passage. After some more climbing there is a 22 m vertical drop with a further crawl at the base, which leads to a completely flooded section or sump, which itself is completely blocked up with silt. Above this is a very high roofed chamber or aven. = Murphy's Hole = Grid ref: H10054613. The rocks of this formation date from the Quaternary (Holocene) period and consist of limestone. The area is designated a PASSI. Murphy's Hole is situated at the north end of a depression that also contains Seltanacool Sinks. A waterfall drains into the sink, which takes a large volume of water in heavy rains. Water draining here has been dye traced to the resurgence at Carrickbeg. = Oweyglass Caves = Grid ref: H100470. The substrata from this formation dates from the Quaternary (Holocene) era and is composed of limestone. Designated a PASSI, it is situated in a cliff of Knockmore Limestone. This cave is linked to a series of springs. The longest passage here is reported to be no more than . = Pollbeg = Grid ref: H11744557. The rocks from this sinkhole are of Carn and Dartry Limestones. The site is designated a PASSI. This hole floods in wet weather. = Pollkeeran = Grid ref: H11834513. Also known as Pollkerran, this sinkhole is designated a PASSI. The strata consist of Carn Limestone with mudstone and shale deposits. This formation is thought to have been a cave roof, which has collapsed, normally known as a shakehole. The debris from the collapse has formed what is known as a 'choke hole'. Investigations have determined that the stream which sinks into Pollkeeran rises again 2 km to the north at Carrickbeg Rising Cave. Extreme caution is advised as this sink is extremely dangerous and attempts to explore should only be undertaken by very experienced cavers. = Pollmore (Poll M√≥r)= Grid ref: H11654582. The rocks from this shakehole are of Carn Limestone. The shakehole contains two sinks and is surrounded by cliffs on three sides. In wet weather, the sinks flood and water up to 2 m deep can build up. It has been ascertained that the water from Pollmore emerges at Carrickbeg Rising. = Pollnacrom = Grid ref: H08534702. The rocks from this formation are composed of Dartry and Knockmore Limestones with chert and gypsum. This site has been designated a PASSI. This cave is part of the main Reyfad system that links to the 'Heaven and Hell' passage. It has a small, wet entrance. The cave contains two shafts at 50 and 15 m respectively, which permit entry to the main stream passage which trends in a north-west direction for before turning south. The cave has been explored for to an impassable sump. An attempt to force through this route in 1981 led to the death of a diver. Access is by permission of landowner only. = Polltullybrack = Grid ref: H09214672. (). The rocks in this second major entrance to the Reyfad system are composed of Dartry and Knockmore Limestones with chert and calcite formations. This cave is designated a PASSI. There is a very tight entrance to this cave through a sinkhole in what is known as a dry valley, but this eventually expands into a wider cave. The continuation of the passage contains many boulders and a deep pool, followed by 250 m of difficult passage which ends in a submerged section, through which cavers have to duck. A short distance beyond this there is a 53-metre shaft, which is the longest-known pitch of any Irish cave. The cave joins up with the Reyfad system just north of the main chamber. Just before this are chambers known as the 'Grottoes', which contain fine examples of calcite features including stalactites, helictites and cave curtains. Access is by permission of landowner only. = Rattle Hole = Grid ref: H10234633. The rocks from this pothole are limestone with some gravel. The site, located in moorland, has been designated a PASSI. Rattle Hole consists of a single shaft of depth, which terminates in a boulder strewn base. This provides access to a second chamber, which is a further deep and ends in a gravel base. Further efforts at extending this passage have proved fruitless, but as a result of dye testing it is known that the water from here emerges at Carrickbeg. = Reyfad Pot (Pota Raith Fada)= Grid ref: H08894687. The rocks from this formation comprise Carn and Dartry Limestones with some Glenade Sandstone. Breccia, chert, calcite and gypsum deposits can also be found. This cave is noted by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency as being the most important underground karst site in Northern Ireland. At deep and long, it is the deepest cave system in Ireland and the second-longest in Northern Ireland. This site is a PASSI and is a very active cave with many calcite formations and fossiliferous limestone, which includes evidence of Brachiopods and Crinoids. The extended area is hypothesised to have formed from the last glacial period (Pleistocene). Access is by permission of landowner only. = Seltanacool Sinks = Grid ref: H102458. (). The rocks from this line of three sinks date from the Quaternary (Holocene) and consist of limestone. It is thought that the sinks, which are situated in the same depression as Murphy's Hole, link to Carrickbeg Rising.  Knockmore  = Noon's Hole = = Arch Cave = Arch Cave, June 2009, The Baraghan, Boho Grid ref: H1037 4790. This cave is also known as Ooghboraghan. The rocks comprise Dartry Limestone, Glenade Sandstone, Glencar Limestone, Knockmore Limestone, Meenymore Formation. These are found together with breccia, chert, limestone, mudstone and calcite. = Aughakeeran Pot = Grid ref: H09344765. Also known as Pollaphylla or Pollasod, the rocks of this pothole comprise Dartry and Knockmore Limestones. The site is designated a PASSI. This sinkhole contains a substantial shaft of depth, with some crawling sections and short passages which ultimately end at an impenetrable crack in the rocks. The stream passing through Aughakeeran is believed to join the drainage through Pollanaffrin. = Crunthelagh Sink = Grid ref: H09374793. The rocks from this sinkhole comprise Dartry and Knockmore Limestones. The formation is designated a PASSI. The water flowing into this sink is thought to emerge into 'High Noon's' in the Noon's‚ÄìArch system. = Killydrum Sink = Grid ref: H09954771. = Lettered Cave (Inscribed Cave) = Grid ref H08845047. Situated 50 m from Knockmore summit, this is a small cave of mainly archaeological significance, and is partially man-made. The rocks in which it is formed is Knockmore Limestone. The cave is named for the art and writing of varying age inscribed on the walls. It was investigated by William Wakeman (1866‚Äì70) and Thomas Plunkett (1878 and 1898) and is now a scheduled ancient monument. The cave, described in the paper by Wakeman in 1868 as lying 'in the midst of a desolate, heath-clad highland, which extends over a considerable portion of northern Fermanagh, with no trace of cultivation, ancient or modern\\" . He also describes it as situated beside a lake four miles and a quarter to the west and north of the police station of Bohoe (Boho). = Old Barr Sink = Grid ref H09244844. The rocks from this formation comprise Dartry Limestone and Knockmore Limestone. The feature is designated as a PASSI. This sink is found in a forested area containing a small stream, which sinks in several places. The water from the stream is believed to enter 'Inlet 1' beside 'Artie's Chamber' in the Noon's‚ÄìArch system. = Pollanaffrin = Grid ref: H09354754. The rocks from this sinkhole comprise Dartry Limestone and Knockmore Limestone. The area is designated a PASSI. A large river enters this pot hole when there is much rain. The cave follows many twists and drops and is of considerable length before it terminates at an impasse. It has been speculated that the water from this system enters Noon's Hole. = Seltanahunny Sink = Grid ref: H08964860. This sink forms part of the Noon's Hole‚ÄìArch Cave complex and the rock in which it is formed comprises Dartry Limestone and Knockmore Limestone. The site, which is designated a PASSI, features a narrow bedding plane leading for 12 m to a waterfall and a duck. It has been speculated that the water from this sink also joins the Noon's Hole drainage system.

The petroglyphs are dated from 4,200 BC to 500 BC, based on old shorelines and nearby prehistoric settlements. =World War II= During World War II there was a German naval base along the K√•fjorden, which branches off the main Altafjord. The German battleship Tirpitz was based at the village of K√•fjord (along the K√•fjorden). It was subject to attacks by British X class midget submarines in September 1943 (Operation Source), and in 1944 to air strikes in April (Operation Tungsten), July (Operation Mascot), August (Operation Goodwood), and September (Operation Paravane), after which Tirpitz was relocated to Troms√∏, where a final bombing raid in November (Operation Catechism) sank the battleship.

Chee was born on 19 May 1920 in a village near Putian, Fujian, China. The son of You Yuan, a Fujianese merchant; Grandmaster Chee Kim Thong's apprenticeship to Chinese martial arts began as a child. His natural ability, combined with a family tradition ‚Äì his grandmother was a recognised master of Monkey Boxing (Hou Quan)  of excelling in the martial arts, prepared him well for the winning of many titles in provincial tournaments (which took the form of traditional Lei Tai contests). Chee Kim Thong is a central figure in Chris Murray's memoir Crippled Immortals.

By the time he completed his studies under the former Abbot, the Second Sino-Japanese War had engulfed Fujian: due to his renown as an exceptional pugilist, Grandmaster Chee played an important part in fighting against the Japanese invaders, becoming the leader of the patriot guerrilla force known as The Big Knife Army.http://cheekimthong.com/ckt_departure.html Eventually forced to flee mainland China, he took refuge in Malaysia and Singapore, where he was for a time a captive of the invasion forces; escaping however, he remained in hiding until the Japanese forces capitulated. After the conflict, Grandmaster Chee Kim Thong deliberately concealed his identity and his martial arts background, instead becoming increasingly known in Malaysia for his work as a very successful healer and bone-setter: bone-setting was one of the medical skills that authentic traditional Chinese martial arts that masters of his generation possessed. Grandmaster Chee's martial arts prowess was publicly revealed when, whilst working as a bus conductor, he defended the bus driver from a mob of angry villagers wielding parangs (a type of sword) whilst unarmed. His reputation soon spread until Mr Yap Cheng Hai of Singapore (who would become Grandmaster Chee's first disciple) travelled to meet him and implored him to resume his teaching of the martial arts. When he eventually came out of his self-imposed retirement, he divided his time between his business, training others in the martial arts of his renowned lineage ‚Äì including the recognised fact that he represented the most pure and direct Five Ancestors lineage ‚Äì and extensive work as a nationally renowned doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, with surgeries in various locations across Malaysia. Benefactor of various charitable works, which included contributing towards the reconstruction of the Southern Shaolin Temple at Putian, Fujian. His international educational work to assist the preservation and teaching of the arts of his famous lineage formed a particularly important activity during the latter years of his life; he was accorded the title of ‚ÄòLiving National Treasure of the People‚Äôs Republic of China‚Äô in 1989. A staunch defender of the traditional concept that ancient arts and systems should not be altered, he taught the perspective that traditional Shaolin boxing is first and foremost a method of training and developing character and spiritual development.http://www.learnkungfuinchina.com/spiritofgongfu1.html In 1995, Grandmaster Chee Kim Thong was awarded the honorific title of ‚Äòdato/datuk‚Äôhttp://cheekimthong.com/ckt_start.html [Malaysian equivalent of the English ‚Äòknighthood‚Äô] as an acknowledgment of his exceptional medical expertise in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine which he put to the benefit of many. It was for this reason that his name came to the attention of the Sultan of Terrengganu, whom he personally assisted to regain good health after illness. Grandmaster Chee Kim Thong died on 12 April 2001, leaving a legacy that endures internationally through the traditionalhttp://cheekimthong.com/ckt_notes1.html teachings he passed to his disciples and many students. He realised that in modern times his disciples would not have the background of the traditional Shaolin training, so he decided that to teach each of his disciples a style that was best suited to the individual's character and ability, in order to develop the individual style bestowed by him on them. In this way he was able to pass on and protect the arts of his lineage collectively through his disciples rather than any sole individual as traditionally would have been the case in earlier times.

He had also a particular interest in the history of dogma. Batiffol studied from 1878 at the priest seminary Saint-Sulpice in Paris, was ordained in 1884 and continued his studies at the Institut catholique in Paris and at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes. He was taught by church historian Louis Marie Olivier Duchesne. Under Giovanni Battista de Rossi in Rome, he studied from 1887 to 1889 the archaeology, research and liturgical antique Christian literature. From 1889 to 1898 and from 1907 until 1929, he lectured at Ecole Sainte-Barbe in Paris. Together with his friend Marie-Joseph Lagrange OP, Batiffol founded in 1892 the magazine \\"Revue Biblique\\" for the historical- critical method of exegesis of the Old and New Testament. In 1899 he founded the \\"Bulletin de litt√©rature eccl√©siastique\\". In 1898 he became the head of the Institut catholique in Toulouse. He used historical criticism method in his theological research. He applied strict critical method while studying the Church dogma and history as well as manuscripts of the Holy Scripture. He lost his chair in the Institute in the aftermath of the publication of Pascendi dominici gregis (8 September 1907) encyclical of Pope Pius X.Cf. the text of Pascendi dominici gregis encyclical. That was due particularly to his book on the Eucharist (1905) being put on Index librorum prohibitorum and his affinity to the historical criticism method. He was considered falling into the Catholic modernism. Batiffol examined Codex Beratinus, Beratinus II, Codex Curiensis, and several other manuscripts.

Two versions were designed; one with flaps, retractable main-wheel and provision for water ballast named Sport, and one with fixed undercarriage covered by a fairing, called Sprite. Construction of the Torva 15 gliders was of glassfibre with foam filling and plywood frames ribs and reinforcement. The specially modified Wortmann aerofoil section endowed the Torva 15's with good climb performance in typical British weak thermals and reduced the stalling speed to allow easy field landings. The smooth lines of the fuselage were unbroken by the one-piece canopy, which hinged to the side to allow easy access to the comfortable cockpit, with the tail section, integral with the rear fuselage, supporting a cruciform style tail assembly. Large airbrakes in the wings allowed for accurate landings and approach control as well as limiting the maximum speed attainable. The first flight of the Torva 15 Sport, piloted by Chris Riddell, was on 8 May 1971. The Torva company was closed before production could start and the two prototypes were acquired by Chris Riddell.

The Imperial Refuge Wilderness, a federally designated, , wilderness area is protected within the refuge. It also surrounds the Picacho State Recreation Area. This section of the Colorado River is popular for boating, hiking, fishing, camping, exploring old mining camps and wildlife watching. The river and its associated backwater lakes and wetlands are a green oasis, contrasting with the surrounding desert mountains. It is a refuge and breeding area for migratory birds and local desert wildlife. Wildlife Even though it is located in the Sonoran Desert, the Imperial National Wildlife Refuge is home to a mostly wetland environment. Wetland wildlife is most abundant in winter, when birds such as cinnamon teal and northern pintail use the refuge. During the summer months, permanent residents such as great egrets are abundant. The Colorado River plays a vital role in the lives of desert fauna. It is the only water source for many miles. Small animals such as the black-tailed jackrabbit and western whiptail lizard are plentiful. Desert bighorn sheep and mule deer also call the refuge home. =Birds= *Common loon * Western grebe * Blue-footed booby * Brown booby * American white pelican * Brown pelican * Double-crested cormorant * Great blue heron * Great egret * Snowy egret * Wood stork * Canada goose * Wood duck * Mallard * Northern pintail * Cinnamon teal * Turkey vulture * Osprey * Bald eagle * Red-tailed hawk * American kestrel * Peregrine falcon * Gambel's quail * Sandhill crane * Killdeer * California gull * Common tern * Mourning dove * Common ground-dove * Yellow-billed cuckoo * Greater roadrunner * Barn owl * Great horned owl * Burrowing owl * White-throated swift * Hummingbird * Belted kingfisher * Gila woodpecker * Tree swallow * Barn swallow * Woodhouse's scrub jay * Common raven * Brown creeper * Cactus wren * Marsh wren * Northern mockingbird * House finch A full list of birds found on the refuge can be found on the refuge website. =Forest in the Desert= At one time, the banks of the Colorado River were lined with cottonwood and willow forests, sustained by the river‚Äôs natural periodic flooding. Animals depended on this green forest oasis for breeding, resting, feeding, and shade. Woodcutting during the steamboat era, clearing for agriculture, wild fire, exotic plants like salt cedar, and use of dams for flood prevention have devastated cottonwood and willow stands along the lower Colorado River. Some animals that depended the riparian forests, such as the southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus), have become endangered. Trails The Painted Desert Trail is a 1.3-mile self-guided trail for an opportunity to see desert plants and wildlife. The trail takes you through a rainbow of colors left by 30,000-year- old volcanic activity and features a panoramic view of the Colorado River valley.

She was also the first sworn female officer of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) to have been killed in the line of duty. Early life and education Cobb Cobb Cobb was born in Washington, D.C., on August 17, 1950, the second of five children, and grew up at a row house near the intersection of 14th and D Streets in Northeast, Washington, D.C. Cobb's family moved to Washington, D.C., in the 1930s. Her father was Clinton Cobb, a correctional officer for the District of Columbia who tried to apply to the MPDC in 1953, but was rejected due to being shorter than five feet and eight inches tall. Cobb's mother was Gloria Cobb, a crossing guard at Kingsman Elementary School, who met Cobb's father at Cardoza High School. Cobb's sister, Denise, ultimately went on to become a schoolteacher. As a child, Cobb attended Catholic schools and was described as an average, but creative and energetic student. She attended Elliot Jr. High School, Eastern High School, and the now-defunct St. Cecilia's Academy. Upon graduating St. Cecila's Academy in 1969, Cobb wanted to become a successful fashion designer. However, she had little means and knowledge on how to go about doing so and ended up becoming a long-distance operator at the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company. Personal life Cobb, a single mother, gave birth to a son, Damon Demetrius Cobb, on February 26, 1970. Her son's father, whom Cobb had met in high school, took no responsibility for his son, and Cobb ended up trying to raise him on her own. Cobb's son is currently serving a life sentence in prison at the Western Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, after being found guilty of first-degree murder in a 1992 killing. Cobb's parents stated in 1996 that they believed that her untimely murder influenced her son's current legal predicament at the time. Career In October 1973, Cobb applied to become an officer with the MPDC, much to the surprise of her family and friends, after the Washington, D.C., government lowered the height requirements for police recruits to five feet. Cobb herself was five feet tall, and graduated from her 34-member police academy class in April 1974, of which 13 members were female. She was well-liked by her trainers, who noted that she was hard-working. She spent most of her patrol work on foot and signed up for training to get a scooter license and was taking a night class to learn sign language. Death Late in the morning of Friday, September 20, 1974, around 10:30 am, two men, John Curtis Dortch, a 29-year-old Howard University graduate and former U.S. Army soldier from Silver Spring, Maryland, and John William Bryant, a 24-year-old man from Washington, D.C., began making their way to the Eastern Liberty Federal Savings and Loan bank at 21st and L Streets NW, disguised as construction workers, and each carrying a loaded sawed-off shotgun and handgun. They intended to rob the bank. Two plainclothes police officers were alerted of the robbery in advance, and saw the two men on the street. The officers stopped them and asked them for identification, before the would-be robbers could even get inside the bank. The two men ran off in separate directions. Cobb was still on probationary duty six months out of the academy and was assigned to foot patrol duty downtown, a block away from the bank. Cobb, who was writing a traffic ticket at the time, was told by a citizen that they saw an armed man run into a garage. Cobb followed the suspect and confronted him inside the garage as he was in the process of changing out of his disguise. Cobb ordered the man to place his hands on the wall. As she called for assistance over her radio, the suspect spun around and fired a single gunshot at Cobb at close range. The bullet went through Cobb's wrist, shattering a wristwatch that was given to her by her mother as a birthday present, continued through her police radio, where it then penetrated her heart. Cobb died at the scene at 20th Street and L Street, NW, and responding officers arrested the suspect at the scene. Cobb had served with the MPDC for one year and was the first female MPDC officer to be killed in the line of duty, as well as the first African American female law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty in the United States. She is survived by her son, Damon Demetrius Cobb, and is buried at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland, near the border between Washington, D.C., and Prince George's County, Maryland. =Funeral= Cobb's casket being carried by pallbearers at her funeral in 1974 Cobb's funeral was ornate and large, even by Washington, D.C.'s standards. The streets leading to Holy Comforter Catholic Church in Southeast, Washington, D.C., were lined with hundreds of police officers, some coming all the way from Hawaii, all standing at attention. A police honor guard made several passes along East Capitol Street before entering the church. Delegations of uniformed officers filed past Cobb's open casket. Cobb was not buried in uniform; instead, she was wearing a green pantsuit. Her best friend had styled her hair, applied her favorite makeup, and put in gold hoop earrings. The Mayor of the District of Columbia, Walter Washington, and FBI Director Clarence Kelley were among the many U.S. government officials who attended the crowded service on Tuesday, September 24, 1974. At the hour of the funeral, U.S. President Gerald R. Ford called for a moment of silence as he addressed an International Association of Police Chiefs conference being held across town. Legacy Several weeks after Cobb's funeral, her parents purchased a glass curio cabinet in which to house memorabilia regarding their daughter. They displayed a photograph of Cobb in her MPDC uniform, her police badge, along with a 45 rpm copy of her favorite song, \\"Tell Her Love Has Felt the Need\\", by Eddie Kendricks and the Young Senators, which had been sung at her funeral, along with proclamations and letters from government officials, and the uniform boots that Cobb had been wearing when she died. Given an entire section all to its own was a letter from U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, saying that Cobb \\"has our lasting admiration for the cause of law enforcement and the well-being of our society, a cause for which she made the highest sacrifice.\\" In 1975, John William Bryant was sentenced to 15 years to life imprisonment after being found guilty by a jury of second-degree murder. He was released on parole in 1992. The following year, in November 1993, he was arrested in Washington, D.C., for possessing crack cocaine and three bags of marijuana. However, a court ruled the cocaine and marijuana impermissible in court as the arresting officers did not have probable cause to believe that Bryant was committing a crime when they discovered them. In July 1997, the D.C. Parole Board revoked Bryant's parole for his possessing marijuana and cocaine, as well as testing positive for marijuana use. Bryant denied ever using marijuana. The D.C. Parole Board decided not to send Bryant back to prison, but rather to send him to an inpatient program for alcoholism treatment, much to the dismay of Cobb's relatives. In 1996, John Curtis Dortch (born July 19, 1945), who was one of the key architects of the robbery that left Cobb dead, attempted to become a lawyer in West Virginia and Washington, D.C., after finishing a 15-year prison term for his being convicted of second-degree murder on July 30, 1975. After being released from prison on parole in 1989 for \\"good behavior\\", Dortch became active in church, helped out an AIDS patient, began tutoring and mentoring children, and started attending law school. Dortch, a graduate of Howard University and a former U.S. Army officer who served in the Vietnam War, was not the triggerman who shot Cobb, however, he attempted to appeal to the courts to allow him to become a lawyer, much to the dismay of Cobb's family and friends. In 1997, the West Virginia Supreme Court denied Dortch permission to practice law in the state in a unanimous 4-0 decision, to the praise of Cobb's surviving family members and friends. Dortch has since written an autobiography of his life, Memoirs of the Prodigal Son: the Road to Redemption, Fifteen Years in Prison and Beyond, released in September 2008.

Several players from the South Africa national rugby union team have joined the IRB and International Hall of Fame. Individual records = Career = Percy Montgomery holds the South African record for Test points South Africa's most capped player is Victor Matfield with 127 caps. Matfield is the most-capped lock for any nation in rugby history, with all of his 127 appearances at that position. The most-capped back is Bryan Habana, with 124 caps over a thirteen year career. Percy Montgomery holds the South African record for Test points with 893, which at the time of his international retirement placed him sixth on the all-time list of Test point scorers (he now stands eleventh).(as at 10 December 2019) Morn√© Steyn holds the Springbok record for the fastest 100 points (8 Test matches) Although statistics on the success rate of kicks at goal were not kept until the late 1980s, it is believed that Steyn also holds the record for most consecutive successful kicks at goal in Tests. He had a streak of 41 successful kicks at goal, which started during the Boks' Test against Italy on 19 June 2010 and ended on 6 November 2010 against Ireland. John Smit was the world's most-capped captain, having has captained South Africa in 82 of his 111 Tests.Springbok milestone watch Sport24, 24 August 2010 He has since been overtaken by Richie McCaw and Brian O'Driscoll. The world's most-capped lock pairing is that of Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha, who have started together in 62 Tests. At the time of the article, Matfield and Botha had started together in 60 Tests. They started together in the Boks' next Test on 19 June against Italy, but not in the two teams' 26 June Test, and next started together against Ireland on 6 November 2010. Smit also played 46 consecutive matches for South Africa, which is a record. The record try scorer is Bryan Habana with 67 international tries.(as at 14 February 2018) =Single match= John Smit, the Springbok player in most consecutive test matches retired end 2011 Fly-half Jannie de Beer holds the world record for dropped goals in a Test match (5, during the 44‚Äì21 quarter-final win over England in the 1999 Rugby World Cup) The most points Montgomery ever scored in a single international was 35 against Namibia in 2007‚Äîthis is also a South African record. On 1 August during the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, Morn√© Steyn set a number of records during the second Test between the Springboks and the All Blacks. The Springboks won 31‚Äì19, with Steyn scoring all South Africa's points ‚Äì 1 try, 1 conversion, 8 penalties. This gave him records for: *Most points scored by any player in a Tri Nations match, surpassing Andrew Mehrtens (All Blacks vs. Australia, 1999). *Most points ever scored by an individual in a Test against the All Blacks, passing Christophe Lamaison's 29 (France, 1999). *World record for most points scored by a player who has scored all their team's points. *South African record for penalties in a test (8) ‚Äì beating the seven achieved twice by Montgomery. Hall of Fame players Eleven former South African international players have been inducted into either the International Rugby Hall of Fame or the IRB Hall of Fame. Six are members of the International Rugby Hall of Fame only; two are members of the IRB Hall of Fame only, and four are members of both Halls of Fame. Barry \\"Fairy\\" Heatlie, who played in the late 19th century and into the early 20th, was one of the early greats of South African rugby. He appeared for Western Province 34 times between 1890 and 1904, with 28 of them being Currie Cup wins. He also played six Tests for South Africa against the Lions in 1891, 1896, and 1903, and also captained the side to their only two Test wins of the 1890s. Arguably his greatest legacy to South African rugby is the green jersey; he is credited with introducing the colour for South Africa's 1903 Test against the Lions at Newlands. He was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009. Bennie Osler played 17 consecutive Tests between 1924 and 1933. Playing at fly-half, his first Test was against the touring British team in 1924. He also played in the series against the All Blacks in 1928, but most notably captained the Springboks on their Grand Slam tour of 1931‚Äì32 when they defeated all four Home Nations. His last Tests were the five played against Australia when they toured to South Africa in 1933. Osler was inducted to the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2007 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009. Making his Test debut in Olser's Grand Slam winning team in 1931 was scrum-half Danie Craven. Craven played several positions including fly-half, scrum-half, centre and even number-eight. However Craven was most famous for popularising the dive pass.Harding (2000), pg 35 As well as winning a Grand Slam with Osler's team, Craven toured with 1937 Springboks to New Zealand where they achieved their first series victory over New Zealand. His last act as player was captaining South Africa in a Test series against the Lions. Craven's involvement with the Springboks continued after his playing retirement, and he coached them to a 4‚Äì0 series win over the touring All Blacks in 1949.Harding (2000), pg 42 He was elected President of the South African Rugby Board in 1956, a position he held until the post-apartheid South African Rugby Union was formed in 1991. Craven was instrumental in the formation of the South African Rugby Union and became its first Executive President. Such was Craven's influence in South African rugby he became known as \\"Mr Rugby\\", was inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1997, and was in the second class of inductees into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2007; behind Rugby School and William Webb Ellis. The man most credited with inventing modern number 8 play was Hennie Muller, inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 2001. He played 13 Tests between 1949 and 1953, and in the process won a 4‚Äì0 series victory over the All Blacks and a Grand Slam tour of Britain and Ireland. He was nicknamed Windhond (greyhound) for his speed around the field. When writing about the 1949 series against the All Blacks, Harding and Williams wrote: \\"(Okey) Geffin won the series, perhaps, but Muller made it possible.\\"Harding (2000), pg 50 Of Muller's 13 Tests, he only lost one‚Äîagainst Australia in 1953. Named South Africa's player of the 20th Century in 2000, Frik du Preez played 38 Tests between 1961 and 1971. Du Preez could play both flanker or lock and was one of the most dominant forwards of the 1960s, but was especially well known for his all round skills. Danie Craven said of du Preez, \\"To my mind he could have played any position on a rugby field with equal brilliance.\\" He was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009. Morne du Plessis played 22 Tests for South Africa between 1971 and 1980. His debut was at Number 8 in South Africa's series win over Australia in 1971. He went on to captain South Africa and became part of the only father-son pair to captain South Africa‚Äîhis father had captained South Africa in 1949. He led South Africa to a 3‚Äì1 series win over the All Blacks in 1976 and a series win over the British and Irish Lions in 1980 by the same margin. Du Plessis would be inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1999. International Hall of Fame inductees Naas Botha, inducted in 2005, and Danie Gerber, inducted in 2007, both had careers interrupted by South Africa's sporting isolation in the 1980s and early 1990s. Botha made his Test debut against the South American Jaguars in 1980. Playing at fly-half, Botha played 28 Tests and scored 312 Test points before his international retirement in 1992. Botha contributed significantly to the Springboks 1980 series win over the Lions, and also played for the World XV in the IRB Centenary Match at Twickenham. Gerber also made his debut in 1980, and scored 19 tries in his 24 Tests before retiring in 1992. He scored a hat-trick against England in 1984, and played alongside Botha in the World XV team in 1986. In South Africa's first Test since the fall of apartheid, against the All Blacks in 1992, he scored twice. Two players that straddled the amateur and professional eras were Francois Pienaar and Joost van der Westhuizen. Both first played for the Springboks in 1993. Pienaar was named captain in his first Test against France, and went on to captain the side to the 1995 World Cup. It was there he captained South Africa to the World Cup title, and received the trophy from Nelson Mandela who was wearing his number 6 jersey. Nelson Mandela later wrote \\"It was under Francois Pienaar's inspiring leadership that rugby became the pride of the entire country. Francois brought the nation together.\\" Pienaar entered the International Hall of Fame in 2005, and was inducted into the IRB Hall in 2011 alongside all other World Cup- winning captains from the inaugural event in 1987 through 2007 (minus the previously inducted Australian John Eales). Joost van der Westhuizen also participated in the 1995 World cup victory, but went on to play in two more World Cups. Playing at scrum-half, van der Westhuizen played 89 Tests for South Africa and scored 38 tries. At the time of his retirement following the 2003 World Cup he was South Africa's leading try scorer and most capped player. He entered the International Hall of Fame two years after Pienaar, in 2007. The newest Springbok player to enter the IRB Hall is John Smit, inducted in 2011 alongside Pienaar. The captain of the 2007 World Cup winners, Smit (as noted earlier) ended his international career as the most-capped Springbok in history.

The British and French sent a squadron of gunboats, under Rear-Admiral Admiral Michael Seymour, to attack China's Taku Forts. The battle ended as an allied success. However, the first phase of the Second Opium War would end with the Treaties of Tianjin and the forts were returned to the hands of the Qing Army, leading to the Second Battle of Taku Forts in 1859.  Background  After the outbreak of the Second Opium War, the Anglo-French alliance captured the significant harbor of Canton (Guangzhou) during the Battle of Canton in 1857. The Xianfeng Emperor received the news that Canton had been occupied on 27 January 1858. The British commander Michael Seymour, hoping to force a settlement (the later Treaty of Tianjin), ordered an attack on the Taku Forts as they were the closer path towards Peking.

Biography He was born in Westerheim, Baden-W√ºrttemberg and after trade school he worked as a construction technician. He joined the SS on 1 February 1930. On 29 February 1932, the SS- Begleitkommando was formed to provide general protection for Hitler. Sch√§dle was one of twelve SS members selected by Sepp Dietrich to present to Hitler for the unit. From the twelve, a smaller eight-man team called the SS- Begleitkommando des F√ºhrers (SS Escort Command of the F√ºhrer; SS-BKdF) was chosen to protect Hitler as he travelled outside Munich and the borders of Bavaria, Germany. As a member of the unit, Sch√§dle guarded Hitler at the various F√ºhrer Headquarters and accompanied him on all his trips. He also served on the staff of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler from 1 May 1934. On 5 January 1945, Sch√§dle was appointed commander of the bodyguard unit after the dismissal of Bruno Gesche. By then, the SS-Begleitkommando had been expanded and was known as the F√ºhrerbegleitkommando (F√ºhrer Escort Command; FBK). He accompanied Hitler and his entourage into the bunker complex under the Reich Chancellery garden in the central government sector of Berlin. Sch√§dle appointed FBK member Oberscharf√ºhrer Rochus Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. By 23 April 1945, Sch√§dle commanded approximately 30 members in the unit who stood guard for Hitler. On 28 April 1945, Sch√§dle was wounded in the leg by shrapnel, which caused him to have to \\"hobble\\" around using a crutch. After Hitler committed suicide on the afternoon of 30 April, Sch√§dle was present at Hitler's cremation in the garden of the Reich Chancellery. Thereafter, orders were issued that those who could do so were to break out. The plan was to escape from Berlin to surrender to the Western Allies on the Elbe or join the German Army to the North. Those left in the Reich Chancellery and F√ºhrerbunker were split up into ten main groups. Rochus Misch stated that Sch√§dle had ordered, that when the time came, he was to join SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Wilhelm Mohnke's lead break-out group. Misch later recalled that shortly thereafter, four fellow FBK guards came down into the F√ºhrerbunker carrying an empty stretcher. They wanted to carry Sch√§dle on it during the break-out. Sch√§dle turned them down. According to the bunker's master electro-mechanic Johannes Hentschel, by that time Sch√§dle's leg wound had become gangrenous. Prior to his suicide, Joseph Goebbels finally released Misch from further service as the bunker telephone operator; he was free to leave. By then, Misch and mechanic Hentschel were two of the last people remaining in the bunker. Misch went upstairs, through the cellars of the Reich Chancellery to where Sch√§dle had his office to report one last time. Misch told Sch√§dle that Goebbels had released him. Sch√§dle told Misch of the route he should take to try to get through the Soviet encirclement of the area. Thereafter, Sch√§dle committed suicide by shooting himself in the mouth with a pistol, rather than attempt the break out from the Chancellery to escape from the advancing Red Army. He did not want to endanger the lives of the others in the attempt given the fact he could only walk at a slow pace using a crutch.

The Usonian style house was constructed along the banks of the Wapsipinicon River near Quasqueton, Iowa, in 1950. Following Lowell Walter's death in 1981, the home was donated to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and opened to the public for tours. The Walter House at Cedar Rock is one of Frank Lloyd Wright's most complete signature designs. Nearly everything at Cedar Rock bears the architect's imprint. Wright designed the furniture, chose the draperies, and even picked out the accessories. Background The house's living room Cedar Rock is an important example of the Midwestern residential style created by Wright, characterized by its provisions for living simply and in harmony with nature. The Walter Residence is an example of a simplified style Wright called ‚ÄúUsonian.‚Äù These designs were typically created as a single story with zoned areas for living. Wright accomplished this by designing this home in a ‚Äútadpole‚Äù shape. Today, the Friends of Cedar Rock strive to preserve this unique and important architectural masterpiece. Contributions from visitors help support their education, restoration and preservation programs, and ensure that Lowell and Agnes Walter's home will continue to engage and inspire visitors for generations to come.

The estate is owned by the village and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The mansion consists of 52 rooms and has 12 fireplaces. It occupies a site about one-quarter mile north of Newark- Granville Road, and one mile directly east of the village of Granville. History Local businessman Henry D. Wright originally constructed the mansion on this site as an Italianate Villa type structure in 1865. The outside of the building was made from sandstone quarried from the property. The villa had a central three-story tower flanked by two wings. The third story of the tower had three arched openings on each side and an arched central entrance facing the south. Jonas McCune became the owner within a year after construction and the property became known as McCune's Villa. Several others owned the property prior to John Sutphin Jones, a coal and railroad magnate, who purchased the property in 1905. Jones soon hired Frank Packard, a well known Columbus architect, to orchestrate the renovation of the mansion. The project took nearly five years and transformed the mansion into its Georgian-Federal style design. Among other renovations, Packard added the wings, increasing the width of the house from 100 to 140 feet, as well as the great Federal style portico on the south wall of the tower. The additions to the mansion were made from the same quarry stone as the original. Packard also constructed the outbuildings: the carriage house, the laundry house, and the horse barn. The interior of the mansion has a combination of Federal and Georgian motifs. The decorative plaster ceilings are in the Adams (Federal- McIntire) manner. Etymology Jones named the estate ‚ÄúBryn Du,‚Äù which means Black Hills in Welsh, honoring his ancestral background and the area full of coal in which he made his fortune, namely southern Ohio. Jones' occupancy Jones' \\"town house\\" being Monomoy Place, currently the home of the presidents of Denison University, Jones bought and renovated the McCune's Villa to serve as the country house for his first wife Sarah Fidelia Follett (\\"Sally\\") Jones. Unfortunately, Sally died in 1910, just as the renovations were being completed. Jones then remarried 1 August 1911, and lived in the mansion with his second wife, Alice Baxter Bartlett Jones, and their two daughters, Sallie and Alice. During the Jones‚Äô occupancy, dinner was served to Calvin Coolidge, William Howard Taft and Warren G. Harding at the Mansion. Lillian Gish and Katharine Cornell sipped coffee and Paderewski and Rachmaninoff played the Steinway. Jones died in 1927 and his elder daughter, Sallie Jones Sexton, inherited the property, living on the estate while managing the farm and the Granville Inn. Sallie became a local legend, famous for breeding and training show horses, and for her vivid personality and colorful language. Sallie's storied management style led the estate into bankruptcy. William M. and Ortha A. Wright (no relation to the original Wright owners) purchased the property in 1979 and renovated the mansion into a restaurant for a brief time. Quest International purchased the property in 1989 for their company headquarters. Longaberger era Dave Longaberger purchased the estate in 1995. Longaberger constructed the game courts and field house facilities and began a major renovation project of the existing buildings, which halted at the time of his death in 1999. Today An advisory election was held in November 2002 in the Village of Granville to determine public opinion regarding the purchase of the property. Sixty two percent of the voters in the Village of Granville supported the property purchase. The Village purchased the property on December 16, 2002 from the Longaberger Company. The Village conveyed ownership of half of the front field (16.12 acres) to the Granville Township for green space preservation.

The UAE is currently home to 500,000 Iranian expatriates, most of whom live in Dubai. The Iranian Club in Dubai is the main social club of Iranian expatriates in the country. The Iranian population in UAE also includes small communities of Baloch people and Khuzestani Arabs. Business and organisations Iranian mosque in Dubai. There are an estimated 8,000 Iranian-backed businesses in Dubai. There is an Iranian Business Council - Dubai. There is also an Iranian Hospital in Dubai. Iran maintains a consulate-general in Dubai. The Iranian businesses in UAE own more than $ 300 billion there.https://uwidata.com/3493-gulf-cooperation-council-summit-what-does-it- have-in-store-for-iran/ Religion There are two notable Iranian mosques: the Iranian Mosque in Bur Dubai and the Iranian Mosque in Satwa.

Sundarrajan starring Mohan, Radha and Amala. This movie was a box office superhit. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by M. S. Viswanathan and Ilaiyaraaja together as per the credits, however the song tunes were composed by M.S.Vishwanathan and orchestra arrangements were by Ilaiyayraja. Entire background score was by M.S.Vishwanathan and orchestration for all the songs was done by Ilaiyaraaja.  Plot  Tulasi is a village girl. One day, she gets a letter from her cousin Subramani. She gets excited as they were close friends in childhood, but Subramani leaves with his family to the city. Subramani visits the village for his college thesis about folk songs. Tulasi is in love with Subramani, but she is confused whether Subramani also loves her. Tulasi's father dies due to a heart attack. When Subramani's father arranges a marriage for Subramani with Tulasi, he refuses. Because of this, Tulasi's mother dies in frustration. Then, Tulasi moves in to her uncle's house. Later, a flashback comes in which Subramani is in love with Noorjahan, a student in his college. Since Noorjahan used to come to the college wearing a veil, Subramani has not seen her face. On a day when they plan to meet, Noorjahan accidentally steps into quicksand and dies. Subramani feels dejected after seeing Noorjahan's death and decides to remain unmarried and that is the real reason for him to avoid marrying Tulasi. Tulasi decides to end her life as Subramani shows no interest in marrying her and she goes to the same place where Noorjahan died. Tulasi steps into the same quicksand, but Subramani rushes and saves Tulasi, having understood Tulasi's true love towards him.  Cast  * Mohan as Subramani * Radha as Tulasi *Amala as Noorjahan * Visu as Manickam Gounder * Senthil as Manickam Gounder's auction assistant * M. N. Nambiar as Noorjahan's father * Charle as Subramani's friend *Gundu Kalyanam as Subramani's friend * G. K. Venkatesh as Mohan's father  Production  Mella Thirandhathu Kadhavu was Mohan's first film with AVM Productions. When AVM came to know that M. S. Viswanathan was by 1986, having lesser films in hand, they decided to make this film and have him as music director along-with Ilaiyaraja. M. S. Viswanathan also agreed to compose the music alongside Ilaiyaraja.  Music  Except \\"Dil Dil Dil Manadhil\\" and \\"Ooru Sanam\\", all the songs were composed by M. S. Viswanathan and the arrangements, orchestration and background score were done by Ilaiyaraaja. The song \\"Vaa Vennila\\" is inspired from another Viswanathan composition \\"Vaan Meedhile\\" from the 1953 film Chandirani. Ilaiyaraaja later used \\"Kuzhaloodum Kannanukku\\" in Hindi as \\"Baatein Hawa Hain Saare\\" for Cheeni Kum (2007).  Release  Mella Thirandhathu Kadhavu was released on 12 September 1986. The film initially opened to average response but later picked up in coming weeks. When the film got released in Cinepriya theatre in Madurai, a distributor released the film by reversing the two halves of the film which enjoyed positive reception. Later all over Tamil Nadu the film was filmed by changing the two halves of the film which shows Amala story in first half and Radha story in second half. The response prompted producers to apply re-censorship for the film.

It is evidence that a written vernacular encouraged by the Church had already been established alongside Latin by the 7th century in Ireland. The homily is also the oldest single example of an extended prose passage in Old Irish.D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, \\"Hiberno-Latin Literature to 1169,\\" and James Carney, \\"Language and Literature to 1168,\\" in A New History of Ireland (Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 379 and 492. The text is incomplete, and Latin and Irish are mixed. Quotations from the Bible and patristic sources are in Latin, with the explication in Irish. It is a significant document for the study of Celtic linguistics and for understanding sermons as they might have existed in the 7th-century Irish church. The homily also contains the earliest examples in written Irish of triads, a form of expression characteristic of early Irish literature, though the text taken as a whole is not composed in triads.Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia, edited by Se√°n Duffy (Routledge, 2005), p. 452. The homily expounds on with a selection from the Homilia in Evangelia by Pope Gregory I and an explanation of three modes of martyrdom, designated by the colors red, blue (or green, Irish glas), and white.Westley Follett, C√©li D√© in Ireland: Monastic Writing and Identity in the Early Middle Ages (Boydell Press, 2006), pp. 54‚Äì56 online. Linguistic significance The Cambrai Homily, in reference to the French town Cambrai where it is kept at the municipal library, is one of the few surviving written sources for Old Irish in the period 700 to 900.Others are the Book of Armagh and the three main collections of glosses on Latin biblical and grammatical texts: the W√ºrzburg glosses on the epistles of Paul, the Milan glosses on a commentary to the Psalms, and the St. Gall glosses on Priscian. See Early Irish literature: The Old Irish glosses. As such, it was an important source for Rudolf Thurneysen's classic grammar of Old Irish. It exhibits some distinctive orthographical features; for instance, a long vowel is sometimes indicated in the manuscript not with a diacritical mark, but by doubling or writing out the vowel twice.Paul Russell, \\" 'What Was Best of Every Language': The Early History of the Irish Language,\\" in A New History of Ireland, p. 412; p. 417 for some variants the Cambrai Homily exhibits; p. 418 on vowel doubling. See also Gear√≥id Mac Eoin, \\"Literacy and Cultural Change in Early Ireland,\\" in Verschriftung und Verschriftlichung: Aspekte des Medienwechsels in verschiedenen Kulturen und Epochen (Gunter Narr Verlag, 1998), p. 114 online. However, it was clearly transcribed by someone who did not know any Irish and it contains, in Thurneysen's words, \\"every misreading which the Irish script could suggest\\". The edition published in Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus (vol. II, pp. 244 ff.) contains both the text as it appears in the manuscript and a restoration of what the editors believe to be the correct text. Penitence and suffering The passage from Matthew is addressed by Jesus to his disciples, calling upon each of them to follow his example and \\"take up his cross.\\" The homily takes an inclusive view of penitence as combining self- mortification with compassion for others: Christ is to be regarded as a model not only of meaningful suffering, but of relations to others: \\"everyone's sickness was sickness to him, offence to anyone was offence to him, everyone's infirmity was infirmity to him.\\"Quoted in John Saward, Perfect Fools: Folly for Christ's Sake in Catholic and Orthodox Spirituality (Oxford University Press, 1980), p. 46 online. The colors of martyrdom Jerome and Gregory, whose views of martyrdom influenced the Cambrai Homily, in a 15th-century depiction The homily outlines three categories of martyrdom, designated by color. This triad is unique, but draws on earlier distinctions between \\"red\\" and \\"white\\" martyrdom. \\"Red\\" martyrdom, or violent death as a result of religious persecution, was rarely obtainable after the establishment of Christian hegemony in the Roman Empire. Blood martyrdom was not a regular feature of early Christian life in Ireland, despite narratives that depict conflict between missionaries and traditional religious authorities such as the druids.On this conflict, most often embodied by confrontations between St. Patrick and the druids, see Philip Freeman, St. Patrick of Ireland: A Biography (Simon and Schuster, 2005), passim, limited preview online; Peter Berresford Ellis, A Brief History of the Druids (Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2002), pp. 76‚Äì77 online; James Bonwick, \\"St. Patrick and the Druids,\\" in Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions (London 1894), pp. 37ff., full text online. On the meaning of these stories as distinguished from any point of historical fact, see D.A. Binchy, \\"A Pre-Christian Survival in Mediaeval Irish Hagiography,\\" in Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe (Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 165‚Äì178. Irish saints had to forgo the bloody \\"crown of martyrdom\\" until the Viking invasions at the end of the 8th century.Bertram Colgrave, Two Lives of Saint Cuthbert (Cambridge University Press, 1940, 1985 ed.), p. 315 online. St. Jerome had used the term \\"white martyrdom\\" for those such as desert hermits who aspired to the condition of martyrdom through strict asceticism.Kristine Edmondson Haney, \\"The 'Christ and the Beasts' Panel on the Ruthwell Cross,\\" in Anglo-Saxon England (Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. 222 online. Jerome explores this new ideal in his Life of St. Paul the Hermit (Vita S. Pauli). See also Desert Fathers. The Cambrai homilist elaborates also on a distinction made by Gregory between inward and outward martyrdom.Bertram Colgrave, Two Lives of Saint Cuthbert, p. 315. White martyrdom (b√°nmartre), he says, is separation from all that one loves, perhaps on a peregrinatio pro Christo or \\"pilgrimage on behalf of Christ\\" that might be extended permanently; blue (or green) martyrdom (glasmartre) involves the denial of desires, as through fasting and penitent labors, without necessarily implying a journey or complete withdrawal from life;Issi in b√°nmartre du duiniu intain scaras ar Dea fri cach r√©et caris, c√© ruc√©sa √°ini n√∫ laubir n-oco. issi ind glasmartre d√≥ intain scaras fria thola le√≥ vel c√©sas s√°ithor i ppennit ocus aithrigi: text from Herren and Brown, Christ in Celtic Christianity, p. 147, note 37 online. red martyrdom (dercmartre) requires torture or death.English translation of the passage in C√©li D√© in Ireland, p. 54 online. The Irish color word glas for the third way of martyrdom can be translated as either \\"blue\\" or \\"green.\\" Its symbolism in regard to martyrdom has been explained variously but not definitively. Glas has a figurative meaning of \\"fresh, raw, sharp\\" (in regard to weather) and \\"harsh\\" (morally); it also applies to complexion (\\"wan\\") or the discoloration of a corpse as \\"bluish, livid.\\" The Irish treatise De arreis prescribes \\"fearsome penances\\" such as spending the night immersed in water or on nettles or nutshells or in the presence of a corpse. In one 12th-century Irish poem, the speaker Suibne Geilt, a dweller in the wilderness, says \\"My feet are wounded; my cheek is glas.\\" In a much-referenced analysis of the Irish colors of martyrdom, Clare Stancliffe presented comparative textual evidence to suggest that glas martyrdom was so called because its austerity produced a sickly pale complexion.Clare Stancliffe, \\"Red, White and Blue Martyrdom,\\" in Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe. Studies in memory of Kathleen Hughes (Cambridge University Press, 1982), passim, especially pp. 29, 35 and 41. The Latin equivalent of glas, Stancliffe argues, is iacinthus or hyacinthus; this is a somewhat unorthodox view. Hyacinthus is a problematic color word, in ancient Greek meaning either \\"blue-black, purplish black\\" or \\"orange, saffron\\"; see M. Eleanor Irwin, \\"Odysseus' 'Hyacinthine Hair' in Odyssey 6.231,\\" Phoenix 44.3 (1990) 205-218 (where it is argued that in context the word means \\"curled\\"). One of the primary means of achieving glas martyrdom is fasting, a common penance which gained special significance from the practice of fasting as codified in early Irish law. A person with an unanswered claim against a social superior might threaten or enact a hunger strike (trocsad) against him, taking up a position outside his residence and potentially polluting his house and family with the responsibility of the faster's death. Irish saints fasted not only to mortify the flesh, but to coerce secular authorities and even to convince God himself. According to the Betha Adamn√°in and some Irish annals, for instance, St. Adomn√°n fasted and immersed himself every night in the River Boyne as a protest against the kingship of √çrgalach mac Conaing. D.A. Binchy has argued that the trocsad, a term that came into use also for hagiography, had a distinctively Irish character,Binchy, \\"A Pre-Christian Survival in Mediaeval Irish Hagiography,\\" in Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe, pp. 168ff, especially 176‚Äì177, with notes 34 and 35 detailing sources on Adomn√°n. leading perhaps to the use of the Celtic color word.According to Pliny (Historia naturalis 22.2), glastum was a Continental Celtic word (glaston) for the plant dye (most often identified as woad) used by the ancient Britons to tint their bodies blue or blue-black for sacred rites. See Xavier Delamarre, ‚ÄúGlaston, glasson,‚Äù in Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise (√âditions Errance, 2003) p. 180, and Gillian Carr, \\"Woad, Tattooing and Identity in Later Iron Age and Early Roman Britain,\\" Oxford Journal of Archaeology 24 (2005) 273‚Äì292, especially pp. 278‚Äì279, though Carr says that glastum is not woad. Caesar (Bellum Gallicum 5.4) calls this coloration vitrum, a usual Latin word for \\"glass.\\" Old Irish glas is etymologically related to the English word glass, Old English gl√¶s, and to Latin glaesum, \\"amber\\", also called electrum (the latter word sometimes meaning \\"electrum\\"). According to the Acta sanctorum, William of Gellone emulated Christ's mortification and \\"then went to the sacred altar purer than electrum and clearer than glass\\"; see Giles Constable, Three Studies in Medieval Religious and Social Thought (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 198 online. The use of the color word glas by the Cambrai homilist to denote a kind of martyrdom may convey a range of sacred connotations, and the complexity of this word grouping may indicate some confusion of color and substance. The Irish triad appears with a Latin fragment at the end of the Cambrai text: castitas in iuventute, continentia in habundantia. This fragment corresponds to a triad in the Prebiarum de multorum exemplaribus, a didactic florilegium of 93 questions. The Prebiarum supplies the missing third element as largitas in paupertate: \\"What are the types of martyrdom other than death? That is, three. Self-control in abundance, generosity in poverty, chastity in youth.\\" Later examples of similar triads also exist.Charles Darwin Wright, The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 33, 60‚Äì61, and 74 online. Alternative interpretations The identification of the text as a fragment of a homily has been criticized by Milton Gatch, who maintains that early Christian Ireland lacked a homiletic movement aimed at sharing the teachings of the Church Fathers in the vernacular. Gatch holds that Irish canonical and penitential literature shows scant interest in preaching, and that homilies represent \\"a peculiarly English effort to assemble useful cycles of preaching materials in the native tongue.\\" The so-called Cambrai Homily, he says, lacks the opening and close that is characteristic of the genre, and was probably just a short tract or excerpt for a florilegium.Milton McCormick Gatch, \\"The Achievement of Aelfric and His Colleagues in European Perspective,\\" in The Old English Homily and Its Backgrounds (SUNY Press, 1978), pp. 51‚Äì52 online. The text The Cambrai Homily appears in a manuscript of the Biblioth√®que Municipale (Cambrai, MS. 679, formerly 619, fos. 37rb‚Äì38rb). The manuscript was copied in the period 763‚Äì790 by a Carolingian scribe working in northern France for Alberic, bishop of Cambrai and Arras. The language of the homily itself, however, dates it to the late 7th century or the beginning of the 8th.Stancliffe, \\"Red, White, and Blue Martyrdom,\\" p. 23. It was inserted into the text of the Collectio Canonum Hibernensis, apparently from a stray leaf that had been slipped into the Latin exemplar. The scribe's knowledge of the Irish language appears to have been limited or nonexistent. An edition was published in 1903 by Whitley Stokes and John Strachan, with some aspects now considered outdated.James Carney, \\"Language and Literature to 1168,\\" in A New History of Ireland, p. 492; Follett, C√©li D√© in Ireland, p. 54, note 144; Stancliffe, \\"Red, White, and Blue Martyrdom,\\" p. 23. * Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus: A Collection of Old-Irish Glosses Scholia Prose and Verse.

It marks the initial break-up boundary between Greenland and Norway, along which seafloor spreading was initiated at the beginning of the Eocene epoch to form the northern Atlantic Ocean. Towards the end of the Eocene, the newly forming Kolbeinsey Ridge propagated northwards from Iceland, splitting the Jan Mayen Microcontinent away from the Greenland Plate. As the Kolbeinsey Ridge formed, so activity on the Aegir Ridge reduced, ceasing completely at the end of the Oligocene epoch when the Kolbeinsey Ridge reached the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone. The relatively thin crust and short lifespan of the Aegir Ridge is anomalous given its proximity to the Iceland hotspot. Mantle hotspots deliver warm, actively-upwelling material to mid-ocean ridges, increasing mantle melting and crustal production. Likely, the stresses associated with plate tectonics and the mechanical structure of the lithosphere created a situation in which spreading at the Kolbeinsey Ridge was energetically favorable to spreading at the Aegir Ridge. As the Kolbeinsey Ridge began rifting, hotspot material would then draw out of the Aegir Ridge and flow preferentially towards the Kolbeinsey Ridge, leading to the ultimate extinction of the spreading center.

It took place at the Taku Forts (also called Peiho Forts) near Tanggu District (Wade-Giles: Pei Tang- Ho), approximately 60 kilometers (36 mi.) southeast of the city of Tianjin (Tientsin). Background James Hope Grant The aim of the allied French- British expedition was to compel the Chinese government at Peking to observe the trade treaties signed between their governments at Tianjin (Tientsin) in 1858, which included allowing the British to continue the opium trade in China. Lt-Gen. Sir Hope Grant was the British commander with Lt-Gen. Charles Cousin-Montauban, Comte de Palikao in charge of the French. The allied force consisted of 11,000 British including ~1,000 cavalry, as well as 6,700 French troops. The Taku Forts were defended by 7,000 Qing troops including some 2,000 cavalry. At least forty-five artillery pieces were among the Chinese defenders. A year earlier, a similar attempt had been made to steam up the river but the Qing forces had made a barrier across the river resulting in the Battle of Taku Forts (1859) that was a disaster for the Anglo French force. Following that humiliation, Captain Fisher of the Corps of Royal Engineers and three British ships, \\"Cruiser\\", \\"Forester\\" and \\"Starling\\" were left behind to survey the area, on land as well as along the coast. The reports would determine the strategy for the next attempt. The conclusion of the Indian Mutiny had also released troops to reinforce the Hong Kong station. Battle An illustration of Rogers reaching the top of the wall with help from Lieutenant Lenon Not wanting to have a repeat of the 1859 disaster, on 30 July 1860 the Anglo-French army began landing at Beitang to the north of the Forts. A few days later a reconnaissance force moved towards the Taku Forts for close observation, two British soldiers were wounded by bullets from a Chinese jingal. The whole force was ashore by 7 August and a few days later on 12 August, the allied force advanced. Pushing back enemy forces in front of them, including ~2,000 cavalry, the Anglo French expedition arrived at the Forts. There were four, two on the north and two on the south side. The French wanted to attack the southern forts, but the survey by Fisher indicated that the key was the main northern fort. On 17 August his plan was adopted. Five batteries were established during the night of 20‚Äì21 August with fascines made using the straw walls and roofs of nearby barracks. # Battery - 6 x French field-pieces and 1 x 8-inch gun # Battery - 3 x 8-inch mortars this battery platform was made from coffin lids which were thick. # Battery - 2 x 32-pounders and 2 x 8-inch howitzers # Battery - 2 x 8-inch guns # Battery - 6 x Armstrong guns Opening fire next morning, it took four hours to crush the fort's artillery. Then the major assault took place on the main Chinese fort, attacking as two columns, one British and one French. Heavy fighting ensued as the attackers crossed several Chinese ditches and spiked bamboo palisades. After the Capture of the Taku Forts The Anglo-French force initially attacked the main gate of the fortifications, but it was found there were two wet ditches and many spikes. An engineer managed to cut the ropes holding up the drawbridge, but it was too heavily damaged by artillery to be effectively used as a route. The main attack was therefore made against the walls using the ladders. The French column managed to get onto the parapet first. The first British officer to enter the fort was Lieutenant Robert Montresor Rogers, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery that day. He was closely followed by a private, John McDougall who was also awarded the Victoria Cross. Resistance continued inside the fort for three and a half hours before the fort was cleared of defenders. During the fighting, fourteen British soldiers were killed and Lieutenant Rogers was severely wounded. Forty-six other men were also wounded. The French forces suffered 158 casualties. Over 100 Qing defenders were killed, many more wounded and forty-five guns captured. A flag of truce arrived by boat from a southern fort, the envoy was not permitted to negotiate so the Anglo British force advanced, two fresh regiments, The Buffs and the 8th Punjab Infantry, being brought up to attack the second northern fort in heavy rain. Little resistance was offered and it was quickly captured. The two southern forts were untenable and capitulated. Southern Chinese coolies served with the French and British forces against the Qing: \\"The Chinese coolies entertained in 1857 from the inhabitants of South China, renegades though they were, served the British faithfully and cheerfully before Canton, and throughout the operations in North China in 1860 they likewise proved invaluable. Their coolness under fire was admirable. At the assault of the Peiho Forts in 1860 they carried the French ladders to the ditch, and, standing in the water up to their necks, supported them with their hands to enable the storming party to cross. It was not usual to take them into action ; they, however, bore the dangers of a distant fire with the greatest composure, evincing a strong desire to close with their compatriots, and engage them in mortal combat with ther bamboos.‚Äî(Fisher.)\\" Aftermath Seven awards of the Victoria Cross were made for Gallantry on 21 August to soldiers of the 44th Regiment of Foot and the 67th Regiment of Foot (see List of Victoria Cross recipients by campaign). The battle was one of the last major engagements of the Second Opium War. The river route to Peking was now open, the Chinese authorities capitulated all 22 forts along the river as far as Tianjin, including that town. The army would march to the Battle of Palikao. The fighting ended with the allied occupation of Peking on 13 October 1860 and the Chinese acceptance of the trading treaties. References ;Footnotes ;Bibliography *Bartlett, Beatrice S.

Origins DMI was founded by Perry Roark, James Sweeney and Brian Jordan in the late 1990s in the Maryland Department of Corrections. Roark was a close associate of the Black Guerrilla Family and received permission from them to start an organization to unite white inmates in the system. The group grew in size quickly due to infiltration by a man named Michael Quinn, who had joined to secure protection for himself. He recruited anybody who wanted to join in every location. Sweeney sought numbers as opposed to quality as he felt secure with numbers and thought numbers brought strength. Identifiers *Members often refer to each other as \\"Dawgs\\", an acronym meaning \\"DMI Against World Government\\" *Tattoos include the grim reaper, pit bulls, DMI, the numbers 4, 13, and 9 (4=D, 13=M, 9=I), and the pyramid with a severed eye of providence. *The mark of the dead man, an upside down cross for either stabbing or killing multiple people in the Maryland correctional system. *Skull tattoos with the eyes inked in red also identify a killer. These tattoos are worn strictly by O.G. members typically in high ranking status. Any member with red eyed skulls in a visible area, typically on the forearms or hands, denotes they killed a very high ranking member of a rival gang or a staff member of the prison system. *Although members usually don't wear particular colors, some have recently started to wear black and white bandanas in their left pocket Structure The gang hierarchy is divided into many sections, with the Supreme Commanders (SC) at the very top. These are the gang's founders Perry Roark, James Sweeney and Bryan Jordan. DMI members in each facility are collectively called a \\"unit\\". Each unit is led by a commander, followed by lieutenant, field general, sergeant-at-arms, and a finance officer. Around 2007, a new position known as the \\"elders\\" has been established between the Supreme Commanders and the units, in order to help direct orders down the hierarchy. Multiple subdivisions of the DMI are present throughout Maryland. Within these subdivisions, the members are usually associated with other widely known gangs, such as MS-13 or Black Guerrilla Family. The \\"Kings Krew\\" allows for \\"Young Thugs\\", new members seeking to join a larger part of a gang, to prove themselves worthy of becoming an \\"OG\\" (original gangster.) The Kings Krew consists of smaller divisions to take into account the different districts in each county. Examples are: * \\"Los Reys de Dinero\\" * \\"The Won Kings\\" * \\"Lil' Kings\\" * \\"Kings of PG\\" * \\"3rd District Kings\\" Criminal activities Initially, DMI worked for the BGF, but soon began offering those services to other gangs by targeting rivals and correctional staff. This led to entry into drug trafficking and other crimes to advance their own agendas as their size and power increased. The once tight-knit structure of the group has broken down with the explosion in numbers, as members compete with one another leading to violence between members. Fueling these internal divisions is the fact that leaders disagreed about the direction of the gang. Perry Roark wanted to return the gang to its former position alongside the BGF, while other leaders like James Sweeney, want to adopt a white supremacist ideology. A federal grand jury in Baltimore has charged 22 defendants with conspiracy to participate in a violent racketeering enterprise. All but one defendant are also charged with conspiring to distribute drugs. The indictment was returned on October 6, 2011 and unsealed upon the arrests of seven defendants and the execution of seven search warrants. Eleven defendants were previously in custody and four defendants are still at large. The highly secret organization has begun to recruit members on the streets of Baltimore city, Baltimore County, and AA county.

Marlinspike is the creator of Signal, co-founder of the Signal Foundation, and currently serves as the CEO of Signal Messenger. He is also a co-author of the Signal Protocol encryption used by Signal, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype, responsible for the largest deployment of consumer end-to-end encryption. Marlinspike is a former head of the security team at Twitter and the author of a proposed SSL authentication system replacement called Convergence. He previously maintained a cloud-based WPA cracking service and a targeted anonymity service called GoogleSharing. Biography Originally from the state of Georgia, Marlinspike moved to San Francisco in the late 1990s. He then worked for several technology companies, including enterprise infrastructure software maker BEA Systems Inc. In 2004, Marlinspike bought a derelict sailboat and, along with three friends, refurbished it and sailed around the Bahamas while making a documentary about their journey called Hold Fast. In 2010, Marlinspike was the chief technology officer and co-founder of Whisper Systems, an enterprise mobile security startup company. In May 2010, Whisper Systems launched TextSecure and RedPhone. These were applications that provided end-to-end encrypted SMS messaging and voice calling, respectively. The company was acquired by the social-media firm Twitter for an undisclosed amount in late 2011. The acquisition was done \\"primarily so that Mr. Marlinspike could help the then-startup improve its security\\". During his time as head of cybersecurity at Twitter, the firm made Whisper Systems' apps open source. Marlinspike left Twitter in early 2013 and founded Open Whisper Systems as a collaborative open source project for the continued development of TextSecure and RedPhone. At the time, Marlinspike and Trevor Perrin started developing the Signal Protocol, an early version of which was first introduced in the TextSecure app in February 2014. In November 2015, Open Whisper Systems unified the TextSecure and RedPhone applications as Signal. Between 2014 and 2016, Marlinspike worked with WhatsApp, Facebook, and Google to integrate the Signal Protocol into their messaging services. On February 21, 2018, Marlinspike and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Foundation. Research =SSL stripping= In a 2009 paper, Marlinspike introduced the concept of SSL stripping, a man-in-the-middle attack in which a network attacker could prevent a web browser from upgrading to an SSL connection in a subtle way that would likely go unnoticed by a user. He also announced the release of a tool, \`sslstrip\`, which would automatically perform these types of man-in-the-middle attacks. The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) specification was subsequently developed to combat these attacks. =SSL implementation attacks= Marlinspike has discovered a number of different vulnerabilities in popular SSL implementations. Notably, Marlinspike published a 2002 paper on exploiting SSL/TLS implementations that did not correctly verify the X.509 v3 \\"BasicConstraints\\" extension in public key certificate chains. This allowed anyone with a valid CA-signed certificate for any domain name to create what appeared to be valid CA-signed certificates for any other domain. The vulnerable SSL/TLS implementations included the Microsoft CryptoAPI, making Internet Explorer and all other Windows software that relied on SSL/TLS connections vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. In 2011, the same vulnerability was discovered to have remained present in the SSL/TLS implementation on Apple Inc.'s iOS.Apple iOS Bug Worse Than Advertised/ Also notably, Marlinspike presented a 2009 paper, where he introduced the concept of a null-prefix attack on SSL certificates. He revealed that all major SSL implementations failed to properly verify the Common Name value of a certificate, such that they could be tricked into accepting forged certificates by embedding null characters into the CN field. =Solutions to the CA problem= In 2011, Marlinspike presented a talk titled SSL And The Future Of Authenticity at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. He outlined many of the current problems with certificate authorities, and announced the release of a software project called Convergence to replace Certificate Authorities. In 2012, Marlinspike and Trevor Perrin submitted an Internet Draft for TACK, which is designed to provide SSL certificate pinning and help solve the CA problem, to the Internet Engineering Task Force. =Cracking MS-CHAPv2= In 2012, Marlinspike and David Hulton presented research that makes it possible to reduce the security of MS-CHAPv2 handshakes to a single DES encryption. Hulton built hardware capable of cracking the remaining DES encryption in less than 24 hours, and the two made the hardware available for anyone to use as an Internet service.  Traveling  Marlinspike says that when flying within the United States he is unable to print his own boarding pass, is required to have airline ticketing agents make a phone call in order to issue one, and is subjected to secondary screening at TSA security checkpoints. While entering the United States via a flight from the Dominican Republic in 2010, Marlinspike was detained by federal agents for nearly five hours, all his electronic devices were confiscated, and at first agents claimed he would only get them back if he provided his passwords so they could decrypt the data. Marlinspike refused to do this, and the devices were eventually returned, though he noted that he could no longer trust them, saying, \\"They could have modified the hardware or installed new keyboard firmware.\\" Speaking engagements * DEF CON 17: \\"More Tricks for Defeating SSL\\" * DEF CON 18 and Black Hat 2010: \\"Changing Threats to Privacy\\" * DEF CON 19 and Black Hat 2011: \\"SSL and the Future of Authenticity\\" * DEF CON 20: \\"Defeating PPTP VPNs and WPA2 with MS-CHAPv2\\" * Webstock '15: \\"Making private communication simple\\" * 36C3: \\"The ecosystem is moving\\" Recognition * In 2013 and 2014, the Shuttleworth Foundation provided Marlinspike with a total of $289,487.18 in funding for Open Whisper Systems. * In 2016, Fortune magazine named Marlinspike among its 40 under 40 for being the founder of Open Whisper Systems and \\"[encrypting] the communications of more than a billion people worldwide\\".

Life and work Stojan studied physics and mathematics at the Richelieu Lyceum (today's Odessa University) in Odessa and in Sankt Petersburg and from 1906 to 1907 in Paris. From 1919 to 1922, he was a high school teacher in Serbia. From 1925, he worked at the Universal Esperanto Association in Geneva at its biggest work, the Bibliography of the International Language (Bibliografio de Internacia Lingvo) which was published in 1929. He spent the end of his life in Southern France where he died of drowning. Esperantist engagement He joined the Esperanto movement in 1903. According to the Encyclopedia of Esperanto of 1933, \\"he was one of the most competent regarding the dictionary technique.\\" Over sixteen years, he worked on twelve dictionaries; among them are the great Russian dictionary of the Imperial Academy. His other well-known dictionaries are the Ornithological Eight-language Dictionary (1911) and the Small Russian- Esperanto dictionary and the Illustrated Dictionary of the Russian Language (760 pages and 2000 pictures). In 1929, his Bibliography of the International Language (Bibliografio de Internacia Lingvo) was published. In 1913, he proposed the creation of the Universal Card Encyclopedia (Universala Slipa Enciklopedio, USE) which, according to his idea, could be updated by adding cards for each subject. He also wrote a great number of scientific articles and original literature in Esperanto. Vindiania and Biosophy In France he worked on La Vindiania, a thesis on the origin of the Indo-European languages and on a complete philosophy of life, which he named biosophy (in Esperanto - Biozofio). However, his works remained in the manuscript form and circulated among his friends, and only one book was actually published in 1946 in Arras.

The Night Strangler proved almost as popular as its predecessor garnering strong ratings and eventually prompting ABC to order a TV series (neither writer Richard Matheson nor producer/director Dan Curtis was involved in the TV series). In the United States, the TV movie ran (without commercials) approximately 74 minutes. ABC planned to release the film overseas as a theatrical release and had additional footage shot rounding out the movie to 90 minutes.The Night Stalker Companion,\\" by Mark Dawidziak Plot In 1973, reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin), now in Seattle, Washington (having been run out of Las Vegas at the end of the last film), is hired by his former editor, Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland) to cover a series of killings in which the victims, all exotic dancers, are strangled, have their necks crushed and are then drained of a few ounces of blood. A coroner's report also reveals that the victims all had traces of rotting flesh on their necks. Researcher Titus Berry (Wally Cox) discovers that there was a similar rash of killings in 1952, setting Kolchak on the trail of another unbelievable story. Kolchak is stonewalled by the police, who want to have certain details of the murders kept secret. Out of \\"burning curiosity,\\" Berry researches further back, and learns of another series of murders in 1931. Berry and Kolchak discover that similar murders have been occurring every 21 years since 1889, with each series of murders taking place over a period of 18 days. Kolchak determines that the killer needs the blood for a kind of elixir of life which keeps him alive for 21 years at a time. Of course, no one believes Kolchak, and the powers that be want to silence him. Berry uncovers further clues in an old interview with Mark Twain leading to a Dr. Richard Malcolm, a surgeon in the Union Army during the Civil War, who was one of the original staff at Seattle's Westside Mercy Hospital. Though the hospital is long gone, Kolchak goes to the clinic standing on the site, in the hope that it might still have the hospital's old records, but he finds something far more important just inside the front door: a painting of the clinic's founder, a Dr. Malcolm Richards, who is the spitting image of Richard Malcolm. Kolchak calls Berry to meet him there and proceeds to alter the painting to make the similarity more obvious. Berry is amazed, but the police are less than impressed, and Kolchak is arrested. Finally, Kolchak and Berry convince the police (and their boss) of the facts: that the killer really is practically immortal, and that he will kill again. But the story is once again suppressed. Kolchak, working with helpful exotic dancer Louise (Jo Ann Pflug), enters into a race against time to stop the killer before he is able to complete the creation of his elixir and disappear for another 21 years. In the Seattle Underground under the old clinic, Kolchak has a face-to-face confrontation with Dr. Malcolm/Richards (Richard Anderson); the night strangler admits having first tried the elixir in 1868 and that he had hoped to spread the knowledge of immortality until he started aging in 1889 and his family also died (their mummified remains are kept near the doctor's laboratory). He intends to continue each 21-year cycle until he can make the process permanent. Before the night strangler can drink his sixth dose of elixir, Kolchak smashes the beaker. The night strangler tries to kill Kolchak but fails due to rapid aging; as the police burst into the room the aging killer commits suicide by throwing himself outside a high window. The film concludes with a once-again unemployed Kolchak bickering with Vincenzo and Louise as Carl drives the three of them to New York City. Novelization of TV Film In the novelization of The Night Strangler, it is strongly hinted that the immortal villain, Dr. Richard Malcolm, is actually the Count of St. Germain. When asked directly, Malcolm laughs ironically but does not deny it.  Third TV film sequel  A third film was planned, based on a story by Richard Matheson, but completed by science fiction and horror novelist William F. Nolan; the two share credit on the unproduced script. The third film was set aside when ABC elected to order the television series and have it produced by Universal. None of the original participants, aside from actors Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland, appeared in the television series. Titled The Night Killers and set in Honolulu, Hawaii, the script had Tony Vincenzo hiring Kolchak to work for him. Once again, Kolchak discovers a cover-up ‚Äî this time involving a mysterious UFO, a nuclear power plant and important people being murdered and replaced by androids. Kolchak ties all of this together, believing that the aliens on the UFO landed on Earth intending to set up a colony and replacing key government figures with these androids to assist them in their secret colony.Darrenmcgavin.netThis theme of androids taking over the Earth was used in the Japanese cartoon \\"Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks (1993)\\".

Another in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is not shown on this map. Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) is a Doppler weather radar system with a three-dimensional \\"pencil beam\\" used primarily for the detection of hazardous wind shear conditions, precipitation, and winds aloft on and near major airports situated in climates with great exposure to thunderstorms in the United States. As of 2011, all were in-service with 45 operational radars, some covering multiple airports in major metropolitan locations, across the United States & Puerto Rico. Several similar weather radars have also been sold to other countries such as China (Hong Kong). Funded by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), TDWR technology was developed in the early 1990s at Lincoln Laboratory, part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to assist air traffic controllers by providing real-time wind shear detection and high-resolution precipitation data. The primary advantage of TDWRs over previous weather radars is that it has a finer range resolution meaning it can see smaller areas of the atmosphere. The reason for the resolution is that the TDWR has a narrower beam than traditional radar systems, and that it uses a set of algorithms to reduce ground clutter.  Characteristics  TDWR uses a carrier wave in the frequency band of 5600‚Äì5650 MHz (5 cm wavelength), with a narrow beam and angular resolution of 0.5 degree, and has a peak power of 250 kW. In reflectivity, the resolution in distance is within of the radar and from to to the radar. The reason for this difference is that the width resolution being angular, at larger range the width of the beam becomes quite large and to obtain a better averaging of data in a resolution volume, one has to increase the number of range pulse bins. This cut off is arbitrarily set for the software at . In radial velocities, data are available up to from the radar with the full angular resolution of 0.5 degrees and range resolution of . Because of the Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) used, there is aliasing and the maximum non-ambiguous velocity is . TDWR can perform near-surface scans at a 0.1-0.3 degree angle of inclination from the Earth's surface every minute. It can also perform composite scans in which the radar observes at several different angles of inclination in order to obtain a fuller picture of the atmospheric conditions; each such composite scan requires 6 minutes.  Comparison with NEXRAD  A TDWR return (top) and NEXRAD return (bottom) showing the improved resolution in reflectivity, but also showing the attenuation in the TDWR due to absorption from heavy precipitation as a black gap = Advantages = A NEXRAD weather radar currently used by the National Weather Service (NWS) is a 10 cm wavelength (2700-3000 MHz) radar capable of a complete scan every 4.5 to 10 minutes, depending on the number of angles scanned, and depending on whether or not MESO- SAILShttps://www.roc.noaa.gov/wsr88d/PublicDocs/NewTechnology/MESO- SAILS_Description_Briefing_Jan_2014.pdf is active, which adds a supplemental low-level scan while completing a volume scan. Its resolution is 0.5 degrees in width and in range. The non-ambiguous radial velocity is up to from the radar. The range resolution of the TDWR is nearly twice that of that classic NEXRAD scheme. This will give much better details on small features in precipitation patterns, particularly in thunderstorms, in reflectivity and radial velocity. However, this finer resolution is only available up to from the radar; beyond that, the resolution is close to that of the NEXRAD. However, since August 2008, oversampling on NEXRAD has increased its resolution in lower elevations in reflectivity data to by 0.5 degree, and increased the range of Doppler velocity data to . This lessens the advantages of TDWR for those elevations. = Shortcomings = The TDWRs and NEXRADs complement each other with overlapping coverage, each designed to optimally view different airspace regimes. TDWR's rapid update rate over short range (55 nmi range) captures microscale weather events quickly in terminal airspace. NEXRAD is a long range radar (200 nmi range) designed to serve multiple en route functions at high altitude, above terminal airspace, and far between terminals. NEXRAD's slower update rate covering a wider volume, captures mesoscale weather events. The shorter wavelength, which is closer to the size of a raindrop than the wavelength, is partially absorbed by precipitation. This is a serious drawback to using TDWR, as the signal can be strongly attenuated in heavy precipitation. This attenuation means that the radar cannot \\"see\\" very far through heavy rain and could miss severe weather such as strong thunderstorms which may contain the signature of a tornado, when there is heavy rain falling between the radar and that storm. When heavy rain is falling on the radome, the range of the TDWR is further limited. Finally, hail in a thunderstorm scanned by a TDWR can entirely block the signal as its size is larger than the wavelength. A second problem is the smaller non-ambiguous radial velocity or Nyquist velocity. In the case of the TDWR, this means the velocity of precipitations moving at a speed beyond away or toward the radar will be analyzed incorrectly because of aliasing. Algorithms to correct for this do not always yield the proper results. NEXRAD has a threshold that is twice as high () and thus less processing and interpretation are needed. Because of this, the resolution of radar reflectivity for small scale features such as mesocyclones might be better in TDWR, but the velocity resolution may be worse, or at the very least incorrectly analyzed. Thus, it is best to use the TDWR in conjunction with a traditional NEXRAD nearby to ensure that nothing is missed. In contrast to NEXRAD, which has national coverage of the contiguous United States (although with some holes due to terrain), TDWR has sporadic coverage meant for major airports. While certain areas of the country (the Northeast megalopolis, the states of Ohio and Florida, and the southwestern quarter of Tornado Alley in Oklahoma and Texas) have a high density of TDWR units, others (the entire West Coast, the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, portions of the Deep South, and a stretch running from northern Pennsylvania through upstate New York and into northern New England) have no TDWR coverage at all.  Data processing improvements  The National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) has a program of development and improvement of radar products extracted from data obtained from TDWR and NEXRAD radars. The Severe Weather Warning Applications and Technology Transfer (SWAT) group is sponsored by the National Weather Service and the FAA.

The party used the oil on the surface to lubricate wagon wheel hubs, as polish, and as a poultice. After the party reached Great Salt Lake, a group returned and dug a well at the seep for other pioneers. The well served until 1869 when the Union Pacific Railroad brought petroleum to Salt Lake City. It is believed that the trappers who built Fort Bridger were aware of the well; however, its first published description appeared in an 1848 guidebook written by a W. Clayton, who accompanied the initial Mormon expedition that had settled the Salt Lake Valley in the previous year. Oil is comparatively plentiful in the immediate vicinity of the Young Oil Well. Among the nearest is the White Oil Well, located on the Hilliard Flat elsewhere in the same township, which Judge C.M. White began working in 1867. Although he reached a depth of , he abandoned it in 1868; an oil company from Evanston later attempted to obtain more petroleum from the same site, but their efforts were soon abandoned. The issuance of oil at the Young Well is believed to be the result of an underlying fault. Although secondary to the larger Absaroka Fault, it is substantial enough to permit the ascension of petroleum from oil shale. Both Hilliard Flat wells yield heavy crude oil; a 1905 survey suggested that it is derived from the same source as the a region's lighter Benton oil and proposed that the lighter content of the Hilliard Flat oil evaporates before it reaches the surface. This survey observed that oil seepage was then limited to just a few gallons per day. In 1985, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its importance to the pioneers of 1847.

The PR interval is sometimes termed the PQ interval. Interpretation Variations in the PQ interval can be associated with certain medical conditions: * Duration  A long PR interval (of over 200 ms) indicates a slowing of conduction between the atria and ventricles, usually due to slow conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV node). This is known as first degree heart block. Prolongation can be associated with fibrosis of the AV node, high vagal tone, medications that slow the AV node such as beta-blockers, hypokalemia, acute rheumatic fever, or carditis associated with Lyme disease.  A short PR interval (of less than 120ms) may be associated with a Pre-excitation syndromes such as Wolff‚ÄìParkinson‚ÄìWhite syndrome or Lown‚ÄìGanong‚ÄìLevine syndrome, and also junctional arrhythmia like atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia or junctional rhythm.

After the Independence in 1956, Yahia became the president of l'Ecole de Tunis, which was created in 1947 by Pierre Boucherle in an attempt to gather Tunisian artists, regardless of their religious, racial, or artistic background, and with the common interest of establishing a Tunisian painting style. Peintres de Tunisie de 1900 √† 1960 (Harissa.com) Biography Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Djerbian father, Turki studied first at Sadiki College and later at the Lyc√©e Carnot de Tunis. At the same time, he attended a Koranic school, where his interest was piqued, for the first time, by the arrangement of form and colour on writing tablets. He pursued his secondary school studies at the Lyc√©e Alaoui, where he had as a drawing teacher Georges Le Mare, who discovered the talents of the young novice and where he applied himself to learning the basics of the discipline. Faced with family pressures, Turki abandoned his studies and joined the civil service.A√Øcha Filali, Yahia, p√®re de la peinture en Tunisie, coll. Peinture, √©d. C√©r√®s Productions, Tunis, 2002 He also received academic training at the Centre for art studies, which in 1930 became the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts. Turki experienced his first success in 1923 in the Tunisian salon. Turki‚Äôs first painting was made in oil on canvas. He later obtained a scholarship and went to Paris in 1927, where he kept company with Albert Marquet and Lucien Mainssieux. He studied at the Centre d‚Äôart de Tunis with a scholarship from the French Protectorate which he achieved with the help of Alexandre Fichet and Pierre Boyer.Yahia Turki (1901‚Äì1969) Retrieved on 19 Feb 2018 In 1928, he stayed in France and took part in the Colonial Exhibition of French artists and the Salon des Ind√©pendents. During his stay in Paris from 1926 to 1928 and from 1931 to 1935 he used to visit the studios of French artists the likes of Matisse and Derain. On his return to Tunis in 1935, he exhibited a series of works with Parisian themes. He was a member of the Groupe des Dix in 1947 and one of the founders of the √âcole de Tunis (Tunisian School) in 1948. In 1956, after Tunisian independence, he succeeded Pierre Boucherle as the president of the Tunisian School, a post he occupied until his death. He also became the vice-president of the Tunisian salon. He made a great influence at younger artists who was eager to \\"reconcile Tunisian national identity within an inherited system of artistic practices\\". This concept of him easily can be traced in his works. Turki's architectural spaces, landscapes, still lives, and portraits depicted everyday life of Tunisia. In the 1950s he made a murals in the √âcole d‚ÄôAgriculture de Moghrane(Agricaultural School in Mograne). Among his student were the likes of Abdelaziz ben Rais (1903-1962), Hatem El Mekki (1918-2003) and Ammar Farhat (1911-1986). Some of his works have been sold at auction, including Femme en sefsari which was sold at Artcurial Orientalism in 2013 for $9,576.Yahia Turki Retrieved on 19 Feb 2018 At age 52, Turki married a Tunisian, and had a daughter named Nazly.

As he studied the body, a woman who resembled Liza entered the room. Thinking she must be Liza's sister, Dr. Greitzer makes nothing of it. Eventually the two strike up a conversation. The woman tells Max that she'd seen his obituary in the newspapers. It is then revealed that both Liza and Max are dead. They then banter between Max and Liza about the nature of death, the thought of their afterlife and of immortality. Analysis Upon death, Max and Liza show no concern for the fact that they're dead. Nothing seems to have any sort of relevance. What they speak of upon learning they're dead is of what they'll find. They ponder whether or not there is a Hell or Paradise. Liza at one point states \\"I imagined that the end would be much more dramatic.\\" The fact that the two characters meet in death seems to mean that they were destined to be together. This \\"transition between two modes of existence\\" as Dr. Greitzer calls it, is one mostly of reflection; the characters use it to remember the past and also question the future. At the end of the story, as they hover aimlessly about, looking down at all that surrounds them, Max Greitzer utters the most profound and meaningful quote in the story when he says \\"Of all my disenchantments, immortality is the greatest.\\" This makes one question the religious beliefs of the two characters. In death, they still seem to question and interpret what's happened to them as it comes rather than with any sort of conviction.

It was created during the early Middle Ages, long before the Ludwig Canal and the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal. If it was indeed operational, this canal would have been the first to link the Rhine basin to the Danube basin, across the European Watershed. However, contemporary sources are contradictory as to whether it was ever finished or not. Geography Near Treuchtlingen and Wei√üenburg in Bayern the European Watershed between the rivers of the Rhine basin and those of the Danube basin is very narrow. Only around 2 km of fairly level terrain lie between the Swabian Rezat and the Altm√ºhl. History Carolingian sources report that Frankish king Charlemagne gave orders to dig a 2 kilometers long canal from Treuchtlingen to Wei√üenburg in Bayern in 793. According to Einhard, writing around two decades later, Charlemagne was convinced by \\"supposed experts\\" that it would be possible to travel in comfort by ship from Rhine to Danube if the Rezat could be linked to the Altm√ºhl. The king assembled a large number of workers and in person supervised construction in the fall of 793 of a 2,000 step long and 300 feet wide moat. Einhard reports that the project failed due to the marshy ground and continuous rainfall, which caused excavated material to slide back. But other sources indicate that it was in fact completed and fully operational. The canal may have worked with several ponds, dikes and dams. It seems that the goal of this work was to improve the transportation of goods between the Rhineland and Bavaria. Another theory claims that the main purpose was to bring back Charlemagne's war vessels from the Danube to the Rhine. In the 19th century, the project inspired king Ludwig I of Bavaria to build the Ludwig Canal, which opened in 1846. Research Research by Robert Koch in 1992/3 showed that the floor of the canal was not level, but followed a step-like profile, rising from the direction of the Altm√ºhl towards the north. Koch argued that the canal could have been flooded by damming the Rezat at Dettenheim and that the project could quite possibly have been finished. Geoarcheological work in 2009, however, showed that what had been considered an early medieval dam at Dettenheim was likely only built in the late Middle Ages and did not in fact serve to dam the Rezat. A DFG research project at the site, started in 2012, is still ongoing. It is part of a project \\"Ports from Imperial Roman times to the early Middle Ages\\" and looks at what the original canal may have looked like - and if there are any indications of whether it ever actually linked the two rivers. Today Today, only a 500 meter long part of the canal still exists as a water-filled moat. It lies in the municipality of Treuchtlingen in the Ortsteil known as Graben. The heaps of dug out earth that make up the banks stretch further, totalling around 1,200 m, rising to up to 10 meters in height. To the north a dry section of around 700 meters follows which is still visible in the terrain but has been almost completely leveled.

Founding Edward Lloyd launched Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly Newspaper in 1842. It was the first of three popular papers to be created for those who only had the leisure to read on Sundays. It was followed by the News of the World in 1843 and Reynold's News in 1850. On 16 February 1896, Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly became the only British newspaper in the nineteenth century to sell more than a million copies. Curiously enough, that day would have been Lloyd's 81st birthday had he lived beyond the age of 75. Lloyd was already a prolific publisher of periodicals and serialised fiction. He had created titles that sounded like newspapers, such as the Lloyd‚Äôs Penny Sunday Times and People‚Äôs Police Gazette, but these were a sham to avoid paying stamp duty. The sham lay in printing fictitious or historical stories echoing current events so that readers could glean the outcome of the real event from the d√©nouement of the story. Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly got off to a complicated start. It first appeared in 1842 as Lloyd's Penny Illustrated Newspaper, selling at one penny. Lloyd tried to keep his version free of stamp duty by printing the illustrations of current events without captions. Most of the text was devoted to literary and dramatic material but, in its seventh issue, the Stamp Office spotted ‚Äúnews‚Äù in the theatre listings. A more colourful version said that it was news of a lion's escape from a travelling menagerie, but this has never been found. Lloyd may have felt that it made a better story than announcement of a play due to open in Deptford. Lloyd was determined to publish a newspaper so he decided to pay the duty and the paper was relaunched as Lloyd's Illustrated London Newspaper priced at twopence, with a masthead showing St Pauls and the Thames in the manner of the recently launched Illustrated London News which had been a terrific success from the start, despite costing sixpence. Breaking even financially was the real challenge: revenues net of stamp duty failed to cover the cost of the illustrations (stamp duty was more than the 1d duty on news because of the heavy duty on paper - 1¬Ωd per pound in weight). After another seven issues, Lloyd dropped all pictures and changed the name to Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly London Newspaper. In the autumn of 1843, he raised the price to threepence, compensating for this by increasing the number of words per page. He used the postal service for distribution as postage was included in the 1d stamp duty ‚Äî a useful concession that also enabled him to beat off the newsagents‚Äô demand for a 1d commission. Even then, it was often a struggle to keep it going during the turbulence of the late 1840s. ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù was dropped from the title in 1848, probably reflecting the growing availability of rail transport. Early years Lloyd kept the paper in his own tight control. Most of it consisted of objective news reporting without comment or speculation. Ample coverage was given to foreign news, particularly from continental Europe. It also made room for theatre, books, poetry, sport and essay features. The content had to be morally sound so that women would want to read it too. Indigent men had been poorly served by the newspaper trade but indigent women had been entirely overlooked. In his previous publishing business, Lloyd had seen the vast unmet demand for something good to read among the growing numbers of people who had learnt their letters but found nothing that they could afford except trash or sermonizing. Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly, and indeed the News of the World at that time, were a long way from being the purveyors of scandal, crime and sensation for which they have since been falsely condemned. In addition to the serious-minded content, Lloyd's Weekly set a standard of vocabulary and syntax that modern readers would find deeply unappetising and dull, as well as difficult. Lloyd's role in spreading literacy among the poor was considerable. The only regular political content in Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly appeared in a leading article on the front page. For the first ten years, the paper was outspokenly radical. This may well have reflected Lloyd's own political views, of which little is known. Unlike his rival, George W M Reynolds, he never became a Chartist. It is also clear that he would have chosen a radical slant because the paper was intended for those who had no vote ‚Äì the urban poor who owned no property. To them, Whigs and Tories were equally irrelevant, if not actively hostile. This leader was the only contribution to the paper made by the ‚Äúeditor‚Äù. Lloyd kept the content and broader direction of the paper in his own hands. He had two editors in the early years ‚Äì Robert Bell and William Carpenter ‚Äì both well-known radicals. However, neither stayed long. Lloyd would then have commissioned the leaders in the same way that he commissioned other features. It is not known whether he ever wrote them himself, but that is unlikely. In 1852, he appointed Douglas Jerrold as editor. Jerrold was a journalist, writer and playwright with a powerful presence in the mid-century literary world. Lloyd was so anxious to enlist his help in raising the paper's profile that he paid him the extravagantly generous salary of ¬£1,000 a year. Jerrold wrote gentler and much more elegant leaders than his predecessors had, but any supposed allegiance to the Liberal Party was only evident in his lack of support for the Conservatives. \\"His radicalism was that of the humourist,\\" his son Blanchard wrote in the biography of his father. \\"From his stern independence no minister could wrest a promise.\\" Lloyd and Jerrold had a warm relationship on the paper and outside it. Sadly, it was cut short by Jerrold's death in 1857. As a gesture to his dying friend, Lloyd appointed his son Blanchard as editor. Blanchard Jerrold remained in position until he died in 1885 but, as an absentee leader writer, he never played his father's important role in the development of the paper. Later years Within weeks of launch, circulation leapt to an encouraging 32,000-odd, but it had done little more than double by 1850. By 1857, however, its fortunes had turned for several reasons. Its coverage of the Great Exhibition of 1851 brought it to the notice of a wider public. Douglas Jerrold's appointment in 1852 boosted regular sales as did his exhaustive coverage of the Duke of Wellington‚Äôs death and funeral that year, with the funeral alone generating 150,000 sales. On abolition of the stamp duty on news in 1855, Lloyd lowered the price to twopence and his early ambition to sell 100,000 copies every week could be realised at last. Lloyd then turned his attention to the efficiency of his production processes. In 1856, he imported two rotary presses made by Richard Hoe in New York that multiplied the speed of printing and were soon imported by the rest of Fleet Street. Then, exasperated by the unreliability of newsprint supplies, he decided to make his own. Having researched the paper trade, he went to Algeria to explore the potential of esparto grass as a raw material. He leased the harvesting rights to 100,000 acres and set up a paper mill at Bow Bridge in East London. In 1861, he started making all his own newsprint and was soon making enough to sell to other publishers. Lloyd's Weekly's circulation had risen to 170,000 by 1861, but it was soon to rise much more steeply. On 1 October 1861, the last duty on newspapers was abolished ‚Äì the paper duty of a penny halfpenny per pound in weight. Lloyd lowered the price to a penny two weeks before the duty was lifted. Even with the much improved production, the first issue sold out at 350,000. Regular circulation had risen to 412,080 by 1865Joseph Hatton, Journalistic London, p.194. and continued its upward path, passing the million mark in 1896 and reaching 1,500,000 during the 1914-18 war. As the century went on, Lloyd's Weekly attracted a sizeable readership in Australia and New Zealand. It also contained popular features that gave readers a feeling of personal connection with the paper. One was a section that answered readers' questions, many of which were legal, although the answers were often too cryptic to be much use to other readers. Another was a Lost Relatives column where missing persons could be traced through the good offices of fellow readers. In 1885, Lloyd's valued employee, Thomas Catling, took over the editorship. He was a keen supporter of William Gladstone and the Liberal Party. It is probably from this last period of Lloyd's life that his reputation as a stalwart Liberal Party supporter arose. The radicalism of Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly‚Äôs early years had been considerably toned down, but the paper's views on social issues were hard to reconcile with Gladstone's parsimonious approach to the spending of public money. However, by the 1880s, the party itself was dividing itself three ways ‚Äì the social reformers later led by David Lloyd George, the more traditional tendency of the Asquith faction and Gladstone's loyal supporters. Both this paper and Lloyd's other paper, the Daily Chronicle, generally supported the Lloyd George arm. Gladstone's promotion of home rule for Ireland created difficulties for Catling. Although unaligned radicals supported it, the policy was unpopular with the general public. Catling was torn between supporting Gladstone and the risk of offending readers. Lloyd was clear: readers always came first and, if enough of them defected, a new editor would have to be found. In 1889, Lloyd hatched a plan to revamp the paper. Its format had changed little since 1843. It had become feasible to leaven the text with line drawings as well as to print a longer paper without going broke. A delay in delivery of new printing presses (Richard Hoe had died in 1886) gave Lloyd a great deal of anxiety and he fell ill, probably from a heart attack. After a month or two convalescing, Lloyd returned to work. The plan was close to fruition in early 1890 when he again fell ill. This time he did not recover and he died on 8 April 1890, barely a month before the new-style Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly was ready to run. Catling retired in 1906 and was succeeded by Robert Donald, who was already editor of the Daily Chronicle. He continued until 1918 when Lloyd George bought out both Lloyd papers following the debacle over the Chronicle‚Äôs support for his adversary, Sir Frederick Maurice. After the takeover, Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly ceased to prosper. Its second editor from 1924 was Ernest Perris, who was also editor of the Chronicle. That did well under the new ownership, so it may be that steering two newspapers to success proved too much for him. The name had already been changed from Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly Newspaper to Lloyd‚Äôs Weekly News in 1902 and to Lloyd‚Äôs Sunday News in 1918. Lloyd‚Äôs was dropped in 1924. By the time of the 1929 financial crash, the two papers were enmeshed in a corporate muddle created by two further changes of ownership. The Cadbury family gave the Daily Chronicle an extended half-life in the News Chronicle until 1960. The Sunday News's potential saviour, the popular writer Edgar Wallace, failed to make a go of it in 1930. It folded in 1931 when Allied Newspapers bought the title and merged it into the Sunday Graphic. In its heyday, Lloyd's Weekly had been so popular that the music hall artiste, Mathilda Wood, changed her name to Marie Lloyd ‚Äúbecause everyone‚Äôs heard of Lloyd‚Äôs‚Äù.

The younger brother of Vincent Tchenguiz, he undertook a series of corporate deals, focusing particularly on property assets associated with UK pub and supermarket chains, during the 2000s. However, the value of some of his investments plunged during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, exacerbated by the collapse of his major financial backer, Iceland's Kaupthing Bank. He and his brother's businesses were also the target of a misdirected UK Serious Fraud Office enquiry and of various law suits. Early life Tchenguiz was born in Tehran, Iran, to an Iraqi-Jewish family, the son of Victor and Violet Khadouri.The Daily Telegraph: \\"Lisa Tchenguiz and Vivian Imerman: profiles\\" January 22, 2010 His family left Iraq in 1948 and settled in Iran, where his father, a jeweler, worked for the Shah and ran the country's mint. He also changed the family surname from Khadouri to Tchenguiz. In 1979 the family moved in England after the Iranian revolution. He has one brother, Vincent Tchenguiz, and one sister, Lisa Tchenguiz (formerly married to BBC Radio 1 disc jockey, Gary DaviesThe Daily Telegraph: \\"Just like Diana, I had three people in my marriage\\" By Bryony Gordon March 6, 2013 and then to South African-born Del Monte CEO, Vivian Imerman). Career Starting with an investment in a Hammersmith office block, the Tchenguiz family established Rotch Property Group, a highly leveraged business that \\"typically buys properties let long-term to blue-chip clients\\" and \\"relies on property values rising in a low-interest-rate environment\\". In a booming real estate market, they also applied an American financial engineering strategy of securitization: borrowing large sums against future cashflows from company assets, enabling them to access more debt, and on better terms (and much of it - reportedly over ¬£2 billion - from Iceland's Kaupthing Bank), than had been thought possible. Other businesses included the R20 investment vehicle and investment company London & Boston. =High street and pub chain investments= In 2001, the Tchenguiz brothers and Vivian Imerman, supported by a ¬£190 million loan from German investment bank WestLB, backed a 2001 management buyout of distiller Whyte & Mackay (in 2005 they bought remaining interests in the firm before selling the company to India- based United Spirits Limited for ¬£595m in 2007).ES Magazine: The grapes of wrath\\" by Mark HollingsworthHerald Scotland: \\"Imerman eyes a bid for Whyte & Mackay\\" by Greig Cameron 30 November 2013The Independent: \\"Vivian Imerman eyes Whyte & Mackay acquisition as Diageo agrees to sell over competition concerns\\" by Simon Neville 29 November 2013 Also in 2001, Robert Tchenguiz tabled a ¬£310m bid for Shell Mex House, a 1930s Art Deco building overlooking the Thames next to London's Savoy Hotel, and in 2003 bid to buy London's Selfridges but later (July 2003) withdrew his offer before launching bids to buy the Pubmaster pub chain and the Odeon cinema chain. After selling his Pubmaster stake to Punch Taverns, in 2004 he established the Globe Pub Company and acquired 364 pubs from Spirit Group, in a deal worth ¬£345m, and also bought the Laurel Pub Company for ¬£150m. In 2005 he bought the Yates's high street bar group for ¬£200m and then spent ¬£80m for 98 pubs from the SFI Group, which operated the Slug and Lettuce chain. Also in 2005, he was part of a consortium targeting the Somerfield supermarket chain. In 2006, he led a consortium targeting the Mitchells & Butlers pub chain, and while the initial bid was rebuffed, Tchenguiz continued to pursue M&B; in 2007 only for M&B; management to postpone a proposed property joint venture due to a credit crunch heralding the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. Deteriorating market conditions saw ¬£225m wiped off the value of Tchenguiz's investments in a single day in November 2007, and by January 2008, collapsed corporate deals and plunging stock market values were reported to have cut the paper value of three Tchenguiz investments (M&B;, supermarket chain Sainsbury's and computer games publisher SCi Entertainment) by over ¬£560m in less than 12 weeks. In March 2008, Tchenguiz's Laurel Pub Company collapsed into administration, but around 239 of pubs and restaurants were immediately acquired from the administrators in a deal financed by between ¬£50m and ¬£60m of credit provided by Tchenguiz. He continued to build his stake in M&B; in May 2008, but was reportedly sitting on a hefty loss as M&B; shares, once trading at nearly 900p, had fallen to 344p. In May 2008, Tchenguiz - holding 27% of the company's shares - got M&B; agreement to place property interests into a tax- efficient real estate investment trust once credit market conditions were favourable for refinancing. =Financial losses= However, by October 2008, under pressure from Kaupthing Bank, which had backed many of Tchenguiz's investments, he was forced to sell off holdings in M&B;, Sainsbury's, SCi Entertainment and other businesses, incurring substantial losses estimated at over ¬£800m. And in February 2009, Kaupthing announced it was suing Oscatello Investments, a British Virgin Islands-based holding company controlled by Tchenguiz, in relation to an unpaid overdraft of ¬£643m. In May 2009, Kaupthing followed up with a ¬£180m claim against Tchenguiz for proceeds from the sale of Somerfield \\\\- eventually settled in June 2010 with the Tchenguiz Discretionary Trust surrendering control of ¬£137m to Kaupthing's administrators. Meanwhile, in April 2009, Tchenguiz's Globe Pub Company faced administration after defaulting on a loan payment; the chain's 421 outlets were bought from the receivers by Heineken in October 2009. =SFO and other legal disputes= In the wake of the collapse of Kaupthing Bank, Robert Tchenguiz was suspected of fraudulent dealings and was arrested in a dawn raid in 2011; however, the investigation ended in 2012 with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) citing \\"insufficient evidence\\", and no indictment was ever brought. In fact, Tchenguiz lost millions of pounds in Kaupthing's collapse. Robert Tchenguiz sued the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for false imprisonment and damages to his businesses. Due to mishandling of the inquiry, the court had already ordered the SFO to pay 80% of Robert Tchenguiz's legal expenses in the matter. In 2014 the SFO settled with Tchenguiz for a sum of ¬£1.5m. However, Tchenguiz also took legal action against Grant Thornton and partners at the firm who he claimed had misled the SFO into investigating him and brother Vincent, though the dispute reportedly also created a rift between the brothers due to a legal row over administration of the Tchenguiz Family Trust; main beneficiary Vincent was accused by Robert of making false representations \\"of a serious nature\\" about him to Grant Thornton. The court action was eventually discontinued by Robert Tchenguiz in October 2018. The judge said all defendants could leave the court \\"with their reputation completely intact\\" as Tchenguiz's allegations had \\"completely failed\\"; while the court could not compel Tchenguiz to apologise, \\"it records unequivocally that it is warranted.\\" However, Tchenguiz said \\"I am definitely not providing an apology.\\" Tchenguiz's home, the former Royal College of Organists building. A legal dispute relating to Investec Trust Guernsey's handling of the Tchenguiz Discretionary Trust ended in an April 2018 judgement in favour of the Guernsey-based business, with Tchenguiz threatened with loss of his Kensington home, formerly housing the Royal College of Organists, as a result \\\\- though this threat was later reported to have been resolved. In July 2018, Robert Tchenguiz was said by a High Court judge to have lied regarding a ‚Ç¨2bn Santander Bank deal in a dispute involving Edgeworth Capital, a Tchenguiz- owned Luxembourg-registered company, and Aabar Investments, an Abu Dhabi investment business. Finding in favour of Aabar, the judge said Tchenguiz was \\"prepared to say whatever he thought would assist Edgeworth's case, without any regard for its truth.\\" =Resumption of activist shareholder activities= In September 2019, Tchenguiz sold one of his properties, the Quarry House office building in Leeds, to Legal & General for ¬£246m, part of an effort to raise funds to invest in new UK properties. During 2019, Tchenguiz built up a substantial shareholding in bus and rail company FirstGroup, and in November 2019 pushed for the group to be broken up. In December 2019, FirstGroup announced it was considering a sale of its north American businesses, leading Tchenguiz, holding 4.7% of the company, to claim a shareholders victory. However, following the March 2020 stock market crash due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tchnenguiz's ¬£28m stake in the group was sold. It was later reported that his investment had been funded by loans from City brokers including Intertrader, IG Group and CMC Markets, who called in the loans then sold the shares after Tchenguiz did not repay the loans; at least one of the brokers was said to be pursuing legal action for repayment. Also in November 2019, Tchenguiz campaigned to restructure AIM-listed real estate lender Urban Exposure in which his company, R20 Advisory, had built a 12.6% stake. In March 2020, under pressure from Tchenguiz, Urban Exposure was set to break itself up and sell its constituent parts. In May 2020, Tchenguiz submitted plans to Westminster City Council to convert the former headquarters of MI5 (Leconfield House in Curzon Street, Mayfair) into a 65-bedroom private members' hotel. Tchenguiz had bought the building for his Rotch property business in 2004 for about ¬£140 million. Personal life Tchenguiz once dated supermodel Caprice Bourret and was close to Diana, Princess of Wales. In 2005, he married his longtime girlfriend, American Heather Bird; they have two children. Though separated, they live in different parts of the same house by the Royal Albert Hall in Kensington, London. His girlfriend, Julia Dybowska, also lives in the house. Details about his domestic arrangements were aired in a May 2018 BBC documentary The Rise and Fall of the Playboy Billionaire, prompting Tchenguiz to threaten legal action against the BBC, and to appoint former Bell Pottinger CEO James Henderson as his PR advisor. In January 2018, Robert Tchenguiz was reported to have been on the invitation list to a controversial Presidents Club dinner in London.

Production After meeting Lighthouse at the Expo '70 festival in Osaka, Flower Travellin' Band were invited to visit Canada. While there, the group recorded Made in Japan with Lighthouse keyboardist Paul Hoffert helping produce. Vocalist Joe Yamanaka later stated that the process was very easy, with everything flowing well. Due to George Wada becoming ill with tuberculosis, Canadian drummer Paul Devon plays on some tracks on this album. The lyrics were written by Yoko Nomura, the wife of the band's manager, who translated conversations she had with the group and their ideas into English. \\"Heaven and Hell\\" was written by Yamanaka in Japanese and she translated it. The song \\"Hiroshima\\" is a re-imagining of \\"Satori Part III\\" from their previous album Satori. The introductory first track is an advertisement for a concert at Stanley Park Stadium by Flower Travellin' Band, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Bob Seger and Teegarden & Van Winkle, with a clip of \\"Lucky Man\\" playing in the background. \\"Hiroshima\\", \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Aw Give Me Air\\" were covered by Cult of Personality, 9, and punk band Pulling Teeth respectively, for the 2000 Flower Travellin' Band Tribute album. Reception Both Mason Jones of Dusted magazine and Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic claimed that following Satori was a difficult task and that Made in Japan was \\"doomed to fall short of expectations,\\" respectively. Both reviewers also cited the same three songs, \\"Kamikaze\\", \\"Hiroshima\\" and \\"Spasms\\", as the highlights and being on par with the band's best work. Although he felt it inconsistent, Rivadavia called the album \\"pretty darn good!\\" and gave it a 3.5 star rating out of 5.

It is a double album, featuring both live and studio recordings. Production After returning from Canada, Flower Travellin' Band began a new album. The mix of live and studio recordings was planned from the beginning. Wanting a mix of sounds, they tried acoustic pieces and experimented with material that would be hard to reproduce live. Growing as a band and as individuals, more individual contributions were made. Tracks 1, 2, 5, 7 and 8 were recorded live at Yokosuka Bunka Kaikan in Yokosuka on September 16, 1972, while track 9 is a live studio recording.

Reception Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic referred to Make Up as confused and \\"inconsistent to say the least\\", giving it a 3 star rating out of five. Aquarius Records and the Roadburn Festival were mostly positive in a review, writing that the first two sides show the band's more mellow and pop side, \\"with the gentle epic ‚ÄòLook at My Window‚Äô, the bluesy, balladic ‚ÄòShadows of Lost Days‚Äô, and the sad ‚ÄòBroken Strings‚Äô all probably prompting lighter-raising among concert goers.\\" But stated that the title-track, \\"Slowly But Surely\\" and \\"All the Days\\" provide heavier fare.

It describes Sarah Siddons, an actress Coleridge became fond of during his visits to London during college. The poem celebrates watching Siddons perform her various roles on stage. The actual authorship of the poem is uncertain, since it was attributed to Charles Lamb in various works. It is possible that Lamb and Coleridge worked on the poem together, and, if so, it would be one of Lamb's earliest works. Background Mrs Siddons, as Coleridge refers to her, was an actress that he became aware of during his college years. In his letters to his childhood friend Mary Evans, Coleridge would mention various performances that he witnessed when he would slip into London.Holmes 1989 p. 50 The sonnet dedicated to her, \\"To Mrs Siddons\\", is the eighth poem of Coleridge's Sonnets on Eminent Characters series, printed in the 29 December 1794 Morning Chronicle as written by Coleridge. However, it is uncertain as to who originally wrote the poem. In a letter written by Lamb in June 1796, he speaks of the poem as if it was originally written by him and edited by Coleridge. When the poem was printed in Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems, it is attributed to Lamb. When the poem was to be printed in Coleridge's 1803 edition of poems, Lamb did not claim ownership of the poem.Mays 2001 p. 164 The poem was edited by someone between its various printings but with few changes. The poem was also not included in Lamb's 1798 or 1818 collections of poems, but Coleridge did not include the poem in any of his later collections of poems. Although the true authorship is unknown, it is possible that the poem was jointly written by Coleridge and Lamb, and that neither was able to determine who had the true ownership over the poem. Lamb separated the poem from his other sonnets, and later editors attributed the work as a joint creation of both poems. J.C.C. Mays points out the evidence of a joint authorship and claims, \\"It is less likely that [Lamb] wrote it entirely, gave it to [Coleridge] to meet his newspaper obligations, and then had no interest in claiming it for his own, since he did think it worth preserving in [Coleridge's] 1803 volume.\\" Regardless of the role that each of the poets had within the poem, \\"To Mrs Siddons\\" is considered one of Lamb's earliest known poems.Lindop 1990 p. 109 However, the poems have been seen as different from Lamb's other poems, as William Hazlitt, Lamb's contemporary, points out: \\"Lamb's first compositions were in verse‚Äîproduced slowly, at long intervals,‚Äîand with self-distrust, which the encouragements of Coleridge could not subdue. With the exception of a sonnet to Mrs. Siddons, whose acting, [...] had made a deep impression upon him, they were exclusively personal.\\"Hazlitt 1854 p. 251 Poem The 1796 edition of the poem reads:Mays 2001 p. 165 Themes Of the various individuals that Coleridge's Sonnets on Eminent Characters discusses, representatives from the theatre industry was limited to Siddons, as an actress, and Richard Sheridan, a playwright.Holmes 1989 p. 81 Although Coleridge writes about her and many people viewed Siddons as an important actress, Siddons had little actual contact or involvement with the Romantic poets beyond knowing Walter Scott and once meeting Lord Byron.Parsons 1969 p. 259 The poem refers to various roles that Siddons, as an actress, would have played by discussing plays that she was a member. It is possible that these references are to William Shakespeare's Macbeth, Hamlet, or Richard III along with Nicholas Rowe's Tragedy of Jane Shore. Besides the allusions to plays, the beginning of the poem compares Siddons's acting having a power over Coleridge as a children's story. Coleridge's impression of Siddons would continue for years after; in February 1797 Coleridge started creating a play that he hoped that Siddons would have a part. The play, called Osorio, was later rejected by the producers at Drury Lane, the theatre that he hoped would perform the play.Holmes 1989 pp. 141, 174 Notes References * Hazlitt, William.

Midway through the season, he was averaging over 50 tackles a game, but was still mentally troubled by his knee reconstruction. \\"The lack of confidence in my knee goes to my head and sometimes it doesn't feel as strong as it should. I have thoughts of doing it again and the thought of six months of rehab again is scary, they're bad thoughts, and I won't lie they are always there in the back of my mind,\\" he said. In Round 20 against the Canberra Raiders, Taylor played his 100th career match and also scored a try in the Panthers 34‚Äì24 loss at Penrith Stadium. In Round 24 against the St George Illawarra Dragons, Taylor's season was ended due to a hand injury. Taylor finished the 2015 NRL season with 20 matches and a try.

On 2 May, Taylor joined the Wests Tigers effective immediately, after being released from his Panthers contract. Taylor played in 2 matches for the Panthers in 2016 before the shift to the Tigers. Taylor said, \\"They wanted me to be more aggressive in defence. That's what I was working on. I'm not the one to go out and put on a big shot or whack someone in a tackle. My strength is to consistently be there, wrestle and lead the line speed. But I realised I wasn't going to play first grade even though I thought I had done everything that was asked of me. I was a bit frustrated, but I'm not a person to get angry. I just wanted to play first grade again, so that's why I'm at the Tigers.\\" In Round 10, Taylor made his club debut for the Wests Tigers against the Bulldogs, starting at second-row in the 36‚Äì4 loss at ANZ Stadium.

He said, \\"Ivan coming in as head coach was a big factor in me deciding to stay. He's an experienced coach and has coached me at both the Warriors and Penrith, he's the reason I moved to Australia, knowing what kind of coach he is, what his principles are and the way he likes to play football was probably the biggest factor.\\" =2018= After the departure of Aaron Woods, Taylor was named as one of 5 co-captains at Wests Tigers, alongside Benji Marshall, Chris Lawrence, Russell Packer and Josh Reynolds. Coach Ivan Cleary said, \\"I just think it's the right model for us right now. When we started this preseason it was pretty obvious straight away that there was no real pecking order. There was no set culture to adhere to. It was all new.\\" =2020= On 28 September 2020, Taylor was one of eight players who were released by the Wests Tigers.

Origin Historian Niall Ferguson and economist Moritz Schularick first coined the term in late 2006, arguing that saving by the Chinese and overspending by Americans led to an incredible period of wealth creation that contributed to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. For years, China accumulated large currency reserves and channeled them into US government securities, which kept nominal and real long-term interest rates artificially low in the United States. Ferguson describes Chimerica as one economy which \\"accounts for around 13 percent of the world's land surface, a quarter of its population, about a third of its gross domestic product, and somewhere over half of the global economic growth of the past six years.\\" He suggests Chimerica could end if China were to decouple from the United States bringing with it a shift in global power and allowing China \\"to explore other spheres of global influence, from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, of which Russia is also a member, to its own informal nascent empire in commodity-rich Africa.\\" The accumulation of American debt, which has been estimated at over $800 billion, suggests the two nations are intrinsically linked; the economic symbiosis prevalent between the two suggests that separation would harm both countries and be disastrous for the global economy. Another way to measure this integration is the trade deficit. The US trade deficit with China was $295 billion in 2011, meaning the US imported that much more goods and services from China than it exported to China. The Economic Policy Institute estimated that from 2001 to 2011, 2.7 million US jobs were lost to China.\\"U.S. trade gap with China cost 2.7 million jobs\\", Reuters, August 23, 2012 The idea of Chimerica features prominently in Ferguson's 2008 book and adapted television documentary The Ascent of Money, which reviews the history of money, credit, and banking. The concept of Chimerica supplements and/or supplants Nichibei, or the similarly constructed Japan-U.S. economic model and relationship that had been prominent in years before the development of Chimerica.

An additional officer was charged with the responsibility of assembling the evidence the three officers would use in making their determination, and with the responsibility to present that information to the three officers. For the CSR Tribunals that officer was known as the \\"Recorder\\", and was always a military lawyer. The Recorders were Majors, Lieutenant Commanders, Lieutenant Colonels or Commanders. The Presidents of the CSR Tribunals were always Colonels or Captains. CSR Tribunals added a fifth officer, the Personal Representative, whose responsibility was to meet with the captive, try to explain the CSR Tribunal process to them, learn their account of themselves, and present their account to the Tribunal if the captive chose not to attend, or proved unable to present their account themselves.

Description The community is located on the south shore of the Great Salt Lake and is served by Interstate 80 and Utah State Route 36. Lake Point is north of Tooele. The community was originally settled in 1854 under the name of E.T. City, in honor of Ezra T. Benson. It was renamed Lake Point in 1923. History Lake Point sits on a passageway, a narrow strip of land between the sharply towering Oquirrh Mountains to the southeast, and the waters of the Great Salt Lake on the north. Early explorers, indigenous groups, and California-bound trekkers followed this route.The ill-fated Donner Party used this route in 1846. The Gushute Indian Tribe used the Tooele Valley for their yearly rendezvous.Early History of the Lake Point Area, Lake Point Through The Years 1854-1986, Lake Point Ward, Stansbury Park Utah Stake, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, published 1986. The US Army sent Captain Howard Stansbury to the area in 1849 to evaluate emigration trails and scout for possible passages for a transcontinental railroad. He had a small adobe house built near a prominent rock outcropping in the southwest part of the area, for the use of his herders who cared for his expedition's livestock; in subsequent years the rocks became known as \\"Adobe Rock\\". Pioneers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who settled in the Tooele Valley were organized on April 24, 1850 into a branch of the Church by Ezra T. Benson (John Rowberry was called as president of the branch). By mid-1854, E. T. City had been established in the area. One of the first settlers, Peter Maughan, dismantled his log cabin in Tooele and moved it to the new settlement in August 1854. Others built small houses along the north-south road during the next three years. However, by 1857, a three-year string of crop failures had caused most of the population to move away. Maughan moved his family to Cache Valley. The first meetinghouse of the LDS branch was built in 1857, a small log building with a rough board floor, dirt roof, and two windows. The branch's population was listed as 97 in 1868 (\\"and some gentile families\\"); by then the E.T. Irrigation Company had been formed, a canal delivered irrigation water from the Mill Pond, a regular mail run existed between E.T. City and Richville. A railroad line was begun from the bustling mining area around Stockton to the south shore of the Great Salt Lake by 1870, connecting with a steamboat run from Corinne at the north end of the lake. An investor, Jeter Clinton, worked to transform the port into a recreation area, known as \\"Clinton Beach\\". In 1871 he had constructed a temporary building, Lake House, that provided showers and refreshments for tourists. In the fall Clinton replaced the structure with a hotel. However, few people took advantage of the facilities,Advertisements in Salt Lake City newspapers read \\"spend a whole day on the south shore, to visit the caves and grottoes near Lake Point, enjoy surf bathing, and hunting....\\" and in 1872 the steamboat service was halted. The Steamboat Era Was Glamorous But Brief, utah.gov However, the railway construction continued, and was completed in 1877. In 1892 the Clinton property was sold to the Buffalo Park Land Company, who envisioned a large resort on the area. They mapped streets, planted trees, imported buffalo, and began building cabins. However, the venture did not succeed, and the remaining buffalo became the nucleus of the buffalo herd on nearby Antelope Island. An LDS Church meetinghouse built of rock was completed in 1884. It was also used as an elementary school until 1894, when a separate schoolhouse was constructed. The rock LDS chapel was replaced in November 1985 by a modern brick-faced building a half-mile south of the previous building.

Mintz (10 October 1911 ‚Äì 4 November 1976) was a record store owner in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, who was instrumental in the early establishment, marketing and promotion of rock and roll music. He was born in Cleveland. Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Marriage Records and Indexes, 1810-1973 for Leo Mintz, ref A30742 In 1938, while working as assistant manager at an army surplus store, he decided to set up a record shop, Record Rendezvous, on Prospect Avenue in Cleveland, on the edge of the city's black community. Initially, this sold used jukebox records, which Mintz purchased through regular visits to a warehouse in Columbus. At the store, he was among the first to put records in boxes which customers could browse through, rather than having to ask for songs by name. He also provided listening booths so that customers could hear the records before purchasing them, and encouraged in-store promotional appearances by recording artists. The store became known as the \\"'Vous\\". By about 1950, Mintz noticed an increase in the number of white teenagers sifting through his boxes, listening and dancing to rhythm and blues records, such as those by Ruth Brown, Wynonie Harris and Fats Domino, which had been marketed to African Americans. However, they rarely purchased them because of the stigma attached by some to \\"race records\\". He persuaded radio presenter Alan Freed to play the records, initially as novelties on WAKR-AM in Akron, and then in 1951 on a new radio show which Mintz helped him to secure at WJW-AM in Cleveland. Mintz sponsored Freed's radio programme, The Moondog Show, and supplied many of the records played. Several sources claim that Mintz, rather than Freed as is usually suggested, was the first to use the term \\"rock and roll\\" - a phrase quite commonly used in the records - to describe the music and, in particular, to promote it to white audiences. According to one source, one night while he was on air, Freed turned to Mintz and said, \\"Leo, this music is so exciting, we‚Äôve got to call it something.\\" Mintz replied, \\"Alan, you are rolling tonight...you're rocking and rolling...call it 'rock and roll.'\\" Mintz also sponsored Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball in March 1952, often regarded as the first rock'n'roll concert. Freed left Cleveland for New York in 1954. Mintz expanded the chain of Record Rendezvous stores to five by the 1960s, and continued to operate them until a few months before his death in 1976.

Biography Leray was born in Ch√¢teaugiron, Ille-et-Vilaine, to Ren√© and Marie (n√©e Roncin) Leray. He studied at the College of Rennes from 1833 until 1844, when he accepted an appeal for missionaries in Louisiana, United States. Following his arrival, he taught for several months at Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, before entering St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland, where he completed his theological studies. In 1852 he accompanied Bishop John J. Chanche to Natchez, Mississippi, where Leray was ordained to priesthood on March 19 of that year. He then served as pastor of Jackson, and ministered to the sick and dying during the yellow fever epidemics of 1853 and 1855. Leray himself was stricken by the fever and only by great care did he recover. In 1857 he was named pastor of Vicksburg, where he built the first Catholic church and in 1860 introduced the Sisters of Mercy to establish a school. During the Civil War (1861-1865), he served as a chaplain to the Confederate Army of Tennessee. On several occasions he was taken prisoner by Union forces but was released as soon as he was identified as a priest. After the war he returned to Vicksburg, which was visited by cholera in 1867. He was also vicar general of Diocese of Natchez from 1871 to 1877. On November 27, 1876, Leray was appointed the second Bishop of Natchitoches, Louisiana, by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on April 22, 1877 from Cardinal Geoffroy Brossais Saint-Marc, with Bishop C√©lestine Guynemer de la Hailandi√®re and Charles Nouvel de La Fl√®che serving as co-consecrators, at Rennes Cathedral. Leray remained in Natchitoches for only two years, being named Coadjutor Archbishop of New Orleans and Titular Archbishop of Ionopolis on October 23, 1879. He was also charged with the administration of the financial affairs of the Archdiocese, which was left nearly $600,000 in debt from the war; he managed to reduce this debt by at least half. Upon the death of Archbishop Napol√©on- Joseph Perch√©, Leray succeeded him as the third Archbishop of New Orleans on December 28, 1883. He received the pallium, a vestment worn by metropolitan bishops, from Cardinal James Gibbons in January 1884. Leray attended the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in November 1884, and continued his efforts to relieve New Orleans of its immense debt for the rest of his tenure. An advocate of Catholic education, he increased the number of parochial schools from 36 to 70 during his administration as well. In the hope of strengthening his failing health, he returned in 1887 to his native Ch√¢teaugiron, where he died shortly afterwards at age 62.

In addition, this unexplained event spawns numerous ‚Äúsea monsters,‚Äù including sea serpents, giant lobsters, and man-eating jellyfish. The wealthy Henry Dashwood lives on his estate, Norland Park, with his second wife and their three daughters - Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret. Dashwood embarks on a journey to discover the source of The Alteration, but is attacked by a hammerhead shark and killed. Upon his death the estate passes not to Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters but rather to Mr. Dashwood's son John, the child of his first wife. Before expiring from his shark wounds, the elder Dashwood asks John to take care of his stepmother and half-sisters. John initially agrees to do so but is soon influenced by his greedy wife Fanny into giving the girls nothing at all. John and Fanny move into Norland, prompting the scorned Dashwood women to seek living space elsewhere. Mrs. Dashwood's cousin Sir John Middleton invites her to stay at a cottage situated on an archipelago off the coast of Devonshire. Although Devonshire is considered to have England's highest concentration of sea monsters, Mrs. Dashwood accepts the offer and the four women relocate to a windswept shanty known as Barton Cottage. Here they are treated kindly by Sir John, who invites them to dine at his heavily fortified manor house on nearby Deadwind Island. They are soon introduced to Sir John's family and friends, including his wife (a former island princess whom Sir John kidnapped and carried back to Britain and makes an escape attempt every couple of weeks), her mother (also kidnapped by Sir John and now calling herself ‚ÄúMrs. Jennings‚Äù), and Colonel Brandon, a quiet and reserved gentleman who is also a part-man, part-squid mutant. The move to Barton Cottage serves to separate Elinor from Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars. The unassuming and somewhat unremarkable Edward is clearly attracted to Elinor, and she to him, but Fanny makes it clear that their wealthy mother would never tolerate a marriage between Edward and the poor Elinor, insisting instead that he be married off to a woman of high rank and great wealth. Edward visits Elinor at Norland just before the move, and his reserved behavior makes her wonder if he is truly interested in her. His subsequent failure to visit her at her new island home only reinforces this suspicion. In contrast to Elinor's woes, Marianne soon finds two suitors. Colonel Brandon is smitten with her, but she finds his age (35) and his tentacle-covered face to be repulsive. While out for a walk, Marianne falls into a rain-swollen creek and is attacked by an octopus. She is saved by the handsome John Willoughby, a dashing adventurer and deep-sea diver who has come to the archipelago to visit his aunt. The two of them are soon inseparable and Elinor begins to suspect that the two are planning on getting engaged. Unfortunately for Marianne, Willoughby is suddenly called away to the undersea city of Sub-Marine Station Beta, leaving her heartbroken and alone. Edward Ferrars finally pays a visit to the Dashwoods at Barton Cottage, but his continued unhappiness and reserved nature lead Elinor to decide that he no longer has feelings for her. Given her mother's sorrow at being banished to the forlorn Devonshire coast and Marianne's sorrow at being abandoned by Willoughby, Elinor decides that she must hide her own sorrow for the good of the family. Elinor is soon dealt a double shock when Lady Middleton's cousins, Anne and Lucy Steele, come to visit. While out rowing, Elinor and Lucy are attacked by a fearsome sea serpent known as the Devonshire Fang-Beast, and the two barely escape with their lives. In the middle of the desperate struggle, Lucy informs Elinor that she has been engaged to Edward for more than four years. Elinor again hides her true feelings and wishes Lucy the best; secretly, she believes that Edward is only engaged to Lucy out of a sense of honor and duty and hopes for the two of them to somehow break the engagement. To cheer up the two elder Dashwood sisters, Mrs. Jennings offers to take them to Sub-Marine Station Beta. (There was an earlier Sub-Marine Station Alpha located in the Irish Sea, but it was destroyed by a treacherous merman.) The Station is a massive iron and glass undersea dome housing a large city, public gardens, shops, and a research laboratory where scientists plot new ways to defeat their aquatic enemies. Here Marianne attempts to renew her courtship with Willoughby, only to find him cold and unresponsive to her advances. When Willoughby leaves Marianne to fend for herself against an attack of giant lobsters, she demands an answer from him, and gets one: she learns that he is engaged to the very wealthy Miss Grey, news which leaves Marianne devastated. She admits to Elinor that she and Willoughby were never officially engaged, but his attentions towards her led her to believe that he loved her and would eventually marry her. Meanwhile, the truth about Willoughby's real character starts to emerge; Colonel Brandon tells Elinor that Willoughby had seduced Brandon's ward, fifteen-year-old Eliza Williams, and then abandoned her in a most cruel way - playfully burying her up to her neck in sand, then leaving her. Colonel Brandon was once in love with Miss Williams' mother, a woman who resembled Marianne and whose life was destroyed by an unhappy arranged marriage to the Colonel's brother. The Steele sisters arrive at Sub-Marine Station Beta along with John and Fanny Dashwood, Edward, and Edward's mother. Lucy is overjoyed when Edward's mother prefers her to Elinor, but her happiness is soon ruined when Anne lets it slip that Edward and Lucy are engaged. Edward is immediately disinherited and his fortune passes to his brother; however, Elinor and her friends respect Edward's choice of love and honor over money. Colonel Brandon offers Edward a modest income as a lighthouse keeper to help him get started on a new life. The vacation at Sub- Marine Station Beta is abruptly ended when schools of swordfish begin ramming the glass dome in the hopes of breaking it. They eventually succeed with the help of a narwhal and other sea creatures; the Dashwood sisters and their friends barely manage to escape before the dome breaks and floods. While riding an emergency ferry to the surface, Elinor encounters Edward's brother Robert and is disheartened to see that Robert cares more for his newfound inheritance than for the fate of his brother. The sisters and Mrs. Jennings retire to the Cleveland, a houseboat owned by Mrs. Jennings‚Äô son-in-law (and Sir John's fellow mercenary) Mr. Palmer. Soon after arriving, a depressed Marianne is attacked by mosquitoes and develops malaria. The Palmers leave for their own safety, and only after they are gone does Elinor realize the sudden danger they are in; the area around the Cleveland is home to the bloodthirsty Pirate Dreadbeard, and Dreadbeard's friendship with Mr. Palmer is the only thing keeping them safe. Without Palmer, the Cleveland and the Dashwood sisters are at the mercy of the pirates. As Marianne is deathly ill and unable to move, Colonel Brandon volunteers to swim to Barton Cottage and return with Mrs. Dashwood. This leaves Elinor and Mrs. Jennings to defend the Cleveland. Hearing of Marianne's illness, Willoughby journeys to the Cleveland and helps Elinor booby-trap the vessel; he also explains that when torn between love of Marianne and the lure of Miss Grey's wealth, he chose the latter and was deeply regretful about it. Willoughby departs just as Pirate Dreadbeard and his men arrive. Elinor and Mrs. Jennings bravely defend their ship, and Elinor summons a swarm of octopodes using a special whistle that she has obtained from Willoughby. Dreadbeard's men are soon massacred by the tentacled monsters, while the Pirate himself is killed by the returning Colonel Brandon. Marianne recovers from her malaria. Elinor passes along Willoughby's confession, and Marianne admits that she could never have been truly happy being married to such a selfish man. She points out that the combination of her wish for death and her deadly illness was morally equivalent to attempting suicide, and resolves to model herself after Elinor. A servant reports to the Dashwoods that Mr. Ferrars has married Lucy. Elinor is overcome by pain and visions of a five-pointed star; upon reflection, she realizes that the pain and visions have been with her (and always appear most forcefully) whenever Lucy is around. Sir John surmises that Lucy must be a sea witch - a monster that seduces human men and sucks the marrow from its victim's bones. Before Elinor can form a plan to save Edward, he arrives at Barton Cottage. The Dashwoods learn that it was Robert Ferrars, not Edward, that married Lucy. They resolve to leave Robert to his terrible fate. The happy occasion is literally upended when the island upon which Barton Cottage rests suddenly rises from the ocean; it turns out to be not an island at all, but rather a monstrous sea-beast known as Leviathan, awakened from a long slumber and hungry for all sorts of marine life. The characters survive their sudden upheaval from their former island home. Edward reconciles with his mother and asks Elinor to marry him; and she agrees. The couple begin a simple new life tending to the lighthouse at Delaford. Marianne resolves to become a marine engineer so that she can design a new Sub-Marine Station Gamma dome. Despite herself, she comes to fall in love with Colonel Brandon, and the two eventually marry. Willoughby, somewhat to his dismay, is forgiven by his aunt for his treatment of Eliza and reclaims his inheritance. He realizes that had he married Marianne for love instead of Miss Grey for money, he would have eventually attained both love and money. Instead he is left to ponder what might have been. Promotion The novel was initially announced via a YouTube video on 13 July 2009; it has had over 400,000 views since it was uploaded. It features cover art similar to its predecessor‚Äîin that it appears to take a work of art and transform it into the theme of the novel. However, with Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters, the image is created by the artist. Reception Entertainment Weekly gave Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters a rating of B- (in contrast to a rating of A- for Pride and Prejudice and Zombies), wondering \\"(c)an it be that in the rush to turn a charming book novelty into a renewable resource, the whole Austen-and-monsters series has already jumped the shark?\\" The A.V. Club gave the novel a favorable review and a grade of A-, approving of Winters' \\"aggressive approach to transforming his assigned text into horror\\" and commenting that \\"instead of destroying the integrity of Austen‚Äôs subtle romance, Winters‚Äô mysterious chanting natives, sea-witch curses, and undersea habitats move the story into a gothic realm\\". New York Magazine gave the novel a mixed review, stating that \\"It‚Äôs hard to say, in the end, if this is an homage, an exploitation, a deconstruction, or just a 300-page parlor trick. Although the sea-monster subplots, considered independently, rarely rise above pulp clich√©s, the book‚Äôs best moments do achieve a kind of bizarro symbiosis.\\" The novel is the subject of literary analysis in the 2019 collection of essays, Jane Austen and Comedy. In an essay in the book, Misty Krueger argues for the value of the monster mashup as a form of Austen adaptation. Krueger states that readers should \\"have fun with Sea Monsters‚Äô incongruous, carnivalesque doppelgangers and then...revisit Sense and Sensibility\\" to learn more about Austen's characters.

The film is a portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son. The film was widely praised by critics and won the Golden Astor for Best Film at the 2008 Mar del Plata International Film Festival. Plot The Yokoyama family come together every year to commemorate the death of the eldest son, Junpei, who accidentally drowned 12 years ago while saving the life of a boy. His father Kyohei, a retired doctor, and mother Toshiko are joined by their surviving son Ryota, who has recently married a widow (Yukari) with a young son (Atsushi), and their daughter Chinami, her husband and their children. Ryota resents knowing that Junpei was the favorite son, whose belongings are still left untouched by Toshiko, and that his parents attribute positive memories of him to Junpei; a bitter Kyohei, who is still mourning his son, has always been disappointed that Ryota went into art restoration instead of becoming a doctor and taking over the family business like Junpei. Meanwhile, Chinami pushes the idea of moving her family in with her ageing parents in order to take care of them. Kyohei and Toshiko are initially distant and cold to Yukari, openly believing it to be bad luck for Ryota to marry a widow, but eventually warm up to her and the shy Atsushi due to Yukari's kindness and push to bond. The family spends the day reminiscing and discussing their personal lives and careers, though Ryota only privately reveals to Yukari that he is struggling to find gainful employment in his field of art restoration. Ryota tries to confront his father after he catches Kyohei advising Atsushi to go into medicine, but Kyohei rebuffs his attempts. In the evening, they are visited by Yoshio, the boy Junpei died rescuing 12 years ago. The meeting is strained and uncomfortable; most of the family is angry and disappointed that Yoshio, now 25, is fat, lazy, and aimless, and believe that he should have died instead of Junpei. Only Ryota, who empathizes with feeling inferior to Junpei, defends him, and implores Toshiko to stop inviting him and making him feel guilty over Junpei's death. Toshiko refuses, telling him that Junpei's death would be too much to bear without having someone to blame for it, and that being reminded of the death once a year is the least Yoshio can do. Chinami and her family depart for home, and the rest of the family gather for dinner. Yukari asks questions about Toshiko and Kyohei's marriage, which reveals years of mutual resentment and disappointment, though the couple is nevertheless committed to each other. Toshiko reveals the couple's personal romantic song, which Kyohei forgot existed. At night, a butterfly gets into the house and lands on Junpei's picture; Toshiko believes it is Junpei, and though Ryota is too cynical to agree, he captures and releases the butterfly outside. Toshiko advises Ryota to have a child with Yukari as soon as possible so that it will be harder for them to divorce. During the night, the Yokoyama's neighbor makes an emergency call due to chest pains, and Kyohei advises her to call an ambulance before watching her be taken away to the same hospital that had put his family clinic out of business. Ryota, Yukari, and Atsushi leave in the morning. Though Kyohei and Toshiko look forward to seeing them for New Year's, Ryota and Yukari privately agree to renege on the meeting. As they drive away, Ryota explains in a voiceover that Toshiko died a few years later, with Kyohei passing away shortly after, without Chinami moving in or Ryota having fulfilled the promises he made to them earlier during the reunion. The film ends with Ryota's family  now including a young daughter  tending to the Yokoyama family graves, with Ryota continuing the same rituals and sayings that his mother once taught him.

On the same disk, a short \\"making of\\" supplement showed how many of the film's scenes were brought to life from the script during rehearsals or invented outright while shooting on location in what appeared to be the Yokohama area south of Tokyo. Reception Still Walking received wide acclaim from film critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 100% approval rating based on 64 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.32/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Hirokazu Kore-eda's film may seem modest at first, but this family drama casts a delicate, entrancing spell\\". In a Chicago Sun-Times review, Roger Ebert gave the work four stars and touted that Kore-eda is an heir of Yasujir≈ç Ozu. Trevor Johnston of Sight & Sound wrote that \\"however one positions Still Walking in the firmament of Japan's cinematic achievements, one thing is sure: it belongs up there with the masters.\\" The film won the Asian Film Award for Best Director, and was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.

He was born in Scotland and immigrated to Canada. By the time of the 1901 census he was living in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan with his wife.

After two terms in the Saskatchewan legislature, McDonald switched to federal politics and contested the federal riding of Prince Albert in the 1925 federal election and was elected with more than 50% of the vote defeating both incumbent Progressive MP Andrew Knox and John Diefenbaker, the Conservative candidate and future prime minister. The federal Liberals were re-elected with a minority government. Despite having fewer seats than the Conservatives they were able to stay in power with the support of Progressive and independent MPs. However, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King was personally defeated in his riding of York North and needed to find a new constituency. On January 15, 1926, McDonald agreed to resign his seat immediately after his election so that Mackenzie King could contest it in a by-election which was held a month later. McDonald returned to his pharmacy and eventually moved to British Columbia. In December 1935, Prime Minister Mackenzie King, who had just been returned to government after five years of Tory rule, appointed McDonald to the Canadian Senate as a representative for British Columbia. However, McDonald's tenure was short lived as he died in office less than a year later.

The Johanniter Orde in Nederland and the Johanniterorden i Sverige were formerly commanderies of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg. They became independent orders under the respective monarchs in 1946. As John Brooke-Little (when Norroy and Ulster King of Arms) later put into writing, the principal impetus for the concordat of 1961 was not ecumenism or brotherhood: it was signed because none of the few remaining legitimate orders of Saint John could effectively shield themselves from the claims of the self- styled orders while the legitimate orders continuously debated among themselves which of them was legitimate. This concordat led to the establishment of the Alliance of the Orders of St. John.Convention signed in Niederweisel, Germany, on the 13th of June, 1961.

DiCesare worked with him on his \\"Shower of Stars\\" concert series that featured several headline acts booked together to sell out large venues. On September 14, 1964 Tormey and DiCesare brought the Beatles to the Pittsburgh Civic Arena11 during their first U.S. Tour. DiCesare put up the $5000 guarantee. He got the money from his father, who had to put a lien on his house to borrow money from the Westinghouse Electric Credit Union11. The show sold out at a price of $5.90 per ticket. DiCesare had to miss the show because he had been drafted by the U.S. Army. Tormey worked the show while DiCesare was in Fort Sill, Oklahoma11. In 1965, DiCesare co-founded Sports Illustrated the Dapper Dan Roundball Classic with his friend Sonny Vaccaro.

Cortesi earlier served as nuncio to Paraguay in the interim. Cortesi was the only nuncio to Poland never to become a cardinal. Biography As nuncio to Paraguay, Cortesi arranged a prisoner exchange between Paraguay and Bolivia during the Chaco War in 1934.New York Times. 1934, February 7. \\"To Aid Wounded Exchange\\". p. 11. As nuncio in Buenos Aires, Cortesi presented the Supreme Order of Christ, the highest papal order, to Argentine President Agust√≠n Pedro Justo on behalf of Pope Pius XII later that year.New York Times. 1934, December 14. \\"Pope Honors Argentine Chief\\". p. 16. On April 30, 1939, on the eve of the German invasion of Poland, Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione sent a messageworded by Mussolini and personally approved by Pius XIIto Cortesi supporting the return of Danzig to Germany.Cornwell, 1999, p. 231. Cortesi replied by cable, questioning the wisdom of such a concession, but Maglione ordered him to pass it on to the Polish president. The following day Pius XII issued a \\"last appeal in favor of peace\\" entreating the \\"governments of Germany and Poland do their utmost to avoid every incident and abstain from taking any step capable for worsening the present tension\\". Cortesi submitted Pius XII's mediation plan to Foreign Minister J√≥zef Beck, but received \\"an evasive answer because the Poles do not favor mediation as a means of solving the Danzig problem\\".Jerzy Szapiro. 1939, May 10. \\"Poland Skeptical of Mediation Plan\\". New York Times. p. 17. Cortesi arrived in Rome on June 22 with noncommital replies from all five countries involved in the mediation, and met with Maglione over the mediation and also the rift between Polish and German Catholics.Camille M. Cianfarra. 1939, June 22. \\"Poland Answers Pope's Peace Plea\\". New York Times. p. 12. On June 26, Cortesi met with Pius XII personally to convey the negative reactions of President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki and Foreign Minister Beck to Pius XII's proposal to transfer Danzig to Germany.New York Times. 1939, June 27. \\"Nuncio to Warsaw is Received by Pope\\". p. 12. Cortesi's relaying of Pius XII's proposal to give Danzig to Germany was long remembered in Poland, particularly when the Communist government came into conflict with the pope after the war.Edward A. Morrow. 1949, September 7. \\"Poland's Press Replies to Pope\\". New York Times. p. 11. Cortesi fled his Warsaw nunciature on September 5, following the Polish government-in-exile and arriving in Bucharest.Gallagher, 2008, p. 95. The Vatican received word from Cortesi on September 22 from Bucharest, having been \\"completely cut off from the Catholics in Poland\\".New York Times. 1939, September 23. \\"Future of Poland Worries Vatican\\". p. 5. At that time, all the Polish bishopswith the exception of Cardinal August Hlond, the primate of Poland (who was at that time expected to return soon)were still in their bishoprics. Although Pius XII said that he would not formally recognize the government-in-exile (then in Paris) until he received a full report from Cortesi, Kazimierz Pap√©e, the ambassador from Poland, remained accredited to the Holy See.1939, October 4. \\"Pope May Recognize Poles' Paris Regime\\". p. 11. Pius XII recognized the government-in-exile \\"with as much formality as is possible under the circumstances\\" on October 7, aided by the \\"convenient fact\\" that Cortesi was due to retire and could not return to Warsaw in any case.New York Times. 1939, October 8. \\"Pope Recognizes the Polish Regime\\". p. 34. The New York Times reported that Cortesi \\"will not return to Warsaw even if a new Polish state is formed, but will return to Rome and await his almost certain elevation to the Cardinalate\\". The Times also reported that the nuncio to Paris would be made internuncio to the government-in-exile to avoid having to formally replace Cortesi.Herbert L. Matthews. 1939, October 11. \\"Italians Abandon Hopes for Peace\\". New York Times. p. 4.

New York Times letter to the editor. p. A18. The Vatican attempted to get the Nazis to greenlight Cortesi's returnas an apostolic visitor (a step below recognition of sovereignty). From Romania, Cortesi organized a relief effort to Poland. Cortesi eventually arrived in Rome, leaving Cesare Orsenigo, the nuncio to Germany, as the de facto nuncio to Poland.Spector, 2004, p. 517. On November 1, 1939, Orsenigo's authority was formally extended to Poland.Blet and Johnson, 1999, p. 72.

Ridged chips are used because they tend to be more sturdy and can hold the heavy chocolate. It also allows the chocolate flavor to be enhanced as the chocolate is allowed to build between the ridges of the chip. The kind of chocolate used is usually milk chocolate that is easily tempered for coating other foods. The tempering of chocolate is to lend an attractive, glossy appearance to the chocolate after it has been melted to the consistency for dipping.

He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide football team from 2009 to 2011. Up until a career ending injury, Murphy was considered one of the top defensive tackles in his class. High school career Murphy attended Hoover High School in Alabama, where he made 142 tackles and 16 sacks in junior and senior seasons. A dominant force in the middle, Murphy helped Hoover to two straight Class 6A State Championships in 2005 and 2006. During that period, Hoover was featured on the MTV show Two-A-Days. After receiving All-American honors by Parade as a senior, Murphy was selected to play in the 2006 Alabama North-South All-Star Game as well as the 2006 US Army All- American Bowl. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Murphy was listed as the No. 4 defensive tackle prospect in the nation. He was also ranked as the No. 2 prospect from Alabama, behind only fellow Crimson Tide teammate Rolando McClain. Murphy chose Alabama over Auburn, Clemson, Miami, and Louisville, becoming the first commitment Nick Saban received after his hiring in January 2007. College career After originally signing with the University of Alabama in the spring of 2007, Murphy failed to qualify that year, and after spending a year at Hargrave Military Academy, he missed again in 2008. Murphy signed one more time with the Crimson Tide in 2008, stayed another semester at Hargrave, then took more classes at Hoover's Cahaba School to raise his grade point average enough to meet NCAA eligibility standards. He finally enrolled at Alabama in January 2009, and was a third-string back up for senior nose tackle Terrence Cody during the 2009 season. Murphy was unable to finish the 2010 season due to injury and was placed on medical hardship for the 2011 season. Murphy's injuries ended up being career ending as he never returned to play football. He continued his academic career at the University of Alabama and graduated on August 3, 2013. Murphy is now a car salesman at Mercedes-Benz of Birmingham in Hoover, Alabama.

History The website was created by Riya, a company built to create a search engine used to search for similar faces among photos. The company found it difficult to monetize the service, however, so they created Like.com to use the same technology for a different purpose. Riya's CEO, Munjal Shah, noted that \\"the same technology works well to find similar-looking products.\\" Riya's CTO and co-founder, Burak G√∂kt√ºrk, had previously worked with computer vision technology and has filed for two dozen facial-recognition patents under his name. The website was first announced at the Web 2.0 Conference on November 8, 2006. Like.com raised US$19.5 million from investors who included Bay Partners, BlueRun Ventures, and Leapfrog Ventures. The company planned to make money by acting as an affiliate to the retail sites that it links to, allowing it to receive about a 10% commission on each sale that the website sent to an online retailer. As of November 2006, the website had about two million unique products from 200 merchants. In 2015, the site became defunct and redirected users to Google's shopping search engine. Features Since launching, the website has only allowed users to search for jewelry, handbags, shoes, and watches. Users can browse the website to find a product that they are interested in, or one that looks similar to what they are looking for. They can then choose to use the website to search its database for similar-looking products. The website then returns the results with links to retailers such as Amazon.com and Zappos. With the results, users can highlight parts of a product image to find other products with similar patterns, shapes, and colors. Each of the three criterion can be ranked to determine the importance of each according to the user. Like.com is planning to allow users to upload their own photos for the website to analyze and return similar-looking products. They wish to also allow users to upload photos taken in places such as stores with a mobile device, so that they can search for the product online at a cheaper price.

It can be constructed by performing the following steps: # Choose any complex number on the unit circle whose argument (complex angle) is not a rational fraction of œÄ, # Repeatedly square that number. This repetition (iteration) produces a sequence of complex numbers that can be described alone by their complex angle. Any choice of starting angle that satisfies (1) above will produce an extremely complicated sequence of angles, that belies the simplicity of the steps. It can be shown that the sequence will be chaotic, i.e. it is sensitive to the detailed choice of starting angle.  Chaos and the complex squaring map  The informal reason why the iteration is chaotic is that the angle doubles on every iteration and doubling grows very quickly as the angle becomes ever larger, but angles which differ by multiples of 2œÄ (radians) are identical. Thus, when the angle exceeds 2œÄ, it must wrap to the remainder on division by 2œÄ. Therefore, the angle is transformed according to the dyadic transformation (also known as the 2x mod 1 map). As the initial value z0 has been chosen so that its argument is not a rational multiple of œÄ, the forward orbit of zn cannot repeat itself and become periodic. More formally, the iteration can be written as: : \\\\qquad z_{n+1} = z_n^2 where z_n is the resulting sequence of complex numbers obtained by iterating the steps above, and z_0 represents the initial starting number. We can solve this iteration exactly: : \\\\qquad z_n = z_0^{2^n} Starting with angle Œ∏, we can write the initial term as z_0 = \\\\exp(i\\\\theta) so that z_n = \\\\exp(i2^n\\\\theta). This makes the successive doubling of the angle clear. (This is equivalent to the relation z_n = \\\\cos(2^n\\\\theta)+i \\\\sin(2^n\\\\theta).)  Generalisations  This map is a special case of the complex quadratic map, which has exact solutions for many special cases.M. Little, D. Heesch (2004), Chaotic root-finding for a small class of polynomials, Journal of Difference Equations and Applications, 10(11):949-953. The complex map obtained by raising the previous number to any natural number power z_{n+1} = z_n^p is also exactly solvable as z_n = z_0^{p^n}. In the case p = 2, the dynamics can be mapped to the dyadic transformation, as described above, but for p > 2, we obtain a shift map in the number base p. For example, p = 10 is a decimal shift map.

Prince Albert Liberal MP Charles McDonald was persuaded to step aside in order to create a vacancy for King. The Prince Albert by-election would normally have been a formality and the Conservative Party declined to enter a candidate as did the Progressives. However, an acclamation was avoided when Burgess entered the contest with the encouragement of the previous Tory candidate John Diefenbaker. Burgess ran as an independent candidate and argued that Mackenzie King was appropriating the riding of Prince Albert and assuming the compliance of its residents. In an election address, he said: Burgess was defeated in the February 15, 1926, by- election by a three-to-one margin. Four years later, after the 1930 federal election defeated Mackenzie King's government and brought the Conservatives to power, Burgess moved to Ottawa to take up a position as private secretary to the new Minister of Agriculture, Robert Weir.

The town centre is right on the sea, and the municipal district includes a series of charming country villages, such as Itziar, Lastur and Elorriaga. The natural setting is a perfect combination of blue sea and green mountains. Traditionally, the attraction of Deba is based on the beauty of the landscape, its rich heritage, centuries-old culture and exquisite gastronomy. Today, it is reinforced with modern facilities, and entertainment and leisure facilities that meet all visitors' needs. Deba is a town of summer residents, but it is also on the St James's Way. History Thousands of years before Deba was founded, the town's relationship with sea and water already formed an indelible part of its history. The shell deposits and bone harpoons found in many caves in the Deba municipal districts and some of the figures in the Palaeolithic shrine at Ekain are testimonies of that relationship. Curiously, thousands of year later, Roman chronicles also cite the coast and the Deba, a river that would later lend its name to the town. The town's origins date back to 1343. History tells that Sancho IV of Castile granted the citizens of \\"Monte-Real\\", in Itziar, a charter as a township in 1294. Subsequently, they moved closer to the coast and founded a new settlement that they called Monreal de Deba. In the 15th century, Deba enjoyed a period of splendour due to shipping, particularly with the export of wool from Castile and Arag√≥n to various European countries. In the 19th century the port declined and a new activity began: tourism. Deba's relationship with the sea changed when the town became one of the pioneers of tourism in Europe. Currently, Deba still faces the sea with a taste of salt in the air. The town offers visitors the opportunity to enjoy a unique coast and a modern spa, thus combining fun with therapy.

Within theater, it is often referred to as a fringe festival, following the unjuried Edinburgh Festival Fringe.  History  Traditionally gatherings have had varying degrees of inclusiveness and exclusiveness, hence broadly speaking, the notion of a \\"juried\\" or \\"unjuried\\" gathering dates to prehistory. More narrowly, the notion of an unjuried exhibition arose in response to the Paris Salon, which began in 1725 and was juried from 1748 onwards. The Salon was very influential in the western world during the period 1748‚Äì1890 as an arbiter of taste, and the revolt against its strictures was a key conflict in the development of western art. An exhibitions of works refused from the official Salon was referred to as a Salon des Refus√©s, which became particularly prominent from 1863 onwards, when the French government under Emperor Napol√©on III funded a Salon des Refus√©s for the large number of rejected artworks in that year. 1884 saw the formation of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants (Society of Independent Artists), whose device was Sans jury ni r√©compense (Without jury nor awards), and which has run unjuried art exhibits from 1884 to the present day, under the title of Salon des Ind√©pendants (Independents Salon). The development of these rejected or unjuried exhibits was key in the development of the avant-garde in painting, particularly the Ecole de Paris (Paris School), with the SAI being particularly prominent during the Gilded Age, until World War I. In theater, unjuried festivals rose to prominence in the second half of the twentieth century, most prominently in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.  Criteria  Despite declaring no criteria for inclusion, some unjuried exhibits or festivals have constraints on genre.

That is, when several buffers are present together in the same solution, they are all exposed to the same hydrogen ion activity. Hence, the pK of each buffer will dictate the ratio of the concentrations of its base and weak acid forms at the given pH, in accordance with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Any condition that changes the balance of one of the buffer systems, also changes the balance of all the others because the buffer systems actually buffer one another by shifting hydrogen ions back and forth from one to the other. The isohydric principle has special relevance to in vivo biochemistry where multiple acid/ base pairs are in solution. The simplifying isohydric principle gives two important concepts. First, all of the buffers in a multiple-buffered system contribute to pH of the system. Secondly, the pH (at equilibrium) can be calculated from an individual buffer system regardless of other buffers present. That is, in vivo, knowing the PCO2 (weak acid) and the bicarbonate (conjugate base) and the pKa of that buffer system, the pH can be calculated regardless of the presence of other contributing buffers. The clinical relevance is that arterial blood gas often directly measures the CO2 levels and the pH, but the bicarbonate levels are then calculated from that information‚Äîwithout regard to other buffers present References Category:Biochemistry Category:Equilibrium chemistry ","title":"Isohydric principle"},{"id":"23868618","text":"William Godwin by Henry William Pickersgill \\"To Godwin\\" or \\"To William Godwin\\" was written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and published in the 10 January 1795 Morning Chronicle as part of the Sonnets on Eminent Characters series. William Godwin was admired by Coleridge for his political beliefs. However, Coleridge did not support Godwin's atheistic views, which caused tension between the two. Although the poem praises Godwin, it invokes an argument that the two shared over theological matters. After the poem was written, the relationship between Coleridge and Godwin cooled and the poem was not reprinted. Background Coleridge's \\"To William Godwin, Author of Political Justice\\" became the ninth sonnet in the series Sonnets on Eminent Characters in the 10 January 1795 Morning Chronicle. Coleridge sent 6 lines of the poem to Robert Southey in a letter that read:Mays 2001 p. 165 \\"I have written one to Godwin‚Äîbut the mediocrity of the eight first Lines is most miserably magazinish! I have plucked therefore these scentless Road flowers from the Chaptlet‚Äîand intreat thee, thou River God of Pieria, to weave into it the gorgeous Water Lily from thy stream, or the fair smelling Violets on thy Bank\\".Mays 2001 qtd. p. 165 Coleridge was dissatisfied with the poem's quality and content, and the poem was not republished in one of Coleridge's collections of poems after it appeared in the Morning Chronicle. In particular, his views of Godwin turned from the worse following the printing.Mays 2001 p. 166 By 1796, Coleridge's changed views on Godwin began to be shared by others, including his friend Charles Lamb. However, Lamb was to later befriend Godwin in 1798. By 1800, Coleridge, Lamb, and others were still associating with Godwin, and Coleridge joined others in helping Godwin produce a play at the end of the year.Woodcock 1989 pp. 173‚Äì174 Poem The poem reads: Southey's original sketch for eight lines of the poem, on Coleridge's request, read: Themes The Sonnets on Eminent Characters contained many poems dedicated to those Coleridge considered his hero from many fields.Ashton 1997 p. 61 Of the poems, \\"To Godwin\\" is similar to the poems \\"To Bowles\\" and \\"To Robert Southey\\" in that they talk about Coleridge's personal life and Godwin's influence over it. However, Coleridge's view of Godwin changed over time and he grew dissatisfied with the poem as a result. Coleridge respected Godwin for Godwin's support of those put on trial during the 1794 Treason Trials, and Coleridge owed much of his political beliefs to Godwin. However, Coleridge and Godwin differed on their views of religion, which became a source of dispute between the two.Ashton 1997 p. 60 Following the reading of Coleridge's previous poem in the series \\"To Kosciusko\\" by Thomas Holcroft, Holcroft invited Coleridge to dinner with Godwin, Richard Porson, and himself. The conversation turned to religion, and Coleridge believed that Porson was a strong speaker while Godwin lacked intelligence in his speech.Marshall 1984 p. 125 Godwin, unlike Coleridge, was an atheist, which caused Coleridge concern. On Coleridge's admission, he was able to win the debate with Holcroft but was unable to convince Godwin about theism until 5 years later. Within \\"To Godwin\\", Coleridge addresses Godwin with religious terms in a manner to provoke while simultaneously praising Godwin. In particular, lines 9 and 10 continue this previous dispute with Godwin but in poetic form.Ashton 1997 pp. 60‚Äì61 Coleridge's support of Godwin's politics appeared in his A Moral and Political Lecture given in Bristol during 1795. However, in Coleridge's Political Lecture of the same year, he criticized Godwin's political beliefs that Coleridge suggests separated Godwin from the masses. Further works during 1795 continued to discuss the positives and negatives of Godwin, with Conciones ad Populum attacking philosophy that is not dedicated to mankind, in reference to Godwin, and Lectures on Revealed Religion, its Corruption, and Politica Views in which he argued in support of Godwin's promotion of the removal of private property, the idea that government is problematic, and that revolution shouldn't be violent, but Coleridge continued to Christianize Godwin's philosophy. By 1796, Coleridge completely turned against Godwin's beliefs.Marshall 1984 p. 125‚Äì126 At the time, Coleridge planned to write a small essay against Godwin, and he criticized Godwin's atheism in a 17 December 1796 letter to John Thelwall, one of the defendants in the 1794 Treason Trials.Holmes 1989 p. 130 Notes References * Ashton, Rosemary.

Life and work She was born in Rangoon (currently Yangon), Burma into a Scottish timber and rice-trading family. Her early years were in the hands of a German nanny, and the initial intention was that she should be sent to Berlin to complete her education. The deteriorating political climate between Britain and Germany led to her moving to Britain instead at the age of six. She attended Bedales School from 1918 to 1924. She claimedConversations with her husband's nephew, Tom Brown,1986‚Äì99 in later years that she never would have been able to write crime novels if she had not learned German as a child from her nanny, the rigorous sentence structure and complex rules of grammar being an indispensable preparation for the architecture of a crime thriller. Unable to study English Literature, because she was never taught Latin or Greek, she took a diploma in journalism at London University (1925‚Äì1928), and wrote two novels under her own name in the early 1930s. It was at this time that she met and married her first husband. Around 1940, she met a lecturer in Botany at Bedford College, Dr (later Professor) Robert Brown, and the same year her first crime novel, Give a Corpse a Bad Name, was published. She separated from her first husband and lived with Robert Brown in Belsize Park, London, from 1942. However, she did not obtain a divorce and marry Brown until October 1945. She remained on friendly terms with her first husband, who also remarried. In 1951 she and her new husband moved to Cornell University in the USA, where her husband had been offered a post. Notwithstanding the financial attraction of such a posting in austerity postwar Britain, they returned a year later owing to the atmosphere of McCarthyism. Having seen the rise of fascism in Europe, they were disturbed by the \\"witch-hunts\\" against many writers and academics accused of communist sympathies. In 1953, she became one of the founding members of the Crime Writers' Association (she was its chair in 1977). She was inducted into the famed Detection Club in 1958. From 1957, when her husband was appointed Regius Professor of Botany at the University of Edinburgh, until shortly after his retirement in 1977, they lived in Edinburgh. Citing the long, cold winters as a reason, they then moved south to the village of Blewbury in Oxfordshire, where they lived until her sudden death in 1995. She professed no religious faith and was probably instrumental in turning her husband from distinct evangelism in the 1930s towards agnosticism. She was buried in Blewbury in a non-religious ceremony. Her final novel, A Thief in the Night, was published posthumously in 1995. She was survived by a nephew, Peter MacTaggart. In the United States, her novels were published under the name E.X. Ferrars, her US publishers assuring her that \\"the 'X' would 'do it'\\". Ferrars was in fact her mother's maiden name. Though the majority of Ferrars's works are standalone novels, she wrote several series. Her first five novels all feature Toby Dyke, a freelance journalist, and his companion, George, who uses several surnames and is implied to be a former criminal. Late in her career, she began writing about a semi-estranged married couple, Virginia and Felix Freer, and a retired botanist, Andrew Basnett. Several of her short stories also feature an elderly detective called Jonas P. Jonas. Her extraordinary output owes a great deal to considerable self-discipline and diligent method. Her plots were worked out in detail in hand-written notebooks before being filled out in typed manuscript; she said that they were worked backwards from the denouement. Like every writer, she based characters and situations on people she knew and things she had seen in real life. She travelled with her husband when his academic career required, for example to Adelaide where he was a visiting professor at the University of South Australia, and on holidays specially to Madeira, which they loved. Her books are written so that readers are spared from violence or extreme unpleasantness. Due to their backgrounds, her characters do not expect crime or violence to impinge on their lives. They are educated, and often work in academic or artistic fields. Female characters are independent and \\"politely feminist.\\" Bibliography Novels written as Morna MacTaggart *Turn Single (1932) *Broken Music (1934) Toby Dyke series *Give a Corpse a Bad Name (1940) *Remove the Bodies (1941) (published in the US as Rehearsals for Murder) *Death in Botanist's Bay (1941) (published in the US as Murder of a Suicide) *Don't Monkey with Murder (1942) (published in the US as The Shape of a Stain) *Your Neck in a Noose (1942) (published in the US as Neck in a Noose) Virginia and Felix Freer series *Last Will and Testament (1978) *Frog in the Throat (1980) *Thinner Than Water (1981) *Death of a Minor Character (1983) *I Met Murder (1985) *Woman Slaughter (1989) *Sleep of the Unjust (1990) *Beware of the Dog (1992) Andrew Basnett series *Something Wicked (1983) *The Root of All Evil (1984) *The Crime and the Crystal (1985) *The Other Devil's Name (1986) *A Murder Too Many (1988) *Smoke Without Fire (1990) *A Hobby of Murder (1994) *A Choice of Evils (1995) Other novels *I, Said The Fly (1945) *Murder among Friends (1946) (published in the US as Cheat the Hangman) *With Murder in Mind (1948) *The March Hare Murders (1949) *Milk of Human Kindness (1950) *Hunt the Tortoise (1950) *The Clock that Wouldn't Stop (1952) *Alibi for a Witch (1952) *Murder in Time (1953) *The Lying Voices (1954) *Enough to Kill a Horse (1955) *Always Say Die (1956) (published in the US as We Haven't Seen Her Lately; see Media Adaptations) *Murder Moves In (1956) (published in the US as Kill or Cure) *Furnished for Murder (1957) *Unreasonable Doubt (1958) (published in the US as Count the Cost) *A Tale of Two Murders (1959) (published in the US as Depart This Life) *Fear the Light (1960) *Sleeping Dogs (1960) *The Wandering Widows (1962) *The Busy Body (1962) (published in the US as Seeing Double) *The Doubly Dead (1963) *A Legal Fiction (1964) (published in the US as The Decayed Gentlewoman) *Ninth Life (1965) *No Peace for the Wicked (1965) *Zero at the Bone (1967) *The Swaying Pillars (1968) *Skeleton Staff (1969) *The Seven Sleepers (1970) *A Stranger and Afraid (1971) *Breath of Suspicion (1972) *The Small World of Murder (1973) *Foot in the Grave (1973) *Hanged Man's House (1974) *Alive and Dead (1974) *Drowned Rat (1975) *The Cup and the Lip (1975) *Blood Flies Upwards (1976) *Pretty Pink Shroud (1977) *Murders Anonymous (1977) *In at the Kill (1978) *Witness Before the Fact (1979) *Experiment with Death (1981) *Skeleton in Search of a Cupboard (1982) (published in the US as Skeleton in Search of a Closet) *Come and Be Killed (1987) *Trial by Fury (1989) *Danger from the Dead (1991) *Answer Came There None (1992) *Thy Brother Death (1993) *Seeing Is Believing (1994) *A Thief in the Night (1995) Short story compilations *Designs on Life (1980) *Sequence of Events (1989) *The Casebook of Jonas P.

Although there have been numerous cases of people being attacked with needles and syringes, the idea that people infected with AIDS have deliberately attempted to infect others in this manner is generally considered an urban legend. Origins Although fanciful tales of so-called \\"needle men\\" or white slavers, who supposedly injected unsuspecting young girls with morphine before carrying them away into a life of prostitution, had been around since the 1930s, the legend probably has its roots in a 1989 incident where ten teenage girls were arrested and later charged with stabbing numerous women with pins in the Upper West Side area of New York City. Coming near the height of the 1980s HIV scares, this led to a great deal of panic amongst the local community although health officials were keen to stress that the chances of anybody contracting the virus in this way were practically zero, and nobody affected in the attacks subsequently tested positive for HIV. As an email/Internet scare story The rise of the Internet in the 1990s led to the rise of numerous urban legends concerning the pin prick attack, which could be quickly spread via email and discussion forums and which soon assumed a standardised form. The email would take the form of a warning to others that a young person had been visiting a cinema or a night club when the person felt a slight prick on his or her arm. Not taking any notice, the person would carry on with his or her leisure activity, and it was only later that the person would find stuck to his or her clothes or in his or her pocket a badge or sticker carrying the slogan \\"welcome to the AIDS club\\", followed a few months later with a positive HIV test. These rumours bear similarities to the so- called AIDS Mary legends of the 1980s, whereby a man would enjoy a one-night stand with a stranger at his house and awaken the next morning to find the stranger gone and the words \\"Welcome to the AIDS Club\\" written in red lipstick on his bathroom mirror. However, the American Center for Disease Control has stressed on numerous occasions that it has yet to confirm a single case of HIV as being transmitted in this fashion and has dismissed such emails as a hoax. The motive behind such emails appears to be little more than a scare story intended to frighten the recipient into staying away from leisure establishments by playing on the public fear of AIDS and the notion that an individual could be infected with a killer disease through no fault of one's own. Documented Examples A pin prick attack leading to the deliberate transmission of HIV occurred at the Long Bay Jail in Sydney on July 22, 1990, when prison officer Geoffrey Pearce was attacked by HIV-infected prisoner Graham Farlow, who stabbed him with a syringe full of his own infected blood. Despite immediate medical attention and the \\"one in 200\\" chance of being infected, Pearce tested positive for the disease a few months later, and died of an AIDS related illness in 1997 at age 28. In 1992, Brryan Jackson was injected with a syringe of HIV-infected blood by his father. Jackson was diagnosed with AIDS that same year. In 1998, Richard J. Schmidt, a physician in Lafayette, Louisiana, was convicted of attempted murder after injecting a former lover, Janice Trahan, with AIDS and Hepatitis C-tainted blood, claiming to be giving her a vitamin shot. Trahan developed both Hep-C and HIV as a result.

They distribute international prepaid calling cards within Japan and Asia via convenience stores. Brastel's largest demographic are Brazilian expats living in Japan. Brastel is one of the most commonly used calling services in Japan. The company was started in 1996, originally selling call back services. In 2000 they released the first rechargeable calling card in Japan. This product shortly becomes Brastel's biggest source of income. Recently they have started to invest in IP phone technology through their FLiP and Basix services. They are also noted for their philanthropic work in Brazilian communities as well as for their involvement in the building of schools, providing seminars and lectures for the poor and disadvantaged communities around the world. The promotion of Brazilian culture in Japan has played a prominent part of Brastel since the creation of sub company Tupiniquim Entertainment in 2005. Tupiniquim Entertainment primarily concentrates on the promotion of Brazilian movies, music, actresses/actors and culture in Japan.  History  = Early history (1996-2000) = Brastel Telecom was formed in 1996 by Junji Tanabe and Kendi Kawai, which originally provided callback system services mainly to the Brazilian community in Japan. In 1998, an agreement with KDDI (formally KDD) allowed the company to acquire international connections from Japan. In 2000 Brastel released a rechargeable prepaid calling card called Brastel Card (formally Brastel Smartphone Card) and it was available for free in convenience stores and ethnic shops, restaurants and bars throughout Japan. Shortly after they introduced a paperless recharge system, Smart Pit, developed by NTT Comware. The Smart Pit system utilises a barcode printed on the back of the card allowing payments without coupons. = Expansion (2002-2005) = In 2002 Brastel entered into agreements to use the Japanese PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), which is controlled by the major carriers in Japan. This allowed the company to acquire connections within Japanese territory, making it possible for them to start offering their own direct prefix numbers. Shortly after, Brastel entered the American market, promoting its services in California, USA, targeting the Latino and Japanese communities. = The Internet Age (2006-2016) = In 2006 broadband internet became the standard for home-based internet connections. Increased bandwidth allowed free calling services such as Skype, Google Talk and iChat to emerge. To deal with this new form of communication Brastel diverged into new areas; investing in online Live Support (Japan only launched in October), providing customers real-time assistance over the internet in both English and Japanese. During the same year they opened an office in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Image:FlipWikiLogo.gifFlip Logo Image:Flipphone.jpegFlip phone Image:Basixwikilogo.pngBasix logo In January 2007, Brastel launches the FLIP service, an IP phone that allows customers to call domestic and international phones via the internet. Three months later, they launch Basix, an IP phone service designed for medium and small sized companies based on the ASP system. While FLiP is aimed at the home user, Basix is aimed at companies looking to replace or buy a PBX system.  Culture  In 2005 Brastel add a new cultural division, Tupiniquim Entertainment which primarily focuses on Brazilian culture. Tupiniquim Entertainment's main event is the Festival Cinema Brasil, a yearly event that showcases films from Brazil. This cultural division has also invited several musicians from Brazil to perform in Japan, as well as released CDs and DVDs of such artists in Japanese stores.  Corporate culture  Brastel has a unique working culture considering it is a Japanese company, within the work environment employees are not required to wear a suit or tie, there are at least 3 main languages spoken: Portuguese, Japanese and English with many more spoken by the 15 or more different nationalities working there. Due to the large Brazilian work force many aspects of the company are tailored for Brazilians including a Brazilian lorry arriving twice a week with Brazilian food and goods. Also the employees can order a Brazilian bento every day which is delivered direct to the company. In previous years the company has held an international food festival, everyone is encouraged to cook food from their home country and bring it into work to share. Brastel has also contributed to various charities such as building a school for children in Cambodia, donating money to the countries affected by the tsunami of 2004 and the SARS virus.  Brastel Card  The Brastel Card is the main product from Brastel, released in 2000 the card has gone through many iterations with the latest one released in November 2009 under the name of Brastel Card. Like prior cards it can be used to make national and international calls and be recharged via credit card, convenience stores or vouchers. In addition to the standard calling services Brastel also offer International Access to call from other countries, Credit Transfer, International Call Forwarding, International Recharge of mobile phones, IP Access and SMS text messages. Alongside the standard calling features present in the Brastel Card, the card can now be linked to the FLiP service offered by Brastel. FLiP is the VoIP phone service sold by Brastel, the Brastel Card can be used for cheap international calls and for payment of monthly subscription fees and calling fees. In recent the FLIP and BASIX phones have become more a relevant in the survival of Brastel as a company, with the popularity of Skype, Brastel has had to face competition from free software with free calls. Their answer has been FLIP, a VoIP service with a monthly fee starting from ¬•500 per month. With the current financial climate time will only tell if FLIP will turn out to be a success in the face of Skype and other free VoIP services.

James Oliphant, was chairman of the Honourable East India Company, and a third brother was the artist and composer Thomas Oliphant, who wrote the words of \\"Deck the Hall(s) with Boughs of Holly\\", \\"Men of Harlech\\", \\"The Ash Grove\\" and accomplished many other works, including cataloguing the manuscript music at the British Museum and writing the chorale for the wedding of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. It is unknown whether Oliphant, like his younger brother Thomas, went to the nearby Winchester College. He was admitted to the bar in Edinburgh and then moved to London, where he was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn. Personal life Oliphant married Catherine Maria Campbell, the daughter of a Colonel Ronald Campbell and Charlotte Johanna Cloete. Their son, Laurence Oliphant, went on to become a well-known author, international traveller, lawyer, and a Member of the House of Commons as his uncle had before him. Career After qualifying as a barrister, Oliphant set up practice as an equity (legal) draughtsman. In 1827, Oliphant was offered the post of attorney general in the Cape Colony. William Menzies had been offered the post first but had turned it down. This was the year when the judicial system in Cape Colony was being reformed. Oliphant was also appointed King's Advocate in the Vice-Admiralty Court. His salary for the two positions amounted to ¬£1,500 per annum. Oliphant sailed to the colony in August 1827 aboard the Sestoris and arrived in mid- October. Oliphant's duties as attorney general included both prosecutions on behalf of the Crown and also acting in an advisory capacity to the Government. Oliphant was appointed Chief Justice of Ceylon in October 1838, succeeding Sir William Norris. He was knighted by letters patent in 1839. Sir Anthony lived in Colombo, purchasing a property called 'Alcove,' in Captains Gardens, subsequently known as Maha Nuge Gardens in Colpetty. When the Oliphant family left Ceylon he sold it to Sir Harry Dias. Interests Sir Anthony Oliphant's tea estate, the Oliphant Estate, situated in the hill country in Nuwara Eliya, was one of the first estates to grow tea in Ceylon, when thirty plants were smuggled from China.

In 1842, his parents Samuel and Maria moved to Michigan, settling on a farm two-and-a-half miles west of Plymouth known as Cooper's Corners. Henry was the eldest of ten children; brothers Chauncey Elbridge, Oscar Nathaniel and Samuel Valentine, with sisters, Carolina Adelia Bennett, Janette \\"Nettie\\" Vrooman, Marietta \\"Mate\\" Hough, Frank Libby Adams, Anna Maria and Jennie L. Chadwick. H.W. Baker studied photography, and during the Civil War worked as a photographer in Ypsilanti, Michigan with his cousin, Edwin P. Baker. In 1866 he returned to Plymouth and entered into business. Mr. Baker was the Justice of the Peace for the Village of Plymouth in 1876. In 1882, he partnered with Mike Conner, Oscar A. Fraser, Calvin B. Crosby, Roswell Lincoln Root, S.J. Springer, David D. Allen, the Hon. Orlando R. Pattengell, brother-in-law, Lewis Cass Hough, J.P. Woodard, Theodore C.

Manufacturing windmills was more or less successful, but in 1888 the company introduced the metal Daisy Air Rifle, which was also a Clarence Hamilton design, and moved prosperously away from the production of windmills. In 1895, the company changed its name to the Daisy Manufacturing Company, and built an immense business in the manufacture of air rifles. Henry W.

In 1904, Mr. Baker, joined by his sister Caroline Bennett, along with his business partners within the Daisy firm took the initial stock offering of the Ford Motor Company of Canada. Baker was married twice: first to Flora Bromsfield, then to Angeline C. Myers. His house was contemporaneously described as \\"a beautiful home; a costly brick structure.\\" H.W. Baker died at his home, Monday November 24, 1919. Description The Henry W. Baker House is a two-story structure constructed from brick. The house is of a fanciful Italianate design, likely based on an illustration in a pattern book. The house was a landmark in Plymouth because of the unusual tower, shaped like a pagoda, atop the mansard roof. The house is asymmetrical in plan, with a cut stone foundation and a kitchen wing in the rear, extended by later additions of a carriage shed and cement block garage. The main section of the house is articulated with bay windows and porches, and gables on the upper story, most noticeable on the front facade. The entrance has arch-top double doors under a small porch; over that is a window with a gabled pediment. The Henry W. Baker House history Henry W. Baker built his house in 1875, and lived there until his death in 1919.Baker, Henry W., House from the state of Michigan, retrieved 8/4/09 His sister Anna lived in the home until 1943, at which time the pagoda tower was removed from the house during a renovation. The structure was converted to commercial use in the 1970s and neglected. The building was later restored, including the pagoda, and now houses a law practice. A state of Michigan historic marker is placed in front of the house, which incorrectly states that he died in the year 1920.

The Reynolds number can be used to predict where this transition will take place. A vortex street around a cylinder. This can occur around cylinders and spheres, for any fluid, cylinder size and fluid speed, provided that it has a Reynolds number between roughly 40 and 1000. George Stokes introduced Reynolds numbers. Osborne Reynolds popularised the concept. The Reynolds number' (') helps predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. At low Reynolds numbers, flows tend to be dominated by laminar (sheet-like) flow, while at high Reynolds numbers flows tend to be turbulent. The turbulence results from differences in the fluid's speed and direction, which may sometimes intersect or even move counter to the overall direction of the flow (eddy currents). These eddy currents begin to churn the flow, using up energy in the process, which for liquids increases the chances of cavitation. Reynolds numbers are an important dimensionless quantity in fluid mechanics. The Reynolds number has wide applications, ranging from liquid flow in a pipe to the passage of air over an aircraft wing. It is used to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and is used in the scaling of similar but different-sized flow situations, such as between an aircraft model in a wind tunnel and the full size version. The predictions of the onset of turbulence and the ability to calculate scaling effects can be used to help predict fluid behaviour on a larger scale, such as in local or global air or water movement and thereby the associated meteorological and climatological effects. The concept was introduced by George Stokes in 1851, but the Reynolds number was named by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1908 after Osborne Reynolds (1842‚Äì1912), who popularized its use in 1883. Definition The Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities. A region where these forces change behavior is known as a boundary layer, such as the bounding surface in the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of high-velocity fluid into a low-velocity fluid, such as the hot gases emitted from a flame in air. This relative movement generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which tends to inhibit turbulence. The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation. This ability to predict the onset of turbulent flow is an important design tool for equipment such as piping systems or aircraft wings, but the Reynolds number is also used in scaling of fluid dynamics problems, and is used to determine dynamic similitude between two different cases of fluid flow, such as between a model aircraft, and its full-size version. Such scaling is not linear and the application of Reynolds numbers to both situations allows scaling factors to be developed. With respect to laminar and turbulent flow regimes: * laminar flow occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces are dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion; * turbulent flow occurs at high Reynolds numbers and is dominated by inertial forces, which tend to produce chaotic eddies, vortices and other flow instabilities. The Reynolds number is defined as :\\\\mathrm{Re} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho u L}{\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{u L}{ u} where: * is the density of the fluid (SI units: kg/m3) * is the flow speed (m/s) * is a characteristic linear dimension (m) (see the below sections of this article for examples) * is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa¬∑s or N¬∑s/m2 or kg/(m¬∑s)) * is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m2/s). The Brezina equation The Reynolds number can be defined for several different situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface.The definition of the Reynolds number is not to be confused with the Reynolds equation or lubrication equation. These definitions generally include the fluid properties of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a characteristic length or characteristic dimension (L in the above equation). This dimension is a matter of convention ‚Äì for example radius and diameter are equally valid to describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe, or for a sphere moving in a fluid, the internal diameter is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects have an equivalent diameter defined. For fluids of variable density such as compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as non-Newtonian fluids, special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in some circumstances, notably stirred vessels. In practice, matching the Reynolds number is not on its own sufficient to guarantee similitude. Fluid flow is generally chaotic, and very small changes to shape and surface roughness of bounding surfaces can result in very different flows. Nevertheless, Reynolds numbers are a very important guide and are widely used. History Osborne Reynolds's apparatus of 1883 demonstrating the onset of turbulent flow. The apparatus is still at the University of Manchester. Diagram from Reynolds's 1883 paper showing onset of turbulent flow. Osborne Reynolds famously studied the conditions in which the flow of fluid in pipes transitioned from laminar flow to turbulent flow. In his 1883 paper Reynolds described the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a classic experiment in which he examined the behaviour of water flow under different flow velocities using a small stream of dyed water introduced into the centre of clear water flow in a larger pipe. The larger pipe was glass so the behaviour of the layer of the dyed stream could be observed, and at the end of this pipe there was a flow control valve used to vary the water velocity inside the tube. When the velocity was low, the dyed layer remained distinct through the entire length of the large tube. When the velocity was increased, the layer broke up at a given point and diffused throughout the fluid's cross-section. The point at which this happened was the transition point from laminar to turbulent flow. From these experiments came the dimensionless Reynolds number for dynamic similarity‚Äîthe ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. Reynolds also proposed what is now known as the Reynolds-averaging of turbulent flows, where quantities such as velocity are expressed as the sum of mean and fluctuating components. Such averaging allows for 'bulk' description of turbulent flow, for example using the Reynolds- averaged Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. Flow in a pipe For flow in a pipe or tube, the Reynolds number is generally defined as : \\\\mathrm{Re} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho u D_\\\\text{H}}{\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{u D_\\\\text{H}}{ u} = \\\\frac{Q D_\\\\text{H}}{ u A} = \\\\frac{W D_\\\\text{H}}{\\\\mu A}, where : is the hydraulic diameter of the pipe (the inside diameter if the pipe is circular) (m), : is the volumetric flow rate (m3/s), : is the pipe's cross-sectional area (m2), : is the mean velocity of the fluid (m/s), : (mu) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa¬∑s = N¬∑s/m2 = kg/(m¬∑s)), : (nu) is the kinematic viscosity () (m2/s), : (rho) is the density of the fluid (kg/m3), : is the mass flowrate of the fluid (kg/s). For shapes such as squares, rectangular or annular ducts where the height and width are comparable, the characteristic dimension for internal-flow situations is taken to be the hydraulic diameter, , defined as :D_\\\\text{H} = \\\\frac{4 A}{P}, where is the cross-sectional area, and is the wetted perimeter. The wetted perimeter for a channel is the total perimeter of all channel walls that are in contact with the flow. This means that the length of the channel exposed to air is not included in the wetted perimeter. For a circular pipe, the hydraulic diameter is exactly equal to the inside pipe diameter: :D_\\\\text{H} = D. For an annular duct, such as the outer channel in a tube-in- tube heat exchanger, the hydraulic diameter can be shown algebraically to reduce to :D_\\\\text{H,annulus} = D_\\\\text{o} - D_\\\\text{i}, where : is the inside diameter of the outer pipe, : is the outside diameter of the inner pipe. For calculation involving flow in non-circular ducts, the hydraulic diameter can be substituted for the diameter of a circular duct, with reasonable accuracy, if the aspect ratio AR of the duct cross-section remains in the range < AR < 4\\\\. Laminar‚Äìturbulent transition In boundary layer flow over a flat plate, experiments confirm that, after a certain length of flow, a laminar boundary layer will become unstable and turbulent. This instability occurs across different scales and with different fluids, usually when ‚âà , where is the distance from the leading edge of the flat plate, and the flow velocity is the freestream velocity of the fluid outside the boundary layer. For flow in a pipe of diameter , experimental observations show that for \\"fully developed\\" flow,Full development of the flow occurs as the flow enters the pipe, the boundary layer thickens and then stabilizes after several diameters distance into the pipe. laminar flow occurs when < 2300 and turbulent flow occurs when > 2900. At the lower end of this range, a continuous turbulent-flow will form, but only at a very long distance from the inlet of the pipe. The flow in between will begin to transition from laminar to turbulent and then back to laminar at irregular intervals, called intermittent flow. This is due to the different speeds and conditions of the fluid in different areas of the pipe's cross-section, depending on other factors such as pipe roughness and flow uniformity. Laminar flow tends to dominate in the fast-moving center of the pipe while slower-moving turbulent flow dominates near the wall. As the Reynolds number increases, the continuous turbulent-flow moves closer to the inlet and the intermittency in between increases, until the flow becomes fully turbulent at > 2900. This result is generalized to non-circular channels using the hydraulic diameter, allowing a transition Reynolds number to be calculated for other shapes of channel. These transition Reynolds numbers are also called critical Reynolds numbers, and were studied by Osborne Reynolds around 1895. The critical Reynolds number is different for every geometry. Flow in a wide duct For a fluid moving between two plane parallel surfaces‚Äîwhere the width is much greater than the space between the plates‚Äîthen the characteristic dimension is equal to twice the distance between the plates. This is consistent with the annular duct and rectangular duct cases above taken to a limiting aspect ratio. Flow in an open channel For flow of liquid with a free surface, the hydraulic radius must be determined. This is the cross- sectional area of the channel divided by the wetted perimeter. For a semi- circular channel, it is quarter the diameter (in case of full pipe flow). For a rectangular channel, the hydraulic radius is the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter. Some texts then use a characteristic dimension that is four times the hydraulic radius, chosen because it gives the same value of Re for the onset of turbulence as in pipe flow, while others use the hydraulic radius as the characteristic length-scale with consequently different values of for transition and turbulent flow. Flow around airfoils Reynolds numbers are used in airfoil design to (among other things) manage \\"scale effect\\" when computing/comparing characteristics (a tiny wing, scaled to be huge, will perform differently). Fluid dynamicists define the chord Reynolds number like this: , where is the flight speed, is the chord length, and is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid in which the airfoil operates, which is for the atmosphere at sea level. In some special studies a characteristic length other than chord may be used; rare is the \\"span Reynolds number\\", which is not to be confused with spanwise stations on a wing, where chord is still used. Object in a fluid The Reynolds number for an object moving in a fluid, called the particle Reynolds number and often denoted , characterizes the nature of the surrounding flow and its fall velocity. =In viscous fluids= The high viscosity of honey results in perfectly laminar flow when poured from a bucket, while the low surface tension allows it to remain sheet-like even after reaching the fluid below. Analogous to turbulence, when the flow meets resistance it slows and begins oscillating back and forth, piling upon itself. streamlines, drag force and force by gravity . Where the viscosity is naturally high, such as polymer solutions and polymer melts, flow is normally laminar. The Reynolds number is very small and Stokes' law can be used to measure the viscosity of the fluid. Spheres are allowed to fall through the fluid and they reach the terminal velocity quickly, from which the viscosity can be determined. The laminar flow of polymer solutions is exploited by animals such as fish and dolphins, who exude viscous solutions from their skin to aid flow over their bodies while swimming. It has been used in yacht racing by owners who want to gain a speed advantage by pumping a polymer solution such as low molecular weight polyoxyethylene in water, over the wetted surface of the hull. It is, however, a problem for mixing of polymers, because turbulence is needed to distribute fine filler (for example) through the material. Inventions such as the \\"cavity transfer mixer\\" have been developed to produce multiple folds into a moving melt so as to improve mixing efficiency. The device can be fitted onto extruders to aid mixing. =Sphere in a fluid= For a sphere in a fluid, the characteristic length-scale is the diameter of the sphere and the characteristic velocity is that of the sphere relative to the fluid some distance away from the sphere, such that the motion of the sphere does not disturb that reference parcel of fluid. The density and viscosity are those belonging to the fluid. Note that purely laminar flow only exists up to = 10 under this definition. Under the condition of low , the relationship between force and speed of motion is given by Stokes' law. =Rectangular object in a fluid= The equation for a rectangular object is identical to that of a sphere, with the object being approximated as an ellipsoid and the axis of length being chosen as the characteristic length scale. Such considerations are important in natural streams, for example, where there are few perfectly spherical grains. For grains in which measurement of each axis is impractical, sieve diameters are used instead as the characteristic particle length-scale. Both approximations alter the values of the critical Reynolds number. =Fall velocity= The particle Reynolds number is important in determining the fall velocity of a particle. When the particle Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, Stokes' law can be used to calculate its fall velocity. When the particle Reynolds number indicates turbulent flow, a turbulent drag law must be constructed to model the appropriate settling velocity. =Packed bed= For fluid flow through a bed, of approximately spherical particles of diameter in contact, if the voidage is and the superficial velocity is , the Reynolds number can be defined as : \\\\mathrm{Re} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho v_\\\\text{s} D}{\\\\mu}, or : \\\\mathrm{Re} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho v_\\\\text{s} D}{\\\\mu \\\\varepsilon}, or : \\\\mathrm{Re} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho v_\\\\text{s} D}{\\\\mu (1 - \\\\varepsilon)}. The choice of equation depends on the system involved: the first is successful in correlating the data for various types of packed and fluidized beds, the second Reynolds number suits for the liquid-phase data, while the third was found successful in correlating the fluidized bed data, being first introduced for liquid fluidized bed system. Laminar conditions apply up to = 10, fully turbulent from = 2000. =Stirred vessel= In a cylindrical vessel stirred by a central rotating paddle, turbine or propeller, the characteristic dimension is the diameter of the agitator . The velocity is where is the rotational speed in rad per second. Then the Reynolds number is: :\\\\mathrm{Re} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho N D^2} {\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho V D} {\\\\mu}. The system is fully turbulent for values of above . Pipe friction The Moody diagram, which describes the Darcy‚ÄìWeisbach friction factor as a function of the Reynolds number and relative pipe roughness. Pressure drops seen for fully developed flow of fluids through pipes can be predicted using the Moody diagram which plots the Darcy‚ÄìWeisbach friction factor against Reynolds number and relative roughness . The diagram clearly shows the laminar, transition, and turbulent flow regimes as Reynolds number increases. The nature of pipe flow is strongly dependent on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Similarity of flows Qualitative behaviors of fluid flow over a cylinder depends to a large extent on Reynolds number; similar flow patterns often appear when the shape and Reynolds number is matched, although other parameters like surface roughness have a big effect. In order for two flows to be similar, they must have the same geometry and equal Reynolds and Euler numbers. When comparing fluid behavior at corresponding points in a model and a full-scale flow, the following holds: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{Re}_\\\\text{m} &= \\\\mathrm{Re}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Eu}_\\\\text{m} &= \\\\mathrm{Eu}, \\\\end{align} where \\\\mathrm{Re}_\\\\text{m} is the Reynolds number for the model, and \\\\mathrm{Re} is full-scale Reynolds number, and similarly for the Euler numbers. The model numbers and design numbers should be in the same proportion, hence : \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{m}}{\\\\rho_\\\\text{m} v_\\\\text{m}^2} = \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho v^2}. This allows engineers to perform experiments with reduced scale models in water channels or wind tunnels and correlate the data to the actual flows, saving on costs during experimentation and on lab time. Note that true dynamic similitude may require matching other dimensionless numbers as well, such as the Mach number used in compressible flows, or the Froude number that governs open-channel flows. Some flows involve more dimensionless parameters than can be practically satisfied with the available apparatus and fluids, so one is forced to decide which parameters are most important. For experimental flow modeling to be useful, it requires a fair amount of experience and judgment of the engineer. An example where the mere Reynolds number is not sufficient for similarity of flows (or even the flow regime ‚Äì laminar or turbulent) are bounded flows, i.e. flows that are restricted by walls or other boundaries. A classical example of this is the Taylor‚ÄìCouette flow, where the dimensionless ratio of radii of bounding cylinders is also important, and many technical applications where these distinctions play an important role. Principles of these restrictions were developed by Maurice Marie Alfred Couette and Geoffrey Ingram Taylor and developed further by Floris Takens and David Ruelle. ;Typical values of Reynolds number * Bacterium ~ 1 √ó 10‚àí4 * Ciliate ~ 1 √ó 10‚àí1 * Smallest fish ~ 1 * Blood flow in brain ~ 1 √ó 102 * Blood flow in aorta ~ 1 √ó 103 * Onset of turbulent flow ~ 2.3 √ó 103 to 5.0 √ó 104 for pipe flow to 106 for boundary layers * Typical pitch in Major League Baseball ~ 2 √ó 105 * Person swimming ~ 4 √ó 106 * Fastest fish ~ 1 √ó 108 * Blue whale ~ 4 √ó 108 * A large ship (RMS Queen Elizabeth 2) ~ 5 √ó 109 * Atmospheric tropical cyclone ~ 1 x 1012 Smallest scales of turbulent motion In a turbulent flow, there is a range of scales of the time-varying fluid motion. The size of the largest scales of fluid motion (sometimes called eddies) are set by the overall geometry of the flow. For instance, in an industrial smoke stack, the largest scales of fluid motion are as big as the diameter of the stack itself. The size of the smallest scales is set by the Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, smaller and smaller scales of the flow are visible. In a smoke stack, the smoke may appear to have many very small velocity perturbations or eddies, in addition to large bulky eddies. In this sense, the Reynolds number is an indicator of the range of scales in the flow. The higher the Reynolds number, the greater the range of scales. The largest eddies will always be the same size; the smallest eddies are determined by the Reynolds number. What is the explanation for this phenomenon? A large Reynolds number indicates that viscous forces are not important at large scales of the flow. With a strong predominance of inertial forces over viscous forces, the largest scales of fluid motion are undamped‚Äîthere is not enough viscosity to dissipate their motions. The kinetic energy must \\"cascade\\" from these large scales to progressively smaller scales until a level is reached for which the scale is small enough for viscosity to become important (that is, viscous forces become of the order of inertial ones). It is at these small scales where the dissipation of energy by viscous action finally takes place. The Reynolds number indicates at what scale this viscous dissipation occurs. In physiology Poiseuille's law on blood circulation in the body is dependent on laminar flow. In turbulent flow the flow rate is proportional to the square root of the pressure gradient, as opposed to its direct proportionality to pressure gradient in laminar flow. Using the definition of the Reynolds number we can see that a large diameter with rapid flow, where the density of the blood is high, tends towards turbulence. Rapid changes in vessel diameter may lead to turbulent flow, for instance when a narrower vessel widens to a larger one. Furthermore, a bulge of atheroma may be the cause of turbulent flow, where audible turbulence may be detected with a stethoscope. Complex systems Reynolds number interpretation has been extended into the area of arbitrary complex systems. Such as financial flows, nonlinear networks, etc. In the latter case an artificial viscosity is reduced to nonlinear mechanism of energy distribution in complex network media. Reynolds number then represents a basic control parameter which expresses a balance between injected and dissipated energy flows for open boundary system. It has been shown that Reynolds critical regime separates two types of phase space motion: accelerator (attractor) and decelerator. High Reynolds number leads to a chaotic regime transition only in frame of strange attractor model. Derivation The Reynolds number can be obtained when one uses the nondimensional form of the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations for a newtonian fluid expressed in terms of the Lagrangian derivative: :\\\\rho \\\\frac{D \\\\mathbf{v}}{D t} = - abla p + \\\\mu abla^2 \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\rho \\\\mathbf{f}. Each term in the above equation has the units of a \\"body force\\" (force per unit volume) with the same dimensions of a density times an acceleration. Each term is thus dependent on the exact measurements of a flow. When one renders the equation nondimensional, that is when we multiply it by a factor with inverse units of the base equation, we obtain a form that does not depend directly on the physical sizes. One possible way to obtain a nondimensional equation is to multiply the whole equation by the factor : \\\\frac{L}{\\\\rho V^2}, where : is the mean velocity, or , relative to the fluid (m/s), : is the characteristic length (m), : is the fluid density (kg/m3). If we now set : \\\\mathbf{v}' = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}}{V},\\\\quad p' = p\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho V^2}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{f}' = \\\\mathbf{f}\\\\frac{L}{V^2}, \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t'} = \\\\frac{L}{V} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}, \\\\quad abla' = L abla, we can rewrite the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation without dimensions: :\\\\frac{D \\\\mathbf{v}'}{D t'} = - abla' p' + \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho L V} abla'^2 \\\\mathbf{v}' + \\\\mathbf{f}', where the term . Finally, dropping the primes for ease of reading: :\\\\frac{D \\\\mathbf{v}}{D t} = - abla p + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{Re}} abla^2 \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{f}. Universal sedimentation equation ‚Äî drag coefficient, a function of Reynolds' number and shape factor, 2D diagram Universal sedimentation equation ‚Äî drag coefficient, a function of Reynolds' number and shape factor, 3D diagram This is why mathematically all Newtonian, incompressible flows with the same Reynolds number are comparable. Notice also that in the above equation, the viscous terms vanish for . Thus flows with high Reynolds numbers are approximately inviscid in the free stream. Relationship to other dimensionless parameters There are many dimensionless numbers in fluid mechanics. The Reynolds number measures the ratio of advection and diffusion effects on structures in the velocity field, and is therefore closely related to P√©clet numbers, which measure the ratio of these effects on other fields carried by the flow, for example temperature and magnetic fields. Replacement of the kinematic viscosity in by the thermal or magnetic diffusivity results in respectively the thermal P√©clet number and the magnetic Reynolds number. These are therefore related to by products with ratios of diffusivities, namely the Prandtl number and magnetic Prandtl number.

High Tech is an option school established by the Cleveland Metropolitan School District (CMSD) and Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C). High Tech prepares high school students for technological careers and/or higher education. The programs develop the student's academic and technical skills particularly in English, reading comprehension, mathematics and information technology. Participating students attend their home high school in the morning and are transported in the afternoon for college courses at Tri-C's Metropolitan Campus in Cleveland until 2:00pm (students may take classes pass the school hours). High Tech graduates are prepared for immediate employment, continuation at Tri-C, or transfer to four-year institution of higher education. In the fall of 2009 Tri-C and CMSD opened another program similar to High Tech; High Achievement Academy open to 11 and 12 grade students at Whitney Young. These students will take their classes at Tri-C's Eastern Campus. Cleveland Metropolitan School District, PNC Bank (formerly, National City Bank) and Cuyahoga Community College are sponsors of High Tech Academy. Background High Tech Academy (HTA) is a dual enrollment program in which high school students in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District and Warrensville Heights High School attend a half day of school at their home school and then attend classes on the Tri-C campuses. Much of the college tuition costs are paid through a state-supported plan entitled Post Secondary Enrollment Options, which allows college level classes to also count toward students‚Äô graduation requirements in high school. The program focuses on computer technology, business and academic core courses. The Cleveland District provides a principal, and the College provides a program manager and together they coordinate programming for 200-300 high school students annually. There are some entry requirements for the program and all students apply through the guidance counselors at their home high school. In some cases, students can earn an associate's degree at the same time they are earning a high school diploma. Students may apply to HTA in the spring term of their freshman or sophomore year. John Hay, Whitney Young and James Ford Rhodes are the leading schools in HTA. The majority of HTA's 2009-2010 enrollment comes from these three schools. Requirements * Maintain attendance (98%-100%) * Maintain academic standards (3.0 or higher GPA) * Maintain a high standard of conduct * Attend six Student Success Workshops or Career Seminars each year * Complete fifteen hours of community service each year * Submit a completed Application packet, which includes an essay and two letters of recommendation * College English and mathematics assessments * An interview with the student and parent * All seniors attend all High Tech Academy graduation activities during their senior year in addition to their high school's graduation ceremonies.

Choricarpia subargentea) is a rare Australian rainforest tree, growing near Mullumbimby in north eastern New South Wales and from Boonah to Imbil in south eastern Queensland. Common names include giant ironwood, ironwood box, scrub ironwood and lancewood. The New South Wales habitat of Backhousia subargentea is dry rainforest thickets on hillsides near Mullumbimby. It grows in association with the shatterwood and wild quince.  Description  Backhousia subargentea is a small tree to medium tree, occasionally reaching 30 metres in height. However, it is much smaller in New South Wales, reaching only 8 metres high and with a stem diameter of 20 cm. The trunk is often multi-stemmed and crooked, not cylindrical in cross section with some buttressing at the base. The trunk can be smooth and glossy, of an attractive orange/brown or pinkish/mauve colour, or green where bark has recently been shed. Other times, the bark sheds irregularly resulting in a mottled trunk, similar to the spotted gum and the leopardwood. The leaves are opposite, simple and entire, lanceolate or broad with a fine leaf tip, around 4 to 8 cm long. The leaves are glossy dark green above, and greyish fawn below. Crushed leaves have a familiar eucalyptus scent. (Both plants being dry fruited myrtles). Oil dots are evident when viewed with a magnifying glass. The midrib and lateral leaf venation is only visible on the top surface. An intramarginal vein surrounds the leaf, about 2 mm from the edge. Leaf stalks are 5 to 10 mm long, with scaly matter on the stalk. Flowers are white, densely together in globular heads, 5 to 8 mm long, appearing in April. The fruit matures around six months later as a small dry capsule, 5 mm in diameter on a stalk 6 to 10 mm long. Uses If not so rare, it could possibly be used as an ornamental tree.

The first book, simply entitled The Word of the Lord, is used by members of the Church of Christ (Fettingite), the Church of Christ at Halley's Bluff and the Church of Christ (Restored). The second, called The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel, is accepted only by the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, and churches derived from it, such as the Church of Christ (Assured Way). Both books contain revelations allegedly given to former Church of Christ (Temple Lot) Apostle Otto Fetting by an angelic being who claimed to be John the Baptist. The latter title also contains revelations purportedly given to William A. Draves by this same being, after Fetting's death. Background =Otto Fetting= The Word of the Lord originated in the claimed angelic visitations of John the Baptist to Otto Fetting, an Apostle in the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) who lived in Port Huron, Michigan. These visits commenced in February 1927,http://www.elijahmessage.net/files/message1.html and ended with Fetting's death in January 1933.http://www.elijahmessage.net/files/message30.html Directives were given to build the long-awaited temple in Independence, Missouri, together with instructions about its dimensions and Temple Lot doctrine and practices. While the first eleven of these messages were enthusiastically accepted by the Temple Lot organization, the twelfth messagehttp://www.elijahmessage.net/files/message12.html caused considerable controversy. Mandating rebaptism for those who had come into the Church of Christ from other Latter Day Saint denominations (contrary to Temple Lot practice at that time), this message was rejected by the leadership of that organization during a church conference October 6‚Äì7, 1929, and Fetting was \\"silenced\\". Unwilling to continue under such a restriction, Fetting left the Temple Lot church and founded his own organization, the Church of Christ (Fettingite). The Temple Lot organization retained possession of the Temple Lot and other church properties. =William Draves= Four years after Fetting's death in 1933, a young Fettingite elder named William Draves claimed that the \\"messenger\\" had come to him, with further revelations for the Fettingite organization. While many Fettingites accepted Draves' claims, some did not, and this led to a split in Fetting's church in 1939. Those who accepted Draves formed the Church of Christ With the Elijah Message, while those who rejected him remained in the original Fettingite organization; it subsequently split during the 1950s over the introduction of Seventh-day Sabbatarianism. This separation between Draves' organization and the Fettingite remnant continues, with each group proclaiming itself the true continuation of Fetting's work. William Draves was ordained an apostle in his new organization, and continued to receive alleged visitations from John the Baptist until his death in 1994. =Testimonies about the Messenger= Otto Fetting emphasized the ability to physically feel the touch of this alleged angel, indicating in his 1929 testimonial that he \\"felt his hand on my head, and the slap on my shoulder\\". Draves, too, indicated that he could feel the visitor's touch on his shoulder, and felt him hold his hand. In addition to the testimonies of the two \\"scribes\\" (Fetting and Draves), the book contains an additional testimony of four witnesses who saw the angel during his final visit to Fetting in 1933. This latter testimony is signed and notarized. In the preface to his first message, and in his 1940 personal testimony about the heavenly \\"messenger\\", William Draves wrote the following: :\\"The messenger wears a white robe, his hair is a tiny bit gold next to his skin and blended to whiteness like pure wool, white as snow. His eyes are like a flame and his feet like the brightness of fine brass, as if they were ablaze. His voice has the sound of one having authority. His countenance is as the brightness of the sun with its greatness in light, even brighter than light that shineth down on the earth. He is enveloped in light and immediately around him is very bright\\". Because the messenger could be seen and touched, some in Draves' church have expressed a belief that the messages in the Word of the Lord are not revelations, since for a revelation (according to them), the author is unseen. The books =Overview= Both the Fettingite and Elijah Message editions of The World of the Lord are divided into sections of varying lengths, called \\"messages\\". In each message, John the Baptist speaks in the first person, claiming to fulfill prophecies given in Malachi 3:1 and Malachi 4:5-6, where \\"Elijah the prophet\\" is promised before the coming of the \\"great and dreadful day of the Lord\\". This latter verse is also referred to by Jesus Christ in Matthew 11:17, where the relationship between Elijah and John is clarified. The Messengeras he is called by Fetting and Dravesalso claims to be fulfilling Deuteronomy 18:15-19's prophecy of a prophet like Moses, and to be the angel \\"flying in the midst of heaven\\" mentioned in Revelation 14:6. He claims to be purifying the Levites in preparation for the Lord's return. The Word of the Lord covers a wide array of topics, containing encouraging words, warnings of dark events (but also of a bright future, ultimately), appointments to church office, visions, and several prophecies. The early portion of the Word of the Lord (common to both editions) contains detailed descriptions of architecture for the temple which is to be built on the Temple Lot in Independence, Missouri. This temple is described in the Articles of Faith and Practice for the church, which quotes from the original prophecy on this subject made by Joseph Smith, Jr., founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. =Fettingite editions= Editions of The Word of the Lord utilized within those Fettingite organizations who rejected William Draves all contain only the thirty \\"messages\\" given to Otto Fetting. At least two of these organizations are extant today, and at least one still publishes an edition of this work. =Elijah Message edition= The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel is subtitled, \\"A warning to all people on the second coming of Jesus Christ, revelations on the building of the temple, and instructions to the Church of Christ: The Lord has spoken and revealed his purpose by the mouth of his servant John the Baptist\\". The book is divided into 128 sections, on 3 levels, all with a view: the thirty messages originally given to Fetting, and ninety more allegedly given to William Draves. Some of its revelations include a description of the course and end of World War II written in 1939. Describing the end of the war, Draves writes: \\"I saw that Germany was no more; she had become divided, part of her going to America and part joining with the armies of the man at Rome. Great Britain was also broken up never again to be united as an empire.\\" However, Draves prophesied that the war would last seven years, and although it ended as described here, it only lasted six. The \\"man at Rome\\" is a cryptic character. Another message, first published in 1968, contains the prophecy: \\"The great powers, not of God's will, will find their failing and end. This will consummate in 1989.\\" Church members believe this alludes to the end of the Cold War. This same message states that 'Armageddon' would begin in \\"the nineties\\" (1990s). Some believe this may refer to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, and the ensuing chain of events.

They begged for help from the Bhrigus, who at that time were very rich; but the Bhrigus refused to help the kings, saying that wealth which is once given to a Brahmin cannot be taken back. To protect their wealth they buried their gold in a secret place. Coming to know about this the Kshatriya kings invaded the ashrams of the Bhrigus and killed all the Bhrigus, not sparing even children that were growing in the wombs of their mothers. Although the Bhrigus were also descended from a warrior class, they could not stop the kings from slaughtering them. One woman concealed her just-born son in her thighs to protect the baby from being slaughtered. The Kshatriyas who came to know about this rushed towards the lady to kill the baby. The baby fell down from her thighs with such a radiance that all the persecutors were blinded instantly. Since the child was produced from the uru (thigh) of a woman he was called Aurava/Aurva.

Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam featured many new characters and several returning characters from the earlier Mobile Suit Gundam anime television series.  Protagonists  = A.E.U.G = ; : The protagonist of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Kamille Bidan is a troubled teen who has become estranged from his parents, both mobile suit developers. A scuffle with Titans officer Jerid Messa over his female-sounding name begins a series of events that eventually results in Kamille helping Quattro Bajeena to steal the RX-178 Gundam Mk-II prototypes and the deaths of both of his parents. Under the tutelage of Quattro and former Titans officer Emma Sheen, Kamille later became one of AEUG's top pilots during the Gryps Conflict‚Äîfirst using the stolen Gundam Mk-II and later in his personally designed Zeta Gundam. Over the course of the series, Kamille's rivalry with Jerid intensifies as both end up killing friends and loved ones of the other. One such example is the cyber- Newtype Four Murasame, whom Kamille met while in Hong Kong and fell in love with. When the two reunite at the Battle of Kilimanjaro, Four is killed by Jerid while attempting to save Kamille's life. Although Kamille survives the Gryps Conflict, the battle with Paptimus Scirocco leaves him in a near comatose state. According to Tomino, Kamille has the strongest Newtype powers in the series. : Kamille, along with five other notable mecha and pilots from the various Gundam series, were recognized in the second set of \\"Anime Heroes and Heroines\\" stamps, released in Japan in 2005. In an interview for the laserdisc release of Zeta Gundam, Tomino states that Kamille was named and modeled after Camille Claudel, a sculptor and lover of Auguste Rodin who became deranged and ended her life in commitment.Interview text in Japanese In the Animage Anime Grand Prix poll from 1986 Kamille was voted the first most popular male anime character. He has also been voted as the eighth most popular male character from the 1980s by Newtype readers. ; : Fa Yuiry is the next-door neighbor of Kamille Bidan before the Gryps Conflict begins. After Kamille helps the AEUG officer Quattro Bajeena steal two Gundam Mk-II prototypes, the Titans arrest Fa's parents because of her close association with Kamille. Fa escapes with the help of Bright Noa and reunites with Kamille when Bright's shuttle is rescued by the AEUG ship Argama. Having sided with the AEUG, Fa stays on the Argama and becomes the pilot of the Methuss, rotating with Reccoa Londe. She also becomes a surrogate mother to two war orphans, Shinta and Qum, after they are sent to the Argama by Lt. Quattro. Fa and Kamille constantly quarrel with each other, so much so that the crew of the Argama refers to the quarreling as their hobby. However, Fa becomes jealous whenever Kamille shows an interest in another female. Fa is one of the few characters that survive the Gryps Conflict and even rescues Kamille after his last encounter with Paptimus Scirocco. ; \\"Quattro\\" (Number 4 in Italian) as Casval Deikun's fourth alias name : No longer wearing a mask, Char Aznable returns to the Earth Sphere and infiltrates the Earth Federation Forces using the humorous alias \\"Quattro Bajeena\\", which can be romanized as quarter vagina in reference to the James Bond film Octopussy. Char joins with other Federation officers, including former enemies such as Amuro Ray and Bright Noa, and becomes one of the top pilots of the AEUG. Char serves as Kamille Bidan's mentor in the war against the Earth Federation's oppressive Titans organization. : Despite repeating prodding of his comrades, Char refuses to take a leadership position within the AEUG maintaining his Quattro facade and stating that he is merely a pilot. However, this changes after the death of Four Murasame when Kamille states that he will no longer refer to him as Quattro Bajeena. Char's political speech in front of Federation Assembly in Dakar, which is broadcast throughout Earth and Space, is one of the most important events in the UC Gundam timeline. It seals Char's total commitment toward space colonization and migration of humanity to space. Despite AEUG's victory in the Gryps Conflict against the Titans, Char is defeated in the final battle by Haman Karn, leader of the Axis faction and assumed dead. However, as the final credits roll, Char's damaged Hyaku Shiki floats by with its cockpit hatch open. ; : Lieutenant Junior Grade Emma Sheen is a former Titan pilot who defected to the AEUG after witnessing firsthand the cruel tactics of Bask Om. She is initially placed on provisional status, but it does not take long for her to prove herself in the eyes of the Argama crew. Emma first pilots the Rick Dias for the AEUG, and then Kamille's old repainted Gundam Mk-II after Kamille transfers to the Zeta Gundam. Emma meets her end when she is caught in an explosion caused by Yazan Gable and fatally injured by shrapnel. Emma would soon be retrieved by Kamille, but she then dies in his arms. ; : : : Former captain of White Base during the One Year War, Bright, like most of his comrades, was alienated by the Earth Federal Space Forces. He was assigned to captain the shuttle spacecraft Temptation. He gets beaten up by Bask Om and several other Titans officers when he objects to a set of orders coming from him. Bright defects to the AEUG to aid their struggle against the Titans. Considering his veteran experience in mobile suit warfare, AEUG then commissions Bright as captain of the AEUG spaceship Argama. Bright finds himself working with his former adversary, Char Aznable and later they form the core military leadership of AEUG. Several highlights of Bright's tour of duty above Argama are the attack on Federation Headquarters at Jaburo and Kilimanjaro, Operation Maelstrom, and the final three-way battle between the fleet of AEUG, Titans, and Axis near the Gryps Two space colony. After the climatic battle at Gryps Two, the AEUG fleet is left crippled with Bright being the sole experienced military commander within the ranks of AEUG leaders. ; : Lieutenant Junior Grade Apolly Bay is initially one of two wingmates to Quattro Bajeena. He later becomes chief of the AEUG ship Argamas Rick Dias team. Apolly is an experienced soldier who provides valuable support to his fellow pilots and a dose of wit as well. He is killed by Jerid Messa when he takes a shot that was meant for Fa Yuiry. The rest of the Argama crew are visibly saddened after his death. ; : Lieutenant J.G. Roberto is the second wingmate first seen entering the colony with Quattro and Apolly to acquire information about the Gundam Mk-II prototypes. He also pilots a RMS-099 Rick Dias. Roberto is seen as more serious and diligent than the wise cracking Apolly.https://web.archive.org/web/20040204171034/http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/uc/zeta/characters/chara_roberto.html He dies during an attack by Titans ace Buran Blutarch while helping Kamille and Quattro ensure that a space shuttle transporting Apolly and several other AEUG pilots back into space. Apolly witnesses his death from a distance and chokes back tears just as the shuttle launches. ; : Commodore Blex Forer is the initial leader of the AEUG. With the formation of the Titans after Operation Stardust, Blex was one of the first to see the increasing corruption in the Earth Government. He used his senatorial position as Commodore in the Federal Navy to influence certain executives of Anaheim Electronics to fund an anti-government movement. Anaheim, whose business interests were partially disrupted by the trade embargoes placed by the Federation on the colonies saw this as feasible. Thus Blex Forer became the founder of the Anti Earth Union Group or AEUG. Blex Forer would continuously clash wills with Titans leaders Jamitov Hymem and Bask Om in their brutal tactics against spacenoids. Blex operated from the ad-hoc flagship of the AEUG, the Argama, closely working with Henken Bekkener as co-captain. Blex meets his end in Dakar when he is assassinated in his hotel room. Blex, with his dying words, beseeches Quattro Bajeena to assume his rightful name of Char Aznable and take on leadership of AEUG. ; : Henken, a ship captain in the AEUG is first seen in command of the Argama. He works closely with Quattro Bagina and AEUG founder Blex Forra. A tall, burly, jovial and good natured man, he nonetheless takes his job seriously and even turns over command of Argama to Bright Noa, acknowledging Bright's professional experience. Henken subsequently transfers to the Irish- class battleship Radish. Henken is attracted to Emma Sheen and Emma shyly but good naturedly reciprocates the affection somewhat. Henken is killed in battle when he maneuvers the Radish to draw Yazan Gable's fire from Emma. ; : Ensign Reccoa Londe is a former guerilla fighter from the One Year War who later joined the AEUG in their fight against the Titans. A skilled pilot and spy, she also helped AEUG newcomer Kamille Bidan adjust to his new position aboard Argama. She was also one of the first to welcome Titans defector Emma Sheen despite widespread suspicions and helps her realize that she made the right choice; most notably by proving to her that the infamous 30-Bunch incident (where an entire colony was killed by poison gas) was carried out by none other than Colonel Bask Om of the Titans. : Lonely and ignored by her love Quattro, Reccoa later does the opposite of Lieutenant Emma and joins the Titans due to the influence of Paptimus Scirocco. She even goes so far as to lead a mission using poison gas to exterminate another colony as ordered by Bask, whom she later kills. Reccoa is killed by the combined efforts of Emma Sheen and Yazan Gable. ; : Katz was one of the three war orphans aboard the White Base during the One Year War that were later adopted by Hayato Kobayashi and Fraw Bow. He along with his adoptive mother and siblings pay Amuro Ray a visit. Katz is initially disgusted by what he perceived as his former hero's cowardice and made that perfectly clear to him. However, he and Amuro later join up with Hayato along with some other members of Karaba and the AEUG on board the Audhumla and later he goes up into space with Quattro Bajeena. Katz shows some skill as a pilot and helps save the plight of his fellow pilots on numerous occasions. However, his naivete and recklessness makes him a thorn in the side of his superiors and led to his downfall. He constantly defies his superior officers by sortieing without their permission. : Katz develops an interest in Sarah Zabiarov after she boards the Argama to warn them about an impending colony drop. Despite the fact that she initially deceives him in order to escape, Katz still harbors feelings for Sarah and hopes to free her from Scirocco's influence. Katz is killed when Yazan Gable shoots him down in the G-Defenser. ; : Wong Lee is a top official at Anaheim Electronics Company, which is the equity participant of AEUG. Although he is a civilian, he takes it upon himself to assault Kamille, who was occupied with repair of Haro and was late for the meeting as a punishment for him breaking military rules. After that he got in Argama, made orders carpingly to Bright Noa and Quattro Bajeena. Bright becomes fed up with Wong when he tried to communicate with Reccoa during a battle and orders him to sit down. Wong grudgingly yields to Bright in the end and leaves the Argama after it stops at La Vie En Rose for resupply. = Karaba = ; : : The famous pilot of the original RX-78-2 Gundam during the One Year War. Amuro was placed under house arrest shortly after the war due to the government's mistrust of Newtypes. While he lived in a luxurious mansion and was officially free to come and go as he pleased, Amuro's house servants were actually government agents assigned to keep track of his movements. Amuro worked as a trainer/adviser in the Cheyenne Mobile Suit Academy up until the time of the Gryps Conflict. He suffers from chronic combat fatigue, as commented by Emma Sheen and Beltorchika Irma, likely from his traumatic experience during the One Year War and the sense of guilt over killing Lalah Sune. : During the Gryps Conflict, a pregnant Fraw Bow and her three adopted children (Katz, Letz, and Kikka) come to visit Amuro. They manage to re-ignite Amuro's fighting spirit and help him escape from his government handlers. After joining Karaba, AEUG's earth-bound ally, and some initial hostility with Quattro/Char, Amuro becomes a key figure within the group, leading several crucial missions including the attack on the Titans' base in Mount Kilimanjaro and the seizing of Federation's Congress Building in Dakar. ; : : Former crew member of the White Base and pilot of the RX-77 Guncannon during the One Year War, now a freelance journalist. Kai helps Reccoa Londe infiltrate the Jaburo base but ends up getting them both captured. Luckily, the two of them are later rescued by Kamille. he promptly vanishes after leaving a message for Hayato and Amuro informing them that Quattro Bajeena is actually Char Aznable. ; : : Another former crew member of the White Base and pilot of the RX-75 Guntank during the One Year War, Hayato Kobayashi is now married to Fraw Bow and the adoptive father of Katz, Letz, and Kikka. He is the owner of the Kennedy Space Museum and leader of the Earth-based anti-Titans group, Karaba. ; : A member of the Earth-based anti- Titans group, Karaba, who joins up with the Audhumla while en route to Hong Kong City. Upon meeting Amuro Ray, Beltorchika takes an immediate interest and latches onto him, much to the chagrin of her comrades, especially Kamille. Beltorchika later plays a crucial role in the Battle of Dakar. At one point, the Titans try to stop this speech regardless of the safety of the people at the summit, including their own supporters. Beltorchika captures this on video, revealing the Titans' brutality to the whole world. After the battle, Beltorchika and Kamille engage in their friendliest conversation yet. She is last seen manning a gun turret on the Audhumla as Kamille and Char make their way back into space. : Beltorchika and Amuro appear to be on the brink of a serious relationship, but he is later seen with someone else named Chan Agi in Char's Counterattack. No explanation as to what might have happened between him and Beltorchika is provided in the film. However, Yoshiyuki Tomino penned a novelized version of the film titled Beltorchika's Children. In this, Beltorchika acts in the same role that Chan does; however, in the book, she is pregnant with Amuro's child and survives the events of the novel.  Antagonists  = Titans = ; : Lieutenant Jerid Messa is the archrival of protagonist Kamille Bidan. Their rivalry began over a mere scuffle that was instigated when Jerid made fun of Kamille for being a boy with a girl's name. It intensifies later when Jerid kills Kamille's mother while she is being held captive inside a capsule that he believed was a bomb, which would have destroyed the Gundam Mk-II that Kamille was piloting. Throughout the rest of the series, the two of them are constantly at odds with each other, killing several other friends and loved ones until Kamille finally kills Jerid during the decisive final Battle of Gryps. Before that happened, however, Jerid piloted several different mobile suits and displayed superb battle skills as he began to unlock his Newtype potential as witnessed when he attacks the Axis flagship Gwadon during the fall of the Gate of Zedan. Haman Khan, a powerful Newtype, senses a psychic pressure emanating from him as he approaches her ship in retaliation for her attempt to assassinate Jamitov Hymem. Also in his final battle Jerid piloted a Baund Doc, which is a mobile suit designed exclusively for Newtypes. However, he is still unable to gain the upper hand against Kamille and winds up losing to him in their final battle, being sent flying into the exploding battleship Radish. With his last breath, Jerid curses Kamille's existence, as a barrier to his ascension in the ranks of the Titans. ; : Paptimus Scirocco, known as \\"the man from Jupiter\\", is a very powerful Newtype summoned by the Titans for his excellent piloting and mechanical skills who quickly rises to the top of the Titans' leadership, making him the primary antagonist of the series. He also exhibits great charisma, which allows him to easily manipulate people, and with his charms he especially seems to influence women, such as Reccoa Londe and Sarah Zabiarov. Reccoa would eventually betray the AEUG due to his influence and Sarah would later sacrifice herself by taking a blow that was meant for him. : Throughout the course of the series, Scirocco along with his minions executed all kinds of underhanded plots to help him assume control over the Titans and eventually the Earth Sphere. When Jamaican Daninghan attempts to drop a colony on the lunar city Granada, he sends Sarah to the Argama and alert the AEUG so that they can successfully thwart Jamaican's plan. He inexplicably allows Reccoa to leave his ship Jupitris after sensing that she was a spy, an act that continues to dog Reccoa until she finally defects from the AEUG and joins him. He also successfully forges a brief alliance with Axis, but Haman Karn later disables the Gryps 2 Colony Laser and sends the Axis asteroid flying into the Titans' stronghold at the Gate of Zedan. Eventually, Scirocco pulls off a coup d'etat by assassinating Jamitov and blaming Haman for it. : In his final appearance, Scirocco fights a four-way battle with Kamille, Char, and Haman that ultimately leads to him fighting Kamille alone. Towards the end of this fight, Kamille calls upon the spirits of several other characters, AEUG and Titan alike, to lend him their strength in order to defeat Scirocco. The power exhibited by the bio-sensor system of Kamille's Zeta Gundam causes the control of Scirocco's mobile suit PMX-003 The O (which is also equipped with a bio- sensor) to be overridden. Kamille quickly transform the Zeta into its Waverider form and rams it into The O, impaling Scirocco on the top. However there are two versions of the events that occur in the next few minutes. In the TV version, Scirocco vows he will not die alone and uses his last ounce of strength to deliver a crippling blow that leaves Kamille comatose. However, the movie version scraps this entire sequence. ; : Ensign Four Murasame is the fourth artificially-enhanced cyber-Newtype trained by Murasame Research Lab and pilot of Psyco Gundam. The scientist in charge of the project erased all her memories from her previous life and just gave her number 'Four' as the name. Namikar Cornell, the nurse in charge of her, convinced her that working with the Titans and fighting the AEUG was the only way that she could recover her memories. Four first appears when the Karaba transport ship Audhumla is docked in New Hong Kong for supplies. Here, she meets AEUG pilot Kamille Bidan, and not knowing that he is an enemy, she feels bonded to him, since he is the first person who ever regarded Four as a person in her own right and not as a girl without memories who is bound to become a living weapon. It is only after the truth regarding Kamille is revealed to Four that she chooses to pilot the giant Psyco Gundam and attack both Kamille and the city; her desire of getting her memories back and become a full-fledged person is more important than anything. Kamille desperately tries to calm her down and make her join the AEUG, but to no avail. After the battle, Four helps Kamille and his Gundam Mark II back out into space. During this event, the Psyco Gundam is severely damaged and Four is killed by her superior officer. : However, it was later revealed that Four and the Psyco Gundam survive and are taken to the Titans' Kilimanjaro base in Africa. Once there, the Psyco Gundam is repaired and equipped with an experimental new \\"psyco-control chair\\", further enhancing Four's abilities to control the Psyco Gundam. Furthermore, Four is forced once again to undergo medical experiments in order to increase her powers, almost losing her memories of Kamille. In the beginning of November, UC 0087, the AEUG and Karaba launch an attack on the Titans base at Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa. Led by Amuro Ray, they are also supported by Kamille Bidan and Quattro Bajeena. It is then that Kamille discovers that Four is still alive. Four finally remembers Kamille when he infiltrates the Titans base to save her. Four is glad to see him, but the backlash coming from her treatment as well as her own mental instability become a huge hindrance. In the end, Four is forced once again to fight against Kamille in the Psyco Gundam, but eventually sacrifices herself to save Kamille from Jerid Messa. :The second Zeta Gundam compilation movie \\"Lovers\\" covers Four's first encounter with Kamille and her death while helping him escape into space. Since the Karaba raid is not covered in the films, her reappearance, along with the Psyco Gundam Mk II, is not shown. ; : Lt. Commander Yazan Gable is a cunning and vicious Titan pilot who ascends the ranks through pure skill and power; he does not exhibit any Newtype potential unlike Jerid Messa. Nevertheless, he single-handedly kills more AEUG members than any other Titan pilot during the Battle of Gryps, including Henken Bekkener, Katz Kobayashi, and Emma Sheen. His brutal actions also seal the fates of fellow Titan officers like Jamaican Daninghan, Jerid Messa, and Reccoa Londe. In the movie, he ends up killing Bask Om instead of Reccoa. His ruthless actions anger Kamille Bidan and prompt him to tap into his Newtype abilities in order to defeat Yazan by destroying his Hambrabi. However, Yazan escapes by ejecting in his escape pod. ; : Chief Petty Officer Sarah Zabiarov is a former cadet at the Titans' private Newtype laboratory whose talents caught the attention of Paptimus Scirocco, who quickly recruited her to serve in combat against the AEUG. Although she is a member of the Titans and is fiercely loyal to the scheming Paptimus Scirocco, she still retains a good heart and conscience, which causes her to empathize with the AEUG. Unfortunately, her devotion to Scirocco turns to obsession and it causes Sarah to suffer the same fate as Lalah Sune during the One Year War. : Throughout the series, Sarah undertakes all kinds of tasks to destroy the Argama and the Zeta Gundam, including planting a bomb that would also kill hundreds, maybe thousands, of innocent civilians while the ship is docked in a space port. Still, Sarah is visibly moved by the kindness that Katz Kobayashi shows toward her even after deceiving him. However, it is not enough to free her from her superior's influence as she ends up getting killed by Katz when she takes a shot that is meant for Scirocco. ; : Captain Bask Om is the field commander of the Titans and oversees a lot of the dirty work in their overzealous quest to maintain control over all Spacenoids in light of the events that took place during the One Year War and Operation Stardust. Throughout his tenure, Bask shamelessly orders his subordinates to commit mass murder by gassing entire colonies or firing the Titans' deadly superweapon, the Gryps 2 colony laser. He also used Kamille Bidan's parents as hostages in order to convince the AEUG to return the Gundam Mark II prototypes that they stole from the Titans' headquarters at Green Noa II. After the death of Jamitov Hymem at the hands of Paptimus Scirocco, Bask stood as the only obstacle preventing the latter from acquiring complete control over the Titans. He met his end when Reccoa and several other minions of Scirocco attacked his ship, the Dogosse Giar, while they were executing a mission with Rosamia Badam piloting the MRX-010 Psyco Gundam Mk-II. Due to all the confusion, Bask and his men were easily overwhelmed and defeated when Reccoa destroyed the Dogosse Giar with a direct shot at the bridge, killing Bask. In the movie trilogy, Bask is killed by Yazan Gable instead of Reccoa during the battle between AEUG, Titans, and Axis. ; : Ensign Mouar Pharaoh is a Titan pilot who first appeared at the Battle of Jaburo, where she saved Jerid from the forthcoming nuclear explosion by grabbing hold of his arm just as the overcrowded escape vessel was about to take off and leave him behind. She takes an immediate dislike to Paptimus Scirocco who attempts to seduce her. She and Jerid, however later become lovers. Mouar is fiercely devoted to Jerid and she relentlessly attacks Kamille or anybody else from the AEUG should they gain the upper hand while fighting against him. In her final battle, Mouar jumps in her front of Jerid in order to save him when Kamille fires a shot him with his Zeta Gundam and dies when her Gabthley explodes. Having lost yet another close friend to Kamille, her death causes Jerid to go berserk and begin a relentless attack on the Argama, causing more damage to it than he had up to this point. ; : Lieutenant Commander Jamaican Daninghan is an arrogant Titan staff officer whose smug and condescending attitude alienates the soldiers under his command. Assigned to pursue the AEUG ship Argama after they steal the Gundam Mark-II prototype mobile suits, Jamaican takes command of the cruiser Alexandria and chases the Argama back and forth across the Earth Sphere. However, many of his plans are undermined by fellow Titan Paptimus Scirocco, who is craftily planning his own rise to the top. Jamaican is killed when Yazan lures the Gundam Mark-II to the Alexandria and Emma Sheen destroys the bridge. ; :Jamitov Hymem is the leader of the Earth Federation's counter- insurgent organization known as the Titans, which were formed with the stated purpose of eliminating the remnants of Zeon in light of the events that took place during the One Year War and Operation Stardust. Jamitov deviously arranges the assassination of Commodore Blex Forer, allowing him to convince the Federation Council to hand over full control of the Federation Forces to the Titans. He later appears at the Titans headquarters in Kilimanjaro right when it is under attack by the AEUG and Karaba. Although the AEUG and Karaba eventually overwhelm the Titans and destroy their base, Jamitov successfully launches back out into space. Later at the Gate of Zedan, Jamitov prepares to meet with Haman Karn, the leader of Axis, who attempts to assassinate him after revealing that the Axis asteroid is headed on a collision course with the Gate of Zedan. Later the Axis asteroid does indeed collide with the Gate of Zedan, but not before Jamitov and Bask evacuate with most of their forces intact. In his last appearance, Jamitov attends a conference with Haman and Scirocco, which ends with the latter killing him in order to gain control of the Titans. ; : Lieutenant Rosamia Badam is a member of the Titans and the first cyber-Newtype to appear in the series. She first appears when she was summoned to help Buran Blutarch attack the AEUG/Karaba transport Audhumla with her Gaplant as her opponents are flying over the United States. : Although she winds up being defeated by the combined efforts of Kamille Bidan, Quattro Bajeena, and Katz Kobayashi, Rosamia escapes with her life. Rosamia reappears many episodes later on Side 3's Colony 13, claiming to be Kamille's sister. Although Kamille knows she is not really his sister, he pities Rosamia and takes her back to the Argama, where she is examined by the ship's physician Dr. Hasan. Her tests show that she is a cyber-Newtype, prompting an immediate search by Dr. Hasan and Lt. Quattro. However, with a little help from Shinta and Qum, Rosamia commandeers a Nemo and escapes the Argama. Although she initially helped Kamille in battle (still thinking he is her brother) against her fellow Titans, she eventually turned against him and went back to the Titans. She later fights Kamille again while piloting a Baund Doc, but he convinces her to land on Colony 13 and get out of the cockpit after she relapses into thinking he is her brother. The two of them have a heart-to- heart talk where Kamille tells her about Four Murasame and how she died. But then, Gates Capa and Loren Nakamoto quickly use mind control waves to make Rosamia hostile again. In the process, she nearly kills Kamille but Lt. Quattro intervenes, forcing her and the other Titans to retreat. : Rosamia appears one last time near the end of the Gryps Conflict piloting the Psyco Gundam Mk-II. By this time, she is under the impression that Gates is her brother and he sends her off on a mission to destroy the Zeta Gundam. Kamille senses her presence and sorties, wondering if the voice he heard belongs to Four Murasame. As soon as she spots Kamille in the Zeta Gundam, Rosamia engages him. Their fight ends with Kamille killing Rosamia but not before she reverts back to a child-like state and says, \\"Brother, I found you!\\" ; : Gates is one of the cyber-Newtypes produced at Augusta Newtype Lab. Compared to the other cyber-Newtypes, such as Four Murasame and Rosamia Badam, he is less powerful, but he has stable emotions. He functions as a mentor to Rosamia, and often supervises her when she enters combat. In order to keep her from disobeying orders, Gates had to pose as her brother. The two of them are both deeply linked, and they continue to fight together. However, during a battle on the asteroid \\"Axis\\", he is unable to prevent Rosamia from being killed by Kamille. Gates is able to sense this event, and it has a terrible effect upon him. This event causes his mind to collapse, and he is no longer able to move. He no longer appears again, and his overall fate is unknown. However in the novelization, Rosamia's attempt to protect Kamille in his broken state led to both of their deaths. ; : Lieutenant Junior Grade Kacricon Cacooler, along with Jerid Messa and Emma Sheen, is a member of the Titans' initial trio of Gundam Mark-II test pilots. Forced to surrender his Gundam Mk-II during the AEUG's raid on the Titan headquarters, Kacricon rejoins the battle against the rebels once they reach the moon, serving as a senior partner to the relatively hapless Jerid. Kacricon is killed when he impulsively tries to take down the Gundam Mark-II while reentering the Earth's atmosphere and his ballute is ripped to shreds as his nemesis passes through close to him. Having lost another close friend to Kamille, Jerid swears to avenge Kacricon by killing Kamille. ; : Lieutenant Lila Milla Rira is an ace pilot of the regular Earth Federation Forces, assigned to back up the Titans during their pursuit of the AEUG ship Argama. She initially mocks Jerid Messa for his failure to defeat Kamille in battle, but later agrees to help him become a better pilot after hearing him say he will swallow his pride and listen to her advice. The two of them become friends, paving the way for a possible romantic relationship when they meet again. However, Lila winds up being killed by Kamille after losing her cool in battle with him, making her the first of what would eventually be many pilots to die at his hands. She realizes her error during her final moments and beseeches Jerid not to make the same mistake. ; :Buran Blutarch is an ace pilot of the Titans who pursues the AEUG/Karaba transport Audhumla. He pilots a NRX-044 Asshimar, a transformable mobile suit armed with only a beam rifle. However, Buran puts this mobile suit to good use when he first appears during an assault on the Kennedy Space Center as he manages to destroy one of the two space shuttles that was supposed to carry AEUG mobile suit pilots back out into space and kill RMS-099 Rick Dias pilot Lieutenant Roberto. He continues to pursue the Audhumla across North America and nearly succeeds in destroying it himself but is thwarted by Amuro Ray. Despite help from the Cyber-Newtype Rosamia Badam, Buran consistently fails to sink the Audhumla is killed by Amuro piloting a Rick Dias that formerly belonged to Roberto's wingmate Apolly Bay. = Axis = ; : : Haman Karn is the daughter of Admiral Maharaja Khan and the leader of Axis, the remnants of the Principality of Zeon, serving as regent to Mineva Lao Zabi, the last surviving member of the Zabi family. She also has a rather personal history with Char Aznable, who is now living under the alias Quattro Bajeena. She pilots her own personal mobile suit the Qubeley, which is equipped with a miniaturised psycommu system and 12 remote weapons known as \\"funnels\\" (a simplified version of psycommu controlled weapon system \\"bits\\" equipped in the Mobile Armor Lalah Sune piloted back in Gundam). Her aptitude with the psycommu was extremely high. While she claims to be fighting in order to restore the Zabi family to power, her actions hint an ulterior motive. Nevertheless, both the AEUG and the Titans seek her help in defeating the other. When Char Aznable tries to attack Haman during their meeting aboard Axis' capital ship, negotiations broke down between the two factions, and Axis instead allied itself with the Titans. At a convenient time Axis eventually exited the alliance with the Titans. The war culminated in a battle between Haman, Char and Scirocco, ultimately ending with Kamille in his Zeta Gundam showing up to fight Scirocco's PMX-003 The-O, while Haman in her Qubeley, defeats Char's Hyaku Shiki. In a final conversation between the two, she revealed her affection to Char and asked for his return. Char declined her offer and triggered an explosion within the crippled Salamis cruiser which led to his MIA. ; : : The daughter of Dozle and Zeena Zabi, Mineva Lao Zabi was born during the One Year War which claimed her father's family and ended up in the care of the Karn family after her mother died with Haman intending to use the girl to restore the Principality of Zeon. Though raised in preparation for her role as a figurehead in Karn's scheme, Mineva was actually a lonely little girl who longed for companionship.https://archive.is/20120731192959/http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/uc/zeta/characters/chara_mineva.html Following the conclusion of the First Neo Zeon War, Mineva had been sent into hiding. Mineva resurfaces during the events of Gundam Unicorn under the alias of , having developed Newtype abilities while seeking to end the Third Neo Zeon War.  Others  ; : : Former navigator of the White Base during the One Year War and wife of Captain Bright Noa. She and her children, Hathaway and Cheimin, are taken hostages by the Titans in a bid to make Karaba surrender their transport ship Audhumla while it is docked in Hong Kong City. ; Shinta and : A pair of orphaned children whom Quattro brought back with him to the Argama upon his return from Dakar. They basically play the same role that Katz Kobayashi and his adoptive siblings played on board the White Base during the One Year War. They get into all sorts of mischief, irking the Argama crew. They are entrusted to the care of Fa Yuiry and Haro. They also develop a bond with Rosamia Badam when she boards the Argama under the impression that Kamille is her brother. ; and : A husband-and-wife team of scientists employed by the Titans for the development of the Gundam Mk-II. They are also the parents of Kamille Bidan. Both Hilda and Kamille are well aware that Franklin has a mistress, but Hilda chooses to ignore this because she loves her work too much, which bothers Kamille. Both parents are taken hostage by the Titans in order to coerce the AEUG into returning the Mk-II prototypes that Kamille helped steal. Hilda is killed by Jerid Messa when he fires on the capsule she is in, thinking that it was actually a bomb that would destroy the Mk-II that Kamille was using in order to retrieve her. Disgusted by the Titans' tactics, Titan pilot Emma Sheen helps Franklin and Kamille escape along with all three Mk-II prototypes and take them back to the AEUG. However, Franklin later steals a RMS-099 Rick Dias and winds up getting killed during his attempt to take it back to the Titans. Although Kamille resented his parents for putting up their charade of being a happy family, he is deeply saddened after losing them and cries his heart out. ; : : A former crew member of the White Base during the One Year War and the younger sister of Char Aznable. Because voice actress Y≈ç Inoue was on a safari in Africa during the production of the series, Sayla only appeared briefly in non-speaking cameos. In episode 37, she was seen outside a beachside villa, listening to Char's speech at the Federation Assembly in Dakar on the news. : In the 2005-2006 movie trilogy, Sayla's cameo appearances were deleted, as the Karaba invasion and Char's speech in Dakar did not occur. Instead, she is seen at the end of the third film conversing with Kai Shiden about her brother. This scene used an archived recording of Inoue's voice, as she died of lung cancer in 2003.

He served as Bishop of Natchez (1881‚Äì1888) and Archbishop of New Orleans (1888‚Äì1897). Biography Francis August Janssens was born in Tilburg, North Brabant, to Cornelius John and Josephine Anne (n√©e Dams) Janssens. He studied at the seminary of 's-Hertogenbosch from 1856 until 1866, when he entered the American College at Louvain, Belgium, with the view of dedicating himself to the American missions. Janssens was ordained to the priesthood on December 21, 1867. Arriving at Richmond, Virginia, in September 1868, he became rector of the cathedral in 1870 and served as vicar general under Bishops James Gibbons and John Joseph Keane. On April 7, 1881, Janssens was appointed the fourth Bishop of Natchez, Mississippi, by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 1 from Archbishop James Gibbons, with Bishops Thomas Becker and John Keane serving as co-consecrators. During his tenure he completed construction on the Cathedral of St. Peter the Apostle, which had commenced forty years earlier. Janssens was promoted to the fourth Archbishop of New Orleans, Louisiana, on August 7, 1888, and installed on the following September 16. During his tenure he convened the fifth Archdiocesan Synod in May 1889, founded more than twenty-five new parochial schools, dedicated a new preparatory seminary at Gessen in September 1891, and established the Catholic Institute for Deaf and Dumb at Chinchuba in 1890. Janssens significantly reduced the immense debt incurred by Archbishop Napol√©on-Joseph Perch√©; continuing the work of his immediate predecessor Francis Xavier Leray, he reduced it from $324,759 to about $130,000. Janssens' tenure also spanned the period of hardening racial divisions between whites and blacks. He once said, \\"There is nothing in my administration of the Diocese that worries me more than our colored people; to see what is done by the Protestants to capture them and how often they succeed.\\" Believing that a separate parish would keep blacks within the Catholic Church and facilitate black leadership just as it had for Irish and German immigrants, Janssens established St. Katharine's Church in 1895 as the first parish designated for black Catholics; attendance, however, was optional. It was, however, his expressed hope \\"that anyone might occupy any pew or any seat anywhere in the church.\\" Janssens died aboard the steamer Creole, bound for New York City, aged 53.

Early life Ingenito was born in Wildwood, New Jersey on May 27, 1924, to Ernest and his wife, Helen (n√©e Martin) Ingenito. He was the oldest of three children. The family moved frequently between Wildwood and Philadelphia, and his parents finally separated when he was thirteen. Ingenito first got in trouble for stealing when he was ten and was first sent to a reformatory at fourteen. He continued to go in and out of reformatories for the next few years, until he was paroled and allowed to return to Wildwood to live with his mother. At age 17, Ingenito married 16-year-old Doris Breslin. Breslin became pregnant soon after and later gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter Dorothy. During the marriage, Ingenito was reportedly abusive towards his wife. Two years into the marriage, Ingentio was drafted to serve in the US Army; during World War II, he was stationed at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. He was dishonorably discharged in 1946 after being court-martialed twice: once for going AWOL (Ingenito left without permission after hearing that his wife was living with another man), and a second for striking two superior officers. He served two years of an eight-year sentence at Green Haven Correctional Facility, the military prison at Sing Sing, for the second offense. Ingenito and Doris were later divorced. Marriage to Theresa Mazzoli Shortly after his discharge, Ingenito married 21-year-old Theresa Mazzoli, the daughter of Michael and Pearl Mazzoli, who owned a truck farm on Piney Hollow Road in Franklin Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey. Theresa convinced Ingenito to move in with her family and the young couple initially appeared to have had a happy marriage. Ingenito worked on the farm and they had two sons. While Ingenito got along well with his father-in-law Michael, he did not like his mother-in-law, Pearl. The relationship between Ingenito and his wife and her family rapidly deteriorated after he took an outside job at a local appliance store. When Michael came to believe that his son-in-law was seeing other women, he threw Ingenito out of the house. Ingenito moved a few miles away to board with Al and Kay Rulis, friends of his father. As Theresa proceeded with plans for a divorce, Ingenito reportedly contacted lawyers about seeing his children. In the meantime, he had taken up target shooting and began buying ammunition at local stores for his growing gun collection. Killings At about 8 p.m. on November 17, 1950, Ingenito armed himself with a Luger, a Mauser C96, and a .32 caliber rifle and drove to the Mazzoli house. He confronted Theresa and demanded to see their children; when Michael intervened, Ingenito shot him twice, killing him. As Theresa fled into the adjacent dining room, Ingenito shot her in the stomach and shoulder. When his mother-in-law Pearl fled across the street to her parents‚Äô home, Ingenito followed. He shot her mother, Theresa Pioppi, in the doorway, then stepped over her body to shoot and kill his wife's pregnant aunt, Marion Pioppi. He wounded his wife's nine-year-old cousin Jeannie, then shot and killed Pearl Mazzoli, who tried to hide in a closet. Ingenito also killed John Pioppi, one of Pearl's brothers, who had chased after Ingenito with a knife. Ingenito continued his killing spree, driving to Minotola, where Theresa's aunt and uncle, Frank and Hilda Mazzoli, lived. He shot both of them, in front of their two younger children. Although critically wounded, both survived. Ingenito was arrested by the New Jersey State Police. Although he confessed to the killings during questioning, he later refused to sign a statement admitting his guilt. Sentencing Ingenito was initially sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Pearl Mazzoli. His lawyer, Frank Sahl, was able to persuade the jury that they did not want the responsibility of sending him to the electric chair. While all four counts of assault were dismissed, five years passed before he was brought to court on the four additional murder charges. Although his attorneys initially planned to plead that he was not guilty by reason of insanity, they later changed that plea to one of \\"no contest\\" on all four counts. The judge allowed him to serve all five sentences concurrently. Later years and death Since New Jersey did not have a life sentence without possibility of parole at the time, Ingenito was released in 1974 and lived in Trenton, where he worked for Trap Rock Industries. In 1994, Ingenito was arrested again, this time for sexual assault of the daughter of his girlfriend. Ingenito was found guilty on 29 counts of sexual abuse which took place over the span of six years. On October 7, 1995, Ingenito died in prison of heart failure.

Payton Jr. (February 27, 1876 ‚Äì August 1917) was an African-American real estate entrepreneur, known as the \\"Father of Harlem\\", due to his work renting properties in Harlem, New York City, to African Americans.The National Cyclopedia of the Colored Race. Editor-in-chief, Clement Richardson. Published 1919 by National Publishing Company, Inc. in Montgomery, Alabama, p. 258.Christopher Gray, \\"Streetscapes: 13 West 131st Street; 'Father of Harlem' Called It Home\\", The New York Times, June 16, 1991. Early life Philip A. Payton Jr. was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, on February 27, 1876. He was the second of four children, one girl and three boys. His father was a barber and his mother a hairdresser. His father insisted that the children learn a trade, and so trained him in the family profession twice a week after school. Payton claimed to be a full-fledged barber by the age of fifteen. Dr. Joseph Charles Price, founder of Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina, was a personal friend of Payton's father, and Payton attended the institution, and graduated from the institute in 1899. The effects of an injury persisted for most of the following year. His siblings each had a more complete education. His sister graduated from the state normal school (later Westfield State College), and both of his brothers attended Yale University. Payton worked in the family barber shop until April 1899, when he decided to make more of himself, and left for New York City, against the wishes of both parents. There, he worked as a department store picture and weighing machine attendant at $6 per week, a barber at $5‚Äì6 per week, and finally as a porter in a real estate office at $8 per week. While working as a porter, he got the idea of going into the real estate business on his own. Real estate During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were many African-Americans migrating up north from the American South due to disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow laws. White supremacists formed hate groups and cast crimes upon many African-American families during that time. Also, these were still times that blacks worked as low-paid sharecroppers. All of these factored into the mass Northward movement of blacks during this time. Many of those chose to move into the New York City neighborhood of Harlem, which resulted in the social movement known as the Harlem Renaissance. Payton first got into the real- estate business as a janitor, but after seeing how the business operated, he decided he wanted to create his own firm. Payton and a partner opened the Brown and Payton real estate firm in October 1900. In June 1901, Payton married. The business was unsuccessful, and Brown left in the spring of 1901. Payton continued the business alone, while his wife sewed to support them. At the low point, in April and May 1901, the Paytons' cat and dog died, partially due to hunger, and the Paytons were evicted from an apartment house he had been managing, for being unable to pay their rent. Soon after this, though, business improved. Payton got charge of more houses, and began to deal in real estate for himself as well as for others, until he was making profits of thousands of dollars per month. Sources differ on what was Payton's first break. Several cite an interview in 1911 or 1912 with the New York Age in which Payton recalls: The New York Times states that by 1900, Payton was already managing several buildings housing African-Americans. Yet other sources write that Payton's first success came when he approached the manager of an apartment house on West 133rd Street, which tenants were fleeing because a murder had been committed there, and persuaded him to have the chance to fill it with black families.Nat Brandt, Harlem at War: The Black Experience in WWII, Syracuse University Press, 1996, , p. 27. Afro-American Realty Company Philip A. Payton Jr., circa 1907 On June 15, 1904, with the help of other affluent blacks, Payton chartered the Afro-American Realty Company, issuing 50,000 shares at $10 each. Payton's business partner was a mortician named James C. Thomas. Along with Thomas, Payton formed the Afro-American Real Estate Company. He appealed to black investors specifically, both to their social justice and profit motives, with an ad stating: \\"Today is the time to buy, if you want to be numbered among those of the race who are doing something toward trying to solve the so-called 'Race Problem.'\\" His prospectus claimed: \\"The very prejudice that has heretofore worked against us can be turned and used to our profit.\\"Edward T. O'Donnell, \\"A Neighborhood of Their Own\\", The New York Times, June 6, 2004.\\"A Race Prejudice Mint for Profits in Realty\\", The New York Times, October 27, 1906. In 1905, the Hudson Realty Company, a white-owned real estate company, had bought a tract of land on West 135th Street near Lenox Avenue, in the heart of Harlem, for residential development. To make the development property more attractive to prospective builders, it also bought three neighboring tenement buildings from Afro- American Realty, evicted their black tenants, and replaced them with white tenants. Hudson's builders agreed to only rent their properties to whites. In response, the Afro-American Realty Company bought two adjacent apartment houses, evicted their white tenants, and moved in the blacks evicted by Hudson. Eventually, Hudson sold the original three buildings back to the Afro- American at a large loss. The incident augmented Payton's reputation and drew investors to his company. The New York Times called the moves by Hudson and Afro-American Realty a \\"Real Estate Race War\\".\\"Real Estate Race War is Started in Harlem\\", The New York Times, December 17, 1905. The Afro-American Realty Company bought and leased property in Harlem neighborhoods never until then \\"invaded\\" by black tenants, occasioning near panic among neighboring owners. In July 1906, the New York Herald wrote: White residents were outraged; one sign advertising for colored tenants for a formerly white building was burned to local acclaim.\\"Negro Invasion Threat Angers Flat Dwellers\\", The New York Times, July 21, 1906.\\"'23' The Mystic Sign on Negro Flathouse\\", The New York Times, July 22, 1906. The Afro-American Realty Company grew to $1 million in assets with annual rent receipts of $114,000. It was not as successful as some stockholders had anticipated, though, and in October 1906, 35 of them brought a lawsuit, charging that the prospectus was fraudulent and overstated the company holdings when it was issued. Payton was arrested on civil fraud charges in January 1907,\\"Negroes Charge Payton With Realty Fraud\\", The New York Times, January 30, 1907. and the courts ruled in favor of the plaintiffs for investments, damages, and legal costs, later that year. The company issued its first and only dividend in June 1907, but never recovered from the negative publicity effects of the lawsuit and the depression of 1907, stopping operations in 1908.Encyclopedia of African American business: K-Z, edited by Jessie Carney Smith, Millicent Lownes Jackson, consultant, Linda T. Wynn, consultant, Greenwood Press, 2006. Page 650. . After the Afro-American Maggie Payton and 13 West 131st Street, their home in Harlem Payton continued to buy and manage Harlem real estate for black tenants, founding the Philip A. Payton Jr. Company, known for its PAP logo. He even ventured outside the city to Long Island.\\"Negro After Fine Estate\\", The New York Times, January 23, 1912. John E. Nail and Henry G. Parker, former directors of the Afro-American Realty Company, founded their own company, Nail & Parker Real Estate, in 1907; it eventually became one of the most successful in New York.Encyclopedia of African American business: K-Z, 2006, p. 558. By 1914, The Outlook wrote that three-quarters of the black population of New York City, including all blacks of prominence, lived in Harlem; it called Payton \\"the father of his Negro community\\". The success of Payton's enterprise could be seen in the neighborhood of 13 West 131st Street, the house he had bought for himself and his wife Maggie in 1903. The entire street was white in 1900; by the time of the 1915 New York State census, the block was almost completely inhabited by blacks. Payton closed his largest deal in July 1917, a sale of six apartment houses for about $1.5 million, the largest sale of housing for blacks to that time. The buildings were renamed after prominent blacks in the Americas: Crispus Attucks, Toussaint L'Ouverture, Phyllis Wheatley, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Frederick Douglass, and Booker T. Washington. The black population in Harlem had reached 50,000 or even 70,000.\\"Apartment Houses for Negro Tenants\\", The New York Times, July 11, 1917. Payton died of liver cancer a month later at his country house in Allenhurst, New Jersey; he was 41. His younger brother Edward S.

Independent cities are hatched and do not have magisterial districts. The Commonwealth of Virginia is divided into 95 counties and 38 independent cities, which are considered county-equivalents for census purposes.

He helped to develop the modern version of the social control theory of crime and later the self-control theory of crime. Biography Hirschi was born in Rockville, Utah. He attended the University of Utah in the 1950s, where he obtained undergraduate and master's degrees. In 1955, Hirschi married Anna Yergensen. He spent two years as a U.S. Army data analyst. He received a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968. In his 1969 work Causes of Delinquency, Hirschi posited his version of social control theory. He wrote that social bonds encouraged conforming behavior and prevented most people from committing crimes. In 1977, he and Michael Hindelang published a study which showed that IQ and social class were equally predictive of crime; IQ had been previously discounted as a correlate of criminal behavior. A 1983 paper in the American Journal of Sociology by Hirschi and Michael R. Gottfredson showed that younger age was associated with increased criminal activity independent of any other known factor. In 1990, Hirschi and Gottfredson wrote that lack of self-control, which was tied to parenting issues, was the cause of crime. Hirschi held faculty appointments at the University of Washington, the University of California, Davis, SUNY Albany and the University of Arizona.

The attack resulted in four deaths, including that of the perpetrator, who took his own life. Nine other people were injured. The fitness center is approximately south of Pittsburgh, in the Great Southern Shopping Center, a strip mall located in the Kirwan Heights section of Collier Township. Details The shooting occurred at a women's aerobics class at the LA Fitness center at approximately 8:15 p.m. The shooter entered the class, placed a duffel bag on the ground, turned off the lights, took out two handguns and began firing, police said. According to police, the gunman fired 52 shots with two Glock 9√ó19mm semiautomatic pistols before committing suicide by shooting himself in the head with a .45-caliber revolver. A .32-caliber semiautomatic pistol found in his pocket was not used.George Sodini Posted 2 Web Sites, Online Videos Before Pennsylvania Gym Shooting, ABC News (August 6, 2009) Three women and the gunman died, and about nine other people were injured. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's office identified the three women who died as Heidi Overmier, 46, of Collier Township; Elizabeth Gannon, 49, of Green Tree, Pennsylvania; and Jody Billingsley, 38, of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania.  Perpetrator  George Sodini (September 30, 1960George Sodini, La Fitness shooter (August 5, 2009) ‚Äì August 4, 2009), a 48-year-old systems analyst at the law firm of K&L; Gates and a resident of Scott Township, was identified as the perpetrator. He had written about contemplating carrying out a shooting, which he referred to as the \\"exit plan\\", while also revealing that he \\"chickened out\\" of carrying out such a shooting earlier in the year. His website states that he was \\"never married\\" and concludes \\"Death Lives!\\" Sodini states, \\"Probably 99% of the people who know me well don't even think I was this crazy.\\" Sodini is reported to have left a note inside the gym bag stating his hatred for women. Nearly a week after the murders, it was revealed that Sodini had brought an inert grenade on a Port Authority bus on July 28, 2009. After a passenger sitting next to him notified police, he was questioned about the incident but no charges were filed. On a website registered in his name, Sodini chronicled over a nine- month period his rejections by women and his severe sexual frustration. \\"Who knows why? I am not ugly or too weird. No sex since July 1990 either (I was 29)\\", he writes. \\"Last time I slept all night with a girlfriend it was 1982. Girls and women don't even give me a second look ANYWHERE\\". About his problems with women, he wrote: \\"Women just don't like me. There are 30 million desirable women in the US (my estimate) and I cannot find one\\". In 2008, Sodini posted online videos, in which he discusses his emotions, along with a tour of his home, the latter which was a homework assignment from \\"a self-help seminar [he] had attended on how to date women\\". TGSCOM Inc., an online gun wholesaler based in Green Bay, Wisconsin, sold Sodini an empty Glock 9 mm magazine and magazine loading apparatus used in the attack. TGSCOM sold a used handgun to Seung-Hui Cho, who subsequently used it during the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings. TGSCOM also sold an empty magazine and a holster to Steven Kazmierczak, who shot and killed five people at Northern Illinois University in 2008. TGSCOM closed in 2012, having become the subject of investigations by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Wisconsin Better Business Bureau, and Green Bay police. On August 18, it was revealed that Sodini bequeathed his estate, valued at $225,000, to his alma mater the University of Pittsburgh. A spokesperson for the university stated that it had \\"no interest in receiving any such distribution\\" and requested that it go to the victims and the victims' families. In March 2012, State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. filed a legal motion attempting to preemptively seek exemption from liability under Sodini's $100,000 personal liability policy. Victims of the shooting claim that the insurance company neglected to ensure Sodini got mental health care. Aftermath Flowers and remembrances left at the scene of the August 4, 2009 murder On August 6, 2009, approximately 75 people, including friends, women's rights advocates, clergy members, and local officials, held a vigil at the Pittsburgh City-County Building in downtown Pittsburgh in honor of the shooting's victims. In the aftermath, some feminist groups attributed misogyny and toxic masculinity as a contributing factor.Murray, Jennifer Lynn. \\"The Mass Killer‚Äôs Search for Validation through Infamy, Media Attention and Transcendence.\\" The Death and Resurrection of Deviance.

It is off mile 274.5 of the Richardson Highway in Big Delta. The roadhouse is named after Rika Wallen, who acquired it from John Hajdukovich and operated it for many years. It became a hub of activity in that region of the interior. With the construction of the ALCAN (now Alaska) Highway and the replacement of the ferry with a bridge downstream, traffic moved away and patronage declined. The roadhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and is now a centerpiece of Big Delta State Historical Park, also listed on the National Register.  Background  The Richardson Highway, an important route through the Alaska Interior that contributed significantly to development and settlement of the region, began as a pack trail from the port at Valdez to Eagle, downstream on the Yukon River from Dawson. It was built in 1898 by the U.S. Army to provide an \\"all-American\\" route to the Klondike gold fields during the gold rush. After the rush ended, the Army kept the trail open in order to connect its posts at Fort Liscum in Valdez, and Fort Egbert in Eagle. The Valdez-to-Eagle trail, and its branch to Fairbanks, became one of the most important access routes to the Alaska Interior during the Fairbanks' gold rush of 1902, and the 1903 construction of a WAMCATS telegraph line along the trail. This was accomplished by men of the U.S. Army Signal Corps, directed in part by then-Lieutenant Billy Mitchell, who later rose to the rank of general. Many roadhouses, some 37 in all and some now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, were built along this trail for the convenience of travelers. These roadhouses offered meals, sleeping quarters, and supplies. They were typically located about 15 to 20 miles apart.  Early activity  The Tanana River was one of the major rivers to be crossed by travelers along the Valdez-Eagle trail. A ferry was established just upriver of the Tanana's confluence with the Delta River, at a location then called Bates Landing. Bates Landing was about north of the current settlement of Delta Junction, in the area known now as Big Delta. The government collected a ferry toll on the south side from all those traveling northbound. The WAMCATS telegraph line was relocated to parallel the trail after a fire. McCarty Station was established at the line's crossing of the Tanana in 1907 to maintain the telegraph. Several log cabins housed the telegraph office, a dispatcher, two repairmen and their supplies. A trading post was constructed on the south bank of the Tanana, at Bates Landing in April 1904 by a prospector named Ben Bennett on his claim of , but Bennett sold the post and land to Daniel G. McCarty in April 1905. However, since E.T. Barnette, the founder of Fairbanks, and McCarty's former employer, had financed the goods in the post, Barnette retained ownership of them. The post property, now being used as a roadhouse, soon became known as McCarty's. Another prospector named Alonzo Maxey, and a friend, built Bradley's Roadhouse to compete with McCarty's and by 1907, McCarty's had been transferred to Maxey.  Hajdukovich era  In 1906, or perhaps sometime after, Jovo 'John' Hajdukovich (), an entrepreneur who had come to Alaska from Montenegro in 1903, sensed a business opportunity and purchased the trading post and roadhouse from Maxey. Hajdukovich built a new and bigger roadhouse in 1909 using logs floated downriver. He continued to use the old trading post to store his gear. Hadukovich had other business interests, including prospecting, freighting, acting as a hunting guide by taking hunting parties into the nearby Granite Mountains, and trading with, and advocating for, the Athabaskan natives. (Later he was instrumental in founding the Tetlin Reserve.as mentioned in the review at ) After he was appointed as US Game Commissioner for the area, he could no longer personally operate the roadhouse full-time. As with many informally managed roadhouses, Hadukovich asked travelers to \\"make themselves at home and leave some money on the table\\" for what they used. Despite this informality, the operations prospered. Starting in 1904, the trail was improved and upgraded. In 1907, By 1910, the Alaska Road Commission completed the upgrade, making the trail usable as a wagon road. Major Wilds P. Richardson led the project and later became the namesake for the highway. He was promoted to general later in his career.) Stages plied the road, using horse-drawn sledges in winter and wagons in summer. By 1913 the roadhouse was a local center of activity for gold prospectors, local hunters, traders, and freighters. Meanwhile, Erika 'Rika' Wallen, born Lovisa Erika Jakobson in 1874 on a farm near √ñrebro Sweden, immigrated with her sister in 1891 to the United States. They traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota to join their brother Carl Jakobson. There they changed their last name to Wallen to distinguish themselves from the many other Jacobsons and Jakobsons. After Carl died in an accident, the sisters moved to San Francisco, which they heard was booming. Rika took a job as a cook for the Hills Brothers coffee family, which lasted until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1916 Rika Wallen traveled to Valdez, reportedly \\"because she thought Alaska would be like Sweden\\".  Rika Wallen takes over the Roadhouse  Stable with winter ventilation system Privy with wallpaper visible After jobs cooking at the Kennecott copper mine and for a Fairbanks boarding house, Rika Wallen made her way to Big Delta. In 1917, or 1918, she was hired by Hadukovich to manage operations at his roadhouse, then still known as McCarty's. Although Hadukovich had many business interests, he was not always solvent. For example, in later years he failed to be paid for timber he supplied to the ALCAN Highway project due to not keeping adequate records. In either 1918, or 1923, he transferred ownership of the roadhouse to Wallen for \\"$10.00 and other considerations,\\" presumably in lieu of back wages. Their friendship and partnership continued for many years; historians and writers have not been able to define their relationship. Following local custom of naming places for people, the roadhouse was soon named Rika's. At that time, the roadhouse had eleven bedrooms, a living room, and a large kitchen/dining area. By 1925, Wallen had applied for US citizenship, and filed a homestead claim on . She began growing food and raising livestock, including sheep, chicken, and goats. Sheep provided wool that she wove, and the goats provided milk, from which she made butter and cheese. She also raised silver fox, ducks, geese, rabbits and honeybees. She cultivated grain by using a yoke of oxen for plowing. Rika was a talented farmer, and she successfully grew crops where others failed. She developed a heating and ventilation system for her stable to protect the livestock through the harsh winters. When Wallen bought the roadhouse, it still had packed dirt floors and rough wood walls. To improve the interior, she scavenged wallpaper, sometimes using different patterns on different walls of the same room. She made a hardwood parquet floor from wooden kerosene crates collected from the freighters and boatmen who patronized the roadhouse. Her ability to grow crops and to make a pleasant space transformed the inn and its offerings. For meals, she provided fresh milk and eggs, berries, fish, game, and produce picked from the garden and nearby orchard. Afterward, travelers could go to clean, comfortable beds in the multi-story building. A 1929 travelogue of the Richardson Highway described Rika's by the following: \\"a commodious roadhouse boasting of such luxuries as fresh milk and domestic fowls.\\" About 1926, Rika added a wing, which she used for additional living space, a liquor store, fur storage, and the Big Delta (then known as Washburn) Post Office. She was appointed as the US postmaster and served until 1946. Eventually Wallen also homesteaded an adjoining piece of land, bringing her holdings to .  End of an era  The construction of the Alaska Railroad was completed in 1922, but by the 1930s, due to effects of the Great Depression, freight traffic declined on the railroad. In 1935, the Alaska Road Commission tried to force shippers to use the railroad, and raised the toll at the Tanana ferry crossing to almost 10 dollars a ton. The truckers rebelled at this, with some violent skirmishes. Pirate ferry operations were started, lasting until the start of World War II. With the coming of the war and construction of the ALCAN Highway, which connected to the Richardson south of Big Delta, road traffic waned further. The ferry crossing was replaced by a wooden bridge, and later, a larger steel bridge was constructed downriver. This caused rerouting of the highway away from the roadhouse, drawing off traffic and travelers. Wallen operated the roadhouse through the 1940s and early 1950s, although in later years guests were by invitation only. John Hajdukovich died in 1965, and Rika Wallen died four years later in 1969.  Big Delta State Historical Park  According to Judy Ferguson in Parallel Destinies, a biography of Hajdukovich and Wallen: :\\"For fifty years, Rika was a stake in the ground for the roaming John. While John traded and prospected, Rika ran the hub of the Upper Tanana's cross- roads. Her establishment was \\"town\\" to the three hundred people who walked the trails to the Alaskan-Canadian border. John and Rika were the history of the Upper Tanana Valley.\\" Rika's Roadhouse, the adjacent outbuildings, and property are preserved as the Big Delta State Historical Park. In 1976 the roadhouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the entire cluster was listed as the Big Delta Historic District in 1991. The structure was restored in 1984 by Stanton and Stanton Construction (owned and operated by brothers, Eldon and Richard Stanton). It was placed on a new foundation using original timbers, and in some areas, the packing crate floor was restored. It is now operated as a \\"house museum\\"; some rooms have been fitted with 1920s-1930s period furniture and accessories donated by local residents. The property also has a food service facility called the \\"Packhouse Pavilion\\" operated by a local concessionaire. = Contributing Properties = The historical district contains a total of 18 contributing properties, built between 1906 and 1935: * Rika's Roadhouse, , AHRS# XBD-059, built c. 1909. * Valdez-Fairbanks Trail, also known as the Richardson Road, , AHRS# XBD-133. * Prospector's Trail, , AHRS# XBD-134. * Rika's Garden, , AHRS# XBD-135. * Outhouse, , AHRS# XBD-136. * Barn, , AHRS# XBD-137, built in the 1920s. * Springhouse, , AHRS# XBD-138. * Outbuilding, , AHRS# XBD-139, built in the 1920s-1930s. * Windmill, , AHRS# XBD-140, built 1932, replaced by a replica in 1984. * Ferryman's Cabin, , AHRS# XBD-141, built c. 1929. * Alaska Road Commission Vehicle Scales, , AHRS# XBD-142, built 1935. * Alaska Road Commission Storage Cabin, , AHRS# XBD-143, built 1914. * McCarty Station Storehouse, , AHRS# XBD-144, built 1906-1907. * McCarty Station Cabin Site, , AHRS# XBD-145.

It includes the construction of twin 9-kilometre rail tunnels between South Kensington station (north west of the Melbourne City Centre) and South Yarra (in the south east) with five new underground stations. The southern portal for the tunnel is to be located to the south of South Yarra station. As a result, the tunnel will connect the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines with the Sunbury line, and allow these lines to bypass Flinders Street station and the City Loop while still stopping in the Melbourne central business district. The project will allow for the operational separation of various existing lines and increase the capacity of the rail network to metro-style frequencies. The project is part of the PTV Network Development Plan. In February 2015, the State government established the Melbourne Metro Rail Authority, with $40 million in funding, to oversee planning of the project and $1.5 billion to commence land and property acquisitions and detailed route investigation, and a further $3 billion in funding was committed. Most of the project would be built as a public-private partnership, with private sector investors funding much of the estimated $9 billion to $11 billion cost upfront. Early enabling works commenced in late 2016. In late 2017, sections of the Melbourne central business district, including City Square and parts of Swanston Street, were closed to enable construction of the tunnel and stations. The project was originally expected to be completed in 2026, but has now been revised to late 2025. History =Background= Melbourne's original development was at a time when railway technology began to emerge as a feasible and efficient mode of transit led to a symbiotic relationship between the CBD and the rail network which grew to surround it. An almost purely radial system of lines, developed largely before 1930, linked the growing suburbs to the economic hub of the city centre, producing a system which supported a daily flow of passengers into and out of the city to work. Despite the increasingly car- oriented developments of the mid-20th century, the suburban rail lines in Melbourne continued to discourage any decentralisation of employment, leaving the city unusually dependent on its central core when compared to cities of similar size globally. The first underground rail line to be built in Melbourne was the City Loop, which began construction in 1971 and opened gradually between 1981 and 1985. Among its aims were to reduce pressure on Flinders Street station by distributing passengers to three additional stations in the city centre, and to improve the capacity of the railway network's central core by eliminating the need for trains to change direction after terminating at Flinders Street. However, it was not entirely successful in achieving these aims: the four tunnels of the Loop proved to be a capacity constraint on the ten main lines entering the CBD, and the peculiarities of operating four single-direction balloon loops meant that inner-city rapid transit was difficult for passengers. At the same time, the Loop consumed much of the available capital available for investment in the city's rail system; as a result, the extensions to the outer suburban network which had been envisaged as a succession to the Loop itself did not eventuate. Meanwhile, patronage on the network had entered a long period of decline, which culminated in the Lonie Report of 1980 recommending the closure of several lines. Proposed extensions to Melbourne's railway network The need for an overhaul of the existing commuter rail network was first discussed in the early 2000s as unprecedented population growth began to place significant pressure on existing rail infrastructure and constraints on the inner core of the network as it approached capacity. Other problems faced by the network in the first decade of the 21st century included inefficient operations which had developed during years of low patronage, and a loss of corporate memory, caused in part by the privatisation of rail services in the late 1990s, which limited the flexibility of planners in dealing with the burgeoning passenger numbers. Consequently, a large number of services were experiencing major overcrowding in peak periods. A series of planning documents released during the early 2000s, including Melbourne 2030 (2002), Linking Melbourne (2004) and Meeting Our Transport Challenges (2006) identified that significant capacity constraints existed in the central core and on the Dandenong corridor, but did not propose any significant capital works in the city centre, instead suggesting that the issues could be resolved by relatively minor operational changes and construction of a third track to Dandenong. Outside the state government, support grew for a more substantial augmentation of the rail network, with many such ideas based on new underground lines through the CBD. In 2005, The Age reported that it had received a number of proposals from planning experts and engineers for rail \\"loops and arcs\\" in the central city, and publicised a plan published by Monash University professor Graham Currie for a tunnel between the University of Melbourne to the north of the city and South Yarra station to the south-east. Currie's plan also envisaged extensive improvements to the Melbourne tram network, including upgrading lines along St Kilda Road and Chapel Street to light rail standards. In 2006, the state government considered a plan to construct a combined road and rail tunnel beneath the Yarra River to provide an alternative to the West Gate Bridge, but the idea was deemed unfeasible. By 2007, the planned third track to Dandenong was effectively abandoned, with no money provided for the project in that year's state budget, and opposition growing from the Public Transport Users Association and others. Later that year, it emerged that train operator Connex and coordinating authority Metlink were among stakeholders encouraging the government to consider a proposal similar to Currie's, but extended to Footscray in the city's west. Melbourne City Council, on the other hand, proposed a tunnel conceptually similar to the Currie plan, but running from Jewell station in the north to Windsor in the south-east. =Early planning= In 2008, transport planner Sir Rod Eddington handed down the findings of a report into Melbourne's east-west transport needs, following a commission by the Brumby Government. The Eddington Report recommended two key projects in the city centre: an East West Link road tunnel providing an alternative cross- town route to the West Gate Bridge, and a rail tunnel from Footscray to Caulfield via the CBD. According to Eddington, the tunnel would increase the capacity of the central rail network by removing some trains from the City Loop, allowing future extensions to the suburban lines. In December that year, the project was incorporated into the government's Victorian Transport Plan, to be built in two stages: the first from Footscray to St Kilda Road, and the second along the rest of the route. Following the 2010 Victorian election, the newly elected Baillieu Government abandoned the Brumby transport plan, and announced that each of the projects would be individually reviewed, some by a newly created Public Transport Development Authority. Then, in its 2012 budget, the government announced a revised version of the tunnel plan: a \\"Melbourne Metro\\" from South Kensington to South Yarra along a similar city centre route to Eddington's original proposal. The revised project included five underground stations, and was submitted to Infrastructure Australia where it was deemed \\"ready to proceed\\" and listed as the highest-priority infrastructure project in Melbourne. A business case was quickly developed based on the constraints of the existing rail system, which was rapidly approaching its maximum capacity. The Department of Transport commenced geotechnical drillings and route investigations. A dispute between the federal government and state government over the funding for the tunnel intensified in 2013 with the approach of that year's federal election. The state budget in early May revealed that none of the $50 million in planning money allocated the previous year had been spent, with new premier Denis Napthine deferring the project in favour of the East West Link. Despite this, with the release of the federal budget a week later, the government of Prime Minister Julia Gillard committed $3 billion to the project on the condition that the state match the contribution. The remaining money was to be raised by a public- private partnership with the possibility that the contractor could take over running of the line in addition to its construction. However, federal opposition leader Tony Abbott declared that if he was elected to lead a government that year, no Commonwealth money would be spent on urban passenger rail, and that any commitment to the Melbourne Metro project would be revoked. Meanwhile, Public Transport Victoria's Network Development Plan Metropolitan Rail (NDPMR), released in early 2013, identified the Metro Tunnel as the centrepiece of a 20-year strategy for improving the Melbourne suburban rail network. CEO Ian Dobbs, launching the plan, argued that any expansion of the system was \\"impossible\\" without vastly improved capacity in the core of the network. The NDPMR envisaged the tunnel's construction taking place in a wave of major development from 2017 to 2022, enabling the segregation of the rail system into four independently-operated lines, each with their own routes through the CBD. It also outlined a service plan for the tunnel, proposing an initial peak hour flow of 8 trains per hour in each direction. In February the following year, the state government announced that it was considering alternative alignments for the tunnel, because of concerns that cut and cover construction in Swanston Street in the central city would result in massive disruption to traffic and retail activity for an extended period of time. Then, at the launch of its 2014 budget in May, the Napthine government announced that the Metro Tunnel project would be abandoned and replaced with an alternative proposal called \\"Melbourne Rail Link\\". The MRL route consisted of a tunnel from South Yarra to Southern Cross via Kings Domain and Fishermans Bend, where it would join existing City Loop tunnels reconfigured for bidirectional traffic. Furthermore, the government promised that the realignment would enable a Melbourne Airport rail link to be constructed from Southern Cross at the same time. Ultimately, the reconfiguration of the rail network was to have produced similar operational outcomes as the Melbourne Metro plan, with a Sunbury-Dandenong corridor operating directly between Southern Cross and Flinders Street in both directions, but with an additional end-to-end line from Frankston to Ringwood via the new tracks. According to government ministers, the Melbourne Rail Link offered greater capacity increases and less disruption during the construction phase than existing plans. However, it was heavily criticised, including by Lord Mayor of Melbourne Robert Doyle, who described the route change as a potential \\"100-year catastrophe\\" because of its failure to service the Parkville medical and research precinct. Furthermore, the government revealed in the days following the budget that it had not produced a business case for its plan, and that the decision had been taken primarily on the basis of a \\"common sense\\" need to service its urban redevelopment project at Fishermans Bend. Other concerns emerged in the months following the budget, with experts publicly questioning whether the Napthine government had committed sufficient funding, and whether the proposed tunnels could be engineered to successfully avoid the main Melbourne sewer. By November, with the state election approaching, the rail tunnel had become a major point of contention in the campaign, with the government apparently prioritising the East West Link (EWL) road tunnel, and the Labor opposition promising that \\"under no circumstances\\" would it build the EWL if elected. As an alternative, Labor proposed reinstating the original Metro Tunnel plan, which retained the support of senior public servants in the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure. According to this analysis, the original tunnel route performed substantially better than the EWL in a cost-benefits analysis, but no such calculation had been performed for the new Melbourne Rail Link. On the eve of the election, it emerged that the Abbott federal government had redirected $3 billion in funding to the EWL, and would refuse to allow it to be used for the Melbourne Metro project instead, despite mounting pressure to reconsider his intransigence. A Labor state government under Premier Daniel Andrews was elected the following day, and immediately set about cancelling contracts for the EWL. At the same time, however, new Treasurer Tim Pallas conceded that it would be \\"difficult\\" to deliver the Metro Tunnel given the complexities of the funding dispute. In February 2015, the Andrews government announced $40 million in immediate funding to establish the Melbourne Metro Rail Authority, in order to commence detailed planning work along the original route, and promised a further $300 million in its upcoming budget. It also revealed that a $3 billion line of credit established to fund the EWL would be redirected to the Melbourne Metro project. A timeline was provided, with construction expected to commence in 2018 and the tunnel to be open in 2026. Meanwhile, however, the federal government continued to refuse to fund the project, which led some observers to describe Andrews' commitment as a significant political risk. =Funding and detailed planning= On 15 April 2015, the government announced that the MMRA had selected a route along Swanston Street as the preferred option for the project. The announcement revealed that routes under Elizabeth Street and Russell Street had been considered but were rejected on the basis of engineering difficulties and lack of connectivity respectively. For similar reasons, the route selected along Swanston Street was a shallow tunnel above the City Loop and CityLink tunnels, at a depth of and therefore to be constructed using cut-and-cover methods. The announcement was criticised by representatives of city retailers, who claimed that the disruption would cause enormous damage to their businesses; the government acknowledged massive changes to city access but assured retailers they would be treated fairly. Further concerns about the proposed route emerged some days later when it emerged the tunnel would not connect to South Yarra station, and that Pakenham and Cranbourne services would bypass the station when the tunnel opened. Discussions about the funding of the project continued into late April. The state government acknowledged that the Abbott federal government would not make any contribution to the project, but stated that it remained \\"hopeful\\" a future federal government would change the policy. Towards the end of the month, the Andrews government announced that $1.5 billion would be allocated in the upcoming state Budget for the full cost of pre-construction works, land and property acquisition and detailed route investigations, on top of the already announced money for planning. Among the work funded was drilling 140 bore holes to establish ground conditions along the route. However, questions remained about the state government's capacity to fund the remainder of the project, and it was reported that no business case had been completed, despite this being Labor's key objection to the Melbourne Rail Link plan when in opposition. A levy on land tax for commercial properties benefiting from the tunnel, similar to that used on the City Loop and on the contemporary London Crossrail project, was proposed as one possible solution. At the same time the funding announcement was made, MMRA announced it had appointed technical and planning advisors for the project. After the state Budget in May, details gradually emerged of the revised business case for the tunnel, including specific routes and tunnel options. The government's announcement that an interchange to the existing station at South Yarra because of its expense was heavily criticised by opposition parties and public transport advocates. Investigative drilling along Swanston Street began in early June, and in the middle of that month, the state government announced negotiations with the financiers of the cancelled EWL had concluded, enabling the $3 billion credit facility to be redirected to the Metro Tunnel. In August, tunnel boring machines were announced as the preferred engineering option for the sections of the project under the Yarra River. The September federal Liberal leadership spill, which saw Malcolm Turnbull replace Abbott as prime minister, led to new hope for federal funding of the project when Turnbull announced he would consider all transport projects on their merits. In October 2015, the government announced it had abandoned earlier plans to run the tunnel just metres beneath Swanston Street and above the existing City Loop tunnels and instead place parts of the project 40 metres underground between CBD North and CBD South stations. The decision was made to reduce disruption to trams and traders on Swanston Street and avoid removing critical utilities, such as telecommunication lines, from beneath the street. The cost of such a change was disputed, with the government claiming the additional tunnelling expense would be met by the savings of services remaining in place, but opposition parties arguing the change could be up to $1 billion more expensive. With the key engineering details in place, the scope of the project and its associated disruptions gradually became public. The government first announced in October it would compulsorily acquire the properties of 63 households and 31 businesses at several locations on the tunnel route. Later, in November, road closures for up to five years were announced near construction sites, and specific station designs were released for the first time. The first package of works, a $300 million contract for site preparation and services relocation, was opened for tenders by MMRA on 25 November. Early in 2016, geotechnical drilling was extended to the Yarra River, as political arguments continued over the Metro Tunnel's funding arrangements. Having selected a public-private partnership model based on long-term maintenance and commercial opportunities for investment, and with a new business case released publicly, the state government continued to request a significant federal contribution, but the Turnbull government said it would not consider the project until it had been independently analysed by Infrastructure Australia. Despite the ongoing dispute, a shortlist of bidders was announced in late February for the early works package, and the construction timeline continued to suggest a 2016 start to works. Eventually, in the May state budget, premier Andrews and his treasurer Tim Pallas declared that the state would bear the entire cost of the project in lieu of federal funds, using a combination of increased revenues from a strong property market, and an increase to the net debt of the state over the following decade. = Contracting = In June 2016, John Holland was awarded a $324 million contract which includes the excavation of 35 metre deep open shafts adjacent to Swanston Street to enable the underground construction of the two new city stations, and the relocation of up to 100 subterranean utilities. Utility relocations started in July 2016. Ultimately, however, the federal budget released a week later included $857 million redirected from other infrastructure projects to the tunnel; the funds did not represent additional support to Victoria but rather a reallocation of existing contributions. A shortlist of preferred bidders for the project's main contract, the \\"tunnel and stations\\" public-private partnership, was released in August, along with further details of the MMRA's recommended engineering solutions. The bidders were three consortia composed of engineering, construction and finance companies: Continuum Victoria, consisting Acciona Infrastructure, Ferrovial Agroman, Honeywell, Downer Rail & Plenary Group; Moving Melbourne Together, made up of Pacific Partnerships, CPB Contractors, Ghella, Salini Impregilo, Serco & Macquarie Capital; and Cross Yarra Partnership, including Lendlease, John Holland, Bouygues & Capella Capital. At the same time, the MMRA exercised its powers of compulsory acquisition to acquire City Square from the City of Melbourne, well head of the original schedule. Over the following months, further details of the construction process were made public, including long-term road closures and the precise location of construction sites. The revelations included the MMRA's concerns about the impact of tunneling on the structural integrity of CBD buildings, including Federation Square and St Paul's Cathedral. In December 2017, the Government of Victoria selected the Cross Yarra Partnership to deliver the \\"tunnel and stations\\" public-private partnership. = Early works = On 15 January 2017, works officially began on the project, with the partial closure of A'Beckett and Franklin streets in the CBD. Local media noted that the commencement marked almost precisely a decade since the project's inception. The news was followed by Infrastructure Australia releasing a positive assessment of the project's business case and urging the federal government to contribute funding to the tunnel. Meanwhile, a case was lodged in the Supreme Court of Victoria by protest groups in an attempt to force the government and MMRA to reroute the project around the St Kilda Road precinct. Objections to the tunnel's construction were strengthened in February, when the federal government implemented an emergency heritage protection order for the precinct, preventing the MMRA from removing around 100 trees. The Victorian government decried the move as a political stunt, and insisted that the project would go ahead as planned. At the same time, the Liberal state opposition attempted to grant the City of Stonnington planning powers over the project with a motion in state parliament, in order to force the inclusion of a South Yarra station connection, but eventually withdrew when sufficient support could not be secured in the Legislative Council. A major milestone was reached in mid-April when City Square was fenced off for the commencement of construction and staging works. A few days later, the government announced that bids for the major construction contract had been received from each of the consortia selected on the previous year's shortlist. Parkville Station construction progress at the University of Melbourne in February 2018, showing the excavation of Grattan St for the station box Cross Yarra Partnership, led by Lendlease, was named as the \\"preferred bidder\\" for the construction contract in July. The station designs presented by the consortium were released publicly, as well as details of connections to existing stations and streetscapes. Shortly afterwards, Bombardier was announced as the successful tenderer for the signalling and communication systems contract, and supplied plans to build signal control centres in Sunshine and Dandenong. The contract, including a rollout of high-capacity signalling (HCS) between Watergardens and Dandenong, was the first awarded in Australia for HCS implementation on existing rail lines. At the end of August, the state government launched a public naming competition for the tunnel's five new stations, to replace the working names used since the project's genesis. The competition provoked a wide public response, with arguments over whether the names should reflect geographic location, cultural heritage, or tongue-in-cheek references such as Station McStationface. By the time the competition closed at the end of October, more than 50,000 submissions had been made, and the project had gained international attention with author George R. R. Martin commenting on suggestions that the stations be named after locations from his Game of Thrones series of books. However, the government emphasised that the competition was not to be judged by popular demand but by a panel of experts. The selected names for the stations ‚Äì North Melbourne, Parkville, State Library, Town Hall and Anzac ‚Äì were announced in November of that year, with the government deciding on \\"common sense\\" options based on geographic location and ease of pronunciation. The existing North Melbourne station was to be renamed West Melbourne, but in early 2020 the government announced the existing station would not be renamed and the new station would revert to Arden, due to the potential for confusion and the need to relabel thousands of signalling assets. = Major construction = The public profile of tunnel works increased through the end of 2017, with Lord Mayor Robert Doyle complaining that the City of Melbourne's pest controllers were being overwhelmed by rats disturbed by underground works, and a public viewing platform established at the City Square building site. On 18 December, the state government announced that it had finalised its contract with Cross Yarra Partnership, with a value of some $6 billion. Opposition leader Matthew Guy immediately signalled his intention to bring the dispute over the tunnel's design to the 2018 state election, writing to CYP to indicate that he would seek to include a station at South Yarra should his party win government the following year. Despite ongoing legal battles, tree felling in the St Kilda Road precinct began in February 2018, marking the commencement of significant construction in the area and the consortium's commitment to its design solution for the tunnel. Then, on 20 February, the state government released the tunnel contracts, and announced that the original completion date of 2026 had been brought forward to a new target of 2025. The announcement also included a response to the Opposition's intention to renegotiate the design, with Premier Daniel Andrews claiming it would mean a two-year delay to the overall project. In April, further concerns about the tunnel's impact on buildings near its route emerged, with managers of the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Parkville and the Manchester Unity Building in the CBD, along with the University of Melbourne, making submissions to the MMRA suggesting their properties were at serious risk of damage from construction and operation vibration. The authority responded that it would work with stakeholders to minimise impacts and ensure the project did not produce and adverse impacts. In the same month, the state government announced an upgrade of South Yarra station separate from the Metro Tunnel, in order to address the concerns about its lack of connectivity to the project. Following a series of announcements of major rail projects prior to the state budget in May, the Melbourne Metro Rail Authority was renamed Rail Projects Victoria (RPV) to reflect its involvement in projects outside the Metro Tunnel. Final designs and concept images for the new stations were released in May 2018, using materials and features intended to reflect the character of the five station precincts. CYP, RPV and Minister for Public Transport Jacinta Allan expressed their hope that the designs would be accepted and integrated into the Melbourne landscape as new cultural icons following their completion. Then, in June, the state government released modelling demonstrating the project's contribution to improved accessibility in the CBD, with travel time savings from virtually all parts of Greater Melbourne to the Parkville and St Kilda Road areas served by the Metro Tunnel. In April, June and July 2019, multiple rail lines in Melbourne's east were shut down for several weeks to allow construction of the tunnel entrances near Kensington and South Yarra. The first tunnel boring machine began to be assembled in North Melbourne in June 2019. In February 2020, TBM Joan completed the first section of the tunnel from Arden to Kensington, travelling 1.2 kilometres and installing 4,200 curved concrete segments to create 700 rings lining the walls of the tunnel. Two months later, TBM Meg completed the accompanying tunnel, from Arden to Kensington. The third TBM, TBM Millie, began tunnelling to the South Yarra eastern tunnel entrance on 27 April 2020. As part of this process, it was lowered underground and assembled along with its counterpart TBM Alice. It will tunnel 1.7 kilometres to its destination. TBM Alice was released a month later, on 25 May 2020. TBM Joan began tunnelling again, this time towards Parkville, from Arden, on 25 May 2020. The release of TBM Meg towards Parkville meant that for the first time in the project, all four TBMs were tunnelling at the same time. In May 2020, major traffic changes were put in place near Flinders Street Station in order to improve safety around large trucks entering acoustic sheds as a part of the project. Left turns from St Kilda Road to Flinders Street were removed, and the pedestrian crossing between St Paul's Cathedral and Federation Square was temporarily closed. The crossing will likely reopen in January 2022. Project description Scale model of the High Capacity Metro Trains to be delivered as part of the project The project will consist of two 9-kilometre rail tunnels between South Kensington and South Yarra via the CBD with five new underground stations. The line will run from the north-west to the south-east and link the Sunbury line with the Cranbourne/Pakenham line. While the rail tunnel is the centrepiece of the project, further works will also be carried out on a new third turnback platform at West Footscray station and complement existing projects underway on the Dandenong line, to create four 'metro-style' lines which each run independently of each other. This includes the provision of high speed signalling, level crossing removals, track and station improvements and additional train stabling facilities. As part of the Metro project, 65 High Capacity Metro Trains have been ordered to add further capacity to the network. Stations The project involves construction of five new underground railway stations: =Arden= Arden station is to be located near the intersection of Arden and Laurens Streets in North Melbourne. It is planned to allow for urban renewal of the formerly industrial suburb, and is expected to serve some 25,000 residents once complete. The station entrance will be located on Laurens Street, between Queensberry and Arden streets to provide direct access to existing residential, retail and commercial areas east of Laurens Street. Provision will be made for an additional entrance at the western end of the station to service the Arden area as it develops in the future. Arden Station will be within walking distance of the North Melbourne Recreation Centre, Arden Street Oval and the existing route 57 tram. =Parkville= University Square and Grattan Street near the University of Melbourne, site of the under construction Parkville station Parkville station is to be located on the intersection of Grattan Street and Royal Parade in Parkville, in proximity to the Royal Melbourne Hospital and Melbourne University. The station will relieve pressure on north-south tram routes and the congested 401 bus service between North Melbourne station and the university/hospital precinct. New tram stops are to be constructed as part of the project allowing for seamless tram and train interchanges. The station will service the busy hospital and research precinct, including the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre. The station is expected to service 60,000 passengers each day in 2031. =State Library= State Library of Victoria Building 80 at RMIT University, near the future State Library station entrance State Library station is to be located on the intersection of Swanston and La Trobe Streets in the Melbourne CBD above the existing Melbourne Central station. This will allow for interchange opportunities between stations and existing lines and relieve pressure on Swanston Street tram routes. The station will service the northern end of the CBD, as well as the State Library of Victoria and RMIT University. The line will continue under Swanston Street running below the existing City Loop tunnels. The station will serve up to 40,000 passengers once complete. =Town Hall= Melbourne's City Square, which has been demolished for construction of Town Hall station Town Hall station is to be located on the corner of Swanston and Flinders Streets, with direct connections to Flinders Street station, adding further relief to tram services and servicing the southern end of the CBD. The station will be near St Paul's Cathedral, the Arts Precinct, Southbank and Federation Square and have exits on Collins Street. The line will proceed south running below the Yarra River and the Burnley and Domain tunnels. The station is expected to serve some 55,000 passengers during peak periods. =Anzac= Domain Interchange, 2004, site of the under construction Anzac station Anzac station is to be located on St Kilda Road and Park Streets adjacent to the Domain Interchange, with interchange opportunities with existing St Kilda Road tram services. The station will service the Shrine of Remembrance, the busy St Kilda Road office precinct, the Royal Botanic Gardens and Melbourne Grammar School. The station is expected to serve approximately 14,500 passengers during peak periods. Analysis and criticism =Network capacity= The primary stated aim of the project is to increase capacity within the inner core of the metropolitan network, as well as improving reliability and efficiency. It aims to accomplish this by creating a single, end-to-end metropolitan line between Sunshine in the west and Dandenong in the south- east, linking the existing Sunbury, Cranbourne and Pakenham lines and providing them with a dedicated city centre route. Because this re-routing removes services from two City Loop tunnels, more capacity will theoretically be available for the Werribee, Williamstown, Craigieburn, Upfield, Frankston and Sandringham lines. According to official project estimates, the result is a total capacity increase of 39,000 passengers in the city centre for each peak period. However, the need for a new tunnel to increase capacity has been subject to criticism that capacity on the existing network is under utilised or hamstrung by operational inefficiencies, since the project was originally proposed in Eddington's report. Paul Mees in 2008 noted that the claim the new tunnel would allow 40 extra trains per hour through the city should be compared to an increase of 56 trains per hour by increasing line capacity to 24 trains per hour per line (80% of the theoretical 30 trains per hour allowed by the current signalling system), reducing dwell times and other efficiencies such as terminating some trains at Flinders Street station rather than Southern Cross station. Mees also criticised the proposal for absorbing rail investment at the expense of extending the network at its periphery. On the other hand, transport economist Chris Hale has argued that while the capacity increase offered by the tunnel is real and probably more significant than that offered by incremental upgrades to the existing network, the project is the product of poor planning processes in the Victorian transport bureaucracy and consequently reflects a \\"single-issue\\" approach to infrastructure which is inconsistent with contemporary best practice. Hale contends that the tunnel's route, which reinforces existing transport networks and focuses on the inner city as the single connection point of all transport, exemplifies outmoded thinking and, therefore, achieves its primary aims while failing to accomplish more extensive benefits for a similar cost. Ultimately, the business case for the Metro Tunnel considered high-capacity signalling and other network upgrades as alternatives to the proposed route. It concluded that, when compared to the tunnel, upgrading to HCS would produce inferior outcomes because of its limited capacity benefits and its failure to integrate improvement of the existing network with service to new parts of the central city. Additionally, the business case noted that by making incremental upgrades to the rail system without substantially altering its structure, the opportunity for more reliable operations as a result of fully segregated lines would be lost. =Swanston Street tram services= With the proposed route expected to run directly under Swanston Street and towards the south-eastern suburbs, the project will provide much needed relief to existing and overcrowded tram services that run from St Kilda Road into the CBD. Currently, St Kilda Road is the busiest tram thoroughfare in the world, with up to 10 tram routes running into the CBD via Swanston Street. The Melbourne Metro is expected to relieve this pressure by allowing commuters to catch the train into the Domain Interchange and CBD from either the north-west or south- eastern suburbs, avoiding already congested tram routes. In particular, many of the existing tram routes that run through St Kilda Road terminate at Melbourne University, which will be more easily accessible from the nearby Parkville station when the Melbourne Metro is complete. Concerns existed over expected disruption along the Swanston Street corridor, with former Premier Denis Napthine controversially describing the alignment of the tunnel as akin to the Berlin Wall, which would \\"tear the city in half for up to two years\\". However, changes to engineering and construction plans allowed for tunneling, rather than the 'cut and cover' method of construction, resulting in minimal disruption for trams, pedestrians and traders along Swanston Street during construction. =Further network expansion= In 2012, Public Transport Victoria, the body charged with planning and coordination of public transport services in Victoria, released the Metropolitan Network Development Plan. It emphasised the need for the project as a precursor for other heavy rail expansion projects, given current limitations on existing inner city infrastructure to cope with additional services running into the inner part of the network. In particular rail lines to Doncaster, Melbourne Airport and Rowville require additional inner core capacity to enable services to run on those lines into the CBD. =Jobs= The project is expected to employ up to 3,500 people during peak construction. The training program called MetroHub provides all training, recruitment and project inductions for people working on the Tunnel and Stations work package. 500 apprentices, trainees and engineering cadets are expected to be a part of this program. =South Yarra station= The current scope of the project has ruled out integration with South Yarra station, meaning it will be bypassed by trains using the new tunnel. This shall render it not possible for passengers from the city on the tunnel's Dandenong line to transfer to the Frankston and Sandringham lines at South Yarra. And passengers travelling towards the city on the Dandenong line will be required to change at Caulfield to pursue travel to South Yarra. Pressure from the State Opposition and the Greens to include the station in the tunnel's design have gone unheeded. The Melbourne Metro Rail Authority has defended the plan, saying the economic case for integration is poor, requiring the building of a new hub and the acquisition of 114 properties including part of The Jam Factory at a cost of an extra $1 billion; a business case estimate indicates a return of only 20c for every dollar spent on the station. Integration of South Yarra station into the project has been the subject of lobbying as a requirement for federal funding. =Cost and funding= A significant point of contention has been the relative cost of the project and the capacity of the State to afford up to $11 billion. The former Abbott Federal Government has specifically ruled out funding urban rail projects across the country, limiting funding options for the Melbourne Metro project and placing pressure on the State Government to fund the project with a mix of debt and private business investment. While funding allocated by the Abbott Government for the now-scrapped East West Link was specifically ruled out for use on urban rail projects in Melbourne, the former Turnbull government had removed this condition. Federal funding options for the project were realised by the former Abbott Government's 'Asset Recycling Program', which matches 15% of the cost of any State Government asset that is sold to be used for infrastructure projects. The sale of the Port of Melbourne by the Andrews Government could provide additional funding to the Melbourne Metro project once sold, including an indirect contribution by the Federal Government.

History The band, originally named Breast Secreting Cake, formed in Auckland around 1991 around the nucleus of Edmund Cake, Geoff Maddock and Joel Wilton. Edmund, Geoff and Joel had played together on songs while they were at school, but the first line up to gig and release music included Dave Neilsen. The band's first recordings were made by Ed on four tracks and Ed and Dave at a 16-track studio the band was lent. A few of these songs were being played on local college radio station bFM by 1994 and the band had found an audience. They played live irregularly, and mostly with a completely different set of songs from the previous show. Often they played in costumes that made them appear as monks. At the request of Flying Nun Records' parent company Mushroom Records, the band changed its name to Bressa Creeting Cake and McWilliams, Maddock and Wilton each took on a part of that name as their own stage name.Shute, Gareth. NZ Rock, 1987 ‚Äì 2007. Random House New Zealand, Auckland, 2008 By the time the band recorded its first EP and album in 1996/7 Dave Neilsen had left and they had played live for a time with Jared Johansen and Rachael King on the bass. but the record was made by the original three members only. The music for this album was mostly recorded at a studio at Cheltenham Beach on Auckland's North Shore owned by Joe Gubay, a musician and fastidious collector of vintage audio equipment.

It was first released in the United Kingdom for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum in 1986. It was later re-released in Germany and Italy for the Commodore 64 in 1989. The game is based on the television series of the same name and follows the two central characters, James \\"Sonny\\" Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs, as they attempt to derail a Miami drug ring which is led by series antagonist \\"Mr J\\". The game was published by Ocean Software, who were renowned for developing video games related to their respective films and television shows. The main objective of the game is to apprehend criminals throughout the streets of Miami, which is accomplished by driving to various locations around the city. Miami Vice received mixed reviews upon release; the game was mainly criticised due to its poor mechanics and graphics, though some reviewers praised the overall experience. Gameplay Crockett and Tubbs may use their car in order to proceed to various destinations throughout Miami. The game is presented in a top-down perspective with elements of 2D side- scrolling gameplay. The main objective of the game is to derail various shipments of drugs controlled by the Miami Vice series antagonist, Mr J. The player assumes control of series protagonists James \\"Sonny\\" Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs, in which they must eliminate gangsters throughout Miami. To accomplish this end, Crockett and Tubbs can drive their car through the streets of Miami in order to get to various destinations, such as City Hall, Vines Bar, State Hotel, Shark Club, Joes Bar, Flag Hotel, Grand Casino, Palm Club, Murk Club, Ocean Warehouse, Acme Warehouse and Sierra Hotel, quicker. If the player collides into a wall or another car whilst driving, a small explosion will occur and a life will be deducted. At a labelled building, the player can get out of the car and enter, though enemies will only appear during certain times of the day. If the player arrives too early, the enemy gangsters will attempt to escape. If the player arrives too late, the building will be found vacant. A timetable of all meetings are included in the game's instruction manual. The aesthetic interior of buildings include two rooms, with limited decorations such as a pool table and chairs. Some buildings contain evidence bags which can be collected for extra points. Once the player comes into contact with an enemy, a separate window will appear which will display his name. The player can apprehend him by either catching or trapping him. Once caught, the player may take him to the city hall to interrogate him in order to receive information such as the location of the next gangster meetup. Points are gained by apprehending criminals, returning evidence bags or destroying cars. Development Ocean Software was founded in Manchester by David Ward and Jon Woods in 1984. The company were known for developing titles such as Platoon, Top Gun and Jurassic Park, which were usually based on the films of the same name. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ocean primarily focused on developing games related to best-selling B-movies or porting other commercially successful games onto different platforms. Miami Vice bears a resemblance to Namco's 1980 arcade game Rally X, with which it shares similar gameplay elements and mechanics.Miami Vice (1986) OCEAN, El Mundo del Spectrum In 1996, the company was purchased by French holding company Infogrames for ¬£100 million and was later merged into Atari, in 2004. In 2004, both founders of Ocean Software received the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association Hall of Fame award, for their recognition in \\"transforming\\" the British video games industry into a multi- national business. Reception The game received mixed to negative reviews upon release. Pete Shaw of Your Sinclair praised the overall experience of the game, including the \\"fast paced\\" gameplay and lack of an intrusive plot, however he criticised the \\"terrible\\" attribute clash issues in the 'Frankie goes to Florida' mode, in which he states that the mode causes graphical errors. Three reviewers of Zzap!64 stated that the graphics were \\"simplistic\\", but found them to be crisp and colourful. Chris Bourne of Crash, however, criticised the graphics as \\"dodgy\\" and \\"drab\\". Jim Lloyd of Computer and Video Games praised the music and its ability to change once the player moves from a car to building, however theorised that the game would sell due to \\"its name\\". Bourne criticised the game's lack of music for the Amstrad port and limited range of sound effects. Miami Vice received particular criticism at the difficulty of manoeuvring the car. Edward Drury of Computer Gamer, though finding the game to be enjoyable at times, stated that his only dislike was the manoeuvrability of the car, remarking that the game \\"gets boring\\" due to the amount of collisions. Bourne was highly critical of the mechanics of the car, finding it to be \\"ludicrous\\" and taking \\"at least half an hour to get used to\\". He concluded that the game was \\"very bad\\". Jim Lloyd of Computer and Video Games and a reviewer of Zzap!64 concurred that the controlling the car was a major issue.

It is the story of a young high school student as she descends into despair brought on by betrayal and bullying, culminating with her suicide. She details the thirteen reasons why she was driven to end her life in an audio diary which is mailed to a friend two weeks after her death. Thirteen Reasons Why has received recognition and awards from several young adult literary associations, and the paperback edition reached No. 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list in July 2011. A screenplay was written, based on the original release of the book, that became the basis of the dramatic television series 13 Reasons Why released through Netflix on March 31, 2017. The screenplay contains several deviations from the book, including additional characters and storylines.  Introduction  The novel was published in trade paperback format by Penguin Young Readers Group, a division of Penguin Random House on June 14, 2011. Thirteen Reasons Why had remained in hardcover long past the usual one-year release-to-paperback schedule due to its continued grassroots popularity and sales fueled by author participation. On December 27, 2016, the Tenth Anniversary Edition of Thirteen Reasons Why was published in hardcover, also by Penguin Young Readers Group. In this edition, the author's original, unpublished ending for the book is included, as well as a new introduction and an essay from the author, pages from the notebook that the author used while writing this novel, reader reactions, and a reading guide.  Characters  ;Hannah Baker: The subject of the novel. She was a female high school student who died by suicide, leaving behind recorded tapes that implicated twelve people, one of them appearing twice, as the thirteen reasons why. ;Clay Jensen: The narrator of the novel. He is a shy high school student through whom Hannah's tapes are revealed in the novel. He is the subject of the ninth tape, on which Hannah clarifies that he was always kind to her and that he does not deserve to be on her list. Clay is the only person on the tapes who is not directly blamed as a reason for Hannah's death. ;Justin Foley: The subject of the first and tenth tapes. A year older than Hannah, he was her first crush and first kiss. Hannah blames Justin on the first tape for starting rumors that she is a slut, and she blames him on the tenth tape for allowing Bryce to rape Jessica. ;Alex Standall: The subject of the second tape. After breaking up with Jessica, he published a \\"hot or not\\" list, giving Hannah the title \\"Best Ass in the Freshman Class.\\" Hannah believes this further reinforced her reputation of a slut started after her kiss with Justin. ;Jessica Davis: The subject of the third tape and a friend of Hannah's before Alex's \\"hot or not\\" list ended their friendship. Hannah blames Jessica for believing the rumors about her and telling people that Hannah stole Alex from Jessica. Jessica is later involved with Justin and raped by Bryce at a party. ;Tyler Down: The subject of the fourth tape. A classmate of Hannah's who worked as a photographer for the yearbook, Tyler allegedly stalked Hannah and took pictures of her through her bedroom window. Feeling unsafe, Hannah enlisted Courtney's help in catching the perpetrator, whom Hannah determined was Tyler based on his nervous reaction at school. ;Courtney Crimsen: The subject of the fifth tape and an acquaintance of Hannah's. Hannah describes Courtney as fake, despite being known at school as friendly. After helping Hannah catch Tyler, Courtney spreads rumors about finding sexual \\"toys\\" in Hannah's bedroom, further smearing Hannah's reputation and making her feel more alone. Courtney later accompanies Hannah to a party but leaves her after arriving. ;Marcus Cooley: The subject of the sixth tape. He once goes on a date with Hannah after matching with her through a Valentine's fundraiser. At a diner, he tries to take advantage of her and calls her a \\"tease\\" when she rejects him. Following Hannah's death, Marcus takes part in throwing rocks at Tyler's window for stalking Hannah, but refuses to take responsibility for Hannah's accusations about himself. ;Zach Dempsey: The subject of the seventh tape. After trying to comfort Hannah following her confrontation with Marcus, he turns on Hannah when she rejects him. In a shared class, Zach takes Hannah's \\"notes of encouragement\\" so that she no longer receives the anonymous support the class previously gave her. ;Ryan Shaver: The subject of the eighth tape; he was briefly friends with Hannah when the two attended an out-of- school poetry class. After gaining her trust, Ryan steals and anonymously publishes one of Hannah's poems in the school newspaper. Despite the anonymous submission, Hannah is humiliated when her poem receives criticism. ;Jenny Kurtz: The subject of the eleventh tape and a cheerleader who offers to take Hannah home from her first party.

He is the school counselor who fails to help Hannah when she admits to him that she is suicidal. ;Tony: A good-natured high school student who, though he is not on any of the tapes, receives copies of them just before Hannah's death. Though he tries to warn Hannah's parents, she kills herself, leaving Tony to watch over the people who are named as reasons for her death. He particularly looks out for Clay as he struggles through the tapes. ;Skye Miller: A female high school student and former friend of Clay's who is not named on any of the tapes.

The tapes had also been sent to several other of her classmates, instructing each of them to visit each person mentioned. As he listens to the tapes, he learns that there is a side for each person to whom Hannah attributes her reasons for killing herself. *Justin Foley started a rumor at school that Hannah was a \\"slut\\" after they kissed once in the park *Alex Standall reinforced the rumor by awarding Hannah \\"Best Ass\\" on a \\"hot or not\\" list *Alex's ex-girlfriend Jessica Davis, who had once been Hannah's friend, spread rumors that Hannah was the reason she and Alex broke up *Marcus Cooley tried to take advantage of Hannah during a date *Tyler Down stalked her and took photographs of her while spying in her window *Courtney Crimson spread stories about sexual \\"toys\\" she \\"found\\" in Hannah's room and later ditched her at a party. *Zach Dempsey made unwanted advances toward her. After she rejected him, he took away her \\"notes of encouragement\\" from the only class that she looked forward to *Ryan Shaver published one of her poems in the school paper without her knowledge, and it was harshly criticized *Jenny Kurtz crashed her car into a stop sign and chose not to report it; this event eventually led to the death of a classmate At this point, the tapes come to Clay, to whom Hannah apologizes for including because he does not deserve to be on the list; they had genuine feelings for each other, and kissed once at a party. She mentions Justin again on a second tape, saying he left Jessica lying unconscious on a bed at a party. Hannah hid in a closet and witnessed someone raping her. Hannah says on the tape that Justin knew about this and let it happen. She also says that it's 'our fault' implying that she also blames herself for letting it happen. The next person listed is Bryce Walker, who is revealed to be Jessica's rapist. Hannah was walking past a party at Bryce's. Courtney, Bryce and some of the others were in the hot tub in just their underwear. Everyone left Hannah in the hot tub by herself and then Bryce got in and started to touch Hannah. Hannah tried to resist him but he forced himself on her and raped her. The last tape is for Mr. Porter, a temporary school counselor who told Hannah that if she was unwilling to press charges against \\"the boy\\" who raped her, she should \\"try to move on\\", even after Hannah expressed a desire to kill herself. After sending the tapes to the next person on the list, Clay returns to school and runs into his classmate Skye Miller, whom he suspects is also suicidal. The novel ends with Clay reaching out to her. =Differences with the TV series= * In the book, Clay listens to all of Hannah's tapes in one night; in the TV series, he listens to them over the course of several days. * The character in the book who was Marcus Cooley became Marcus Cole in the TV series. * The character in the book who was named Jenny Kurtz became Sheri Holland in the TV series. * Mr. Porter's first name is not listed in the book, but he is named as Kevin in the TV series. * The second character to be named on the tapes in the book was Alex Standall; in the TV series it was Jessica Davis. * The ninth character to be named on the tapes in the book was Clay Jensen; in the TV series it was Justin Foley. * The tenth character to be named on the tapes in the book was Justin Foley; in the TV series it was Sheri Holland. * The eleventh character to be named on the tapes in the book was Jenny Kurtz; in the TV series it was Clay Jensen. * Neither Tony or Ryan are identified as gay in the book, and their sexualities are not explored as part of the plot. * In the book, it is revealed that Hannah kills herself via swallowing a handful of pills. However, in the television series, there is a scene of Hannah cutting her wrists. * In the book, Hannah's parents owned a shoestore. However, in the TV show, they owned a drugstore. * In the book, Courtney isn't identified as lesbian and never kisses Hannah. However, in the series, they make out in Hannah's bedroom.  Reception  Since its release, the novel has received both praise and criticism. Despite the mixed critical reviews, the novel became a bestseller after its release, holding a spot at number 16 on USA Todays list of Top 100 Books of 2017 after the release of the Netflix adaptation earlier that year. While the show's popularity increased interest in the novel, its notoriety among suicide prevention groups drew criticism of the novel's premise. After the show's release, school psychologists criticized the novel's premise for failing to address mental illness and making Hannah's death seem like the result of \\"stressors or coping challenges.\\" Another concern is how the novel's subjects of bullying and suicide impact young adult readers. Despite its proposed controversy, Festus High is one example of a school that supports the novel. According to Angela Beumer Johnson, through reading, young adults can learn about different behaviors to look for and determine what could be harmful to others. Further, educators James Chisholm and Brandie Trent argue that incorporating the novel into school curriculum can not only increase students' reading comprehension and analytic skills, but their ability to apply the themes of the novel in their own lives, as well. Other proponents of teaching the novel claim that its use in school anti-bullying efforts benefits young adult readers who are close in age to the characters; the authors encourage high schools to adopt the novel as a means of starting conversations on bullying. More generally, the novel has been hailed by adults outside the classroom as being a supplement to local initiatives in starting the conversation between parents and their children about suicide. Due to its depictions of sexual assault, in particular, another question about the novel is whether it should be given a warning label to alert readers of the content. Alev Scott takes up this question, arguing that adding a precaution at the beginning of the piece could create a negative mindset that readers will carry with them into the reading, even if they might not have initially had this mindset. Nevertheless, especially after the release of the Netflix show, critics are revisiting the novel to question whether it glorifies suicide.  Recent developments  In May 2017, the curriculum director in Mesa County School District in Colorado ordered librarians to stop circulating the book due to a rash of student suicides. After three hours of deliberation by librarians and counselors, the books were returned to circulation when it was determined that the book was not as graphic as the TV series. Notices were sent to parents within the school district alerting them to the possible influence of the series. Adaptation =Canceled film= Universal Studios purchased film rights to the novel on February 8, 2011, with Selena Gomez cast to play Hannah Baker. =Netflix series= On October 29, 2015, it was announced that Netflix would be making a television adaptation of the book with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. Tom McCarthy was hired to direct the first two episodes. The series is produced by Anonymous Content and Paramount Television with Gomez, McCarthy, Joy Gorman, Michael Sugar, Steve Golin, Mandy Teefey, and Kristel Laiblin serving as executive producers. Katherine Langford replaced Gomez for the role of Hannah Baker but left after two seasons. The series currently has four seasons extending the original plot from the novel.

Bickel was born to a well- to-do family of Columbus, Ohio who sent him to Europe for six years to prepare him for a career in architecture. On his return in 1875, he settled in Pittsburgh, apprenticed with an architect there. In 1885 he opened his independent practice, at first in partnership with J.P. Brennan, a partnership that was soon dissolved. Bickel's practice at its height averaged $3,000,000 a year in billings and was concentrated in commercial structures.

The courthouse is the centerpiece of Georgetown and is included in the Georgetown Historic District. History Brown County was formed in 1818 and the county seat was placed in Ripley. A courthouse was started in 1821 but the county seat was moved to Bridgewater and then to Georgetown. The courthouse was constructed in 1823 and was a simple square structure made of red brick and a hipped roof. This courthouse was soon decided to be too small for the population and the county selected a plan from Hubbard Baker in March 1849. The building is a fine representation of Greek Revival architecture and was completed in 1851. Wings extending from the courthouse were added in 1914 for extra room. A fire started by an arsonist swept through the courthouse in 1977 and was determined to be started in the northern stairwell and the judge's chambers. Nobody has ever been accused or convicted of the crime. The county was placed with the decision to tear down the burnt husk and start anew or to repair the structure. After a vote, the county decided to repair the structure to its pre-fire condition. Local citizens banded together to form the Brown County Courthouse Reconstruction Association to help repair the building. The courthouse was re-dedicated in 1982 to much ceremony. Exterior The courthouse is built of bricks painted white with blue window and door trim. The windows are shuttered on both levels; a balcony is attached above the door and is accessed by a set of French Doors. The entrance from the square is recessed and is framed by two large Doric columns, Doric pilasters are found along the buildings walls. The roof aboves the entrance resembles a pediment but is actually a gable. The two wings also contain entrances but the door is not recessed like the main entrance. Two stacked rectangular drums protrude from the center of the building with an octagon drum supporting the dome. A four faced clock protrudes from the sides of the final drum. Grounds The courthouse rests in a town square bounded by Grant Street, Apple Street, Cherry Street, and Main Street. The site in front of the courthouse saw Morgan's Raiders enter town in 1863. The band gathered in front of the courthouse and hitched their horses for their short stay. There was no skirmish but a soldier on leave was shot and several horses and valuables went missing.

She resides in the north (Vendidad. 7:2), where the Zoroastrian hell lies. Nasu takes the form of a fly, and is the manifestation of the decay and contamination of corpses (nasa) (Bundahishn. 28:29). When a death occurs, Nasu inhabits the corpse and acts as a catalyst for its decomposition. Nasu appears in various texts within the Avesta, notably the Vendidad, as the Vendidad gives particular focus to demons, purification rituals, and the disposal of corpses and other dead matter. Nasu is commonly considered ‚Äúthe greatest polluter of Ahura Mazda‚Äôs world.‚Äù Belief in Nasu has greatly influenced Zoroastrian funeral rites and burial ceremonies, as well as the general disdain for corpse matter that is harbored within Zoroastrian practitioners.  Etymology  Druj, meaning ‚Äúdemoness,‚Äù is commonly used as a prefix for Nasu and other female daevas. Druj is a feminine Avestan language word meaning ‚Äúfalsehood,‚Äù the opposition of asha, or ‚Äútruth.‚Äù Druj is the root for the adjective dr…ôguua·πát, meaning ‚Äúowner of falsehood,‚Äù which ‚Äú[designates] all beings who choose druj over asha.\\" Druj is used in various texts of the Avesta, with varying meanings. Depending upon the context, druj may refer to specific demons, or as a general term for that which is false, immoral, or unclean. The Avestan words nasu and nasa refer to corpses, or other solid dead matter such as nails and hair. Therefore, Nasu‚Äôs name literally means ‚Äúcorpse matter.‚Äù  In the Vendidad  = Contamination of the dead = Directly after death, as soon as the soul has left a corpse, ‚Äúthe druj Nasu rushes upon‚Äù the body, ‚Äúin the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, droning without end‚Äù (Vd. 7:2). As soon as Nasu takes hold of a corpse, the body instantly becomes contaminated. If one comes into contact with a corpse, Nasu will emerge from the body and infect them, rendering them ‚Äúunclean ‚Ä¶ for ever and ever‚Äù (Vd. 3:14). Nasu continues to inhabit the corpse until the sagdƒ´d ritual is performed, during which a dog must look at the corpse, or until a carrion- eating bird or dog consumes the body, which causes her to return to her home in the north (Vd. 7:3). = Contamination of the living = Besides contaminating corpses upon death, Nasu also contaminates those who interact with corpse-matter in specific ways. In Vendidad 3:14, Ahura Mazda explains to the prophet Zoroaster that one must never carry a corpse on their own, lest Nasu‚Äôs infection transfers to them. If one carries a corpse alone, Nasu emerges ‚Äúfrom the nose ‚Ä¶ , the eye, the tongue, the sexual organs, and the hinder parts‚Äù of the deceased, and ‚Äúrushes upon [the corpse bearer] ‚Ä¶ [and stains him] even to the end of the nails, and he is unclean, thenceforth, forever and ever‚Äù (Vd. 3:14). In this case, there is no way to purify the infected individual. In order to avoid the spread of contamination, he must live in an enclosure where ‚Äúthe ground is the cleanest and the dryest and the least passed through by flocks and herds, by the fire of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated bundles of Baresma, and by the faithful‚Äù (Vd. 3:15). There, other Zoroastrians must provide him with ‚Äúthe coarsest food‚Äù and ‚Äúthe most worn-out clothes,‚Äù until he ages into an old man (hana) (Vd. 3:18-19). Once he is elderly, the infected must be beheaded, and his corpse is offered to the vultures. At this point, ‚Äúhe is absolved by his repentance‚Äù (Vd. 3:20-21). Nasu also attacks humans who consume the corpse of a dog or human, or those who put a corpse in water or fire. These individuals are considered unclean forever, with no option of repentance (Vd. 7:23-26). Nasu will also attack humans and dogs who are nearby a person at the time of their death (Vd. 5:27). = Purification = In some cases, a living individual who has been defiled by Nasu has a chance at regaining purity, if the proper purification rites are performed (Vd. 9:42). However, if the ritual is performed by an unqualified purifier, Nasu will grow stronger, and the contamination will heighten (Vd. 9:48). In fargard 10 of the Vendidad, Ahura Mazda recommends recitation of certain verses from the Gathas to ‚Äúfight against‚Äù Nasu and purify a contaminated individual (Vd. 10:1-12). Some verses must be recited twice (Yasna. 28:2, 35:2, 35:8, 39:4, 41:3, 41:5, 43:1, 47:1, 51:1, 53:1), thrice (Y. 27:14, 33:11, 35:5, 53:9), or four times (Y. 27:13, 34:15, 54:1). The Sros baj, or ‚Äúutterance against pollution,‚Äù an important daily recitation in honor of Sraosha, ‚Äúis a powerful prophylactic prayer that protects one against decay and death.‚Äù = Offspring = In fargard 18 of the Vendidad, Sraosha has a dialogue with Nasu. While striking Nasu, he asks her if she bears offspring without copulating with a man (Vd. 18:30). To this, Nasu responds that she is impregnated whenever practitioners of Zoroastrianism are greedy (Vd. 18:34), ‚Äúemit seed‚Äù during sleep (Vd. 18:46), spill water (Vd. 18:40), or if they ‚Äú[walk] without wearing the sacred girdle and the sacred shirt‚Äù (Vd. 18:54). Conversely, ‚Äúthe fruit of [her] womb‚Äù is destroyed every time one is generous to another Zoroastrian, or recites the Ahuna Vairya after emitting seed or spilling water.  Funeral rites and burial ceremonies  Tower of Silence near Yazd, Iran. The structure is no longer in use. The belief that bodies are infested by Nasu upon death greatly influenced Zoroastrian burial ceremonies and funeral rites. Burial and cremation of corpses was prohibited, as such acts would defile the sacred creations of earth and fire respectively (Vd. 7:25). Burial of corpses was so looked down upon that the exhumation of ‚Äúburied corpses was regarded as meritorious.‚Äù For these reasons, ‚ÄúTowers of Silence‚Äù were developed‚Äîopen air, amphitheater like structures in which corpses were placed so carrion-eating birds could feed on them. Sagdƒ´d, meaning ‚Äúseen by a dog,‚Äù is a ritual that must be performed as promptly after death as possible. The dog is able to calculate the degree of evil within the corpse, and entraps the contamination so it may not spread further, expelling Nasu from the body (Denkard. 31). Nasu remains within the corpse until it has been seen by a dog, or until it has been consumed by a dog or a carrion-eating bird (Vd. 7:3). According to chapter 31 of the Denkard, the reasoning for the required consumption of corpses is that the evil influences of Nasu are contained within the corpse until, upon being digested, the body is changed from the form of nasa into nourishment for animals. The corpse is thereby delivered over to the animals, changing from the state of corrupted nasa to that of hixr, which is ‚Äúdry dead matter,‚Äù considered to be less polluting. A path through which a funeral procession has traveled must not be passed again, as Nasu haunts the area thereafter, until the proper rites of banishment are performed (Vd. 8:15). Nasu is expelled from the area only after ‚Äúa yellow dog with four eyes, or a white dog with yellow ears‚Äù is walked through the path three times (Vd. 8:16). If the dog goes unwillingly down the path, it must be walked back and forth up to nine times to ensure that Nasu has been driven off (Vd. 8:17-18).  In popular culture  Nasu appears as a villain in eight games from the Megami Tensei video game franchise: Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei, Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II, Ky≈´yaku Megami Tensei, Shin Megami Tensei: if‚Ä¶, Last Bible III, Ronde, Giten Megami Tensei: Tokyo Mokushiroku, and Revelations: Persona. In these games, she is either referred to as Druj („Éâ„Ç•„É´„Ç∏, Duruji), Nasu („Éä„Éº„Çπ, NƒÅsu), or Nasu Fly („Éä„Éº„ÇπËùø, NƒÅsu Hae). In Shin Megami Tensei: if‚Ä¶ Nasu is a boss, while she appears as lesser demons in the other games. Nasu is a card in four battle RPG smartphone games for Android and IOS: Age of Ishtaria, Guardian Cross, Legend of the Cryptids, and Blood Brothers. In each of these games, she is called Druj Nasu.

For instance, the unit cells of the first NIMs were stacked horizontally and vertically, resulting in a pattern that was repeated and intended (see below images). Specifications for the response of each unit cell are predetermined prior to construction and are based on the intended response of the entire, newly constructed, material. In other words, each cell is individually tuned to respond in a certain way, based on the desired output of the NIM. The aggregate response is mainly determined by each unit cell's geometry and substantially differs from the response of its constituent materials. In other words, the way the NIM responds is that of a new material, unlike the wires or metals and dielectrics it is made from. Hence, the NIM has become an effective medium. Also, in effect, this metamaterial has become an ‚Äúordered macroscopic material, synthesized from the bottom up‚Äù, and has emergent properties beyond its components.Sihvola, A. (2002) \\"Electromagnetic Emergence in Metamaterials: Deconstruction of terminology of complex media\\", pp. 3‚Äì18 in Advances in Electromagnetics of Complex Media and Metamaterials. Zouhdi, Sa√Ød; Sihvola, Ari and Arsalane, Mohamed (eds.). Kluwer Academic. . Metamaterials that exhibit a negative value for the refractive index are often referred to by any of several terminologies: left-handed media or left-handed material (LHM), backward-wave media (BW media), media with negative refractive index, double negative (DNG) metamaterials, and other similar names.In the literature, most widely used designations are \\"double negative\\" and \\"left-handed\\". Properties and characteristics A split-ring resonator array arranged to produce a negative index of refraction, constructed of copper split-ring resonators and wires mounted on interlocking sheets of fiberglass circuit board. The total array consists of 3 by 20√ó20 unit cells with overall dimensions of 10√ó100√ó100 millimeters. The height of 10 millimeters measures a little more than six subdivision marks on the ruler, which is marked in inches. Electrodynamics of media with negative indices of refraction were first studied by Russian theoretical-physicist Victor Veselago from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 1967. The proposed left-handed or negative-index materials were theorized to exhibit optical properties opposite to those of glass, air, and other transparent media. Such materials were predicted to exhibit counterintuitive properties like bending or refracting light in unusual and unexpected ways. However, the first practical metamaterial was not constructed until 33 years later and it does produce Veselago's concepts. In 1978, Sergei P. Efimov from Bauman Moscow State Technical University found unexpected effect in theory of the wave refraction. His research is based on fundamental property of Maxwell's equations to overcome restrictions of Fresnel equations. He found parameters of totally non-reflecting crystal i.e. of anisotropic medium. Found property is important for developing concepts of metamaterials. *See full text here Currently, negative-index metamaterials are being developed to manipulate electromagnetic radiation in new ways. For example, optical and electromagnetic properties of natural materials are often altered through chemistry. With metamaterials, optical and electromagnetic properties can be engineered by changing the geometry of its unit cells. The unit cells are materials that are ordered in geometric arrangements with dimensions that are fractions of the wavelength of the radiated electromagnetic wave. Each artificial unit responds to the radiation from the source. The collective result is the material's response to the electromagnetic wave that is broader than normal. Subsequently, transmission is altered by adjusting the shape, size, and configurations of the unit cells. This results in control over material parameters known as permittivity and magnetic permeability. These two parameters (or quantities) determine the propagation of electromagnetic waves in matter. Therefore, controlling the values of permittivity and permeability means that the refractive index can be negative or zero as well as conventionally positive. It all depends on the intended application or desired result. So, optical properties can be expanded beyond the capabilities of lenses, mirrors, and other conventional materials. Additionally, one of the effects most studied is the negative index of refraction. =Reverse propagation= When a negative index of refraction occurs, propagation of the electromagnetic wave is reversed. Resolution below the diffraction limit becomes possible. This is known as subwavelength imaging. Transmitting a beam of light via an electromagnetically flat surface is another capability. In contrast, conventional materials are usually curved, and cannot achieve resolution below the diffraction limit. Also, reversing the electromagnetic waves in a material, in conjunction with other ordinary materials (including air) could result in minimizing losses that would normally occur. The reverse of the electromagnetic wave, characterized by an antiparallel phase velocity is also an indicator of negative index of refraction. Furthermore, negative-index materials are customized composites. In other words, materials are combined with a desired result in mind. Combinations of materials can be designed to achieve optical properties not seen in nature. The properties of the composite material stem from its lattice structure constructed from components smaller than the impinging electromagnetic wavelength separated by distances that are also smaller than the impinging electromagnetic wavelength. Likewise, by fabricating such metamaterials researchers are trying to overcome fundamental limits tied to the wavelength of light. The unusual and counter intuitive properties currently have practical and commercial use manipulating electromagnetic microwaves in wireless and communication systems. Lastly, research continues in the other domains of the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light. A strategy for increasing operational bandwidth to achieve negative index: Materials The first actual metamaterials worked in the microwave regime, or centimeter wavelengths, of the electromagnetic spectrum (about 4.3 GHz). It was constructed of split-ring resonators and conducting straight wires (as unit cells). The unit cells were sized from 7 to 10 millimeters. The unit cells were arranged in a two-dimensional (periodic) repeating pattern which produces a crystal-like geometry. Both the unit cells and the lattice spacing were smaller than the radiated electromagnetic wave. This produced the first left-handed material when both the permittivity and permeability of the material were negative. This system relies on the resonant behavior of the unit cells. Below a group of researchers develop an idea for a left-handed metamaterial that does not rely on such resonant behavior. Research in the microwave range continues with split-ring resonators and conducting wires. Research also continues in the shorter wavelengths with this configuration of materials and the unit cell sizes are scaled down. However, at around 200 terahertz issues arise which make using the split ring resonator problematic. \\"Alternative materials become more suitable for the terahertz and optical regimes.\\" At these wavelengths selection of materials and size limitations become important. For example, in 2007 a 100 nanometer mesh wire design made of silver and woven in a repeating pattern transmitted beams at the 780 nanometer wavelength, the far end of the visible spectrum. The researchers believe this produced a negative refraction of 0.6. Nevertheless, this operates at only a single wavelength like its predecessor metamaterials in the microwave regime. Hence, the challenges are to fabricate metamaterials so that they \\"refract light at ever-smaller wavelengths\\" and to develop broad band capabilities. =Artificial transmission-line-media= 500px In the metamaterial literature, medium or media refers to transmission medium or optical medium. In 2002, a group of researchers came up with the idea that in contrast to materials that depended on resonant behavior, non-resonant phenomena could surpass narrow bandwidth constraints of the wire/split-ring resonator configuration. This idea translated into a type of medium with broader bandwidth abilities, negative refraction, backward waves, and focusing beyond the diffraction limit. They dispensed with split-ring-resonators and instead used a network of L‚ÄìC loaded transmission lines. metamaterial literature this became known as artificial transmission-line media. At that time it had the added advantage of being more compact than a unit made of wires and split ring resonators. The network was both scalable (from the megahertz to the tens of gigahertz range) and tunable. It also includes a method for focusing the wavelengths of interest. By 2007 the negative refractive index transmission line was employed as a subwavelength focusing free-space flat lens. That this is a free-space lens is a significant advance. Part of prior research efforts targeted creating a lens that did not need to be embedded in a transmission line. =The optical domain= Metamaterial components shrink as research explores shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) of the electromagnetic spectrum in the infrared and visible spectrums. For example, theory and experiment have investigated smaller horseshoe shaped split ring resonators designed with lithographic techniques, See p. 1944 and p. 1947 in as well as paired metal nanorods or nanostrips, and nanoparticles as circuits designed with lumped element models of this research by Nader Engheta (PDF format). Applications The science of negative-index materials is being matched with conventional devices that broadcast, transmit, shape, or receive electromagnetic signals that travel over cables, wires, or air. The materials, devices and systems that are involved with this work could have their properties altered or heightened. Hence, this is already happening with metamaterial antennasSlyusar V.I. Metamaterials on antenna solutions.// 7th International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques ICATT‚Äô09, Lviv, Ukraine, October 6‚Äì9, 2009. - Pp. 19 - 24 and related devices which are commercially available. Moreover, in the wireless domain these metamaterial apparatuses continue to be researched. Other applications are also being researched. These are electromagnetic absorbers such as radar-microwave absorbers, electrically small resonators, waveguides that can go beyond the diffraction limit, phase compensators, advancements in focusing devices (e.g. microwave lens), and improved electrically small antennas. In the optical frequency regime developing the superlens may allow for imaging below the diffraction limit. Other potential applications for negative-index metamaterials are optical nanolithography, nanotechnology circuitry, as well as a near field superlens (Pendry, 2000) that could be useful for biomedical imaging and subwavelength photolithography. Manipulating permittivity and permeability Refraction of light at the interface between two media of different refractive indices, with n2 > n1. Since the velocity is lower in the second medium (v2 < v1), the angle of refraction Œ∏2 is less than the angle of incidence Œ∏1; that is, the ray in the higher-index medium is closer to the normal. To describe any electromagnetic properties of a given achiral material such as an optical lens, there are two significant parameters. These are permittivity, \\\\epsilon_r, and permeability, \\\\mu_r, which allow accurate prediction of light waves traveling within materials, and electromagnetic phenomena that occur at the interface between two materials. For example, refraction is an electromagnetic phenomenon which occurs at the interface between two materials. Snell's law states that the relationship between the angle of incidence of a beam of electromagnetic radiation (light) and the resulting angle of refraction rests on the refractive indices, n, of the two media (materials). The refractive index of an achiral medium is given by \\\\scriptstyle n =\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_r\\\\mu_r}. Hence, it can be seen that the refractive index is dependent on these two parameters. Therefore, if designed or arbitrarily modified values can be inputs for \\\\epsilon_r and \\\\mu_r, then the behavior of propagating electromagnetic waves inside the material can be manipulated at will. This ability then allows for intentional determination of the refractive index. Video representing negative refraction of light at uniform planar interface. For example, in 1967, Victor Veselago analytically determined that light will refract in the reverse direction (negatively) at the interface between a material with negative refractive index and a material exhibiting conventional positive refractive index. This extraordinary material was realized on paper with simultaneous negative values for \\\\epsilon_r, and, \\\\mu_r, and could therefore be termed a double negative material. However, in Veselago's day a material which exhibits double negative parameters simultaneously seemed impossible because no natural materials exist which can produce this effect. Therefore, his work was ignored for three decades.. It was nominated for the Nobel Prize later. In 1987, Sergei P. Efimov used fundamental property of Maxwell's equations to overcome restrictions of Fresnel formulas. He changed scale of Z-axis: Z'=Z/K, i.e. empty medium with Œµ=1 is compressed along Z. Therefore, Maxwell's equations go to equations for macroscopic anisotropic medium with tensors Œµ and Œº. Permittivity Œµz along axis Z is equal to K when transverse Œµtr is equal to 1/K. Permeability Œºz is equal to K and transverse that Œºtr is equal to 1/K. Wave in empty space goes to refracted wave. Consequently, found crystal has no reflection at any angle and for any frequency. Straight calculation gives the reflection coefficient to be equal to zero what is similar to \\"quantum effect\\". It is very important that parameter K can be negative and complex even as far as the origin of effect is the \\"compression\\" property only. Sergei P. Efimov applied analogous transformation for the acoustic wave equations. Three conceptions- negative- index medium, non-reflective crystal and super-lense are foundations of the metamaterial theory. Bowers J. A.;Hyde R. A.;Jung K. Y.\\"Negative-refractive focusing and sensing apparatus, methods and systems\\" Issue date 2015-04-28 Bowers J. A.; Hyde R. A.; Yung E. K. \\"Evanescent electromagnetic wave conversion lenses. I\\" Issue date 2015-07-14. In general the physical properties of natural materials cause limitations. Most dielectrics only have positive permittivities, \\\\epsilon_r > 0. Metals will exhibit negative permittivity, \\\\epsilon_r < 0 at optical frequencies, and plasmas exhibit negative permittivity values in certain frequency bands. Pendry et al. demonstrated that the plasma frequency can be made to occur in the lower microwave frequencies for metals with a material made of metal rods that replaces the bulk metal. However, in each of these cases permeability remains always positive. At microwave frequencies it is possible for negative Œº to occur in some ferromagnetic materials. But the inherent drawback is they are difficult to find above terahertz frequencies. In any case, a natural material that can achieve negative values for permittivity and permeability simultaneously has not been found or discovered. Hence, all of this has led to constructing artificial composite materials known as metamaterials in order to achieve the desired results. Negative index of refraction due to chirality In case of chiral materials, the refractive index n depends not only on permittivity \\\\epsilon_r and permeability \\\\mu_r, but also on the chirality parameter \\\\kappa, resulting in distinct values for left and right circularly polarized waves, given by :n = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_r\\\\mu_r} \\\\pm \\\\kappa A negative index will occur for waves of one circular polarization if \\\\kappa > \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_r\\\\mu_r}. In this case, it is not necessary that either or both \\\\epsilon_r and \\\\mu_r be negative to achieve a negative index of refraction. A negative refractive index due to chirality was predicted by Pendry and Tretyakov et al., and first observed simultaneously and independently by Plum et al. and Zhang et al. in 2009. Physical properties never before produced in nature Theoretical articles were published in 1996 and 1999 which showed that synthetic materials could be constructed to purposely exhibit a negative permittivity and permeability.Negative permitivitty was explored in group of research papers which included: * Effective permeablitiy with large positive and negative values was explored in the following research:  These papers, along with Veselago's 1967 theoretical analysis of the properties of negative-index materials, provided the background to fabricate a metamaterial with negative effective permittivity and permeability. See below. A metamaterial developed to exhibit negative-index behavior is typically formed from individual components. Each component responds differently and independently to a radiated electromagnetic wave as it travels through the material. Since these components are smaller than the radiated wavelength it is understood that a macroscopic view includes an effective value for both permittivity and permeability. =Composite material= In the year 2000, David R. Smith's team of UCSD researchers produced a new class of composite materials by depositing a structure onto a circuit-board substrate consisting of a series of thin copper split-rings and ordinary wire segments strung parallel to the rings. This material exhibited unusual physical properties that had never been observed in nature. These materials obey the laws of physics, but behave differently from normal materials. In essence these negative-index metamaterials were noted for having the ability to reverse many of the physical properties that govern the behavior of ordinary optical materials. One of those unusual properties is the ability to reverse, for the first time, Snell's law of refraction. Until the demonstration of negative refractive index for microwaves by the UCSD team, the material had been unavailable. Advances during the 1990s in fabrication and computation abilities allowed these first metamaterials to be constructed. Thus, the \\"new\\" metamaterial was tested for the effects described by Victor Veselago 30 years earlier. Studies of this experiment, which followed shortly thereafter, announced that other effects had occurred. With antiferromagnets and certain types of insulating ferromagnets, effective negative magnetic permeability is achievable when polariton resonance exists. To achieve a negative index of refraction, however, permittivity with negative values must occur within the same frequency range. The artificially fabricated split-ring resonator is a design that accomplishes this, along with the promise of dampening high losses. With this first introduction of the metamaterial, it appears that the losses incurred were smaller than antiferromagnetic, or ferromagnetic materials. When first demonstrated in 2000, the composite material (NIM) was limited to transmitting microwave radiation at frequencies of 4 to 7 gigahertz (4.28‚Äì7.49 cm wavelengths). This range is between the frequency of household microwave ovens (~2.45 GHz, 12.23 cm) and military radars (~10 GHz, 3 cm). At demonstrated frequencies, pulses of electromagnetic radiation moving through the material in one direction are composed of constituent waves moving in the opposite direction. The metamaterial was constructed as a periodic array of copper split ring and wire conducting elements deposited onto a circuit-board substrate. The design was such that the cells, and the lattice spacing between the cells, were much smaller than the radiated electromagnetic wavelength. Hence, it behaves as an effective medium. The material has become notable because its range of (effective) permittivity Œµeff and permeability Œºeff values have exceeded those found in any ordinary material. Furthermore, the characteristic of negative (effective) permeability evinced by this medium is particularly notable, because it has not been found in ordinary materials. In addition, the negative values for the magnetic component is directly related to its left-handed nomenclature, and properties (discussed in a section below). The split-ring resonator (SRR), based on the prior 1999 theoretical article, is the tool employed to achieve negative permeability. This first composite metamaterial is then composed of split-ring resonators and electrical conducting posts. Initially, these materials were only demonstrated at wavelengths longer than those in the visible spectrum. In addition, early NIMs were fabricated from opaque materials and usually made of non-magnetic constituents. As an illustration, however, if these materials are constructed at visible frequencies, and a flashlight is shone onto the resulting NIM slab, the material should focus the light at a point on the other side. This is not possible with a sheet of ordinary opaque material. In 2007, the NIST in collaboration with the Atwater Lab at Caltech created the first NIM active at optical frequencies. More recently (), layered \\"fishnet\\" NIM materials made of silicon and silver wires have been integrated into optical fibers to create active optical elements. =Simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability= Negative permittivity Œµeff < 0 had already been discovered and realized in metals for frequencies all the way up to the plasma frequency, before the first metamaterial. There are two requirements to achieve a negative value for refraction. First, is to fabricate a material which can produce negative permeability Œºeff < 0\\\\. Second, negative values for both permittivity and permeability must occur simultaneously over a common range of frequencies. Therefore, for the first metamaterial, the nuts and bolts are one split-ring resonator electromagnetically combined with one (electric) conducting post. These are designed to resonate at designated frequencies to achieve the desired values. Looking at the make-up of the split ring, the associated magnetic field pattern from the SRR is dipolar. This dipolar behavior is notable because this means it mimics nature's atom, but on a much larger scale, such as in this case at 2.5 millimeters. Atoms exist on the scale of picometers. The splits in the rings create a dynamic where the SRR unit cell can be made resonant at radiated wavelengths much larger than the diameter of the rings. If the rings were closed, a half wavelength boundary would be electromagnetically imposed as a requirement for resonance. The split in the second ring is oriented opposite to the split in the first ring. It is there to generate a large capacitance, which occurs in the small gap. This capacitance substantially decreases the resonant frequency while concentrating the electric field. The individual SRR depicted on the right had a resonant frequency of 4.845 GHz, and the resonance curve, inset in the graph, is also shown. The radiative losses from absorption and reflection are noted to be small, because the unit dimensions are much smaller than the free space, radiated wavelength. When these units or cells are combined into a periodic arrangement, the magnetic coupling between the resonators is strengthened, and a strong magnetic coupling occurs. Properties unique in comparison to ordinary or conventional materials begin to emerge. For one thing, this periodic strong coupling creates a material, which now has an effective magnetic permeability Œºeff in response to the radiated-incident magnetic field. =Composite material passband= Graphing the general dispersion curve, a region of propagation occurs from zero up to a lower band edge, followed by a gap, and then an upper passband. The presence of a 400 MHz gap between 4.2 GHz and 4.6 GHz implies a band of frequencies where Œºeff < 0 occurs. (Please see the image in the previous section) Furthermore, when wires are added symmetrically between the split rings, a passband occurs within the previously forbidden band of the split ring dispersion curves. That this passband occurs within a previously forbidden region indicates that the negative Œµeff for this region has combined with the negative Œºeff to allow propagation, which fits with theoretical predictions. Mathematically, the dispersion relation leads to a band with negative group velocity everywhere, and a bandwidth that is independent of the plasma frequency, within the stated conditions. Mathematical modeling and experiment have both shown that periodically arrayed conducting elements (non-magnetic by nature) respond predominantly to the magnetic component of incident electromagnetic fields. The result is an effective medium and negative Œºeff over a band of frequencies. The permeability was verified to be the region of the forbidden band, where the gap in propagation occurred ‚Äì from a finite section of material. This was combined with a negative permittivity material, Œµeff < 0, to form a ‚Äúleft- handed‚Äù medium, which formed a propagation band with negative group velocity where previously there was only attenuation. This validated predictions. In addition, a later work determined that this first metamaterial had a range of frequencies over which the refractive index was predicted to be negative for one direction of propagation (see ref #). Other predicted electrodynamic effects were to be investigated in other research. =Describing a left-handed material= A comparison of refraction in a negative-index metamaterial to that in a conventional material having the same, but positive refractive index. The incident beam Œ∏ enters from air and refracts in a normal (Œ∏') or metamaterial (-Œ∏'). From the conclusions in the above section a left-handed material (LHM) can be defined. It is a material which exhibits simultaneous negative values for permittivity, Œµ, and permeability, Œº, in an overlapping frequency region. Since the values are derived from the effects of the composite medium system as a whole, these are defined as effective permittivity, Œµeff, and effective permeability, Œºeff. Real values are then derived to denote the value of negative index of refraction, and wave vectors. This means that in practice losses will occur for a given medium used to transmit electromagnetic radiation such as microwave, or infrared frequencies, or visible light ‚Äì for example. In this instance, real values describe either the amplitude or the intensity of a transmitted wave relative to an incident wave, while ignoring the negligible loss values. Isotropic negative index in two dimensions In the above sections first fabricated metamaterial was constructed with resonating elements, which exhibited one direction of incidence and polarization. In other words, this structure exhibited left- handed propagation in one dimension. This was discussed in relation to Veselago's seminal work 33 years earlier (1967). He predicted that intrinsic to a material, which manifests negative values of effective permittivity and permeability, are several types of reversed physics phenomena. Hence, there was then a critical need for a higher-dimensional LHMs to confirm Veselago's theory, as expected. The confirmation would include reversal of Snell's law (index of refraction), along with other reversed phenomena. In the beginning of 2001 the existence of a higher-dimensional structure was reported. It was two-dimensional and demonstrated by both experiment and numerical confirmation. It was an LHM, a composite constructed of wire strips mounted behind the split-ring resonators (SRRs) in a periodic configuration. It was created for the express purpose of being suitable for further experiments to produce the effects predicted by Veselago. Experimental verification of a negative index of refraction Split-ring resonator consisting of an inner square with a split on one side embedded in an outer square with a split on the other side. Split-ring resonators are on the front and right surfaces of the square grid, and single vertical wires are on the back and left surfaces. A theoretical work published in 1967 by Soviet physicist Victor Veselago showed that a refractive index with negative values is possible and that this does not violate the laws of physics. As discussed previously (above), the first metamaterial had a range of frequencies over which the refractive index was predicted to be negative for one direction of propagation. It was reported in May 2000. In 2001, a team of researchers constructed a prism composed of metamaterials (negative-index metamaterials) to experimentally test for negative refractive index. The experiment used a waveguide to help transmit the proper frequency and isolate the material. This test achieved its goal because it successfully verified a negative index of refraction. The experimental demonstration of negative refractive index was followed by another demonstration, in 2003, of a reversal of Snell's law, or reversed refraction. However, in this experiment negative index of refraction material is in free space from 12.6 to 13.2 GHz. Although the radiated frequency range is about the same, a notable distinction is this experiment is conducted in free space rather than employing waveguides. Furthering the authenticity of negative refraction, the power flow of a wave transmitted through a dispersive left-handed material was calculated and compared to a dispersive right-handed material. The transmission of an incident field, composed of many frequencies, from an isotropic nondispersive material into an isotropic dispersive media is employed. The direction of power flow for both nondispersive and dispersive media is determined by the time-averaged Poynting vector. Negative refraction was shown to be possible for multiple frequency signals by explicit calculation of the Poynting vector in the LHM. =Fundamental electromagnetic properties of the NIM= In a slab of conventional material with an ordinary refractive index ‚Äì a right-handed material (RHM) ‚Äì the wave front is transmitted away from the source. In a NIM the wavefront travels toward the source. However, the magnitude and direction of the flow of energy essentially remains the same in both the ordinary material and the NIM. Since the flow of energy remains the same in both materials (media), the impedance of the NIM matches the RHM. Hence, the sign of the intrinsic impedance is still positive in a NIM. Light incident on a left-handed material, or NIM, will bend to the same side as the incident beam, and for Snell's law to hold, the refraction angle should be negative. In a passive metamaterial medium this determines a negative real and imaginary part of the refractive index. =Negative refractive index in left-handed materials= The left-handed orientation is shown on the left, and the right-handed on the right. In 1968 Victor Veselago's paper showed that the opposite directions of EM plane waves and the flow of energy was derived from the individual Maxwell curl equations. In ordinary optical materials, the curl equation for the electric field show a \\"right hand rule\\" for the directions of the electric field E, the magnetic induction B, and wave propagation, which goes in the direction of wave vector k. However, the direction of energy flow formed by E √ó H is right-handed only when permeability is greater than zero. This means that when permeability is less than zero, e.g. negative, wave propagation is reversed (determined by k), and contrary to the direction of energy flow. Furthermore, the relations of vectors E, H, and k form a \\"left-handed\\" system ‚Äì and it was Veselago who coined the term \\"left-handed\\" (LH) material, which is in wide use today (2011). He contended that an LH material has a negative refractive index and relied on the steady-state solutions of Maxwell's equations as a center for his argument. After a 30-year void, when LH materials were finally demonstrated, it could be said that the designation of negative refractive index is unique to LH systems; even when compared to photonic crystals. Photonic crystals, like many other known systems, can exhibit unusual propagation behavior such as reversal of phase and group velocities. But, negative refraction does not occur in these systems, and not yet realistically in photonic crystals. =Negative refraction at optical frequencies= The negative refractive index in the optical range was first demonstrated in 2005 by Shalaev et al. (at the telecom wavelength Œª = 1.5 Œºm) and by Brueck et al. (at Œª = 2 Œºm) at nearly the same time. , several anomalous studies have announced negative refraction at single frequencies in the visible spectrum,Caltech Media Relations. Negative Refraction of Visible Light Demonstrated; Could Lead to Cloaking Devices . March 22, 2007. accessdate ‚Äì 2010-05-05 but the results of some of these demonstrations are considered ambiguous by later studies. Experimental verification of reversed Cherenkov radiation Besides reversed values for index of refraction, Veselago predicted the occurrence of reversed Cherenkov radiation (also known simply as CR) in a left-handed medium. In 1934 Pavel Cherenkov discovered a coherent radiation that occurs when certain types of media are bombarded by fast moving electron beams. In 1937 a theory built around CR stated that when charged particles, such as electrons, travel through a medium at speeds faster than the speed of light in the medium only then will CR radiate. As the CR occurs, electromagnetic radiation is emitted in a cone shape, fanning out in the forward direction. CR and the 1937 theory has led to a large array of applications in high energy physics. A notable application are the Cherenkov counters. These are used to determine various properties of a charged particle such as its velocity, charge, direction of motion, and energy. These properties are important in the identification of different particles. For example, the counters were applied in the discovery of the antiproton and the J/œà meson. Six large Cherenkov counters were used in the discovery of the J/œà meson. It has been difficult to experimentally prove the reversed Cherenkov radiation. Other optics with NIMs Theoretical work, along with numerical simulations, began in the early 2000s on the abilities of DNG slabs for subwavelength focusing. The research began with Pendry's proposed \\"Perfect lens.\\" Several research investigations that followed Pendry's concluded that the \\"Perfect lens\\" was possible in theory but impractical. One direction in subwavelength focusing proceeded with the use of negative-index metamaterials, but based on the enhancements for imaging with surface plasmons. In another direction researchers explored paraxial approximations of NIM slabs. Implications of negative refractive materials The existence of negative refractive materials can result in a change in electrodynamic calculations for the case of permeability Œº = 1 . A change from a conventional refractive index to a negative value gives incorrect results for conventional calculations, because some properties and effects have been altered. When permeability Œº has values other than 1 this affects Snell's law, the Doppler effect, the Cherenkov radiation, Fresnel's equations, and Fermat's principle. *Alternate source at: :* paper by Victor G.

US patent on left-handed composite media The first US patent granted for a fabricated metamaterial is ', titled \\"Left handed composite media.\\" The listed inventors are David R. Smith, Sheldon Schultz, Norman Kroll, Richard A. Shelby. The invention achieves simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability over a common band of frequencies. The material can integrate media which is already composite or continuous, but which will produce negative permittivity and permeability within the same spectrum of frequencies. Different types of continuous or composite may be deemed appropriate when combined for the desired effect. However, the inclusion of a periodic array of conducting elements is preferred. The array scatters electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths longer than the size of the element and lattice spacing. The array is then viewed as an effective medium.Smith, David; Schultz, Sheldon; Kroll, Norman; Shelby, Richard A. \\"Left handed composite media\\" Publication date 2001-03-16, Issue date 2004-03-14.

Miller (1872 - 1951) was an American physician who was the first medical director of the Afro-American Hospital in Yazoo City, Mississippi, the first private hospital for blacks in the state. He was also a co-founder of the Mississippi Medical and Surgical Association. Biography Miller was born in Natchez, Mississippi on December 6, 1872, the son of Washington Miller, a hackman (or cabdriver) and his wife, Emily. One of the few African American physicians in Mississippi, he established a medical practice in Yazoo City in the late 1890s. In 1900, Dr. L. T. Miller was a co- founder with a dozen other doctors of the Mississippi Medical and Surgical Association (MMSA), the state's largest and oldest organization representing African American health professionals. In 1928, T.J. Huddleston established the Afro-American Hospital in Yazoo City to provide medical services for members of the Afro-American Sons and Daughters, a statewide fraternal insurance organization that provided death and hospitalization benefits to its members. Miller was chosen as the hospital's first medical director. While the facility's mission was primarily to service its members, it was also available to the general public on a fee for service basis. Given the dearth of quality health care facilities available to blacks at the time, the hospital serviced not only individuals from Yazoo City and the Delta region, but other parts of Mississippi and the South as well.David T. Beito and Linda Royster beito Let Down Your Bucket Where You Are':The Afro-American Hospital and Black Health Care in Mississippi, 1924-1966, Social Science History 30 (Winter 2006), 551-69. In 1933, his discovery of a lithopaedion while performing surgery to remove a tumor was reported in the media. Dr. Miller recruited Dr. Robert Elliott Fullilove and three registered nurses to complete his staff. During its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s, the facility also operated a state licensed nursing school. Dr. Miller suffered a stroke on December 17, 1950 and died on March 8, 1951. Dr. Fullilove succeeded Miller as medical director.

He attempted to understand the dharma in view of his own existence and thus derived the Nembutsu (recitation of \\"Namu Amida Butsu\\": Amitabha Buddha's name) teaching, which he emphasized as an expression of thanks and joy in realizing the interrelated nature of human existence. Established in 1933, it is the oldest Buddhist organization in Canada.Watada, Bukkyo Tozen: A History of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism in Canada 1905-1995 p. 78 The national office for the Jodo Shinshu Buddhist Temples of Canada (formerly Buddhist Churches of Canada) is located in Richmond, British Columbia. History Japanese Canadians first established Buddhism in Canada during the late 1800s as new immigrants gathered in homes. The Jodo Shinshu tradition likely resided in British Columbia as early as 1889, when the first Japanese consulate was established.The Canadian Encyclopedia The Reverend Senju Sasaki and his wife Tomie arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia on October 12, 1905, and immediately set about bringing Jodo Shinshu Buddhism to Canada. By December 12, 1905 the first Buddhist Temple in Canada was established in the city.Watada, Bukkyo Tozen: A History of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism in Canada 1905-1995 Because it was identified with a particular ethnic group, this form of Buddhism did not become integrated into the Canadian society at that time. During World War II, the internment of people of Japanese ancestry almost eradicated Japanese Buddhism and institutional Buddhism from Canada. The lifting of the War Measures Act in 1949 restored Japanese freedom of movement throughout Canada; some Japanese Buddhists returned to BC, many stayed in Alberta and others settled elsewhere. Many temples now have a multicultural population consisting of Japanese, Japanese-Canadians and non-Japanese members. Multiple temples have branched out in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Qu√©bec.

Construction was initiated shortly after Allied forces seized control of the Tavoliere plain around Foggia, Apulia, Italy. The major tenant of the airfield was the 301st Bombardment Group, which arrived from either Torretta, San Giovanni, Giulia or Stornara Airfield in the Cerignola area of Italy on 1 February 1944. It was equipped with Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . The 301st Bomb Group consisted of four squadrons: * 32d Bombardment Squadron * 352d Bombardment Squadron * 353d Bombardment Squadron * 419th Bombardment Squadron The airfield had parallel, 6,000' x 100' asphalt runways laid over Pierced Steel Planking, oriented 13/31. There were two perimeter tracks, one on each side of the runways. There may have been some temporary hangars and buildings; however, it appears that personnel were quartered primarily in tents, and most aircraft maintenance took place in the open on hardstands. It also had a steel control tower. With the end of the war in 1945, the 301st returned to the United States at the end of July, heading to Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota to become part of the new Strategic Air Command. They were replaced by the Twelfth Air Force 100th and 301st Fighter Squadrons, part of the Tuskegee Airmen 332d Fighter Group moved to Lucera in July from their wartime base at Ramitelli Airfield, while awaiting demobilization orders. The Tuskegee Airmen remained at Lucera until the end of September when they departed for the United States and subsequent demobilization. Sometime after that departure, the engineers moved in and dismantled the facility. Today Lucera Airfield has been returned to agriculture; however, extensive scarring of the landscape remains, showing various dispersal pads and taxiways and other features.

Brighouse was one of the first people to claim to be the \\"One Mighty and Strong\\" that Joseph Smith, Jr. had prophesied of in 1832. He was born in Loughborough, Leicestershire, England, on 14 September 1841.England, Leicestershire Parish Registers, 1533-1991,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QP4M-W3CZ : 6 June 2018), James Brighouse, 24 Oct 1841; records extracted by findmypast, images digitized by FamilySearch Brighouse died on 17 July 1916, in South Cottonwood, Utah, United States. Order of Enoch On December 7, 1884, a few members of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints met in Independence, Missouri to organize what they called the Order of Enoch or the Church or Kingdom of Christ.History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 4:466. The leaders of group were Brighouse and Lars Peterson. James Brighouse and Lars Peterson published The Voice at Midnight on December 25, 1884, in Independence, Missouri. This 4-page tract called for a return to the law of consecration. A form titled \\"Deed or Covenant\\" is part of the tract. This form provided for the consecration of property to the Bishop. The tract also called for the followers of Christ to devote themselves to Christ's teachings and become sanctified and pure in heart. Teachings Brighouse taught that Brigham Young had led the majority of Latter Day Saints astray by teaching plural marriage. Brighouse claimed that he was the \\"One Mighty and Strong\\" that Joseph Smith had prophesied would come to \\"set in order the house of God\\". In 1891, Brighouse traveled to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. It was believed by some Latter Day Saints that Joseph Smith had prophesied that Jesus Christ would return to earth by 1891; Brighouse went to the incomplete Salt Lake Temple and declared that he was Jesus, whose coming had been prophesied. Brighouse preached in Salt Lake City for a few days and converted a handful of followers. One of those followers, Dr. Henry I. Doremus, a prominent educator in Utah, assisted with Brighouse's publications. Doremus was excommunicated by the Church, for non-conformity to the tenets of that sect - particularly for his refusal to recognize the leaders of the church as the inspired agents and representatives of the Divinity. In Utah Territory in 1892, Brighouse published a book called The Voice of the Seventh Angel, Proclaiming the End of Time! The Resurrection of the Dead! The Day of Final Judgment! and the Rule of Righteousness and Peace!. The following are some of the primary teachings in the book: * The Latter-day Saints have only the priesthood of Aaron, and no longer have the higher priesthood, known as the Melchizedek priesthood.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part one, page 16. * After the death of Joseph Smith, the Twelve Apostles had no right to create a higher quorum or president of the Church.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part one, page 8. Brigham Young was chosen to lead them to Utah, but he has taught false doctrines and led the Saints astray. He sinned in appointing himself the President of the Church in 1847, without a Revelation from the Lord.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part one, pages 7-12. * Regarding resurrection and reincarnation, Brighouse taught that eternal life is the possession of power to always live, or to be changed in the twinkling of an eye, or to immediately enter another tabernacle.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part one, page 18. * The interior of the earth is inhabited with its teeming millions of human life and other creatures and it is where Jesus went to preach to the spirits in prison. It is in the earth, in darkness. It is the bottomless pit, spoken of in the Book of Revelation. It is the open space through the center of the earth, an atmosphere or space hundreds of miles across.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part one, page 19-22. * America is the land the sheep of the Lord should flock to. It is their land.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part two, page 51. It was once the location of the Garden of Eden, where Adam lived.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part one, page 5. Zion should be established in that same area in the center of the Western Continent (near Independence, MO).The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part four, page 40. * Heaven is on the earth; and not far away, as the blind guides teach and preach; it is not beyond the sky or on some other planet; but it is immediately where we dwell; the very globe upon which we find ourselves today has all the conditions and elements of our eternal heaven or hell, and so hath every other earth throughout boundless space.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part four, page 39. * Every government on earth is bound, controlled, or influenced by a secret combination (secret organizations); paralyzing the very lifestrings of freedom and liberty; working behind the scenes in secret conclaves, and beyond the reach of the laws of any nation or kingdom on earth.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part three, pages 15-16. * Zion must be built on the correct principles of government which is the preservation of agency, freedom, and righteousness. Also by love and not unrighteous authority.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part one, pg. 31; part two pg. 30; part four pg. 20-21. * A man can become a god by obtaining a fullness of light, love, and truth, in union with the eternal principles that govern heaven and earth.The Voice of the Seventh Angel, part three, pages 26-30.

Background Jews settled in Mizoch in the 18th century. In 1897, the total population of the town was 2,662 with 1,175 Jews owning factories for felt, oil and sugar production, as well as the flour mill and sawmills. Some Jews emigrated during World War I. According to the national census of 1921 in the Second Polish Republic there were 845 Jews in Mizocz, most of them identifying with the Turzysk Hasidism. Their numbers grew as the Polish economy improved.Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust page 832. It was an urban community between world wars like many others in Kresy (eastern Poland), inhabited by Jews and Poles along with members of other minorities including Ukrainians. There was a military school in Mizocz for the officer cadets of the Battalion 11 of the Polish Army's First Brigade; the Karwicki Palace (built in 1790, partly destroyed by the Bolsheviks in 1917), Hotel Barmocha Fuksa, a Catholic and an Orthodox church, and a Synagogue. The nearest major city was R√≥wno. Mizoch is situated some east of Dubno.JewishGen, Jewish Communities in Volhynia JewishGen Database, New York. Before the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, the town, Mizocz, was located in the Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic. Annexed by the USSR following the 1939 Soviet invasion of eastern Poland, Mizocz was occupied by the Wehrmacht in Operation Barbarossa, the June 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. Some 300 Jews escaped with the retreating Soviets.  Uprising and mass killings  On October 12, 1942, the closed-off ghetto of about 1,700 Jews was surrounded by Ukrainian Auxiliary Police and German policemen in preparation for the ghetto liquidation action. The Jews fought back in an uprising which may have lasted as long as two days. About half the residents were able to flee or hide during the confusion before the uprising was put down. On October 14, the captured survivors were transported in lorries to a secluded ravine and shot.Shmuel Spector, quoting the memoirs of Peretz Goldstein, The Jews of Volhynia and Their Reaction to Extermination. = Photographs = The shootings were photographed.The USHMM collections (2012), Photographs of the Mizocz shootings.

The images owned by SS- Unterscharf√ºhrer Sch√§fer until 1945 became part of the Ludwigsburg investigation (ZSt. II 204 AR 1218/70). They were published, and have become well known. Frequently the photographs are erroneously said to depict other Holocaust shootings. Two of the photographs show the \\"Aktion\\" in progress. The photographs give clear evidence of the execution practice common during the Holocaust by bullet in Reichskommissariat Ukraine. The victims were led to the killing place in groups of around five or so individuals, and forced to lie down among the prior victims, to be shot in the back of the neck or head, with a single bullet. Historians have commented upon the brutality shown in the Mizocz mass murder photographs: Naked Jewish women wait in a line before their execution by German Police with the assistance of Ukrainian auxiliaries.

Some 60 percent of the homes were set on fire and burned. Among the victims was Ukrainian carpenter Mr Zachmacz and his entire family, murdered along with the Poles because he refused to enter the fray. His eight-year-old son survived hiding with the Poles. Following World War II, Poland's borders were redrawn and Mizoch was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. The Jewish community was never restored. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the town became part of the independent Ukraine.Sylwester Fertacz (2005), \\"Krojenie mapy Polski: Bolesna granica\\" (Carving of Poland's map).

It may be a hardware device or a software program running on a secure host computer. In either case, it must have at least two network interfaces, one for the network it is intended to protect, and one for the network it is exposed to. A firewall sits at the junction point or gateway between the two networks, usually a private network and a public network such as the Internet.  Evolution of distributed firewall  Conventional firewalls rely on the notions of restricted topology and control entry points to function. More precisely, they rely on the assumption that everyone on one side of the entry point‚Äîthe firewall‚Äîis to be trusted, and that anyone on the other side is, at least potentially, an enemy. Distributed firewalls are host-resident security software applications that protect the enterprise network's servers and end- user machines against unwanted intrusion. They offer the advantage of filtering traffic from both the Internet and the internal network. This enables them to prevent hacking attacks that originate from both the Internet and the internal network. This is important because the most costly and destructive attacks still originate from within the organization. They are like personal firewalls except they offer several important advantages like central management, logging, and in some cases, access-control granularity. These features are necessary to implement corporate security policies in larger enterprises. Policies can be defined and pushed out on an enterprise- wide basis. A feature of distributed firewalls is centralized management. The ability to populate servers and end-users machines, to configure and \\"push out\\" consistent security policies helps to maximize limited resources. The ability to gather reports and maintain updates centrally makes distributed security practical. Distributed firewalls help in two ways. Remote end-user machines can be secured. Secondly, they secure critical servers on the network preventing intrusion by malicious code and \\"jailing\\" other such code by not letting the protected server be used as a launch pad for expanded attacks. Usually deployed behind the traditional firewall, they provide a second layer of defense. They work by enabling only essential traffic into the machine they protect, prohibiting other types of traffic to prevent unwanted intrusions. Whereas the perimeter firewall must take a generalist, common denominator approach to protecting servers on the network, distributed firewalls act as specialists. Some problems with the conventional firewalls that lead to Distributed firewalls are as follows. Due to the increasing line speeds and the more computation intensive protocols that a firewall must support; firewalls tend to become congestion points. This gap between processing and networking speeds is likely to increase, at least for the foreseeable future; while computers (and hence firewalls) are getting faster, the combination of more complex protocols and the tremendous increase in the amount of data that must be passed through the firewall has been and likely will continue to out pace Moore's law. There exist protocols, and new protocols are designed, that are difficult to process at the firewall, because the latter lacks certain knowledge that is readily available at the endpoints. FTP and RealAudio are two such protocols. Although there exist application-level proxies that handle such protocols, such solutions are viewed as architecturally ‚Äúunclean‚Äù and in some cases too invasive. Likewise, because of the dependence on the network topology, a PF can only enforce a policy on traffic that traverses it. Thus, traffic exchanged among nodes in the protected network cannot be controlled. This gives an attacker that is already an insider or can somehow bypass the firewall complete freedom to act. Worse yet, it has become trivial for anyone to establish a new, unauthorized entry point to the network without the administrator's knowledge and consent. Various forms of tunnels, wireless, and dial-up access methods allow individuals to establish backdoor access that bypasses all the security mechanisms provided by traditional firewalls. While firewalls are in general not intended to guard against misbehavior by insiders, there is a tension between internal needs for more connectivity and the difficulty of satisfying such needs with a centralized firewall. IPsec is a protocol suite, recently standardized by the IETF, which provides network- layer security services such as packet confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, replay protection, and automated key management. This is an artifact of firewall deployment: internal traffic that is not seen by the firewall cannot be filtered; as a result, internal users can mount attacks on other users and networks without the firewall being able to intervene. Large networks today tend to have a large number of entry points (for performance, failover, and other reasons). Furthermore, many sites employ internal firewalls to provide some form of compartmentalization. This makes administration particularly difficult, both from a practical point of view and with regard to policy consistency, since no unified and comprehensive management mechanism exists. End-to-end encryption can also be a threat to firewalls, as it prevents them from looking at the packet fields necessary to do filtering. Allowing end-to-end encryption through a firewall implies considerable trust to the users on behalf of the administrators. Finally, there is an increasing need for finer-grained access control which standard firewalls cannot readily accommodate without greatly increasing their complexity and processing requirements. Distributed firewalls are host- resident security software applications that protect the enterprise network's critical endpoints against unwanted intrusion that is, its servers and end- user machines. In this concept, the security policy is defined centrally and the enforcement of the policy takes place at each endpoint (hosts, routers, etc.). Usually deployed behind the traditional firewall, they provide a second layer of protection. Since all the hosts on the inside are trusted equally, if any of these machines are subverted, they can be used to launch attacks to other hosts, especially to trusted hosts for protocols like rlogin. Thus there is a faithful effort from the industry security organizations to move towards a system which has all the aspects of a desktop firewall but with centralized management like Distributed Firewalls. Distributed, host-resident firewalls prevent the hacking of both the PC and its use as an entry point into the enterprise network. A compromised PC can make the whole network vulnerable to attacks. The hacker can penetrate the enterprise network uncontested and steal or corrupt corporate assets. = Basic working = Distributed firewalls are often kernel-mode applications that sit at the bottom of the OSI stack in the operating system. They filter all traffic regardless of its origin‚Äîthe Internet or the internal network. They treat both the Internet and the internal network as \\"unfriendly\\". They guard the individual machine in the same way that the perimeter firewall guards the overall network. Distributed firewalls rest on three notions: * A policy language that states what sort of connections are permitted or prohibited, * Any of a number of system management tools, such as Microsoft's SMS or ASD, and * IPSEC, the network- level encryption mechanism for Internet Protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.). The basic idea is simple. A compiler translates the policy language into some internal format. The system management software distributes this policy file to all hosts that are protected by the firewall. And incoming packets are accepted or rejected by each \\"inside\\" host, according to both the policy and the cryptographically-verified identity of each sender.  Policies  One of the most often used term in case of network security and in particular distributed firewall is policy. It is essential to know about policies. A ‚Äúsecurity policy‚Äù defines the security rules of a system. Without a defined security policy, there is no way to know what access is allowed or disallowed. A simple example for a firewall is: *Allow all connections to the web server. *Deny all other access. The distribution of the policy can be different and varies with the implementation. It can be either directly pushed to end systems, or pulled when necessary. = Pull technique = The hosts while booting up pings to the central management server to check whether the central management server is up and active. It registers with the central management server and requests for its policies which it should implement. The central management server provides the host with its security policies. For example, a license server or a security clearance server can be asked if a certain communication should be permitted. A conventional firewall could do the same, but it lacks important knowledge about the context of the request. End systems may know things like which files are involved, and what their security levels might be. Such information could be carried over a network protocol, but only by adding complexity. = Push technique = The push technique is employed when the policies are updated at the central management side by the network administrator and the hosts have to be updated immediately. This push technology ensures that the hosts always have the updated policies at any time. The policy language defines which inbound and outbound connections on any component of the network policy domain are allowed, and can affect policy decisions on any layer of the network, being it at rejecting or passing certain packets or enforcing policies at the Application Layer.  Components of a distributed firewall  * A central management system for designing the policies. * A transmission system to transmit these policies. * Implementation of the designed policies in the client end. = Central management system = Central Management, a component of distributed firewalls, makes it practical to secure enterprise-wide servers, desktops, laptops, and workstations. Central management provides greater control and efficiency and it decreases the maintenance costs of managing global security installations. This feature addresses the need to maximize network security resources by enabling policies to be centrally configured, deployed, monitored, and updated. From a single workstation, distributed firewalls can be scanned to understand the current operating policy and to determine if updating is required. = Policy distribution = The policy distribution scheme should guarantee the integrity of the policy during transfer. The distribution of the policy can be different and varies with the implementation. It can be either directly pushed to end systems, or pulled when necessary. = Host-end implementation = The security policies transmitted from the central management server have to be implemented by the host. The host end part of the Distributed Firewall does provide any administrative control for the network administrator to control the implementation of policies. The host allows traffic based on the security rules it has implemented.  Threat comparison  Distributed firewalls have both strengths and weaknesses when compared to conventional firewalls. By far the biggest difference, of course, is their reliance on topology. If the network topology does not permit reliance on traditional firewall techniques, there is little choice. A more interesting question is how the two types compare in a closed, single-entry network. That is, if either will work, is there a reason to choose one over the other? = Service exposure and port scanning = Both types of firewalls are excellent at rejecting connection requests for inappropriate services. Conventional firewalls drop the requests at the border; distributed firewalls do so at the host. A more interesting question is what is noticed by the host attempting to connect. Today, such packets are typically discarded, with no notification. A distributed firewall may choose to discard the packet, under the assumption that its legal peers know to use IPSEC; alternatively, it may instead send back a response requesting that the connection be authenticated, which in turn gives notice of the existence of the host. Firewalls built on pure packet filters cannot reject some \\"stealth scans\\" very well. One technique, for example, uses fragmented packets that can pass through unexamined because the port numbers aren't present in the first fragment. A distributed firewall will reassemble the packet and then reject it. On balance, against this sort of threat the two firewall types are at least comparable. = IP address spoofing = On network addresses is not a favored concept. Using cryptographic mechanisms most likely prevents attacks based on forged source addresses, under the assumption that the trusted repository containing all necessary credentials has not been subject to compromise in itself. These problems can be solved by conventional firewalls with corresponding rules for discarding packets at the network perimeter but will not prevent such attacks originating from inside the network policy domain. = Malicious software = With the spread use of distributed object-oriented systems like CORBA, client-side use of Java and weaknesses in mail readers and the like there is a wide variety of threats residing in the application and intermediate level of communication traffic. Firewall mechanisms at the perimeter can come useful by inspecting incoming e-mails for known malicious code fingerprints, but can be confronted with complex, thus resource-consuming situations when making decisions on other code, like Java. Using the framework of a distributed firewall and especially considering a policy language which allows for policy decision on the application level can circumvent some of these problems, under the condition that contents of such communication packets can be interpreted semantically by the policy verifying mechanisms. Stateful inspection of packets shows up to be easily adapted to these requirements and allows for finer granularity in decision making. Furthermore, malicious code contents may be completely disguised to the screening unit at the network perimeter, given the use of virtual private networks and enciphered communication traffic in general and can completely disable such policy enforcement on conventional firewalls. = Intrusion detection = Many firewalls detect attempted intrusions. If that functionality is to be provided by a distributed firewall, each individual host has to notice probes and forward them to some central location for processing and correlation. The former problem is not hard; many hosts already log such attempts. One can make a good case that such detection should be done in any event. Collection is more problematic, especially at times of poor connectivity to the central site. There is also the risk of coordinated attacks in effect causing a denial-of-service attack against the central machine. = Insider attacks = Given the natural view of a conventional firewall on the network topology as consisting of an inside and outside, problems can arise, once one or more members of the policy network domain have been compromised. Perimeter firewalls can only enforce policies between distinct networks and show no option to circumvent problems which arise in the situation discussed above. Given a distributed firewalls independence on topological constraints supports the enforcement of policies whether hosts are members or outsiders of the overall policy domain and base their decisions on authenticating mechanisms which are not inherent characteristics of the networks layout. Moreover, compromise of an endpoint either by a legitimate user or intruder will not weaken the overall network in a way that leads directly to compromise of other machines, given the fact that the deployment of virtual private networks prevents sniffing of communication traffic in which the attacked machine is not involved. On the other side, on the end- point itself nearly the same problems arise as in conventional firewalls: Assuming that a machine has been taken over by an adversary must lead to the conclusion that the policy enforcement mechanisms them self may be broken. The installation of backdoors on this machine can be done quite easily once the security mechanisms are flawed and in the lack of a perimeter firewall, there is no trusted entity anymore which might prevent arbitrary traffic entering or leaving the compromised host. Additionally use of tools like SSH and the like allow tunneling of other applications communication and can not be prevented without proper knowledge of the decrypting credentials, moreover given the fact that in case an attack has shown up successfully the verifying mechanisms in them self may not be trusted anymore. At first glance, the biggest weakness of distributed firewalls is their greater susceptibility to lack of cooperation by users. What happens if someone changes the policy files on their own? Distributed firewalls can reduce the threat of actual attacks by insiders, simply by making it easier to set up smaller groups of users. Thus, one can restrict access to a file server to only those users who need it, rather than letting anyone inside the company pound on it. It is also worth expending some effort to prevent casual subversion of policies. If policies are stored in a simple ASCII file, a user wishing to, for example, play a game could easily turn off protection. Requiring the would-be uncooperative user to go to more trouble is probably worthwhile, even if the mechanism is theoretically insufficient. For example, policies could be digitally signed, and verified by a frequently-changing key in an awkward-to-replace location. For more stringent protections, the policy enforcement can be incorporated into a tamper-resistant network card.
