The film, set in Paris in 1984, explores the lives of a closely knit group of friends who are impacted with the sudden outbreak of the AIDS epidemic. The Witnesses was critically acclaimed. Plot It is the summer of 1984 in Paris. Sarah, a well-to-do writer of children's books, and her working-class husband, Mehdi, an inspector of North African descent, are confronting some marital problems after the recent arrival of their first child. Sarah, stumbling over a bout of writer's block, has little maternal instinct towards their newborn baby, whose cries she tunes out with earplugs while she works. Her husband despairs when she neglects the child, does what he can to fill in, and sometimes parks the child with his parents. The couple have an open marriage and both are allowed to take outside lovers in a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù arrangement that seems to work, although not without tensions. Meanwhile, Sarah's close friend Adrien, a middle-aged gay doctor, meets Manu, a carefree young man, at a cruising ground. Manu is not sexually attracted to Adrien and they do not have sex, but strike an emotional friendship. Manu is happy with the friendship and becomes Adrien's companion and his student of life's finer things. Wildly in love with his shallow, narcissistic prot√©g√©, Adrien is shrewd enough not to push too hard, but there is an element of masochism in his abject devotion. Manu, who has recently arrived to Paris from a provincial town in the south of France, shares a space with his sister Julie, while she struggles to affirm herself as an opera singer. They live in a cheap hotel that is a center of prostitution. This does not bother Manu, and he has a friendly relationship with Sandra, a prostitute. The hotel is under scrutiny by Mehdi, who leads the police force's vice division. Through Adrien, Manu meets Sarah and Mehdi. The group of friends get together at Sarah's mother‚Äô summerhouse in the Calanques of Marseille. One afternoon, when Mehdi and Manu go swimming in a remote cove, Mehdi saves Manu from drowning and, while tugging him to shore and administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, becomes aroused. Later, when Manu makes a pass at Mehdi, he responds, and they embark on a secret, no-strings-attached love affair. They meet at the holiday camping site outside Paris, where Manu now works as a cook. When Manu confesses to Adrien that he has been having sex with Mehdi, Adrian is furious and hits Manu. After the fight, Adrian discovers spots on Manu's skin; it turns out that he has AIDS. Sarah tries to write a novel, and as a result Mehdi leaves temporarily to stay at his parents with the baby. Adrien becomes a leader in a medical crusade against AIDS, while meanwhile privately taking on Manu's treatment. Mehdi also does not shun his friend when he hears the news, although he is terrified that he has AIDS and cannot bring himself to tell his wife. He wants to see Manu, but Manu does not want to see him in the terrible state he is in. By contrast, Adrien is safe as his relationship with Manu was more companion-based than sexual. Desperate to see his former lover, Mehdi forces his way into the camping site. Manu shows him his gun, with which he will commit suicide when his illness gets worse. Mehdi secretly takes it with him and throws it in the Seine. Mehdi is relieved that he has not been infected. Sarah has not been infected either and they reconcile. Manu's health deteriorates and he commits suicide with pills supplied by Adrien for this purpose. Julie and Adrien take Manu's body to be buries in his native village to his grieving mother. Before he passes away, Manu uses a tape recorder to dictate his life for others to hear of. Sarah is inspired by the events as they have transpired so far and, once he is gone, listens to the tapes and begins writing a tale (for grown-ups) of it. She is free of her writer's block. Medhi is a bit concerned his life will become gossip, but Sarah assures him she has changed the names in the story. Julie decides to move to Munich, Mehdi and Adrien make amends while Sandra is HIV positive. The following summer, Sarah, Mehdi, Adrien and his new companion Steve, a young American, return to the summerhouse on the Riviera to celebrate Sarah and Medhi's child's birthday.

I don‚Äôt know if Mehdi‚Äôs affair with Manu is his first or last gay experience; I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs been with other guys or might so in the future. I show my characters at a certain moment in their lives, which reveals certain aspects of them, but it is the tip of the iceberg. The rest, even if we get glimpses of it in the film, is left to the imagination of each person in the audience.Sight & Sound, November 2007. Interview with T√©chin√© about The Witnesses, p.47 Commenting about the characters on The Witnesses, T√©chin√© said: \\"I prefer people to be moved by Manu when he runs, climbs a tree or burst out laughing than when he is sick. For me, that would be akin to taking the audience hostage and I reject that. But I don‚Äôt reject emotion itself  rather I shift it around instead of placing it where it becomes predictable. I hope audiences find Manu moving in the upbeat scenes in the first half of the film: It is good time shared, not compassion in bad times, that makes good friends. As Sarah‚Äôs mother says in the film it‚Äôs a miracle being alive. And it is this sense of miracle that I wanted to conclude and open the film, broadening the horizon by revisiting spaces that Manu has inhabited and rediscovering them without him, with another character traveling through. Perhaps loving Manu and bearing witnesses to his life makes the other protagonist stronger\\". Music The original score for the film was written by Alain Sarde, regular composer in T√©chin√©'s films.Marshall, Andr√© T√©chin√©, p. 157 The sound track includes an eclectic mix of artist and styles like: * Marcia Baila Les Rita Mitsouko * I'm a lover Andrea * Don't Forget the Nite Les Rita Mitsouko * Qual Favellar ? from Lorlando finto pazzo Act 3 Antonio Vivaldi * Barbarina's Aria from Le nozze di Figaro Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart * Restez avec Moi Les Rita Mitsouko * Docteur Miracle Johan Lib√©reau Reception The film was acclaimed by critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 48 reviews. The critical consensus is: \\"Andr√© Techin√© successfully weaves five gripping stories in an engaging and realistic film about the early days of the AIDS epidemic.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 75 based on 15 reviews. Jan Stuart of Newsday wrote: \\"Andr√© Techin√©'s The Witnesses is one of the finest fiction-film accounts of a free yet frightful moment in time, when the relaxing sexual liberties of the previous decade were being squeezed by the onset of an unforgiving new virus.\\" In Variety Deborah Young commented: \\"What the characters in The Witnesses  and the audience  pay testimony to in Andr√© T√©chin√©'s urgent, compassionate, and ultimately optimistic French drama are the toll the epidemic has rung, and the responsibility of the living to choose life\\". Nathan Lee in The Village Voice wrote: \\"T√©chin√©'s triumph of compassion and craft shames the American cinema's indifference to gay history.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert commented: \\"The Witnesses doesn't pay off with a great operatic pinnacle, but it's better that way. Better to show people we care about facing facts they care desperately about, without the consolation of plot mechanics\\". Ken Fox in TV Guide wrote: \\" Techine‚Äôs unwillingness to soften his characters reflects a rare honesty particularly movies about fatal illness, and his film is an engaging and particularly French character study about human nature that‚Äôs rarely seen in the movies\\". New York Press critic Armond White, who has been T√©chin√©'s most fervent U.S. supporter, hailed The Witnesses: \\"No filmmaker has a greater appreciation of human diversity than T√©chin√©, whose socially complex melodramas always feature age, gender and race through libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©. That's T√©chin√©'s radical vision of France  postmodern, post-Colonial and post-gay liberation with all those issues in motion.\\" In The New York Times, Stephen Holden warned viewers that: \\"The Witnesses may frustrate those who prefer movies that tell clear-cut stories in which hard lessons are learned. But in the director's farsighted vision of life, the ground under our feet is always shifting. As time pulls us forward, the shocks of the past are absorbed and the pain recedes. In its light-handed way, The Witnesses is profound.\\" David Denby in his review for The New Yorker wrote: \\"T√©chin√© is unusually adroit at manipulating a complex set of relations within a very mixed group of people. This movie is easy to take  chatty and sociable, with a brightly lit, even sunshiny gloss and an open sensuality\\".  DVD release  The film was released on DVD in the United States on 24 June 2008.

It was one of a series of films produced in the Harlequin Romance Movie Series (USA). It was one of a series of romance adaptations for television directed by Don Sharp. The film is based on the novel of the same name written by Pamela Wallace and published in the Silhouette Special Edition line of romance novels in 1985 by Simon & Schuster before the Silhouette brand was acquired by Harlequin. There are alterations to the plot line made by the screenwriter but the essential story has stayed the same. The action and events take place in two time periods in England, the 1940s and the 1980s. The World War Two story is told in flashbacks. Plot Jessie Cantrell's dying wish is that her daughter Casey (Sharon Stone) personally take a letter to Lord Richard Bredon who lives in the UK. Viewing the matter as a sacred trust Casey sets off for England from her horse farm in Kentucky. A failed attempt to find him at his country residence has her falling from a wall into the arms of Lord Bredon's playboy son, Michael (Christopher Cazenove). Casey manages to escape his grilling without giving her name, but the younger Bredon tracks her to an inn in the local village where he uses his clout to get it. Casey accepts his dinner invitation in order to learn the whereabouts of his father. The evening is spent with Michael attempting to seduce her and trying to get information out of her. It ends with neither one being any more informed than when it started. Wanting to see her again and to continue to try and solve her mystery Michael uses the lure of his stable to get her to visit Bredon Hall the next day. While she is there, Michael's flamboyant best friend Hamdan al Dubai (Leigh Lawson) arrives with his manservant Fordingbridge to discuss a filly with the horse manager. Much to Michael's annoyance Hamdan immediately homes in on Casey and begins enacting what is most likely an age old game between them of trying to steal the other's most recent conquest. After Casey learns that Michael's father is in London she accepts an offer made by Hamdan to go back there with him. This arouses Michael's suspicions a fresh and on a horseback ride while they wait for Hamdan to conclude his business he makes another unsuccessful effort for details Arriving back in London, Casey is able to find Lord Bredon at his office in Half Moon Square. While visibly shaken by the news of Jessie's death, he denies ever having known her and refuses to accept the letter. Instead of deterring her, Richard's confusing reaction only serves to make her more determined to uncover the mystery. Back at the hotel she finds that Michael has sent her flowers and during a phone call to thank him he asks her out for the afternoon of the following day. The scene then switches to Richard's office at Bredon Enterprises where he is clearly caught up in memories of the past brought on by his earlier meeting with Casey. The next day Hamdan calls to charm Casey into having lunch with him on his yacht. Michael, upon finding out her plans with Hamden, shows up at lunch uninvited but not unexpected by Fordingbridge who appears to be used to games that Michael and Hamdan play. The talk switches to a discussion of the party going on at Hamdan's house that evening. Hamdan invites her to the event but it's not until she finds out Lord Bredon is going to be there that she accepts. Later that evening as Casey is preparing to go she and Michael quibble over the cost of the dress he has bought her for the party. When she capitulates to him he looks over and happens to see that she's wearing a necklace that reminds him of his family crest. When she claims that it belonged to her mother he persists in trying to talk about it but she laughing blows off the conversation. At the party Casey and Michael are having a great time but that is soon stopped by a confrontation with his father who accuses her of being a con artist and tells his son about her trip to his office. Michael, who has a deep fear of being taken in by a woman, immediately lays into her. Casey becomes distraught by both men attacking her and runs off. Michael chases after her ultimately cornering her in a garden house where they end up in a passionate embrace. He agrees to hear her side of the story and the pair leave the party. Richard observes them leaving and a firework going off nearby takes him into a flashback. The scene changes to WWII where a young Richard and a woman who is clearly Jessie Cantrell flee to a bomb shelter during a German air strike. In the shelter Richard admits his love for Jessie despite having known her for only a short time. Coming out of the flashback Richard asks Hamdan to dig up information on Casey. Hamdan expresses his discomfort with the situation but this falls on deaf ears. Michael and Casey arrive at his apartment after her having told him the story about the letter on the way there. The two reexamine the pendant with him verifying that is the family crest. She postulates the theory that her mother and his father knew each other during the war. The scene fades to Richard driving home from the party and having a flashback about when he first met Jessie. It is revealed in the course of the flashback that Jessie was living with a friend of Richard's named Emily and that she was married to someone named Frank and that Frank appears to have died. The scene switches again back to the present day where Casey and Michael are talking about how Jessie might have met Richard. This leads to Michael seducing a somewhat reluctant Casey and carrying her off to bed. Later Richard arrives back at Half Moon Square, and it's revealed that the place was where Richard and Jessie used to meet. The next morning Hamdan sees Michael and Casey in a clinch on Michael's balcony. He's next seen talking with Richard on the phone. Richard asks him to work on Casey while he talks to Michael who is planning to come into the office. Once again Hamden expresses reluctance to involve himself in the situation but Richard hangs up on him. Hamdan then goes to see Casey at her hotel and ends up going with her to track down a woman whose name is in her mother's address book. While riding down the river Hamdan makes his position clear about his friendship with the Bredons, especially Michael, and that he wouldn't allow anyone to harm them. Casey swears that she would never do that. Back the office Richard confronts Michael about not getting rid of Casey and then Michael turns the confrontation on him asking how Casey's mother got the pendant. Richard kicks him out and goes into a flashback where it's revealed that Richard did in fact gave the pendant to Jessie. At a pub on the river Fordingbridge, who does a bit of sleuthing while getting drinks, reveals that the older lady he and Hamdan see Casey talking to is an old friend of her mother's named Billie Cooper. The scene shifts to Casey talking with Billie who confirms that Jessie was in England during the war. Billie further reveals that she came over as a member of the USO to follow Frank, Casey's father. Billie tells her about a fateful mission in which Frank was believed to have died trying to save Billie's husband. Billie continues the story where she confirms that Richard and Jessie knew one another and that their interest in each other was much to the disappointment of Richard's old friend, Jessie's flatmate Emily. A flashback reveals that Jessie got a telegram saying that Frank was still alive complicating her situation with Richard. As the two are talking Hamdan finally calls a PI to investigate Casey. Later at Michael's apartment Casey brings him up to speed on the situation. Michael has difficulty taking in this new information about his father and Casey expresses discomfort about what she sees as a shifting perspective of her parents. Michael and Casey end up revealing their feelings for one another and Michael asks Casey to marry him. At first she questions whether he really means it given their short acquaintance, and he explains that he feels that he has at last found what he believes to be true love. She accepts his proposal. Later at Bredon Hall, Michael tries to get Richard to read Jessie's letter. Richard continues to refuse. Michael confronts him with the knowledge that he knows about his relationship with Jessie. Richard, feeling that he can no longer deny it to Michael, confesses to having been in love with her. He also believes that Jessie screwed him over. Michael tells him that he is in love with Casey and plans to marry her. Richard continues to assert that he believes Casey to be a con artist and Michael walks out on him. A flashback reveals that Richard did intend to ask Jessie to marry him but when she didn't show up for their scheduled meeting he found out from Emily that Jessie had disappeared. Later Richard goes to meet with Hamdan at Bredon Enterprises to find out the results of the investigation on Casey. He not only learns that Casey's record is clear but that Frank was discovered not to have died around the time that Jessie vanished. This changes his whole perspective on what happened and he contacts Michael to apologize. Michael leaves Casey alone at his apartment to go to see his father. While she is alone there Casey receives a visit from Michael's mother. She turns out to be the Emily whose flat Jessie shared while she was in England. Emily tells the rest of the story which involves her meeting up with Jessie sometime after she had left London. Jessie was caring for Frank who was now being treated for blindness that he got from the explosion and wasn't aware that Jessie was pregnant with Richard's baby. Emily revealed to Jessie that she had married Richard and agreed to take and raise the baby as her own. The baby turns out to be Michael of course and the revelation prohibits marriage between him and Casey. Casey flees the flat and runs to Hamdan. After crying her heart out in the cabin on his yacht she tells Hamdan that she is leaving and asks him to take her to the airport. Fordingbridge, alarmed by the situation, calls Michael to tell him what was going on, and Michael races to the pier to try and talk to Casey. At first she is reluctant to do so but Hamdan convinces her that she must and she reveals to Michael the story Emily told her. At Bredon Enterprises Richard confronts Emily about what happened believing that somehow she interfered. A flashback reveals that in her determination to be the mistress of Bredon Hall and Richard's wife she manipulated events so that Richard was led to believe that Jessie had abandoned him. She then screws the knife in further by revealing to him the truth about Michael. Fordingbridge and Hamden arrive at the hotel to take Casey to the airport. Fordingbridge, who has developed a fondness Casey, has provided Hamden another file on her and his attitude reveals that he believes Hamden's probing has something to do with why Casey is leaving. On the drive, Casey reveals the whole story to Hamdan. As she dozes off in the seat next to him a flummoxed Hamdan remembers the file Fordingbridge gave him and looks through it. Whatever is in the file causes Hamdan mood to change for the positive and the then leans over and whispers something to Fordingbridge. Fordingbridge changes the car's direction. Back at Bredon Hall Richard and Michael have gotten together to share the reading of the letter. Hamdan's car pulls up outside and Casey awakens from her nap to find that she's there. She is distressed by this but Hamdan convinces her to come in with him. Once in the room with Michael and his father Hamdan hands Richard the file. Richard reads through it and then goes to sit next to Casey. He apologizes to her for how he behaved then reveals that according to the file Casey is actually not Jessie's and Frank's biological child and that she was adopted thus clearing the way for Casey and Michael's relationship to move forward. As Michael rushes to her side Richard lets her know that as Jessie sent her there to them they are now her family. The film closes with Richard rereading Jessie's letter then watching Michael and Casey from the window as they embrace.

Over his career in the NBA, Mathis officiated nearly 2,340 games, including 12 NBA Finals and three NBA All-Star Games. Mathis wore uniform number 13 during his career. Mathis is also the owner and Chief Executive Officer of ProHoop Courts, Inc., which specializes in the installation of basketball goal systems and playing surfaces. Early life Mathis is a graduate of St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, and a 1964 graduate of Purdue University. After college, he became an officer in the army. In 1966-67, Mathis was an engineer in Vietnam during the Vietnam War.Smith, Sam. \\"Traveling Call\\", Chicago Tribune online, 28 October 1998. Retrieved 15 June 2019. From 1967 to 1972, Mathis began officiating as a high school basketball referee. In 1972, he worked college basketball games in the Big Ten, Mid-American, and Ohio Valley Conferences until being hired by the NBA in 1976. NBA officiating career =First game= Mathis' first game in the NBA was memorable for involving a fight between the Chicago Bulls and Milwaukee Bucks at Western Michigan University's University Arena. Throughout the game, Mathis and referee Joe Gushue called 15 technical fouls and ejected five players, including Bulls' guard Jerry Sloan, Chicago coach Dick Motta, the Bucks' Swen Nater, and Bulls' Artis Gilmore. =NBA referees union leader= As his career progressed in the NBA, Mathis achieved greater influence among officials by serving on the executive committee of the NBA referees union from 1990 to 1997. During the period, he was involved in the negotiation of a new contract for referees, who went on strike to start the 1995‚Äì96 NBA season. =Airline ticket income investigation= During the late 1990s, many NBA referees became the target of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) investigation of cash received as a result of the sale of first-class airline tickets for less expensive ones. The IRS claimed this was additional income that went unreported. In 1997, Mathis was indicted for falsifying income on tax returns and immediately resigned from the NBA. The following year, he pleaded guilty to tax evasion for understating income by $69,000 from 1989 through 1992. Mathis admitted to trading in first- class airline tickets provided by the NBA for cheaper, coach-class tickets and pocketing the difference and using several means to conceal income generated from downgrading seats, including obtaining bogus airline receipts and invoices from a travel agent in Denver, Colorado. A few months after pleading guilty, Mathis was sentenced to 120 days of home confinement, three years of probation, 200 hours of community service, and a $2,000 fine. =Return to the NBA= After nearly a two-year hiatus from the NBA, Commissioner David Stern reinstated Mathis and several other referees in January 1999 who were found guilty during the investigation. During his second stint in the NBA, Mathis officiated for two and a half seasons before retiring following a game played on December 16, 2001 in Seattle, Washington. He closed out his career as Seattle SuperSonics team officials at KeyArena shined a spotlight on him during a timeout and spectators gave him a standing ovation. Post-NBA officiating career Mathis returned to the Seattle area following retirement to serve as a team consultant for the SuperSonics on rules violations. Mathis has been an outspoken critic of the NBA's evaluation system of referees and league supervisors following allegations that former NBA referee Tim Donaghy was betting on league games. Mathis felt that only friends of league officials are hired to fill openings and the current supervisors are not qualified to do their jobs since he claims that \\"they were once referees, and they were fired. These are guys who should be teaching and training refs, but they have no business in those positions.\\" Barkley Vendetta On May 10, 2009, Charles Barkley stated on TNT's Pregame show that Mike Mathis is the only NBA referee that did not want to get all of the calls right, all of the time. He also later stated that Mathis was the worst official of all time. Barkley reiterated this point during halftime of the Marquette University vs. Syracuse Orangemen NCAA Tournament basketball game on March 20, 2011, and during halftime of Game 3 of the Los Angeles Clippers vs. Golden State Warriors 2014 NBA Playoffs when he said that most professional and college referees were good at their jobs, with the sole exception of Mike Mathis. During the Golden State Warriors vs. Los Angeles Clippers playoff broadcast on April 24, 2014, Barkley said, \\"Most refs are good guys, except Mike Mathis, he's not a good guy.\\" On the February 11, 2016 edition of Inside the NBA, Chuck said he respected all referees except Mathis.

It contains four transmembrane spanning helices with both N- and C-terminal domains located intracellularly. Loss of SSPN expression occurs in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Dystrophin is required for proper localization of SSPN. SSPN is also an essential regulator of Akt signaling pathways. Without SSPN, Akt signaling pathways will be hindered and muscle regeneration will not occur. Sarcospan in Muscular Dystrophy  The loss of dystrophin results in muscular dystrophy. SSPN upregulates the levels of Utrophin-glycoprotein complex (UGC) to make up for the loss of dystrophin in the neuromuscular junction. Sarcoglycans bind to SSPN and form the SG-SSPN complex, which interacts with dystroglycans (DG) and Utrophin leading to the formation of the UGC. SSPN regulates the amount of Utrophin produced by the UGC to restore laminin binding due to the absence of dystrophin. If laminin binding is not restored by SSPN, contraction of the membrane is present. In dystrophic mdx mice, SSPN increases levels of Utrophin and restores the levels of laminin binding, reducing the symptoms of muscular dystrophy  References   External links  * ","title":"Sarcospan"},{"id":"12231321","text":"Mount Uluigalau is the highest mountain on the island of Taveuni in Fiji.

NITV was initially only carried by cable and satellite providers, along with some limited over-the-air transmissions in certain remote areas. NITV was re-launched in December 2012 by the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) as a free-to-air channel. History = Predecessors of NITV = Indigenous groups and individuals lobbied the Australian Government to fund a nationwide Indigenous television service in the 1980s and 1990s, however no major political party championed this cause. In the late 1990s the Imparja Info Channel (also known as \\"Channel 31\\") was launched free-to-view on the satellite Optus Aurora service, providing largely Aboriginal programming direct to homes and via network of BRACS transmitters to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as Indigenous Community Television. In 2004, Imparja stated a desire to run a better funded service, at least within its license area. In the same year, a voluntary NITV Committee was formed and a summit was held in Redfern, Sydney. The summit involved a group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander media professionals and community members committed to the establishment of a national Indigenous broadcasting service. Following an Australian Government review in 2005, the Government announced $48.5 million in funding for NITV. = Establishment of NITV = In 2007, NITV established a head office in Alice Springs and a television arm in Sydney. On 13 July 2007 NITV launched, replacing Imparja Info Channel on Optus Aurora and in the remote Aboriginal communities it previously reached. It soon after also became available free- to-air on Optus D1 to Australia and eastern Papua New Guinea . NITV launched on Australian subscription television services on 1 November 2007 on Foxtel and Austar's satellite service on channel 180, with it becoming available on its cable service soon after. It showed Australian programs and sports like The Marngrook Footy Show, and the annual NSW Aboriginal Rugby League Knockout.NITV ‚Äì Media Room NITV logo (2012‚Äì2016) On 30 April 2010, NITV ceased broadcasting on Sydney's digital television Datacasting service along with other services. However, it remained available on subscription services Foxtel, Austar and Optus TV. = NITV as part of SBS = In 2010, the Australian Government commissioned a wide-ranging review of its investment in the Indigenous broadcasting and media sector. The review was headed up by retired senior public servant Neville Stevens with the assistance of Expert Panel members Laurie Patton and Kerrynne Liddle. The review recommended that NITV continue to receive government funding only on the basis that it was re- structured. Subsequently, Communications Minister Senator Stephen Conroy invited NITV to enter in negotiations with the Special Broadcasting Service to access one of that network's unused digital terrestrial channels. On 8 May 2012, SBS received $15m a year in government funding dedicated to a new free to air Indigenous Australian channel which would replace NITV in July 2012, with 90% of staff transferring to this new channel. SBS took over the management and operation of NITV on 1 July 2012, and NITV was re-launched on 12 December 2012 by SBS as a free-to-air channel on Freeview channel 34. Among its launch day programmes were two live broadcasts from Uluru, including From the Heart of Our Nation, a two-hour event to mark the channel's launch at Noon, and a concert in primetime simulcast by SBS One. On 29 February 2016, SBS unveiled a refreshed brand and revamped schedule for NITV with an increased focus on its central charter, Indigenous news and current affairs. Programming NITV News, is the network's national news program which is broadcast nightly, covering stories relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander viewers. NITV's line-up focuses on programming of interest to and showcasing indigenous Australians, such as documentaries, current affairs programs, sports, drama, adult animation and a block of domestic and international children's programming focusing on Indigenous and Aboriginal culture (under the name Jarjums), and films. It also broadcasts programs relating to First Nations culture worldwide.

The Alliance is both a Non-governmental organization and a Non-profit organization. Founded in 2001, the alliance consists of 67 member groups. The alliance was created to more efficiently coordinate the distribution of resources among different organizations operating under different circumstances. It regularly publishes educational material, holds conferences and workshops, and participates in movements that advance the rights and interests of Taiwan's women. Goals The goals of NATWA are manifold and include the following: 1\\\\. Promoting awareness of women's rights issues in Taiwan 2\\\\. Publicizing the content of UN treaties that specifically address women's issues 3\\\\. Decreasing the disparities between women in rural and urban areas 4\\\\. Collaborating with other women's organizations to promote women's interests 5\\\\. Monitoring government policy related to women's issues Activities =Lobbying= In 2002, NATWA, along with representatives from other women's groups, began lobbying legislators in both the Kuomintang and Democratic Progressive Party to set up an independent gender agency in the central government. They held a series of panel discussions and public hearings, eventually convincing the executive branch to include a special gender agency under the Organizational Reform Plan in 2005. Currently, the plan is still pending approval by the Legislative Yuan. =Government collaboration= Since 2002, the Ministry of the Interior has invited NATWA to represent women's NGOs in collaborating with other NGOs to evaluate local governments‚Äô executions of the Women's Welfare Policy and Budget. Representatives work with the Ministry of the Interior, touring the island every July to make inspections. They not only supervise policy execution, but also provide advice to local and central governments alike. NATWA works with 10 other women's groups to form an alliance, the Women on Women's Budget Alliance, which supervises the central government's inclusion of gender mainstreaming in the annual budget on women's affairs. The Commission of Women's Rights Promotion and Development (WRPD) heeded the Alliance's advice and included the Alliance in its 2003 annual plan. Ever since, every February, each department of the central government has had to submit a report on how their budget meets the needs of women to WRPD for commissioners and women's NGOs to evaluate. =International collaboration= APEC In 2002, NATWA's then-president Dagmar Yu was a representative of Taiwan at WLN (Women's Leaders Network), part of the annual APEC summits. Her speech was called ‚ÄúBest Practice, financial support to the women micro entrepreneur‚Äîexperience from Taiwan.‚Äù United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (UN NGO CSW) NATWA first participated in the UN NGO CSW conference in 2004. In 2005, NATWA joined 16 women representatives to participate in the UN 49th. NGOCSW, 2005 In 2006, NATWA helped coordinate the participation of Taiwanese women's organizations in the 50th UN NGO CSW conference in 2006. In 2007, NATWA presented a paper at the 51st UN NGO CSW conference on the status of gender equity education in Taiwan. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Starting in 2004, NATWA held annual conventions on the contents of CEDAW and the importance of its ratification in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan. This eventually resulted in the Legislative Yuan ratifying CEDAW's stipulations in 2007. Taiwan's participation in CEDAW is still pending international approval from the United Nations.Taipei Times - archives NATWA works with other women's groups to advocate the practice and the signing of CEDAW in Taiwan. =Educational programs and conventions= In December 2002, NATWA toured 14 counties island-wide to educate local government officials on the Violence in Family Prevention and Sexual Assault Prevention Laws, seeking the practice of these laws on the local level. In 2003, NATWA held conventions on National Women's Rights in both Taipei and Kaohsiung, evaluating the outcome of the women's rights commission in both central and local governments. In 2003, NATWA also hosted a program to encourage women's participation in public affairs. In accordance with gender mainstreaming theories, NATWA held a convention on The Evaluation of Social Welfare‚Äîfrom a Women's and Gendered Perspective on Dec. 12, 2003. At this convention, experts and scholars examined current social welfare policy and laws from a gendered perspective. From 2002-2004, NATWA instituted the ‚ÄúMs. Science Training Program,‚Äù which encouraged gender-neutral educational planning. NATWA brought outstanding women scientists to speak at female high schools, encouraging young women to cross the gender divide in science-related occupations. References 1. 2\\\\.

It is a species of grassland, open woodland and cultivation. This is the only African starling which appears to show affinities with the Asian starlings, particularly the genus Sturnus. Its bare face patches and ability to open-bill feed in grassland are unique amongst African starlings. It is the only member of the genus Creatophora. This common species appears to be extending its range into West Africa, and has also occurred in Arabia, Madagascar and the Seychelles. Description Non- breeding male The wattled starling is 21 cm long, with a short tail and pointed wings. It has mainly grey plumage except for a white rump, and black flight feathers and tail. The breeding male has a white shoulder patch and a distinctive head pattern, with unfeathered yellow skin, and black forehead and throat wattles. The extent to which these seasonal features develop increases with the age of the bird, and some old females may show a weaker version of this plumage. The non-breeding male has a feathered head except for a small yellow patch behind the eye. There are no wattles, but there is a black moustachial stripe. The white shoulder patch is much reduced. The female and juvenile plumages are similar to the non-breeding male, but the flight feathers and tail are brown. The black flight and tail feathers and white rump make this species unmistakable in flight. This species has a range of wheezing or grating calls comparable to those of the common starling, but the most familiar is a wheezing ssreeeeo. Behaviour =Breeding= The wattled starling is a colonial breeder, and may share its colonies with the Cape weaver. It always nests in trees or bushes, including acacias and eucalyptus at between 1 and 10 m above the ground. The globular nest is made from twigs and lined with grass or feathers. The two to five, usually three or four, eggs are pale blue, immaculate or with some brown spots, and are laid before the dome of the nest is completed. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the young. The eggs hatch after 11 days, and the chicks leave the nest in another 13‚Äì16 days. They cannot fly, and suffer heavy predation from large birds of prey. Breeding is linked to an abundant insect supply, and colonies will be abandoned, even with chicks in the nest, if, for example, locust swarms are destroyed by control measures. =Roosting= The wattled starling is highly gregarious and will form large flocks, often with other starlings. Its reedbed roosts, which can be huge, may also be shared. =Feeding= Like other starlings, the wattled starling is an omnivore, taking a wide range of invertebrates seeds and berries, but its diet is mainly insects including many locusts, leading to the local name \\"locust bird\\". It will scavenge at rubbish heaps, and frequently perches on livestock, feeding on insects disturbed by the animals and also removing ectoparasites.

On 1 October 1949, the Department of Drawing and Painting moved from the Technical College at Maradana to the ‚ÄòHeywood‚Äô building at Horton place and was subsequently renamed as the ‚ÄòSchool of Art‚Äô. A diploma in Fine Arts was awarded to students upon the completion of five years of study. Prominent painter and teacher J.D.A.

On 1 October 1953, the Departments of Music and Dance were moved to 21, Albert Crescent in Colombo 7, while the Art and Sculpture courses continued to be conducted at the ‚ÄòHeywood‚Äô Building. Three years after this, in 1956, this institution was once again renamed as the ‚ÄòNational Institute of Arts‚Äôand it was taken under the purview of Ministry of Education and converted into three schools, namely, School of Art and sculpture, School of Music and School of Dancing and Ballet. All schools came under the administration of Dr. Stanley Abeysinghe, Dr. Lionel Edirisinghe and Dr. S. Panibharatha respectively. As a result of the first university Act of 1972, the institution became known as the Institute of Aesthetic studies and got affiliated to the University of Ceylon in 1974. The Institute had 03 Schools and an Academy, namely : School of Art and Sculpture, School of Music and School of Dancing and Ballet, and the Ramanathan Academy of Jaffna. In 1975, the Ramanathan Academy became affiliated with the University of Jaffna. For the first time, in 1978, 63 students were awarded the‚Äô Bachelor of Arts‚Äô degree.

The Governance of the university is under the provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 1985 along with its own by-laws. The university's administration is based upon that of the former University of Ceylon consisting of a dual structure of bodies: the Council (formally known as the University Court which is the governing body) and the Academic Senate (academic affairs). Much of the appointments to officers and faculty are carried out by these bodies, however on the recommendations of the UGC. =Officers of the university= ;Chancellor The Chancellor is the head of the university and awards all degrees, although most duties are carried out by the Vice-Chancellor.

Middlemark (September 16, 1919 ‚Äì September 14, 1989) invented the Rabbit Ears television antenna (dipole antenna) in 1953 in Rego Park, Queens, New York. Marvin P. Middlemark revolutionized how television was watched in the United States, as his Rabbit Ears increased the television signal reception made available to the mass market; this move is considered by many as the single most important reason for the television boom of the late 1950s ‚Äì 1960s.  His inventions  Marvin P. Middlemark held several patents for his inventions; many were lesser known than his famed Rabbit Ears, such as: a water-powered potato peeler (which failed because when done, a large potato was reduced down to the size of a large marble) and a tennis ball rejuvenator that was designed to bring the bounce back to used tennis balls. In the mid-1960s, NASA turned to Middlemark to develop the technology needed that would allow the original Apollo missions to communicate from the Moon Lander to Mission control. Middlemark was able to solve this problem, unfortunately NASA was not able to use the same theoretical principles of his dipole antenna.  Philanthropist  Middlemark donated millions to various educational foundations and trusts in a goal to give under-privileged students the ability to attend college. He was also known as a major giver to the New York area homeless shelters and at the time of his death 15,000 pairs of gloves which he personally ordered from China were delivered as his final act of giving. At the time of his death in 1989, the inventor's mansion in Old Westbury, New York was home to a collection that included two cathedral-size buildings on his property to display his collection of religious stained glass windows and even commissioned pieces displaying the likenesses of Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein. Middlemark was also an animal enthusiast, as his lifetime hobbies included Belmont-winning race horses, nine miniature horses (Middlemark is credited with the introduction of the miniature horses and miniature donkeys into the United States, bringing them in from Argentina), and even a chimpanzee named \\"Josie\\" who lived in an oversized cage in the basement of Middlemark's house and was known to answer the front door of his home and got soused at parties.

This small village is located between Ayer Tawar and Pantai Remis which is 20 km from Ayer Tawar and 14 km from Pantai Remis. Dinding River passes by the village. The majority ethnic group in this village is Chinese (FuZhou). Economy There is a Chinese primary school in the village - SJK (C) Khuen Hean, temple - Guang Fu Gong, Methodist church, mosque, polyclinic, bank (Agro Bank), a few sundry shops and restaurants. Gong piang has sold in there. Most of the residents were rubber tappers before the 1990s. In the recent years, Oil palm plantations are more prevalent due to the lucrativeness of this line of business. The locals hire foreign workers to harvest the crops instead of doing it themselves as they used to decades ago. Many locals accumulated great wealth from harvesting and selling palm oil. The price of land around Changkat Keruing have increased more than ten-fold since 2000. left In addition to other traditional agricultural plantations like mangoes, papayas and coconuts, locals are beginning to look towards fish and prawn farming as another source of income. However, there are several environmental concerns that flow from this practices. Besides, the locals are beginning to invest into the bird's nest market. They do so by constructing 3 to 4 storey high buildings that resembles caves, home of the edible-nest swiftlet. These swiftlets nest in the buildings and their nests are then harvested for sale. Local cuisine People in this town would usually have noodle dishes for breakfast, for instance, noodles in braised soup (Âç§Èù¢), dried Chinese noodles (Âπ≤Êçû), etc. Some other popular Malaysian dishes like asam laksa, curry noodles (ÂíñÂì©Èù¢), and nasi lemak are enjoyed widely by people of this town. High temperatures experienced by the town year round has also made cooling desserts popular amongst the locals.

Taxpayers that care for a qualifying individual are eligible. The purpose of the credit is to allow the taxpayer (or their spouse, if married) to be gainfully employed.Tax Topics - Topic 602 Child and Dependent Care Credit This credit is created by 26 U.S. Code (U.S.C) ¬ß 21, section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Background Federal courts have confirmed that expenses incurred for the care of a dependent, such as babysitting or daycare, while the taxpayer is at work, are not included in deductible business expenses and are not deductible under IRC section 162(a).Smith v. Commissioner, 113 F.2d 114 (2d Cir. 1940). As a result, single-earner households with qualifying individuals are favored over two- earner households with qualifying individuals, as the cost of daycare often outweighs the extra income made in two-earner households.Samuel A. Donaldson, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 4 (2nd Ed. 2007). IRC section 21 serves to lessen this imbalance by allowing a limited credit for certain expenses related to the care of a qualified dependent.Id. General eligibility requirements IRC section 21 uses the term \\"qualifying individual\\" rather than ‚Äúdependent\\" to refer to the types of dependents the care for whom will trigger the credit. Qualifying individuals must be one of four types: 1) Dependents under age thirteen for whom a dependency exemption may be claimed, 2) Dependents of any age who share the same principal place of abode as the taxpayer and are physically or mentally incapable of taking care for themselves, 3) Spouses of any age who share the same principal place of abode as the taxpayer and are physically or mentally incapable of taking care for themselves, or 4) Certain dependent children of divorced parents.26 USC ¬ß21(b)(1) Does the taxpayer \\"maintain the household\\"? The taxpayer must ‚Äúmaintain the household‚Äù for the qualifying individual(s), which means the taxpayer must furnish over one-half of the total cost of maintaining the household. In addition, if the taxpayer is married, both the taxpayer and their spouse must have earned income, unless one spouse was either a full-time student or was physically or mentally incapable of self-care.IRS Tax Topics 602, Child and Dependent Care Credit Does the dependent have the requisite age and relationship? A taxpayer can claim a dependency exemption for a dependent under the age of thirteen if the dependent is the taxpayer's child, sibling, half-sibling, step-sibling or a descendant of any such individual. The qualifying child must not provide more than one-half of his or her own support and must have the same principal place of abode as the taxpayer for more than six months of the year.I.R.C.¬ß 152 (c) =Creditable expenses= Creditable expenses include not only those incurred for actual physical care of the dependent but also ancillary ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù services like meal preparation and cleaning.See IRS Publication 503 for more detailed information. Services outside the home qualify if they involve the care of a qualified child or a disabled spouse or dependent who regularly spends at least eight hours a day in the taxpayer's home. Payments to a relative also qualify for the credit unless the taxpayer claims a dependency exemption for the relative or if the relative is the taxpayer's child and is under age nineteen. No credit is allowed for expenses incurred to send a dependent to an overnight camp. U.S. Master Tax Guide (2005). =Amount of credit / applicable percentage= The credit is a percentage, based on the taxpayer‚Äôs adjusted gross income, of the amount of work-related child and dependent care expenses the taxpayer paid to a care provider.IRS Tax Topics 602, Child and Dependent Care Credit A taxpayer can generally receive a credit anywhere from 20‚àí35% of such costs against the taxpayer‚Äôs federal income tax liability.26 USC ¬ß 21(a)(2). The applicable percentage is inversely correlated to the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer ‚àí the higher the adjusted gross income, the lower the percentage. Id. The credit amount is equal to the applicable percentage, as determined by the taxpayer's adjusted gross income, times the qualified employment expenses paid. Taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $15,000 or less use the highest applicable percentage of 35%. For taxpayers with an adjusted gross income over $15,000, the credit is reduced by one percentage point for each $2,000 of adjusted gross income (or fraction thereof) over $15,000. The minimum applicable percentage of 20% is used by taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes greater than $43,000. Code Sec. 21(a)(2)) The maximum creditable expense available under IRC section 21 is $3000 (or $6000, if taxpayer household contains more than 1 dependent).26 USC ¬ß 21(c). In addition, these dollar amounts must be reduced by the amount any dependent care benefits provided by the taxpayer‚Äôs employer that the taxpayer excludes from their income.IRS Tax Topics 602, Child and Dependent Care Credit For married taxpayers, expenses are limited to the earned income of the lower- earning spouse. If one spouse is not working, no credit is generally allowed. If the non-earning spouse is physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or is a full-time student for more than five months during the year the law assumes there is an earned income. The law assumes for each month of disability or school attendance there is an earned income of $250 if there is one dependent or $500 if there are two or more.

In 1909, Chamanzaminli left for St. Petersburg to enroll in St. Petersburg State University of Architecture and Construction Institute for Civil Engineers but having realized that he would not pass the placement test in mathematics, since he was weak in math and hated it,Numerous references in Chamanzaminli's diaries allude to the fact that he hated math. Chamanzaminli withdrew his application. While in St. Petersburg, he wrote Jannatin gabzi (\\"A Pass to Heaven\\"). In 1910 Chamanzaminli was admitted to the St. Vladimir University in Kiev to study law. When World War I broke out, the students and staff of the university were transferred to Saratov (Volga region of Russia), where Chamanzaminli graduated in 1915. For a while he worked at the judiciary chamber of Saratov and later travelled to Galicia (Eastern Europe). There, reflecting on the February Revolution in Russia, he began Studentlar (\\"Students\\") and \\"In the Year 1917\\". In late 1917, he returned to Kiev to establish an Azerbaijani cultural association. In 1918 he was appointed to represent the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in the Ukrainian People's Republic but there was so much political unrest and turmoil in the region, he was not able to establish an office there. He then moved to Simferopol, Crimea, where he worked for a while as a judiciary advisor. There he published his research work Lithuanian Tatars dedicated to the history and culture of Lipka Tatars. At the same time, he popularized Azeri culture by publishing related articles, especially about literature,Review by Austrian Friedrich Kraelitz-Greifenhorst about Yusif Vazirov's \\"Survey of Azerbaijani Literature (Istanbul).‚Äù Mitteilungen zur osmanischen Geschichte. 1, 1921/22, (1922), pp. 174-175. in the local newspapers. Then in 1919, he was appointed to open the Azerbaijan Embassy in Constantinople, Turkey. He managed only to set it up only briefly for a few months before the Bolsheviks took control of Baku, leaving him without job, salary, guidance as to what to do‚Äîessentially, without a country. Vazirov wrote at least two books that were published while he was in Turkey: (1) \\"A Survey of Azerbaijani Literature\\" (1921), and (2) \\"The History, Geography and Economy of Azerbaijan\\" (1921). Vazirov then left for France to join his younger brother Mir Abdulla, who was studying at the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris and from which he graduated in 1925. In Paris where thousands of √©migr√©s had fled in desperation after the collapse of the Russian Empire, Vazirov was unable to find a job in his field. He tried to get a job driving a taxicab but twice failed the exam. He eventually managed to get a job working in an automobile locomotive factory in the Paris suburb of Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine.Vazirov, Orkhan.Orkhan Vazirov, ‚ÄúAbout My Father Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli‚Äù (Baku: Azerneshr, 1997). He also wrote for a local publication, entitled Les lettres orientales (\\"Eastern Letters\\").  Return to Soviet Baku  After Miri's quite unexpected death,Mir Vazirov, age 31, died within three months after coming down with tuberculosis, later complicated by an appendicitis attack. Source: Letter from Yusif Vazirov to Mir Jafar Baghirov and Joseph Stalin in Orkhan Vazirov's book, \\"About My Father Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli\\" (Baku Azerneshr, 1997), pp. 57-61. In Azeri. Vazirov saw little reason to continue living in Europe. He blamed Miri's death on poverty since they had not had enough money for medical care. Vazirov wrote Stalin: \\"Miri's death left me with no reason not to return to Azerbaijan. I promised myself to defend the new Azerbaijan by embracing education and culture with all my strength. For me, Motherland is like a long-awaited shore after a turbulent voyage at sea.\\"Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli's letter to Stalin on May 20, 1937, which he wrote in desperation, asking for a job after he had been stripped of his membership from the Azerbaijan Writers' Union a few months earlier. Orkhan Vazirov, \\"About My Father Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli,\\" edited by Gilman Ilkin (Baku: Azerneshr, 1997), pp. 57-61. Vazirov resolved, despite serious danger,Vazirov's decision to return to Baku was extremely risky as he had been appointed by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) as Ambassador to Turkey. The ADR had tried to resist the Bolshevik takeover and, consequently, most government officials had been killed. to try to return to his Homeland and work for the strength of the Azerbaijani people. Vazirov applied for permission to return to Azerbaijan SSR from Musabeyov who sought permission from Sergey Kirov for Vazirov's return. Permission was granted in late 1925 and Vazirov returned to Baku in the spring of 1926. Upon his return, he taught languages at Azerbaijani colleges and translated various works of Russian writers into Azeri. In literary circles, he wrote several novels and became known by his penname Chamanzaminli. He took part in compiling the first Russian-Azeri Dictionary (1934).  Stalin's repressions - 1937  In 1937, one of the most notorious years of Stalin's purges, there was an enormous effort on the part of Azerbaijan Writers' Union (as well as other Soviet entities) to \\"purge the ranks.\\" Vazirov was among the 20 or so writers targeted. He tried to defend himself, claiming that he had been one of the most courageous writers fighting against religious abuse during the pre-Soviet days. At the Third Plenum of the Azerbaijan Writers' Union (March 1937), Chairman Seyfulla Shamilov criticized a list of Azerbaijani writers including Vazirov.Adabiyyat Qazeti (Literature Newspaper), March 27, 1937. On June 9, 1937, at least seven articles appeared in the newspaper Adabiyyat, accusing him of being a counter-revolutionary. He was criticized for introducing counter-revolutionary ideas in his antagonist characters, especially in his novels \\"Students\\" and \\"Maiden Spring.\\"Orkhan Vazirov, About My Father Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli (Baku: Nargiz, 2007), p. 51. In Azeri. Realizing the danger he was in, Chamanzaminli burned a large collection of his manuscripts.Personal recollection of his son Orkhan Vazirov (1928-2010) to Editor Betty Blair in 2007, describing how one day when he was about 10 years old, he came in the apartment from playing outside and saw his father stuffing the stove with a pile of manuscripts about four-five inches thick. According to Orkhan, Vazirov had said: \\"One day these manuscripts would have been invaluable.\\" He was stripped of his membership in Azerbaijan's Writers' Union in 1937, which greatly paralyzed his efforts to gain any employment in his field. Eager and willing to work and support his wife Bilgeyiz Ajalova and three children (Orkhan, 1928‚Äì2010), Fikrat (1929‚Äì2004) and Gulara (who was probably born around 1932 and who died shortly after World War II), he wrote a letter to Mir Jafar Baghirov, First Secretary of the Communist Party. A few weeks later, realizing that no answer was forthcoming, in desperation, Chamanzaminli wrote Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, providing a review of his literary career up to that point in his life.Chamanzaminli was 50 years old at the time. His letter to Stalin was dated May 20, 1937. No answer came from Stalin and so he made trips to Ashgabad and Moscow in a desperate attempt to find work but none was to be found. Returning late one night to Baku, he went underground, and remained hidden away for months in his apartment - while neighbors thought he was still in Moscow. At that time he wrote one of his most important novels - \\"Between Two Worlds\\" (meaning Iran and Russia). The novel was never published during his lifetime. Finally, he gained a position as a teacher of the Russian language in Urganj, Uzbekistan in 1938.  Death in the GULAG - Stalin's political prison camps  But authorities eventually managed to track Vazirov down in Urganj in 1940 and they arrested him. He was brought back to Baku for a drawn-out interrogation that lasted six months. Chamanzaminli learned that Bakir Chobanzade, a Crimean Tatar poet, had implicated him.Ziya Bunyadov, \\"Trial of Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli,\\" in ‚ÄúRed Terror‚Äù (Girmizi Terror, Azeri)(Baku: Azernashr, 1993), pp. 199-204 Clearly from photos, it can be seen that Vazirov was tortured during his interrogation period. None of his family members were allowed to visit him during this time but transcripts of the \\"interrogations\\" show that he never admitted to the Soviet government's false accusations, nor did he implicate any fellow Azerbaijanis in an attempt to get his own sentence reduced. Condemned on fabricated charges, Vazirov was sentenced to eight years of labor camps, which he served at Unzhlag at Sukhobezvodnaya railway station, Gorky Oblast, Russia. He died of malnutrition, disease, and heart break, three years after his arrest in January 1943. Authorship of Ali and Nino Extensive researchResearch was carried out by Azerbaijan International staff over a six- year period (2004-2010). It included studying documents in 10 languages (Azeri, Russian, English, German, French, Italian, Georgian, Turkish, Persian and Swedish). Documents were gathered from major archives and libraries in Baku, Tbilisi, Vienna, Berlin, Istanbul and Los Angeles. by Azerbaijan International magazine into the authorship of the novel Ali and Nino, which was published under the pseudonym Kurban Said, points to the following conclusions: (1) The core author of the novel \\"Ali and Nino\\" is Azerbaijani writer and statesman Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli (1887‚Äì1943) as evidenced from the content of his diaries, autobiographical essays, short stories and articles.\\"101 Reasons Why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of \\"Ali and Nino\\" (pp. 262-333). Also \\"Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of 'Ali and Nino' (pp. 52-137) in \\"Who Wrote Azerbaijan's Most Famous Novel \\"Ali and Nino\\" Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4. However, others argue that Lev Nussimbaum, who wrote under the pen name of Essad Bey, was the exclusive author.Reiss, Tom. \\"The Orientalist: Solving the Mystery of a Strange and Dangerous Life\\" (NY: Random House, 2005) Some even dismiss the possibility that Chamanzaminli could possibly have authored this novel as it was first published in German, a language they insist he did not know. However, archival documents indicate that Yusif Vazirov did reasonably well in his German class in high school.Yusif Vazirov's grades in German class at Baku Realni High School for the two school terms (1907-1908) were 3 / 5 (5, being the highest mark possible) in the oral component and 4 / 4 in the written component. See Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives: Fund 315, List 1, Case 864, Page 15. Photo published in \\"Secrets in the Archives: Lev Nussimbaum's Early School Records in Baku,\\" in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), p. 158. Research was carried out by Konul Samadova and Sevinj Mehdizade Seyidova in 2007. However, to discredit Chamanzaminli's authorship simply on the grounds that he didn't know German is to ignore the political crisis in the 1920s and 1930s between world wars when hundreds of thousands of foreign refugees flocked to European capitals to escape the economic collapse of four of the world's six empires (Russian, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and German). In their new setting, displaced intellectuals lost their reading public and were often at the mercy of literary brokers to get their works published. When Chamanzaminli left Paris and returned to Baku (which by that time had come under Soviet rule), one of his first short stories (1927)‚Äî\\"Notebook of a Refugee\\"‚Äîdescribed the poverty-stricken conditions that refugee authors experienced, which forced them to accept 25 percent of whatever the European literary agents received.Yusif Vazirov, \\"Notebook of a Refugee\\" (\\"Bir Gachginin Daftarindan\\"), in Selected Works of Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli. Vol. 1 (Baku: Azerbaijan SSR, Publishing House of the Academy of Sciences, 1966). (2) The fingerprints of Lev Nussimbaum (1905‚Äì1942), who wrote under the penname of Essad Bey, can be traced in the folkloric and legendary material in the novel (although much of it is neither culturally or ethnically reliable). Identical descriptions of such material can be traced to his earlier works as he had a tendency to repeat himself in subsequent works.Armin Wegner, a contemporary of Lev Nussimbaum, wrote in his diaries in September 1942 that Lev was \\"a typical literary swindler, gifted but irresponsible for he invariably made four or five books out of one,\\" in Gerhard H√∂pp, \\"Mohammed Essad Beg Nur Orient f√ºr Europ√§er? Asien Afrika Lateinamericka 25:1 (Berlin Akademie Verlag, 1997), p. 90.\\"'Cut and Paste' Author: Essad Bey's Fingerprints in 'Ali and Nino',\\" in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), pp. 230-251. Lev's lack of knowledge of the Azerbaijani language also contributed to his tendency to further distort historical record which is also evident in the novel. Archival documents indicate that Lev failed the one Azerbaijani language class that he took in high schoolDuring the school year of 1918-1919 when Lev Nussimbaum was in Grade 3 at Men's Gymnasium No. 2 in Baku, he failed his Azerbaijani class, receiving a mark of 2 out of possible 5. Note that he was also enrolled in Russian, German and French at the time. Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives, Fund 392, List 1, Case 470, Page 13. Photo of document published in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), p. 153. Research was carried out by Konul Samadova and Sevinj M. Seyidova in 2007. Another disadvantage was that Lev did not know the Arabic script, the official alphabet at that time in Azerbaijan.Essad Bey's inscription in a book gifted to Baron Omar Rolf Ehrenfels in 1937 (the year in which Ali and Nino was first published) indicates that he did not know how to write the Azerbaijani Arabic script. Of the four words in the inscription, all are misspelled including (1) his own name (Essad Bey), (2) the country Azerbaijan, and (3) the city Vienna. This book \\"Der Islamische Orient\\" is housed in the Ehrenfels' castle in Lichtenau, Austria. A photo of the book and Essad Bey's inscription is published in \\"Frequently Asked Questions About the Authorship of Ali and Nino,\\" in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), pp. 110-111. (3) Essad Bey took materials about Tbilisi and Persia directly from Georgian writer Grigol Robakidze (1882‚Äì1962) (\\"Das Schlangenhemd,\\" Snake Slough, 1928).Injia, Tamar. \\"Ali and Nino: Literary Robbery\\" (IM Publishers, Norwalk, Conn. 2009). Research shows that Essad Bey personally knew Robakidze.Research by Georgian historian Dr. Zaza Aleksidze reveals that Lev Nussimbaum (Essad Bey) knew Robakidze who immigrated to Germany where Essad Bey was living. (4) Austrian Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels (1894‚Äì1982) registered the work with German authorities, claiming that the pseudonym Kurban Said belonged to her,Deutsches Bucher Verzeichnis (German Index of Books) and Duetscher Gesamtkatalog (German Collective Catalog) under New Titles, published between 1935-1939, page 5336. See photo in \\"Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of 'Ali and Nino,'\\" FAQ No. 19 (Azerbaijan International magazine, Vol. 15:2-4, pp. 55-57. though evidence of her involvement in the actual writing of the novel has yet to be proven. Plaque in Azerbaijani (Cyrillic script), which dates back to the Soviet period reads: \\"Prominent Azerbaijani writer Y.V. Chamanzaminli (1887-1943) lived and created his works here.\\" The apartment was located at 20 Sardarov Street in Baku, Azerbaijan. This is written in the initial Russian- based Cyrillic, and not the Serbian-based script used in Azerbaijan until the end of communism. 20 Sardarov Street, Baku, Azerbaijan - last residence of Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli Sardarov Street, Baku.

Orkhan Vazirov (1928-2010) with the collection of literary works written by his father Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli.  Pen names  Chamanzaminli is one of Yusif Vazirov's pennames. He adopted it in remembrance of the kindness of three brothers from a small remote village in Iran called \\"Chaman Zamin\\" which means \\"green or verdant meadow\\". In desperation, the brothers had come north to Shusha to escape the terrible drought in the Tabriz region of Iran at the end of 19th century. Vazirov's father had provided them with a place to stay. In turn, after he died and Yusif himself fell desperately ill with typhoid in 1906, the brothers came to his rescue. Vazirov made a vow that if he ever became a writer he would adopt the name of their village in gratitude.Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli, ‚ÄúMy Life‚Äù in Works (Articles, Essays and Memoirs) (Baku: Academy of Science, 1977). Vol. 3, pp. 312-319. Vazirov began using the Chamanzaminli penname in his literary works at least as early as 1911.He referred to himself as \\"Ali Khan Chamanzaminli\\" in the 1911 publication of the folk tale Malik Mammad (Baku: Kaspiy Press). A copy is now available in Arabic script on microfilm in the Akhundov National Library, Baku, Azerbaijan. See photo of cover page in \\"Names: 101 Reasons Why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of Ali and Nino, Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4, p. 301. When Vazirov returned to Soviet Azerbaijan in 1926, he again took up the name‚Äîthis time as \\"Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli\\". However, literary works that are kept at the Baku Institute of Manuscripts show that Yusif Vazirov used at least 15 different pseudonyms to protect his identity starting as early as 1904 when he was only 17 years old. Often the names he chose hold symbolic meaning, such as \\"Badbakht\\" (Unlucky One), \\"Hagg Tarafdari\\" (Protector of Justice), \\"Musavi\\" (Equality), \\"Stradayushiy\\" (Sufferer), \\"Sarsam,\\" (Crazy One).Blair, Biography: Lives of Two Writers: Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli and Lev Nussimbaum,\\" in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4, p. 38. In 1907, Vazirov, 20, wrote a Letter to the Editor of the satirical magazine \\"Molla Nasraddin\\" attacking the Muslim clergy in his hometown of Shusha. As a result, he received death threats. In his diaries, Vazirov acknowledges how foolish he was not to have used a pseudonym.Yusif Vazirov's Diaries: October 5, 1907, in Leyla Majidgizi Imamaliyeva, \\"Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli: Diaries, Minutes for Myself.\\" Scientific Editor: Dr. Tofig Huseinoghlu (Baku: Azernashr, 2001), pp. 94-110.

A right-hander, Gentry stood tall and weighed . Minor league career Born in Daisy Station, near Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Gentry first pitched in organized baseball as part of the company team when he worked for Hanes Hosiery in Winston-Salem. From 1939 to 1941, he played minor league ball for Landis in the North Carolina State League, Fulton, Kentucky in the Kitty League (where he struck out 167 batters), and Winston-Salem in the Piedmont League. In 1942 and 1943, Gentry pitched for the Buffalo Bisons in the International League. Gentry had good speed on his fastball but lacked control. He struck out 80 batters in 1942, but walked 122. Gentry followed in 1943 with the best season of his career. He pitched an 11-inning no-hitter for the Bisons on Easter Sunday and finished the season with 20 wins and a 2.65 earned run average. He led the league in innings pitched (285), strikeouts (184) and walks (143). A promising start with the Tigers: 1943‚Äì1944 Gentry's performance in 1943 won him a promotion to the big leagues in September 1943. He went 1‚Äì3 for the Tigers in 4 starts, but lost two games by the score of 1‚Äì0. So his 1‚Äì3 record could have just as easily been 3‚Äì1 with any run support from a Tigers batting order depleted by the war. In 1944, Gentry won a spot in the Tigers' starting rotation, along with Hal Newhouser and Dizzy Trout. Gentry ended the 1944 season a distant third in wins with 12, behind Newhouser's 29 wins and Trout's 27 wins. Gentry continued to have problems with his control as he led the American League in walks with 108 and was 3rd in the league in earned runs allowed. Toward the end of the 1944 season, Gentry found his stride. He won several games in the pennant stretch, as the Tigers narrowly lost the pennant to the St. Louis Browns. On September 17, 1944, Gentry narrowly missed a no-hitter against the Indians. In the bottom of the 9th inning, with the Tigers ahead 3‚Äì0, Lou Boudreau hit an infield single that deflected off Gentry. Ken Keltner followed with a two-out double, and Gentry would up with a 2-hit shutout. Even in the best game of his career, however, Gentry had problems with his control. Gentry walked the bases loaded in the 4th inning before striking out the final batter. Detroit manager Steve O'Neill later said he had been one pitch away from pulling Gentry in the 4th inning. After the 4th inning, Gentry retired 14 consecutive batters. Detroit News sportswriter H. G. Salsinger wrote that in the last 6 weeks of the season Gentry \\"looked to be a certain winner. It would have surprised no one who watched him throw in those last six weeks if he had turned in 20 victories.\\" Gentry holds out in 1945 After his performance in 1944, Gentry believed he was entitled to a $1,000 raise. Detroit's general manager Jack Zeller refused, and Gentry opted to hold out. The hold out lasted the entire 1945 season. Gentry reportedly offered to sign in August, but Zeller felt Gentry was out of shape and told him to stay home. According to a Detroit News article dated August 8, 1945, Gentry had \\"demanded the same salary the club was paying Harold Newhouser, who won 29 and lost 9 games last year. The club did not think Ruffus worth as much as Harold, but Ruffus insisted in his demands and said that if the club did not meet them he would stay home. He stayed home. He's tired of staying home but the club thinks he got tired too late to do the team any good.\\" The holdout ended up being costly to both Gentry and Zeller. Gentry missed the opportunity to pitch for a team that won the American League pennant and the 1945 World Series against the Chicago Cubs. The holdout also cost Zeller. Having refused to give Gentry a $1,000 raise, he found himself short of pitching during the 1945 pennant drive. He ended up purchasing three pitchers late in the season for a total of $40,000. Zeller later stated that refusing the extra $1,000 to Gentry was his \\"biggest mistake as general manager.\\"http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v;=l&bid;=1682&pid;=5016 A gunshot wound to the pitching hand derails a comeback In 1946, Gentry signed with the Tigers but pitched in only 3 innings, giving up 7 walks and accumulating a 15.00 earned run average. Sent back to the minors, any hopes of a comeback were derailed when Gentry accidentally discharged his gun while cleaning it. The resulting shot mangled the index finger on Gentry's pitching hand. Despite the injury, Gentry tried to come back with a noticeably crooked index finger in 1947 and again in 1948. He pitched only 1/3 of an inning in 1947 and 6 innings in 1948 for the Tigers. Gentry never won a major league ball game after his 1945 holdout. Life after baseball After retiring from baseball, Gentry returned to North Carolina and worked as a brick mason and stonemason.

It was released for the PlayStation 3 on November 24, 2010 in Europe and North America, and November 25, 2010 in Japan and Australasia, and is the fifth main installment and the tenth overall in the Gran Turismo video game series. It was preceded by the Prologue version and is the first main entry of the series to be released for the PlayStation 3. The game marks the first entry in the series with online races with support for up to 16 players. A damage model has been included with variations of damage depending on the car. Over 1,000 cars, 29 different locations, 77 different tracks, and a track generator are available in the game. Dynamic time and weather effects make their debut in the series. World Rally Championship, NASCAR and Super GT licenses are utilized for the first time in the Gran Turismo series.http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y102/Digital- Nitrate/Games/PS3/GT5/100_7233-1.jpg Gran Turismo 5 was well-received critically and a commercial success, becoming the second best-selling PlayStation 3 game, the best-selling PlayStation 3 exclusive and the second best-selling game in the series with over 10 million copies sold. The game also won multiple awards, and turned some players into real-life professional racing drivers with the GT Academy competition. Gameplay =New features= An example of both damage rendering and overturning, features new to Gran Turismo Gran Turismo 5 is the first game in the franchise to provide a damage model, with variations of damage depending on the car. The game also features weather effects, which are available on certain circuits. Optional stereoscopic-3D resolution and karting found a place in the game. Furthermore, new visual effects have been introduced, including dynamic skid marks, dust and the ability for drivers to flash their headlights. A course editor which allows the player to create new circuits by using tools that randomly generate track-parts according to certain player-selected specifications, including the number of corners, the time of day and the number of sectors. There are a variety of themes the player can choose from to act as a base for each circuit design. Themes also have an effect on track length and highest elevation. The physics are significantly revised compared with Gran Turismo 4. Cars no longer instantly turn-in but realistically must load up the outside wheel first, and destabilizing effects (such as under braking) have greater influence. Gran Turismo 5 is the first game in the franchise to include both mechanical and external damage modelling, including a real-time deformation engine that processes model deformation according to the speed and angle of impact. It is also possible to overturn cars for the first time in the series. The cars in GT5 are separated into \\"premium\\" and \\"standard\\" vehicles. Premium vehicles are more detailed and include a fully-detailed cockpit view, while standard vehicles are less detailed. Standard cars initially could not receive aftermarket wheels, however, as of the version 2.02 update this is no longer the case. Gran Turismo 2 previously included damage, but was limited to mechanical failures only. =Tracks= Gran Turismo 5 allows players to drive 31 different locations or \\"scenery\\" and 81 different track layouts (the previous iteration in the main numbered series, Gran Turismo 4, included 51 tracks total). Dunsfold Aerodrome, located in the United Kingdom ‚Äì the test track of the British automotive television show Top Gear ‚Äì is included in the game. The playable demo of Gran Turismo 5 at Gamescom 2009 featured the Tokyo Route 246 track, seen in previous incarnations of the game. Various real-life circuits return from previous games in the series. These include (among others) N√ºrburgring, Circuit de la Sarthe, Tsukuba Circuit, Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca and Suzuka Circuit. New real-life circuits included in the game include (among others) Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Monza Circuit, Daytona International Speedway and two new Rome and Madrid city circuits. Many fictional circuits return from previous games in the series including 'Trial Mountain', 'Deep Forest Raceway' and 'Autumn Ring'. An official list of all tracks available in the game has been released by Polyphony Digital.  Downloadable tracks  The \\"Track Pack\\" downloadable content, includes Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (with weather change) and Kart Space I/II. On January 17, 2012, Polyphony Digital released the \\"Speed Test Pack\\" that includes \\"Special Stage Route X\\". In June, Twin Ring Motegi returned to the series as DLC after the 2012 GT Academy. =Vehicles= Customization in GT5 ranges from engine tune-ups to body effects to improve aerodynamics, as shown on this Dodge Challenger SRT-8 Gran Turismo 5 provides a total of 1,089 cars. Ferrari, Lamborghini and Bugatti make their first main release appearance in the franchise. The new \\"gullwing\\" Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG appeared, along with the Ferrari 458 Italia and the Lexus LFA supercar. McLaren also made their first appearance as a native manufacturer with the inclusion of the McLaren F1 road car, the F1 GTR race edition, and the MP4-12C road car. It is the first main release in the series to feature licensed Formula One cars, with the Ferrari F2007 and F10 included. Le Mans spec cars made a return appearance. Hybrid cars such as the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight are included in the game. The series' creator Kazunori Yamauchi mentioned that the latest hybrid and electric cars would be included, including the Tesla Roadster (2008) and Mitsubishi i-MiEV. At Gamescom 2010, it was also revealed that GT5 would include the Jaguar XJ13 race car prototype, as well as the Ferrari 330 P4 and the Ford Mark IV race cars, and as the developers put it, \\"will allow players to create the race that never came to be\\", since the XJ13 program was canceled before the car was ready for competition. Additionally, in association with Red Bull Racing, the development team worked on a new prototype car called the \\"X2010 Prototype\\" which was designed with the idea of, \\"If you built the fastest racing car on land, one that throws aside all rules and regulations, what would that car look like, how would it perform, and how would it feel to drive?\\" This car was worked on by Polyphony Digital and Red Bull's aerodynamics expert, Adrian Newey, and is one of the cars in the game. Up to 16 cars or 32 karts would be able to race on track at once whereas previous installments allowed only six cars per race max. Polyphony Digital released the official vehicle list which also shows which vehicles were be standard or premium. The cars in GT5 are separated into two categories, premium and standard. Premium cars are highly detailed and thus have high polygon counts, high texture resolution, feature headlights capable of high and low beams, detailed interior camera views, and detailed damage models. Premium cars also have working windshield wipers which are operated on tracks with rain or snow. Standard cars have lower polygon counts and texture resolution, standard headlights and basic damage modelling. After the Spec 2.0 update they feature simplified interior camera views. For open-topped cars, they have a functioning steering wheel and working gauges. Around 25% of all cars in the game fall into the \\"premium\\" category. Classic sports cars are also a distinctive feature in GT5. Classics such as the Triumph Spitfire, Mini Marcos and Alfa Romeo Spider have also been added. Alongside this, some commercial vehicles have unusually been added to the game. Vehicles such as the Volkswagen Type 2 and the Volkswagen Schwimmwagen have been added to the game.  Downloadable cars  In the Spec 2.0 update, there is the #71 Schulze Motorsport Nissan GT-R which Yamauchi drove in the 2011 24 Hours of N√ºrburgring and the new stock car designs of the 2011 NASCAR Season. In the new \\"Racing Car Pack\\" DLC, there are 14 new touring cars that are based on cars in the game like the Honda CR-Z and the Toyota Prius. Also, there is a newer version of the Red Bull X2010 called the X2011. On December 20, 2011, Polyphony Digital released \\"Car Pack 2\\" which features 2 new Volkswagen vehicles, the Golf R and Scirocco R, the new 2012 Nissan GT-R Black Edition and the 2011 Mini Cooper S. On January 9, 2012, PD has released a concept video for the upcoming Acura NSX for the North American International Auto Show. However, Kazunori did not state any information about the NSX's DLC release. The week after, Polyphony released \\"Car Pack 3\\" together with the \\"Speed Test Pack\\" which includes the Lamborghini Aventador, Aston Martin V12 Vantage, Nissan Leaf, Mini Countryman, Volkswagen Beetle and a Premium Jaguar XJR-9. In June, a free DLC release added a new car: the Scion FR-S, a variant model of the Toyota 86 and Scion's first vehicle to appear as a premium model. On September 25, update 2.08 brought 3 new cars: the Honda Weider HSV-010 '11 Super GT car, the Subaru BRZ (another variant of the Toyota 86), and the Nissan GT-R N24 GT Academy '12 car, which participated in the 2012 24 Hours N√ºrburgring., On 28 November, the new 2014 Chevrolet Corvette C7 Prototype was released as a free DLC. On January 15, 2013, the Chevrolet Corvette C7 Final Prototype was released as another free DLC. Development The game was first revealed at E3 2005 under the name Vision Gran Turismo. This was not GT5 but simply Gran Turismo 4 (for the PlayStation 2) with more cars on track and PC- rendered footage. The PlayStation 3 would not be released until November 11, 2006, and with no Gran Turismo game in the console's launch line-up. Various bits of information and news was revealed about the game from then on, but it was not for another three years that the public got a chance to have a proper look at GT5. At Sony's E3 2009 Press Conference, a trailer for Gran Turismo 5 was shown, revealing the inclusion of Super GT, NASCAR and WRC but no release date was revealed. Yamauchi said that \\"We've actually reached a point where we can probably release [GT5] anytime, except that you can also keep working as long as you want to as well, it's just a matter of timing\\". Yamauchi later explained that \\"Deciding a release date for a game is always difficult, as it‚Äôs not something I can decide on my own. The agreement on a date comes between various parties at Sony, and it‚Äôs not necessarily a date I would be hoping for. March would've been too early. We could have produced the game in time to make that deadline, but the finished product wouldn't have had everything that I wanted to include\\". Sony Computer Entertainment has certain control over the release dates of their games, which could be one of the contributing factors delaying Gran Turismo 5. Gran Turismo 5 was shown off extensively at E3 2010 including a new trailer, a North and Latin American release date, playable demos on the show floor and various private press conferences revealing new information about the game. Alongside the original release, two collector's editions were released; one featuring some extra bonus content and the other, more expensive option containing extra paraphernalia such as further reading on car racing. Overall, Gran Turismo 5 took more than five years to complete, with a total cost estimated at approximately $60 million, although Polyphony Digital did release four other games during this period. The first game in the series had also taken five years. Yamauchi has expressed the difficulty of developing for the PlayStation 3, specifically mentioning how the extensively different (at the time) architecture of the Cell processor had made programming extremely challenging and time-consuming. This greater than expected difficulty to program for the Cell processor is speculated by some people to also be part of the reasons why Gran Turismo 5 was delayed a number of times. All downloadable contents were removed from sale on April 30, 2014. The online servers were shut down on May 30 the same year. On April 29, Sony announced the final online event for Gran Turismo 5, which started on April 30 and ended with the shutdown of the online servers. Players were awarded with five cars in Gran Turismo 6 for participating in the event. =Time Trial Demo and 2010 GT Academy= Bravia at the 2011 Taipei Game Show The GT5 Time Trial Demo was released on December 17, 2009 on the PlayStation Network; it was only playable while the user was signed into the PlayStation Network. It was not so much a demo of GT5 itself, but as the first part of the 2010 GT Academy, with the fastest drivers from the time trial eventually getting the chance to drive a real racing car in a real racing series. Nevertheless, it showed what progress had been made since Polyphony Digital's previous game, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in terms of graphics, physics and other aspects of game-play and design. It featured stock and tuned versions of the Nissan 370Z. The track featured in the demo was the Indianapolis GP circuit, which is new to the Gran Turismo series. This demo was praised for its graphics and updated physics, however it has been criticized for its stiff camera, and confusion over what aspects of the final game the demo represents. The Time Trial demo is no longer playable since the 2010 GT Academy was finished. =2011 GT Academy= On November 16, 2010, it was revealed that the GT Academy would return for a third year, this time for drivers in the USA. GT Academy is a three-phase competition with the winner being trained and enrolled as a professional racing driver in preparation for a major race event next year. A reality TV show on sports channel SPEED chronicled the competition. The preliminary virtual rounds tested of driving skills in Gran Turismo 5 using pre-selected Nissan vehicles and all entrants would receive free digital content for playing. The top 32 drivers were then invited to a live GT5 National Finals, with the 16 leading players taken to the GT Academy Boot Camp. The second round of the competition was scrapped due to the widespread use of cheating. Sony and Polyphony Digital have confirmed that the Gran Turismo 5 Academy events would be available for European players to participate in from March 4, 2011. =Song Track Naming Competition= At E3 2010, a new trailer was shown revealing various aspects about GT5 including a release date. The song used for the trailer was by Japanese composer Daiki Kasho; many fans wanted to know the name of the song, but it was untitled. Polyphony Digital recognised this and started a competition open to all fans around the world, to submit a name for the song. The winner would have their name immortalised in Gran Turismo 5s credits and their title become the official name of the music track. The winner was chosen by Yamauchi out of 5,444 entries: it was \\"50UL 0N D!SPLAY\\" (a stylised form of \\"Soul On Display\\") submitted by a fan from Argentina. =Other peripherals= Kazunori Yamauchi promised that Gran Turismo 5 could have some compatibility with the PlayStation Portable version. He stated, \\"we‚Äôre going to make it so that you can actually export the cars for the PSP version into Gran Turismo 5, so you can export your garage\\". The game was reported by media in September 2009 to allow head tracking using the PlayStation Eye, though no official confirmation came in the following months. This feature would allow the player to move their head naturally while sitting down, upright, and have the view around the 3D cockpit change accordingly. Officially announced in conjunction with Toyota in January 2010 was a GPS-based device which, when loaded into the game, would create a 'ghost' lap of a run through a race circuit in real life if equipped for data recording, allowing someone to view or race against their real life driving. This became available for tracks which exist in real life, but there was no information on which or how many circuits in total would support the feature. =Multiple screens= The game supports up to six different views that can be presented on six or more PS3 consoles. Two left views, two right views, server view (front with dials), and a front view without any dials all can be duplicated on an extra PS3 console if they are on the same LAN. =Updates= The game has been updated and expanded several times in its lifespan. Many of the updates have improved the multiplayer racing, including weight and power restrictions on which cars can be driven in an online session, a car performance rating system, handicaps such as ballast and engine restriction, mechanical damage, and the ability to use the built-in course maker in online multiplayer races. Physics updates have not been documented in the update logs, however many users have noted changes to the physics once updates are installed. Other updates have included additional events, an online car dealership, removal of the copy protection for saved games, friend rankings, and various adjustments to the rewards and restrictions in the game. The final update (v2.16) was released on May 31, 2014 which permanently disabled all online features such as online play and Seasonal events. On July 21 another patch (v2.17) was released, which removed the online requirement for installing the downloadable content after the servers went offline. =Spec 2.0 and DLC= A new update for Gran Turismo 5, called Spec 2.0 was released on October 11, 2011, featuring 11 new NASCAR vehicles, a new downloadable opening movie (no longer available after the server shutdown in 2014), the ability to save during endurance races, weather intensity control and AI improvements. Along with the release of Spec 2.0, Yamauchi also announced that four DLC packs would be available on October 18. These packs featured 15 new vehicles, two new tracks, 20 new driver costumes and 100 new paint colors. The packs were released on October 18, while the North American release was delayed until October 25. PD stated that all following DLC packs would be released in a two-month time frame. * A second car pack was released on December 20, 2011, that features four new vehicles: the Mini Cooper S, Volkswagen Golf VI R, Volkswagen Scirocco R and the Nissan GT-R Black Edition. * A third downloadable-content pack was released on January 17, 2012, featuring the track \\"Route X\\" and a third car pack including Nissan Leaf G 2011, Aston Martin V12 Vantage 2010, Volkswagen Beetle 1200 1966, Jaguar XJR-9 LM Racecar 1988, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 2011, and the Mini Cooper S Countryman (R60) 2011. * GT Academy was released on May 1, 2012 as a free standalone title on the PlayStation Network as a collaboration between Nissan and Polyphony Digital. A key feature was the ability to unlock exclusive \\"academy cars\\" for use in Gran Turismo 5 as well as a special racing suit for anyone who completed all challenges. The rewards for the game were handed out on July 4. * A fourth downloadable-content pack featuring Twin Ring Motegi along with a free Scion FR-S was released on 26 June 2012. * A fifth pack added three individual cars: a Honda Weider HSV-010 '11 Super GT car, the Subaru BRZ, and the Nissan GT-R N24 GT Academy '12 race car. It was released on September 25, 2012. * A free DLC with Corvette C7 Test Prototype was released on 28 November 2012. * A free DLC with the Corvette C7 Final Prototype was released on January 15, 2013, revealing the Corvette C7's body and interior. * A new cumulative package which contains all the aforementioned content was released sometime in Q2 2015. As of today, all downloadable content has been permanently removed from PlayStation Store. =Online play= Gran Turismo 5 also featured an online mode. Players would meet in 'lounges' or 'race rooms' and give away (and/or share) cars, car parts and trained AI drivers to friends. They could also share game pictures and designed tracks. All online activity closed on May 20, 2014, but a special event was held from April 30 to May 30 that allowed players to unlock five additional cars for Gran Turismo 6. Marketing Gran Turismo 5 promotion at Paris Games Week 2010 Gran Turismo 5's marketing campaign started on November 18, 2010 with a TV commercial featuring the fictional marketing character Kevin Butler as part of Sony Computer Entertainment's It Only Does Everything advertising campaign for their video game products in North America. The commercial depicts Butler as the 'VP of Add More Awesome' explaining how he made Gran Turismo 5 \\"more awesome\\" by adding more features that were previously thought impossible. At the October 2010 Australian International Motor Show, Toyota hosted a 24-hour PlayStation 3 GT5 endurance race, a recreation of the 24 Hours N√ºrburgring, with a total of 48 drivers split into two teams, racing virtual interpretations of the Toyota FT-86 G Sports Concept for a full day and night. On November 14, it was revealed that Sony had teamed with Swiss watchmaker Tissot to host the official countdown timer for the launch of Gran Turismo 5. To promote the relationship, Tissot gave away one customized, GT5 edition Tissot PRS 516, every day up until the release date. In February 2011, a real version of the Polyphony Digital-designed Citro√´n GT was floated by the Rialto Bridge in Venice, recreating a location in Gran Turismo 4. Release After promising that GT5 would be released in 2010 after missing its initial March 2010 Japanese release date, Sony announced at E3 2010 that Gran Turismo 5 would be officially launched in North and Latin America on November 2, in Europe and Japan on November 3 and in Australia on November 4, 2010, but was later revealed that the game would not meet its November release date and would instead be released later in the \\"holiday season\\". Sony producer Taku Imasaki said that the reason for the delay was that series creator Kazunori Yamauchi and Polyphony Digital want to \\"make certain they are creating the perfect racing experience\\". In addition, the Sony spokesman Makiko Noda said that the reason of the delay was due to production reasons. Later, Sony stated that the game would be released \\"before Christmas\\" [2010]. The actual reason for the delay turned out to be on the production side. Gran Turismo 5 missed its production window by three days. Kazunori Yamauchi publicly apologized via his Twitter account and explained that with such a complex game, a lot has to be ironed out. He finished his Tweet with, \\"Wait a little longer\\". It was later claimed by a Blu-ray forum moderator that the delay was due to Sony's decision to release the game under the newer 3.50 SDK firmware standard (to combat piracy), rather than 3.41 as originally intended. While at the Specialty Equipment Market Association Show on November 2, 2010, Yamauchi confirmed to automotive blog Jalopnik that GT5 had entered final production for release. After weeks of speculation, it was officially announced that Gran Turismo 5 would be released on November 24 for Asia, North America and Europe and November 25 for Japan and Australia. =Retail editions= TGS 2009, featuring a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Alongside the standard edition of the game, there are nine other versions of the game exclusive to certain countries and/or regions around the world.

This version includes the original retail version of the game, along with the Spec 2.0 update already installed, plus vouchers for the game's DLC that was released in 2011. This version also has an alternative box art: Instead of the Le Mans Red Mercedes SLS AMG, the same car is now painted silver, and the inside cover features two screenshots of the Red Bull X2011 Race Car (which is featured as DLC, itself being an evolved, faster form of the Red Bull X2010 featured in the game as well), which can be flipped and used as the front box cover. *A new edition of the game which was released on 26 September 2012 - The Gran Turismo 5: Academy edition is the latest version of the original GT5 game. It included all the functionality updates and new content that has been made available since the launch.

Reception Gran Turismo 5 received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The driving physics of GT5 received high praise. Car and Driver stated that \\"its physics model is extremely realistic. The behavior of the cars is startlingly faithful to their real-life counterparts, so they respond accordingly to poor driving and when you miss critical braking and turn-in points\\". Destructoid commented that \\"Turning and braking feel incredibly natural. You get a real sense of how slamming on the brakes throws the car's weight forward. Handling actually feels like car handling, and not some once-removed, through-a-game-controller attempt\\". IGN declared that \\"its handling model proudly restores Gran Turismo upon the driving throne\\". The amount of cars, tracks and features was praised. GamePro called it \\"an amazingly deep racing game that offers an almost mind- boggling amount of racing challenges, cars, tracks and features\\". Destructoid stated that \\"the numbers that Sony and Polyphony Digital have been throwing at us don't even begin to cover how vast the game is. The game's GT Mode has so many menus and sub-menus that it took me a full workday to completely go through them all, and that's not even counting a separate arcade mode, a track maker, a video collection and much more. It's every bit of the racing world all in one place, on one disc. The word 'comprehensive' doesn't even feel big enough\\". The inclusion of a track generator, karts, licensed World Rally Championship and NASCAR vehicles was also received positively, as was the new dynamic time and weather effects. The addition of online racing was positively received. The online races were credited for being smooth without any noticeable lag and for not showing any drop off in quality, as well as for providing fun racing. GamePro concluded that the \\"superb online mode gives the game incredible longevity\\". The graphics received positive reviews with reviewers praising the lighting effects as well as interior and exterior details of premium cars, stating that Photo Mode showed off their detailed graphical design very well. CGMagazine claimed that the detail of the games track's combined with the weather effects add up to \\"some breathtaking driving experiences with sunset on the horizon and dirt being kicked up around your car, or rain drops hitting the windshield in cockpit view with uncanny realism\\". Destructoid commented positively on the lightning, weather and particle effects, stating that \\"watching snow blow onto and over the windshield was so lovely that it was almost distracting. The way a nighttime fog soaks up headlights looked impossibly realistic. Streetlights shine on a glossy, wet road, and later, raindrops streak by as you hit 200 mph. In the desert, dust kicks up in a rally race. High beams catch the dust, with the tops of the surrounding trees barely lit by the setting sun\\". The detail of standard cars were criticized as they lacked fully detailed cockpit views, looked like up-scaled versions taken from Gran Turismo 4 and did not keep up to the level of detail found in the premium models. GT5 has been criticized for frame-rate drops and screen tearing. The problems are most noticeable when many cars are on screen with rain or smoke visible. The newly included damage feature received criticism for having limited effect on car performance (however a later update added the ability to \\"turn on\\" full damage and tire/fuel depletion). The AI was also criticized for still making CPU-drivers brake unexpectedly and not being aware of the player's car on the track, just as in previous games in the series. IGN called it \\"the series' now trademark zombie A.I.\\". The game's sound was praised. Arnold Katayev, reviewer of PSX Extreme, stated that \\"Gran Turismo 5 actually sounds fantastic. Having sampled a number of cars in the game that I either own, drive frequently, or have driven numerous times before, I've verified how they all sound. My 350Z sounded pitch perfect as you start it up upon selecting it. Same goes for my 370Z, it sounds spot on. Even a bunch of the standard cars sounded good, and sound even better with a few exhaust mods\\", while TweakTown said that \\"some cars just sounding flat when you feel they shouldn‚Äôt, and others just sending a shiver up your spine as you hit redline\\". Gamingreality awarded the sound 9/10, stating that \\"the sounds are clear, crisp, and distinct. The engine sounds are great and make you feel like the car is actually near you. The engine sounds on premium cars change when you make adjustments to it just like in real life\\". =Sales= In the UK, the chains Gamestation and Game between them opened around 100 stores at midnight on the day of release, so that customers could buy the game ahead of their normal 9am. EB Games and JB Hi-Fi in Australia did the same thing. The game was the multi-format number one for the week, despite only having been on sale for 2 days. In Japan, Gran Turismo 5 debuted in the software chart at number one, and this helped PS3 console sales more than double for the week ending November 28, 2010. As of March 2013, Gran Turismo 5 sold over 10 million units. For 13 days, 423,000 copies of the game were sold per day. Gran Turismo 5 was the best-selling video game for the PlayStation 3 until 2013 when it was beaten by Grand Theft Auto V. The Gran Turismo series as a whole has now totalled more than 65 million units sold so far worldwide and remains the highest-selling PlayStation-exclusive franchise of all time. According to Polyphony Digital, Gran Turismo 5 shifted 6.37 million units between its launch in November and the end of 2010. As of September 2012, Sony shipped 9.19 million units of Gran Turismo 5. Despite a late release in 2010, Gran Turismo 5 managed to become the 7th best selling PlayStation 3 title in the US, making the game the 2nd best selling exclusive of the year. Gran Turismo 5 also became the best selling PlayStation 3 exclusive in Europe, including the UK. Sales have exceeded 10 million units (of which, almost half were in Europe), this was announced during the 15th anniversary event at Silverstone, held on May 15, 2013. The game holds the record for the longest chart run for a racing game. =Awards= * Golden Joystick Awards 2011 - Best Racing Game (Won) Celebrity appearances Four- time NASCAR Cup champion Jeff Gordon appears in the game as a mentor to the player, guiding them in the skills of slipstreaming specific to the sport. Nine-time rally world champion S√©bastien Loeb and four-time F1 world champion Sebastian Vettel appear in similar roles in their portions of the game, providing advice and encouragement in a series of challenges. Other cars in the game are named after rally driver Tommi M√§kinen, drivers Carl Edwards and Kyle Busch, and personalities Shuichi Shigeno and Jay Leno. Voice overs were recorded by Justin Bell, Tony Jardine and Robert Reid. One of the game's testers, listed in the credits, was Tomei Sports/Porsche racing driver Takashi Ohi. On September 5, 2011, Martin Brundle and Jonathan Legard commentated on a race between David Coulthard, driving a real Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG around the Top Gear test track, and 6 leading Gran Turismo players, racing on a console at Mercedes-Benz World. Coulthard won, with Jason Birt trailing by half a second. Reggie Yates, Pollyanna Woodward and Mike Bushell also took part in the race, but did not qualify for the leader board. Coulthard's lap was subsequently available to download for players to race against. In partnership with Alpinestars, a downloadable pack released in October 2011 features replica helmets and overalls worn by drivers such as Tony Stewart, Jimmie Johnson, Petter Solberg, Mikko Hirvonen and The Stig. In January 2013, Johnny Herbert mentored 6 players in a primetime ITV4 reality series, with the aim of taking them to the Dubai 24 Hour race as real drivers. Other countries in Europe had heats mentored by drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and S√©bastien Buemi.

Published in 2007, the novel went received an Honourable Mention for Best Australian Horror Novel in the 12th Annual Aurealis Award (2007) and the Australian Shadows Award (2007). The last three stories received honorable mentions in the Year's Best Fantasy and Horror Volume 21. Plot introduction The Spiraling Worm consists of seven interconnected tales. Each story features spies and government agents battling terrorists and government conspiracies who wish to release cosmic horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos from their hidden dimensions to destroy the Earth. The seven stories are: *\\"Made of Meat\\" by David Conyers *\\"To What Green Altar\\" by John Sunseri *\\"Impossible Object\\" by David Conyers *\\"False Containment\\" by David Conyers *\\"Resurgence\\" by John Sunseri *\\"Weapon Grade\\" by David Conyers *\\"The Spiraling Worm\\" by David Conyers and John Sunseri Plot summary The book is introduced by C. J. Henderson with an After Word by the authors. The plot summaries of the seven stories are: *\\"Made of Meat\\": In the Cambodian jungles, Major Harrison Peel of the Australian Army Intelligence Corps and MI6 spy James Figgs, are involved in covert operations fighting a losing war against Tcho-Tcho terrorists. The Tcho-Tcho are able to predict Peel‚Äôs and Figgs‚Äô every move, efficiently eliminating the foreigner‚Äôs agents under their very noses. Peel seeks the aid of a Vietnam War veteran who provides him with the intelligence he requires to bring the Tcho-Tchos‚Äô reign to an end. *\\"To What Green Altar\\": In Siberia, Middle Eastern cultists slaughter every single employee at a remote Russian mine. In London, James Figgs calls NSA agent Jack Dixon to aid in the investigation of this attack, and together they uncover its connection to the 1908 Tunguska event. A trail leads to the Vatican City, where the summoning of a Cthulhu Mythos deity almost forces a global religious war between Muslims and Christians. *\\"Impossible Object\\": The ancient city of Pnakotus in Australia's Great Sandy Desert, a city that was once home to the Great Race of Yith, has been unearthed by the Australian government. Their secret investigation of its ruins found nothing of value except for a strange artifact, the Impossible Object, which no one can describe or classify. Harrison Peel, now head of security at the city, tries to understand its purpose before more scientific researchers die, or are erased from existence altogether by the Object‚Äôs unpredictable properties. *\\"False Containment\\": Harrison Peel travels from Australia to Thailand, to Los Angeles and then into the deserts of Nevada, spurred on by a strange encounter with himself from the future with disturbing news of a wormhole leading to a monstrous god called the Many-Thing that devours worlds. Toxic and nuclear waste is materializing all over the world, and Peel becomes convinced its source is a new waste treatment plant in Nevada, utilizing technology of great interest to the Pentagon, and derived from knowledge offered by the Impossible Object. *\\"Resurgence\\": Shoggoths from Antarctica are waking. Discovering that there is nothing to feed their hunger in the icy wastelands, and freed from their incarceration as slaves to the ancient alien race of the Elder Things, they advance northwards. In Argentina, Jack Dixon‚Äôs expertise is called upon to defeat a bold shoggoth, which he destroys with a nuclear weapon. Facing a similar foe in Australia, Harrison Peel is not able to deploy weapons of mass destruction because no one in the Australian or United States government will provide him with one, fearful of the political ramifications if a nuclear bomb is detonated on Australian soil. *\\"Weapon Grade\\": After suffering severe radiation poisoning from his encounter with a shoggoth in Sydney, Peel is dying. He hopes to go quietly, but Dixon calls upon Peel‚Äôs expertise, taking him to Utah, Antarctica and finally another universe, to secret US bases where Dixon‚Äôs government has long been studying the properties of shoggoths. Meanwhile, a rogue Israeli Mossad spy plans to steal a tissue sample of a shoggoth, only to be defeated by Peel as they pass between dimensions. The effects of higher-dimensional time flow, cures Peel of his radiation poisoning. *\\"The Spiraling Worm\\": In the jungle of the Eastern Congo Basin the cult of the Spiraling Worm is building an army, whose primary goal is to restore the powers of the Outer Gods. A team of British and American Special Forces, led by Peel, Dixon and Figgs, are sent into Africa to stop the army.

Although situated in Gloucestershire, the postal county for the village is Worcestershire, due to it being covered by the Broadway post town. It is an old village with much character. There are two pubs in the village - The Bell Inn and The New Inn. There is a primary school and as well as a large park area. The duck pond is much admired by visitors to the village. Pubs The Bell Inn is a 17th-century Cotswold stone Buildinghttp://www.the-bell- willersey.com/ its sign is a depiction of a large bell and the pub actual has a wooden bell tower to the right as you look at it. It is located about halfway down main street, next to Taylor's garage and opposite the duck pond. The New Inn is located toward the top of main street near the village shop.http://www.newinnbroadway.co.uk/  Transport  Between 1904 and 1960, Willersey was served by a halt on the Honeybourne Line. Today Willersey is served by three bus routes each operated by a different bus company. Willersey to Evesham, known as Rural 4 is operated by N.N. Cresswell Coach Hire Ltd. Prior to Autumn 2013 the Willersey to Evesham was operated by Castleways Coaches. The Willersey to Cheltenham route is operated by Castleways Coaches.http://www.castleways.co.uk/timetables.html The third route is Moreton-in-Marsh to Stratford-upon-Avon which is operated by Johnsons buses.http://www.johnsonscoaches.co.uk/PDFs/21___22_Bus_Timetable_NEW.pdf The nearest railway station to Willersey is Honeybourne which is served by the Cotswold line, offering a direct journey to London Paddington. However Honeybourne station is unreachable by public transport so travellers can go by bus to Moreton-in-Marsh or Evesham to catch a train on the same line. Taylor's garage in Willersey sells fuel and offers motor repairs. Mr Taylor, the garage owner, has a collection of classic cars which are on show at various times of the year in the garage and also during special events within the village. The next event is the Willersey Horticultural and Craft Show on 26 August, Bank Holiday Monday. Industry Unlike many Cotswold villages, Willersey is not a tourist magnet. Despite its beauty and typical village charm Willersey remains unspoilt by rows of tourist shops. Instead Willersey is an industrial and farming village. The village has its own industrial estate with many businesses and is home to Auto-Sleepers a motorhome manufacturer and Vale Press a printing company.

He is known for his provocative works and is often referred to as his country's enfant terrible. Biography =Early life= Alfian bin Sa'at is a Muslim Singaporean of Minangkabau, Javanese and Chinese Hakka descent.Alfian Bin Sa‚Äôat An alumnus of Tampines Primary School, Raffles Institution, and Raffles Junior College, Alfian was the chairman of the drama societies, both known as Raffles Players, in both RI and RJC. He also took part in the Creative Arts Programme twice ‚Äì once at fifteen, and a second time at seventeen ‚Äì both times under the mentorship of Haresh Sharma. He has since returned to the programme as an occasional mentor. During his two years at RJC, Alfian received the Kripalani Award for Outstanding Contribution to Creative Arts. Alfian attended medical classes at the National University of Singapore but did not graduate. =Career= In 1998, Alfian published his first collection of poetry, One Fierce Hour at the age of twenty-one. The book was acclaimed as \\"truly a landmark for poetry [in Singapore]\\" by The Straits Times, and Alfian himself was described by Malaysia's New Straits Times as \\"one of the most acclaimed poets in his country... a prankish provocateur, libertarian hipster\\". A year later, Alfian published his first collection of short stories, Corridor, which won the Singapore Literature Prize Commendation Award. Seven of the short stories from the collection have since been adapted for television. In 2001, he published his second collection of poetry, A History of Amnesia, which was hailed by The Straits Times as \\"one of the most powerful collections by a Singaporean\\" in addition to being shortlisted for a Kiriyama Asia-Pacific Book Prize. Alfian won both the inaugural National Arts Council-Singapore Press Holdings Golden Point Award for Poetry in the same year, as well as the National Arts Council's Young Artist Award for Literature. Alfian's plays, written in both English and Malay, have received broad attention in both Singapore and Malaysia. They have also been translated into German and Swedish, and have been read and performed in London, Zurich, Stockholm, Berlin, Hamburg and Munich. His first play was produced when he was 19, and he has had a long association as a playwright with theatre group The Necessary Stage as well as with Teater Ekamatra, a Malay theatre group known for articulating minority concerns in Chinese-majority Singapore. Alfian is currently the resident playwright of theatre group W!LD RICE. In 2015, Nadirah was selected by The Business Times as one of the \\"finest plays in 50 years\\" alongside productions by Goh Poh Seng, Michael Chiang and Haresh Sharma and others. In 2016, it was reported that sex.violence.blood.gore, a play he co- wrote, and his short story collection Malay Sketches is on the reading list of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, while the University of York has his poem \\"Singapore You Are Not My Country\\" and West Virginia University his selected poems on their reading lists. In particular, the University of York's Dr Claire Chambers noted that this was because Alfian \\"introduces non-Anglophone words and concepts, and puts together words in an expressive portmanteau style\\".

Kashf describes the state of experiencing a personal divine revelation after ascending through spiritual struggles, and uncovering the heart (a spiritual faculty) in order to allow divine truths to pour into it. Kashf is etymologically related to mukashafa ‚Äúdisclosure‚Äù/ ‚Äúdivine irradiation of the essence‚Äù, which connotes ‚Äúgain[ing] familiarity with things unseen behind the veils‚Äù. For those who have purified their hearts, and who come to know the Divine Names and Attributes to the fullest of their individual capacities, the veils in front of the purely spiritual realms are opened slightly, and they begin to gain familiarity with the unseen. In Sufism, an even further revelatory capacity exists by which the Divine mysteries become readily apparent to the seeker through the light of knowledge of God. This is called tajalli \\"manifestation\\".  Veil References in Islamic Literature  Two passages in the Qur'an serve as the most solid basis for elaboration on the Sufi concept of kashf: :* [50.22] ‚ÄòThou wast heedless of this; therefore We have now removed from thee thy covering [veil], and so thy sight today is piercing.‚Äô :* [53.57-58] The Immanent is immanent; apart from God none can disclose [remove] it. The verb ‚Äúkashafa,‚Äù but never the noun ‚Äúkashf‚Äù occurs in the Qur'an a variety of times in the sense of either ‚Äúto uncover‚Äù (a part of the body) or ‚Äúto take away‚Äù (misfortune, danger). Hadith of the Veils One hadith holds particular significance for the concept of kashf: 2 - \\"Between God (mighty and sublime) and creation are 70,000 veils. The nearest of creatures to God (mighty and sublime) are Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, and between them and Him are four veils: a veil of fire, a veil of darkness, a veil of cloud, and a veil of water.\\" This Hadith is quoted somewhat differently by Ibn Majah as follows: ‚ÄúGod has seventy thousand veils of light and darkness; if He were to remove them, the radiant splendors of His Face would burn up whoever (or ‚Äòwhatever creature‚Äô) was reached by His Gaze.‚Äù It is said that Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin to the Prophet Muhammad, prayed a prayer that included this excerpt during the month of Sha'baan: My Lord, grant me complete severance of my relations with everything else and total submission to You. Enlighten the eyes of our hearts with the light of their looking at You to the extent that they penetrate the veils of light and reach the Source of Grandeur, and let our souls get suspended by the glory of Your sanctity.  Sufi Scholars on Kashf  Al-Kushayri expands on al-Kalabadhi‚Äôs proposal that tajalli (manifestation) of ‚Äúthe essence‚Äù of the Divine is called mukashafa. He then illustrates three stages in progression towards understanding the Real: :# Muhadara‚Äîgetting oneself into position vis-√†-vis the objective sought. The objective remains veiled at this stage. This stage presupposes the presence of the heart, but relies on transmission of proof through the intellect (i.e. understanding God through his miraculous signs). :# Mukashafa‚Äîlifting of the veil. Here reasoning (of the intellect) gives way to evident proof (through intuition). One directly encounters the Attributes of God. Yet, this stage is still considered an intermediary stage. :# Mushahada‚Äîdirect vision. This stage indicates an immediate encounter with The Real, without the intellect OR the intuition acting as an intermediary. This is direct experience of the Divine Essence. Al-Ghazali‚ÄîThis Sufi scholar discusses the concept of kashf, not purely in its mystical sense, but also with respect to theology in general. In conjunction with Al-Kushayri, Al- Ghazali links kashf with intuition. For Al-Ghazali, mukashafa has a dual sense: :# It indicates an inner state of purification, which is subjective and brought about by ‚Äúunveiling‚Äù or kashf. :# It describes the objective truths that are revealed through the ‚Äúunveiling‚Äù/kashf. Since, for Al-Ghazali, kashf is linked to intuition, he describes mukashafa as the certain knowledge of the unseen discovered by the ‚Äúscience of the saints‚Äù. Thus, kashf is considered ‚Äúa light,‚Äù that is freely bestowed upon the purified worshipper through the grace of God, yet also yields sure intuitive knowledge for the worshipper upon whom it is bestowed. Ibn Arabi‚ÄîThis Sufi mystic indicates the necessity for ‚Äúdivine unveiling‚Äù (kashf) as the means by which to understand the universality of the reality of realities (i.e. the universality of God‚Äôs oneness). In fana (self- annihilation), the individual ego passes away and divine self-manifestation occurs. This self-manifestation is eternal (as it comes from God), but it must be continually reenacted by the human in time. Therefore, the human becomes a pure receptor required for pure consciousness to be realized. The human is a sort of barzakh or intermediary between divinity and elementality, between spirit and matter, and open to the experience of kashf. Ali Hujwiri‚ÄîThe author of the Persian Sufi text Kashf ul Mahjoob (Revelation of the Veiled) Hujwiri argues, along with Al-Kushayri that very few real Sufis exist anymore in his time; rather, there are a large number of ‚Äúfalse pretenders‚Äù which he calls mustaswif‚Äî‚Äúthe would-be Sufi‚Äù. In his text, Hujwiri describes the ‚Äúveils which should be lifted‚Äù in order to purify one's heart and really pursue Sufism. Hujwiri argues for the importance of ‚Äúmorals‚Äù over ‚Äúformal practice‚Äù in Sufism. He was the first to directly address the problematic diversity in Muslim belief during his time. In Kashf ul Mahjoob, he describes various Sufi approaches to theoretical ideas, linking them to particular key Sufi figures.  Kashf and Shi‚Äôism  In Shi‚Äôism, the spiritual experience of kashf is treated as a theological rather than purely mystical dimension. :Imamis‚ÄîSayyid Haydar Amuli distinguishes three kinds of knowledge: 1) by the intellect, 2) by transmission, 3) by kashf‚Äîthis is the only form of knowledge that leads to true understanding of Reality :Amuli additionally distinguishes between two kinds of kashf: :#kashf suwari‚Äîdivine manifestations reach the senses of sight and hearing :# 'kashf ma‚Äônawi‚Äîspiritual encounter, such as the disclosure indicated by mukashafa'' :Ismalis‚Äîthese followers of Shi‚Äôism put emphasis on kashf in a double sense as both a Gnostic and cosmic ‚Äústate.‚Äù The Ismalis define ‚Äúcycles of metahistory‚Äù which alternate between phases of ‚Äúunveiling‚Äù (dawr-al-kashf) and ‚Äúoccultation‚Äù (dawr-al-satr).  Controversy in the Muslim World  The concept of kashf remains controversial in the Muslim world because it indicates the ability to ‚Äúknow‚Äù the unknowable. According to the Qur'an, Muslims are required to believe in the unseen (namely Allah), but knowledge of the unseen is a power that should belong solely to God. But it does not contradict the quran because only God has knowledge of the unseen and if someone else other than God has that knowledge, then it's only because it was given to them by God. Sufis further would argue that ‚Äúthe only guide to God is God Himself‚Äù. They do believe that every genuine worshipper has the capability to experience unveiling (personal revelation), but that this personal revelation occurs by the grace of God. Some say, if a worshipper fails to experience unveiling, \\"it indicates that that person is pursuing Sufism for a reason other than the love of God alone.\\" - However this in fact, incorrect. As devout Sufis believe that every individual's experience in sufism is different, similaraly to how different people have the ability to see different things, therefore one can confirm that Kashf is not an ability granted to everyone. God is in fact the one who does the unveiling once a person has given up on all worldly forms of knowledge and his/her heart is pure and open for God. It is God's will to choose what people see and which people see. Ibn ‚ÄòArabi calls this ‚Äúinner receptivity‚Äù to the manifestation (tajalli) of the Divine Mysteries, the essence of which is mukashafa.  Peripatetic Scholars vs. Sufis  Peripatetic scholars such as Avicenna, al- Kindi, and al-Farabi argue that the intellect unaided by divine unveiling (kashf) is sufficient in order for man to attain ultimate truth. Sufis such as Bayazid Bastami, Rumi, and Ibn al-Arabi, contrarily argue that the limited human intellect is insufficient and misleading as a means of understanding ultimate truth. This kind of understanding requires intimate, personal, direct knowledge resulting from the removal of the veils separating man from God as given to man by God himself. This is kashf.  Other Types of Kashf  The 18th century mystic Khwaja Mir Dard (d. 1785) (, relying upon the traditional terminology, classified the revelations as follows in his \`Ilm al-Kitab: *Kashf kaunƒ´, revelation on the plane of the created things, is a result of pious actions and purifications of the lower soul; it becomes manifest in dreams and clairvoyance. *Kashf ilƒÅhƒ´, divine revelation, is a fruit of constant worship and polishing of the heart; it results in the knowledge of the world of spirits and in cardiognosis [\\"soul-reading\\"] so that the mystic sees hidden things and reads hidden thoughts. *Kashf aqlƒ´, revelation by reason, is essentially the lowest grade of intuitive knowledge; it can be attained by polishing the moral faculties, and can be experienced by the philosophers as well. *Kashf ƒ´mƒÅnƒ´, revelation through faith, is the fruit of perfect faith after man has acquired proximity to the perfections of prophethood. He will be blessed by direct divine addresses ‚Äî he talks with the angels, meets the spirits of the prophets, and sees the Night of Might and the blessings of the month of Rama·∏çan in human form in the ƒÅlam almithƒÅl.Annemarie Schimmel, Mystical dimensions of Islam (1975), pg192 References Category:Sufism ","title":"Kashf"},{"id":"12231898","text":"Pakkam Kottur is a small village in Tamil Nadu, a southern state of India.

This may be to protect plants in horticulture, preserve grassland for grazing animals, separate species carrying diseases (vector species) from livestock, prevent troublesome species entering roadways, or to protect endemic species in nature reserves. These fences are not necessarily traditional wire barriers, but may also include barriers of sound, or smell. Design techniques Animals can be excluded by a fence's height, depth under the ground and mesh size. It is also important to choose a construction material that cannot be climbed; furthermore, sometimes it is necessary to create a subsurface fencing element to prevent burrowing under the fence.Predator exclusion fence considerations Fences are usually designed with the target pest species (the species to be excluded) in mind, and the fences are made to effectively exclude those species. This results in a wide variety of designs for pest exclusion fences (see examples below). =Examples= *The 1.9m-high fence at the Orokonui Ecosanctuary in Waitati, New Zealand is designed to keep out all introduced mammals such as possums, rats, stoats, ferrets and even mice. It uses stainless steel mesh that continues down to form a skirt at ground level that prevents animals from burrowing under it. On the top is a curved steel hood that prevents climbers like cats and possums from climbing over the top. First Major Milestone Achieved for the Orokonui Ecosanctuary on orokonui.org.nz *Agricultural exclusion fences in central-western Queensland vary between 1.6m and 2m in height. The fences have a single top barbed wire and ring-lock or hinge-joint wire underneath and steel fence posts. The ring-lock or hinge joint wire has smaller holes at the bottom, gradually increasing in size to be marginally larger at the top. A section of this mesh lays flat against the ground at the bottom of the posts to form a skirt (or radial-apron) on the outside of the fence. *In Africa and Asia, crop-raiding elephants are excluded using a variety of techniques. These include electric fencing, fences of cacti, chilli-greased rope, and bee-hives or sounds of disturbed bees.  Use in Australia  = Barrier fencing = Australia has utilised exclusion fencing since the 1860s. The most well known exclusion fences in Australia are the barrier fences. Barrier fences are long (usually linear) barriers erected for the purpose of excluding particular species from large portions of Australia. The most well known barrier fences are the Dingo Fence and the Rabbit-proof fence, but there are many others. = Agricultural exclusion fencing = In more recent years, pest-exclusion fences have been built around singular properties, or groups of properties. This practice is known as cluster fencing. Cluster fencing allows farmers to monitor and mitigate predation pressure on livestock, and monitor Total Grazing Pressure (TGP) through accurate abundance data of native, pest, and domestic herbivores. = Conservation fencing = Australia uses pest-exclusion fencing to separate several high-value or threatened species from introduced predators. One such example is Arid Recovery in South Australia, where feral cat, red fox and rabbit have been removed for the conservation of 5 threatened species. Use in New Zealand Prior to human settlement New Zealand had no land-based mammals apart from three bat species. The introduced mammal species, such as rabbits, deer, and possum, have since caused huge ecological changes to the biota of New Zealand. Pest-exclusion fences are increasingly used for conservation of indigenous species by excluding all mammals. Locations of predator-proof fences include: *Cape Brett *Cape Farewell *Deans Bush, Christchurch *Zealandia, Wellington *Bushy Park *Maungatautari Restoration Project *Orokonui Ecosanctuary *Shakespear Regional Park *Styx Mill Reserve, Christchurch (under construction) *Stewart Island *Tawharanui Peninsula See also *Deer fence * Rabbit-proof fence * Dingo fence * Ecological island * Exclosure References Category:Fences Category:Animal migration Category:Land management ","title":"Pest-exclusion fence"},{"id":"12231972","text":"Gorzyce may refer to the following places in Poland: *Gorzyce, Ko≈õcian County in Greater Poland Voivodeship (west-central Poland) *Gorzyce, Wrze≈õnia County in Greater Poland Voivodeship (west-central Poland) *Gorzyce, Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship (north-central Poland) *Gorzyce, Lesser Poland Voivodeship (south Poland) *Gorzyce, Silesian Voivodeship (south Poland) *Gorzyce, Przeworsk County in Subcarpathian Voivodeship (south-east Poland) *Gorzyce, Tarnobrzeg County in Subcarpathian Voivodeship (south-east Poland) *Gorzyce, Jas≈Ço County in Subcarpathian Voivodeship (south-east Poland) *G√≥rzyce, Lower Silesian Voivodeship (south-west Poland) ","title":"Gorzyce"},{"id":"12231980","text":"Vasa Loch is a brackish lagoon in southwestern Shapinsay, Orkney Islands.

Furthermore, they believed that music could be made cheaply and with home software and hardware to enable anyone to get their ideas, music and media out to the public outside of the mainstream sources. The website www.mnemonicgroove.com went through a number of incarnations to allow online sales and showcasing of the band's work. However, the only means available to the band for online payment in the late 90s with a low administration costs was via postal cheques which hampered the concept altogether. Sales were for physical media were sent via post as broadband had not yet implemented in most countries hampering digital downloading. Music playing software for computers was generally not readily available to the public and limited to professional applications. Furthermore, online legalities for online purchase and payments were not clear and the band did not have the resources to pursue this thoroughly through legal and logistical avenues. With regards to online music releases, as founding guitarist Jonathan Skipp mentions in an interview after the release of \\"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\\" beating U2's CD Single release date; \\"To those who believe that music is a product that can be packaged and sold in... little plastic wrappers like salted \\"durians\\", ...... \\"Your old road is rapidly agin'.

His intimidating commands lead to partial paralysis of Hemlata's lower limbs and also a simmering discontent amongst other descendants. After numerous attempts fail to cure Hemalata, the king hires a new doctor, Sanjay (Sunil Dutt), who contrary to expectations, is not just young and handsome, but also against silly protocols that hamper laughter, fun and frolic. Dr. Sanjay's experimentations provide greater mobility and joy to the youngsters, giving them a fresh lease of life and a much needed voice of rebellion. Transcending normal barriers of doctor-client confidentiality, Sanjay and Hemalata fall in love and the romance enables her to walk in double quick time on her feet! Initially reluctant, the king awakens to a new dawn of freedom and humbly accepts not just their relationship, but also Ashalata's betrothal to social activist (Soodesh Kumar), who defeats him in a general election.

It is very closely related to Cantius and may even be its subgenus. It may also have given rise to the Middle Eocene Uintan primate Hesperolemur, although this is controversial. From mass estimates based on the first molar, the two species, P. jarrovii and P. danielsae, weighed 4.5 kg and 6.3 kg respectively and were frugivores with an arboreal, quadrupedal locomotion. History Pelycodus was first identified as Prototomus jarrovii by Cope in 1874, who pronounced it a rare inhabitant of both Wyoming and New Mexico. Over the next hundred years, approximately a dozen species were added, most more primitive dentally than the now renamed Pelycodus jarrovii.Fleagle, J. G. 1999. Primate Adaptation and Evolution. San Diego, Academic Press. In 1977, all but two species were moved into Cantius by Philip D. Gingerich on the basis of differences in their molars.Gebo, DL. 2002. Adapiformes: phylogeny and adaptation. The Primate Fossil Record. Cambridge University Press There is some disagreement as to whether Pelycodus is distinct enough to be a separate genus.Mikko's Phylogeny Archive Morphology Pelycodus is placed within adapiforms because of its annular ectotympanic, small eyes, non- elongated tarsus and numerous premolar and molar crests and within Notharctinae because of its four premolars, unfused mandible, a hypocone derived from the postprotocingulum and a lacrimal bone within the orbit. There is, however, a great deal of individual variation in the dentition of Pelycodus, which has made it hard to differentiate between Pelycodus and Cantius species. Distinguishing features of the Cantius/Pelycodus clade are the comparatively smaller hypocones and mesostyles. The distinguishing features of Pelycodus from Cantius are its anteroposteriorly compressed trigonid, its small paraconid on M2 and lack of hypoconulid on M1-2. It has a much better developed hypocone and mesostyle than many species of Cantius, but not quite as developed as Notharctus.Gingerich, PD and Simons, EL. Systematics, Phylogeny and Evolution of Early Eocene Adapidae in North America. 1977. The shape of the molars indicates that Pelycodus, like Cantius and unlike later folivorous Notharctines such as Notharctus and Smilodectes, was most likely a frugivore, though perhaps not as strictly as Cantius. However, there is almost no difference between the tarsal bones of the earliest Cantius and latest Pelycodus, indicating that their arboreal, quadrupedal locomotion was probably primitive. Only with later Notharctines was there a shift toward more lemur-like locomotion with longer hindlimbs, trunks and tails, perhaps related to the shift in diet.Martin, Robert D. 1993. Primate Origins: plugging the gaps. Nature, 363:223-234. Phylogeny It is very well demonstrated that chronologically successive lineages of Cantius grew progressively larger mesostyles and hypocones, eventually gaining enough distinction dentally to be placed in the genus Pelycodus. This is one of the best stratophenetic sequences in the Eocene, and is supporting evidence for gradualism in evolution. However, even though this well documented fossil sequence appears linear, it probably is an underestimation of the diversity of these genera. It is not certain which, if any, lineages Pelycodus gave rise to. Some authors have suggested that it is closely related to Notharctus, while others have argued that its size already exceeded that of primitive Notharctus and therefore was not the most parsimonious phylogeny.Godinot, M. A Summary of Adapiform Systematics and Phylogeny. Folia Primatologica, 1998 These scientists either link Pelycodus with the poorly known Hesperolemur or place it as a terminating branch.

Date and performance The play's date is uncertain; it is usually assigned to the 1619‚Äì23 period by scholars. It was acted by the King's Men; the cast list added to the play in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679 cites Joseph Taylor, Nicholas Tooley, John Lowin, William Ecclestone, John Underwood, Richard Sharpe, Robert Benfield, and Thomas Holcombe ‚Äì the same cast list as for The Little French Lawyer and The Custom of the Country, two other Fletcherian plays of the same era. The inclusion of Taylor dates the play after the March 1619 death of Richard Burbage. Authorship As he often did, Fletcher depended on a Spanish source for the plot of his play; in this case, Grisel y Mirabella (c. 1495) by Juan de Flores supplied part of the main plot. He also appears to have been influenced by Geoffrey Chaucer's The Wife of Bath's Tale from The Canterbury Tales for the riddle which Silvio is set to solve by the Duchess within a year's time as well as Belvidere's disguise as an old hag and demand to marry him as boon for providing him with the answer to the riddle.Helen Cooper, \\"Jacobean Chaucer\\", Refiguring Chaucer in the Renaissance ed. Theresa M. Krier, Gainesville, Florida, University Press of Florida, 1998; pp. 191-2. Fletcher drew material for the subplot from three tales in the Decameron of Boccaccio, another dependable resource.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 50. Scholars attribute the play to Fletcher alone, since his characteristic pattern of stylistic and textual preferences is continuous throughout the text; but some critics favor the view that the extant text is a revision by Fletcher of an earlier play of his own authorship.Logan and Smith, pp. 50 and 73. See his Monsieur Thomas for a comparable case of Fletcher revising himself. He also borrowed from himself: Women Pleased shares a plot point (the heroine dressing up as an old woman to influence the plot) that also occurs in The Pilgrim, in a way that suggests Women Pleased is the earlier work.Maxwell, Baldwin. Studies in Beaumont, Fletcher, and Massinger. Chapel Hill, NC, University of North Carolina Press, 1939; p. 218. In subject matter and source material, Fletcher's play parallels the anonymous drama Swetnam the Woman-Hater, which was first printed in 1620. It is unclear which play had priority over the other.Logan and Smith, pp. 210‚Äì12. After 1660 Like many of Fletcher's plays,Women Pleased was revived during the Restoration era; Samuel Pepys saw it on 26 December 1668. David Garrick would borrow from Fletcher's play for his pantomime A Christmas Tale, staged at Drury Lane in 1773.Elizabeth P. Stein, David Garrick, Dramatist. New York, Modern Language Association of America, 1937; p. 144. Synopsis Set in Florence, the play focuses its main plot on the love match between its protagonists, Silvio and Belvidere. Belvidere is the daughter and only child of the reigning Duchess, and so a highly desirable marital partner; when the Duke of Milan, one of her suitors, goes so far as to try to kidnap her, the Duchess's guards drive his party off by force. Belvidere is then lodged in the duchy's fortress, where she can be protected; but she is now isolated from Silvio and other would-be suitors. Silvio exploits a family connection ‚Äì the wife of the citadel's keeper is his aunt ‚Äì to meet his beloved; but he is caught and brought before the angry Duchess. (As a mere private gentleman, Silvio is not considered a fit partner for the duchy's heir.) Silvio faces a penalty of death; but the two lovers compete to claim responsibility before the council that tries Silvio, leaving the judges confused. The Duchess decides to be merciful, and banishes Silvio for a year; she furthermore gives Silvio a chance at marrying Belvidere ‚Äì if he can solve the riddle she poses him. With Silvio gone, Belvidere pretends to be cured of her infatuation with him; she seems to acquiesce to her mother's plan to marry her to the Duke of Siena. (In the process, Belvidere discovers the riddle and its answer from her mother.) Before the arranged marriage can take place, however, Belvidere vanishes from the court. The Duke of Siena, feeling he's been played for a fool, withdraws in anger and prepares a military response. Silvio wanders about the country in disguise; he consults \\"Diviners, dreamers, schoolmen, deep magicians\\" in search of an answer to the Duchess's riddle, but without much success. In the countryside, he falls in with a set of farm people and morris dancers; he also meets an old woman who claims special insight, and who he considers a Sibyl. The old woman, in fact, is Belvidere in disguise. She advises Silvio to join the fight against the invading Duke of Siena; he does so, and becomes the great hero of the Florentine victory when he captures the Duke. The old Sibyl (Belvidere in disguise) advises Silvio to turn himself in to the Duchess's authorities; she assures him that she will preserve him and unite him with Belvidere, and in gratitude he promises to grant whatever \\"boon\\" she shall ask of him. Silvio arrives at court, and proves he is the man who secured the victory with the bejeweled cameo portrait of Belvidere that he took from the Duke of Siena. When he reveals his identity, however, the Duchess is ready to have him executed. Silvio reminds the Duchess of their riddle bargain; and she, confident of her position, allows him to venture a solution ‚Äì which Belvidere has provided him. The play's riddle is a version of one that recurs through traditional literature and folklore; in its simplest form, the riddle's question is \\"What does a woman want?\\" The play states its version of the riddle in verse, and adds an ironic and contradictory twist to it: ::Tell me what is that only thing :::For which all women long; ::Yet having what they most desire, :::To have it does them wrong. The answer to the traditional riddle is that \\"A woman wants to have her will\\" ‚Äì in modern terms, to have her own way. The play is faithful to its folklore source: ::::::...in good or ill, :::They desire to have their will; ::Yet when they have it, they abuse it, :::For they know not how to use it. In producing the correct answer, Silvio has won...but no one knows the whereabouts of Belvidere. The old Sibyl throws another twist into the plot: she demands, as her \\"boon,\\" that Silvio marry her. The Duchess and the Duke of Siena are delighted at this twist, feeling that Silvio is being taught his lesson; SIlvio, though tortured by his apparent fate, proves to be a man of honor and agrees to the marriage...which turns out perfectly well once Belvidere reveals her true identity. The Duchess consoles the disappointed Duke of Siena by marrying him herself; in the end, both mother and daughter are \\"women pleased.\\" (The scenes in the country provide an element of satire against the Puritans who were hostile to stage plays and to traditional celebrations of many types, including Morris dancing. The dancer who was set to dance the hobby horse is a convert to Puritanism who refuses the role on religious grounds; there is a good deal of ridiculous back-and-forth, attacking and defending \\"This beast of Babylon...The hopeful hobby horse.\\") The play's subplot involves that staple of comedy, a rich old miser married to a beautiful young wife. Lopez, a \\"sordid userer,\\" is jealous of his wife Isabella, who is pursued by two would-be seducer/adulterers; one is the elderly Bartello, the commander of the city's fortress (who supplies a connection between main plot and subplot); the second and more serious seducer is a handsome young gallant who calls himself \\"Rugio.\\" Rugio has a servant named Soto who provides much of the play's comic material. (Soto is a stock thin-man or \\"lean fool\\" figure, common in the dramas of the King's Men; see the entry on John Shank for details.) The subplot features the elements typical of its kind of humor, with characters hiding behind tapestries and even up chimneys to avoid discovery. In the end, Isabella seems tempted by Rugio but stands firm as a chaste wife; and Rugio reveals himself to be Isabella's brother Claudio in disguise. The subplot constitutes one of the \\"chastity tests\\" that are such a regular and striking feature in Fletcher's plays.Nancy Cotton Pearse, John Fletcher's Chastity Plays: Mirrors of Modesty, Lewisburg, PA, Bucknell University Press, 1973. Evaluations \\"Women Pleased is an excellent example of Fletcher's composite art, whereby tragicomedy and a variety of the comedy of manners, trespassing on absolute farce, are not unhappily wedded together into an entertainment which could not but have been very effective in the hands of a skillful troupe.\\"Felix Emanuel Schelling, Elizabethan Drama, 1558‚Äì1642. 2 Volumes, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1908; Vol. 2, pp. 209‚Äì10.

Background  Gao Jifu was born in 596. He was from the locale that would eventually be the Tang Empire's De Prefecture (Âæ∑Â∑û, roughly modern Dezhou, Shandong). His grandfather, Gao Biao (È´òË°®), was a commandery governor during either the late Northern Wei dynasty or Northern Wei's branch successor state, Eastern Wei. His father, Gao Heng (È´òË°°), was a county magistrate during the Sui dynasty. Gao Jifu himself was said to be both studious and trained in martial arts when he was young, and was also said to be particularly appropriate in his actions during the mourning period after his mother's death. His elder brother, Gao Yuandao (È´òÂÖÉÈÅì), served as the magistrate of Ji County (Ê±≤Á∏£, in modern Xinxiang, Henan). In 618 or 619, when the Sui Empire was on the verge of total collapse after the death of Emperor Yang, the people of Ji County surrendered to agrarian rebels, and Gao Yuandao was killed in the process. Gao Jifu led his brother's followers in combat and was able to capture and execute thoseGao Jifu's biography in the Old Book of Tang does not specify whether the killer(s) of Gao Yuandao that Gao Jifu killed was singular or plural. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 78 who killed his brother, taking their heads to his brother's tomb to be offered to his brother. Thereafter, he gathered his own band of agrarian rebels. He soon submitted to the rule of the Tang dynasty, one of the regimes that rose out of the confusion of the Sui Empire's collapse, along with another rebel leader in the region, Li Yude (ÊùéËÇ≤Âæ∑),Gao Jifu's biography in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang gave the name as Li Houde (ÊùéÂéöÂæ∑), but the Zizhi Tongjian gave it as Li Yude, and the name Li Yude is generally used in tertiary sources. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 78, and New Book of Tang, vol. 104, with Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 186. who had been a general of the rebel ruler Li Mi, and was made the military advisor to Li Yude, who was made the prefect of Zhi Prefecture (ÈôüÂ∑û, roughly modern Jiaozuo, Henan).  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Gao Jifu's activities for the next several years are not recorded in history. It was said that early in the reign of the second Tang emperor, Emperor Taizong, Gao was serving as assistant imperial censor, and he often pointed out faults of the other officials, as his duty as assistant censors, without fearing reprisals. He was eventually made a midlevel official at the legislative bureau of the government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). In 634, he was serving as such when, in response to Emperor Taizong's call for officials to offer suggestions, Gao offered five suggestions, in these areas: * He suggested that greater emphasis should be paid to promoting officials who were kind and honest. * He suggested that the conscription of people into public works projects should be reduced. * He suggested that ways should be found to curb the tendency for princesses and nobles to conduct business to make more money, as he opined that their stipends were already sufficient. * He suggested that local officials' salaries should be increased, as he opined that at the time the salaries were not sufficient for them to support their families. * He suggested that clear guidelines should be established that the emperor's sons be considered lower in rank than the emperor's brothers, as it was not clear at the time, leading to confusion in how the emperor's sons and brothers dealt with each other. Emperor Taizong praised him for his suggestions. In 643, Gao was made an assistant head of household to the crown prince, Li Zhi. In response to further suggestions about governance that Gao suggested, Emperor Taizong awarded him with a stalactite, then used as medication, stating, \\"You provided medication for the state, so I am providing you with medication.\\" In 644, he was made the assistant minister of civil service affairs, and was said to be appropriate in his selection of officials. Emperor Taizong awarded him with a gold-plated mirror to symbolize that his acts were clean and honorable. In 645, during Emperor Taizong's campaign against Goguryeo, Emperor Taizong left Li Zhi at Ding Prefecture (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei), to be in charge of logistics, assisted by a number of officials led by the chancellor Gao Shilian, and Gao Jifu was a member of Li Zhi's staff there.The New Book of Tang indicated that Gao Jifu was made a de facto chancellor at this point. See New Book of Tang, vol. 61. However, this, if true, appeared to be no longer the case after the end of the Goguryeo campaign, and could have been simply a temporary measure during the Goguryeo campaign, as he was not referred to as chancellor again until 648 when he was made the head of the legislative bureau. In 648, he was made Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§)‚Äîthe head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor, and also served as minister of civil service affairs. He also participated in the editing of imperial history, and was enfeoffed as the Duke of Tiao‚Äîhis home county.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  After Emperor Taizong died in 649, Li Zhi succeeded him (as Emperor Gaozong). In 651, Gao Jifu was made Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠), the head of the examination bureau of government, still a post considered for a chancellor. In 652, he also took on the additional title of advisor for Emperor Gaozong's crown prince, Li Zhong. Later, he was soon said to be forced to reduced to home rest due to an illness, and Emperor Gaozong recalled his brother, Gao Jitong (È´òÂ≠£ÈÄö), who was then the prefect of Guo Prefecture (Ëô¢Â∑û, part of modern Sanmenxia, Henan), to be the assistant minister of imperial clan affairs, so that he could attend to Gao Jifu. Gao Jifu died in 654.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 78. * New Book of Tang, vol. 104. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 194, 197, 199.

Awards In 2003, Shibli won the 9th Nathan Gottesdiener Israeli Art Prize.Recognizing the Unrecognized: The Photographs of Ahlam Shibli Works =Solo Exhibitions = Ahlam Shibli's photo works are a complex testimony to the presence and absence of a home. Using documentary procedures, Shibli has developed a body of work eschewing the objectivity associated with photojournalism. Rather than visual evidence, her photographic practice involves a conversational engagement with the subjects. Each series encapsulates the knowledge obtained through an empirical contact with colonialism and conflict while eluding climax and drama often deployed by media representations.Ahlam Shibli. Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona. 14 November 2012. Series such as Goter (2002‚Äì03), Arab al-Sbaih (2007) and The Valley (2007‚Äì08) are informed by a topographic character. Shibli's views of landscapes, towns, precarious settlements, interiors, and exteriors, as well as cemeteries, exhibit an accumulation of signs that reveal the effects of the Israeli rule over the land. An outstanding example of this complex narrative is Trackers (2005), a series of photographs concerned with young Arab men who decide to enroll in the Israeli army. In the artist's own words, the project investigates the price paid by a colonized minority to a majority of colonizers, so they can be accepted, change their identity, survive, or perhaps all of this and more. More recent works such as Trauma (2008‚Äì09) have confronted the ambiguous nature of colonialism and occupation and the relentless search for the meanings of home. Starting with commemorations of the atrocious massacre at Tulle that took place on 9 July 1944, Shibli reflects on the paradox of a population that resisted the German occupation, only to embark a few years later on a colonial war in Indochina and Algeria. Series such as this, or the one dedicated to the daily life in Polish orphanages, Dom Dziecka. The house starves when you are away (2008), or Eastern LGBT (2006), in which Shibli documents the lives of transsexual communities, extend her modus operandi beyond the Palestinian issue. In the series Death (2011‚Äì12), a pivotal work in this exhibition, Shibli explores some of the ways in which the absent ones are present again ‚Äì 're-presented': Palestinian fighters who fell in the course of their armed resistance against an Israeli incursion, victims of the Israeli military killed under different circumstances (Shahid), men and women who exploded themselves to assassin Israelis (Istishhadi), or the prisoners who in very global terms might be considered failed martyrs. The numerous representations of martyrs are the visual motif that allows Shibli to reveal how the Palestinian community structures the public and domestic sphere around these absent figures and their death. Often reduced to iconic reproductions that flatten bodies and faces in the name of national identity politics, the compulsive proliferation of memorials bears testimony to the phantomatic nature of home. 2007 *Goter, and Trackers, Dundee Contemporary Arts, Dundee 2006 *Trackers, Max Wigram Gallery, London; Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, Herzliya; Kunsthalle Basel, Basel 2003 *Lost Time: Unrecognised, Self- Portrait, and Goter, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham [cat.] *Goter, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Tel Aviv [cat.] 2002 *Positioning, Hagar Art Gallery, Jaffa [cat.] *Unrecognised, el Kahif Gallery, Bethlehem *Five Senses, The Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre, Acre 2000 *Unrecognised, al Matal Cultural Center, Ramallah; Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation, Tel Aviv [cat.] 1999 *Wadi Salib in Nine Volumes, French Cultural Center, Ramallah; Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation, Tel Aviv [cat.] See also *Visual arts in Israel *Palestinian art References External links *Ahlam Shibli website Time Out interview *Ahlam Shibli, Arab al-Sbaih, purpose 7, spring 2008 Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Palestinian photographers Category:Palestinian women artists Category:Palestinian contemporary artists ","title":"Ahlam Shibli"},{"id":"12232313","text":"Brian Chikwava after a reading in NUI Maynooth.

It was formed in Karlsruhe on July 1, 1871.G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabr√ºck, 1993), Bd. 1, p. 124. The division was subordinated in peacetime to the XIV Army Corps (XIV. Armeekorps).Wegner, p. 43. The 28th Division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division, along with the other division of the XIV Army Corps, the 29th Division, was formed in the Grand Duchy of Baden, a member state of the German Empire. Both divisions grew out of the Grand Ducal Baden Division (Gro√üherzoglich Badische Division), the army of the grand duchy. The Grand Ducal Baden Division had fought against Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War, but after Prussia's victory Baden and most other German states had entered into conventions subordinating their armies to Prussia's. The Grand Ducal Baden Division served in the Franco-Prussian War against France in 1870-71, where its regiments saw action in the Siege of Strasbourg and the Battle of the Lisaine.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935) In peacetime, the 28th Division was stationed in northern Baden (the 29th covered southern Baden), with garrisons in Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Heidelberg and Rastatt, among other cities. In World War I, the division served primarily on the Western Front, seeing action at the Battle of the Frontiers and then moving north during the Race to the Sea. It participated in some of the most well-known battles and campaigns of the Western Front, including the 1916 Battle of the Somme, the later phases of the Battle of Verdun, the tank battle of Cambrai in 1917, the German Spring Offensive of 1918, the Third Battle of the Aisne, the Battle of Belleau Wood, the Second Battle of the Marne and the Battle of Soissons.

It demonstrates the higher technology in developed countries for fire prevention and to make the power lines less susceptible to outages during high wind thunderstorms or heavy snow or ice storms. An added benefit of undergrounding is the aesthetic quality of the landscape without the powerlines. Undergrounding can increase the initial costs of electric power transmission and distribution but may decrease operational costs over the lifetime of the cables. History The first uses of undergrounding had a basis in the detonation of mining explosives and undersea telegraph cables. Power cables were used in Russia to detonate mining explosives in 1812, and to carry telegraph signals across the English Channel in 1850. With the spread of early electrical power systems, undergrounding began to increase as well. Thomas Edison used underground DC ‚Äústreet pipes‚Äù in his early distribution networks; they were insulated first with jute in 1880, before progressing to rubber insulation in 1882. Subsequent developments occurred in both insulation and fabrication techniques: * 1925: Pressurized paper insulation used on cables * 1930: PVC insulation used on cables * 1942: Polyethylene insulation first used on cables * 1962: Ethylene propylene rubber-insulated cables become commercially available * 1963: Preformed cable accessories become available * 1970s: Shrinkable cable accessories become available During the 20th century direct-buried cable became commonplace.  Comparison  The aerial cables that carry high-voltage electricity and are supported by large pylons are generally considered an unattractive feature of the countryside. Underground cables can transmit power across densely populated areas or areas where land is costly or environmentally or aesthetically sensitive. Underground and underwater crossings may be a practical alternative for crossing rivers. = Advantages = * Less subject to damage from severe weather conditions (mainly lightning, hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons, tornados, other winds, and freezing) * Decreased risk of fire. Overhead power lines can draw high fault currents from vegetation-to-conductor, conductor-to-conductor, or conductor-to-ground contact, which result in large, hot arcs. * Reduced range of electromagnetic fields (EMF) emission, into the surrounding area. However, depending on the depth of the underground cable; greater EMF may be experienced on the surface.http://www.emfs.info/Sources+of+EMFs/Underground/ The electric current in the cable conductor produces a magnetic field, but the closer grouping of underground power cables reduces the resultant external magnetic field and further magnetic shielding may be provided. See Electromagnetic radiation and health. * Underground cables need a narrower surrounding strip of about 1‚Äì10 meters to install (up to 30 m for 400 kV cables during construction), whereas an overhead line requires a surrounding strip of about 20‚Äì200 meters wide to be kept permanently clear for safety, maintenance and repair. * Underground cables pose no hazard to low-flying aircraft or to wildlife. * Underground cables have a much reduced risk of damage caused by human activity such as theft, illegal connections, sabotage, and damage from accidents . * Burying utility lines makes room for more large trees on sidewalks,http://www.thestate.com/opinion/letters-to-the- editor/article41203599.html the trees conveying environmental benefits and increase of property values.http://www.americanforests.org/our- programs/urbanforests/ = Disadvantages = An underground cable marker. Markers are put at regular intervals to show the route and warn of the hazard of digging into the cable. *Undergrounding is more expensive, since the cost of burying cables at transmission voltages is several times greater than overhead power lines, and the life-cycle cost of an underground power cable is two to four times the cost of an overhead power line. Above-ground lines cost around $10 per foot and underground lines cost in the range of $20 to $40 per foot.Edison Electric Institute - Underground Vs. Overhead Distribution Wires: Issues to Consider In highly urbanized areas, the cost of underground transmission can be 10‚Äì14 times as expensive as overhead.Los Angeles Department of Water & Power System Development Division cost estimate data However, these calculations may neglect the cost of power interruptions. The lifetime cost difference is smaller for lower-voltage distribution networks, on the range of 12-28% higher than overhead lines of equivalent voltage. *Whereas finding and repairing overhead wire breaks can be accomplished in hours, underground repairs can take days or weeks,Should Power Lines be Underground? and for this reason redundant lines are run. *Underground cable locations are not always obvious, which can lead to unwary diggers damaging cables or being electrocuted. *Operations are more difficult since the high reactive power of underground cables produces large charging currents and so makes voltage control more difficult. Large charging currents arise due to the higher capacitance from underground power lines and thus limits how long an AC line can be. In order to avoid the capacitance issues when undergrounding long distance transmission lines, HVDC lines can be used as they do not suffer from the same issue. *Whereas overhead lines can easily be uprated by modifying line clearances and power poles to carry more power, underground cables cannot be uprated and must be supplemented or replaced to increase capacity. Transmission and distribution companies generally future-proof underground lines by installing the highest-rated cables while being still cost-effective. *Underground cables are more subject to damage by ground movement. The 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand caused damage to of high voltage underground cables and subsequently cut power to large parts of Christchurch city, whereas only a few kilometres of overhead lines were damaged, largely due to pole foundations being compromised by liquefaction. *As underground repair and check up require street digging, it creates patches and potholes, leading to bumpy and unsafe ride for cars and bicycles. Utility work also increase lane closure which leads to the traffic jam and increasing cost of resurfacing work by the local government . The advantages can in some cases outweigh the disadvantages of the higher investment cost, and more expensive maintenance and management. Methods *Horizontal Boring ‚Äì This is a method in which one uses a drill bit to bore horizontal starting at one point on the surface of the ground and creating an arc underground to come back out of the surface. This method is used when minimal damage to the surface is preferred. *Trench Undergrounding - The other method for undergrounding power lines is to dig trenches, lay power lines into the trench and cover them back up. This is done for the length of the power line. Regulations =Europe= The UK regulator Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) permits transmission companies to recoup the cost of some undergrounding in their prices to consumers. The undergrounding must be in National Parks or designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) to qualify. The most visually intrusive overhead cables of the core transmission network are excluded from the scheme. Some undergrounding projects are funded by the proceeds of national lottery. All low and medium voltage electrical power (<50 kV) in the Netherlands is now supplied underground. In Germany, 73% of the medium voltage cables are underground and 87% of low voltage cables are underground. The high percentage of underground cables contributes to the very high grid reliability (SAIDI < 20).http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_38837-544-1-30.pdf?140919123212 In comparison, the SAIDI value (minutes without electricity per year) in the Netherlands is about 30, and in the UK it is about 70. =California= In the United States, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Rule 20 permits the undergrounding of electrical power cables under certain situations. Rule 20A projects are paid for by all customers of the utility companies. Rule 20B projects are partially funded this way and cover the cost of an equivalent overhead system. Rule 20C projects enable property owners to fund the undergrounding. =Japan= Most electrical power in Japan is still distributed by aerial cables. In Tokyo's 23 wards, according to Japan's Construction and Transport Ministry, just 7.3 percent of cables were laid underground as of March 2008. Variants A compromise between undergrounding and using overhead lines is installing air cables. Aerial cables are insulated cables spun between poles and used for power transmission or telecommunication services. An advantage of aerial cables is that their insulation removes the danger of electric shock (unless the cables are damaged). Another advantage is that they forgo the costs‚Äîparticularly high in rocky areas‚Äîof burying. The disadvantages of aerial cables are that they have the same aesthetic issues as standard overhead lines and that they can be affected by storms. However, if the insulation is not destroyed during pylon failure or when hit by a tree, there is no interruption of service. Electrical hazards are minimised and re- hanging the cables may be possible without power interruption. A former pylon transformer south of Markgr√∂ningen, Germany. Today, the pylon carries only a switch fed by two underground cables.

It has the greatest wingspan of any living damselfly or dragonfly, up to 19 centimeters (7.5 inches) in the largest males. Its large size and the markings on its wings make it a conspicuous species; a hovering Megaloprepus has been described as a \\"pulsating blue-and-white beacon\\".Leigh, 38. As an adult it feeds on orb-weaver spiders in the forest understory, which it plucks from their webs. It lays its eggs in water-filled holes in trees; males defend the larger holes as breeding territories. The naiad is a top predator in its tree-hole habitat, feeding on tadpoles and aquatic insects, including the larvae of mosquito species that are vectors of human disease. M. caerulatus is the only species in genus Megaloprepus. Egg and naiad Megaloprepus lays its eggs in the water that collects in holes in trees. These plant-borne bodies of water, known as phytotelmata, may form in a living tree when a branch breaks off or a burl rots, or indentations in a trunk may fill with water after the tree falls. The eggs hatch in a minimum of 18 days, but the hatching of eggs laid on the same day is spread out over as much as half a year. This extreme variation in hatching time‚Äîunknown in any other damselfly‚Äîincreases the chance that some eggs will hatch when no predator is present.Fincke, \\"Population Ecology\\", 392, 403. As with other damselflies, the young‚Äîknown as naiads, nymphs, or larvae‚Äîare carnivorous. The most ubiquitous prey in the tree holes they inhabit are mosquito larvae, but they will also feed on tadpoles, syrphid fly and chironomid fly larvae, and other odonate (dragonfly and damselfly) naiads.Fincke, \\"Population Ecology\\", 393. The three leaflike caudal lamellae at the end of the abdomen, which serve as gills, are broad and elaborately folded, an adaptation to intermittent low oxygen availability in its habitat.Corbet, 82. Each lamella has a conspicuous white spot, making Megaloprepus easy to distinguish from other tree-hole damselflies.Fincke, \\"Interspecific Competition\\", 83. As many as 13 females may oviposit in a single large tree hole, laying up to 250 eggs each, but the numbers of naiads are reduced by cannibalism. Even when there is a high concentration of other prey, Megaloprepus naiads still kill each other until a density of one naiad per 1-2 liters of water is reached.Fincke, \\"Population Regulation\\", 118, 124. They are not territorial, but larger individuals displace smaller ones; their aggressive behavior includes raising and swinging the caudal lamellae and striking with the labium, the hinged, extensible lower \\"lip\\" that odonate naiads use to catch prey.Fincke, \\"Larval Behavior\\", 77-80. Adult The adult's body is dark brown or black and has yellowish markings. The wings are hyaline (transparent), with a dark blue band on the outer third. Females have a milky-tinged patch at the tip of each wing, while males of most populations have a white band just inside the blue one.Hedstr√∂m and Sahl√©n. In 1923, Philip Calvert described Megaloprepus in flight:Quoted in Waldbauer, 36. > When flying the four wings are spread quite far apart, fore and hind wing of > the same side far apart, body horizontal. Flight slow enough so that the > movements of each separate wing can be seen‚Äîinsect consequently moves slowly > but can dodge. Mr. Barnes compared the movements of the wings to that of a > windmill, but the revolving movements are lacking; I should say the effect > produced by the wings is more like that of a jumping-jack with moveable arms > and legs pulled by one string, rather slowly, but, of course, at regular > intervals. It is one of the few species in order Odonata in which males are larger than females,Fincke, \\"Population Ecology\\", 394. with abdomens up to 10 cm (4 in.) long and wingspans of up to 19 cm (7.5 in.)Groeneveld et al.‚Äîthe greatest wingspan of all odonates.Lewington and McGavin, 23. Size varies geographically; Megaloprepus on Barro Colorado Island in Panama are smaller than those at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica or Los Tuxtlas field station in the Mexican state of Veracruz.Fincke, \\"Use of Forest\\", 119. Adult lifespans as long as 7 months have been recorded.Fincke, \\"Population Regulation\\", 119. =Foraging= Like other pseudostigmatid damselflies, Megaloprepus feeds on web-building spiders. It forages in areas that receive direct sun, such as the gaps created by fallen trees or branches; the light helps it avoid becoming entangled.Fincke, \\"Use of Forest\\", 108; Srivastava et al., 76. When it finds a web, it hovers in front of it until it locates the spider. Then it flies backward and quickly darts forward again to grab the spider in its forelegs. Finally it backs away and perches to consume the spider, removing the legs before eating the body.Corbet, 355. =Reproduction= Most tree holes contain less than a liter of water, but some can hold as much as 50 liters. Male Megaloprepus defend these larger holes as breeding territories, mating with females who come to the tree hole to oviposit.Fincke, \\"Population Ecology\\", 392. Several factors make large tree holes more valuable to Megaloprepus than small ones. Not only can their greater volume accommodate more naiads at a time, they have a higher density of prey in the form of tadpoles and mosquito larvae; this allows the naiads to grow more rapidly and reach adulthood sooner. In forests with a dry season, larger tree holes can last nearly a month longer before drying out completely. As a result, large tree holes can produce three cohorts per season, totalling perhaps a few dozen new adults, while only one or two emerge from a small hole. Large tree holes also give Megaloprepus better chances of surviving to emerge if one of its slower-growing relatives in genus Mecistogaster is already present. In a tree hole small enough to be effectively patrolled by a single naiad, the first species to hatch is likely to eat all newcomers, but in a large one Megaloprepus can escape long enough to outgrow and eventually eat an older resident. Finally, probably due to the greater abundance of prey, larger tree holes produce larger males that will be better able to defend a territory themselves when they reach reproductive maturity.Fincke, \\"Use of Forest\\", 109; Fincke, \\"Consequences\\", 456. A territorial male drives away other males from his territory by chasing and sometimes hitting them. He does not allow females to lay eggs in the hole he defends without mating with him first, but he does not pursue females who opt instead to leave the scene. The structure of the penis suggests that, as with many other odonates, male Megaloprepus are able to displace sperm from previous matings, ensuring the paternity of the eggs. For their part, females do not choose mates based on size, and will sometimes remate with smaller males who cannot take over a territory and instead adopt a satellite position nearby. At least some females will lay eggs in undefended tree holes before mating again.Fincke, \\"Consequences\\", 450-455. Conservation Megaloprepus avoids flying across large clearings that lack shaded perches, and has poor flight endurance, achieving a maximum distance of less than 1 km when experimentally released over water. This may limit its dispersal ability, making it particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. While it can breed in secondary forest, it is less common there than in old-growth forest, even when the two are adjacent. Since Megaloprepus reduces the number of adult mosquitoes that emerge from tree holes it inhabits, and some of the species it preys on are important disease vectors, its conservation may have human health implications.Fincke, \\"Use of Forest\\", 103-120.

Sant'Angelo (officially Santa Maria degli Angeli) is a church in Milan, Lombardy, northern Italy, belonging to the Franciscan Order. History The church was constructed in the mid-16th century by the Spanish general and Governor Milan Ferrante Gonzaga, over an edifice already existing in 1418, in replacement of the eponymous one, which had been destroyed to build the new walls. The design was by Domenico Giunti. The small bell tower was added in 1607, while the fa√ßade was finished only in 1630, in late-Mannerist or early-Baroque style. The church is one of the few in the city which was not restored in \\"neo-medieval\\" style during the 19th century. It has a single nave with side chapels and barrel vault, a transept and a deep presbytery. Artworks include works by Gaudenzio Ferrari (chapel of St. Catherine, now replaced by a copy; the original is in the Pinacoteca di Brera), Antonio Campi (same chapel), Morazzone (a St. Charles Borromeo in Glory), Simone Peterzano (frescoes in the St. Anthony Chapel), Ottavio Semino (Brasca Chapel in the transept), Camillo Procaccini (frescoes in the transept and in several chapels) and Giulio Cesare Procaccini (a Nativity, in the Rococo-style sacristy). The triumphal arch has a frescoes with a solemn Incoronation of Mary by Stefano Maria Legnani (Legnanino). In the transept is the tomb of Blessed Beatrice Casati, the wife and widow of Francino Rusca, the Earl of Locarno. She raised four children‚Äîthree sons and one daughter, the latter of whom placed this monument to their mother‚Äîand was a devout member of the Franciscan tertiaries. She died in 1490. Her epitaph reads, ‚ÄúHere lies Beatrix, the shining jewel of the Rusca family, who was married to Count Francino. When she was left a widow, the sacred Franciscan Order sustained her in wonderful chastity under the shelter of your wings, and the Third Order provided her with a regime for living such that she rejoices with those who have been blessed by God above.‚Äù The convent is a 20th-century addition.

In South Vietnam, the coup was referred to as C√°ch m·∫°ng 1-11-63 (\\"1 November 1963 Revolution\\").http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n84-2413/ The Kennedy administration had been aware of the coup planning, but Cable 243 from the United States Department of State to U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., stated that it was U.S. policy not to try to stop it. Lucien Conein, the Central Intelligence Agency's liaison between the U.S. Embassy and the coup planners, told them that the U.S. would not intervene to stop it. Conein also provided funds to the coup leaders. The coup was led by General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh and started on 1 November. It proceeded smoothly as many loyalist leaders were captured after being caught off-guard and casualties were light. Di·ªám was captured and executed the next day along with his brother and adviser Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu. Background Di·ªám's road to political power began in July 1954 when he was appointed the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by former Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, who was Head of State. B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i disliked Di·ªám but selected him in the hopes that he would attract United States aid, but the two became embroiled in a power struggle. The issue was brought to a head when Di·ªám scheduled a referendum for October 1955, which was rigged by his brother Nhu, and proclaimed himself the President of the newly created Republic of Vietnam. He proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Di·ªám the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers.Jacobs, pp. 80‚Äì86. Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.Jacobs, pp. 111‚Äì14. Di·ªám kept the control of the nation firmly within the hands of his family, and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of loyalty rather than merit.Jacobs, pp. 86‚Äì95. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Di·ªám; in 1960, a paratrooper revolt was quashed after Di·ªám stalled for negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt,Moyar, pp. 110‚Äì15. while a 1962 palace bombing by two Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) pilots failed to kill him. South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Di·ªám's strong favoritism towards Roman Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US aid, business favors, and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics.Tucker, p. 291. The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform (i.e., appropriation). In the countryside, Catholics were de facto exempt from performing corv√©e labor, and in some rural areas, it was claimed that Catholic priests led private armies against Buddhist villages. In 1957, Di·ªám dedicated the nation to the Virgin Mary.Jacobs, pp. 89‚Äì92.Warner, p. 210.Fall, p. 199. Discontent with Di·ªám and Nhu exploded into mass protest during mid-1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Di·ªám's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. In response, the US government was concerned about the possibility \\"for the Dim/Nhu government to succeed and for us [the United States] to continue to support them.\\" The response by Ambassador Frederick Nolting was, \\"We should take it slow and easy and see if we can live with the Diem government.\\" As a result of this potential inability to support the Diem/Nhu government, the United States government discussed a proposed coup. In a telegram to the American Embassy in Saigon, Mr. Hilsman expresses that at some point should we need \\"political liquidation\\" we should also \\"urgently examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary.\\" In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively enforced; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, Di·ªám's brother. Many Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Di·ªám remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power.Jacobs, pp. 140‚Äì47. The key turning point came shortly after midnight on 21 August, when Nhu's ARVN Special Forces raided and vandalized Buddhist pagodas across the country, arresting thousands of monks and causing a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds., Jacobs, pp. 145‚Äì52.Halberstam, pp. 140‚Äì55. Numerous coup plans had been explored by the army before, but the plotters intensified their activities with increased confidence after the administration of US President John F. Kennedy authorized the US embassy to explore the possibility of a leadership change through Cable 243. They felt Di·ªám's policies were making their allied regime in Vietnam politically unsustainable.Jacobs, pp. 162‚Äì163.Karnow, pp. 303‚Äì304.Halberstam, pp. 157‚Äì158. Conspiracies There were many conspiracies against Di·ªám in 1963, many by different cliques of military officers independent from one another. According to the historian Ellen Hammer, there were \\"perhaps as many as six and possibly more\\" different plots,Hammer, p. 250. and these spanned the gamut of society to include civilian politicians, union leaders, and university students. =Plotting by mid-level officers= In mid-1963, one group was composed of mid-level officers such as colonels, majors, and captains. Colonel ƒê·ªó M·∫≠u director of military security was in this group, which was coordinated by Tr·∫ßn Kim Tuy·∫øn, South Vietnam's director of intelligence. Tuy·∫øn had been a palace insider, but a rift had developed in recent years, and he began plotting as early as 1962.Shaplen, p. 197. As South Vietnam was a police state, Tuy·∫øn was a powerful figure and had many contacts.Tucker, p. 407.Shaplen, p. 158. Another person in this group was Colonel Ph·∫°m Ng·ªçc Th·∫£o, an undetected communist agent who was deliberately fomenting infighting among the officers and mismanaging the Strategic Hamlet Program in order to destabilise the Saigon government.Tucker, p. 325. Tuy·∫øn's group had many officers who were members of the opposition Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng and ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng, who had been discriminated against on issues of promotions, which were preferentially given to members of the regime's secret C·∫ßn Lao Party, a secret Catholic organisation responsible for maintaining Di·ªám's grip on power.Dommen, p. 418.Hammer, pp. 131‚Äì33. These included commanders of airborne, marine and tank units from the 5th Division, mostly at battalion level.Shaplen, p. 198. When Tuy·∫øn's machinations were uncovered, he was exiled by Nhu.Shaplen, pp. 197‚Äì98. M·∫≠u and Th·∫£o took over but their initial coup plans for 15 July were shelved when American CIA officer Lucien Conein instructed Th·∫£o's superior, General Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m, the head of the ARVN, to stop the coup on the grounds that it was premature.Karnow, p. 300.Hammer, p. 264. Th·∫£o and M·∫≠u's group resumed plotting, intending to move on 24 October and they recruited a total of 3000 men. They augmented their forces with an assortment of officers from auxiliary units such as from the Signal Corps, Transportation Corps and some RVNAF pilots. M·∫≠u enlisted the help of Khi√™m following Tuy·∫øn's departure into exile. M·∫≠u gained the cooperation of an assortment of military and civilian dissidents known as the Military and Civilian Front for the Revolution in Vietnam (MCFRV). The MCFRV had started to plot independently in August and their leader was a cousin of M·∫≠u. Th·∫£o's 24 October coup was canceled after senior officers decided that their younger colleagues could not succeed without the help of General T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, a loyalist who controlled the III Corps. The generals sabotaged the younger officers by ordering one of their key regiments into the countryside to fight the communists.Jones, p. 398. The younger officers' plot was integrated into the generals' larger group,Tang, p. 52. and because Khi√™m and M·∫≠u were involved with both groups.Shaplen, p. 206. After the coup was completed, the media learned that the conspiracy organised by Tuy·∫øn and Th·∫£o had been more advanced than that of the generals' before the latter were integrated into the main plot. General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n threatened to have the younger officers arrested but M·∫≠u intervened to protect them.Hammer, p. 251. =Plotting by the generals= Following the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda raids, the senior generals started their own plot in earnest, having only had vague plans prior to this.Shaplen, p. 199. General ƒê√¥n, nominally a high-ranking general, but in a position without command of troops since the palace distrusted him, was sought out by M·∫≠u, who wanted to collaborate. M·∫≠u later accompanied the ranking general in the plot, D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, on recruitment campaigns.Hammer, p. 249. Despite his high rank, Minh was out of favour and served as the Presidential Military Advisor, a meaningless desk job where he had no subordinates in the field and no access to soldiers.Jones, p. 418. M·∫≠u helped Minh to secure the cooperation of General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh, who commanded the II Corps that oversaw the Central Highlands of the country, and Colonel Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, who commanded the 5th Division based just outside the capital in Bi√™n H√≤a.Tucker, pp. 526‚Äì33 According to Thi·ªáu, M·∫≠u and Minh had promised to establish a more strongly anti-communist government and to keep Di·ªám as a figurehead president.Hammer, p. 287. Recruitment of ƒê√≠nh The generals knew that without the cooperation of General ƒê√≠nh, a coup would be difficult as his III Corps forces oversaw the region surrounding the capital.Halberstam, p. 181. Regarded by his peers as ambitious, vain and impulsive,Karnow, pp. 307‚Äì22. ƒê√≠nh was a favorite of the Ng√¥ family, and headed the military wing of the C·∫ßn Lao Party.Wright, p. 40. ƒê√≠nh converted to Catholicism as Di·ªám trusted his co-religionists and promoted officers based on loyalty and not competence.Jacobs, pp. 88‚Äì95. ƒê√≠nh was known mainly for his drunken presence in Saigon's nightclubs,Jacobs, p. 169. and the CIA labeled him a \\"basic opportunist\\". ƒê√≠nh privately claimed responsibility for the pagoda attacks, stating to a journalist, \\"I have defeated Henry Cabot Lodge [the US ambassador to South Vietnam]. He came here to stage a coup d'√©tat, but I, T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, have conquered him and saved the country.\\"Halberstam, p. 147. During this period, ƒê√≠nh claimed he was \\"a great national hero\\". His ego had been played upon by the Ng√¥ brothers, who reiterated this point and paid him a large cash bonus after the pagoda raids.Sheehan, pp. 356‚Äì57. In the heady times after the attacks, ƒê√≠nh told his American advisors that \\"he was without doubt the greatest general officer in the ARVN, the saviour of Saigon ... and soon he would be the top military man in the country\\".Catton, p. 203. In a press conference soon after, ƒê√≠nh claimed to have saved South Vietnam from \\"foreign adventurers\\", a euphemism for the United States. After being questioned sharply, ƒê√≠nh quickly became angry. Ray Herndon of United Press International (UPI) asked him to name the country that he was referring to, but ƒê√≠nh dodged the question. Herndon lampooned him by saying that a national hero should be able to identify the national enemy, and asked him to call Madame Nhu, the country's First Lady known for her anti-American comments, to get help in identifying the hostile country in question. After several reporters derisively laughed at his comments, ƒê√≠nh angrily stormed out of the conference.Halberstam, p. 182. ƒê√≠nh returned to the officers' mess at the Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters and his colleagues attempted to play on ƒê√≠nh's ego to convince him to join their plot. In a series of meetings, the other generals assured ƒê√≠nh that he was a national hero worthy of political authority, and claimed that Nhu had not realised how important he was in the future of the country. ƒê√≠nh's colleagues even bribed his soothsayer to predict his elevation to political power.Halberstam, pp. 182‚Äì83. The other generals told him that the people were dissatisfied with Di·ªám's cabinet and that Vietnam needed dynamic young officers in politics, and that their presence would reverse the declining morale in the ARVN. They advised ƒê√≠nh to ask Di·ªám to promote him to Interior Minister, D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh to Defence Minister, and Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Minh to Education Minister. ƒê√≠nh and his fellow generals met Di·ªám at the palace, where ƒê√≠nh asked the president to promote him to the post of Interior Minister. Di·ªám bluntly chastised ƒê√≠nh in front of his colleagues, and ordered him out of Saigon to the Central Highlands resort town of ƒê√† L·∫°t to rest. ƒê√≠nh was humiliated and embarrassed, having promised his colleagues he would be successful. The Ng√¥ brothers had been alarmed by ƒê√≠nh's request, and put him under surveillance. ƒê√≠nh found out, further straining his relationship with the palace. ƒê√≠nh agreed to join the coup, although with his ambitious nature, the other officers were skeptical and planned to have him assassinated if he tried to switch sides. Without ƒê√≠nh's troops, the coup would not have been possible. =Nhu's counter-plot= By mid-October, Di·ªám and Nhu were aware that a group of ARVN generals and colonels were planning a coup, but did not know that ƒê√≠nh was firmly among them, although they grew wary of him after his request for a cabinet post.Karnow, p. 318. Nhu then made a plan to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided that they had to counteract him. The other generals were still suspicious of ƒê√≠nh and whether he would betray them to the palace. Having found out that ƒê√≠nh would be recruited for Nhu's plan, and not sure which side he was really on, they promised to make him Interior Minister and other rewards if they helped to overthrow the Ng√¥ family. Having gained a reassurance from ƒê√≠nh, the generals placated the younger officers, whose coup had been integrated into their plans. As part of the generals' plot, ƒê√≠nh sent Colonel Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu C√≥, his deputy corps commander, to M·ªπ Tho to talk to the 7th Division commander, Colonel (later Major General) B√πi ƒê√¨nh ƒê·∫°m, and two regimental commanders, the armoured unit commander, both of the 7th Division, and the M·ªπ Tho region provincial chief. Exhorting them to join the coup on the grounds that Di·ªám's regime was unable to keep the military going forward, he stated that all the generals except Cao were in the plot, while ƒê√≠nh was going to do so. According to one account, ƒê√≠nh intended for loyalists to report C√≥'s activities to Di·ªám and Nhu so that it would give him an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate himself with the palace. Nhu's agents heard of the conversation and reported to the palace. When the Ng√¥ brothers confronted ƒê√≠nh with the report of what had happened in M·ªπ Tho, ƒê√≠nh feigned astonishment at his deputy's behaviour. He began crying and said > This is my fault, because you have suspected me. I have not really gone to > work for the last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. But I > am not against you. I was sad because I thought I was discredited with you. > So Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu C√≥ profited from my absence to make trouble. ƒê√≠nh claimed to know nothing of C√≥'s activities, raising his voice, vowing to have his deputy killed.Moyar, p. 265. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted C√≥ alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use ƒê√≠nh to achieve this. Despite their distrust of ƒê√≠nh, the Ng√¥ brothers told them this was not the case and that they would promote him. Nhu ordered ƒê√≠nh and Tung,Karnow, p. 317. both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the Ng√¥ family. One of Nhu's objectives was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated.Jones, pp. 398‚Äì99. Another objective of the public relations stunt was to give the public a false impression of the strength of the Ng√¥ regime. Codenamed \\"Operation Bravo\\", the first stage of the scheme would involve some of Tung's loyalist soldiers, disguised as insurgents led by apparently renegade junior officers, faking a coup and vandalising the capital.Hatcher, p. 149. During the orchestrated chaos of the first coup, the disguised loyalists would riot and in the ensuing mayhem, kill the leading coup plotters, such as Generals D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n, L√™ VƒÉn Kim and junior officers that were helping them. The loyalists and some of Nhu's underworld connections were also to kill some figures who were assisting the conspirators, such as the titular but relatively powerless Vice President Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆°, CIA agent Lucien Conein, who was on assignment in South Vietnam as a military adviser, and Lodge. Buddhist and student dissident leaders would also be targeted. These would be blamed on \\"neutralist and pro- communist elements\\".Sheehan, p. 368. Tung would then announce the formation of a \\"revolutionary government\\" consisting of opposition activists who had not consented to being named in the government, while Di·ªám and Nhu would pretend to be on the run and move to V≈©ng T√†u. A fake \\"counter-coup\\" was to follow, whereby Tung's men, having left Saigon on the pretext of fighting the Viet Cong (VC), as well as ƒê√≠nh's forces, would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to reaffirm the Di·ªám regime. Nhu would then round up opposition figures.Tucker, pp. 291‚Äì98.Karnow, p. 319. ƒê√≠nh, now a double agent, was put in charge of the fake coup and was allowed the additional control of the 7th Division, which was previously assigned to Di·ªám loyalist General Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao, who was in charge of the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta. The reassignment of the 7th Division to ƒê√≠nh gave his III Corps complete encirclement of Saigon. The encirclement would prevent Cao from storming the capital to save Di·ªám as he had done during the 1960 coup attempt. This arrangement was supposed to make ƒê√≠nh's task of serving the regime easier, but it was exploited to bring down the Ng√¥ family.Hatcher, pp. 145‚Äì46. Nhu and Tung remained unaware of ƒê√≠nh's allegiance to the rebels, and were fooled. ƒê√≠nh told Tung that the fake coup needed to employ an overwhelming amount of force. He said that tanks were required \\"because armour is dangerous\\". ƒê√≠nh said that fresh troops were needed in the capital,Jones, p. 399. opining, \\"If we move reserves into the city, the Americans will be angry. They'll complain that we're not fighting the war. So we must camouflage our plan by sending the special forces out to the country. That will deceive them.\\" Nhu had no idea that ƒê√≠nh's real intention was to engulf Saigon with rebel units and lock Tung's loyalists in the countryside where they could not defend the Ng√¥s. Nhu's coup would take place on 1 November, All Saints' Day, when Catholics prepare for All Souls' Day, which follows the next day. This was so that troops could move freely through the streets, which would be carrying less traffic. The generals decided to start their real coup on the same day to try to exploit ƒê√≠nh's liaison with Nhu. Colonel ƒê·ªó M·∫≠u, one of the conspirators, concocted military intelligence reports with false data that claimed that the VC were massing outside the capital for an offensive. He convinced Di·ªám and Nhu to send the special forces out of the capital to fight the VC.Hammer, p. 273. Tung and Nhu agreed to send all four Saigon-based special forces companies out of Saigon on 29 October. Another of Di·ªám's brothers, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh C·∫©n, began to suspect M·∫≠u and told the palace, which told army chief General Khi√™m to have M·∫≠u arrested. However, Khi√™m, who was also part of the plot, deliberately procrastinated and M·∫≠u remained free. In the meantime, it was too late for the brothers to bring their loyalists back into the capital. Not trusting C√≥, Di·ªám put Colonel L√¢m VƒÉn Ph√°t in command of the 7th Division on 31 October. According to tradition, Ph√°t had to pay the Corps' commander a courtesy visit before assuming control of the division. ƒê√≠nh refused to see Ph√°t and told him to come back on Friday at 14:00, by which time the coup would have been in progress. In the meantime, ƒê√≠nh had ƒê√¥n sign a counter-order transferring command of the 7th Division to C√≥. Rebel troop movements in and around Saigon The insurgent plans were based on three main task forces. The first consisted of two battalions of marines and a company of M-113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs). Two battalions of airborne troops regarded as being pro-Di·ªám were moved to B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province to the north of the capital and replaced with the two marine battalions. The marines and the paratroopers were South Vietnam's strategic reserve and were usually deployed near Saigon for protecting the regime against any coups. Another task force consisted of the 6th Airborne Battalion, which was based in V≈©ng T√†u around 70 km southwest of the capital, and a trainee battalion, supplemented by 12 APCs from the armor school at Long H·∫£i. The final task force consisted of the 2nd Battalion, 9th Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 7th Regiment of the 5th Division of Colonel Thi·ªáu. The troops involved in the operations in Saigon began preparing to move into the capital on the evening before the coup and in the early morning. The second task force moved in from the southeast and converged with the other two moving in from the north, and some rebel elements from the 7th Division from the southwest.Jones, p. 408. By noon, thousands of rebel soldiers had assembled on the city's outskirts, checking equipment and weapons and receiving last-minute orders. Three marine battalions in tanks and armored cars had moved toward the Saigon city center to spearhead the revolt, and some of the 7th Division had arrived from the Mekong Delta to cut the main road from the south into T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Air Base. The enlisted men did not know the truth behind their mission, nor did many lower-ranking officers; the senior officers told them that they were crushing a police revolt. One airborne lieutenant was suspicious, and as they moved into the suburbs, a colonel revealed that their objective was the C·ªông H√≤a barracks of the Presidential Guard. When the lieutenant asked \\"Who is the enemy and who our friend?\\", the colonel retorted \\"Anyone who opposes us is the enemy\\". The task forces were used to man various parts of the city, guarding the howitzers to be used in the siege of loyalist installations, and to protect the headquarters of Colonel Thi·ªáu. ƒê√≠nh had 20 tanks brought to his III Corps headquarters at Camp L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát. In all, the conspirators had 40 tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Lodge, Harkins and Felt meet with Di·ªám At 10:00 on 1 November, Lodge, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) commander General Paul D. Harkins and Admiral Harry D. Felt, the commander of US forces in the Pacific region, were invited to Gia Long Palace by Di·ªám. ƒê√¥n had scheduled the meeting for the visiting Felt at that time to keep Di·ªám occupied as the troops were moved in and to keep the president in Saigon.Prochnau, p. 464. They were accompanied by ƒê√¥n, whose desk job meant that his duties consisted mainly of meeting visiting military dignitaries.Prochnau, pp. 462‚Äì66. Di·ªám gave one of his chain-smoking monologues and said that he would cooperate with US recommendations. According to Lodge, however, Di·ªám was more direct and to the point than usual. Di·ªám recounted to Felt about the Ng√¥ family's achievements, then complained about American aid cuts in response to the pagoda raids. He blamed the generals, claiming they had attacked the Buddhists, not the special forces, and claimed Tung's men were now under ARVN control and not used as a private army, which was false. Di·ªám also claimed that aid cutbacks had hindered the army and led to food shortages.Hammer, p. 282. At one stage, Di·ªám said \\"I know there is going to be a coup attempt, but I don't know who is going to do it\\", to which Lodge purportedly replied \\"I don't think that there is anything to worry about\\". Di·ªám then asked Lodge to talk to officials in Washington about Nhu's future; Di·ªám was still refusing to remove his brother from authority. He said \\"Please tell President Kennedy I am a good and frank ally, that I would rather be frank and settle questions than talk about them after we have lost everything. Tell President Kennedy that I take all his suggestions very seriously and wish to carry them out but it is a question of timing.\\"Moyar, p. 266. Lodge did not discuss anything specific with regards to a regime change, but claimed that he was not worried by rumors that Di·ªám and Nhu had wanted to assassinate him. Lodge expressed his \\"admiration and personal friendship\\" and gratitude for Di·ªám's hospitality. As Harkins and Felt prepared to leave, Di·ªám took Lodge aside for an individual discussion and repeatedly asked what the Americans wanted, repeating his request for 20 minutes. This was a trick on Diem's part, as the fake coup was about to start. In reference to a United Nations inquiry over his repression of the Buddhists, Di·ªám claimed that Buddhists had been brainwashed by the Americans. Di·ªám claimed he had closed the pagodas because among the students were communists about to throw grenades and perpetrate bombings during the UN visit. The president also claimed that some Americans were planning a coup against him and promised to give Lodge names. The American ambassador replied with a poker face that he was committed to removing any of his countrymen who were involved in plotting, even though he was doing so himself.Hammer, p. 283. Lodge was not taken in by Di·ªám, as Washington had already told Di·ªám what reforms were necessary, such as the removal of Nhu and the use of the special forces to fight communists rather than dissidents; Di·ªám had not responded to US advice. Lodge knew that the real coup was in the offing and did not want to stop it, even if Di·ªám's overtures were genuine.Jones, p. 420. Felt was unaware of impending eventsas was Harkinsand hurried to T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Air Base for his noon flight. Before leaving, he held a press conference with Harkins and ƒê√¥n while the rebels were rolling into the city. Harkins spoke about the military situation with optimism; on the morning of the coup, the front page of the Stars and Stripes, a military newspaper, featured a piece with Harkins' sunny outlook, entitled \\"Viet Victory Near\\".Prochnau, pp. 260‚Äì61. While Felt and Harkins were talking, the officers were preparing to launch the coup at a lunchtime meeting at military headquarters next to the airport. Thinking of the situation, ƒê√¥n kept glancing at his watch while waiting for Felt to fly out. The three men were standing as they talked, and ƒê√¥n, overcome by nerves, chewed his gum \\"like a threshing machine\\", and could not stand still, frequently changing his footing as he talked.Prochnau, p. 468. After Felt left, the runway was closed, and ƒê√¥n brushed off Harkins and quickly went away to get ready for the coup. Up to the last minute, Harkins and Felt remained unaware of the imminent coup, despite ƒê√¥n's fidgety behaviour. The pair had paid a visit to ƒê√¥n to discuss military issues at 09:15, but instead of the Vietnamese general hosting his American visitors as Joint General Staff headquarters, as was the norm, ƒê√¥n went to the MACV office.Hammer, p. 280. Although Felt was surprised, the Americans did not realise the reason for the unusual venue and then pointed at a map and wondered why two airborne battalions appeared to be idling. ƒê√¥n replied that they were going into battle, and Harkins nodded, unaware that they were entering Saigon. Harkins had told the generals earlier that he opposed a coup, so ƒê√¥n avoided the topic. Felt had been told of the existence of coup plans by Lodge, who falsely informed him that it was not imminent, saying \\"There isn't a Vietnamese general with hair enough on his chest to make it go.\\" Felt later said that ƒê√¥n appeared to be calm and composed.Hammer, p. 281. Final preparations =Distrust= On the morning of the coup, there was still some trepidation among the plotters. Khi√™m approached ƒê√≠nh and asked him to keep their conversation confidential. After the III Corps commander agreed, Khi√™m claimed that he wanted to cancel the coup, saying \\"ƒê√≠nh, I think we still have time to talk to the old man. I don't want to hurt him. Have pity on him!\\" ƒê√≠nh contemplated the situation and said that he would still proceed with the overthrow. Khi√™m reported this to ƒê√¥n, and claimed that he had placed Chinese medicinal oil into his eyes to irritate and redden them and thus give the appearance he had become remorseful about the coup, in order to test ƒê√≠nh's loyalty to the plot. Both Minh and ƒê√¥n were wary of Khi√™m and ƒê√≠nh up to the last minute, as the latter were both Catholics who were favourites of the Ng√¥ family, who had been rewarded for their loyalty, rather than competence. Khi√™m was Di·ªám's godson. The other generals remained worried that ƒê√≠nh might switch sides and go through with the second part of Nhu's fake coup. The generals were also concerned that they would not have enough forces to overcome the loyalists. =Premature start= The first victim of the coup was Captain H·ªì T·∫•n Quy·ªÅn, Di·ªám's loyalist Republic of Vietnam Navy (RVNN) commander, who was shot dead on his 36th birthday before noon.Hammer, p. 284. There are varying accounts of Quy·ªÅn's death. According to Stanley Karnow, Quy·ªÅn had noticed abnormal troop movements and drove off to discuss the matter with a colleague. A jeep of rebel marines followed and intercepted him by overtaking him and blocking the road. Quy·ªÅn abandoned his vehicle and ran across the open field, but stumbled and fell with the marines in hot pursuit. One of them reached him and shot him in the head point blank.Karnow, p. 320. According to Ellen Hammer, however, Quy·ªÅn started his birthday with an early morning tennis match with fellow officers, who invited him to a lunchtime birthday party. Quy·ªÅn declined in order to look after his children who were at home alone while his wife was studying in Japan. His deputy, who was part of the plot, followed him home and managed to change Quy·ªÅn's mind. The two men headed for a restaurant on Saigon's outskirts, and the shooting took place along the way. Historian and author Mark Moyar wrote that Quy·ªÅn noticed suspicious troop movements near the capital in the morning. As Quy·ªÅn prepared to go to the palace to alert the Ng√¥ brothers, his deputy shot him dead on the Bi√™n H√≤a highway. The generals were immediately informed of the killing and forced to bring forward intended troop movements into Saigon ahead of schedule. =Capture of loyalist officers= On 1 November, the plotters summoned many senior officers who were not involved in the plot to the JGS headquarters at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t, on the pretext of a routine lunchtime leadership meeting.Moyar, p. 267. M·∫≠u and ƒê√¥n organised the invitations and set up the trap. At 13:45, ƒê√¥n announced that a coup was taking place.Hammer, p. 285. Most of the officers rose to applaud, while those who did not and refused to turn against Di·ªám were arrested. The plotters neutralised many Di·ªám loyalists in this manner, most notably Colonel Tung, who was taken away by Captain Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nhung, Minh's bodyguard. As he was led away, Tung angrily denounced the generals, shouting \\"Remember who gave you your stars!\\" During the early stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender by putting a pistol to his head and forcing him to make a phone call to his subordinates. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Di·ªám on the phone, telling the president that he had told his men to stand down, but Tung failed to convince the president to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute Tung as he still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for the special forces commander as he had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids.Hammer, p. 290. The generals were well aware of the threat that Tung posed; they had discussed and agreed on his elimination during their planning,Karnow, p. 310.Jones, p. 325. having contemplated waging an offensive against Tung's special forces.Jones, p. 388. At nightfall Tung was taken with Major L√© Quang Trieu, his brother and deputy,Karnow, p. 321. hands tied, into a jeep and driven to edge of the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.Jones, p. 414. Another leading officer who stayed loyal to Di·ªám was Colonel Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n, commander of the airborne brigade. Vi√™n had been unaware of the plot, and the generals had discussed whether to assassinate him during their planning phase because they knew he was a Di·ªámist.Hung, p. 79. However, ƒê√≠nh, who played mahjong with Vi√™n's wife, convinced Minh to not have Vi√™n liquidated, and promised that Vi√™n would not oppose the coup. ƒê√≠nh's prediction that Vi√™n would acquiesce was incorrect. Vi√™n \\"broke down completely\\" and took off his insignia and handed it to Minh in resignation. He was then taken into custody, and sentenced to death.Tucker, p. 62. Vi√™n had planned with Di·ªám to allow the president to take refuge at his home in the event of a coup, but the offer was moot as rebels surrounded Vi√™n's house after taking him into custody. Vi√™n narrowly avoided execution and was released and returned to command after the coup. General Khang, the commander of the marine brigade, was also put under arrest for remaining loyal to Di·ªám, as was the head of the RVNAF ƒê·ªó Kh·∫Øc Mai, and the National Police chief. After the loyalists were taken away, Minh read the coup proclamation and his objectives and taped it and asked the other officers to sign the papers. They then spoke into the recorder, identifying themselves as supporters of the coup. Minh told his subordinates to have copies made of the original, and hid the copies in several places so that his accomplices could not claim that they were not involved if the putsch failed. Minh was to play them over the radio later that day.Jones, pp. 408‚Äì09. Seizing control of the 7th Division With a group of his personal rebel officers, C√≥ flew by helicopter to M·ªπ Tho, the division headquarters, to take command on the morning of the coup. Reaching the Mekong Delta town two hours before the scheduled start of the coup, he held a ceremony for the division's incumbent officerswho thought the change of command was a routine matterin a local hall. When the coup started, C√≥'s men charged through the doors with automatic guns and arrested the officers, before taking command. He said \\"Please remain seated quietly. Anyone who rises will be instantly shot\\". C√≥ then phoned Cao, further south in the Mekong Delta's largest town C·∫ßn Th∆°, where the IV Corps was headquartered. The rebel colonel assured Cao that the divisional and corps transfer had taken place smoothly. C√≥, a central Vietnamese, was afraid that Cao, a Mekong Delta native would recognise his fake southern accent, and realize that he was impersonating Phat, another southerner. However, Cao did not notice. When Cao was informed by his subordinates that there was a coup occurring in the capital, he believed it to be part of the false coup, as he had been told beforehand by Nhu; Cao was one of the regime's most loyal and favourites generals and he was going to help stage the second part of Nhu's plan. Cao told one regiments and a few tanks to ready themselves for the second part of the plot. Later, Cao realised it was a genuine coup. He sent the 9th Division under Colonel B√πi Dzinh to move north through M·ªπ Tho towards Saigon to save Di·ªám, but C√≥ had already made plans to cut off any attempt by Cao to relieve Saigon.Moyar, p. 270. When Cao radioed the 7th Division in M·ªπ Tho, C√≥ identified himself and taunted the corps commander, saying \\"Didn't you recognise my accent?\\". C√≥ told the general that he had ordered all the ferries to the Saigon side of the Mekong River, and told Cao not to attempt to cross unless he wanted to die. Seeing that Di·ªám was lost, Cao later expressed solidarity with the coup.Jones, p. 409. Fighting in Saigon The rebels encountered little resistance at the start of the attack on Saigon, and this allowed them to generate momentum. This was primarily to Di·ªám and Nhu's complacency and mistaken assumption that the military action was the start of Operation Bravo. The central police called Di·ªám, informing him that the marines did not appear to be friendly. It was too late as the rebels captured the police headquarters and shut down the secret police, which were directly controlled by Nhu.Jones, p. 410. Wearing red scarves for identification, the rebel marines caught the loyalists off guard and took over control of the building of the Interior Ministry and the National Police headquarters.Jones, p. 407. The latter installation was captured by some newly enlisted troops from the Quang Trung Training Camp, led by General Mai H·ªØu Xu√¢n, who promptly arrested the Diem supporters in the office. The rebels also tried to take control of the Infantry School in Saigon so that they could use the two trainee battalions against Di·ªám, but the loyalist head of the institution, Colonel Lam Son, foiled their plans. One of Di·ªám's aides called ƒê√≠nh but was told that ƒê√≠nh was not there. Di·ªám and Nhu remained relaxed, confident that it was the phony coup. When security officials noticed the troop movements, a panicked young officer telephoned Nhu, who serenely said. \\"It's all right, I know about it.\\" The generals timed the coup to trick Nhu and Di·ªám, who were always paranoid about threats to their power, into believing that the threat was false. The rebels outnumbered the Di·ªámists and quickly made inroads against the loyalists, who were caught unawares and confused about whether the coup was real. The generals wanted and needed to finish the operation quickly with as little hand-to-hand combat as possible, as they knew that both factions would have to put aside their differences and regroup to fight the communists after the coup, and because a drawn out mini-civil war would only allow the communists to take over the countryside while the ARVN fought in the capital. Minh had decided to keep the loyalists in their rank afterward if they still wanted to fight the VC. Furthermore, a drawn-out conflict would benefit the VC. Most of the anti-Di·ªám forces also wanted to avoid killing the president in a large-scale battle for the palace. The rebels quickly took control of T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t to control air traffic, and set up checkpoints and defense installations on the cities' outskirts to guard against any counterattack that might come from outside the capital. They also blew up government buildings, and took control of the national post office and Radio Saigon. Four RVNAF AD-6 fighter-bombers roared above the city centre, adding to the confusion and threatening loyalist positions.Jones, pp. 409‚Äì12. Lieutenant Colonel Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, the RVNAF deputy commander, sent two T-28 fighter-bombers over Saigon. They strafed the palace, and fired two rockets while avoiding sporadic black and white clouds of antiaircraft fire. Both shots missed their targets, and the second struck an empty US Marine barracks.Jones, p. 412. At the same time, some fighter-bombers made strafing runs at the RVNN headquarters in the capital, where the defenders remained loyal to Di·ªám. Some anti-aircraft guns on the RVNN vessels patrolling in the Saigon River returned fire. Around 15 minutes after the start of the coup, radio transmissions were taken off the air, severing communication with those outside Saigon. Early on during the coup, while the special forces were still fighting before the generals forced Tung to order them to capitulate, one of his subordinates was in Gia Long Palace made a proposal to Di·ªám. According to the diary of one of Di·ªám's aides, the special forces officer drew up and proposed a surprise counter-attack on the rebel headquarters at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t using loyalist infantry and tanks.Moyar, p. 268. T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t was located on the northwestern edge of the city, and the officer said that it was only protected by trainee soldiers. He told Di·ªám there was no chance that the new recruits could resist a loyalist attack and therefore the generals would be easily captured and the leadership of the coup would break down. The aide reported that Di·ªám turned down the proposal, saying \\"The brigade should conserve its forces to fight the communists and avoid bloodshed. In the meantime, it should protect Gia Long Palace, the post office and the treasury.\\" Another aide believed that Di·ªám did not want to attack the headquarters of the JGS because \\"it represented the authority of the armed forces\\" and to avoid \\"more harm, more death, more suffering for the soldiers\\".Moyar, p. 269. According to this account, Di·ªám \\"was confident that his forbearance would make the coup forces realize that he was a president who always stood on the side of the masses of the population\\". To stop the loyalist forces near the palace from escaping, armoured and artillery units commanded by Colonel Thi·ªáu placed their tanks and howitzers shoulder-to- shoulder, in preparation for the shelling of the C·ªông H√≤a barracks of the Presidential Guard, located near the palace. APCs brought more rebel troops with machine guns to surround the C·ªông H√≤a Barracks, where the defenders were armed with artillery, mortars and machine guns.Jones, pp. 409‚Äì10. Under the command of Thi·ªáu, the siege of the barracks started, and rebel artillery shells soon reduced the buildings to rubble, but the pro-Di·ªám loyalists fought on, a scant five blocks from the palace. Presidential Guard tanks returned fire, severely damaging nearby roadways.Jones, pp. 410‚Äì12. After an hour, Di·ªám and Nhu suspected that something was amiss and attempted to call ƒê√≠nh's office for a second time and again were told ƒê√≠nh was not there. Not believing ƒê√≠nh had double-crossed them, the Ng√¥ brothers were heard in the background speculating that ƒê√≠nh had been arrested by the rebels. The generals then phoned Gia Long Palace with an ultimatum. If Di·ªám resigned immediately, he and Nhu would be safely exiled. If he did not, they would launch air strikes and start shelling the palace within the hour. The generals said that there would be no negotiation, only a yes or no would be acceptable. Di·ªám made no reply. Shortly after 16:00, Di·ªám telephoned JGS headquarters. ƒê√¥n answered and stated \\"the time has come when the army must respond to the wishes of the people\\" because Di·ªám had failed to reform his leadership. The pair had a robust argument and Di·ªám asked the commanders to visit him the palace to negotiate and work on a reform plan. The generals, remembering that he bought time for loyalists to come to his aid during the 1960 coup attempt by stalling the coup with talks and a false promise of reform and power-sharing, turned down his suggestion. At 16:30, the generals officially announced the coup over national radio, repeating the recorded message at five-minute intervals. Their message called on Di·ªám and Nhu to give up power, and many officers identified themselves as participants. The recorded pledges made at JGS were also played. Minh said \\"The day the people have been waiting for has come. For eight years, the people of Vietnam have suffered under the rotten, nepotic Diem regime, but now the armed forces have come to their rescue.\\" It further said \\"Soldiers in the army, security service, civil defense force, and people's force ... The Ngo Dinh Diem government, abusing power, has thought only of personal ambition and slighted the fatherland's interests ... The army has swung into action. The task of you all is to unite ... The revolution will certainly be successful.\\" The proclamation was endorsed by 14 generals, 7 colonels and a major. It further added that \\"We have no political ambitions ... We act not for fame or benefit, but to save our beloved fatherland.\\" However a technical malfunction interrupted the broadcasts with twist and cha-cha music; under the Di·ªám regime Madame Nhu had banned dancing and associated music under a series of \\"morality laws\\". In the meantime, RVNAF transport planes dropped rebel leaflets over Saigon, asking the population to rally to the anti-Di·ªám cause. Concurrent to the generals' radio broadcast, Di·ªám telephoned Lodge at the US Embassy. Di·ªám angrily shouted in French, and Lodge had to hold the receiver away from his ear. Di·ªám's voice was loud enough that Lodge's aides could hear the message from a distance. Lodge reported the following exchange to Washington: It later emerged, however, that Lodge had not given a full account of the conversation to his superiors at the State Department. The Australian historian Anne E. Blair said \\"there can be no doubt that Lodge silenced some of Di·ªám's rejoinder, supremely confident as he was in his ability to control not only the American press by the official government records as well\\".Blair, p. 69. Lodge's aide, Frederick Flott, claimed that in the middle of the conversation Lodge offered to send his staff to Di·ªám's palace to have the Ng√¥ brothers taken to the airport and safely exiled and exhorted him to leave. Lodge wanted to send Flott to the palace in a taxi marked with American flags, to negotiate his way into the building and take the brothers to the airport,Jones, p. 413. where he would be flown aboard an American aircraft to a military base in the Philippines. Di·ªám mistakenly presumed that Lodge's offer implied American reinforcements against the coup. One account from a US embassy official added the following passage, omitted by Lodge. Di·ªám's bodyguard would claim decades later that the president further said:Jacobs, p. 2. Through the afternoon and into the night, the loudspeakers on the grounds of Gia Long Palace carried Di·ªám's recorded exhortation to loyalists that \\"We shall not give in\\". These were mixed with passages of military music. At the same time, the US military ordered units of the Seventh Fleet to move into the waters near Saigon as a \\"precautionary measure\\" in case the fighting endangered Americans lives and to deter an opportunistic communist offensive. Siege of Gia Long Palace Gia Long Palace, the presidential mansion had once served as the home of French governor general. For security reasons, the surrounding streets were regularly sealed after sunset, the building had many bunkers and an intricate tunnel system, including a half-block long escape route to the basement of the City Hall. On the morning of 1 November, Di·ªám had reinforced palace security with more soldiers and barbed-wire barricades. The palace was surrounded by walls of around 2.1 m, and defended by 150 troops of the Presidential Guard. The building was protected by machine and antiaircraft guns, ringed with pillboxes, tanks, and 20-mm cannons mounted on armoured vehicles. As Di·ªám refused to surrender, vowing to reassert his control, after sunset, Thi·ªáu led his 7th Division in an assault on Gia Long Palace. They used artillery and flamethrowers and it fell by daybreak after Di·ªám finally gave the order to the Presidential Guard to surrender.Jones, pp. 412‚Äì15. The coup results pleased the anti-Di·ªámists. The casualties were light: 9 insurgents killed and 46 wounded, 4 dead and 44 injured Presidential Guards. The greatest casualties were from the populace, who suffered 20 deaths and 146 injured.Jones, p. 419. I Corps When I Corps commander General ƒê·ªó Cao Tr√≠ was informed that coup was imminent, he left Hu·∫ø on 29 October for ƒê√† N·∫µng so that he would be away from Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh C·∫©n, who ruled central Vietnam from Hue for his family. The coup took place on 1 November, and Tr√≠ helped to prevent any loyalist actions by causing diversions. He scheduled a meeting with the province chief and other pro-Di·ªám officials during the time that the coup was to take place. As a result, Di·ªám loyalists were stuck in a meeting room and were unable to mobilise the Republican Youth and other Ng√¥ family paramilitary and activist groups.Hammer, pp. 285‚Äì86. Surrender and execution of Di·ªám and Nhu In the early morning of 2 November 1963 Di·ªám agreed to surrender. The ARVN officers had a meeting intended to exile Di·ªám and Nhu, having promised the Ng√¥ brothers safe passage out of the country into an \\"honorable retirement\\". Not all of the senior officers attended the meeting. General Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc L√™ strongly lobbied for Di·ªám's execution. There was no formal vote taken at the meeting, and L√™ attracted only minority support.Hammer, p. 297. Conein reported that the generals had never indicated that assassination was on their minds, since an orderly transition of power was a high priority in achieving their ultimate aim of gaining international recognition.Jones, pp. 416‚Äì17. Minh and Don asked Conein to secure an American aircraft to take the brothers out of the country. Two days earlier, Lodge had alerted Washington that such a request was likely and recommended Saigon as the departure point. This request put the Kennedy administration in a difficult position, as the provision of an airplane would publicly tie it to the coup. When Conein telephoned the Saigon CIA station, there was a ten-minute wait. The US government would not allow the aircraft to land in any country, unless that state was willing to grant asylum to Diem. The United States did not want Diem and Nhu to form a government in exile and Roger Hilsman had written earlier that \\"Under no circumstances should the Nhus be permitted to remain in Southeast Asia in close proximity to Vietnam because of the plots they will mount to try to regain power. If the generals decide to exile Diem, he should also be sent outside Southeast Asia.\\"Hammer, p. 294. He further went on to anticipate what he termed a \\"G√∂tterd√§mmerung in the palace\\".Hammer, p. 295. After surrendering, Di·ªám rang Lodge and spoke to the American envoy for the last time. Lodge did not report the conversation to Washington, so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup was just starting. However, after Lodge died in 1985, his aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Di·ªám spoke for the last at around 07:00 on 2 November, moments after Di·ªám surrendered. When Di·ªám called, Lodge \\"put [him] on hold\\" and then walked away. Upon his return, the ambassador offered Di·ªám and Nhu asylum, but would not arrange for transportation to the Philippines until the next day. This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Di·ªám to not resist the coup.Moyar, p. 271. Dunn then offered to personally go to the brothers' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him, but Lodge refused, saying \\"We just can't get that involved\\".Winters, p. 104. Dunn said \\"I was really astonished that we didn't do more for them\\".Moyar, p. 272. Having refused to help the Ng√¥ brothers to leave the country safely, Lodge later said after they had been shot: \\"What would we have done with them if they had lived? Every Colonel Blimp in the world would have made use of them.\\" Dunn claimed Lodge put Di·ªám on hold to inform Conein where the brothers werethey had sneaked out of the palace so that the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane would have to go directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup. Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in Guam, and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Di·ªám for that long. Conein reportedly did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a United States Senate investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative conundrum: \\"One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day.\\" =Escape to Cholon= Minh traveled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan with his aide and bodyguard, Captain Nhung to arrest the Ng√¥ brothers. Minh had also dispatched an APC and four jeeps to Gia Long to transport Di·ªám and Nhu back to JGS headquarters for the ceremonial handover of power during a nationally televised event witnessed by international media. Di·ªám and Nhu would then \\"ask\\" the generals to be granted exile and asylum in a foreign country, which would be granted. =Di·ªám's escape= alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black- haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie. Minh instead arrived to find that the brothers were missing. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 the night before, Di·ªám and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Cao Xu√¢n Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth, and RVNAF Lieutenant ƒê·ªó Th∆°, Di·ªám's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of ƒê·ªó M·∫≠u.Hammer, p. 293. Di·ªám and Nhu emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif (), the city's upper-class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting vehicle. Historian Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ng√¥ brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citro√´n sedan.Karnow, p. 323. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Di·ªám that the brothers split up, arguing this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Kh√°nh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt that the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother was to regain power. According to one account, Di·ªám reportedly turned down Nhu, reasoning that \\"You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you.\\" Another story holds that Di·ªám reportedly said \\"We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?\\" Nhu agreed to stay together until the end. The loyalists reached the home of Ma Tuyen in the Chinese business district of Cholon. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who was reported to be Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the opium trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the Republic of China, but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders. Nhu's secret agents had fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had any idea that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building, leading to futile deaths. Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Di·ªám and Nhu had escaped in the middle of the night. thumb After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ng√¥ family, Colonel Ph·∫°m Ng·ªçc Th·∫£o was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Th·∫£o was told by Khi√™m to find and prevent Di·ªám from being killed.Hammer, p. 292. When Th·∫£o arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Di·ªám and Nhu overheard him and fled to the nearby Catholic Church of St. Francis Xavier (). The Ng√¥ brothers walked through the shady courtyard. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant while they walked through the yard.Jones, p. 428. A few minutes later, just after 10:00, an APC and two jeeps entered.Jones, p. 429. =Execution= thumb The convoy was led by General Mai H·ªØu Xu√¢n and consisted of Colonels Quan and L·∫Øm. Quan was Minh's deputy, and L·∫Øm was commander of Di·ªám's Civil Guard. L·∫Øm had joined the coup once a rebel victory seemed assured. Two further officers made up the convoy: Major D∆∞∆°ng Hi·∫øu Nghƒ©a and Captain Nhung, Minh's bodyguard.Hammer, pp. 297‚Äì98. Nhu expressed disgust that they were to be transported in an APC, asking \\"You use such a vehicle to drive the president?\\" L·∫Øm assured them the armor was for their own protection. Xu√¢n told them it was selected to protect them from \\"extremists\\". The brothers' hands were tied behind their backs . After the arrest, Nhung and Nghƒ©a sat with the brothers in the APC, and the convoy departed for T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t. Before the convoy departed for the church, Minh reportedly gestured to Nhung with two fingers, which some have claimed was to be taken as an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were killed. An investigation by ƒê√¥n later determined that Nghia had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife.Karnow, p. 326. =Attempted cover-up= When the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters, the generals were shocked. Although they despised and had no sympathy for Nhu, they still respected Di·ªám, and several lost their composure. ƒê√≠nh later declared \\"I couldn't sleep that night\\", while ƒê√¥n maintained that the generals were \\"truly grievous\\", maintaining that they were sincere in their intentions to give a safe exile. ƒê√¥n charged Nhu with convincing Di·ªám to reject the offer. Lodge later concluded \\"Once again, brother Nhu proves to be the evil genius in Di·ªám's life.\\" ƒê√¥n ordered another general to tell reporters that the brothers had died in an accident. He went to confront Minh in his office. *ƒê√¥n: Why are they dead? *Minh: And what does it matter that they are dead? At this time, Xu√¢n walked into Minh's office through the open door, unaware of ƒê√¥n's presence. Xu√¢n snapped to attention and stated \\"Mission accomplie\\". Shortly after, the CIA sent word to the White House that Di·ªám and Nhu were dead, allegedly due to suicide. Vietnam Radio had announced their deaths by poison, and that they had committed suicide while in the APC. Unclear and contradictory stories abounded. General Harkins reported that the suicides had occurred either by gunshot or by a grenade wrestled from the belt of an ARVN officer who was standing guard. Minh tried to explain the discrepancy by saying \\"Due to an inadvertence, there was a gun inside the vehicle. It was with this gun that they committed suicide.\\"Jones, p. 425. Lucien Conein, the CIA's contact with the ARVN generals When Kennedy learned of the deaths during a White House meeting, he appeared shaken and left the room. Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was \\"particularly abhorrent\\" and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's X√° L·ª£i Pagoda raids.Moyar, p. 276. Kennedy's reaction did not draw unanimous sympathy.Jones, p. 427. The Americans became aware later of the true reasons for the deaths of Di·ªám and Nhu through Conein.Jones, p. 430. Later, photos appeared showing the two dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of the APC. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide.Jones, pp. 430‚Äì31. Once the news of the cause of death of the Ng√¥ brothers began to become public, the US became concerned at their association with the new junta and began asking questions. Lodge initially backed the false story disseminated by the generals, believing that they had shot themselves.Winters, p. 107. Lodge showed no alarm in public, congratulating ƒê√¥n on the \\"masterful performance\\" of the coup and promising diplomatic recognition. ƒê√¥n's assertion that the assassinations were unplanned were sufficient for Lodge, who told the State Department that \\"I am sure assassination was not at their direction.\\" Minh and ƒê√¥n reiterated their position in a meeting with Conein and Lodge on the following day. Several members of the Kennedy administration were appalled by the killings, citing them as a key factor in the future leadership troubles which beset South Vietnam. The assassinations caused a split within the leadership of the junta and repulsed American and world opinion. The killings damaged the public belief that the new regime would be an improvement over the Ng√¥ family, turning the initial harmony among the generals into discord. The criticism of the killings caused the officers to distrust and battle one another for positions in the new government. According to Jones, \\"when decisions regarding postcoup affairs took priority, resentment over the killings meshed with the visceral competition over government posts to disassemble the new regime before it fully took form.\\"Jones, p. 436. =Culpability debate= alt=Middle- aged black-haired man, stands side-on in a dark suit with a cigarette in right hand and left hand in pocket, looking at the large map of the Asia Pacific region on the wall. The responsibility for the assassinations was generally put on the shoulders of Minh. Conein asserted that \\"I have it on very good authority of very many people, that Big Minh gave the order,\\" as did William Colby, the director of the CIA's Far Eastern division. ƒê√¥n was equally emphatic, saying \\"I can state without equivocation that this was done by General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh and by him alone.\\"Jones, p. 435. Lodge thought Xu√¢n was partly culpable, asserting that \\"Di·ªám and Nhu had been assassinated, if not by Xu√¢n personally, at least at his direction.\\" Minh later blamed Thi·ªáu for the assassinations. In 1971, Minh claimed Thi·ªáu was responsible for the deaths by hesitating and delaying the attack by the 5th Division on Gia Long Palace.Hammer, p. 299. Thi·ªáu stridently denied responsibility and issued a statement that Minh did not dispute: \\"D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh has to assume entire responsibility for the death of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám.\\" During the presidency of Richard Nixon, a Kennedy opponent, a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement, convinced that Kennedy secretly ordered the killings, but no evidence was found.Hammer, p. 296. Conein asserted that Minh's humiliation by the Ng√¥ brothers was a major motivation for ordering their executions. He reasoned that Minh had been embarrassed by arriving at the presidential residence in full ceremonial military uniform to take power, only to find an empty building. One CIA employee said \\"They had to kill him [Di·ªám]. Otherwise his supporters would gradually rally and organise and there would be civil war.\\" Several months after the event, Minh reportedly said privately that \\"We had no alternative. They had to be killed. Di·ªám could not be allowed to live because he was too much respected among simple, gullible people in the countryside, especially the Catholics and the refugees. We had to kill Nhu because he was so widely feared - and he had created organizations that were arms of his personal power.\\" Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng, a civilian opposition politician who was jailed in 1960 for signing the Caravelle Manifesto that criticised Di·ªám, said: \\"The top generals who decided to murder Di·ªám and his brother were scared to death. The generals knew very well that having no talent, no moral virtues, no political support whatsoever, they could not prevent a spectacular comeback of the president and Mr. Nhu if they were alive.\\"Jones, pp. 435‚Äì36. Reaction The reaction to the coup was mixed. The coup was immediately denounced by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, asserting that the coup had brought a US \\"puppet\\" government. The remainder of the world expressed the general hope that the junta would end persecution against Buddhists and focus on defeating the communist insurgency. Both North Vietnam and the VC were caught off guard by the events in Saigon. Hanoi initially did not comment apart from repeating the news, as they had not been prepared. On one hand, the communist leaders were disheartened that they could no longer exploit Di·ªám's unpopularity. On the other hand, they were confident that Di·ªám's successors would be weak, fall apart easily and facilitate a communist revolution. The official newspaper, the Nhan Dan, opined that \\"By throwing off Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, the US imperialists have themselves destroyed the political bases they had built up for years. The deaths of Diem and Nhu were followed by the disintegration of big fragments of the ... [government] machine.\\" On the night of 1 November, as Gia Long Palace was besieged, VC radio in South Vietnam had urged the Vietnamese people and ARVN loyalists to resist the coup. However, the general's quick and successful coup prevented any joint action. Within a week of the coup, the VC had regained its direction and launched more than one thousand attacks. A communist spokesperson expressed shock that the Americans had appeared to support the removal of Di·ªám, believing him to have been one of their strongest opponents. The leader of the VC, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªç termed the coup a \\"gift from Heaven for us\\".Jones, pp. 419‚Äì20. Some VC officials were so surprised that the Americans would remove Di·ªám that they thought it was a trick. They felt Di·ªám's removal was a blunder on the part of the Americans. Tho said \\"Our enemy has been seriously weakened from all points of view, military, political and administrative.\\"Hammer, p. 309. Th·ªç said: The deposition of the Ng√¥ brothers was greeted with widespread joy by the South Vietnamese public. Large spontaneous street demonstrations took place. The offices of the Times of Vietnam, the Ng√¥ family's propaganda mouthpiece, were burned. Elsewhere, the crowd smashed windows and ransacked any building associated with Nhu. The tension released by the downfall of the regime sparked off celebrations similar to T·∫øt (Lunar New Year) celebrations. Americans were treated and received with great enthusiasm and Lodge was mobbed by the Saigon public and it was joked that Lodge would win any Vietnamese election by a landslide. Lodge recommended immediate recognition of the new regime by Washington, asserting that the popular approval of the Vietnamese for the coup warranted it. Lodge reported: \\"Every Vietnamese has a grin on his face today\\". The crowds swarmed onto the grounds of Gia Long Palace in a carnival atmosphere, punctuated by celebratory ARVN gunfire, while a sea of Buddhist flags flew throughout the city. As Lodge traveled from his residence to the US embassy, the crowds cheered his convoy, and when he walked past the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda, the focal point of the raids by Nhu's Special Forces, he was mobbed by jubilant Buddhists. The people were very happy with the soldiers, giving them fruit, flowers and garlands of roses.Jones, pp. 423‚Äì24. Madame Nhu, who was in the United States at the time, denounced the coup and angrily accused the Americans of orchestrating it. When asked about whether the US was involved, she replied \\"definitely\\", elaborating that \\"no coup can erupt without American incitement and backing\\" and declaring that she would not seek asylum \\"in a country whose government stabbed me in the back\\". She said \\"I believe all the devils of hell are against us\\" and that \\"whoever has the Americans as allies does not need enemies\\".Jones, pp. 422‚Äì23. The United States publicly disclaimed responsibility or involvement in the coup. Many, including Harriman, General Maxwell Taylor, and Assistant Secretary of State Roger Hilsman, denied involvement, although Hilsman admitted that American disapproval of Diem's policies would have encouraged the generals. Privately, the White House was elated by the coup, as it had been relatively bloodless.Jones, p. 421. The White House fostered the impression that the coup was purely Vietnamese and claimed to have no knowledge of it. A year later, Trueheart was quoted that the United States had been aware of the generals' actions.Jones, p. 422. =Transition of power= Even before the start of the coup, the generals had been in contact with civilian opposition figures and more moderate members of Di·ªám's regime. Once the coup was confirmed to be finished, negotiations by the generals and dissidents began. All of Di·ªám's ministers were forced to resign, and no further reprisals were taken. Di·ªám's Vice President Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆° had discussions with Minh over the interim government. The Americans also pressured the generals to give Th∆° a prominent role so as to give the impression of civilian rule. They promised to resume the Commercial Import Program, their main aid initiative to South Vietnam, which had been suspended due to relations with Di·ªám. The Military Revolutionary Council as it called itself, dissolved Di·ªám's rubber stamp National Assembly and the constitution of 1956. They vowed support for free elections, unhindered political opposition, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and an end to discrimination, and that the purpose of the coup was to bolster the fight against the VC. They condemned the recent legislative elections as \\"dishonest and fraudulent\\", imposed martial law, announced a curfew and ordered the release of political prisoners jailed by Di·ªám. The MRC announced that a new constitution would be written. In the interim, an appointed body known as the \\"Council of Notables\\" replaced the legislature in an advisory capacity.Jones, p. 424. The generals decided on a two-tier government structure with a military committee overseen by Minh presiding over a regular cabinet that would be predominantly civilian with Th∆° as Prime Minister. The new government was announced on 5 November. Minh was named President and Chief of the Military Committee; Th∆° was listed as Prime Minister, Minister of Economy, and Minister of Finance; ƒê√¥n was named Minister of Defense; and ƒê√≠nh was made the Minister of Security (Interior). Only one other general was in the cabinet of 15, which was dominated by bureaucrats and civilians with no previous political experience. This was followed by the release of Provisional Constitutional Act No. 1, formally suspending the 1956 constitution and detailing the structure and duty of the interim government. On 6 November, Saigon radio announced the composition of the Executive Committee of the Military Revolutionary Council. Minh was Chairman, ƒê√≠nh and ƒê√¥n were Deputy Chairmen, and nine other senior generals, including Kim, Thi·ªáu, Khi√™m, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Minh and Ph·∫°m Xu√¢n Chi·ªÉu. A notable omission was the II Corps commander, General Kh√°nh, who was transferred to I Corps, the northernmost Corps and the farthest away from Saigon. The Americans recognized the new government on 8 November.

It features mascots of various open-source projects. SuperTuxKart is cross-platform, running on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android systems. Version 1.0 was officially released on April 20, 2019. SuperTuxKart started as a fork of TuxKart, originally developed by Steve and Oliver Baker in 2000. When TuxKart's development ended around March 2004, a fork as SuperTuxKart was conducted by other developers in 2006. SuperTuxKart is under active development by the game's community.  Gameplay  GNU and Nolok in the beginning story of Story Mode in STK Split-screen 4-player multiplayer in SuperTuxKart (2017, 0.9.3) SuperTuxKart gameplay is similar to that of the Mario Kart series, but also has distinct elements, such as collecting and using cans of Nitro. The game features the mascots of several open source projects. For example, Mozilla Thunderbird plays the referee, flagging the start of the race and saving players when they drive off the course. The game supports single player, local multiplayer, WAN multiplayer, and LAN multiplayer modes. Networking modes were introduced in version 1.0. = Characters = Similarly to Warmux, the official characters are the mascots of free and open-source projects, for instance Thunderbird (Referee) (for Mozilla Thunderbird), Tux (Linux kernel), Adiumy (Adium), Beastie (BSD), Emule (eMule), Hexley (Darwin), Pidgin (Pidgin), Suzanne (Blender), Wilber (GIMP), Gnu (GNU), Konqi (KDE), Puffy (OpenBSD), Xue (Xfce), Sara (OpenGameArt.org), Amanda (Window Maker), Kiki (Krita), and Gavroche (Media Goblin). An exception is Nolok, who does not represent a particular open source project, but was created by the SuperTux project as the antagonist of Tux. The mascots for many other projects are available as add-ons from SuperTuxKart's add-ons website, including Geeko (for openSUSE), Blinky (FreeDOS), Minix (Minix 3), Chinchila (Big Buck Bunny), Gooey (WebGUI), Kitty (AROS), Python (Python), Choqok (ChoqoK), Penny and Mr. Iceblock (SuperTux), Amiga (Amiga OS), Android (Android), Audacity Girl (Audacity), Proog (Blender Foundation), Transmission (Transmission), Beagle (Beagle Desktop Search), ElePHPant (PHP), Mozilla (formerly) (Mozilla), and Buggie (Bugzilla). = Plot = Unlike Mario Kart, STK has a story associated with gameplay, similar to Crash Team Racing. Story mode is used to unlock tracks and characters for single and multi-player modes. At the beginning of story mode, Gnu, the leader of the free/libre and open-source world, is captured by Nolok, the villain in STK, with his spaceship. Nolok then visits Tux and tells him that he has kidnapped Gnu; unless Tux and his friends can defeat Nolok, the 'King of the Karts', Gnu would become his supper. After the player defeats Nolok in Fort Magma, the final track of STK, Tux rescues Gnu from his prison.  History  Screenshot showing character selection screen (2018). TuxKart - Tux Tollway, from version 0.4 SuperTuxKart 0.7, the first version to use the Irrlicht Engine SuperTuxKart is based on TuxKart, a project initiated by Steve Baker in April 2000. Due to TuxKart project internal disagreements the development stalled and collapsed ultimately, and the project was abandoned in March 2004. The project was forked as SuperTuxKart, but remained in an unplayable and unmaintained state. In 2006 Joerg \\"Hiker\\" Henrichs resurrected the project and, with the help of Eduardo \\"Coz\\" Hernandez Munoz, released the game in a playable state. In 2008, Marianne Gagnon (aka. \\"Auria\\") joined the project and eventually replaced Coz as one of the project leaders after his retirement. Historically licensed under version 2 of the GPL, in 2008 the game's source code was relicensed to the GPLv3. The game's assets (textures, models, sounds, music, etc.) are licensed under a mixture of free content and DFSG conforming licenses: GPL, CC BY, CC BY-SA, and Public Domain. In 2010, SuperTuxKart switched away from using SDL and PLIB libraries (used through version 0.6.2) for graphics and started using the Irrlicht Engine. This change was released in version 0.7. In 2013 and 2014, the game participated in Google Summer of Code as a mentoring organization. The migration of the code repository from Sourceforge to GitHub was officially announced on 17 January 2014, though the assets repository and downloads remain on Sourceforge. On April 21, 2015, version 0.9 was released which used a highly modified version of Irrlicht, including an entirely new graphics renderer dubbed Antarctica. This enabled much better graphics with features such as dynamic lighting, ambient occlusion, depth of field, real-time shadow mapping, and more. In early 2018, Antarctica switched to using PBR in the git version of the game. Antarctica Rendering Engine uses OpenGL 3.3+ (or OpenGL ES on suitable platforms) and GLSL for most of the graphical work. In March 2017, SuperTuxKart was greenlit on digital distributor Steam.. However, as of May 2020, SuperTuxKart is not available on Steam. In May 2019, Joerg \\"Hiker\\" Henrichs stepped down as a lead developer of SuperTuxkart, with \\"Benau\\" and \\"Alayan\\" taking over as the new project leaders.  Reception  In 2004, TuxKart was selected by The Linux Game Tome to be their \\"Game of the Month\\" project. In 2007 Full Circle Magazine named SuperTuxKart as one of the top five racing games available for Linux, describing it as the game to try if you're \\"tired of realistic driving\\". Linux Journal also praised the game, saying that \\"the courses in SuperTuxKart are fun, colorful and imaginative\\" and that \\"If you've played the original, you'll be impressed by the new, hugely improved, SuperTuxKart.\\" Although it did not make it into the APC Mag top five free games, it received an honorable mention in 2008. In 2009, TechRadar cited it as one of the best games to put on a Linux netbook. In 2016, OMG! Ubuntu! called SuperTuxKart \\"[T]he best kart racing game to not feature Mario, Toad or Diddy Kong\\". Since August 2007 SuperTuxKart has been downloaded over 3.2 million times from Sourceforge.net and has over 100 thousand downloads on the Google Play store.

He made his first appearance on 29 October 2007. He is the youngest child of Jim (John Bardon) and Reenie Branning (Joy Graham) and the brother of April Branning (Debbie Arnold), Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), Suzy Branning (Maggie O'Neill) and Max Branning (Jake Wood). The character was introduced to the show during a period when EastEnders was being routinely criticised in the media for its reliance on resurrecting old characters. The casting of Scott Maslen provoked some controversy, being the first time an actor had been poached from one mainstream soap to another. It was quickly established that Jack is a morally ambiguous character, with a murky past in the police force resulting in the paralysis of his young daughter. Tabloid media have praised the character for his role as resident Romeo, commenting frequently on his good looks and attractiveness, although broadsheet press have been more critical of Maslen's acting. On 1 July 2019, Maslen filmed his 1000th episode as Jack. Maslen took a two-month break from the role in October 2010 to participate in the 2010 series of Strictly Come Dancing, returning in December 2010. Maslen made an indefinite departure from the role on 15 October 2013 after six years on the show.'EastEnders': Jack Branning leaves Walford - spoiler pictures - EastEnders News - Soaps - Digital Spy Having turned down a chance to return to the role in April 2015, Jack made a previously unannounced return on 24 December 2015,'Merry Christmas, Ronnie!' EastEnders brings back Jack Branning in a shock storyline twistScott Maslen confirms Jack Branning's EastEnders return is permanent before leaving once again on 1 January 2016. Maslen returned to filming during the same month and Jack returned on-screen on 1 March 2016. Since returning, his storylines have included reuniting with Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), gaining custody of his son Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles), finding out Ronnie has drowned on their wedding day and his subsequent grief over her death, a custody battle with Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett) over his stepson Matthew Mitchell Cotton, supporting his great-niece Tiffany Butcher (Maisie Smith) over her rape and confronting her attacker, as well as rejoining the police force. Storylines =Backstory= Jack is the youngest child of Jim (John Bardon) and Reenie Branning (Joy Graham) and brother of Derek (Terence Beesley; Jamie Foreman), Carol (Lindsey Coulson), April (Debbie Arnold), Suzy (Julie Christian-Young; Maggie O'Neill) and Max (Jake Wood). Having grown up in a large family in a poor area of East London, Jack regularly fought his older brother, Max, for the attentions of his father who was an alcoholic. He was very close friends with Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), another local East End boy and went to school with him and had a closer relationship with him than he did with his brothers. As a teenager, Jack stole his grandfather's World War II medal, knowing that it was Jim's prized possession as his father had died in combat when he was only six years old, and framed Max, causing a huge rift between Jim and Max and resulting in Max walking out in 1989. Despite Max and Jack being arch-rivals, they kept in touch as Jack was present at Max's wedding to Tanya Cross (Jo Joyner) in 1994 and watched his nieces Lauren (Madeline Duggan; Jacqueline Jossa) and Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald) grow up. Jack settled down with Selina (Daisy Beaumont) and on marrying, they had a daughter, Penny (Mia Mckenna-Bruce). Jack built a career in the police force, but got involved in criminal activities and when they backfired, one of Jack's informants knocked Selina and Penny down in revenge for being accidentally sent down. Penny's spinal cord was severed, putting her in a wheelchair and, in the aftermath, Jack and Selina divorced and he retired from the police force. =2007‚Äì2013= Jack comes to Walford for his nephew Bradley Branning's (Charlie Clements) wedding to Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner). Upon his arrival, Jack soaks Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) when driving through a puddle, so she soaks him with her water bottle. A fight with Max leads to Jack's wedding invitation being revoked, so he stays at The Queen Victoria public house and helps Ronnie's sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) prepare for the reception. Deciding to stay, Jack comes between Ronnie and Roxy when he buys Scarlet Nightclub and offers Ronnie a partnership. Jack causes more disruption in the Mitchell family when he sets up Ronnie's cousin, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), by taping him confessing to his part in Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels) death. Jack blackmails Phil with this, demanding the car lot for his silence, which he then rents to Pat Evans (Pam St Clement). Despite the Mitchells' animosity, Jack develops an attraction to Ronnie and a relationship starts. The other Mitchells, particularly Roxy, try to end the relationship. Jack's ex-wife, Selina, reappears briefly and they have sex, which Roxy discovers and tells Ronnie, who is due to live with Jack. Ronnie ends the relationship. They reconcile, but Ronnie does not trust Jack and struggles to bond with his daughter, Penny. Jack and Roxy have sex while drunk. They agree to conceal this, but Roxy is pregnant and later gives birth to Jack's daughter Amy Mitchell (Amelie Conway). Jack romances Tanya, who is now separated from Max. Jack supports Tanya and her children as they strive to cope after discovering Max's affair with Stacey and his departure. When Max returns, he is furious to discover they are together. Max attempts to buy the family home but Jack outbids him, buying No. 5 Albert Square and sharing the residence with Tanya and the children. Max tries to break them up but is unsuccessful. Max frames Jack, claiming Jack tried to kill him. Jack is arrested but soon released, due to his connections in the police force. In revenge, Jack takes Max hostage, beating and taunting him before abandoning him in an old warehouse. That night, Max is hit by a car and Jack is the main suspect. Max's daughter, Lauren, later confesses to her family, but Tanya tells the police she did it and is arrested. Tanya is forced to split from Jack. Jack demands a DNA test on Amy, Roxy's daughter. Reluctantly agreeing, Roxy assures him that her husband Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) is Amy's father. Jack concentrates on re-building his relationship with Ronnie, with whom he now shares a flat. However, Jack's sister,, Suzy reveals the true result, that Jack is Amy's father. Furious, Sean snatches Amy and persuades Roxy to join him on a trip but Sean tries to kill them by driving into a frozen lake. Jack and Ronnie save Roxy and Amy. Roxy tells Jack that he will have no contact with Amy and Ronnie refuses to reconcile with him. Jack tries establishing regular contact with Amy, leading Ronnie to leave Walford. Racing to the airport to stop her, Jack tells Ronnie that he loves her over the airport tannoy. They return to Walford together and Roxy agrees not to interfere. Ronnie and Jack discuss the possibility of a baby but he refuses, telling her she needs to grieve for her deceased daughter, Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace). Jack asks Ronnie to marry him but catches her piercing condoms. They argue and Jack leaves, but finds Ronnie's ring on the table when he returns. After telling Jack that Ronnie has left Walford, Roxy tries seducing Jack but he pushes her away. When Ronnie returns, Jack begs her to reunite with him, but she refuses. A few weeks later, she asks him to buy her out of the nightclub and to fund this, Jack sells the car lot to Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb), Ronnie and Roxy's father who Ronnie despises. This distances Ronnie further from Jack. The feud between Jack and Phil recommences. Phil discovers that Jack is dealing drugs and when Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) buys drugs from one of his contacts, Phil forces Jack to buy them back. Humiliated, Jack employs Phil's sister Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook), infuriating Phil. Despite knowing she is engaged to Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), Jack and Sam begin an affair. Archie intervenes and pays Jack to keep seeing Sam, part of his plan to take over The Queen Vic. He also tells Jack's niece and Ricky's ex-wife Bianca (Patsy Palmer) about the affair. Later, Bianca drags Sam into The Queen Vic by her hair and forces her to tell Ricky in front of Jack about the affair she was having. Jack is distraught as Roxy was about to give him Ronnie's address but when the affair is revealed, Roxy changes her mind and throws him out of the pub. Ronnie gets pregnant but she has a miscarriage when Archie pushes her against the bar in the pub during an argument. Jack comforts Ronnie and takes in Ronnie, Roxy and Amy when they are made homeless by Archie. Jack confronts Archie on Christmas Day 2009 and threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie is murdered that day and an investigation begins. Four weeks later, Jack asks Ronnie to dinner, to which she agrees but not until after Archie's funeral. At the funeral, Jack offers DC Wayne Hughes (Jamie Treacher) to help with any \\"local information\\" he might need. He later sees Ronnie tearing up the flowers on Archie's grave and asks her why and she thinks he is accusing her of murder. She later sees him talking to DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton), who is investigating the murder. Ronnie asks Jack how he would feel if he knew she had killed Archie, leading him to suspect her and also tells him, despite Jack's desire, that starting a relationship with him again is not what she wants. At his great- niece Tiffany Butcher's (Maisie Smith) birthday party, he cuts his hand and Tiffany tells him that she saw Bradley washing blood off his hands on Christmas Day. Jack confronts Bradley who eventually reveals that he found out from Stacey on Christmas Day that Archie had raped and impregnated her, and Bradley punched Archie. Jack urges Bradley to go to the police, saying if he does not, Jack will. However, Max stops him and when DNA screening starts and Bradley gives a sample, Jack bribes Hughes to make the DNA samples disappear. Janine is arrested when someone plants Archie's mother's missing engagement ring in her flat and Jack hears from Hughes when she is being released. Jack offers Janine money to leave Walford and they accuse each other. He says he did not set her up and Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) stops him from hurting Janine. Later, Jack receives another call from Hughes to say that someone has reported Bradley and he is about to be arrested. Jack tells Bradley he must leave Walford quickly, and says he will meet them soon and help them to go. However, Jack is delayed by police and when Bradley realises he has left his passport behind, he returns to the Square where police see him and chase him to the roof of The Queen Vic, where he stumbles and falls to his death. A distraught Stacey tells Max she killed Archie and disappears afterwards, but Jack does not find out about this and tells Max at Bradley's funeral that the court has found Bradley posthumously guilty. Jack begins a relationship with Chelsea Fox (Tiana Benjamin) after helping her escape from a blind date. He organises a party his niece Lauren at R&R;, where Kylie (Elarica Gallacher) attempts to shoot Jack's nephew Billie (Devon Anderson) but Jack is shot instead as he pushes Billie out of the way. Jack is taken to hospital, where doctors tell his family he may be left with severe brain damage. He is put in a medically induced coma and undergoes an operation due to swelling on his brain, which is successful. When he is brought out of the coma, it is discovered that he is paralysed down the left side of his body but it is not clear whether it is periodic or permanent. Jack then breaks up with Chelsea and attempts to phone Ronnie, but she does not hear her phone ringing as she is spending time with Jack's consultant, Mr. Steele (Simon Wilson). He starts to feel helpless and wants to give up, but after Max refuses to help him, he puts his phone out of reach and manages to pull himself up with one arm. Meanwhile, Chelsea suspects she might be pregnant with Jack's child, and wants to keep the baby but is unsure about telling Jack. However, when she takes another test, she finds out she is not pregnant and Jack never finds out about this. Max reveals to Jack that he saw Ronnie and Mr. Steele kissing, so Jack punches Mr. Steele out of jealousy. When Ronnie discovers this, she dumps Mr. Steele and rushes to see Jack, telling him that if he were to propose, she would not turn him down. Billie visits Jack to apologise, but Jack ignores his apology as it has taken him weeks to visit him, calling him cowardly. Billie leaves in tears and then joins the army to make Jack proud of him. Ronnie visits again and is told that Jack was able to move his toe earlier. She thinks Jack needs better care so decides to find him a place at a private clinic. Jack later hears from Max that there has been a fire at the club, and Ronnie tells him he is going to the clinic. However, she decides not to claim on the insurance to keep Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) out of trouble. Roxy hears from Max that Ronnie has no money and is not claiming, so she decides to pay for Jack's treatment and he is moved to the private clinic. Jack makes decent progress and when Ronnie visits him, they end up having sex. A few days later, having been discharged from hospital, Jack turns up in The Queen Victoria for Ronnie's birthday. Later, when they return to his flat, Jack asks Ronnie to marry him and she accepts. When he finds out that Archie raped Ronnie when she was 13 years old, he finds it hard to believe at first because she would have known about it for several years without telling anybody, however, he tells Ronnie he does believe her and vows to not let anyone hurt her again. He becomes frustrated when his progress at physiotherapy slows down. He is determined to walk at his own wedding but Max says he never will, and makes him angry, goading him into getting out of his wheelchair. Ronnie discovers that Sam is pregnant and tells Jack, asking if it could be his even though Sam insists it is Ricky's. After the baby is born, Sam admits she is unsure. Jack and Ronnie visit Sam and the baby in hospital. Even though Sam now says that baby, Richard, is Ricky's, Bianca tells Jack he should see if Richard is his. He and Ronnie both agree and tell Sam, and Ricky also agrees to a paternity test. Ronnie tells Jack whatever the result is, they will be okay. Sam reveals that the paternity test confirmed Ricky as the father. Ronnie and Jack are relieved and Ronnie reveals that she is pregnant with Jack's baby. However, a suspicious Bianca gets the paternity results for herself, and reveals that the father is actually Jack. Sam then tells them that Ronnie made her lie. Ronnie tells Jack she did not want to share him with anyone else, and Jack understands. Later, Sam visits Jack and Ronnie saying she cannot cope with the baby on her own, and asks them to have him. Ronnie and Jack agree but when they are due to meet, Sam does not turn up. Ronnie visits Sam and tells her to keep Richard but offers her money to leave Walford as when Jack finds out he will come looking for her. Ronnie returns to Jack but finds Sam has already dropped Richard off. Ronnie then meets Sam with cash and tells her to take Richard back but she will have to leave straight away. Sam leaves the next day. Before Billie's birthday, he visits Jack but Jack tells him to leave, however, he goes to Billie's party. Billie and Kylie's friend Connor Stanley (Arinze Kene) turns up and apologises to Jack on behalf of Kylie. Kylie is sentenced to 15 years in prison. The day before Jack and Ronnie's wedding, Jack helps Max take revenge on Harry Gold (Linal Haft) who is harassing his ex-wife Vanessa (Z√∂e Lucker), Max's girlfriend. They threaten Harry and tell him to stay away, but afterwards Jack is grabbed by two men and bundled into a car. The next day, nobody is able to find Jack but Max finds his phone. He drives Ronnie to the wedding and finds Jack in the boot of the wedding car, tied up and gagged. Max frees him and Jack and Ronnie get married. After, they leave for their honeymoon. After the honeymoon, Jack goes abroad on business and is unable to return to see Ronnie give birth to their son James. Before Jack returns, James dies due to cot death but Ronnie swaps their deceased baby with Alfie (Shane Richie) and Kat Moon's (Jessie Wallace) newborn baby, Tommy. Jack is introduced to Tommy as his own son, and bonds with him. However, he worries about Ronnie's state of mind when she struggles to cope. Jack sells his share in R&R; and goes into business with Max at the car lot, renaming it Branning Brothers. He then meets Michael, Alfie's cousin who he knows from his youth, and invites him to stay but Ronnie finds out Michael is Tommy's real father and tells Jack to kick him out, which Jack eventually does. When Jack announces he and Michael are opening a boxing club, Ronnie is infuriated, so she lies that Michael came onto her. Jack punches Michael but Michael tells him that Ronnie is obsessed with him and has stolen a passport photo of him, which Jack later finds with Ronnie's things. He confronts her, but says is she does not know why she took it, but insists she does not want Michael near the baby. He quits the car lot to look after the boxing club full-time. He starts to worry about Ronnie's erratic behaviour. Eventually, she tells Jack that he is not the father, and hands Tommy back to Kat and Alfie. Tommy is taken into care and Jack says an emotional goodbye, while Ronnie is in police custody. Jack visits her in prison, but she tells him to forget he ever met her and find someone else. Jack goes into deep depression and begins drinking heavily. He meets Tanya's sister, Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks), in the club and they have a one-night stand; however, Jack throws Rainie out the following morning. Max tries to help him along with Carol but he brutally beats Max, however, they reconcile on Max's birthday. Jack discovers Ronnie has been released on bail, and decides to forgive her, asking her to move back in. On the day of Ronnie's hearing, Jack attempts to flee the country with her to Mexico. Michael frames her by taking Roxy's mobile and asking her to meet at the park. She finds Tommy alone and crying, and attempts to help him. Kat and Alfie then see Ronnie holding Tommy with disbelief, and after slapping her and getting Tommy back off her, Kat says that she will be laughing as Ronnie rots in jail. Later, Roxy finds out Michael did, in fact, frame Ronnie and he later admits this to her and Kat. At the hearing, Ronnie is sentenced to 3 years in prison but Kat changes her mind and decides she does not want her to go to prison. Kat then runs over to Ronnie and says she forgives her, and that she agrees that they are the same. The two hold their hands to each other separated by the glass. Ronnie is then taken away, leaving Jack devastated. Jack continually tries to visit Ronnie in prison, but she refuses to see him. Michael taunts Jack by claiming he slept with Ronnie, and Jack beats him up in the toilets of The Queen Victoria. The fight is secretly witnessed by Michael's father Eddie Moon (David Essex) but he walks away as he thinks Michael set his stock on fire. Though Jack and Michael repair their friendship, Jack is dismayed when Michael organises an unlicensed boxing fight between his brother Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) and a seemingly unbeatable and violent opponent, all as part of Michael's revenge on his father. Though Tyler wins the fight, he is hospitalised, and the friendship between Jack and Michael is strained further. Roxy goes on a night out with friends, leaving Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) babysitting Amy. When he leaves Amy alone for a while to get a DVD from Jack's flat, Amy runs herself a bath, gets in and almost drowns. When Ben discovers her, Dr. Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) is called and he revives her. When Jack arrives, he accompanies Amy to the hospital who is still in a critical condition. The next day, Roxy arrives, and Jack accuses her of being neglectful. Jack then tells a social worker about Roxy's past and her family. After interviewing Roxy, the social worker awards temporary custody of Amy to Jack. He refuses to give Roxy access to Amy other than at pre-arranged times, and is annoyed when Abi allows Roxy to see Amy. When Abi tells Jack how her family is falling apart, Jack vows to bring Max back to Walford, as he left following the revelation of his affair with Tanya when she was married to Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth). Max returns to Walford with their brother, Derek. Jack is pleased to see Derek, but is concerned when it is revealed that Tanya has cervical cancer. The court decides to award custody of Amy to Jack, however Roxy vows to appeal the decision. When Phil receives a text message saying \\"I know you killed Kevin\\", Phil believes Jack is behind the message, so confronts him. Jack denies this, and when he goes to give Phil the recording, he finds it missing, along with a file on all of Phil's past misdemeanors. Phil continues to suspect Jack however, and has Jack's car crushed as a warning. In revenge, Jack prevents Roxy from seeing Amy. Roxy then tells Jack that Ronnie is filing for a divorce from him. On Christmas Day 2011, Jack sees Roxy taunting him into letting her see Amy after showing the toy she was going to give her, so he relents, knowing that he may not be able spend another Christmas with Ronnie. Amy starts pinching and scratching other children at nursery, and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) tells Roxy and Jack about this. They later talk and agree to not argue in front of Amy. Roxy realises it is the first time they have spoken properly since Amy was born, and they start to compliment each other as parents, which leads to sex. They continue with the custody battle, and Roxy soon discovers that Jack forged her signature to get Amy a passport. Roxy threatens to report this, and Jack drops the case so Roxy gains custody of Amy. Derek then continues to urge Jack to use dirty tactics to get Amy back, but makes things worse by telling Jack lies. Eventually, Derek pays a friend to have Roxy killed, but this does not happen and Jack confronts Derek saying that anything that happens to Roxy also happens to Amy. When Jack apologises to Roxy, she punches him and says that he is an unfit parent, saying that Penny is proof of this. Jack agrees and tells Max that he will not allow what happened to Penny happen to Amy. Denise Fox (Diane Parish) poaches the builder that Jack has hired. Jack argues with Denise, leading to her barring him from the Minute Mart. He later accidentally soaks her with water when washing his car.

However, their relationship starts to shake when Sharon agrees to a plan in order to gain custody of Lola Pearce's (Danielle Harold) baby, pretending to be Phil's fianc√©e, which makes Jack jealous; however, the lie becomes too much for Phil, so Sharon stops playing the part. Jack and the rest of his family fall out with Derek, and when he suffers a heart attack on Christmas Day, he, along with Max, Kat and Derek's son Joey (David Witts), do nothing to help him as he suffers. Jack tries to pull the group together in hiding this from the police. Phil jaunts the fact that he is still in love with Sharon to Jack on New Year's Eve, prompting a paranoid Jack to propose to her in an argument. However, on the same night, Phil proposes also, but Sharon says yes to Jack. However, he is still unnerved by Phil and sees him an opponent for his lover. When Sharon's son, Dennis Rickman Jr (Harry Hickles) starts a fight at school, Jack admits he taught Denny to box, angering Sharon. Jack receives a letter from Ronnie saying she is due to be released from prison.

She then moves back in with him, angering Phil, who forces her to choose between Jack and her family. She chooses Jack, and Jack buys an engagement ring, but when she tells him she does not want another baby, fearing going through the pain of losing James again, he breaks up with her. Jack soon realises that he will never be able to get over his past with Ronnie as long as he stays in Walford, so he leaves for France to reconnect with his daughter Penny. Ronnie shares a tender goodbye with him before watching him leave Walford in his car. =2015‚Äì= Jack returns to visit Dot and Amy for Christmas in December 2015. Ronnie is initially annoyed but later kisses him. He then finds out she tried to have Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) killed but admits he has missed her and they reignite their relationship.

Jack removes Amy from Roxy's care and warns Roxy that Dean is controlling her. She later realises that he is right, so ends her relationship with Dean. Jack is furious that Ronnie did not tell him about Dean's history, but reconciles with her while helping Billy propose to his former wife Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton), and Jack decides to stay in Walford for Ronnie. When Roxy arrives at Ronnie's house desperate for her help after Dean attempts to rape her, Jack, unaware of Roxy's ordeal, persuades Ronnie not to answer the door. Roxy leaves without Amy when she returns from the police station. Before leaving, she has a conversation with Ronnie, leading to Ronnie telling Jack that she needs a break and they cannot love each other again as she is broken and he leaves with Amy, promising her they will return to Walford soon. Jack returns when Honey calls him, but when Ronnie sees him, she runs away. As Jack leaves, Ronnie gets in his taxi and they kiss. Ronnie and Jack admit their feelings for each other, but when Ronnie is unable to commit, Jack decides to leave again and is collected by Delphine Rousseau (Emmanuelle Bouaziz). After seeing something on social media, Ronnie believes that Jack and Delphine are getting married and rushes to the venue to stop it. When Ronnie enters the hall, Jack is a guest at Delphine's wedding. Ronnie and Jack then have passionate sex in the shower. Later, Delphine tells Ronnie not to break Jack's heart, so Ronnie leaves. However, Jack goes to Walford and tells Ronnie he wants to spend his life with her and they kiss. Jack returns to France but comes back when he buys Max's old house, intending to convert it into apartments. Jack then discovers that Ronnie killed Carl White (Daniel Coonan) and is angry until she explains it was in self-defence. Jack and Ronnie are later confused when undertaker Les Coker (Roger Sloman) reveals that he has received an email informing him that Ronnie has died, which unnerves Jack but does not worry Ronnie. Jack believes that Hannah Reynolds (Mia Jenkins) is responsible, and she is arrested. Jack becomes good friends with one of his builders Andy Flynn (Jack Derges) and when he discovers that he has nowhere to live, Jack and Ronnie allow him to move in with them. However, it is later revealed that Andy is responsible for the email and is stalking Ronnie in revenge for Danielle, his adoptive sister. This is later revealed and Jack punches Andy, and after apologising to Ronnie and revealing that he grew to like her, Andy leaves Walford. When Roxy begins dealing drugs, Jack refuses to let her near Amy. Jack finally agrees for Roxy to see Amy, however, Amy goes missing the same time that Roxy's drugs are missing. It is assumed that Amy has taken the drugs but in hospital Amy reveals that she has not. Jack decides to file for full custody of Amy, devastating Roxy. When Sam returns to Walford with their son Ricky (now played by Henri Charles), Jack refuses to have anything to do with him. However, at Peggy Mitchell's (Barbara Windsor) funeral, Jack decides to see Ricky and they bond. Deciding that he is better off without her, Sam abandons Ricky at Jack's house and goes back to Portugal. Jack and Ricky struggle to get along, with Jack trying to put an end to Ricky's bad habits of constantly playing games and eating sweets, but their relationship soon improves. Jack and Ricky then join the local scouts club together. After a child dies after being stabbed near Amy and Ricky's school, Jack decides that he and Ronnie should move away with the children to Essex. This upsets Roxy as Amy would be moving with them. Ronnie agrees to the move but tells Jack they cannot move without Roxy's consent. Roxy is disgusted when she hears of Jack's plan to sell the house she owns with Ronnie, but Jack promises that she will get half of the money they get. Roxy then agrees to let Ronnie and Jack move. However, when Roxy is reminded of Jack's old philandering ways, she becomes suspicious of him and Honey. She informs Ronnie, who confronts Jack. Furious, Jack declares that he and Ronnie cannot have a new life with Roxy being a part of it. Realising that Ronnie and Jack can give Amy the life she deserves, Roxy says that Ronnie and Jack can move to Ongar alone. Jack is surprised when Max returns to Walford. He questions his motives and tells him to stay away from his wedding but later makes peace with Max and allows him to attend. Jack and Ronnie visit James's grave and proceed to the wedding venue. Ronnie runs out and Jack is furious to find out that Ronnie has allowed Roxy to move to Ongar with them. However, realising Ronnie needs her sister, he accepts this. Jack and Ronnie marry. At the end of the night, Amy and Ricky ask him to read them a story, and while he is doing so, a drunk Ronnie and Roxy drown in the hotel swimming pool after Ronnie attempts to rescue Roxy but is weighed down by her wedding dress. The next day, Jack is informed of the deaths and is heartbroken. He insists he does not want the children to know, but Max tries to convince him that he should tell them. Jack's police liaison officer tells Jack that CCTV shows Ronnie going into the pool after Roxy, so Jack assumes this means that Roxy dragged Ronnie under. Jack and his devastated mother-in-law, Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber), identify the bodies. Later, when Amy and Ricky ask where Ronnie and Roxy are, Jack says that they have \\"gone away\\" and will never come back, leaving them confused. They question Jack and Max about Ronnie and Roxy, so Jack's stepmother, Dot Branning (June Brown), explains to them with sensitivity that they are \\"God's angels\\" and are watching them in heaven. Frustrated with everyone taking pity on him and struggling to cope with Ronnie's death, Jack announces that, after the funeral, he will move to Ongar with the children. Jack is informed by the liaison officer that the coroner's report reveals Roxy suffered a cardiac arrest in the pool from which he concludes that cocaine contributed to her death, so he blames her for Ronnie's death. After Ronnie and Roxy's funerals, Glenda tells Jack she intends to take custody of Matthew. Her son Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) tries to bribe Jack in return for changing her mind, but Jack beats him up. Glenda tells Jack she is not doing it for financial gain. Realising that Glenda is being sincere and that he needs help, Jack asks Glenda to move in with him. An inquest rules that Ronnie and Roxy's deaths were due to misadventure and drugs in Roxy's system did not contribute, but Jack still blames Roxy for Ronnie's death. Jack is angered when Glenda gets Amy's ears pierced and throws Glenda out but later realises her intentions were good and agrees to still let her be part of Amy, Ricky and Matthew's lives. He refuses to commemorate Roxy with a headstone but reconsiders when Stacey reminds him that it is only punishing her family and Amy. Several months later, Jack decides he needs to move on with his life but still struggles to cope. Max makes contact with Matthew's father, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), and he returns the next day, telling Jack that they need to talk about Matthew. Jack is reluctant to let Charlie spend time with Matthew as Matthew does not know him. However, Max convinces him otherwise. Unbeknownst to Jack, Max and Charlie are secretly plotting against him. When Dot lets Jack know of Charlie's plan to return to Ireland with Matthew, Jack is infuriated. He declares that Charlie will never get custody of Matthew as this would mean breaking his promise to Ronnie. When Charlie says that Ronnie got what she deserved, Jack punches Charlie, only to be stopped by Max who tells Jack he may have lost his chances of keeping Matthew. Max is later disappointed when he learns from Jack's solicitor that Jack still has a strong chance of keeping Matthew, despite his fight with Charlie. Max visits Charlie and later, Jack is arrested for assaulting Charlie, though unbeknownst to Jack, Max has attacked Charlie to make his injuries worse and allowed Jack to take the blame. However, the charges against Jack are dropped. Charlie's wife, Liz Cotton (Michelle Connolly), speaks to Jack and Jack realises what is best for Matthew and gives Charlie residence of Matthew. Charlie promises that Jack can still see Matthew, though Jack is unaware that Max has paid Charlie to not contact Jack again. Realising he cannot cope with looking after Amy and Ricky as a single parent, Jack later hires Ingrid Solberg (Pernille Broch) to be their nanny. However after she shows repeated lateness, Jack offers her to move in with him and when the children start to like her, they decide to go camping together with Honey and her children, Janet (Grace) and Will (Freddie Phillips). When Jack is reminded that this is the first family trip without Ronnie, Ingrid comforts him telling him that he is venting his grief to the people he cares about. When their chemistry begins to grow, Jack and Ingrid share a passionate kiss which he instantly begins to regret. However they later decide to remain friends and Ingrid continues to look after Amy and Ricky. When the residents learn that Max has been involved in a redevelopment plan of Albert Square with James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), Jack supports him and discovers Max is self-harming. Jack, Lauren and Abi confront Max about the redevelopment plan where he reveals that his motive was for revenge, as everyone had abandoned him when he went to prison. Max then breaks all of Jack's family photos and tells him that their family is worth nothing. Despite this, Jack refuses to give up on Max. However, Charlie returns to Walford with Matthew and exposes the full extent of Max's betrayal to Jack. Jack is heartbroken when he learns that Max paid Charlie to take Matthew away from him and he also disowns Max, telling him that he is a lost cause and can never change. However, on the anniversary of Ronnie's death, Jack and Max reunite when Jack comforts Max when he breaks down due to Abi being critically ill. After Abi's funeral, Jack tries to woo Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) after she returns to Walford and rents a sports car, which initially impresses her but her son, Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter) sabotages the car so it will not start. Despite Hunter's attempts to stop it, Mel eventually starts a relationship with Jack. Jack proposes marriage to Mel, however, before she can respond, they are interrupted by Mel's efor husband Ray Kelly (Sean Mahon). Jack comforts Rainie and they have a one-night stand. Creation Scott Maslen was cast as Jack Branning. =Background= Jack Branning was one of several new characters to join the EastEnders cast in the second half of 2007. At a time when the show was undergoing media criticism for its resurrection of old characters, John Yorke, the BBC's controller of drama production, defended the show's ability to create interesting, new characters. He praised the show's executive producer Diederick Santer for his development of new, \\"strong characters\\", including Jack Branning and Roxy and Ronnie Mitchell. Speaking of this new wave of characters, he stated: \\"It feels like a new dynasty is emerging, which is important.\\" Prior to his introduction in October 2007, the character was referred to once, a week before his arrival. He is a member of the soap's Branning family; his sister Carol first appeared in the serial in 1993, while father Jim had appeared from 1996. More recently, brother Max and his own family were introduced in June 2006. =Casting= Scott Maslen was cast in the role of Jack. Previously best known for his role as DS Phil Hunter in ITV police drama The Bill, the media were quick to pick up on the fact his new role was notably similar - with TV critic Jane Simon sarcastically commenting: \\"What a relief it must be for actor Scott Maslen to get a role that allows him to show off his incredible versatility.\\" Maslen himself pointed out that the character of Jack was actually higher ranking than Phil Hunter, joking: \\"I've been promoted from playing a DS in Sun Hill!\\" Maslen's casting marked the first time an established actor had been poached from one mainstream soap to another. Speaking for the first time about his new role, Maslen said: \\"I was very sad to leave The Bill but after five years I wanted to explore new opportunities. The Bill afforded me some fantastic storylines. I'm really looking forward to playing Jack. He's an extremely competitive man who likes to win in business and in pleasure!\\" Development Upon announcing his casting, Maslen described the character of Jack as \\"an extremely competitive man who always likes to win in business and in pleasure\\". He mentioned that there would be an \\"instant attraction\\" between Jack and fellow newcomer Ronnie Mitchell, and explained that he already had a longstanding friendship with Samantha Womack who plays Ronnie, having known her since he was 16 years old, and being godfather to her children. The relationship between the two characters developed quickly from friendship to romance, with Womack commenting that due to her friendship with Maslen; \\"Our first kissing scene felt really uncomfortable, it was terrible, but we're over it now.\\" Several media publications commented on the fact that the attraction between the two characters had been obvious, and bound to develop into more than a professional relationship. As the character's personality developed, questions were raised over whether his intentions and motivations were good or bad, with Maslen explaining: \\"I call him amoral; neither good nor bad. He gets what he wants out of the situation but that isn‚Äôt necessarily just a selfish thing. He's not an evil character, but if there are people that are threatening him, his business or his family, he will do whatever he needs to do to eliminate that problem.\\" In April 2011, it was reported that Jack would have a one-night stand in May after trying to get over the loss of his son, and bed Tanya's sister, Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks). =Departure (2013)= In February 2013, it was announced that Maslen had quit his role as Jack and would leave the show later in the year at the end of his current contract. Maslen said, \\"I've loved playing Jack, and who wouldn't want to work on one of the most successful British TV series, but I've been offered many other roles and just not been able to explore them in the past, simply because of time and commitments to EastEnders, and so now it feels like the time to tread a new path for a while. I've played Jack for five and a half years and had some fantastic storylines, but it's now time to have a break from him and try something different. I'm incredibly attached to Jack, his family and EastEnders, but as an actor I'd like to take on some new challenges for a bit. EastEnders is just incredible, it's phenomenally rewarding and I love working here, but now it's time to move on to pastures new.\\" Executive producer Lorraine Newman said, \\"Since October 2007, Scott Maslen has brought the wonderful Jack Branning to life on our screens. From Scott's heart-wrenching portrayal of a grieving father, to Jack's determination in the coming week to take on Phil Mitchell, the variety in Scott's material shows his fabulous range as an actor. Scott will remain on your screens until late in the year, and there is plenty more drama to be played out before his departure.\\" =Reintroduction (2015)= Maslen made a surprise return as Jack on 24 December 2015 and departed once again on 1 January 2016. He returned full-time on 1 March 2016. Maslen said: \\"I'm looking forward to working with Dominic Treadwell-Collins. I worked with him before when he was a storyliner there. I'm really looking forward to working with him and the newer faces. There's so many exciting things going on at the minute. It was like I hadn't left. It felt a bit strange because there are new characters who I don't know - but that fits with the story. When you go away for a while and come back, there's always new people you gotta [sic] get to know and that's part of the fun of it. It felt great!\\"  Reception  Much media response to the character has centred around Maslen's good looks, with the Daily Express commenting: \\"At last. Someone remotely attractive comes to Albert Square.\\" The Mirror similarly referred to him as \\"the new hunk on the Square\\", as well as \\"the hottest property on EastEnders\\". Inside Soap praised Maslen's transition between roles, declaring his performance as Jack to be \\"flawless\\". However, The Times were more critical, writing of 2007's New Year's Eve episode: \\"The alleged erotic tension between Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) was so underplayed as to be invisible.\\" A reporter writing for the Inside Soap Yearbook 2017 (released in November 2016) described Jack's return as \\"a great arrival\\", before adding that he \\"made a very attractive birthday gift for Walford's Ronnie\\". Maslen was nominated at the 2011 Inside Soap Awards for 'Best Actor'. In August 2017, Maslen was longlisted for Best Actor at the Inside Soap Awards. He did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. Scenes broadcast on 3 January 2017, in which Jack struggles to tell Amy and Ricky that Ronnie and Roxy have died, were praised by bereaved children's charity Grief Encounter. A spokesperson for the charity said, \\"We are very thankful that such a high profile TV show has chosen to bring such a relevant issue to the forefront. Children's grief is normally a taboo subject, which needs to be talked about openly. EastEnders has handled the subject with an honest outlook, in that so many parents don't know how to tell their children the truth.\\" The charity's founder, Dr Shelley Gilbert, said the storyline was \\"so important to highlight the real struggle parents have when telling their young children that mummy or daddy has died\\" and said that Jack was having a \\"very real response in not knowing when and how to tell the children\\".

Only one example was constructed. Design The Cagnet was a two-seat pusher propeller aircraft. The side-by-side seating was in an open cockpit just ahead of the strut-mounted inline engine. The low cantilever wings featured a gull shape, with twin booms mounted, one at each wing's bend point. A horizontal stabilizer and elevator ran between twin fins with rudders, one at the end of each boom. The fixed landing gear used a nosewheel. First flight was in 1939; the aircraft bore the serial number T46. General Aircraft proposed the Cagnet as a basic trainer. It was tested as a Flying Observation post trainer by the Royal School of Army Co-operation from February through June 1940 (with military serial number W7646). After that testing, it underwent various other tests. Its final flight was in 1941. The engine was a Blackburn Cirrus Minor, which gave a cruising speed of 100 mph (160 km/h).

In a computer, the memory bank may be determined by the memory controller along with physical organization of the hardware memory slots. In a typical synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) or double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory (DDR SDRAM), a bank consists of multiple rows and columns of storage units, and is usually spread out across several chips. In a single read or write operation, only one bank is accessed, therefore the number of bits in a column or a row, per bank and per chip, equals the memory bus width in bits (single channel). The size of a bank is further determined by the number of bits in a column and a row, per chip, multiplied by the number of chips in a bank. Some computers have several identical memory banks of RAM, and use bank switching to switch between them. Harvard architecture computers have (at least) two very different banks of memory, one for program storage and other for data storage. In caching A memory bank is a part of cache memory that is addressed consecutively in the total set of memory banks, i.e., when data item is stored in bank , data item is stored in bank .

She shared the prestigious ASCAP Foundation Sammy Cahn Award for 2009 with Oren Lavie. She is married to fellow musician, and music producer, Paul Curreri. After birth of their daughter in 2016, Sproule returned to touring with the release of The Gold String in early 2017. Early life Born to hippie parents on a commune named Dandelion in Kingston, Ontario, Sproule claims citizenship of both Canada and the United States. Her parents were both musicians. She spent her childhood on the , 100-member Twin Oaks Community founded in 1967 as an intentional community and ecovillage in Louisa County, Virginia. Asked about how the experience has affected her musical career, she said: After moving between private, public and home schooling, she eventually left high school, recorded her first record, and began touring nationally ‚Äì all before the age of eighteen.  Career  By 25, Sproule had already released four albums, drawing from influences as diverse as Frank Zappa, Bikini Kill, and a range of Canadian folk music. A year after releasing her debut album Devon in 1999, she attracted the attention of fellow Charlottesville resident Dave Matthews who offered her a spot on a tour with the Dave Matthews Band. Bassist Stefan Lessard produced her next album Long Sleeve Story in 2001. The release of Upstate Songs in 2003 coincided with a move to upstate New York. The edgier sound, with a more folk-driven feel, represented a departure ‚Äì and helped her gain national prominence. Upstate Songs was critically acclaimed with Rolling Stone Magazine naming it to their Critics Top Albums of 2003. Julie Gerstein called the record, \\"perhaps the sweetest and most honest folk-pop album recorded this year,\\" and added, \\"Sproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.\\"\\"Our Critics Top Albums of 2003: Strokes, Shins and a whole lot of OutKast\\" posted 31 December 2003 Rolling Stone Magazine. At a show in Charlottesville, fellow musician Paul Curreri jumped on stage with her and joined in singing. They married in 2005 and often performed together locally. They also tour together across the United States and United Kingdom. They were regular favorites at the now-defunct Gravity Lounge, a major platform for new talent in their hometown. Curreri often \\"sings, plays, mixes, and produces\\" his wife's recordings. In September 2011 Sproule and Curreri moved to Berlin, Germany, citing professional and economic reasons. \\"It felt like a good career move, to not just grow careers, but to make money, which is hard when you're going back and forth,\\" says Sproule. \\"It's really fun to play over there where you can play the folk shows, but you can also play a little theater of 20-year-olds who are sitting on the floor and they're blogging about it the next day.\\" After living in Austin for a time, they've returned to Charlottesville. As Sproule says, \\"Everything that led away from Virginia felt necessary, and so did the coming home.\\" Recordings On stage at Canada Day festival Trafalgar Square London 2011 She released her first album when she was 16. Her second album, Long Sleeve Story, was released in 2001 with praise from The Village Voice. Upstate Songs, released in 2003, made it in Rolling Stone's Critics Top Albums of the year, followed by Keep Your Silver Shined in March 2007. She and Paul Curreri performed two tracks from the album, Old Virginia Block and Stop By Anytime, on the BBC's renowned Later With Jools Holland show in 2007. ¬°Don't Hurry for Heaven! was released in April 2009. Live in London, recorded with a collection of musicians including English pedal steel player BJ Cole, was released in 2010. I Love You Go Easy was released on Tin Angel Records in 2011 to further critical acclaim, accompanied by the single Now's the Time. It features a cover of Terre Roche's Runs in the Family. In the spring of 2013, Devon went into the studio in Toronto to record an album of songs co-written with Canadian singer-songwriter Mike O'Neill. A video for the song You Can't Help It was released in the summer and the resulting record, Colours, was released in September 2013. Musicians featuring on the record include Thom Gill and Robin Dann. Sproule announced her return to touring, after birth of her daughter in 2016, with The Gold String, released 24 March 2017. The LP contains \\"North American music with weirdo roots\\" and was recorded in three Canadian provinces ‚Äî Yukon, Ontario, and Nova Scotia ‚Äî and the Shetland Islands. It features backing from \\"Toronto dream- poppers\\" Bernice and Sproule's husband Paul Curreri. The idea for the album began with a stay in remote the Shetland islands off Scotland \\"when she first started following a thread.\\" As Jane Dunlap Sathe of The Daily Progress stated: \\"The Gold String\\" started as a song and then the concept developed into an album.  Tours and festivals  Sproule began touring nationally she was eighteen with the Dave Matthews Band. She tours across the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom regularly ‚Äì often with her husband Paul Curreri. In 2011 Sproule performed at the Bergenfest in Norway and the Canada Day festival in Trafalgar Square, London. She has appeared at numerous other music festivals in her career.

History and overview The construction was begun by Gian Giacomo Dolcebuono and Giovanni Battagio in 1493, to house a miraculous icon of the Madonna, initially on the central plan. The first part to be built was the octagonal dome, covered externally by a tambour with a loggia and arcades decorated by twelve brickwork statues by Agostino De Fondulis, designed in Lombard style by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo (1494-1498). Fa√ßade. In 1506 to the original edifice a complex with nave and two aisles was added, the former covered by a monumental barrel vault also by Amadeo; the presbytery received a polygonal ambulatory inspired to that in the Duomo. In the 16th century also the square portico in classical style was added, perhaps designed by Cesare Cesariano or Cristoforo Lombardo (il Lombardino). The massive eclectic and Mannerist style fa√ßade was designed by Galeazzo Alessi in the late 16th century and was realized by Martino Bassi; it is decorated by numerous statues and reliefs by Stoldo Lorenzi and Annibale Fontana. From 1595 the organist was the keyboard virtuoso Giovanni Paolo Cima.\` Interior The interior houses numerous works by Milanese Renaissance and Baroque artists: Giovan Battista Crespi (il Cerano), Camillo and Giulio Cesare Procaccini, Carlo Francesco Nuvolone, Antonio Campi, Bergognone, Callisto Piazza and others. Notable are the Baptism of Jesus by Gaudenzio Ferrari and Giovan Battista della Cerva, the Fall of St. Paul by Moretto and, on the altar of the right transept, an altarpiece by Paris Bordone. The lectern of the choir is by Giuseppe Meda. San Celso. In the left transept, within an altar designed by Martino Bassi, is the venerated marble statue of the Assunta by Annibale Fontana (1586) with two later angels by Giulio Cesare Procaccini. San Celso Annexed to Santa Maria is the Romanesque church of San Celso, dedicated to the martyr Saint Celsus, which was largely demolished. It was founded in the 4th century and rebuilt in the 11th century. The fa√ßade (remade in the 19th century) has a rose window and a Romanesque portal with animal figures decoration. Also from the 11th century is the bell tower.

It has narrow leaves arranged in opposite pairs, and usually white flowers arranged in heads of seven or more on the ends of the stems, with four lance-shaped bracts at the base of the inflorescence. The plant may be toxic to livestock. Description Pimelea linifolia is a variable shrub, sometimes prostrate, sometimes growing to a height of with glabrous stems. The leaves are glabrous, narrow egg-shaped to elliptic, long and wide. The flowers are white, sometimes pink, mostly long. They are arranged in heads of between seven and sixty on the ends of the stems, with four, sometimes eight bracts at the base. Some flowers are bisexual and others are female, the female flowers shorter. The bracts are sessile, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide. The fruit is green and long. Taxonomy and naming Pimelea linifolia was first formally described in 1793 by James Edward Smith from a specimen that \\"flowered in the greenhouse of Lord Viscount Lewisham in February 1794\\". Distribution and habitat Slender rice flower is widespread and common in eastern Australia. It usually grows in wet forest, sometimes on the margin of rainforest. It occurs from north-east Queensland, through the eastern half of New South Wales, all but the far north-west of Victoria, the south-east of South Australia and throughout Tasmania. Ecology This plant is suspected of being poisonous to sheep, but the evidence is inconclusive. Uses The bark of P. linifolia can be processed into fine strong thread for catching the bogong moth (Agrotis infusa). This string, called a 'Bushman's bootlace', is produced by a traditional method that involves wetting, drying, beating and rolling the material.

The First Turn-On! is usually considered by Troma fans to be the best of the company's \\"sexy comedies\\". This was Vincent D'Onofrio's film debut. Plot On the last day of summer at Camp Big-Tee-Pee, all the teenage campers are crazy with hormones and eager to go home. While on a nature walk with ditzy hippie camp counselor Michelle Farmer, four students - self-proclaimed stud Mitch, his girlfriend Annie, overweight Henry, and nerd Danny - break off from the rest of the group to indulge in some cannabis. They take refuge in a nearby cave, only to be caught in the act by Michelle some time later. While being shooed out, Henry's flatulence causes a landslide, trapping the five of them inside. To pass the time until their eventual rescue, the group shares stories of how each lost their virginity. In Mitch's story, Lucy, an elegant prostitute, picks up Mitch while he is hitchhiking and invites him to visit her fancy hotel room. Feeling nervous and inexperienced, he asks his ultra-cool, yet dim-witted friend Jeff to give him pointers (which include \\"when in doubt, whip it out\\"). However, upon meeting Lucy, Jeff unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Lucy, almost injuring her. When Mitch saves her and kicks Jeff out, Lucy repays him with mind-blowing sex. Henry is forced to tell his story next. In preparation for a big Halloween party, he dresses as a ghost. Unfortunately, in addition to not being able to see out of the eye-holes, the costume looks identical to a Klan robe. Blinded, he accidentally stumbles upon a group of (flamboyantly gay) African-American thugs about to kill a young white woman. The thugs turn their attention to Henry, beat him senseless, and then skip off, singing and holding hands. The girl, convinced Henry has just saved her life, instantly falls for him and the two make passionate love later that night next to a giant pile of donuts. Meanwhile, the camp's staff, in fear of a potentially expensive lawsuit, desperately search for the missing campers. In Annie's story, she discusses her first time, back when she was working on her family's farm. One night, she discovers an attractive drifter who had broken into her house in search of food. Overwhelmed by her hormones, she gives him a lot more than cookies in the back of the barn, much to the dismay of the sheep. Danny goes next: His flashback reveals that he was a pornography-addicted loser. While visiting the beach one day, he thinks he sees Penthouse Pet Sheila Kennedy smiling and winking at him, but quickly dismisses it as a mirage. Later that night, after being rejected from a double date with his brother, Danny returns to his room to find Kennedy waiting for him. While the two engage in lengthy foreplay, they are later joined by his brother's girlfriend, and they all participate in an orgy, which Danny mispronounces. Finally, Miss Farmer tells her story: Back in high school she was deeply in love with her psychotic, nerd boyfriend Dwayne. However, when Dwayne dumps her for another girl at the junior prom, she sucks up her pride and picks up two new boyfriends. The three of them proceed to have sex on a bowling alley lane. As more time passes and oxygen diminishes in the cave, the gang becomes convinced that they will all asphyxiate. In a moment of truth, everyone admits that their stories were false. They're all still virgins. Determined not to die as such, they all participate in an orgy. The symphony of thrusts and moans causes another landslide, thus opening the entrance of the cave and freeing everyone. As the group returns to camp, a narrator reveals the character's futures: Danny became a pornographic actor under the name \\"Dicky Long\\". Mitch became a priest and a staunch advocate of gay rights. Henry now works for the National Cheese Commissioners Board. After eight marriages, Annie had a nervous breakdown and became a vegetable. Miss Farmer runs the government's program for Wildlife Preservation. The film's final shot shows her trying to make a large trout \\"fly away\\" by tossing it into the air. Re-release The film was re-released on DVD in late 2009, with new interviews with Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz as well as new special features and an old Kaufman/Herz movie as an easter egg.

The opposite of ex- ante is ex-post (actual) (or ex post). Buying a lottery ticket loses you money ex ante (in expectation), but if you win, it was the right decision ex post. Examples: * In the financial world, the ex-ante return is the expected return of an investment portfolio. * In the recruitment industry, ex-ante is often used when forecasting resource requirements on large future projects. The ex- ante (and ex-post) reasoning in economic topics was introduced mainly by Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal in his 1927‚Äì39 work on monetary theory, who described it in this way: Focusing attention on the relation between saving and investment, Myrdal argued that one may without any contradiction consider that, as they are made by separate agents, ex ante saving and investment decisions are not at parity in general while ex post saving and investment are recorded in bookkeeping balance exactly: This analysis has become a standard tool in macroeconomics. Prices are quantities that directly refer to a point of time: they are determined at a point of time, after an ex ante adjustment process has taken place. As for the macroeconomic quantities, Myrdal proposed to refer to the point of time at which they are calculated. Gunnar Myrdal further explained that ex ante disparity and ex post balance are made consistent through price changes, which result from the behavior of economic agents, which is based on ex ante anticipations: In context of ex-ante, the Swedish economist Myrdal also dealt with the question of the unit of time, which he proposed to solve by reducing the actual time-dimension of macroeconomic variables such as income, saving and investment to a point of time: Economist G. L. S. Shackle claimed the importance of Gunnar Myrdal¬¥s analysis by which saving and investment are allowed to adjust ex ante to each other. However, the reference to ex ante and ex post analysis has become so usual in modern macroeconomics that the position of John Maynard Keynes to not include it in his work was currently considered as an oddity, if not a mistake.

Born at Newcastle upon Tyne, Harvey was the son of a bath-keeper. At the age of 14, he was apprenticed to Thomas Bewick, and became one of his favorite pupils. Bewick describes him as one \\"who both as an engraver & designer, stands preeminent\\" at his day (Memoir, p. 200). He engraved many woodblocks for Bewick's Aesop's Fables (1818). Harvey moved to London in 1817, studying drawing with Benjamin Haydon, and anatomy with Charles Bell. In 1821, he made a wood-engraving after Haydon in imitation of engraving, the large block of the Assassination of L. S. Dentatus. This was probably the then most ambitious woodblock which had been cut in England. Harvey switched to design, after the death of John Thurston, the then leading wood designer in London. One of his earliest works is his illustrations for Alexander Henderson's History of Ancient and Modern Wines in 1824. His masterpieces are his illustrations to Northcote's Fables (1823‚Äì33) and to E. W. Lane's The Arabian Nights' Entertainments (1838‚Äì40). Harvey is buried in Richmond Cemetery.

One of several √©migr√© field armies, it was the only one to survive the War of the First Coalition; others had been formed by the Comte d'Artois (brother of King Louis XVI) and Mirabeau-Tonneau. The √©migr√© armies were formed by aristocrats and nobles who had fled from the violence in France after the August Decrees. The army was commanded by Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√©, the cousin of Louis XVI of France. Among its members were Cond√©'s grandson, the Duc d'Enghien and the two sons of Louis XVI's younger brother, the Comte d'Artois, and so the army was sometimes also called the Princes' Army. Financial difficulties forced Cond√© to appeal to foreign courts for support. Although the Army fought in conjunction with the Austrian army, many of the generals in Habsburg service distrusted Louis Joseph and policy makers in Vienna considered the army and its officers unreliable. Furthermore, conflicting goals of the French royalists and the Habsburgs frequently placed Louis Joseph at odds with the Habsburg military leadership. Composition of the army Other than the princes, it also included many young aristocrats such as the Duc de Richelieu, the Duc de Blacas and Chateaubriand, the Duc de Choiseul, the Comte de Lang√©ron, the Comte de Damas, the Comte de Montlosier and the Vicomte de Bonald.Francois Furet, Mona Ozouf. ‚ÄúA Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, ‚ÄúEmigres‚Äù. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989. p. 328. The insistence of the officers on the same pay to which they were entitled in France created problems for their funders, which included Spain, Portugal, and Naples, and Britain, and finally, Russia. The British funded the army the longest, from 1795 to 1797, and again, in 1799 until its dissolution in 1801. Originally about 25,000 men, the size of the prince's army varied, depending in great part upon the demands placed upon it, but also on the funding available. By the end of 1792, the force had 5,000 men. After recruiting in 1796, in the cities of Mainz and Mannheim, and in the Swiss cantons, it could call on 10,000 men, under the pay of Britain.George Ripley. The New American cyclopedia: a popular dictionary of General knowledge. ‚ÄúHouse of Cond√© ‚Äù New York : D. Appleton, 1869-70. Volume 5, p. 597. =Structure= The composition of the army varied: the regiments of Mirabeau, Rohan and Salms, for example, were almost independent corps. Conflicting goals The army of the √©migr√©s had but a single goal, to invade France, end the Revolution, and restore Bourbon rule. However, the various nations who funded the army were less interested in restoring order in France than in gaining new territory for themselves and keeping the Revolution confined within French borders. This often led to friction between the Prince's Army and its benefactors, particularly the Austrians. At one point the Emperor put the Cond√© himself under arrest for insubordination. Action This army participated in the War of the First Coalition from 1792 to 1797 alongside Austria, initially sharing in the unsuccessful invasion of France by the Allies under Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick. At Metz, 3‚Äì4000 French republicans faced an Austrian-√âmigr√© siege force of 20,000. Expecting the fortress to surrender without a fight, the Austrians and √©migr√©s under command of the Prince of Bourbon, did not bring any siege cannon. Although losses were slight (about 10 killed or wounded), the failure to take Thionville from 2 battalions of Infantry and some National Guardsmen rankled. In the previous 3 weeks, Austrians and Prussian forces had successfully forced the capitulation of Longwy and Verdun.Digby Smith. Longwy, Verdun and Thionville, pp 24-25. Two weeks later, after the cannonade at Valmy, the √©migr√© army and the Austrians, did not get to the battlefield until most of the fighting was over and the Prussians were withdrawing. By 1795, the Army of Cond√© fought in conjunction with the Austrian army, under command of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. In 1794, through the negotiations of William Wickham, the British agreed to pay the Corps' expenses. In June 1796, the Cond√©'s army and the Swabian Circle contingent guarded the Rhine river crossing at Kehl, but were pushed out when the French crossed the river in force on June 26.Digby Smith, Napoleonic Wars Databook. Mechanicsburg: Stackpole, 1996. Afterward, the Cond√©'s corps and the Contingent fought in Swabia, as part of the division of Karl Aloys von F√ºrstenberg. After the contingent was disbanded, the Corps remained in Swabia, participating in the summer fighting Swabia. In October 1796, at the Battle of Schliengen, the Corps made a spirited attack on the village of Steinstadt, which they took with a bayonet charge and remained there under severe artillery and musket fire for the rest of the daylight hours.Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch. The History of the campaign of 1796 in Germany and Italy. London, 1797, p. 122. Charles was so pleased with the performance of the Corps that he sent a formal congratulatory note to the Prince. After the interim cease fire, the Corps garrisoned in the region of Lake Constance. The agreement negotiated between Conde and Wickham expired and the Corps entered the pay of the Tsar of Russia. In October, the entire Corps, numbering about 10,000, left the Bodensee region and marched toward Russia. In October 1797, Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio with the First French Republic, formally ending its hostilities against the French. With the end of the First Coalition, the army marched to Poland, returning in 1799 to Switzerland under command of Alexander Suvorov. In 1800, when Russia left the Second Coalition, the English agreed once again to pay the Conde's army and it fought in Bavaria until 1801, when the Corps was disbanded.

It broadcasts music (principally classical music and jazz) and also carries educational programming as well as programmes in minority languages. The channel began life in 1955 as Sweden's second radio channel. In 1966, SR gave its channels distinct profiles, making P2 the channel for education, regional programming, and \\"serious\\" music. Regional radio later became local radio and was moved to P3 ‚Äì still later to P4 ‚Äì leaving P2 with the profile it has today. The music played on P2 is mostly classical in the broadest sense (from the earliest known compositions to 20th-century and contemporary works), but also features jazz, folk and \\"world music\\": in this respect P2 can be compared toaccording to whom? many other similar public radio stations around the world, such as ABC Classic FM, BBC Radio 3, CBC Radio 2, DR P2, France Musique, Polskie Radio Dw√≥jka, RDP Antena 2, RNE Radio Cl√°sica, WDR 3, and Ylen Klassinen. P2 also features contemporary electronic music two hours a week. Programming in minority languages is contributed by SR Sisuradio, Sameradion, and SR International. Educational programmes from Utbildningsradion are also broadcast on P2. These educational and minority programmes, however, constitute only a small part of P2's schedule, and they are mainly broadcast in the early morning and in the afternoon. SR also produces an all-music version of P2 under the name \\"P2 Musik\\" in which the minority-language and educational programming is replaced by music (largely from the webradio channel SR Klassiskt). This is available on the web and, in the capital only, on 96.2 FM from P2's Stockholm transmitter.

That is, for exactly three polygon vertices, the line segment connecting the two neighbors of the vertex does not cross the polygon. For two of these vertices (the ears) the line segment connecting the neighbors forms a diagonal of the polygon, contained within the polygon. For the third vertex (the mouth) the line segment connecting the neighbors lies outside the polygon, forming the entrance to a concavity of the polygon.. Every simple polygon has at least two ears (this is the two ears theorem) and every non- convex simple polygon has at least one mouth, so in some sense the anthropomorphic polygons are the simplest possible non-convex simple polygons.

Chamberlain had been Prime Minister until May 1940, and had held the Edgbaston seat since the 1929 general election. The Conservative candidate, Peter Bennett, was returned unopposed.

The vessels were constructed in the Soviet Union and purchased by the Finnish Navy between 1974 and 1975. The vessels were similar to the Soviet Project 205U Tsunami class missile boats, known in the west as Osa II. All of the vessels were later modified into fast minelayers at Aker Finnyards when their armament became obsolete. The modification work took place between 1993 and 1994 at the Uusikaupunki yards. Tuima and Tuuli had their missiles removed and the superstructure was modified. Mine rails and mine loading equipment were installed and the weapons guidance systems were modernized. Tuisku and Tyrsky were also modernized into fast minelayers, but less extensively, removing their missile weapons, and installing mine rails. The Tuima class vessels belonged to the 5th Minewarfare Squadron based at Upinniemi. The vessels of the class were decommissioned by 2000. The Tuima class had three 56-cylinder radial diesel engines, each one producing 3 500 kW. The middle engine and propeller shaft of Tuima and Tuuli were removed during the modernization to make space for the mine laying equipment. This lowered the top-speed by 7 knots. The class was known amongst the Finnish Navy conscripts as Tuska (Agony) class or Moskvich after a Russian car brand of that name. They were not considered as pleasant places to serve because of their poor ergonomy. After decommissioning, the vessels were moored at Loviisa, and it was planned that one was to be transferred to the new Maritime Museum in Kotka. However, in October 2006, the Finnish Ministry of Defence stated that all four were to be sold to Egypt where they were refitted and taken into active service.Loviisan sanomat article Vessels of the class ;FNS Tuima (11): ;FNS Tuuli (12): ;FNS Tuisku (14): ;FNS Tyrsky (15): References Category:Missile boat classes Category:Missile boats of the Finnish Navy Category:Minelayers of the Finnish Navy Category:Minelayers of the Egyptian Navy Category:Missile boats of the Soviet Union ","title":"Tuima-class missile boat"},{"id":"12233196","title":"2003 Norwegian county council election"},{"id":"12233199","text":"Leonardo Gon√ßalves Silva or simply Leonardo (born October 26, 1982 in Nova Lima), is a striker.

A keen rackets player, he was a member with Gem of the Bath Street Racquets Club adjacent to the Racquet Court Inn in Bath Street, Birmingham, about two miles from his home Fairlight at 8 Ampton Road, Edgbaston. It was on the croquet lawn of this house that Perera and Gem were to develop a game that combined elements of both the game of rackets and Basque pelota between 1859 and 1865,\\"Lawn Tennis and Major T.

In 1873,Hooper, p.14 Perera and Gem moved to Royal Leamington Spa and established a club to play their new game on the lawns of the Manor House Hotel, opposite Perera's new home in Avenue Road. Perera left Leamington three years after Gem's death in 1881 and his life after this date is unknown.Tennis Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2007. Accessed 11 July 2007 Tennis' true inventor? The invention of tennis is traditionally ascribed to Major Walter Clopton Wingfield, who published rules for a game he called sphairistik√® in 1874. It is Wingfield's statue that stands at the headquarters of the Lawn Tennis Association. However in his meticulously-researched work, Tennis: A Cultural History, Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on 8 December 1874, Wingfield had written to Harry Gem, commenting that he‚Äôd been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis for only a year and a half.[Leamington Tennis Court Club http://www.leamingtonrealtennis.co.uk/history-of-the-game/leamington-and- tennis.html] It is now no longer in dispute (despite the traditional credit given to Wingfield) that Gem and Perera, who had established an organized lawn tennis club in Leamington Spa 1874, had been playing their invention for a decade or more. In addition, much less is known about Perera than his friend and fellow tennis pioneer Harry Gem, whose life is well documented as a prominent figure in several walks of Birmingham society. In a letter to The Field in November 1874, however, Gem himself largely credited Perera with the development of the game.

Amandus Heinrich Adamson (12 November 1855 in Uuga-R√§tsepa, near Paldiski ‚Äì 26 June 1929 in Paldiski) was an Estonian sculptor and painter. Life Born into a seafaring family, Adamson excelled in wood carving as a child. He moved to St. Petersburg in 1875 to study at the Imperial Academy of Arts under Alexander Bock. After graduation he continued to work as a sculptor and teacher in St. Petersburg, with an interruption from 1887 through 1891 to study in Paris and Italy, influenced by the French sculptors Jules Dalou and Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. Adamson produced his best-known work in 1902. His Russalka Memorial, dedicated to the 177 lost sailors of the Ironclad warship Rusalka, features a bronze angel on a slender column. The other work is architectural. His four allegorical bronzes for the Elisseeff department store in St. Petersburg (for architect Gavriil Baranovsky), and the French-style caryatids and finial figures for the Singer House (for architect Pavel Suzor) are major components of the \\"Russian Art Nouveau\\" visible along Nevsky Prospekt. He was named an academician of the Imperial Academy in 1907. In 1918, in the context of the Russian Revolution and the Estonian War of Independence, Adamson returned to his home town of Paldiski in northwestern Estonia, where he spent the rest of his life.

The plot is remarkably similar to that of Stanley Kubrick's The Killing, released only three years previous. Filmed in 1958 under the title Blood Money, it was released by executive producer Roger Corman as a double feature with T-Bird Gang in his first Filmgroup release.p. 27 Ray, Fred Olen The New Poverty Row: Independent Filmmakers as Distributors McFarland High School Big Shot was featured on an episode of the comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000. Plot Marv Grant is a high school student who lives with his deadbeat, alcoholic father. At school he begins dating the attractive Betty Alexander (Virginia Aldridge), who eventually manipulates him into writing her English class term paper for her. Marv does this, but the subterfuge is easily uncovered by the professor. Betty fails the class, and the professor withdraws his recommendation from Marv's college application, without which Marv has no chance of earning a scholarship. In anger, Betty throws Marv over and returns to her old boyfriend, Vince, revealing that she had only been using Marv from the beginning. At his part-time job at the docks, Marv overhears his boss plotting a drug transaction worth $1 million cash. The money will be kept in the office safe prior to the deal. In despair, Marv plots to steal the money, with the help of safecracker Harry March and Sam Tolman, to cure troubles with his father and Betty and he secures $550,000 of the take for himself. He tells Betty about the pending robbery to entice her to marry him, and she apparently accedes. In reality she secretively tasks her boyfriend, Vince, to steal the money from Marv. Marv and his associates steal the money, but things then go horribly wrong when it's discovered Marv's father has hanged himself, then Vince and two accomplices intervene and shoots Sam, and he is horrified. When Betty arrives on the scene soon afterwards, Vince accuses her of making him do this, and he kills her, too. Vince's accomplices flee, but the police soon arrive. Marv is arrested and the money falls into the water, being lost. Similarities to The Killing The plot may have been adapted from that of The Killing. In that film, George Peatty (Elisha Cook Jr.) is a window teller at a racetrack. He has a shrewish wife, Sherry (Marie Windsor), who is bitter that he has not delivered on the promises of wealth he made at the time of their marriage. She is also cheating on him. A veteran criminal approaches George about being the inside man on a $2 million heist at the racetrack. Hoping to please his wife, George agrees, and he also tells her about the robbery. Sherry does not believe him at first, but, once she learns that the robbery is real, she recruits her lover, Val Cannon (Vince Edwards), to steal the money from her husband. The robbery succeeds, but George and his accomplices are held up by Val and his men. A shootout ensues in which all but George are killed. George goes home to confront his wife, and kills her before dying himself. The last man left with the loot attempts to flee by plane, but the suitcase full of money breaks open on the tarmac and the contents are scattered to the winds. Production The film was financed by Roger Corman who was particularly impressed by the performance of Tom Pittman in the lead.Ed. J. Philip di Franco, The Movie World of Roger Corman, Chelsea House Publishers, 1979 p 137 In February 1959 Filmgroup announced they would release ten films. Their first movies were High School Big Shot (1959) and T-Bird Gang (1959) produced by Stanley Bickman. Mystery Science Theater 3000 In 1994, the film was featured in a sixth-season episode of the movie-parody series Mystery Science Theater 3000. The main topics of ridicule were Marv's wimpy demeanor, huge lips and awkward appearance, his father's pathetic alcoholism, and the overall bleak nature of the film. The ending in particular prompted the writers to dub it \\"one of the most depressing films we've ever seen\\" and include a skit where the characters of the show \\"kill\\" each other with water guns to mock the fact that most of the major characters were killed in a brief moment of time, nearly one after the other.

Adapted from the 1966 novel Ranjau Sepanjang Jalan (No Harvest But a Thorn), by Malaysian author Shahnon Ahmad, which is set in the Malaysian state of Kedah, Rice People is the story of a rural family in post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia, struggling to bring in a single season's rice crop. It was filmed in the Cambodian village of Kamreang, in the Kien Svay and Boeung Thom areas of Kandal Province near Phnom Penh, on the banks of the Mekong River.

For a generation of children, the rice comes not from the ground, but from a sack, offloaded from the back of a United Nations relief truck. So it is in these uncertain times, that a Cambodian family is attempting to grow rice. The father, Pouev, is concerned that the family's plot of land is shrinking, and he might not be able to grow a big enough crop. The mother, Om, is worried for her husband, and her worst fears are confirmed when Poeuv steps on a poisonous thorn, and then, after a protracted period of being bedridden, dies of infection. Om is unable to handle the pressure of being the head of the family, nor does she have the strength to tend to the rice fields. She turns to alcohol and gambling and is eventually locked up for her mental illness. Responsibility for bringing in the crop and raising her six sisters falls on the oldest girl, Sakha.

History and operations The hospital has its origins in several of the former Monaghan County Jail buildings which were converted for clinical use as Monaghan Infirmary after purchase in the 1890s by a Board of Governors for a local medical facility. The first infirmary opened in 1896. The old main jail building was razed and the building of a new County Hospital commenced in 1933. The purpose-built hospital was officially opened on the site in 1938. In 2006 the hospital's treatment room function was moved from a doctor-led to a nurse-led basis, with many cases to be handled at Cavan General Hospital thereafter. On 22 July 2009, all acute care ceased at Monaghan, with only day surgery and minor injury treatment to continue at the location, along with the provision of 13 \\"step-down\\" and 13 rehabilitation beds. The decision, which led to the redeployment of 130 staff, was opposed by local politicians, general practitioners, nurses and some consultants. Operations Since the hospital ceased providing acute services in 2009, it has focussed on rehabilitation and \\"step-down\\" services. A minor injuries unit remains on the site, as do out-patient and day operations.

She was the wife, then widow, of the mathematician and philosopher Nicolas de Condorcet, who died during the Reign of Terror. Despite his death, and the exile of her brother Marshal Emmanuel, Marquis de Grouchy between 1815 and 1821, she maintained her own identity and was well-connected and influential before, during, and after the French Revolution. As a hostess, Madame de Condorcet was popular for her kind heart, beauty, and indifference to a person's class or social origins. Unlike that of her fellow-Girondist hostess Madame Roland, Madame de Condorcet's salons always included other women, notably Olympe de Gouges. De Condorcet was also a writer and a translator in her own right, highly educated for her day, completely fluent in English and Italian . She produced influential translations of Thomas Paine and Adam Smith. Background Born Marie-Louise-Sophie de Grouchy, daughter of Francoise Jacques de Grouchy, 1st Marquis de Grouchy (born 1715, a former page of Louis XV) by his intellectual wife Marie Gilberte Henriette Fr√©teau de P√©ny,, daughter of Michel Louis Fr√©teau de P√©ny, Seigneur de Vaux-le-P√©nil. In 1786 Sophie de Grouchy married the famous mathematician and philosopher Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet (17 September 1743-28‚Äì29 March 1794). Then 21 or 22, she was an acknowledged beauty; he was 42 and Inspector-General of the Mint and a prominent French Academician. Although there was a twenty-year age difference, the two shared many intellectual interests, and had a strong and happy marriage. The salon After her marriage, Madame de Condorcet started a famous salon at H√¥tel des Monnaies in Paris, opposite the Louvre, and later at the Rue de Lille in Paris, that was attended by, among many others, many foreign visitors including Thomas Jefferson, British aristocrats Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope, David Murray, 7th Viscount Stormont (later 2nd Earl of Mansfield), the economist Adam Smith, the Marquis de Beccaria, Turgot, the writer Pierre Beaumarchais, the pamphleteer Olympe de Gouges, the writer and hostess Germaine de Sta√´l and many French philosophers. This salon played an important role in the rise of the Girondin movement that stressed the rights of women. Sophie de Condorcet allowed the Cercle Social ‚Äî an association with the goal of equal political and legal rights for women ‚Äî to meet at her house. Its members included women's rights advocate Olympe de Gouges who had published the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen (1791). It has been argued that Sophie de Condorcet's own interest in women's rights were responsible for her husband's arguments for greater rights for women in the ten-page essay \\"Sur l‚Äôadmission des femmes au droit de cit√©\\" (3 July 1790). Unfortunately, this essay had little influence in its day, being overshadowed by the more passionate essays by British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (who visited Paris from 1791 to 1793) and de Gouges; the latter for certain attended Madame de Condorcet's salons. Proscription and death of the Marquis de Condorcet  Claire Tomalin's The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft mentions their sad history. The Marquis de Condorcet denounced the new Jacobin constitution which had no safeguards of the kind envisaged by him and the Girondins, and then went into hiding for eight months. His wife visited him secretly. Along with his friends, she encouraged de Condorcet to continue to write while in hiding. During this period, 1793‚Äì1794, he composed his most famous work‚Äî Esquisse d'un Tableau Historique des Progr√®s de l'Esprit Humain (Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind). He also wrote Avis d'un Proscrit √† sa Fille for his young daughter. While the Marquis was in hiding, his wife filed for divorce, with his secret consent. Their relationship remained strong, but due to laws allowing the government to confiscate the property of proscribed citizens, a divorce would enable his wife and daughter to keep their family assets. The Marquis, hearing of a coming raid, lost his nerve and fled his friend's roof, believing that his presence had been detected. He approached the country home of the Suards hoping they would shelter him, but Suard refused him shelter, claiming that a patriot servant in their home would betray Condorcet. Mme. Suard, with whom Condorcet had once been in love and had exchanged letters with for many years, wrote afterwards in a very sentimental tone (probably falsely, as she had been upset with him ever since his marriage to Sophie) of her guilt and wishes that she could have protected him. He was discovered shortly afterwards in a tavern at the edge of the city. The suspicious peasants there handed him over to the authorities, and he was found dead after the first night in prison. Although he might have died of hardship, an embolism, or other natural causes, most historians today believe that he poisoned himself, possibly with the help of his sister-in-law's lover Cabinis. According to Tomalin, Sophie de Condorcet was not informed about his death until several months later. Madame de Condorcet had his last works published posthumously, starting with the Sketch or Equisse in 1795. Translations and the revival of the salon Sophie de Condorcet was rendered penniless by her husband's proscription and his death which came before their divorce. Her financial circumstances compelled to support not only herself and her then four-year-old daughter Eliza, but also her younger sister, Charlotte de Grouchy. Madame de Condorcet was obliged to open a shop to survive, and put aside her writing and translation work. After the end of the Jacobin Terror a few months later in second year of Thermidor (July 1794), de Condorcet published a translation of Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) in 1798, adding eight letters, Lettres sur la Sympathie, commenting upon this work. This became the standard French translation for the next two centuries. De Condorcet's eight letters on sympathyhere were however ignored by historians of economic thought, and were just recently translated into English (Brown, 2008). In 1799, de Condorcet also arranged to publish her husband's √âloges des Academiciens, and was finally able to revive her salon at the former home of another salon hostess Madame Helv√©tius at Auteuil (Guillois 1897, pp. 94, 177). De Condorcet worked with her brother-in-law, the philosopher and doctor Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis (who had married her sister Charlotte some time between 1794 and 1800), and with Joseph Garat to publish her husband's complete works in 21 volumes between 1801 and 1804. She adhered to the end to her husband's political views, and under the Consulate and Empire, her salon became a meeting place for those opposed to the autocratic regime. Sophie de Condorcet survived the French Revolution, the Directory, and the era of Napoleon, to witness the revival of reaction under the restored Bourbons. Life during the Napoleonic regime De Condorcet remained active as a salon hostess, and in promoting her late husband's political views. Sophie de Condorcet died in Paris on 8 September 1822. Even at the end, she was determined to preserve Condorcet's memory through his works, and was preparing to bring out a new edition. Eliza Condorcet-O'Connor The de Condorcets had one daughter Alexandrine Louise Sophie de Caritat de Condorcet (b 1790/1-1859), who was called Eliza (or Liza, or Elisa) for short. She survived to marry on 4 July 1807 an exiled Irish revolutionary, Arthur O'Connor (1763/5-1852, born in Mitchelstown, in County Cork). At 44 (more than twice her age), he was almost as old as Eliza's mother.Clifford D. Conner.

By strange coincidence Eliza's maternal uncle Grouchy had commanded the army forces in the abortive invasion of Ireland of 1796‚Äì1797. Eliza and Arthur Condorcet-O'Connor's efforts took over where Eliza's mother had left off, publishing Eliza's father's works in twelve volumes in 1847‚Äì1849. Eliza (or Elisa) and Arthur had five children, including three sons, all of whom died before their father in 1852. Only one son Daniel (1810‚Äì1851) married and left posterity \\"The O'Connor-Condorcet couple had five children, only one of whom, Daniel O'Connor, left a posterity: two sons, including General Arthur O'Connor, who married Marguerite Elizabeth de Ganay in 1878. From this union, two daughters were born: the first, Elizabeth O'Connor, married Alexandre de La Taulotte; the second, Brigitte O'Connor, to Count Fran√ßois de La Tour du Pin who gave her three children: Philis, Aymar and Fran√ßois de La Tour du Pin.\\" Children of Arthur O'Connor and Elisa de Condorcet: * Daniel O'Connor (1810‚Äì1851) He married 1843 Ernestine Duval du Fraville (1820‚Äì1877, who died at CannesNEWS BY THE SAN FRANCISCO MAIL.

It was formed using surplus ground crew of the Luftwaffe and served on the Eastern Front from late 1942 to June 1944 when it was destroyed during Operation Bagration. Operational history The 6th Luftwaffe Field Division, one of several such divisions of the Luftwaffe (German Air Force), was formed in September 1942 in Gross-Born Troop Maneuver Area, under the command of Oberst Ernst Weber. Intended to serve as infantry, its personnel were largely drawn from surplus Luftwaffe ground crew. In November 1942, it was assigned to the 3rd Panzer Army in Army Group Centre on the Eastern Front and posted to a sector near Nevel. Here it defended against Soviet operations in the area. In November 1943, responsibility for the division was transferred to the Army and it was renamed the 6th Field Division (L). Shortly afterwards, its Field Jager battalions became the 52nd, 53rd and 54th Jager regiments while its original artillery, tank destroyer and flak battalions was integrated into a new 6th Artillery Regiment. In the summer of 1944, the 6th Field Division held an area to the east of Vitebsk as part of LIII Corps of the 3rd Panzer Army. The division was encircled during the Vitebsk‚ÄìOrsha Offensive at Vitebsk within days of the start of the Soviet Army's Operation Bagration on 22 June 1944.

Such activity has existed since the early 19th century in the United States and was gradually prohibited in all states. It continues as an underground activity in both rural and urban locations. In the late 20th century, police and animal control law enforcement task forces of primarily local and state authorities were formed in many parts of the country to combat dog fighting rings to combat serious animal welfare violations with links to organized crime and social problems. In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed a federal law against interstate dog-fighting activities, providing for felony-level penalties including multi-year prison sentences and large fines for each offense; passage of this law was followed by the involvement of the Inspector General's Office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in ongoing investigations around the country. In April 2007, the illegal activity received widespread attention after evidence surfaced suggesting professional football player Michael Vick had a dog-fighting ring operating on his property. The case resulted in guilty pleas by several individuals and to a single felony count for Vick, who received a 21-month federal sentence. In 2009, Ed Faron was sentenced for six months for running the largest-known dog-fighting ring in the United States, called Wildside Kennels. History in U.S. ‚ÄúA Dog Fight at Kit Burns' ‚Äù, 1868. According to a study by the Michigan State University College of Law published in 2005, in the United States, dog fighting was once completely legal and was sanctioned and promoted during the colonial period (17th century through 1776) and continuing through the Victorian era in the late 19th century. The early 19th century saw the development in England of the Bull-and-Terrier, first imported into the United States ca. 1817, becoming the foundation stock of the later American Pit Bull Terrier. Organized dog fighting became a part of American culture, and was promoted by the United Kennel Club.Mike Homan, The Complete History of Fighting Dogs (Ringpress Books, 1999) As the activity grew in popularity, so too did opposition to it. By the early 20th century the United Kennel Club dropped its support and by the 1960s most states had made it illegal. It was not until 1976 that it was outlawed in all states and even then, enforcement was generally lax. By the late 20th century, as dog fighting became more popular in the poor areas of major U.S. cities, research and investigations revealed strong links with connected with street gangs and social ills, enforcement efforts increased. Despite legality issues, dogs are still commonly used for fighting purposes all across the continent. The American Pit Bull Terrier is the most popular breed used for fighting, but foreign breeds, such as the Dogo Argentino (used widely in South America), and to a lesser extent, the Presa Canario are also gaining popularity. In Miami- Dade County, Florida, where the APBT, American Staffordshire Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier (or any other dog that substantially conforms to any of these breeds' characteristics) is banned, the Dogo Argentino has become the main fighting dog of choice, being used at both organized and street level dogfighting. Impacts upon modern society In the 21st century, dog fighting has become an objectionable and unlawful activity in most places broad categories, and each have motivated constituencies in many areas. =Animal welfare and rights= Dog fighting is often considered one of the most serious forms of animal abuse, not only for the violence that the dogs endure during and after the fights, but because they often suffer their entire lives. This is intentional, as many participants believe the rough treatment of the dogs will make them better, more aggressive fighters. This position and the resulting treatment afforded the dogs stand in stark contrast with prevailing public values regarding the treatment of dogs in many civilized societies. In addition to the controversial treatment a dog receives when he has potential as a fighter, according to a filing in U.S. District Court in Richmond by Federal investigators in Virginia, which was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and published by the Baltimore Sun on July 6, 2007, a losing dog or one whose potential is considered unacceptable faces \\"being put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method\\". During the furor arising around the Bad Newz Kennels investigation in Virginia in 2007 and revelations of extreme brutality there, even such diverse notables as hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons and the Reverend Al Sharpton joined with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in calling for strong stands against animal cruelty, jointly stating: =Stolen pets: bait animals= In addition to the fate which awaits fighters or even dogs likely to become fighters, often \\"bait\\" animals are used to test a dog's fighting instinct. With the use of \\"Adoption Wanted\\" or \\"Good Home Needed\\" posters to track their bait which is used in the training for these \\"fighters\\". The bait is mauled or killed in the process. Often bait animals are stolen pets, as officials with the Sheriff's Department in Pima County, Arizona say they were shocked to discover a few years ago, according to a story by National Geographic News. According to news reports compiled by the National Humane Society, the snouts of bait dogs are wrapped with duct tape to prevent them from injuring dogs being trained for fighting. Some bait animals have been recovered with their teeth ground down to the gums to render them helpless against fighting dogs. Other animals, such as cats and rabbits are also reported to be used as bait for fighting dogs. Experts have said small dogs, kittens, and rabbits are more at risk of being stolen for bait than larger animals. National Geographic noted that there are no statistics on how many pets are taken and used as bait by dog fighting rings each year. Patricia Wagner, head of the National Illegal Animal Fighting Task Force for the Humane Society of the United States, offered the statement \\"I think every state has a problem with it, whether they know it or not.\\" =Dangers of training dogs for fighting= After a life of training as a fighting dog, if a dog does not suffer its death while in such service, it is often euthanized. In Richmond, Virginia, when a dog fighter was sentenced in June 2007, it was revealed in court that over a dozen of his dogs had to be euthanized, either because of serious illness, injury or malnutrition, or because their training as fighting dogs made them too dangerous for adoption. Until 2006, the man had kept 16 pit bulls in the backyard of his house, confined with heavy chains used for automobile towing. Experts say chaining the animals is a dogfighting technique for building strength. When an animal control officer arrived in response to a complaint from a neighbor that one of the dogs had died, he found the dead dog in a trash can. The others had no food, no clean water and no adequate shelter. Jody Jones, program manager of Richmond Animal Care and Control, said in court that the case produced more dogs euthanized than any other case she knows of from her 15-year career in animal control. Following the seizure of a large number of dogs in an April 2007 dog fighting case in Mississippi, Tara High, executive director of the Humane Society of South Mississippi said \\"The reality is that they've been used for entertainment. It's quite tragic for those of us that are kind of left to deal with it and the reality that these animals aren't going to be able to be rehabilitated,\\" she said. Ms. High compared the animals to \\"a loaded weapon. And not something we feel very comfortable letting out into the community.\\" =Societal impact, gang, and criminal activities= For many years, even after it was outlawed, dog fighting was considered an isolated animal welfare issue, and as such was ignored, denied, or disregarded by law enforcement agencies. However, it has now been established that the dog fighting culture is often intimately connected to other criminal activity, with dog fighters frequently involved in organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, or gangs, and dog fighting events often facilitating gambling and drug trafficking. According to the aforementioned Michigan State study, Laws in U.S. Dog fighting is unlawful in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Before the Federal law was passed, New York already had issued felony penalties up to four years to individuals fighting any types of animals, but some other levels of participation were only misdemeanor offenses. The state of New York considers attending an animal fight to be merely a violation, which ultimately leads to a fine. States surrounding New York like New Jersey and Connecticut passed a bill, stated that attendance at an animal fight is indeed a felony charge. Due to a loophole it is legal in 49 out of 50 states to possess dogs for fighting. The Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act closed the loophole that allowed people to knowingly attend dogfighting events. In all states, it is against the law (and often a felony) even to attend a dog fighting event, regardless of direct participation. According to authorities, dog fighting is increasingly practiced by gangs, and is linked to other unlawful activities, such as illegal gambling. On February 7, 2014 President Obama signed the Farm Bill which contained the U.S. H.R. 366/S. 666‚ÄîAnimal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act. \\"The final bill includes a provision making it a federal crime to attend or bring a child under the age of 16 to an animal fighting event[.]\\" \\"The Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act would make it a federal offense to knowingly attend an organized animal fight and would impose additional penalties for bringing children to animal fights. Violators would face up to one year in prison for attending a fight, and up to three years in prison for bringing a minor to a fight.\\" =Breed specific legislation= Even though it is illegal, dog fighting still occurs across the globe. To combat dog fighting and curb ownership of \\"dangerous dogs,\\" Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) has been passed in some countries, as well as in some local and regional jurisdictions. However, opponents argue that BSL affects responsible pet owners more than those who keep dogs for fighting purposes. =New Federal law effective May 2007= In May 2007, a new Federal law went into effect making interstate dog fighting activities felonious and providing for imprisonment and imposition of large fines. The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, a new Federal law sponsored by US Senators Arlen Specter (D-PA.), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA.), and John Ensign (R-NV.), was enacted by the U.S. Congress earlier in 2007 and signed by President George W. Bush on May 3, making organizing a dog fight a felony. The law provides a penalty of up to three years of imprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine for each offense of interstate or foreign transport of animals for fighting purposes. Using the provisions of the new law, which took effect immediately, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is pursuing cases in a number of locations around the country with considerable support from humane societies and local police departments. =Widespread links to gangs, other criminal activities= The United States Humane Society estimates that more than 40,000 people across the country buy and sell fighting dogs and are involved in dogfighting activities. But authorities say those in dogfighting circles also are involved in a number of other crimes, including narcotics trafficking, illegal gambling and murder. In August 2006, a suspected dog fighter in Texas bled to death after he was shot by intruders who apparently intended to torture him into revealing where he had hidden $100,000 wagered in a high-stakes dog match. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that an analysis during a study by the College of Law at Michigan State University found that, in more than two dozen raids on dogfights, in virtually every instance police also seized illegal narcotics and weapons. Police seized $250,000 in cash during another 2004 raid in Covington, Georgia. \\"Law enforcement is realizing it's a real community problem, intertwined with other crimes such as drugs and gambling,\\" John Goodwin, an official with the Humane Society stated in an interview for the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot newspaper published in June 2007. Many communities in widespread areas across the United States are aggressively targeting dog fighting by coordinating local and regional dog fighting task forces. \\"It's clear that when you have dogfighting, drugs and gambling and other criminal subcultures follow,\\" according to Mark Plowden, a spokesman for the South Carolina Attorney General's Office, which in 2004 created a dogfighting task force. In Chicago, Illinois, a special police unit is devoted to investigating cases of abuse due to the connection between dog fighting and other gang crimes. In 2005, the police in Los Angeles, California formed an Animal Cruelty Task Force, leading to prosecutions of gang members there for animal abuse. =Professional athletes, entertainers= Among those linked to dog fighting is Doug Atkins an NFL player who was an enthusiastic participator in dog fighting, and LeShon Johnson, a former NFL running back who received a five-year deferred sentence in 2005 after officials seized 200 dogs during a raid of his dog fighting operation that led to 20 people being convicted in Oklahoma. Former National Basketball Association forward Qyntel Woods, pleaded guilty to animal abuse in 2005 at his home in Portland, Oregon. Former Dallas Cowboys lineman Nate Newton was arrested at a dogfight in Texas, although charges were later dropped. In the late 2000s, NFL quarterback Michael Vick was linked to property in southeastern Virginia where authorities believe a multi-state dog fighting operation was based. In an interview with WAVY-TV, Portsmouth, Virginia, Washington Redskins running back Clinton Portis and a teammate, offensive tackle Chris Samuels, defended Vick. Portis said that if Vick is charged and convicted of dog fighting, \\"then you're putting him behind bars for no reason. I don't know if he was fighting dogs or not, but it's his property. It's his dog. If that's what he wants to do, do it.\\" Those comments were sharply criticized by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Redskins and Portis himself later apologized, stating that his controversial remarks about dog fighting were insensitive and that he now realizes he \\"shouldn't have made the comments.\\" He added, \\"At that time I had no idea the love people have for animals, and I didn't consider it when I made those comments.\\" New York Animal Control Officer Kleinfelder says, \\"For pro athletes, it's not about the money ... Instead of boxers just beating up on each other, they want to see it go to the death, and with dogs they can let it go that far. To them, dogs are expendable.\\" Rhonda Evans is a sociologist and associate professor in the department of criminal justice at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette who has published four academic articles on dog fighting. She stated in a story published by the Palm Beach Post that she had found that owners of high-dollar fighting dogs spanned all walks of life and social classes, with a common link of \\"a machismo mentality.\\" Evans said \\"For them, tough dogs are a symbol of manhood... and by winning, the dogs build up their owners' ego. They see it as a valid, legitimate sport that is no worse than boxing or football.\\" Rap and other urban music also seem to glorify dog fighting. Jay-Z shows dogs being prepared for a fight in the uncensored version of his music video, \\"99 Problems\\". A powerful-looking pit bull is on the cover of a CD by rapper DMX that is titled Grand Champ. \\"Grand Champ\\" is said to be a reference to a dog that has won five dogfights. Madison Avenue advertising firms have capitalized on the same theme. When Nike was criticized about an ad featuring a growling pit bull and Rottweiler about to face off, the company denied the ad encourages dog fighting. The representative went on to state, however, \\"People have to understand the youth culture we cater to. Our market is the urban, edgy, hip-hop culture.\\" =Athletes speak out against dog fighting= International Boxing Federation Champion Steve Cunningham: \\"Dogs are truly man's best friend. Yet some people take advantage of their loyalty by forcing them into dog fighting. It's disgusting and a heinous thing to do. It must be stopped. So join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\\" Mixed Martial Arts Champion Tito Ortiz: \\"Animal abuse happens every day in the form of dog fighting. It's cruel, inhumane, and it needs to be stopped. Show your strength and join me, Tito Ortiz, The Huntington Beach Bad Boy, in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\\" Mixed Martial Arts Champion Andrei Arlovski: \\"The pit bull has a long history in America. In the early 1900s the U.S. proudly used pit bulls on WWI posters to symbolize qualities that make up America - friendly, courageous, hard working and worthy of respect. I chose my name because I admire the breed for the same reasons. When I hear about pit bulls being used in dog fighting, it makes me angry. I have a choice to step into the cage to fight, but these dogs have no choice. Dog fighting is morally wrong and inhumane. In my opinion it's torture. Please join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\\" Mixed Martial Arts Champion Cung Le: \\"Dog fighting is cruel and inhumane and those who engage in it are losers. Show your strength and join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\\" Mixed Martial Arts Champion Josh Thomson: \\"Torturing or abusing animals is not cool nor is it a sign of strength. Real fighters stand up for what is right to protect those less able to do so. Show your strength and join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\\" Mixed Martial Arts Champion Rob McCullough: \\"I choose to fight, but a lot of dogs don't get that choice. Knock Out Dog Fighting...cuz dog fighting is not cool.\\" =Increased enforcement, penalty= In recent times, a combination of animal rights groups and law enforcement agencies have drawn new attention to dog fighting and related criminal activities in the United States. A story in the New York Daily News published on June 10, 2007, stated \\"dog fighting is a multi-million-dollar industry that is part of an underground subculture that holds its events in secret locations. It is extremely difficult for authorities to prove who has dogs for fighting purposes.\\" A few weeks later, in Buffalo, New York, police and animal control officers at the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter rescued 15 pit bulls believed to be part of dogfighting activities during a two-week period. Authorities found pit bulls ‚Äî dead and alive ‚Äî as well as \\"dogfighting kits\\", which include harnesses, muzzles, pre-fight training guides, stacks of breeding papers, and even videos on dogfighting. \\"We have been back to the same house three different times, and each time we pull out more and more dogs,\\" said Animal Control Officer Andrew Kleinfelder. \\"Even when someone is arrested, a normal pit bull fighting ring has at least 30 people involved. Someone keeps the fights going.\\" This crackdown has also resulted in longer sentences for dogfighting. In South Carolina, David Tant, breeder of fighting dogs, is serving a 30-year sentence, among the stiffest ever imposed for the crime. Tant, 63, formerly of the Charleston area, pleaded guilty in November 2004 to more than 40 counts of illegally breeding fighting dogs, and one assault count connected to a surveyor who was wounded by a booby trap after he wandered onto Tant's property in southern Charleston County. The surveyor was showered by an explosion of birdshot, injuring him slightly. The device was described as a \\"directional mine\\" meant to ward off intruders. \\"Fat Bill\\" Reynolds of Henry County, Virginia near Martinsville, publisher of American Gamedog Times, a dog fighting magazine with an Internet website, was convicted in 2001 of transmitting images of fighting dogs across state lines and sentenced to 30 months in prison. =Arrests, seizures, and convictions= March 2007, Dayton Ohio In March 2007, a combined Federal, state and local law enforcement team disrupted a large dog fighting network in Dayton, Ohio which was operating in Ohio, Kentucky, and Michigan. The investigation of the operation based in Montgomery County, Ohio had lasted a year. More than two dozen arrests were made and more than 60 dogs were seized. In May, 7 persons in Ohio submitted guilty pleas to state charges. Sentencing was pending at the time of a USDA news release in June 2007. April 2007, Pass Christian, Mississippi On April 24, authorities in Pass Christian, Mississippi raided a large dog fighting training compound owned by Maxwell Landry. According to several news stories on local television station WLOX, 17 persons were arrested and fighting dogs from Louisiana, crack cocaine and several other illicit drugs were found at the scene and confiscated. 44 pit bulls were seized. Landry once lived in Chalmette, Louisiana. After the area was damaged as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, he moved to the Harrison County, Mississippi site, located about north of Interstate 10. Federal agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) discovered the dogs and the training compound during aerial surveillance relating to an investigation of drug trafficking. Members of the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals came to help take care of the dogs. Property owner Landry was one of 14 people named in a Federal drug trafficking indictment involving activity between Mississippi, Louisiana and South Carolina. He faces to 43 counts of illegal dog fighting in Harrison County. John Wesley Black and Constance Jean Courtney could spend a minimum of one year in prison per illegal dog fighting charge, and are linked to two dog fighting allegations. Courtney was employed as a veterinarian's assistant. According to Harrison County Prosecutor Herman Cox, Landry has confessed to investigators that he made about $5,000 a month fighting his dogs against other dogs. April 2007 Surry, Virginia On April 25, 2007, an investigation began in Virginia after evidence of a dog fighting ring turned up during a narcotics search of a home and property owned by Michael Vick, a professional football player with the Atlanta Falcons of the NFL and a dog breeder. The property is located in southeastern Surry County a few miles northwest of the Isle of Wight County town of Smithfield. The original search began following several narcotics arrests of 26-year-old Davon T. Boddie, Vick's cousin and cook, who had given authorities the address of Vick's property at 1915 Moonlight Road, Surry, Virginia as his home address when he was arrested. The investigation eventually involved local, state and Federal authorities. In late April, Vick told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution \\"I'm never at the house‚Ä¶I left the house with my family‚Ä¶They just haven't been doing the right thing‚Ä¶It's unfortunate I have to take the heat behind it. If I'm not there, I don't know what's going on.\\" On July 2, agents of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) filed court documents describing a five-year operation of an interstate dog fighting ring which called itself \\"Bad Newz Kennels\\" and had been based at Vick's property. No one was named individually in the July 2 court papers. WAVY-TV (Portsmouth, Virginia) posted a copy of one of the Federal court document from July 2, and has made it available online. On July 17, Vick and three men described as his employees were indicted by a Federal grand jury for \\"conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in animal fighting venture\\". They faced $350,000 in fines and six years in prison if convicted of the Federal felony and misdemeanor charges. Details in the indictments describing extreme acts of brutality against losing and under-performing dogs included executions by electrocution, hanging, drowning, shooting, and blunt force resulted in widespread public protests and calls for Vick's removal from NFL play pending resolution by a diverse spectrum of notable persons and public officials. On July 23, Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him for an indefinite period pending investigation of possible violations of the league's Personal Conduct Policy. Atlanta Falcons team owner Arthur Blank stated that Vick should give up thoughts of playing until the case is resolved. An arraignment and detention hearing was held on July 26 in U.S. District Court in Richmond. A trial date was set for November 26, and all four defendants were released without bond, but under the direct supervision of the court and under certain conditions. Federal prosecutors stated they would file a superseded indictment in August, which could have included additional charges and/or defendants. According to the Code of Virginia at the time, various violations of the Virginia laws involving dog fighting and cruelty to companion animals Code of Virginia, ¬ß 3.1-796.124 (2003). were considered class 6 felony crimes, each carrying a fine and 1 to 5 years in prison per offense. Over fifty dogs were seized, in addition to carcasses recovered during several searches of Vick's property. On August 24, Vick plead guilty. He joined three others who had also plead guilty earlier to similar charges. The four faced up to five years in prison, fines of up to $250,000 and restitution. Each received sentences ranging from 60 days to 23 months. June 2007 Richmond, Virginia In June 2007, a circuit court judge in Richmond, Virginia imposed a four-year prison sentence and $20,000 in fines on 40-year-old Stacey A. Miller, an Army veteran and convicted dog fighter. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that Miller was convicted in January by a jury of felony dogfighting, two counts of felony animal cruelty, a dozen counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty and two counts of possessing steroids. The jury recommended the four-year sentence and $20,000 in fines that the judge imposed. Miller also was ordered to pay Richmond Animal Care and Control $26,205.29 in restitution for the cost of caring for the 15 American pit bull terriers that were seized from him in February 2006, 12 of which had to be euthanized. July 2007 South Holland, Illinois On July 13, 2007, police in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois rescued 37 fighting dogs from a heavily insulated and ventilated old chicken coop behind a house in the village of South Holland. At a news conference, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart stated that it was \\"the largest seizure of fighting dogs in state history.\\" According to the Chicago Tribune, an investigation began in May after police were informed that fighting dogs were being bred and raised at the home. Two workers for an animal shelter said that they had tipped off police. Officials close to the investigation confirmed their role. Neighbors told the news media that they had also called police to complain about barking from the barn and what was described as \\"a stench\\" by several. One neighbor said that he had called police several months ago after seeing a dog chained in the yard on a hot day without water. Another neighbor who lives across the street told reporters that he began seeing police in unmarked cars watching the home several weeks earlier, and one investigator had interviewed him about a week before the raid. The Tribune reported that the neighbor said that he told the investigator \\"...the place was like a gas station, people coming and going constantly at night...I thought maybe he was dealing drugs.\\" Executing a warrant, a team formed by the Cook County sheriff's police special operations unit, Cook County animal control, and the South Holland Police Department entered the property and the soundproofed barn, seizing the dogs and evidence. They also found a boa constrictor snake and a substance suspected of being crack cocaine inside of the home, according to a WLS-TV (Chicago) news report. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that the site had \\"all the makings of a sophisticated and professional dog fighting operation.\\" It was noted that treadmills and weights were nearby for building strength, while a female dog was kept in a separate room where breeding was done. Drugs used to make them stronger and fight harder were also found. One of the dogs, larger than the pit bulls and described as \\"urine-soaked\\" with its hair falling out, was thought to be a \\"bait dog\\" used in training others. WBBM radio news reported that the dogs seized in the raid ranged from weeks-old puppies to older dogs, some of whom suffered from physical injuries. Officers wore industrial masks Friday as they rescued the dogs, which were kept in pet transport carriers in the barn and positioned in a way that restricted sunlight. Several of the carriers had bite marks around their openings. Dart described the conditions inside the barn as horrible. \\"It's very difficult to breathe inside,\\" he said. \\"The smell is overwhelming, and the conditions are deplorable.\\" Sheriff Dart said it was clear that the 29-year-old homeowner was an active ringleader on the dog-fighting circuit, breeding fighting dogs while renting out others for matches and raking in hundreds of dollars each time. Kevin Taylor was known to authorities. He has two prior convictions related to dog fighting, including cruelty to animals. He was convicted On June 15, 2007 in Livingston County after being arrested for attending dog fights near Pontiac in September 2005. According to news reports, a Livingston County jury convicted Taylor on a Class C misdemeanor charge. He paid a fine of $1,275 and spent six days in jail, a total that counts his initial arrest and subsequent arrests on bench warrants after he failed to show for court dates. On July 14, Taylor was charged with 37 misdemeanor counts of cruelty to animals, a felony count of possession of a controlled substance, a felony count of dog-fighting and two other misdemeanor charges, one count each of possession of dogs by a felon and owning sport fighting dogs. Sheriff Dart said that although Taylor is thought to have bred and trained the dogs to sell or rent there, evidence did not indicate that any dogfights took place at the South Holland location. On July 16, Cook County Circuit Judge Camille Willis set Taylor's bond at $100,000. U.S. Senators speak out On July 19, 2007, U.S. Senator Robert Byrd, 89, of West Virginia, a well-known dog lover, gave a passionate speech in the U.S. Congress about the practice of dog fighting in response to the indictment of football player Michael Vick. Senator Sadaf stated: The following day, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said he had sent a letter to the NFL commissioner calling for Vick's immediate suspension. Kerry wrote to Commissioner Roger Goodell: Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, also said he planned to introduce anti-dogfighting legislation. According to his office, Senator Kerry's proposal would make it illegal to transmit images of dogfighting, to run Web sites that cater to dogfighting, and to own or train dogs for the purpose of fighting under Federal laws.

Life Panofka studied classical philology at Berlin University from 1819. In 1823 he travelled to Rome and a year later ‚Äì along with the painter Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (1787‚Äì1837), the art writer and collector August Kestner and the classical art historian Eduard Gerhard ‚Äì founded the \\"Hyperboreans\\" (Hyperboreisch-r√∂mische Gesellschaft), a group of northern European scholars who studied classical ruins in Rome. In Rome, Panofka's intelligence drew attention and patronage from the Duc de Blacas (1770‚Äì1839), the French ambassador to the Papal States, and a collector of antiquities, with whom Panofka remained upon the duke's 1828 return to Paris. When in 1829 the \\"Hyperboreans\\" metamorphosed into the Instituto di Corrispondenza Archaeologica, Panofka was named the new organisation's secretary for its members in Paris. Panofka travelled to southern Italy, where he became involved in the antiquities collection of the Museo Nazionale in Naples, in particular cataloguing its vases of the museum. (At the same time, Gerhard was cataloguing the classical sculpture.) On his subsequent return to Paris, Panofka published these researches on Greek pottery as Recherches sur les v√©ritables noms des vases grecs (Researches on the true names of Greek vases). However, by 1836, he had moved to work at the Royal Museum in Berlin, where his knowledge of classical vases eventually led to his being appointed curator of the vase collection. Despite his growing deafness, and his becoming less and less able to support himself on the museum's wages, Panofka managed to publish Terracotten des k√∂niglichen Museums zu Berlin (Terracottas of the Royal Museum in Berlin) in 1842, and a philological study of the figure of the African in the cult of Delphi in 1849. The latter was ahead of its time, in that nobody had yet realised the relation of Delphi with Egypt.Metrum.org He had become Professor of Archaeology at Berlin University in 1844 and in 1856, two years before his death, became Conservator of the Museum's vases collection (Vasensammlung).

Origins As a Greek name, Spiro may also be spelled Spyro. It comes from the Greek Spiros/Spyros/Speros (), with a nominative final \\"s\\" that is usually dropped when Anglicised. It is a male given name fairly common in Greek- speaking population (Greece especially in Corfu whose patron saint is Saint Spyridon, in Cyprus, Greek diaspora) as well as among the Christians of Lebanon where it is a common first and last name. It is a shortened form of the archaic-sounding Spyridon (Œ£œÄœÖœÅŒØŒ¥œâŒΩ), which means in ancient Greek \\"basket used to carry seeds\\" (Œ£œÄœÖœÅŒØ, grain, seed).

A former amateur champion, he made his professional debut in 1999. His highest rank was maegashira 11, which he reached in 2002. He was mostly ranked in the makushita and sandanme divisions from 2005 until his retirement in 2012. He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association upon his retirement and was the head coach of Kasugayama stable from 2012 until 2016. Career Takahama practised amateur sumo at Nihon University and joined the professional sport in March 1999. He made his debut alongside Kotomitsuki and Takamisakari.Sumo Fan Magazine He began wrestling under his own name but upon promotion to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in July 2000 he adopted the shikona or fighting name of Hamanishiki. After five tournaments in j≈´ry≈ç he made his debut in the top makuuchi division in May 2001. However he was unable to progress higher than the lower maegashira ranks and fell back to the second division in September 2002. In November 2004, ranked at the very bottom of j≈´ry≈ç, he produced a disastrous 1-14 record and was demoted to the third makushita division, where he had begun his career. He reverted to his own surname in November 2005 but this did little to change his fortunes. He missed two tournaments through injury in November 2006 and January 2007 and was demoted once more, to the fourth sandanme division. He managed to return to the makushita division after a good 6-1 performance in January 2008, and he followed up with a 5-2 score in March and 4-3 in May, which took him to makushita 26 for the July 2008 tournament, his highest rank since September 2006, before his injury. He returned to the Hamanishiki name in July 2009. In May 2011 he earned promotion back to the j≈´ry≈ç division for the first time in over six years after scoring 6-1 at makushita 10. There were a large number of positions available in j≈´ry≈ç due to the forced retirements of several wrestlers after a match-fixing scandal. The 39 tournaments it took him to return to j≈´ry≈ç is the most in sumo history. His stay in j≈´ry≈ç lasted only two tournaments however, as he could score only 5-10 in July and 2-13 in September. Retirement from sumo ringside judge in May 2016 He retired in February 2012 and took charge of the Kasugayama stable as the previous head, former maegashira Kasugafuji, concentrated on his role as a director of the Sumo Association's board. After a legal dispute with the former Kasugafuji, who subsequently left the Sumo Association and claimed rent had not been paid to him, Hamanishiki moved the stable to a new location in Kawasaki city. Continuing legal disputes with the former head of the stable meant that he had not been given the official certificate granting him ownership of the Kasugayama elder stock, and thus was not qualified to be a stablemaster. In October 2016 the Sumo Association ordered him to resign as stablemaster, and move his wrestlers to Oitekaze stable. He left the Sumo Association altogether in January 2017, having failed to meet their deadline to come to an agreement with his predecessor. Fighting style Hamanishiki was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, who preferred grappling techniques to pushing or thrusting. His most common winning kimarite was a straightforward yori-kiri or force out.

It stars Ferdy Mayne, Luca Bercovici, Jennifer Starrett, Nita Talbot and Barbara Pilavin, along with Jeffrey Combs in his horror film acting debut. The film's plot follows a group of drama students who decide to kidnap the corpse of a recently deceased horror movie star. By disrupting his tomb, they unwittingly release an ancient black magic that begins consuming them one by one. The film was distributed by Saturn International, and has been released on home media by Troma Entertainment and Vinegar Syndrome, among other companies. Plot A group of drama students idolize their favorite horror film star, Conrad Razkoff. In the beginning, Conrad is acting in a commercial for dentures, and the Director stops the filming because he does not like Conrad's performance. While the director sits on the edge of the balcony, an angry Conrad pushes him off with his cane. Later, Conrad visits a school and talks about his performances, only to faint under excitement. One of the drama students, Meg, revives him. Later, as Conrad sits in his bed, his obese director Wolfgang visits him. After a long talk about his death arrangements, Conrad closes his eyes and tricks the director into believing he is dead. Then, the director denounces him until Conrad springs up and smothers him with a pillow. After Conrad dies, the seven drama students, Meg, Saint, Bobo, Eve, Donna, Oscar, and Stu, go to the cemetery after dark, they sneak into the tomb where Conrad's coffin resides. The lights turn on and they see a film of Conrad stating that he welcomes them into his tomb, unless, he says, they have broken in. Creeped out, Meg asks them not to take Conrad, but they do, and take him to an old mansion where they stay for the night. That night, Conrad's coffin explodes, and he rises from the dead. Later, Oscar and Donna are having sex but Donna says she is scared. Oscar goes to investigate and has his tongue ripped out by Conrad in the attic. Donna becomes worried and walks outside only to see Conrad, who uses black magic to set her on fire. Later, the five remaining teens realize that Oscar and Donna are missing and begin to look for them. Bob however is put in a trance by Conrad and walks to Conrad's tomb, only to suffocate from vapors that are released inside the crypt. Eve decides to watch a movie and is lured out of her room by the sound of Donna's voice, only to be smashed into the wall by Conrad's coffin, and hidden with Oscar's body. Meg, Saint, and Stu realize that the other two are now missing and begin to panic, and Meg decides she's going to tell the police. Stu runs upstairs to get a flashlight since Saint's car will not start, only to be decapitated by Conrad who then sends his severed head out onto the front lawn of the mansion. Meg and Saint venture outside looking for Stu and find Donna's burnt body, and hurry back inside. Saint decides to try to fix his car, while Conrad traps Meg in the attic, where she impales him with a cross. Saint safely hides her unconscious body and takes Conrad's body with him to put back in the crypt, while the police arrive to the mansion finding a delirious Meg and all her dead friends. At the cemetery, Conrad attacks Saint and puts him in the crematorium, and goes back to his grave. A while later, his wife and his psychic friend arrive to say their final goodbyes to the \\"dead\\" Conrad, only Conrad kills his psychic after she steals his jewelry from his body, and his wife locks the crypt for forever. The final scene shows a video being played on the television installed in the crypt of Conrad informing the audience that hell is actually quite pleasant and hopes that more respect will be shown for the dead. Cast Production Some of the horror movie memorabilia seen in the film was provided by Forrest J Ackerman. Release Several sources list the film's release year as 1981, including home video distributor Vinegar Syndrome. Other sources list the release year as 1982, and still others list it as 1983. Critical reception A contemporary review in Variety called Frightmare a \\"misguided horror spoof.\\" Bill Gibron of DVD Talk referred to it as \\"a monotonous mess, made even less memorable by its lack of anything closely resembling a movie ‚Äì like characters, plot or purpose.\\" He concluded that the film is \\"far too slow and somber for a modern macabre audience, and its supposedly ingenious premise pales in comparison to those that would later really fidget with the scary movie dynamic.\\" However, in his book The Essential Monster Movie Guide, writer Stephen Jones called the film an \\"enjoyable low-budget horror thriller.\\" Meagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the film \\"has some pretty great death sequences\\", and called it \\"80s slashers meets Gothic horror, but full on weird.\\" Home media Frightmare was released on VHS by Vestron Video. In May 2005, it was released on DVD by Troma Entertainment. On October 20, 2015, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Vinegar Syndrome and later by UK distributors 88 Films.

Professional hypnotist Hugh Lennon discovered Oscar, a 10-month-old black Labrador Retriever puppy, on a farm in Yorkshire. Lennon states that initially he bought Oscar as a pet and brought him to shows for companionship, but \\"one night I brought him on stage with me. He started staring at this girl and she fell into hypnosis, without me doing a thing\\". Lennon maintains that a number of dogs and other carnivores have a natural ability to hypnotise prey. In 1995, Oscar made headlines in the UK and all over the world, when he went missing while appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe in Scotland. Oscar is also familiar to many students of English as a second language, as materials about Oscar and his act are featured in the Oxford University Press English language course. In 2001, after 12 years performing, Oscar's eyesight failed and he was no longer able to hold the penetrating stare necessary for stage hypnosis. Open auditions were held at the Weymouth Pavilion for a replacement dog; the eventual replacement chosen was Milo, a three-year-old German Shepherd-Rottweiler crossbreed. However, Lennon later worked with Murphy, one of Oscar's sons. Lennon and the Hypnodog have appeared on numerous television and radio shows, including This Morning and Kelly, and at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The show was taken over in 2014 by Hugh's niece Krystyna Lennon and her dog Princess after his retirement in 2007. The duo are based in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

They served as business premises, landing stages for steam packet riverboats and as Second World War air-raid shelters. They were accessed from wooden staircases that descended from Victoria Street. Regular flooding resulted in the closure of the steam-packet services in the early 20th century, and the arches were later used for general storage. Following the outbreak of the Second World War they were converted into air-raid shelters. They are now bricked up and inaccessible, the staircases having been removed in the latter part of the 20th century. History =Background= The arches were built to create new industrial space, during construction of a new embankment along the River Irwell, built to support a new road. The embankment was completed in 1838. In 1852 the life-boat Challenger was built and launched from the Arches. Victorian-era passenger trips along the Irwell were very popular, despite increasing levels of river pollution; in 1860 the Irwell was described as \\"almost proverbial for the foulness of its waters; receiving the refuse of cotton factories, coal mines, print works, bleach works, dye works, chemical works, paper works, almost every kind of industry.\\" The Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876 was designed to solve such problems, although it was largely ineffective. However, it laid the groundwork for the more draconian legislation that followed. =Packets= The Cathedral Landing Stage in the 19th century The Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894, and by 1895 the Ship Canal Company, who encouraged passenger traffic, had opened at least one landing stage. Two of its steamers, Shandon and Eagle, are known to have used the landing stages. These boats could carry 900 and 1,100 passengers respectively. During the first half of 1897 more than 200,000 passengers were carried on trips around Manchester Docks, with holiday seasons the most popular periods. Competition for passengers was fierce, with at least two landing stages being operated by different companies. The ferries would occasionally carry musicians, for passenger entertainment. The landing stages suffered problems with flooding of the Irwell and do not appear to have remained in business for long, being closed in 1906. In Underground Manchester; secrets of the city revealed, author Keith Warrender quotes the recollections of a Manchester City News writer, originally published in 1923: He continues, quoting another letter from the Manchester Evening News in 1960 which says; =Second World War= Victoria Bridge During the Second World War the arches and tunnels surrounding them were converted into air-raid shelters. The conversion took three months and with additional brick blast walls added, cost ¬£10,150, providing shelter for 1,619 people. The cobbled surfaces shown in some of the pictures on the Manchester City Council website show the same network of tunnels before their conversion to air raid shelters. The land covered by the arches included a street, which led at the west end to a wooden bridge over the River Irk. The old road was covered over in an improvement scheme that began in 1833. The steps and landing stages have been closed to the public for many years. In 1935 less elaborate steps were in place, some of which remained until 1971. Photographs taken in 1972 show the arches to be barred, some are covered with metal grilles. As of 2009 none of the steps remain, and the original Victorian railings along the embankment have been replaced with a stone wall and new railings. =Connections= The stages also connected with public toilets that used to be in front of the cathedral. While now disused and closed to the public in 1967, Manchester Central Library maps demonstrate their proximity to the landing stages on the river, and both stage and toilets are accessible from one another. Explorers have accessed the landing stages and documented their current condition, including taking photographs. There was an underground entrance to the stages from the premises of Thomas Cook & Son, which stood on the corner of Victoria Bridge. Evidence of the building was reportedly found inside one of the stages in the form of fire-damaged timber purlins, albeit in very poor condition. It has been suggested that the landing stages might be reopened to the public as a tourist attraction. The arches are visible from the three surrounding bridges, and from the northwest shore of the river. They are all bricked up, some with small ventilation apertures left in place.

The exact date of its extinction is not known; it is likely that it was gradually interbred with other breeds, particularly the modern Beagle, until the genuine North Country Beagle bloodline ceased to exist. The origins of the North Country Beagle are equally unclear. Most writers suggest that it was developed from the Talbot, whose origins are also uncertain, but which some have claimed originated in Normandy. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep- throated, scent hound. At some point the Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed, but they remained comparatively slow dogs that relied more on their nose than speed in the chase.Smith p.209 The North Country Beagle was a large, bony hound with a square head, and long trailing ears. Chiefly bred in Yorkshire, it was common in the north of England, but below the River Trent the similar Southern Hound was more abundant. The North Country Beagle was a faster dog; in The British Encyclopedia of 1809, William Nicholson says that the North Country Beagle was kept by the \\"dashing class of sportsman\\" because it could \\"run down a brace [of hare] before dinner\\", but although a good scent hound, was probably lacking in this ability when compared to the delicate nose of the Southern Hound. The writer and poet Gervase Markham, who wrote a number of books on animal husbandry in the early 17th century described the North Country Beagle as having: In his The Dog, in Health and Disease in 1859, \\"Stonehenge\\" (the pen name of John Henry Walsh, later editor of The Field) says the two breeds could be differentiated by the large dewlap possessed by the Southern Hound. The Southern Hound seems to have also had a deeper more melodious voice; Markham says the North Country Beagle had \\"only a little shrill sweetness\\" and lacked depth of tone. How far the Talbot, Northern Hound and Southern Hound were intermixed by the 19th century is impossible to ascertain: while acknowledging that they had once existed as separate breeds, Stonehenge had never seen pure-bred varieties and classified the three breeds together. Both the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound seem to have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for less time-consuming hunts led to the development of the faster Foxhound. The North Country Beagle may have formed part of the packs kept by southern farmers for rabbit-hunting that would eventually become the nucleus for the modern Beagle breed. Stonehenge says that packs of hounds that resembled the description of the North Country Beagle still existed in Wales, Devon, Yorkshire and Sussex during the 19th century, but he was doubtful as to how far any of these packs truly represented any of the three early hound breeds. Aside from the Beagle other modern hound breeds are believed to have North Country Beagle blood: Harriers and Foxhounds among others. Coonhounds and Bloodhounds are likely to have had more influence from the Southern Hound and Talbot lines, as they are excellent trackers but not as swift as other hound breeds.

In 2011 Woolpit parish had a population of 1,995. It is notable for the 12th-century legend of the green children of Woolpit and for its parish church, which has especially fine medieval woodwork. Administratively Woolpit is a civil parish, part of the district of Mid Suffolk. History The village's name, first recorded in the 10th century as Wlpit and later as Wlfpeta, derives from the Old English wulf- pytt, meaning \\"pit for trapping wolves\\". Before the Norman conquest of England, the village belonged to Ulfcytel Snillingr. Between 1174 and 1180, Walter de Coutances, a confidant of King Henry II, was appointed to Woolpit. After his \\"death or retirement\\" it was to be granted to the monks of Bury St Edmunds Abbey. A bull of Pope Alexander III likewise confirms that revenues from Woolpit are to be given to the abbey. In the 15th century and for some time afterward, two fairs were held annually. The Horse Fair was held on two closes, or fields, on 16 September. The Cow Fair was held on its own field on 19 September; here toys as well as cattle were sold. Sir Robert Gardiner, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, was Lord of the Manor from 1597 to 1620. He founded an almshouse for the care of the poor women of Woolpit and nearby Elmswell. The Gardiner charity still exists. Woolpit passed at his death to his grandnephew, Gardiner Webb, who died in 1674. From the 17th century, the area became an important manufacturing centre for \\"Suffolk White\\" bricks, but today only the pits remain. Woolpit is in the hundred of Thedwestry, southeast of Bury. The area of the parish is ; the population in 1831 was 880, less than half agricultural. Mill Lane marks the site of a post mill which was demolished in about 1924. Another mill, which fell down in 1963, stood in Windmill Avenue. The village contains two pubs, The Bull and The Swan, two tea rooms, estate agents, a grocers, hairdressers, fish and chip shop, Palmers Bakery, a dentist and Woolpit Interiors within the village and two industrial estates containing more larger businesses as well as a health surgery and school. Demographics In 1811, Woolpit had 625 inhabitants in 108 houses. By 1821 the population had increased to 801 inhabitants in 116 houses. Legend of the Green Children Village sign depicting the two green children, erected in 1977 The medieval writers Ralph of Coggeshall and William of Newburgh report that two children appeared mysteriously in Woolpit some time during the 12th century. The brother and sister were of generally normal appearance except for the green colour of their skin. They wore strange- looking clothes, spoke in an unknown language, and the only food they would eat was raw beans. Eventually they learned to eat other food and lost their green pallor, but the boy was sickly and died soon after the children were baptised. The girl adjusted to her new life, but she was considered to be \\"rather loose and wanton in her conduct\\". After learning to speak English she explained that she and her brother had come from , an underground world whose inhabitants are green. Some researchers believe that the story of the green children is a typical folk tale, describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of another world, perhaps one beneath our feet or even extraterrestrial. Others consider it to be a garbled account of an historical event, perhaps connected with the persecution of Flemish immigrants living in the area at that time. Local author and folk singer Bob Roberts stated in his 1978 book A Slice of Suffolk that, \\"I was told there are still people in Woolpit who are 'descended from the green children', but nobody would tell me who they were!\\" St Mary's Church St Mary's Church, Woolpit The Grade I listed church has \\"Suffolk's most perfectly restored angel hammerbeam roof\\",Suffolk Churches a profusion of medieval carved pew-ends (mixed with good 19th-century recreations), and a large and very fine porch of 1430‚Äì55. The roof is actually a double hammerbeam example, with the upper beam being false. The tower and spire are by Richard Phipson in the 1850s, replacing the originals lost to lightning in 1852 or 1853. Most of the rest of the church is Perpendicular, except for the 14th-century south aisle and chancel. There is fine flushwork decoration on the exterior of the clerestory. The medieval shrine was at the east end of the south aisle.Norwich; Jenkins; Suffolk Churches The \\"quite perfect\\" eagle lectern is a rare early-Tudor original from before the English Reformation.Jenkins, Suffolk Churches Our Lady of Woolpit Until the Reformation the church housed a richly adorned statue of the Virgin Mary known as \\"Our Lady of Woolpit\\", which was an object of veneration and pilgrimage, perhaps as early as about 1211. There is a clear indication of the existence of an image of the Virgin in a mid-15th century will that speaks of \\"tabernaculum beate Mariae de novo faciendo\\" (\\"in making new/anew the tabernacle of Blessed Mary\\"), which sounds at least like a canopy or even a chapel for housing an image.Nicholas Pevsner, Suffolk, Harmondsworth, 1961, p. 503 It stood in its own chapel within the church. No trace of the chapel survives, but it may have been situated at the east end of the south aisle, or more probably on the north side of the chancel in the area now occupied by the 19th-century vestry. Pilgrimage to Our Lady of Woolpit seems to have been particularly popular in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and the shrine was visited twice by King Henry VI, in 1448 and 1449. In 1481 John, Lord Howard (from 1483 created Duke of Norfolk by Richard III), left a massive ¬£7 9s as an offering for the shrine.John Ashdown-Hill Suffolk Connections of the House of York, in Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archeology and History 41 (2006) part 2, p. 203 After the Tudor dynasty had consolidated its hold on the English throne, Henry VII's queen, Elizabeth of York, made a donation in 1502 of 20d to the shrine.John Ashdown-Hill Suffolk Connections of the House of York, in Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archeology and History 41 (2006) part 2, p. 203 The statue was removed or destroyed after 1538, when Henry VIII ordered the taking down of \\"feigned images abused with Pilgrimages and Offerings\\" throughout England; the chapel was demolished in 1551, on a warrant from the Court of Augmentations. The Lady's Well The Lady's Well of Woolpit In a field about 300 yards north-east of the church there is a small irregular moated enclosure of unknown date, largely covered by trees and bushes and now a nature reserve. The moat is partially filled by water rising from a natural spring, protected by modern brickwork, on the south side; the moated site and the spring constitute a scheduled ancient monument. The spring is known as the Lady's Well or Lady Well. Although there are earlier references to a well or spring, it is first named as \\"Our Ladys Well\\" in a document dated between 1573 and 1576, referring to a manorial court meeting in 1557‚Äì58. The name suggests that it was once a holy well dedicated like the church and statue to the Virgin Mary, and it has been suggested that the well itself was a place of medieval pilgrimage. There is no evidence to suggest that there was ever a building at the site of the well, or even to support the claim of its being a specific goal of pilgrimage. In fact the well was on land held not by the parish church but by the chapel of St John at Palgrave. At some unknown point, a local tradition arose that the waters of the spring had healing properties. A writer in 1827 described the Lady's Well as > a perpetual spring about two feet deep of beautifully clear water, and so > cold that a hand immersed in it is very soon benumbed. It is used > occasionally for the immersion of weakly children, and much resorted to by > persons of weak eyes. Analysis of the water in the 1970s showed that it has a high sulphate content, which may have been of some benefit in the treatment of eye infections.

Her claim was accepted by Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, but by few others.Lovell, James Blair, Anastasia: the Lost Princess, Regnery Gateway, 1991, pp. 443-445 The Russian Imperial family was killed by Bolsheviks in Ekaterinburg, Russia, on July 17, 1918. After the reported murders, a number of people claimed to be surviving members of the family. Early life De Graaff was the daughter of Lena Kroon and Leendert Johannes Hemmes, a man who claimed to be able to use his psychic powers to diagnose sickness from the urine of people with illnesses. De Graaff married twice and had one child from her marriage to Antoon Weelden, whom she divorced, and twin daughters from her marriage to Jan Barend de Graaff.Lovell, pp. 422-424 The story De Graaff, who later called herself \\"Princess Alexandra,\\" claimed that she had actually been born in 1903, the year that Tsarina Alexandra experienced either a \\"hysterical pregnancy\\" or a miscarriage. According to letters and diary entries by the family that were later published, Alexandra did not give birth to a child in 1903.Massie, Robert K., Nicholas and Alexandra, 1968 However, de Graaff claimed that because Nicholas and Alexandra already had four daughters and there was pressure upon them to produce a male heir to the throne, they decided to place their supposed fifth daughter with adoptive parents. Philippe Vachot, a doctor and \\"holy man\\" at the Imperial court from Lyon, France, supposedly arranged for the baby to go to Hemmes.Lovell, p. 424 De Graaff's claims are seen as plausible by some because Vachot was supposedly hired by the Romanovs at a time when they were desperate for a male heir, pursuant to his claims to be able to influence the sex of children at an early stage of pregnancy. Accordingly, when the fifth girl, later to become de Graaff, was supposedly born on September 1, 1903, Vachot had motive to secrete the child away and claim that the Tsarina had not in fact been pregnant. Her pregnancy had been previously reported in the European press. In 1905, several months after the August 1904 birth of Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia, Vachot returned to France a rich man, having been generously compensated by the Romanovs. De Graaff told the Daily Telegraph in October 1968 that Hemmes told her the truth about her origins in 1937. At that time she received her dowry from the Romanovs: five million rubles, a cloth belonging to the crown jewels, china and \\"trinkets.\\" Hemmes supposedly told her that he had received \\"hush money\\" from the Romanovs to stay quiet about his daughter's true origins. A side note to the story is that Hemmes, who came from a poor family and was himself impoverished, was able in 1919 to build a luxurious home for his family in Rotterdam, which he later lost through incompetent business dealings. Moreover, Suzanna de Graaff left the paper rubles she claimed to have received as a dowry to her three children, one of whom, Anton van Weelden (de Graaff was married twice, producing van Weelden from the first marriage and twin daughters from the second), showed his portion to reporter James Lovell in 1989. Lovell reported in his book \\"Anastasia: The Lost Princess\\" (St. Martin's Press, 1991) that the pre- revolutionary rubles shown to him by van Weelden had apparently never been circulated; they were new, still crisp and in numerically sequential order. Anderson told the Daily Telegraph that she accepted De Graaff as her sister. The two women first met in Germany in about 1950 and exchanged letters.Lovell, pp. 443-445 De Graaff's sister Adriana Hemmes rejected de Graaff's claim to be a fifth daughter of Nicholas and Alexandra as completely false and was estranged from de Graaff in their later years.Lovell, pp .442-443 De Graaff died of a heart attack in November 1968.Lovell, p. 425 De Graaff never tried to capitalize on her claims, and in fact made them public only weeks before her death.

Historic background = Neolithic Period = The history of pottery in the region begins in the Late Neolithic period, sometimes known as Pottery Neolithic (PN) or occasionally, based on a supposed local sequence of the site of Jericho, Pottery Neolithic A.  Pre-Pottery Neolithic (ca. 8300‚Äì ca. 5500 BC)  There is no good evidence for pottery production in Early Neolithic (Pre-pottery Neolithic/PP) times, but the existence of pyrotechnology that allowed humans to attain temperatures in excess of 1000 ¬∞C for reducing limestone to lime to make plaster, indicates a level of technology ripe for the discovery of pottery and its spread. In the PPN period portable vessels of lime plaster, called \\"vaisselles blanche\\" or \\"White Ware\\" served some of the functions that pottery later fulfilled. These vessels tended to be rather large and coarse and were somewhat rare. There are some indications that pottery may have been in use in the third and final phase of Early Neolithic, PPNC (recognized Early Neolithic phases are, beginning with the earliest, PPNA, PPNB and PPNC); however such artifacts are rare, their provenance equivocal and the issue remains in doubt. Approximately sometime in the late 6th millennium BC pottery was introduced into the southern Levant and it became widely used. The supposedly sophisticated forms and technological and decorative aspects suggested to archaeologists that it must have been received as an imported, technological advance from adjacent regions to the north and was not developed locally. The evidence for this hypothesis, however, remains equivocal for lack of documentation in the archaeological record. This hypothesis also does not take into account the bulk of simple, rudely fashioned vessels that were part of the ceramic repertoire of this period.  Pottery Neolithic (ca. 5500‚Äìca. 4500 BC)  Because of discoveries of earlier pottery traditions made starting in the 1990s, the time frame for the initial Late Neolithic ceramic period is thought to be roughly 7000-6700 BCE. These earliest pottery traditions may be known in literature as 'Initial Pottery Neolithic' in the Balikh River area of Syria and Turkey, for example Tell Sabi Abyad.The very oldest pottery of Tell Sabi Abyad (and of Syria), 7000-6700 BC www.sabi-abyad.nl Or it may be known as 'Halula I' in the Syrian Euphrates area; the main site is Tell Halula. Also, it may be known as 'Rouj 2a' in Northern Levantine Rouj basin (Idlib, Syria).Syro-Japanese Archaeological Investigation - Rouj Basin Project, Syria By the earliest PN phase pottery was ubiquitous and it remained so for virtually all periods in the southern Levant until modern times. Exceptions were in desert areas where semi-nomads favored less heavy, fragile and bulky arrangements. Pottery styles, based mostly on form, fabric and decorative elements have been used to help identify chrono-cultural phases. White ware remained in use, but it seems to have remained rare and the vessels were often small and rather delicate. It is possible that not a few such vessels were found and identified as pottery. The earliest PN phase is associated with the site of Sha'ar HaGolan in the Jordan Valley. This pottery is sometimes called \\"Yarmukian Ware\\". The diagnostic pottery typical of this period is somewhat sophisticated. Its most outstanding aspect is the use of long, narrow, incised bands of lines filled with herringbone decoration, often painted red or yellow. Forms of vessels may be quite delicate and lug handles on small jars with long necks are not uncommon. More common, coarser and less well made vessels are also present but are less diagnostic for the period. Common or cruder wares generally have simple shapes and are often less well finished and are not decorated. Vessel walls of this class are often of uneven thickness and look 'lumpy'. This crude aspect is often further emphasized by grass-wiped exteriors and the negative impressions left by straw or vegetal tempers (i.e. chopped up dried grass or weeds) which combust and leave hollows after firing. These inclusion were either added intentionally, or are the unintentional result of poorly levigated (i.e. a process of purifying clay by removal of natural, non-clay inclusions such as stones and plant materials) or unlevigated clay, and are characteristic of this coarse Neolithic pottery. Later Neolithic pottery tends to favor the use of different tempers, sand, gravel, small stones and sometimes grog (ground up pottery). Much Neolithic pottery is low-fired and did not attain temperatures far above 600¬∞C, which is more or less the minimum required for creating pottery from low-fired clays. Probably these vessels were pit-fired rather than fired in kilns, although such an hypothesis remains to be proven. To date there is no direct evidence in excavation based literature on how Neolithic peoples of the southern Levant fired their pottery. Later Neolithic pottery has less distinctive features. Work at Jericho by K. Kenyon suggested to her two periods of Late Neolithic, based on the existence of coarser and finer pottery groups. The former, supposedly representing a less sophisticated and earlier occupation, was labeled PNA (Pottery Neolithic A); the latter was called PNB (Pottery Neolithic B). Many researchers now believe the difference to be one of function rather than evidence for chronological differences between these two groups, since examples of each are often found in contemporary contexts. Thus, PNB types are often designated as fine or luxury wares. The site of Munhatta, excavated by J. Perrot, has contributed a large series of ceramic assemblages dated to the Neolithic period. In one phase there are some extraordinarily sophisticated ceramic vessels of especially finely levigated, highly polished or burnished (polishing of almost dry, leather hard, surfaces of unfired clay to produce a smooth surface that becomes shiny when fired), black fabric. Other pottery suggests that some potters in this period, dated later than an earlier, \\"Yarmukian\\" phase at the site (identified by Sha'ar HaGolan type pottery), were highly skilled craftspeople. One researcher, Y. Garfinkel, refers to this phase as \\"Jericho IX\\" after a stratum and associated pottery excavated by J. Garstang at Jericho (he excavated at Jericho prior to Kenyon). The decorated pottery of this period often has red paint in the form of stripes, sometimes in large, wide herringbone-like decorations. Not all pottery from these phases is so chrono-culturally diagnostic. Most vessels are of plain wares and utilitarian types. In addition, other methods of decoration are known in the later Neolithic. They include the use of slips (color applied to an entire vessel), burnishing and incising (e.g. notching, combing, slashing, etc.). Wavy lines of combing, often combined with painting are one of the distinctive types of Late Neolithic decoration associated with the Rabah phase (see below). The use of red slips and paints is common in this and later periods, and is probably the direct outcome of clays used, which are rich in iron oxides that tend, under some conditions, to fire to earthy red tones ranging from brown to orange and brick-red. These same clays, when fired in a reducing atmosphere (i.e. devoid of oxygen) often become gray or black in color. Dark colored, gray to black cores on some pots indicate incomplete firing The most recent PN phase is named after the site of Wadi Rabah, excavated by J. Kaplan. Y. Garfinkel relegates this final LN period to Early Chalcolithic. The distinction seems to be mostly a matter of terminology. Since there is no definitive break between Late Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic, each researcher must decide what is Neolithic and what is Early Chalcolithic. The situation is even more complicated because there appears to be considerable regional variation in Neolithic pottery assemblages and not a little confusion as to what constitutes chrono-culturally related assemblages. That is a function of the generally poor preservation of PN sites and the way in which they were excavated. Summary: Neolithic pottery may well have arrived as a full-blown technological set from more northerly regions. Pottery appears to have become ubiquitous in the southern Levant by late in the 6th millennium and remained as an integral part of human material culture up to the present. Some local potters showed particular skill in their production, which suggests, as is the case with flint knappers, real craft specialization. That is related to skills in finding and preparing raw materials, fashioning pots, decorating them, and controlling the pyrotechnology needed to turn them into pottery. Some aspects of pottery, form, fabric, modes of decoration are relatively reliable diagnostic indicators of chrono-cultural identities of human society. Pottery, mostly in the form of sherds, often makes up the bulk of material culture artifacts found on excavated sites dating from the PN period.  Chalcolithic Period (Early 4th Millennium BCE‚Äìca. 3500 BCE)  The Chalcolithic (or \\"Copper-Stone Age\\") is a chrono-cultural period that may have lasted for over a millennium, although the date of its end is somewhat problematic. The earliest phases of this period are associated with pottery that is little different from the pottery of the Latest Neolithic periods (see Late Neolithic Pottery). While plain wares probably dominate most assemblages, it is the decorated types which have been paid most attention to by scholars. There are few well excavated sites and no good stratigraphic sequences that have produced enough well-stratified pottery to allow for the development of any reliable chronological sequence in pottery styles, although some are claimed. Pottery of the Chalcolithic period can, for the present, be divided into two major chronological groups, Early and Late Chalcolithic. The more distinctive is the later group, known from some extensively excavated sites which have yielded large ceramic repertoires. There appear to be regional differences, especially between the northern and southern spheres of the southern Levant and at sites to the east. Some of these differences may also be chronological; new 14C (radiocarbon) dates suggest one type site, Teleilat el Ghassul in the northern Aravah Valley in Jordan, is somewhat earlier in date than a group of sites in the Beersheva Basin. Garfinkel's attempt to divide this period into three phases, Early, Middle and Late, is based on a number of spurious assemblages and is lacking in authority. While such chronological distinctions may be possible, not enough is presently known of the sequence of the Chalcolithic for determining it. Pottery of the Early Chalcolithic period is often similar to that of the Late Neolithic. One diagnostic feature of this period is found in pottery made on mats, probably of straw. When this was the case, the clay was pressed into the weave of the mat, leaving an impression which potters sometimes did not remove. Thus some bases of vessels in this period bear distinct patterns of mats on which they were made. Other techniques used for pottery production in this period include painting and slipping of exteriors, and the limited use of incised decoration, sometimes in a fish bone pattern but of usually much larger dimensions than that associated with Yarmukian pottery. One specialized form associated with this period is the so-called 'torpedo' vessel, a long narrow, thick-walled jar with two large, vertical lugs attached to its upper, almost tube-like body. Pottery of the Late Chalcolithic period sees a continuation of many of the basic shapes and types of the earlier period, but much of the typical decoration of the earlier Chalcolithic is discontinued. Late Chalcolithic pottery is known for some special shapes including: 1)cornets‚Äîcone-like vessels with narrow apertures and long, highly tapered sides ending in exaggerated, long stick-like bases; 2) (so-called)churns or bird vessels, barrel-shaped vessels, often with bow shaped neck, one flat end and two lugs at either horizontal end of barrel, intended for suspension; 3) small bowls with straight sides tapering to flat bases (so-called V-shaped despite the flat bases; fenestrated-pedestaled bowls, small vases with vertical lugs pierced circularly, vertical tube handles, large holemouths with broad shoulders and relatively narrow bases. Small bowls and cornets of this period can be especially thin and appear to have been turned on wheels, but they are only finished that way. Recent research on the techniques of bowl making in this period indicate these vessels, while turned on a wheel, were actually only finished that way by scraping, after having been fashioned by hand. There is no evidence to show that the fast potter's wheel was used in the Chalcolithic period for 'throwing pots' using centripetal force. The wavy line or indented ledge handle makes its appearance in the central littoral in this period, presaging its adoption as the most common type of handle throughout the Early Bronze Age. Common decorations include raised, rope-like bands on some vessels, red painting and pie-crust like decoration on rims of large vessels (excepting holemouths. Combing, that produced wide, broad, flat lines, is sometimes found on jars of the Late Chalcolithic. Pronounced regional variations as well as functions of sites determine the kinds of vessels, types of clay used, and the forms of decoration preferred. Chalcolithic pottery technology and morphology greatly influenced the ceramic styles of the succeeding Early Bronze I period, especially in the southern region. Specialized production of ossuaries (boxes intended to hold bones after decarnation; i.e., secondary burials) is well documented in this period. It includes many types of rectangular boxes, some with extremely elaborate facades. Some anthropomorphic visages appear on these ossuaries in three- dimensional sculpting (rare), often with the nose particularly prominently, while other features are generally painted. Some ossuaries are fashioned of typical jars, altered and adorned for this specific mortuary-related function. = Early Bronze Age (ca. 3500 ‚Äì ca. 2300 BCE) = Abandonment of many sites at the end of the Chalcolithic period and major changes in material culture led archaeologists to name the post Chalcolithic period the \\"Early Bronze Age,\\" a misnomer (only copper without tin {copper + tin = bronze} was in use) that has become an accepted convention. Pottery continued to be made in quantity and, until quite recently there was thought to have been a thoroughgoing break in traditions from earlier periods, in typology and morphology. While major differences are known and became greater as the Early Bronze Age progressed, the earliest phases show more than a modicum of continuity with Chalcolithic potting traditions. The Early Bronze Age may now be divided up into three sequential phases, Early Bronze I, Early Bronze II and Early Bronze III. Some scholars include an Early Bronze IV in the Early Bronze Age. That period is known to other scholars as Middle Bronze I, Early Bronze-Middle Bronze and Intermediate Bronze. On the basis of pottery styles there is some justification for using the term Early Bronze IV. Early Bronze I (ca. 3500 - ca. 3000 BCE) pottery in the southern region is obviously derived from Chalcolithic traditions. Similar types of vessels are known and they were, in the earliest phases, made according to traditional Chalcolithic methods of manufacture. In the north there seems to be much less continuity, but that may be more of perception of the archaeological record. Unfortunately there is no good Chalcolithic sequence in the north from which one may learn precisely what the latest Chalcolithic facies is. What is clear is that in the earliest phases of EB I there is a pronounced regionalism that becomes less visible over time. Regionalism is particularly marked in the earliest phase of Early Bronze I, with a dichotomy between northern and southern spheres of influence and a mosaic of more localized traditions within those larger spheres. In the southern region pie-crust type decoration is commonly found on large storage jars, while for the first time this type of detail is also found on holemouth vessels. The ledge handle becomes prominent in this period; its earliest exponents, obviously inherited from the preceding period, is notable for almost invariably having a wavy-line edge in many variations. Only rather late in the period and in specific regions was this appendage made with smooth edges. Poor preservation at most southern sites has limited knowledge of the typology of this early phase. Pottery from the northern region fully recognized as Early Bronze I, shows less evidence of owing its inspiration to the preceding period. However, this may merely be a function of limited perception by researchers who fail to distinguish the pottery of what may be an initial phase of Early Bronze I. A slightly later phase is well known from a number of sites, the best known of which is Yiftah'el in the Beit Netofa Valley system. The site has yielded a relatively large corpus of reasonably preserved vessels. The most distinctive pottery of this period is known as \\"Gray Burnished Ware\\" or sometimes as \\"Esdraelon Ware\\" or Proto-Urban C pottery. This ware is known for its generally gray color, highly burnished finish, and a limited and distinctive range of morphological types, almost invariably bowls. Most of the bowls have a carinated (angled) profile, some of them with flat projections forming an undulating line in a birds eye view. Similar morphological types are also found in red or in buff colors. Additional ceramic types have features that are reminiscent of Chalcolithic types. In addition the ledge handle is also prominent in this period. Pottery is always handmade and in the earliest phases appears to have been home-made by local potters working within general traditions of how a pot should look, but with little slavish copying. The high loop handle was popular in this period for jugs and juglets. A second phase of Early Bronze I may be seen in both the northern and southern regions. In the north much pottery is painted or slipped red and burnished. Gray Burnished Ware continues to be made but examples of this ware, in the earlier period finely made and obviously luxury items, are less well made. A related morphological type is a curved bowl with a line of evenly spaced conical protrusions just below the rim on the exterior of the vessel. Such bowls are also known to be red-slipped in the north; in the south similar types are very rare and neither slipped nor burnished. Grain-wash, a kind of painting that leave a pattern that is slightly reminiscent of wood (sometimes called band-slip) makes its appearance in this period in the north. Pithoi are of different types. Two well-known types are distinguished by their rims; one has a pronounced bow-rim, while the other has a thickened rim with regular striations that give it its name, 'rail rim'. In the south there remains a deal of regionality, stressed by two types of decorated wares which only slightly overlap in their distribution. They are 'line painted group', red lines usually on a light background. Within that group is a very distinctive 'basket style', that imitates basketry. This type was commonly found in the Hill Country around Jerusalem and down to Jericho and Bab edh-Dhra in the Jordan Rift Valley. Further south, in the Shephela (piedmont) down to the Northern Negev is found a group of pottery with distinctive striated handles, often double stranded, and sometimes with thin coils of clay wrapped horizontally around where the handles were attached to the vessel walls. Other generic types were made, including more standardized pithoi, often with a thick, with quick-lime type coating on their exteriors. These pithoi were commonly decorated with flat, thin strips of clay placed horizontally around the vessel in 1 or more bands and pressed flat at regular intervals so as to give the impression of a rope. It is in this period that there is a great increase of standardization within the larger spheres, northern and southern. While no center of pottery production has yet been found, there seems to be evidence for extensive trading of pottery between sites or possibly from a central point of production. Only extensive petrographic analyses can help to prove this and perhaps pinpoint some possible location for such centers. By the third and final phase of Early Bronze I there remains a dichotomy between north and south, with red- burnishing as opposed to no burnishing and the extensive use of white, quick- lime slip reflecting northern and southern traditions, respectively. Extensive trade of ceramics, or possibly groups of itinerant potters seem to have left much evidence for their movement or that of pots between regions and within regions. Morphological types are shared from region to region and sphere to sphere, but often with localized details. All pottery from this period is handmade. Egyptian imported pottery if found in some sites in the south western region in this period. Most sites have only a small quantity, but a few select sites suggest prolonged contacts with Egyptians and possibly even Egyptians residing in the southern Levant. Khirbet Kerak ware, in a museum in Tel Aviv Pottery of Early Bronze I in the north seems to presage that of Early Bronze II in terms of morphology and decoration (especially red painting and burnishing), although in the later period potters achieved similar types through very different technological approaches. Wheels seem to have come into use and new fabrics, better levigated (cleared of coarse materials) were made. So-called 'metallic ware' was introduced in this period. Some examples look as if they were imitating metal, while the high-fired fabrics give off a metallic-like ring when struck. Jugs, platters of this ware were found alongside others of more plain fabrics. 'Metallic Ware' was probably made somewhere in Lebanon or in the region of Mount Hermon and disseminated to the south, generally as far as the Jezreel Valley. Further south similar morphological types are known, but they are of different wares. Early Bronze III types continue the earlier tradition, but in the north a new ware type, transported from the Caucasus and probably brought overland via Anatolia and Syria, makes its appearance. First discovered at Tel Bet Yerah on the Kinneret (Khirbet Kerak), on the southern shores of the Sea of Galilee / Lake Kinneret (in which excavations the ware was first defined during the 1920s), it is called Khirbet Kerak Ware. Khirbet Kerak ware It was obviously made by potters who brought the tradition with them. Examples are of highly distinctive types, jugse and jars, sometimes with fluting, painted and highly burnished red or black or a combination of these colors, andirons, some with decorations and faces, and carinated bowls. Khirbet Kerak Ware was always handmade. Khirbet Kerak Ware is also known as Red Black Burnished Ware (sometimes hyphenated \\"Red-Black\\") in west Syrian and Amuq Valley contexts. In Transcaucasia - from which area it seems ultimately to have originated - the ware is also referred to as Karaz or Pulur Ware. As such, it may be associated with the later historic appearance of the people recognised historically as the Hurrians. Petrographic analyses shows some of it was made locally. Other local traditions continue and eventually influenced the pottery of the Intermediate Age, which followed. The potter's wheel, used primarily for throwing small bowls using centrifugal force is known from this period. It represents an innovation that was continued in the following period, when it was employed to fashion rims for vessels of certain types. The piriform juglet makes its appearance in this period, but whether it has any connection with the later, Middle Bronze II vessels of analogous form, is unclear. With the exception of Khhirbet Kerak Ware, the pottery of this period continues the Early Bronze traditions and passed them on to the people who populated the small communities of the succeeding period.  Middle Bronze Age I (ca. 2300‚Äì ca. 2000 BC)  This period goes under a number of names: Early Bronze/Middle Bronze, Early Bronze IV and Intermediate Bronze are just some of the appellations given it. The pottery of the earliest phases has a clear 'Early Bronze flavor'. Some of the shapes of vessels and the details of them, e.g. flat bases and folded 'envelope-like' ledge handles indicate continuity of traditions. Indeed, recent evidence of Early Bronze III sites shows that certain forms made their appearance then and continued into Early Bronze IV or even later. The four-spouted lamp is one of these; another is the 'teapot' shape. There is a major dichotomy and great differences between the pottery of the northern and southern regions. Certain shapes are associated with particular fabric types which, can be related to one or the other region. The pottery of this period shows some innovations, including the use of the wheel for fashioning the rims of jars. In the south decoration was generally incisions, while painting was more common in the north. There are also regional variations with pottery from Transjordan somewhat different from that associated with areas west of the Jordan. Unfortunately relatively few settlements have been dug from this period and most of the pottery known is derived from tombs. That is because most of the major population centers were deserted at the end of Early Bronze III and people tended to settle in much smaller communities. Probably because they had less resources and perhaps had to work harder to keep themselves, they left relatively scanty evidence of their permanent settlements. Once it was believed that most of the people of this period were semi-nomadic, but as time goes by more and more evidence of sedentism in this period is being found. In the north is found the first evidence of infiltration of Syrian type pottery in a group of so-called 'Megiddo teapots', small, delicate, wheel-made vessels of high-fired, dark, almost metallic fabric decorated with white, wavy lines. Sites have yielded evidence of local variations in decoration, morphology and fabrics. One such is the use of burnished red slips known from the cemetery at Bab edh-Dhra. In the Beth Shan region certain vessels have special painted decoration, while a cave near Tel Qedesh in Upper Galilee yielded many pedestaled lamps. Basically, the pottery of this period represents the last dying gasps of a tradition that reaches back into the local Chalcolithic (with even earlier antecedents) period and continuing on into the Early Bronze Age. There are, however, hints at the major changes to come in influences from the area to the north, Syria, which was to revolutionize ceramic traditions in the southern Levant for the next two millennia.  Middle Bronze Age (ca 2000‚Äì ca. 1550 BC)  Pottery of this period owes relatively little to local antecedents. It has its roots in more northerly regions, especially in the traditions of Syria, which in turn was in contact with Mesopotamian and Anatolian regions. The pottery of the full-blown Middle Bronze Age (Middle Bronze IIA, IIB and IIC) represents a revolutionary tradition for the southern Levant. This period is divided into three different sub periods: MBII A, B, and C. We shall see that B and C are closer linked than A. This period is diagnosed by the well- burnished red slip so often seen in the corresponding layers at digs. The slip is normally used on the smaller vessels of the period. Other decorating techniques found to be frequent amongst this period's pottery are horizontal sometimes triangular designs in black or red paint. The second half of this period (B+C) is not seen by the burnished red slip, which all but disappeared during the eighteenth century, replaced by white/creamy slip. The pottery is often quite thinly walled and even kilned at high temperatures. Despite this, there is a progression of techniques from MBII A, which does denote continuity in society from then. Other noticeable traits of the period are a lack of painted design on most types of pottery and then only unicolored. The one color often tends to be stripes or circles with the odd bird making an appearance. These designs appear on ointment juglets. The ointment juglet is the most important piece of pottery of the period. The fashion of juglets swings gradually from piriform ones to cylindrical. Amongst these vessels we find zoomorphic shapes like animals or human heads. These designs are often accompanied by ‚Äúpuncturing‚Äù, which used to be filled by white lime. Lastly Chocolate on White Ware and Bichrome Ware are important pottery types appearing in the 16th century. The first of the two types consists of a thick white slip being applied followed by a dark brown paint. This type is found in the northern region of the country particularly close to the Jordan Valley. The Bichrome Ware the more important of the two can be found at Tel el-Ajjul and Megiddo among others. Its ‚Äúpendant‚Äù lines or stripes that come usually as black on white slip, or more commonly as red on black can help notice this type of pottery. Bichrome was imported from Cyprus.  Late Bronze Age (1550‚Äì1150 BC)  Due to the influx of imported types of pottery, the pottery of this period must be divided into four sub groups: = Local Pottery = The local shows that there is a clear evolution of the pottery through the MB to this period. The difference that can be remarked between the two periods is that the juglets that were once of great dispersion go down in popularity and become gray as the Late Bronze Age begins. In fact the local pottery is now mass-produced in a rough and cheap manner. Paint decoration returns to fashion, even though it is simply added to the light buff slip, and sometimes without slip. The paint shows many different geometric shapes, and sometimes inside painted on rectangular panels called metopes a sacred tree flanked by two antelopes can be found. = The Bichrome Group = Again in this period we can see that the majority of this group is red paint on black background. The most common vessels that we find this type in are kraters, jars and jugs. This group, after being tested with neutron activation techniques shows that it was imported from eastern Cyprus; this includes Cypriot Bichrome ware. The major controversy is whether the Cypriot market produced Canaanite styles for exporting purposes, or whether Canaanites were producing the pottery for the home consumption in Israel. This pottery was also to be found in Megiddo locally made. = Cypriot Imported Pottery = Bilbil juglets - Late Bronze Period Pottery in Hecht Museum, Haifa, Israel - Base Ring Ware; Late Bronze Age IIB ca. 1400-1200 BCE This is a selection of handmade pottery in different Ware styles. These styles are called: Base Ring, White Slip, Monochrome, White Shaved, White Painted, Bucchero. Of these different kinds, Monochrome, White Slip, and Base Ring were most used. It appears as though this type of pottery was found to be decorative in nature rather than useful. \\"Bilbil juglets\\" are an example of Base Ring Ware, which are pottery and have long slim necks.Bilbil juglets Archeologists speculate that bilbil juglets may have been used in the trade of opium, due to traces of opiates found in some of the styles of the jugs, as well as the shape of the vessel resembling an upturned Papaver somniferum. Distribution of pottery Neolithic sites in Southern Levant = Mycenaean Imports = This pottery was produced on inland Greece and throughout the Aegean islands. The fabrication technique used was fast-wheel, with fine well-levigated clay. The slip was of a light cream color to give the background to the exquisite decoration normally done in dark-brown color. Vessel types were small and closed flasks or ‚Äústirrup jars‚Äù. Towards the end of the Bronze Age there is evidence that Mycenaean Late Helladic IIIC pottery was being made by local potters from Canaanite clays. Either this indicates a resident population of Mycenaean potters in the so-called Philistine cities, or else it reflects an ethnic movement of new cultural elements into this region.  Iron Age I (1150‚Äì950 BC)  Two new major pottery groups appear in Canaan at this time. They have been related to the settlement of the Philistines and Israelites. = Philistine Bichrome Ware = This is the descendant of the imported Mycenaean Ware of the past period, which is known also as Mycenaean IIIC1b. This new style of pottery is made locally. Neutron analysis proves that it could have even been made in the same workshop. It began at approximately the 12th century BC and began to disappear towards the end of the 11th century BC. The style is slightly influenced by Egypt but mostly by Canaanite. The Mycenaean tradition holds a firm grasp over the shape of the pottery (for example ‚Äústirrup jars‚Äù), whereas bottles are found to share Cypriot styles (seen by tall and narrow necks). The decoration of this new ware has changed to red and black paints on a whitish slip. Birds and fish are found to be common on Mycenaean IIIC1b but less on the new style, in fact by the second half of the 11th century the bird which was once thought to be sacred disappeared from the pottery. = Israelite Pottery = The new Israelite settlers began by using basic types of Canaanite pottery until they began developing simple copies of the purchased pottery so as to meet their needs. The hallmark of this early Israelite style is the pithoi. They are scattered over these sites. Many of the storage jars had The ‚ÄúCollared Rim‚Äù, which were most popular to the central part of Israel, although they have since also been found to also have been manufactured in areas outside of the Israelite settlement area.  Iron Age II (1000‚Äì586 BC)  During the period of the United Monarchy, Israelite pottery improved. Finishing techniques used a remarkable amount of red slip, applied by hand and smoothed with an irregular burnish. At the division of the kingdom, however, pottery styles broke into two separate traditions. Samaria Ware is a general name given to the pottery of Israel (the northern kingdom), even though there is a wide variety of forms and styles. They can be put into two separate groups. The first is thick walled, with a high foot and red slip (sometimes burnished), most often shaped as bowls. The second is made of fine particles clay, and decorated with concentric stripes of red/yellowish colored slip. Judean pottery is altogether different, and slowly progresses into more and more sophisticated types/styles. By the 8th/7th centuries BC, Jerusalem pottery was especially good. All over the southern kingdom, a technique known as ‚Äúwheel burnish‚Äù was used. This term describes how an orange/red slip was applied, while the pot was on the wheel, and then burnished to a gloss using the potter's hands or smooth tools. =Classic period= During the Roman and early Byzantine period, the Levant was on the edge of the enormous territories where ancient Roman pottery was produced and used, often being transported long distances by sea. As in other areas, local traditions and mass-produced Roman styles co- existed, but the Levant never became a major centre producing wares for export, as the area of modern Tunisia did with its African red slip ware, and modern Turkey with Phocaean red slip, both often excavated in the Levant. However, the Levant was a production centre for large blocks of bulk raw Roman glass, which were shipped to various centres to be worked. Common kitchen ware of the Galilee region was produced primarily in Kafr 'Inan (Kefar Hananya). One item produced there, the \\"Kefar Hananya I CE type,\\" is also known as the \\"Galilean bowl.\\"Neusner et al., 2008, p. 203. This coarse ware network was one of many sub-regional and micro-regional coarse and fine ware ceramic culture networks in operation in the Levant.Wickhman, 2007, p. 773. =Middle Ages= Arab period In exploring the similarities throughout the different eras, Macalister discusses Palestinian pottery in the Arab period and its shared characteristics with the ancient and modern pottery produced in Palestine.Macalister, 1912, p. 228-231. Of the pottery from the Arab period, he notes: \\"...there seem to have been large globular jars, not unlike the Pre-Semitic and First Semitic barrel- shaped jars.\\" He describes them as having \\"ledge-handles, though of a different shape from the early ledge-handles,\\" and continues to write that, \\"... this kind of handle is still made in native pottery.\\" Further, he notes that jar-covers from this period are strikingly similar to those of the \\"earliest type of ware,\\" the \\"Second Semitic jar-covers, with two loops in the middle of the saucer.\\" The Potter and Wheel, Jaffa, in 1859. From Thomson, p. 282. The lamps produced during the Arab period are \\"either of the Hellenistic type, with long spout, or the Byzantine slipper form.\\" The \\"Third Semitic lamp\\" which almost completely disappears during the Hellenistic period, comes into use once again during the Arab period and Macalister notes that it is still frequently used among the Arab inhabitants of Palestine. Some of the linear decoration techniques also show a \\"startling resemblance to the painted ornament of the Second Semitic Period.\\" Macalister notes that the major differences are that \\"The slip and the paint have a fatter, richer texture in the Arab ware than in the Amorite, and the painted devices are more geometrical, more mechanical, and also more minute and 'finicking' in the later than in the earlier pottery.\\" As for similarities with the Roman period, horizontal ribbing, a key characteristic of Roman era pottery, \\"is as common in this period as in the Roman, but it seems to differ in outline.\\" Modern era Modern Palestinian pots, bowls, jugs and cups, particularly those produced prior to the establishment of Israel in 1948, are similar in shape, fabric and decoration to their ancient equivalents.Needler, 1949, pp. 75-76. Winifred Needler, Deputy Keeper of the Near Eastern Department at the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology writes in Palestine: Ancient and Modern (1949) that this continuity demonstrates \\"how persistently the potter's craft clung to tradition through the centuries.\\" R.A. Stewart Macalister, in his work The Excavation of Gezer (1912), underlines this point prefacing his overview of Palestinian pottery throughout the ages by noting that: > \\"... the division into periods [of Palestinian pottery] is to some extent a > necessary evil, in that it suggests a misleading idea of discontinuity - as > though the periods were so many water-tight compartments with fixed > partitions between them. In point of fact, each period shades almost > imperceptibly into the next.\\"Macalister, 1912, p. 131. Commenting further on modern examples of Palestinian pottery, Needler notes that the clay used is of much the same composition as the ancient examples and is shaped, smoothed and baked in the same way, with the surfaces often decorated in similar painted, incised, or moulded techniques. \\"Ramallah\\" ware, a think-walled, pinkish drab pottery painted with simple geometric and plant designs in red, is handmade; as are the \\"frying pan\\" and the home-made braziers. Other pottery is wheel-made, largely undecorated, but often with a glossy black glaze and crude designs in bright red. The Palestinian Association for Cultural Exchange (PACE) has put together a collection of traditional pottery, including cooking pots, jugs, mugs and plates that are manufactured by men and women from historic villages like al-Jib (Gibeon), Beitin (Bethel) and Senjel. They are handmade and fired in open, charcoal- fueled kilns as in ancient times. Palestinian ceramics are produced at traditional family-owned factories in Hebron and other cities. Covering a wide range of colorful hand-painted plates, vases, hanging ornaments, tiles, cups, jars and framed mirrors, the ceramics are known for the intricate detail of their flower and arabesque patterns. Palestinian artists who produce contemporary clay sculpture, like Vera Tamari from Ramallah, have incorporated the clay shards from ancient pieces into their work. Says Tamari, > \\"My own artwork is inspired by seeing the history in Palestinian land. For a > time, I used a lot of shards of pottery as a theme in my clay work. You find > shards of pottery everywhere because Palestine has had so many thousand of > years of history that you walk on a hill and you just find these little > pieces of pottery that are evidence of life that was there ‚Äî pieces of jars, > of plates, of bowls.\\" Dina Ghazal from Nablus use another approach, believing that abstraction will best express the essence of her ideas. The qualities of the material she works with are very important for Ghazal, she explains that her work is an attempt to show the versatility of the medium and she hopes to challenge traditional perceptions of the use of the clay.Dina Ghazzal See also * Syro- Palestinian archaeology * Israeli ceramics * Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware Gallery File:Pal Pottery Cal1.jpgArabic calligraphy on Ceramic.

Trichilemmal cyst is labeled near top. A trichilemmal cyst is a common cyst that forms from a hair follicle, most often on the scalp, and is smooth, mobile and filled with keratin, a protein component found in hair, nails, skin, and horns. Trichilemmal cysts are clinically and histologically distinct from trichilemmal horns, which are much rarer and not limited to the scalp. Rarely, these cysts may grow more extensively and form rapidly multiplying trichilemmal tumors, also called proliferating trichilemmal cysts, which are benign but may grow aggressively at the cyst site. Very rarely, trichilemmal cysts can become cancerous. Classification Trichilemmal cyst may be classified as a sebaceous cyst, although technically speaking it is not sebaceous. \\"True\\" sebaceous cysts, cysts which originate from sebaceous glands and which contain sebum, are relatively rare and are known as steatocystoma simplex or, if multiple, as steatocystoma multiplex. Medical professionals have suggested that the term sebaceous cyst be avoided since it can be misleading. In practice, however, the term is still often used for epidermoid and pilar cysts. Pathogenesis Histopathology of a trichilemmal cyst, from external (top) to internal (bottom): Updated: Jun 11, 2020, \\\\- Fibrous capsule \\\\- Small, cuboidal, dark-staining basal epithelial cells in a palisade arrangement, with no distinct intercellular bridging \\\\- Swollen pale keratinocytes, which increase in height closer to the interior \\\\- Solid eosinophilic-staining keratin There is no granular cell layer (in contrast to an epidermoid cyst). Trichilemmal cysts are derived from the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. Their origin is currently unknown, but it has been suggested that they are produced by budding from the external root sheath as a genetically determined structural aberration. They arise preferentially in areas of high hair follicle concentrations, therefore, 90% of cases occur on the scalp. They are solitary in 30% of cases and multiple in 70% of cases. Histologically, they are lined by stratified squamous epithelium that lacks a granular cell layer and are filled with compact \\"wet\\" keratin. Areas consistent with proliferation can be found in some cysts. In rare cases, this leads to formation of a tumor, known as a proliferating trichilemmal cyst. The tumor is clinically benign, although it may display nuclear atypia, dyskeratotic cells, and mitotic figures. These features can be misleading, and a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma may be mistakenly rendered.  Treatment  Surgical excision is required to treat a trichilemmal cyst. The method of treatment varies depending on the physician's training. Most physicians perform the procedure under local anesthetic. Others prefer a more conservative approach. This involves the use of a small punch biopsy about 1/4 the diameter of the cyst. The punch biopsy is used to enter the cyst cavity. The content of the cyst is emptied, leaving an empty sac. As the pilar cyst wall is the thickest and most durable of the many varieties of cysts, it can be grabbed with forceps and pulled out of the small incision. This method is best performed on cysts larger than a pea which have formed a thick enough wall to be easily identified after the sac is emptied. Small cysts have walls that are thin and easily fragmented on traction. This increases the likelihood of cyst recurrence. This method often results in only a small scar, and very little if any bleeding.

Biography Carl Braaten has authored and edited numerous books and theological papers, including Principles of Lutheran Theology (Fortress Press, 1983), Mother Church: Ecclesiology and Ecumenism (Fortress Press, 1998) and In One Body Through the Cross: The Princeton Proposal for Christian Unity (Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2003). Along with Robert Jenson, he has been an influential figure in developing and restoring the catholic roots of Lutheranism at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago. Braaten was born on January 3, 1929, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His parents were Norwegian-American pietists, who served as missionaries in Madagascar, and he received his early spiritual formation in that context. After finishing high school at Augustana Academy, a Lutheran boarding school in Canton, South Dakota, he attended St. Olaf College, Luther Seminary, Heidelberg University and Harvard Divinity School where he studied under Paul Tillich and earned his doctoral degree. His doctoral dissertation was titled Christ, Faith and History: An Inquiry into the Meaning of Martin K√§hler's Distinction Between the Historical Jesus and the Biblical Christ Developed in the Past and Present Context. He was ordained by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1958. At that time, he began serving a parish in Minneapolis and teaching at Luther Seminary. In 1961 Braaten, together with Robert Jenson, Roy Harrisville, Kent Knutson, James Burtness and others, founded the journal Dialog, which he continued to serve as editor until resigning in 1991. In 1962, Braaten accepted a position at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago where he taught as Professor of Systematic Theology until 1991 and where he is still recognized as Professor Emeritus. In 1991, Braaten and Jenson founded the Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology and established a new theological journal, Pro Ecclesia.

The walls are built primarily of large ashlar blocks that form massive lintels, as well as smaller blocks that compose lug sills and string courses. Individuals may enter the house through a Romanesque entryway, which is accessed by a large front porch. Stone's house was typical of the Hannaford style; four other Hannaford houses from the same period of time remain in Cincinnati, and all five buildings feature walls of coursed ashlar. By the late nineteenth century, Hannaford's name was well known both in Cincinnati and elsewhere; he had produced the grand Music Hall in the 1870s, and many of the city's richest residents commissioned houses from him in the city's most prestigious neighborhoods. Dozens of nineteenth-century Hannaford designs remain in Cincinnati, including twenty houses; many of them have been deemed as worthy of historic preservation because of their distinctive architecture. Among these houses is the Stone House, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, due to architecture that makes it important statewide, along with most of Hannaford's remaining buildings in Cincinnati.

He was assisted by Don Giovanni de' Medici, Ferdinand's half-brother, and Alessandro Pieroni.

Since the canal's closure, it has largely been forgotten, but it has been designated a historic site. After Indiana began building the Whitewater Canal in the 1830s, Ohio businessmen urged the construction of an extension from the canal to Cincinnati.

This tunnel was needed because of a steep ridgeline on the village's northern side, separating it from Cleves, on land owned by retired war hero William Henry Harrison, who as one of the canal's proponents was happy to sell land for its right-of-way and to supply wood and bricks for the tunnel. After his ascension to the presidency and sudden death, Harrison was buried atop the ridgeline near the tunnel's southern portal.Cincinnati & Whitewater Canal Tunnel, Ohio Historical Society, 2000.

As the state's first tunnel of its type, the Cincinnati and Whitewater Canal Tunnel has suffered two separate collapse incidents. The first occurred during the construction process, and six workmen died, while another segment caved in during the 1950s during a project to improve the portion of U.S. Route 50 that travels over the tunnel.\\"Bridge, Tunnel Named to Historic Register\\", Cincinnati Post via archive.org, 2001-07-06.

This resulted in the abandonment of the canal tunnel, a period of stagnation that ended in 1863 when a railroad company began a twenty-five-year period of using it as an ordinary rail tunnel. Since the rail line ceased operation in 1888, the canal has become completely unusable, having silted up almost all the way to the ceiling.Reilly, Mary Bridget. Unearthing a Buried Treasure .

These buildings were the oldest existing structures in the Cincinnati Zoo complex at the time.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 578. Two of the buildings were separately included in the \\"Cincinnati Zoo Historic Structures\\" designation in 1987 and named a National Historic Landmark: the Monkey House and the Elephant House. Built of concrete and stone,, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2013-11-26. the Monkey House had been constructed by 1880, along with the Aviary, although the Elephant House was built in 1902. Space for all of these animals has been a component of the zoo since its earliest years: when it first opened in 1875, its collection comprised the menagerie of Andrew Erkenbrecker, a prominent bird collector who desired to form the country's first zoological gardens. Besides a group of birds that he had collected, Erkenbrecker owned a group of mammals of all types, including multiple monkeys as well as an elephant that he had bought from a circus. =Elephant House= An elephant at the Elephant House Equipped with minarets and a windowed dome, the Elephant House was built to evoke the Taj Mahal and a sense of contemporary India. This concrete structure measures in length and height respectively. In building such a structure, the zoo followed the pattern of many other zoos, which constructed animal houses in the styles of the countries whence the animals came, but the Elephant House was one of the last zoo buildings in the United States constructed with such a philosophy. Designed by architects Elzner and Anderson, it was placed atop the zoo's highest hill. Its original cost was $50,000, and in later years the zoo has expended further money on renovations.Kraft, Joy W. The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. Charleston: Arcadia, 2010. =Reptile House= Originally built as the Monkey House, the Reptile House is a round Moorish Revival building designed by James W. McLaughlin for use as the aviary. Its design centers around a large dome more than high, with numerous windows and skylights that enable it to be lit by sunlight, in addition to Corinthian columns. Although it was expanded in 1922 by the construction of a veterinary hospital, the zoo arranged for an extensive remodelling to prepare it for the reptiles that were first placed within it in 1951. Zoo historians claim the Reptile House as the oldest zoo building anywhere in the United States. The original Aviary no longer stands, having been destroyed in the 1970s; a collection of gorilla exhibits occupies the site now. The Kemper Log Cabin is also gone, having been moved to Sharon Woods Village in Sharonville in January 1982.\\"Potpourri\\". Cincinnati Magazine 1983-05, 183.

Produced by exploitation filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother Gene, it was one of the first films directed by Bernard L. Kowalski and was written by first-time screenwriter Martin Varno, who was 21 years old. It starred several actors who had regularly worked with Roger Corman, including Michael Emmet, Ed Nelson, Steve Dunlap, Georgianna Carter and Tyler McVey. The film was theatrically released in December 1958 on a double bill with She Gods of Shark Reef. It took Varno six weeks to write the script, the original working title of which was Creature from Galaxy 27. The story was partially influenced by the real-life Space Race and the Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World (1951). Screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith gave Varno uncredited assistance with the dialogue. With a budget of about $68,000, it was shot over seven days at the Charlie Chaplin Studios, Bronson Canyon and a television station on Mount Lee in Hollywood. The Blood Beast alien costume was also previously used in the Roger Corman film Teenage Caveman (1958), which was filmed just two weeks earlier. Art director Daniel Haller, who built the rocket-ship and other props, slept at the sound stage between work sessions. Following dissatisfaction with his treatment by the Cormans, Varno pursued two successful arbitration cases, one of which was for underpayment. The other was in response to Gene Corman's original story writing credit, even though Varno claimed to have written the entire story himself. The film was featured in a 1996 episode of the comedy television series, Mystery Science Theater 3000. Plot Night of the Blood Beast A rocket-ship carrying astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, marking the United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, the ship is struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by what appears to be a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as it should be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells. The team tries to call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is attacked by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although he did not get a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard- like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different. As the others plot to destroy the creature with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the creature in a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman's brain, the creature is now able to speak with the scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but the creature insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature claims is the only way to truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity. Cast *John Baer as Steve Dunlap *Angela Greene as Dr. Julie Benson *Ed Nelson as Dave Randall *Georgianna Carter as Donna Bixby *Michael Emmet as Major John Corcoran *Tyler McVey as Dr. Alex Wyman *Ross Sturlin as The Creature Production =Writing= Roger Corman was an executive producer on Night of the Blood Beast. Night of the Blood Beast was one of several films produced by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called \\"some sort of a weird idea for the picture\\". They offered Varno a couple hundred dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as \\"scale\\", but Varno was not part of the Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: \\"I gave them the impression that I knew pretty much what I was doing, and they sort of got the idea that I wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things.\\" It took about six weeks to write the Blood Beast script. It was written under the working title Creature from Galaxy 27, which was conceived by Varno, but the Corman brothers later changed it to Night of the Blood Beast. Gene Corman received film credit for conceiving the film's story, but Varno claimed he wrote the film almost entirely himself and that Corman had little to do with the story: \\"He had some rambling ideas but they didn't have very much to do with the movie that became Night of the Blood Beast.\\" Varno also said of him: \\"Gene didn't open his mouth, really, until Roger told him he could.\\" Varno said he wrote the screenplay alone and showed parts of it to Roger and Gene Corman as he went along. Varno researched medical and aerospace technology at a library in Hollywood near Vine Street. The story, which fictionally portrays America's manned voyage into space, was heavily influenced by the real life Space Race ongoing between the United States and Soviet Union at the time. Gene Corman said another major inspiration was The Thing from Another World (1951), a Howard Hawks-directed science fiction film about a group of soldiers and scientists threatened by an alien creature in a remote Arctic research outpost. He said of the film, \\"How could you not be [influenced]? We had to be, if only indirectly or subconsciously. That was a classic film then, a classic film today.\\" However, Varno said any influence from The Thing was only subconscious: \\"I loved some of the scenes in The Thing and I'm sure that crept in one way or another, but not overtly.\\" Varno said he received uncredited assistance from his friends and fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster at the end of the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply because someone or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination. =Casting= The Cormans cast the film together with director Bernard L. Kowalski, who was 28 years old at the time. Kowalski also directed Roger Corman's Hot Car Girl. Night of the Blood Beast was one of Kowalski's first directorial credits and his first science fiction film, although he later went on to direct Attack of the Giant Leeches. For the Blood Beast cast, they mostly selected actors that had worked on other Roger Corman films. Michael Emmet had worked with Kowalski on the Western television series Boots and Saddles, where Kowalski directed most of the episodes Emmet had a major role in and was impressed with the actor's work ethic. Emmet later starred in the Roger Corman film Attack of the Giant Leeches. Ed Nelson also worked on several Roger Corman films, including Swamp Women (1955), Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957), Teenage Doll (1957) and She Gods of Shark Reef (1958). When asked what Nelson remembered about the film during a 2003 interview, he admitted, \\"Not much\\", but he said Roger and Gene Corman were very knowledgeable about film and treated the material \\"light-heartedly\\". =Filming= The film was shot over seven days with a budget of about $68,000. Both Roger and Gene Corman were present for most of the film's production and involved creatively as well as financially. Gene was more involved with running the day-to-day operations while the more experienced Roger Corman supervised and provided guidance to both Gene and Kowalski. Martin Varno was also present for shooting. They operated out of the Charlie Chaplin Studios, which was called Kling Studios at the time. Some rewriting was done as the filming progressed, and director Bernard L. Kowalski called it a collaborative process that involved himself, the Cormans and the whole crew. Varno, however, said he was not happy with how the filming process went, and that the Cormans changed dialogue and story elements without his consultation or permission. He said it reached the point where he called his agent and said, \\"I am not working for these sons of bitches any more! I am sick and tired of the whole thing!\\" All of the interior scenes were shot at sound stages inside Kling Studios. Most of the exterior shots were filmed at Bronson Canyon, a set of caves at Griffith Park in Los Angeles that was a popular shooting location for low-budget films. The exterior scenes of the tracking station were shot at a television station on Mount Lee, not far from the Hollywood Sign. Varno said it was the first television station built in Los Angeles, but was only being used for emergency broadcasts when Blood Beast was filmed; it had also been used during World War II to send information and propaganda to the Allied Forces' overseas allies. Varno secured permission to film there simply by calling the city of Los Angeles and asking permission, something he said nobody else considered trying because they assumed the city would not allow it. Varno was familiar with the station because his father, Roland Varno, appeared in the first dramatic television show released in Los Angeles and it was transmitted from that station. For the Blood Beast shoot, Los Angeles charged a fee of $8 per actor to shoot at the station, but the crew could be any size. All shooting took place outside the station and none inside. Most of the station night scenes there were shot during the day, and the film crew often had to find shadows to shoot in or block out the sun to give the impression of nighttime. Gene Corman said of the shooting: \\"That was one of the more mobile units I've ever been involved with. Normally, everybody chases the sun; we were chasing the shadows.\\" The alien costume featured in Night of the Blood Beast was the same as the one used in another Roger Corman film, Teenage Caveman (1958). This was done to save money, as the Cormans often tried to incorporate existing sets, costumes and other elements from previous films into new ones for financial savings. Varno said the Corman brothers were so conscious of their spending that \\"'cheap' was the main word in their vocabulary\\". The monster costume scenes in Teenage Caveman and Night of the Blood Beast were shot within about two weeks of each other. The costume was modified slightly for Blood Beast; Varno claimed somebody on the set said \\"the nose looks too Jewish\\", so it was cut down slightly to more resemble a beak. Ross Sturlin wore the costume for the scenes in both Teenage Caveman and Night of the Blood Beast. Filming was very difficult for Sturlin because it grew extremely hot inside the costume during the exterior shots. John Mathew Nickolaus, Jr. was director of photography for the film, and Jack Bohrer was the production manager. Daniel Haller, who went on to become a film director himself, worked as art director on Night of the Blood Beast. Haller did much of the manual construction work on the set himself, and brought a trailer in to the sound stage so he could sleep there and between work sessions. Among the props he built was the rocket-ship, the frame of which was made of plywood that had been cut into circles, then covered with a plastic sheet and spray- painted to look metallic. Haller also created blood cells that the characters looked at under a microscope, and the baby aliens (which resembled seahorses) they looked at under a fluoroscope. Alexander Laszlo composed the music for the film. Almost the entire crew went on to work on Attack of the Giant Leeches with the Corman brothers and Kowalski. WGA arbitration Martin Varno's dissatisfaction with the Cormans eventually led him to take them into formal arbitration proceedings. Although Varno was not a member of the Writers Guild of America when he wrote the Blood Beast script, he was encouraged by actor Jay Jostyn to discuss the matter with them. According to Varno, Jostyn claimed several actors and writers had similar problems with the Cormans in the past, but were not taking action because the Cormans provided them continued work in their films. After meeting with the Writers Guild, Varno became a member and filed arbitration papers against the Cormans for not paying him enough. Roger Corman was in the process of editing the film when he received the arbitration notice, and he became so angry he started screaming and throwing things in the cutting room. Varno claims one of the film crew members approached him (Varno) and promised that the Cormans would hire Varno to work on many of their future films if he dropped the matter, but Varno refused. Varno later filed a second arbitration upon learning that Gene Corman was to receive writing credit for the original story. Varno claimed Corman had nothing to do with the story, and produced large amounts of dated notes he claimed proved he wrote it himself. Varno won both arbitration matters. However, Roger Corman refused to pay Varno, and as a result he was not allowed to use Writers Guild of America members on his films. Corman used non-union writers for several years, but he finally agreed to pay Varno when he wanted to use a union writer on one of his films. Varno said he would have sought more money for the delay, but he was out of the country when Corman paid the money and missed his opportunity. Additionally, despite winning arbitration in the writing credit matter, Gene Corman was given on-screen original story credit in Night of the Blood Beast. When contacted by the distributor, American International Pictures, he was told removing Corman's credit would mean recalling all of the prints and changing them, which would have cost thousands of dollars, and Varno agreed to allow it to remain unchanged. Release =Distribution= Night at the Blood Beast was distributed by American International Pictures. It was test-screened for audiences in unadvertised sneak previews, in which audiences attending a different film were surprised with a screening of Blood Beast instead. Coincidentally, Martin Varno attended one of these sneak previews without any advance knowledge of what it was. The screening was also attended by Roger and Gene Corman, who were not pleased by Varno's presence. It was the first time the screenwriter had seen the completed film, which he did not enjoy, and he said of watching it: \\"On my left side was sitting Forry Ackerman, and on my right side was sitting Jerry Bixby. And their main job was to keep my hands held down so I wouldn't cut my throat.\\" During its theatrical release, Night of the Blood Beast was a double feature co-billed with She Gods of Shark Reef. THe film was released in December 1958. =Reviews= John L. Flynn, a Towson University English professor who has written extensively about science-fiction film, unfavorably compared Night of the Blood Beast to The Creeping Terror (1964), which was also about an astronaut returning from space with a stowaway alien creature. Although Flynn said it lacked the \\"epic pretentiousness\\" of that film, he nevertheless said of Blood Beast: \\"Corman made a career out of making cheap knock-offs of popular films, but he seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel here\\". The Washington Post writer Tom Shales said \\"it would be hard to find a worse movie\\" and that the monster \\"looks like the San Diego Chicken after having been tarred and feathered\\". Film critic and historian Steven H. Scheuer said the plot was a good idea but criticized what he called a \\"sloppy execution\\". Literary and film critic John Kenneth Muir said he considered the film a failure because the monster \\"simply could not live up to expectations once revealed\\". Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars with the entry: \\"Well directed, but too low budget to succeed.\\" Night of the Blood Beast was among several films universally considered terrible that film reviewer Michael Adams watched as part of a book about his quest to find the worst film of all time. However, Adams said he enjoyed it on a B movie level, calling it \\"cheap but enjoyable and buoyed by its ideas\\". John Stanley, who hosted the San Francisco television show Creature Features about science-fiction films, said Night of the Blood Beast deliberately imitated the best scenes from The Thing from Another World. Chris Eggerston of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the alien in the film \\"looks like a human-sized parrot covered in feces\\" and ranked it as the fifth worst movie monster of all time. However, he said that the film's idea of an alien impregnating a human being was an \\"interesting concept,\\" noting that it was reused in Ridley Scott's Alien. Mystery Science Theater 3000 Night of the Blood Beast was featured in the seventh season premiere episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, along with Once Upon a Honeymoon (1956), a short film about a married couple forced to postpone their honeymoon even further so that the husband can write a song for a telephone company and an angel who helps them out. Night of the Blood Beast was one of several Roger Corman-produced or -directed films that were featured on the show, along with It Conquered the World (1956), The Viking Women and the Sea Serpent (1957), Teenage Caveman (1958), and Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959). Night of the Blood Beast was originally broadcast on November 23, 1995, as a Thanksgiving special; the non-movie segments revolved around Thanksgiving in Deep 13, the headquarters of the mad scientist who ran MST3K's bad movie experiment. The episode was later broadcast with all new non-movie segments; the original version ran only four times, none after the non-Thanksgiving version debuted February 3, 1996.Episode guide: 701 and 701T- Night of the Blood Beast (with short: ‚ÄòOnce Upon a Honeymoon‚Äô).

The show's episode guide, The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, calls the movie \\"a science fiction monster thriller with no thrills attached, featuring possibly the stupidest collection of scientists ever to peer into a microscope.\\" Recurring gags during the movie segments include referring to the parasites implanted in Corcoran by the alien as shrimp and mocking the feebleness of the government's response to a rocket crash, sending only a handful of scientists and a flatbed truck to investigate. The movie features \\"gray men talking flatly in a gray office,\\" head writer / performer Mike Nelson wrote. \\"The twist is that they all appear to be named Steve.

They are usually M16 rifles, and are commonly used in basic training. Trainees are issued rubber ducks to add realism to training without the dangers and maintenance inherent to real firearms. For example, rubber ducks are sometimes issued to troops before they have been properly trained to use actual rifles in order to become familiar with basic care, and responsible handling. Other times rubber ducks are issued as a time saver, where proper long-term care of a real firearm would distract from the main training focus, such as tactical combat casualty care training, or land navigation. Rubber ducks are also used where there is a disconnect between safety in the field versus in garrison. During bayonet drills, discharging a weapon against an opponent is to be avoided, whereas in the field discharging the weapon during a bayonet fight is often the goal. And in various ceremonial practices using a rifle capable of firing would serve no purpose. Some rubber ducks are made by filling and coating an actual decommissioned M16 rifle with rubber or plastic. Some are also made using decommissioned rifle parts, with rubber or plastic used for the other parts. Still others are made entirely of rubber or plastic that has been molded to resemble both the exact shape and weight of a rifle. Rubber duck use is being phased out in some areas of the Armed Forces, namely in Air Force Basic Training. They were replaced with M16 replica Drill purpose rifle: metal models that resemble M16 rifles, including most internal parts, but that lack the ability to fire.

The movie has amassed quite a reputation in certain circles for its depictions of hard drug usage in New York City's East Village area. Many of the cast members, including leading man John Spaceley, are actual junkies. The numerous shooting-up sequences are reportedly entirely real, as are many of the drug dens and their denizens.

He was very tall at around , and although not strongly enough framed to be ideal for long spells on hard wickets, his remarkably beautiful action compensated. He was able to gain pace and lift the ball sharply from even the beautiful Leyton pitches, and could be extremely difficult when helped by a heavy dew or shower that softened the surface. However, owing to business commitments, most of Louden's cricket was played for the Ilford club. Typically he was able to play seven or eight county matches per season. Because the matches he did play were usually against the strongest batting sides like Surrey, Yorkshire, Middlesex and Lancashire, Louden's career average of 22.35 does not look at all exceptional for an era of uncovered pitches. However, owing to the immense disparities in batting strength among the counties during the 1920s, Louden's average represents much better bowling than many bowlers with much lower averages against weak opposition. Business meant Louden never had the tiniest hope of going on a tour to Australia, though he was doubtless much better suited to the cast-iron Australian pitches than any English professional bowler of the time. Louden first played for Essex in 1912 at a time when Essex bowling was very weak with Buckenham's and Mead's careers nearly over. Despite a couple of promising performances in 1913 and 1914, it was not until 1919 that Louden showed his true class with seven for 42 on an excellent pitch against Lancashire and eight for 122 on a similarly good wicket against Sussex. His 66 wickets for 25 each looked nothing out of the common, but on featherbed Leyton pitches such figures constituted first-rate bowling, and he was picked for the Gentlemen at Lord's and The Oval but was overshadowed by his teammate Johnny Douglas, taking only one wicket in two games. In 1920 Louden was seen as disappointing with an average of over 27 (though this was largely due to the excellent pitches and only playing against strong counties), but in the following two years he performed so well on his limited appearances as to leave little doubt that he was the best bowler in England. His performance for the Gentlemen at Lord's in 1922 was the best bowling by an Englishman since Sydney Barnes was in his prime, whilst he was equally good against Surrey at The Oval in both 1922 and 1923 (with innings analyses of seven for 84 and six for 66 on perfect pitches). Despite this performance, he did not gain a Wisden Cricketer of the Year nomination. Although Louden bowled against the Australians in 1921 and took thirteen wickets in two innings, he was not chosen for any Test match, yet most historians believe his omission for Howell and Durston was a major error. Australian batsman Warren Bardsley thought it ridiculous that, although the England selectors went through fourteen bowlers that series, they never once turned to the man the Australians regarded as the best in the country. \\"All we did was tell the truth,\\" he said later. \\"We told everybody that Louden was England's best bowler. They thought we were leg-pulling and just didn't pick him!\\"Quoted in Fingleton, Jack: Masters of Cricket (Heinemann, 1958), p. 58. Bardsley and Herbie Collins were always at pains to give one another the strike when Louden was bowling. After 1922, Louden declined somewhat even though he could play a little more often than before. He still remained a formidable opponent, as shown against the South Africans in 1924 when he took ten wickets, and on a bad wicket at Lord's in 1925 with nine for 67. He played almost no cricket after 1925, but was fondly remembered by those who played with him as a bowler who deserved much higher honours than business permitted him to obtain.

At age 18, he enrolled at the University of Edinburgh to study medicine, graduating four years later in 1889. Campbell worked in London, Vienna and Prague, developing his neurological speciality. He became fluent in French, German and Italian. In 1892, Campbell was awarded a doctorate by the University of Edinburgh for his thesis The Pathology of Alcoholic Insanity. Campbell's longest post in the UK was the thirteen years he spent working at Rainhill Asylum, Liverpool. He was Resident Medical Officer and Directory of the Pathology Laboratory. During his time there, Campbell and the laboratory became internationally known, leading to visitors from all parts of the world. At the age of 37, in 1905, he returned to Australia and lived in Sydney. His focus shifted from neuroanatomy and neuropathology to working clinically as a neurologist. Shortly after his return, Campbell married a childhood friend, Jenny Mackay, with whom he had two daughters. He became a member of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1907. Campbell enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and served as Major in the army in Egypt during the First World War.

The original structure was built in 1100 as the primary residence of the Counts of Eberstein, but by the end of the 16th century had been abandoned and much of the castle was torn down to provide materials for other structures. Presently it is a German national monument and a State Palace of Baden-Wuerttemberg. History A spur castle situated on a once- strategic mountain peak, the fortress was constructed as the seat of the Counts of Eberstein perhaps as early as 1100. The oldest part of the castle remaining intact are the ramparts. The first historical mention of the castle occurs in 1197 as Castrum Eberstein. In the second half of the 13th century, the Ebersteins began construction on Castle Neu-Eberstein and the older seat declined in prominence and ultimately fell into disrepair; by 1573, it was uninhabited and thereafter became a quarry used by both the Eberstein descendants and locals. Starting in the 1800s, efforts have been made to preserve the site (which now consists solely of elements of the curtain wall and keep) and it presently one of the State Palaces and Gardens of Baden- Wuerttemberg, housing a restaurant and garden open to tourists.

They do this by being constructed with a curved moldboard that lies perpendicular to the direction of travel and a sidewall at either end that keeps the snow contained. For parking lots, runways, laneways, etc. this is an improvement on the traditional windrow plowing, which uses an angled plow to move snow to the side. Snow pushers allow the snow to be moved en masse and completely off site to be piled someplace out of the way.  History  Although snow pushers did not become widely used until the 1980s, they have been around since the 1970s. Initially, they were not produced by manufacturers, but they were recognized as a good idea by snow removal professionals who either welded their own or contracted to have them fabricated. For a long time, the most common snow pusher design was to take a septic tank or other large steel cylinder and cut it in half, then build a mounting system on the back to attach it to a machine. This type of bare bones construction lasted until the 1990s when various manufacturers began producing them commercially.  Design  Universal Loader Mounting Snow pusher designs vary across the industry. They are typically between 3 ft [0.9 m] and 5.5 ft [1.6 m] high and range from 6 ft [1.8 m] to 40 ft [12.2 m] wide. Snow pushers are typically mounted on wheel loaders, skid steers, or backhoes. For wheel loaders and backhoes, they are mounted using a universal mounting system that consists of a set of posts (or plates) between which the machine bucket is placed. Chains are attached to the snow pusher and the bucket and tightened using a chain binder. This system allows for snow pushers to be mounted on any machine without regard for brand-specific mounting brackets. Skid steer loaders can use the universal mounting system;How Caterpillar Skid Steer Loaders & Multi Terrain Loaders Work however, most manufacturers typically offer skid steer snow pushers with a universally accepted quick-attach system. Though the snow pusher might seem like a simple product, there are many variations across the industry in areas such as moldboard height and angle, sidewall support system (post, wedge, or unsupported), trip edge system, shoe thickness, and rubber cutting edge quality, to name a few.  Steel trip edge vs. rubber edge pushers  Snow pushers can be divided into two separate families: steel trip edge and fixed rubber edge. Both are used in the same fashion to move snow. Rubber edge snow pushers have a composite material mounted on the bottom of the moldboard which lies flush to the ground and keeps snow from passing under the pusher, getting a cleaner push than otherwise. Rubber edges are able to flex and pass over obstructions under most conditions. A pusher mounted on a loader Steel trip edge snow pushers have a spring-loaded steel cutting edge mounted to the bottom of the moldboard that allow them to scrape the pavement. They employ a tripping system to allow them to pass over obstructions such as uneven pavement or raised manhole covers. There are three types of trip edges in use today: compression spring, torsion spring, and composite material springs. Both compression and torsion spring systems work similarly; the steel edge is mounted on a hinge and is held in place by the pressure of the springs; when the edge meets an obstruction the springs compress and allow the edge to flip back and under the pusher and to pass over the obstruction. Composite material trip edges can act like a rubber band when the edge meets an obstruction allowing the steel edge to flip under the pusher and then snap back into place. During certain conditions where snow may tend to freeze to the ground, a steel edge may tend to clean better than rubber; however, during wet snowfalls a rubber edge will \\"squeegee\\" the pavement, leaving it much cleaner than a steel edge can. Also, rubber edges generally contour the ground much more effectively than steel because they flex over humps and into dips. One advantage of steel edges is the reduced drag they create. Rubber edges tend to act like a brake, taking much more power to push than a steel edge when scraping down to bare pavement. Both edges have their advantages and disadvantages, and while some companies have found ways to better contour pavement with a steel edge, their moving components may make them more fragile than continuously welded plows with rubber edges.

The school was opened in 1947, and was the sixth school named Ateneo by the Jesuits. It was closed in 1978 after the Jesuits agreed to redonate the Ateneo campus to the newly created Diocese of San Pablo. Ateneo de San Pablo was a small school since it was only a high school from 1947 to 1961. In 1962, it became a medium-size school when it opened its grade school. History Before World War II, the Jesuits accepted the invitation of Most Rev. Alfredo Versosa, D.D., Bishop of Lipa, to open a high school in San Pablo. The Bishop donated to the Jesuits the St. Francis Seminary buildings and the grounds adjoining it. War began before the school could open, and the war destroyed the buildings. But as soon as the war ended, the Jesuits began to carry out their part of the agreement. Early in 1946, Fr. John W. McCarron, S.J. of Washington, D.C., USA came to San Pablo to clear up the debris in the buildings donated to them. When his community of two men, Fr. Paul V. Finster, S.J. a priest and Fr. Francis Reilly, S.J., a scholastic, arrived, there were already available five classrooms, a library of about 2000 books, offices, a basketball court and three living rooms. With the physical requirements of the school done, the Jesuits turned to work for the school's advertisement, government recognition and recruitment of lay personnel. On July 1, 1947, the Ateneo de San Pablo was opened. Only first year high school students were accepted. sixty-nine students enrolled. A few months after the school opened, Fr. McCarron, the school's first Rector was reassigned. Fr. Finster became Rector. Fr. Finster, the missionary priest from Long Island, USA continued with the rebuilding of the ruins. He was able to enlist the help of Carlos Dychangco, an architect who drew up the plans and supervised the work which started in June 1950. In 1951, the Ateneo de San Pablo turned out its first graduates, 36 of them. In September 1954, Rev. Fr. Eusebio G. Salvador, S.J. succeeded Fr. Finster. During Fr. Salvador's term as rector, an auditorium-gymnasium was constructed, and the school chapel and Jesuit Residence were completed. In 1962, the Ateneo de San Pablo opened its grade school. In 1967, the Diocese of San Pablo was created, separate from the Lipa Diocese. The diocesan officials thought it logical that the site for the seminary and diocesan curia be in San Pablo. After the creation of the diocese, the newly appointed bishop, Most Rev. Pedro N. Bantigue, D.D. asked the Society of Jesus to redonate the Ateneo building site to the diocese. The Jesuits agreed to execute a deed of redonation and the signing of the deed was scheduled on March 11, 1969. The Ateneans and many sympathizers staged rallies and demonstrations to prevent the signing of the contract and they succeeded. In 1976, the Ateneo de San Pablo attained one of the most prestigious of its achievements. The school was accredited by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). The following year, the Ateneo de San Pablo was again threatened by the same case of 1969. On February 26, 1977, the Rome Supreme Tribunal ordered the Jesuits to comply with the redonation agreement made previously with Bishop Bantigue. The signing of the contract was rescheduled for June 15, 1977. In April of the same year, the Jesuits received a letter from Rome explaining the order for the Jesuits to leave the Ateneo site and informing them that the Bishop will pay P850,000.00 as compensation for the improvements made by them on the site. Ateneo community tried to prevent the signing of the deed but to no avail this time. The deed was signed and the ownership of the land and the buildings of the Ateneo was transferred to the Diocese. The twenty-eighth and last graduation day in the Ateneo de San Pablo was held on March 31, 1978, marking the end of a beloved institution. The Ateneo de San Pablo became the Liceo de San Pablo, a parochial school of the Diocese. School Rectors * John W. McCarron, S.J. - 1946-47 * Paul V. Finster, S.J. - 1947-54 * Eusebio G.

Alma Mater Song Ateneo de San Pablo's alma mater song was Hail, Ateneo, Hail!, which is also used by other Jesuit institutions in the Philippines. School name The name Ateneo is the Spanish form of the Latin name Athen√¶um, which the Dictionary of Classical Antiquities defines as the name of \\"the first educational institution in Rome\\" where \\"rhetoricians and poets held their recitations.\\" Hadrian's school drew its name from a Greek temple dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. The said temple, according to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, was where \\"poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions.\\" Athen√¶um is also used in reference to schools and literary clubs. The closest English translation is academy, referring to institutions of secondary learning. The Ateneo de San Pablo is not the only Jesuit school in the Philippines that the Jesuits named Ateneo. The Society of Jesus has established 16 schools all over the Philippines since 1590. Nine of them were given the name Ateneo. Ateneo de Pablo was the sixth school named Ateneo. Over the years, the name \\"Ateneo\\" has become synonymous with academic excellence. School seal left 150px The first is the official seal of the school. Ateneo de San Pablo's seal is different from the school seals of the other Ateneos which all have the shield of the family of St. Ignatius of Loyola. School colors and mascot The school colors of Ateneo de San Pablo were purple and white, while its mascot was the Purple Panther.

It was based on the story \\"You Scream, I Scream, We All Scream for Ice Cream\\" by John Farris; the title evoking the famous song \\"I Scream, You Scream, We All Scream for Ice Cream\\". Plot The story starts off with a father, named Kent, pleading for his young son not to eat an ice cream cone, but to no availthe ice cream is eaten and Kent shockingly dissolves into a puddle of melted ice cream. At Kent's funeral, one of his childhood friends Layne Banixter attends. While there, Layne observes a shaggy individual hiding back in the trees, smirking. While Layne is at a pub, his friend, Toot, is drinking himself into a stupor. Toot claims that Kent was in a closed casket because there was nothing left of him but his clothes. He insists that Layne's moving back to town has created bad luck for everyone. Around midnight, Layne heads home and observes several children in a trance, standing outside, clutching coins with an eerie chant of \\"We all scream for ice cream...\\". Worried, Layne goes to bed. His wife is concerned at his distant behavior, and she urges him to tell her what's wrong. Layne tells his wife of his childhood, and the local ice-cream man named Buster Dawkins. He was a decent soul who drove an ice-cream truck and wore a clown suit. The neighborhood bully, Virgil Constance had pulled off his clown nose to reveal a burnt stub ‚Äì Buster had no real nose. Layne ends the story there, stating that one day, Buster simply died. He gets a phone call and arrives at the scene of Toot's death ‚Äì his clothes in a pile of something gooey. Layne's wife demands to know what part of the story he omitted. Distressed, Layne tells her that Virgil planned a prank on Buster that one of them would release the brake on his truck and make it roll down the hill. Virgil forced Layne to pull the brake, and the truck began rolling straight towards Buster. Too busy picking up fallen coins to notice, Buster was run over by the truck and killed. That night, Layne goes to see the adult Virgil ‚Äì the shaggy man he spotted at the funeral. Virgil eventually tells Layne about Buster: that the clown has returned for revenge for their fatal prank. While they are talking, a ghostly ice-cream truck stops nearby in front of a little girl whom Virgil had molested. Buster reaches out of his truck to her, and his horribly-scabbed hand gives the girl a treat. He tells her she can use it to get revenge. Upon the girl biting into it, Virgil melts away, screaming as layers of skin and flesh strips off him like ice-cream. Layne returns home with a plan. He begs his wife to take their children away to their grandmother's house for one day while he fixes things. After they leave, he tests the garden devices with a remote, then uses ice cream from a bucket in the freezer to create a shape. He wraps the treat with one of Buster's wrappers that Layne had thrown away. Layne hears the creepy tune and, carrying a small cooler, walks outside for a showdown. His children, lured by Buster from the car a short distance away, run to them. Buster's vengeful spirit offers an ice-cream (shaped like Layne) to Layne's kids. Layne and Buster struggle until Layne turns on the garden sprinklers, freezing the clown. Layne's son sees the ice-cream treat Layne had dropped, and it's shaped exactly like Buster. The boy bites into it and the clown dies. In the next scene, everything appears normal again and the family is about to move away from that town, but suddenly Layne hears the old creepy tune again and the film ends with a flash of Buster's rotten face.

Background Following the successful defeat of the Maratha Empire in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the East India Company was able to expand its operations westwards largely unchecked.Joe Bindloss, Northeast India, Lonely Planet, 2009, page 31 This created a new frontier for the company which brought them into competition with the expanding Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. At the same time, Russia was empire building in Asia, and the British government became fearful of the Russian threats to its commercial interests in India and central Asia. The British viewed Afghanistan as a potential protectorate, behind a series of further buffer states in central Asia and Persia designed to protect British India. However to gain access to Afghanistan, a route would be required through Sind and the Punjab.Edward Ingram. The International History Review, Vol. 2, No. 2 (Apr., 1980), pp. 160-171.

Britain's forgotten wars. Sutton Publishing Ltd. , page 546 To counter the threat to British territories along the border, the East India Company increased its military strength near the border with a new cantonment in Ferozepur. However this act, viewed together with the recent conquest of Sindh in 1843, was viewed with great distrust by the Sikhs.Farwell, Byron (1973). Queen Victoria's little wars. Wordsworth Editions. , page 30 This led to a breakdown in diplomatic relations and the outbreak of the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1845. The British marched unopposed into Lahore on 20 February 1846 and a peace treaty, known as the Treaty of Lahore was drawn up by Frederick Currie. A supplement to the treaty stipulated that a British force would remain in Lahore until no longer than the end of the year \\"for the purpose of protecting the person of the Maharajah and the inhabitants of the City of Lahore, during the reorganisation of the Sikh Army.Article 1 to 4 of the supplementary Agreement Towards the end of 1846, the Treaty Of Bhyrowal was ratified, which provided that a Resident British officer, with an efficient establishment of assistants, was to be appointed by the Governor-General to remain at Lahore, with \\"full authority to direct and control all matters in every Department of the State\\".Article 2 of the Treaty of Bhyroval Paladins of the Punjaub The new Resident was to be Henry Lawrence, who had assisted Currie in the drafting of the Lahore Treaty. Lawrence would subsequently hand pick a number of assistants to carry out his orders. These included contemporaries such as James Abbott, Frederick Mackeson and his brothers George Lawrence and John Lawrence, however the majority were junior officers in their twenties taken directly from the Bengal Army.Charles Allen, Soldier Sahibs: The Men Who Made the North-West Frontier, Hachette UK, 21 Jun 2012 Some of the most prominent officers selected by Lawrence, were those he had served with in the First Anglo-Sikh War.

Writing in the Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle said, \\"Though up-scale for a Troma release, this is still unbearably tedious and awful, to be avoided by any expedient.\\" Dendle writes that although the film does not have traditional Romero-style zombies, the voodoo ceremony raises what seems to be Haitian zombie.

Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/flm.2004.0015 Plot The warrior Deathstalker is sent by a witch on a quest to find a chalice, an amulet, and a sword, two of which are held by the wicked sorcerer Munkar (Bernard Erhard). Deathstalker finds the sword almost immediately, which has been hidden by the witch in a cave guarded by an ogre and an imp. The imp Salmaron reveals himself to be a thief cursed by the witch and aids Deathstalker in defeating the ogre. Deathstalker removes the curse from Salmaron and the thief agrees to accompany Deathstalker on his journey. Sword in hand, Deathstalker sets out to Munkar's castle to gain the remaining objects of power. On his journey, Deathstalker learns of a tournament from Oghris (Richard Brooker), a charming warrior. Munkar has invited warriors across the land to participate in contests until a winner is determined - the winner will inherit Munkar's kingdom. One night along the way to the tournament, the pair meet Kaira, a defiant female warrior (Lana Clarkson) who wears only a G-string and a cloak. Later that night Deathstalker has sex with her. Salmaron looks on with amusement at the pair. Kaira joins the group on their journey the next morning. Munkar reveals to his assistant that his true agenda is for the warriors to fight each other to the death until only a weakened survivor remains for Munkar to kill. This would remove all threats to his rule. Arriving at Munkar's castle, Deathstalker and the other participants gather in Munkar's banquet room the night before the tournament. The warriors are invited to get drunk and rape Munkar's harem slaves, including Princess Codille (Barbi Benton). Oghris connects with one slave girl while Kaira keeps Deathstalker to herself. Deathstalker rescues Princess Codille, briefly, but Munkar takes her back. Munkar transforms his assistant into the likeness of the Princess and sends him to kill the hero; when Deathstalker attempts to rape Codille, he discovers that the woman is not all \\"woman\\" and sends her away. Kaira finds the assassin; assuming she is the real Codille, she is tragically killed by the assassin in a sword fight after Munkar's disguise spell wears off. The night after the first day of the tournament, Oghris is taken by Munkar's men to a prison cell while Salmaron is attacked by prison guards. The thief is knocked into a well that leads to Munkar's harem. It is revealed that Oghris brought Deathstalker to the tournament expressly for Munkar and he is ordered to kill him. Reluctant to kill his friend, Oghris warns Deathstalker and asks the hero to just leave the tournament but Deathstalker refuses and attacks him. During the brawl, Oghris has the chance to draw the sword and kill Deathstalker but chooses to fight fairly and ultimately loses. Deathstalker says goodbye to the fighter and kills him. The last day of the tournament arrives and there are only two competitors left - Deathstalker and an ogre. After a long fight, Deathstalker kills the ogre and moves to claim his prize. He is attacked by Munkar's men but makes his way to the amulet. Salmaron is discovered in the harem room but frees the women and helps them slay the guards. Deathstalker defeats the holder of the amulet and faces Munkar; he is able to defeat the sorcerer's illusions and claims the third object of power. Deathstalker declares he has no interest in Munkar's power or kingdom - he destroys the three objects of power and throws Munkar to a crowd of slaves who tear him apart. Cast Production The film was shot on location and at Aries Studios in Buenos Aires. Reception =Box office= Deathstalker was a modest hit at the box office, and its success was mostly due to its release at a time when Conan the Barbarian was creating a market for sword and sorcery films while also having a tight budget. The film was also popular on video. The video version of the film became a staple during the fledgling days of cable television and video rentals.THE CURRENT HITS Hunt, Dennis.

Ohorn is a governmentally accredited recreation locality.  Geography and infrastructure  The municipality is located 2 km east of Pulsnitz and 30 km to the northeast of Dresden, the capital of Saxony. Embedded in the valley of the River Pulsnitz, Ohorn is surrounded by the typical landscape of the western Lusatian Hills, reaching a height of 449 m at the Hochstein Hill. Ohorn, having its own exit can be reached by using the A4 federal autobahn.  Local subdivision  Ohorn is divided into 5 parts: Fuchsbelle, Gickelsberg, Mitteldorf, Oberdorf and R√∂der.  Historical development  Following German Teutonic knights' call, in 1110 craftsmen, manufacturers and farmers from Thuringia, Franconia, Hesse and Bavaria came to settle in the area of the river Pulsnitz valley, creating a settlement of approximately on the southwestern side of the Schlei√überg Hill, the river being an important factor in the location of the settlement. Ohorn was first mentioned in historical documents in 1349 in the Book of Feuds owned by Frederick III, Landgrave of Thuringia, bearing the name \\"Ahorn\\", which stands for \\"Settlement by the maple tree/wood\\" Historisches Ortsnamenbuch von Sachsen. Bd. II, M-Z. Berlin: Akademie-Verlag 2001, S. 132 In 1537, Ohorn Manor was mentioned as an estate of the rule of Pulsnitz. Today, only parts of the country house, now giving space to a residential care home, and several buildings converted into housing establishments remain as well as the English style park. In those times, there were no important steps of development in Ohorn, its status as a farmer's settlement persisted because the state borders of the diocese of Mei√üen and the Bohemian Kingdom took course through the settlement, exposing it to recurrent raids and warfare throughout the centuries. In addition, the number of inhabitants was decimated by epidemics; the plague resulted in the death of a fifth of the population. In 1661, the ruling Knights of the Ohorn Manor approved the construction of a school building. The first school building to be recorded was established in 1750. Beginning in 1745, a drastic social change took place, since Michael Prescher introduced a ribbon weaving mill. Due to its development into an industrially shaped locality, Ohorn's demographics evolved accordingly: in 1885, there were 2000 people living in the settlement. With increasing numbers of cottage weavers, better looms were required, leading to the establishment of the loom manufacturing business C.H. Sch√§fer, which now produces machine parts and is one of Ohorn's largest employers. In 1827 and 1879, new school buildings were established. The first bus connection to the surrounding areas was established in 1912 by the smith Bernhard Mocke's postal stage bus, being the first one in Saxony, connecting the two cities of Pulsnitz and K√∂nigsbr√ºck. The Upper Guesthouse of Ohorn was reestablished as the city hall in 1925. Five years later, the former manor's steam mill was converted into the Betsaal, a hall. The Gymnastics Club of Ohorn has existed since 1865. The same year, a choir was established, but no longer exists.

This technology has proven to be effective at identifying and comparing digital video data. Compared to digital watermarking Video fingerprinting should not be confused with digital watermarking, which relies on inserting identifying features into the content and therefore changing the content. Some watermarks can be inserted in a way that they are imperceptible by a viewer. A robust watermark can be difficult to detect and remove, but removal of invisible watermarks is a significant weakness. Since watermarks must be inserted into the video, they only identify copies of the particular video made after that point in time. For example, if a watermark is inserted at broadcast it cannot be used to identify copies of the video made before the broadcast. Video fingerprinting does not rely on any addition to the video stream. A video fingerprint cannot be \\"removed\\", because it is not \\"added\\". In addition, a reference video fingerprint can be created at any point, from any copy of the video.Content Control: Digital Watermarking and Fingerprinting Watermarks offer some advantages over fingerprinting. A unique watermark can be added to the content at any stage in the distribution process, and multiple independent watermarks can be inserted into the same video content. This can be particularly useful in tracing the history of a copy of a video. Detecting watermarks in a video can indicate the source of an unauthorized copy. While video fingerprinting systems must search a potentially large database of reference fingerprints, a watermark detection system only has to do the computation to detect the watermark. This computation can be significant, and when multiple watermark keys must be tested, then watermarking can fail to scale to the volumes required by commercial applications such as user generated video services. Applications = Rights management and distribution tracking = Video fingerprinting is of interest in the Digital Rights Management (DRM) area, particularly regarding the distribution of unauthorized content on the Internet. Video fingerprinting systems enable content providers (e.g., film studios) or publishers (e.g., user-generated content (UGC) sites) to determine if any of the publisher's files contain content registered with the fingerprint service. If registered content is detected, the publisher can take the appropriate action ‚Äì remove it from the site, monetize it, add correct attribution, etc. Video fingerprinting may be used for broadcast monitoring (e.g., advertisement monitoring, news monitoring) and general media monitoring. Broadcast monitoring solutions can inform content providers and content owners with playlists of when and where their video content has been used. A typical application is described in this Video Fingerprinting Use Case for Television Productions and Broadcasters. Fingerprinting visual content is similar in overall concept to audio fingerprinting but uses a different technology. From a content provider's point of view, both video and audio fingerprinting need to be used in most applications. Consider the online publication of \\"mash-ups\\". Mash-ups can consist of content from several sources that are compiled together and are set to a unique audio track. Since the audio track is different from the original version, the copyrighted material in these mash-ups would go undetected using only audio fingerprinting techniques. In other cases, mash-ups consist of the soundtrack from a commercial video source, like a movie, used with a different video stream. In this case, a video fingerprint would not match, but an audio fingerprint would. When the audio and video streams are not from the same masterwork, the question of fair use may arise. This discrepancy has real applications in the global online community in terms of film distribution. Films shown in countries other than their country of origin are often dubbed into other languages. This change in audio renders the films virtually unrecognizable by audio fingerprinting technologies unless copies of all known versions have been fingerprinted. Employing video fingerprinting, however, enables the content owner to fingerprint just once and have each subsequent version remain recognizable. If the customer wishes to know which language soundtrack is present on a particular video, then an audio fingerprint must be used. Another use is for companies to track the leak of confidential recordings or videos, or for celebrities to track the presence on the Internet of unauthorized videos (for instance, videos of themselves taken by amateurs using a camcorder or a mobile phone). = Interactive media = Video fingerprinting within Smart TV is enabling an emerging category of interactive television applications. Television devices integrated with real-time fingerprinting software can automatically recognize the video content on- screen in order to enable interactive features and applications on top of the programming. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban has made investments to leverage this technology to create interactive features for his cable networks HDNet and its successor AXS.Mark Cuban flings funding at Flingo - CNET Video fingerprints can also be used to create content-aware video advertising. As one implementation, if a video service provider distributes content that contains a nationally broadcast TV commercial, a localized overlay of text/graphics may be performed on the national commercial. This way, the national commercial will have a local overlay of information specific to that commercial. For example, if the national commercial contains a 15-second spot for a Ford Explorer SUV, through the fingerprint technology, local operators may put an overlay of local dealership information ‚Äì phone number, promotion, etc. ‚Äì over the 15-second commercial, creating a localized commercial for the SUV that appears to be targeted only at the local audience. = Criminal investigation = Video fingerprinting is also used by authorities to track the distribution of illegal content such as happy slapping, terrorist, and child abuse related videos. In April 2014 the British company Friend MTS Ltd. donated its video fingerprinting technology (known as F1) to the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) to help increase the efficiency of child pornography investigations, and to halt the continued sharing of similar files over the internet. ICMEC distributes the technology to law enforcement agencies, software providers, and online service providers to hinder the spread of such material.

A Randles circuit is an equivalent electrical circuit that consists of an active electrolyte resistance RS in series with the parallel combination of the double-layer capacitance Cdl and an impedance of a faradaic reaction. It is commonly used in Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for interpretation of impedance spectra, often with a Constant phase element (CPE) replacing the double layer capacity (Cdl). The Randles equivalent circuit is one of the simplest possible models describing processes at the electrochemical interface. In real electrochemical systems, impedance spectra are usually more complicated and, thus, the Randles circuit may not give appropriate results. Explanation Figure 1 shows the equivalent circuit initially proposed by John Edward Brough Randles for modeling of interfacial electrochemical reactions in presence of semi-infinite linear diffusion of electroactive particles to flat electrodes. In this model, the impedance of a faradaic reaction consists of an active charge transfer resistance Rct and a specific electrochemical element of diffusion W, which is also called Warburg element (ZW = AW/(jœâ)0.5, where AW is Warburg coefficient, j ‚Äì imaginary unit, œâ ‚Äì angular frequency). Simulated EIS spectrum of the Randles circuit. Identifying the Warburg element In a simple situation, the Warburg element manifests itself in EIS spectra by a line with an angle of 45 degrees in the low frequency region. Figure 2 shows an example of EIS spectrum (presented in the Nyquist plot) simulated using the following parameters: RS = 20 Œ©, Cdl = 25 ŒºF, Rct = 100 Œ©, AW = 300 Œ©‚Ä¢s‚àí0.5. Values of the charge transfer resistance and Warburg coefficient depend on physico- chemical parameters of a system under investigation. To obtain the Randles circuit parameters, the fitting of the model to the experimental data should be performed using complex nonlinear least-squares procedures available in numerous EIS data fitting computer programs.

An accomplished industrial and interior designer, he was also active in the fields of graphics and exhibitions. His wife Lucienne Day, n√©e Conradi (1917‚Äì2010) was a renowned textile designer. The couple married in 1942 and had one daughter, Paula Day (born 1954). Career =Early life, Education and Marriage= Robin Day grew up in the furniture-making town of High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. High Wycombe Technical Institute, where he was a junior day student, had close links with the local furniture industry. Being gifted at drawing, Day progressed to High Wycombe School of Art in 1931 and then won a scholarship to study design at the Royal College of Art in 1934. On leaving the RCA in 1938, there were no suitable openings in the furniture industry, so he made architectural models and took a teaching post at Beckenham School of Art, where he developed a ground-breaking course in 3D design. Day met his future wife, Lucienne Conradi, in 1940 at a dance at the RCA, where she was studying printed textile design. They married in 1942, moving into a flat in Chelsea. In 1952 the couple moved to a house on Cheyne Walk, their home and joint studio for the next 50 years. =Early Post-War Design Career (1945-50)= Jet exhibition, 1946 After the Second World War, Robin Day taught interior design at the Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster), where he met the architect Peter Moro (1911-1998). The two men formed a partnership in 1946 designing public information exhibitions, mainly for the Central Office of Information and other government organisations, on subjects such as jet engines and scientific instruments. Day continued designing exhibitions and trade stands until the early 1960s for clients such as the radio manufacturer EKCO and the industrial giant ICI. A talented graphic designer, he also designed an eye-catching series of recruitment posters for the RAF during 1948‚Äì9. Although the war had impeded Day's ambition to become a furniture designer, his fortunes changed in 1948 when he and Clive Latimer won First Prize in the Storage Section of the International Competition for Low-Cost Furniture Design organised by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Their ingenious concept for a range of multi-purpose storage units fabricated from a tube of pre-formed moulded plywood received international acclaim. Although never mass-produced, a set of prototypes made by Heal & Son in 1949 demonstrated the principles behind the design. Supported on tubular aluminium legs, the cabinets were compact and flexible, with sliding doors, interchangeable shelf and drawer fittings and a writing desk with a drop-down flap. Day's success in the MOMA competition brought him to the attention of Rosamind Julius and her husband of the S. Hille & Co., a small London furniture firm keen to branch out into modern design. The prize was also instrumental in securing an important commission to design the seating for the Royal Festival Hall in 1951, another major breakthrough in his career. =Festival of Britain and Royal Festival Hall (1951)= 1951 was an annus mirabilis for Robin Day. His seating for the Royal Festival Hall and his high- profile contributions to the Festival of Britain, held on the neighbouring site on London's South Bank, greatly enhanced his professional reputation. The brief for the Royal Festival Hall project was complex and demanding, including restaurant and foyer furniture, auditorium seating and orchestra chairs, each with specific functional requirements. Always keen to explore new manufacturing processes, Day co-opted materials and technology from the automotive industry for his concert hall seating, which was fabricated from pressed steel, supported by cast steel stanchions. This proved so effective that it is still in use today. The chairs he designed for the restaurant and foyer had sculptural moulded plywood seats with wing-like armrests and spindly black steel rod legs. Day was the first designer in Britain to exploit these materials in furniture. Day's ingenuity was also evident in the two open-plan living room / dining room settings he created for the Homes and Gardens Pavilion at the Festival of Britain. Designed to illustrate what could be achieved on different budgets, both rooms were equipped with his Royal Festival Hall chairs, along with newly designed storage units. The economy cabinets were in oak, while the luxury cabinets were made from veneered mahogany on a frame of square-section tubular steel. The Festival acted as a valuable platform for launching Robin Day's pared down 'Contemporary' aesthetic, which was also showcased at the Milan Triennale in 1951. Architects were particularly enthusiastic about his furniture as it was ideally suited to the clean-lined, glass-walled modern buildings that were coming into fashion after the war, not only in the domestic sphere but in the public and commercial domain. =Furniture Designs for Hille (1950s)= Robin Day began designing for S. Hille & Co. ‚Äì a small cabinet-making firm specialising mainly in high-quality reproduction furniture ‚Äì in 1949. The company was run by Ray Hille (1900-1986), daughter of Salamon Hille, who had established the company in 1906. At Day's instigation ‚Äì and with the support of Ray's daughter Rosamind Julius (1923-2010) and son-in-law Leslie Julius, who had recently joined the firm ‚Äì the company underwent a complete transformation and became a champion of modern design. Although Day was never formally employed by Hille, preferring to act as a design consultant, he became their chief designer in effect. The partnership proved so successful that, for the next 20 years, he created most of Hille's designs. Right from the start, his primary aim was the marriage between functionalism and technology. The utilitarian Hillestak Chair (1951), a stacking chair with a beech plywood seat and a solid beech frame, was his first mass-produced design. His Hilleplan (1953) and Interplan Units (1955) marked a logical progression from the storage systems created for the Festival of Britain. Both were modular, so that multiple units could be combined in coordinated groups. Like many of his designs, they were both handsome and practical, making them equally suitable for domestic or contract use. Whereas 1930s furniture had been heavy and ponderous, Day's post-war designs were light on their feet and economical in their use of materials. His Reclining Chair (1952), for example, had a slim angular upholstered seat, floating wooden armrests and U-shaped steel rod legs. A minimalist frame was also adopted for the 675 Chair (1953), a dining chair with a slender floating moulded plywood seat back. In the Q Stak Chair (1954), Day's first one-piece moulded plywood shell chair, the number of components was reduced to the bare minimum in order to keep costs down. Robin Day continued to expand Hille's furniture collections throughout the 1950s, pioneering technical innovations such as frames made of flat bar steel or square-section tubular steel. His Single Convertible Bed Settee (1957), with its lightweight foam cushions and simple swing-down wooden seat back, characterised the elegant flexibility of his designs. Day was a great advocate of Pirelli rubber webbing, which he adopted as a replacement for traditional coil-sprung upholstery. In fact, he admired it to such a degree that he left it exposed as a decorative feature on several designs, including the Gatwick Chair (1958), created for Gatwick Airport, and a modular seating system called the Form Group (1960), one of several Design Centre Award winners. =Polypropylene Chair= Polypropylene side chairs, 1964 Robin Day is best known for his injection-moulded Polypropylene Chair, originally designed in 1963 for the firm of S. Hille & Co. and still in production today by its successor Hille Educational Products. Polypropylene seating at Mexico Olympics 1968 The first mass-produced injection-moulded polypropylene shell chair in the world, it represented a major breakthrough in furniture design and technology. Originally created as a stacking chair, it was adapted for a variety of applications, ranging from airports to sports stadiums. Tens of millions of Polypropylene Chairs have been produced over the last 50 years. In 2009 it was selected by Royal Mail to appear on a postage stamp as one of eight designs in a 2009 series celebrating \\"British Design Classics\\". =Polypropylene Chair Family (1963-1975)= E-series School chairs, 1971 Both the Polypropylene Chair and the Polypropylene Armchair (1967) were designed to accommodate a wide range of different bases. Day later created a range of lightweight polypropylene shell chairs for schools called Series E (1971), produced in five different sizes with an oval hole in the back. His Polo Chair (1975) with its distinctive drainage/ventilation holes was another important addition to the Polypropylene Chair family. Designed for outdoors as well as inside, the Polo Chair was widely used for stadium seating, a specialist field in which Day became increasingly involved. He also experimented with other plastics during the 1960s and 70s, as well as continuing to refine his furniture designs in wood and steel. Examples from 1973 can be seen in the nave seating at Clifton Cathedral, Bristol.Historic England. \\"Details from listed building database (1271209)\\". National Heritage List for England. Retrieved 28 September 2015. =Industrial Design and Interiors (1940s-1970s)= TV for Pye, 1965 Robin Day was a man of many talents and worked in an unusually wide range of disciplines. Apart from Hille, his two principal industrial clients were the electronics firm Pye, for whom he designed radios and televisions from c.1948-65, and the carpet manufacturer Woodward Grosvenor, for whom he created abstract designs for wilton carpets from c.1960-66. Day continued to collaborate with leading architects on custom-designed furniture for new buildings. In 1964 he designed the oiled teak refectory tables and chairs for the main dining hall at Churchill College, Cambridge, designed by Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners. His largest and most ambitious commission was the seating for the Barbican Arts Centre, designed by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, completed in 1981. This massive project, which occupied him throughout the 1970s, included auditorium seating for the theatre, concert hall and three cinemas, as well as caf√© tables and chairs and long snaking sofas for the foyers. =Design Consultancy for John Lewis Partnership and BOAC (1940s-1970s)= Robin Day with model of John Lewis restaurant, 1973 Although Robin and Lucienne Day shared a studio, they mainly worked in their own spheres, apart from two occasions when they collaborated as joint design consultants to the John Lewis Partnership and BOAC. For the latter they designed interiors for the company's fleet of Super VC10 aircraft during the 1960s. Robin later developed a prototype refreshment tray and tableware for Concorde, although this was never produced. The Days' involvement with the John Lewis Partnership was substantial and prolonged as they were engaged as joint design consultants for 25 years between 1962 and 1987. One of their main achievements at JLP was helping to develop a comprehensive new house style, covering everything from in-store signage and product packaging to company stationery and liveries for vans. Robin also designed the interiors of several Waitrose supermarkets and John Lewis department stores, notably Milton Keynes in 1979. =Later Designs, Awards and Reissues (1980s ‚Äì 2000s)= Toro bench, 1990 Public seating had been one of Robin Day's specialities since 1956 when he was asked to design a heavy-duty bench for British Rail. Three and a half decades later, he was invited to design a range of seating for use on London Underground stations. His super-strong perforated steel Toro Bench (1990) is still widely used today, along with a timber variant called Woodro (1991). These attractive, comfortable and hard-wearing benches are amongst his most familiar and ubiquitous designs. During the late 1990s Robin Day's work was championed by Tom Dixon, former Creative Director of Habitat. As well as selling the Polypropylene Chair, Habitat reissued new versions of two of Day's earlier designs, the Forum Settee (1964) in 1999 and the 675 Chair (1952) in 2000. These reissues triggered wider interest in Day's post-war designs and prompted commissions from several other firms, including SCP, twentywentyone and the Italian company Magis. Since Robin Day's death in 2010, the responsibility for licensing his designs has been taken over by the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation, established by Paula Day in 2012.Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation website Robin Day received many honours over the course of his long career. He was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1959 and appointed an OBE in 1983. He was a past winner of the Chartered Society of Designers' highest accolade, the Minerva Medal, awarded for lifetime achievement in the field of design. In close collaboration with the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation, Case Furniture revisited the original design of the 675 Chair and faithfully reinstated, in the 2014 chair, the element and detail of the 1952 original. Design philosophy Robin Day's early designs reflected the optimistic, forward-looking mood of the post-war era. 'To many of us then, design was more than just a profession ‚Äì we were dedicated, competitive and filled with evangelical zeal,‚Äô he later recalled. 'In my long years of designing, the thing that has always interested me is the social context of design and designing things that are good quality that most people can afford,‚Äô he observed in 1999. 'It was always my mission to mass-produce low-cost seating, because I do think that clarity and what we call \\"good design\\" is a social force that can enhance people's environments. Day's democratic ideals and social purpose were reiterated by Fiona MacCarthy: 'His great aim was to make good design available all over the world, at prices affordable to ordinary people.... He was hugely impressed by the scope of design in Scandinavia. It was part of his emerging philosophy that the designer should influence all details of daily life, and he worked in graphics, exhibitions and interiors as well as designing products.' Day's inventive use of new technology, sparing use of materials and economical approach to construction stemmed from the austerity of the war years, when materials and labour were in short supply. 'Metal for strength and lightness, rubber for comfort and efficiency, wood for touch and appearance,‚Äô was how he summarised his preferences in 1959. These habits became deeply ingrained in his design psyche and, even in more affluent times, his approach to design was always resourceful and down-to-earth. 'Throughout his life he loved working with his hands,‚Äô noted Lesley Jackson. 'His workshop became an essential adjunct to his design studio, as it was here that he fine-tuned the models for his production furniture. Minutely concerned with every technical and ergonomic detail, his approach to design was always very direct and hands-on.' Day was a deeply moral and highly principled designer who shied away from showiness or opulence. His aim was to solve practical problems in the most rigorous, efficient and cost-effective way. 'A good design must fulfil its purpose well, be soundly constructed, and should express in its design this purpose and construction,‚Äô he stated simply in Ideal Home in June 1962. Right from the start of his career, he was instinctively opposed to the idea of egotism in design and novelty for novelty's sake: 'It seems that the creation of new furniture has sometimes become almost entirely a vehicle of self- expression for the designer, or a seasonal quick-change act for the marketing requirements of manufacturers,‚Äô he reflected in 1953. 'No one would pretend that material, technical needs and function were the sole dictates of form, but it is evident that in some of the finest furniture of our time, technology on the one hand and superlative craftsmanship on the other, have played a major role. I think that general acceptance of modern furniture depends largely on sincerity of design.'Robin Day, 'Robin Day', Everyday Art Quarterly, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, no.28, 1953 He continued to uphold these principles throughout his life: 'To produce things which are merely new and not better is really evil,‚Äô he declared in 1999. 'Things should be made because they are better and with regard to the limited resources of the planet, so they should be re-usable and long-lasting. People often think that mere newness is innovation, but it isn't.' Resources =Exhibitions and Books= Robin and Lucienne Day's post-war design achievements were brought back into the limelight in 1991 in a major international exhibition called The New Look: Design in the Fifties at Manchester City Art Gallery. Ten years later their careers were examined in depth in a comprehensive retrospective exhibition called Robin and Lucienne Day: Pioneers of Contemporary Design at the Barbican Centre, London in 2001. Both exhibitions were curated by design historian by Lesley Jackson, who also wrote the accompanying books. Robin Day's furniture has also been documented in Modern British Furniture: Design Since 1945 by Lesley Jackson, published by the V&A; in 2013. These books, based on extensive archive research and interviews with the designers, provide the primary source of information about Robin and Lucienne Day's careers. An exhibition of Lucienne Day's textiles and Robin Day's furniture, \\"Robin and Lucienne Day: Design and the Modern Interior\\", was held between 26 March and 26 June 2011 at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester. The Days' work was also featured in a large exhibition at the V&A; Museum in 2012 called British Design From 1948: Innovation in the Modern Age. In 2015 The Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation celebrated Robin Day's centenary year with the exhibition Robin Day Works in Wood, which was shown at the V&A; Museum as part of the London Design Festival. =Film= A documentary film called Contemporary Days: The Designs of Robin and Lucienne Day, directed by Murray Grigor for Design Onscreen, was completed shortly before Robin Day's death in 2010. The film was premiered at the Royal Society of Arts in the presence of Robin Day in an auditorium furnished with the designer's seating.

The twenty-five letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity. Published by Wollstonecraft's career-long publisher, Joseph Johnson, it was the last work issued during her lifetime. Wollstonecraft undertook her tour of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark in order to retrieve a stolen treasure ship for her lover, Gilbert Imlay. Believing that the journey would restore their strained relationship, she eagerly set off. However, over the course of the three months she spent in Scandinavia, she realized that Imlay had no intention of renewing the relationship. The letters, which constitute the text, drawn from her journal and from missives she sent to Imlay, reflect her anger and melancholy over his repeated betrayals. Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is therefore both a travel narrative and an autobiographical memoir. Using the rhetoric of the sublime, Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between self and society in the text. She values subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature; champions the liberation and education of women; and illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society. Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was Wollstonecraft's most popular book in the 1790s‚Äîit sold well and was reviewed favorably by most critics. Wollstonecraft's future husband, philosopher William Godwin, wrote: \\"If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book.\\"Godwin, 95. It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic. While the book initially inspired readers to travel to Scandinavia, it failed to retain its popularity after the publication of Godwin's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1798, which revealed Wollstonecraft's unorthodox private life. Biographical background John Opie, Mary Wollstonecraft, (c. 1797) In 1790, at the age of thirty-one, Wollstonecraft made a dramatic entrance onto the public stage with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a work that helped propel the British pamphlet war over the French revolution. Two years later she published what has become her most famous work, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Anxious to see the revolution firsthand, she moved to France for about two years, but returned in 1795 after revolutionary violence increased and the lover she met there, American adventurer Gilbert Imlay, abandoned her and their illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay. Shortly after her return to Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted suicide in May; Imlay, however, managed to save her. One month after her attempted suicide, Wollstonecraft agreed to undertake the long and treacherous journey to Scandinavia in order to resolve Imlay's business difficulties. Not only was her journey to Scandinavia fraught with peril (she was a woman travelling alone during a time of war), it was also laced with sorrow and anger. While Wollstonecraft initially believed that the trip might resurrect their relationship, she eventually recognized that it was doomed, particularly after Imlay failed to meet her in Hamburg.Jacobus, 64; 68; Holmes, 18. Wollstonecraft's despair increased as her journey progressed. On her return to Britain in September, Wollstonecraft tried to commit suicide a second time: she attempted to drown herself in the River Thames but was rescued by passersby.Jacobus, 64. Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, which draws its material from her journal and the letters she sent Imlay during the three-month tour, was published in by Wollstonecraft's close friend and career-long publisher, Joseph Johnson. Written after her two suicide attempts, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark frequently returns to the topic of death; it recreates Wollstonecraft's mental state while she was in Scandinavia and has been described as a suicide note addressed to Imlay, although he is never referred to by name in the published text.Swaab, 19. It is the last work by Wollstonecraft published within her lifetime: she died in childbirth just one year later. =Scandinavian journey and Imlay's business interests= Although Wollstonecraft appears as only a tourist in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, during her travels she was actually conducting delicate business negotiations on behalf of Imlay. For almost two hundred years, it was unclear why she had travelled to Scandinavia, but in the 1980s historian Per Nystr√∂m uncovered documents in local Swedish and Norwegian archives that shed light on the purpose of her trip. He revealed that Wollstonecraft was searching for a ship and cargo that had been stolen from Imlay. Imlay had authorized her to conduct his business dealings, referring to her in legal documents as \\"Mrs. Mary Imlay, my best friend and wife\\", although the two were not married.Nystr√∂m, 18. Wollstonecraft's route The intricate details of Imlay's business dealings are laid out clearly by Nystr√∂m. On 1794, Peder Ellefsen, who belonged to a rich and influential Norwegian family, bought a ship called the Liberty from agents of Imlay in Le Havre, France. It would later become clear that Ellefsen never owned the ship but rather engaged in a pro-forma sale on behalf of Imlay. He renamed the ship the Maria and Margaretha (presumably after Mary and her maid Marguerite) and had the Danish Consulate in Le Havre certify it so that the ship could pass through the British blockade of France (Imlay was a blockade runner). Carrying silver and gold Bourbon plate, the ship sailed from France under a Danish flag and arrived at Copenhagen on 1794. Although Ellefsen supposedly ordered the ship to continue on to Gothenburg, it never reached its destination. Imlay engaged in several fruitless attempts to locate the ship and its valuable cargo and then dispatched Wollstonecraft to negotiate an agreement with Ellefsen, who had subsequently been arrested for stealing the ship and its contents. Wollstonecraft's success or failure in the negotiations is unknown as is the ultimate fate of the ship and its treasure.Nystr√∂m, 22ff. To engage in these negotiations, Wollstonecraft travelled first to Gothenburg, where she remained for two weeks. Leaving Fanny and her nurse Marguerite behind, she embarked for Str√∂mstad, Sweden, where she took a short detour to visit the fortress of Fredriksten, and then proceeded to Larvik, Norway. From there she travelled to T√∏nsberg, Norway, where she spent three weeks. She also visited Helgeroa, Ris√∏r, and Kristiania (now Oslo) and returned by way of Str√∂mstad and Gothenburg, where she picked up Fanny and Marguerite again. She returned to England by way of Copenhagen and Hamburg, finally landing at Dover in September 1795, three months after she had left her home country.Nystr√∂m 9‚Äì10. Structure, genre, and style Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark consists of twenty-five letters that address an extensive range of contentious political topics, such as prison reform, land rights, and divorce laws, as well as less controversial subjects, such as gardening, salt works, and sublime vistas. Wollstonecraft's political commentary extends the ideas she had presented in An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution (1794); her discussion of prison reform, for example, is informed by her own experiences in revolutionary France and those of her friends, many of whom were jailed.Holmes, 26; Swaab, 22‚Äì23. While at first glance Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark appears to be a travel narrative, it is actually a \\"generic hybrid\\". The nature of this hybridity, however, is not altogether agreed upon by scholars. Some emphasize Wollstonecraft's fusion of the travelogue with the autobiography or memoir (a word used by Wollstonecraft in the book's advertisement),Myers, 166; Swaab, 16. while others see it as a travelogue cum epistolary novel.Swaab, 17. The text, which reveals Wollstonecraft's thought processes, flows seamlessly from autobiographical reflections to musings on nature to political theories. However, it is unified by two threads: the first is Wollstonecraft's argument regarding the nature and progress of society; the second is her increasing melancholy.Myers, 166; 170; 181; Holmes, 19; Poovey, 92; Swaab, 25. Although Wollstonecraft aims to write as a philosopher, the image of the suffering woman dominates the book.Kelly, 178; Myers, 171. =Travel narrative: \\"the art of thinking\\"= One-half of the \\"generic hybridity\\" of Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is the epistolary travel narrative.Myers, 169‚Äì70. Wollstonecraft's conception of this genre was shaped by eighteenth-century empirical and moral travel narratives, particularly Oliver Goldsmith's The Traveller, or a Prospect of Society (1764), Laurence Sterne's A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy (1768), Samuel Johnson's A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775), James Boswell's Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides (1785), and Arthur Young's travel books.Myers, 173; Swaab, 17‚Äì18; Kelly, 177; Holmes, 17; Parks, 32. Maurice Quentin de La Tour, Rousseau,(1753) After reviewing twenty- four travel books for Joseph Johnson's periodical, the Analytical Review, Wollstonecraft was well-versed in the genre. This extensive reading solidified her ideas of what constituted a good travel book; in one review, she maintained that travel writers should have \\"some decided point in view, a grand object of pursuit to concentrate their thoughts, and connect their reflections\\" and that their books should not be \\"detached observations, which no running interest, or prevailing bent in the mind of the writer rounds into a whole\\".Qtd. in Swaab, 15; see also, Swaab, 14; Myers, 166; Kelly, 177. Her reviews praised detailed and engaging descriptions of people and places, musings on history, and an insatiable curiosity in the traveller.Swaab, 14; see also Holmes, 32. \\"The art of travel is only a branch of the art of thinking\\", Wollstonecraft wrote.Qtd. in Swaab, 15. Her journey and her comments on it are, therefore, not only sentimental but also philosophical. She uses the two modes to continue the critique of the roles afforded women and the progress of civilization that she had outlined in A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), and An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution.Kelly, 178‚Äì79. After overturning the conventions of political and historical writing, Wollstonecraft brought what scholar Gary Kelly calls \\"Revolutionary feminism\\" to yet another genre that had typically been considered the purview of male writers, transforming the travel narrative's \\"blend of objective facts and individual impressions ... into a rationale for autobiographical revelation\\".Myers, 181. As one editor of the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark writes, the book is \\"nothing less than a revolution in literary genres\\"; its sublimity, expressed through scenes of intense feeling, made \\"a new wildness and richness of emotional rhetoric\\" desirable in travel literature. One scholar has called Wollstonecraft the \\"complete passionate traveler\\".Parks, 33. Her desire to delve into and fully experience each moment in time was fostered by the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, particularly his Reveries of a Solitary Walker (1782).Sapiro, 286‚Äì87; Jacobus, 64; Todd, 368; Favret, 104. Several of Rousseau's themes appear in the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, such as \\"the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding\\".Favret, 104‚Äì106. However, while Rousseau ultimately rejects society, Wollstonecraft celebrates both domesticity and industrial progress. =Letter= In one of the most influential interpretations of Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, Mary Favret has argued that Wollstonecraft's letters must not only be viewed as personal correspondence but also as business correspondence, a genre that would have been ideologically ambiguous for her. According to Favret, Wollstonecraft attempts to reclaim the impersonal genre of the business letter and imbue it with personal meaning. One way she does this is through extensive use of \\"imaginative\\" writing that forces the reader to become a participant in the events narrated. Favret points out that Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is quite different from the despondent and plaintive love letters she actually sent to Imlay; the travel narrative much more closely resembles the personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding the people she encountered and the places she visited. While her letters to Imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively on herself, the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark offers social commentary and sympathizes with the victims of disaster and injustice. To Imlay, Wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts, but to the world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears. She ruminates on them and transforms them into the basis of a letter akin to the open political letter popular during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, using her personal experience as the foundation for a discussion of national political reform.Favret, 96‚Äì98; 101‚Äì2. =Autobiography= Heavily influenced by Rousseau's frank and revealing Confessions (1782), Wollstonecraft lays bare her soul in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, detailing not only her physical but also her psychological journey.Myers, 176; Poovey, 89; Kelly, 187. Her personal disclosures, like those of other female autobiographers, are presented as \\"unpremeditated self-revelations\\" and often appear to be \\"circuitous\\".For a study of female autobiography, see Patricia Meyer Spacks, Imagining a Self. Cambridge: Harvard University Press (1976) and Felicity A. Nussbaum, The Autobiographical Subject: Gender and Ideology in Eighteenth- Century England. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press (1989). However, as Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers has made clear, Wollstonecraft manages to use this style of writing to articulate a stable and comprehensible self for the reader. Increasingly confident in her ability as a writer, she controls the narrative and its effect on readers to a degree not matched in her other works. She transforms the individual sorrows of her trip, such as the dissolution of her relationship with Imlay, into the stuff of gripping literature.Poovey, 85; Todd, 368. =Sublimity= \\"Waterfall\\" by Joseph Anton Koch (1796) Wollstonecraft relies extensively on the language of the sublime in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She draws on and redefines Edmund Burke's central terms in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757). Burke privileges the sublime (which he associates with masculinity, terror, awe, and strength) over the beautiful (which he associates with femininity, passivity, delicacy, and weakness), while Wollstonecraft ties the sublime to sterility and the beautiful to fertility. For her, the beautiful is connected to the maternal; this aesthetic shift is evident, for example, in the many passages focusing on the affectionate tie between Wollstonecraft and little Fanny, her daughter. She thus claims the feminine category of the \\"beautiful\\" for the most virtuous and useful of women: mothers.Moskal, 264; see also 277‚Äì78. Wollstonecraft also revises the conventional negative associations between the sublime and death; thoughts of death, prompted by a waterfall, for example, lead her to contemplate rebirth and immortality as well: > Reaching the cascade, or rather cataract, the roaring of which had a long > time announced its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new > train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from > the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity > in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why > I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this > sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, > with renewed dignity, above its cares ‚Äì grasping at immortality ‚Äì it seemed > as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, > still the same, torrent before me ‚Äì I stretched out my hand to eternity, > bounding over the dark speck of life to come.Wollstonecraft > (Holmes/Penguin), 152‚Äì53. Like her other manipulations of the language of the sublime, this passage is also heavily inflected by gender. As one scholar puts it, \\"because Wollstonecraft is a woman, and is therefore bound by the legal and social restrictions placed on her sex in the eighteenth century, she can only envisage autonomy of any form after death\\".Moore, 149‚Äì50. Themes =Reason, feeling, and imagination= Caspar David Friedrich, Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, (1818), Kunsthalle Hamburg Often categorized as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates her commitment to and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason.Poovey, 83‚Äì84; Myers, 167. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves as a tool for reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason‚Äîthe view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)‚Äîbut also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.Poovey, 85‚Äì86; see also Myers, 180. Wollstonecraft's theories regarding reason, emotion, and the imagination are closely tied together. Some scholars contend that Wollstonecraft uses the imagination to liberate the self, especially the feminine self; it allows her to envision roles for women outside the traditional bounds of eighteenth- century thought and offers her a way to articulate those new ideas.Myers, 180; Poovey, 106 In contrast, others view Wollstonecraft's emphasis on the power of the imagination as detrimental, imprisoning her in an \\"individualized, bourgeois desire\\" which can never truly embrace sociality.Poovey, 106; see also, Kaplan, 239. Favret has argued that Wollstonecraft uses the imagination to reconcile \\"masculine understanding\\" and \\"female sensibility\\". Readers must imaginatively \\"work\\" while reading: their efforts will save them from descending into sentimentality as well as from being lured into commercial speculation. Even more importantly, readers become invested in the story of the narrator. Wollstonecraft's language demands that they participate in the \\"plot\\": > 'they' rescue the writer from the villain; 'they' accompany her on her > flight from sorrow ... With the readers' cooperation, the writer reverses > the standard epistolary plot: here the heroine liberates herself by > rejecting her correspondent and by embracing the 'world' outside of the > domestic circle.Favret, 112. In giving the imagination the power to reshape society (a power suggested through numerous allusions to Shakespeare's The Tempest), Wollstonecraft reveals that she has become a Romantic.Favret, 96; 109; 118. =Individual and society= Throughout Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, Wollstonecraft ponders the relationship between society and the individual. While her earlier works largely focus on society's failings and responsibilities, in this work she turns inward, explicitly arguing for the value of personal experience.Todd, 367. In the advertisement for the work, also published as a preface, she explains her role as the \\"hero\\" of the text: > In writing these desultory letters, I found I could not avoid being > continually the first person ‚Äì 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to > correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; > but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became > stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and > reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just > description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had > produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still > fresh.Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 63. Throughout the book, Wollstonecraft ties her own psychic journey and maturation to the progress of civilizations. Nations, like individuals, she maintains have, as Wollstonecraft scholar Mary Poovey describes it, \\"a collective 'understanding' that evolves organically, 'ripening' gradually to fruition\\".Poovey, 85; see also, Kelly, 187‚Äì88; Myers, 166. However, Wollstonecraft still views civilization's tragedies as worthier of concern than individual or fictional tragedies, suggesting that, for her, sympathy is at the core of social relations:Moskal, 283. > I have then considered myself as a particle broken off from the grand mass > of mankind; ‚Äî I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like > the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still a part of a mighty > whole, from which I could not sever myself‚Äînot, perhaps, for the reflection > has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which > loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or > poisons the current of the heart.Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 69‚Äì70. =Nature= Wollstonecraft dedicates significant portions of Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark to descriptions of nature and her emotional responses to it. One of her most effective tactics is to associate a set of thoughts and feelings with a specific natural formation, such as the waterfall passage quoted above. Nature, Wollstonecraft assumes, is \\"a common reference point\\" between readers and herself, therefore her letters should generate a sense of social sympathy with them.Poovey, 88; Kelly, 189‚Äì90. Many of the letters contain these \\"miniature Romantic excursus\\" which illustrate Wollstonecraft's ideas regarding the connections between nature, God, and the self.Myers, 178; see also Holmes, 26. The natural world becomes \\"the necessary ground of speculation and the crucial field of experience\\".Poovey, 88. =Gender: \\"Hapless woman! what a fate is thine!\\"= Queen Caroline of Denmark by Jens Juel (1770s) All of Wollstonecraft's writings, including the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, address the concerns of women in eighteenth-century society. As in previous works, she discusses concrete issues such as childcare and relationships with servants, but unlike her more polemical books such as Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787) or the Rights of Woman, this text emphasizes her emotional reactions to nature and maternity. Yet she does not depart from her interest in promoting women's education and rights. In Letter 19, the most explicitly feminist letter, Wollstonecraft anticipates readers' criticisms: \\"still harping on the same subject, you will exclaim ‚Äì How can I avoid it, when most of the struggles of an eventful life have been occasioned by the oppressed state of my sex: we reason deeply, when we forcibly feel.\\"Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 171. Wollstonecraft comes to the realization that she has always been forced to experience the world as a woman‚Äîit is the defining feature of her sense of self.Poovey, 89; Jacobus, 74. Throughout Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, Wollstonecraft comments on the precarious position women occupy in society. She defends and sympathizes with Queen Caroline of Denmark, for example, who had been accused of \\"licentiousness\\" for her extra-marital affair during her marriage to the insane Christian VII. (Wollstonecraft herself had had unorthodox love affairs and an illegitimate child.) Wollstonecraft describes this royal, who was also a progressive social reformer, as a woman of courage who tried to revolutionize her country before it was prepared.Jacobus, 75; Todd, 368, Swaab, 25‚Äì26. Such examples fuel Wollstonecraft's increasing despair and melancholy. At one point, she laments the fate of her daughter: > You know that as a female I am particularly attached to her ‚Äì I feel more > than a mother's fondness and anxiety, when I reflect on the dependent and > oppressed state of her sex. I dread lest she should be forced to sacrifice > her heart to her principles, or principles to her heart. With trembling hand > I shall cultivate sensibility, and cherish delicacy of sentiment, lest, > whilst I lend fresh blushes to the rose, I sharpen the thorns that will > wound the breast I would fain guard ‚Äì I dread to unfold her mind, lest it > should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit ‚Äì Hapless woman! > what a fate is thine!Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 97. Wollstonecraft's anger and frustration over the secondary status afforded women compels her to define herself in antithesis to conventional images of femininity. In the first letter she proudly announces \\"at supper my host told me bluntly that I was a woman of observation, for I asked him men's questions\\" (emphasis Wollstonecraft's).Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 68; see also Myers, 174. Wollstonecraft casts the female imagination as the productive counterpoint to destructive masculine commerce, a feat she achieves primarily through her use of the genre of the letter. While the Rights of Woman argued that women should be \\"useful\\" and \\"productive\\", importing the language of the market into the home, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark adopts the values of the domestic space for the larger social and political world.Favret, 120; see also, 96; 127. =Commercialism= Although Wollstonecraft spends much of Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark musing on nature and its connection to the self, a great deal of the text is actually about the debasing effects of commerce on culture. She argues, for example, that the damage done to Hamburg and France by mercenaries and an increasingly commercial culture is far greater than the damage caused by the violence of the French revolution, writing that \\"the sword has been merciful, compared with the depredations made on human life by contractors, and by the swarm of locusts who have battened on the pestilence they spread abroad\\".Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 195; see also Todd, 369; Kelly, 179; 181. Wollstonecraft believed that commerce \\"embruted\\" the mind and fostered a selfish disposition in its practitioners.Jacobus, 67; Poovey, 93; Myers, 177. Commerce should be, she thought, \\"regulated by ideas of justice and fairness and directed toward the ideals of independence and benevolence\\".Jones, 53. Wollstonecraft had become disenchanted with Imlay not only because of his dismissive attitude towards her but also because of his greed. Throughout Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, she attaches criticisms of commerce to the anonymous lover who has betrayed her: > A man ceases to love humanity, and then individuals, as he advances in the > chase after wealth; as one clashes with his interest, the other with his > pleasures: to business, as it is termed, every thing must give way; nay, is > sacrificed; and all the endearing charities of citizen, husband, father, > brother, become empty names.Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 193. Throughout the text, she contrasts the constructive, creative imagination with destructive commerce. By associating commercialism with the anonymous lover in the text, Wollstonecraft was also directly censuring Imlay, who she believed cared more for his business speculations than for her and their child.Favret, 119ff. =Revolution and progress= Wollstonecraft spends several large sections of Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark speculating about the possibilities of social and political revolution and outlining a trajectory for the progress of civilization. In comparing Norway with Britain and France, for example, she argues that the Norwegians are more progressive because they have a free press, embrace religious toleration, distribute their land fairly, and have a politically active populace. However, her description of Norway's \\"golden age\\"Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 66. becomes less rhapsodic after she discovers that the country has no universities or scientists.Taylor, 169‚Äì70. In many ways Norwegian society embodied the British radical ideal of \\"a small-producer society, its wealth sufficiently dispersed to ensure rough equality\\", similar to what Wollstonecraft had outlined in A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790). After careful consideration of how to improve the social and political problems in the places she visited, Wollstonecraft came to the conclusion that social progress must occur at a measured and \\"natural\\" rate. She argues that each country has to find its own way to improve, that democratic revolution cannot be foisted upon a people.Furniss, 79. She believed that the lower classes and the yeomen were the most promising \\"potential source of revolutionary social transformation\\".Kelly, 186; see also 181. Implicit in her assessment, however, was a bourgeois condescension; she viewed the lower classes as a group separate from herself, at one point describing their behavior as \\"picturesque\\".Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 184. Reception and legacy Wollstonecraft was prompted to publish Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark because she was heavily in debt. The successful sales of this, her most popular book in the 1790s, came at an opportune moment.Todd, 367; Furniss, 77; Kaplan, 262; Holmes, 36; Sapiro, 35; Favret, 128. Well-received by reviewers, the work was translated into German, Dutch, Swedish, and Portuguese; published in America; and reissued in a second edition in 1802.Holmes, 36; Todd, 369‚Äì70; Kelly, 194. James Northcote, William Godwin, oil on canvas, 1802, the National Portrait Gallery Amelia Alderson praised the work, separating the philosopher from the woman: \\"As soon as I read your Letters from Norway, the cold awe which the philosopher had excited was lost in the tender sympathy call'd forth by the woman.\\"Qtd. in Poovey, 82; see also Swaab, 27. William Godwin, Wollstonecraft's future husband, wrote in his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman that reading Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark caused him to fall in love with Wollstonecraft: > If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, > this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that > fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time > that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had > tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness > of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded > attachment. Connecting the work to Wollstonecraft's first novel, Mary: A Fiction (1788), he celebrates its sensibility and \\"eroticizes the condition of feminine sorrow\\"; for Godwin, the work was an epistolary romance, not a work of political commentary. After Wollstonecraft's death in 1797, Godwin published her original letters to Imlay (destroying the originals in the process). He deleted all references to contemporary political events and her business negotiations, emphasizing the romantic connection between the two sets of letters. Favret contends that Godwin wanted the public to see Wollstonecraft's affair as a sentimental romance akin to that between Charlotte and Werther in Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther (1774).Jacobus, 65; Todd, 449; Favret, 130‚Äì31. For a woman, a one-year-old child, and a maid to travel to Scandinavia without the protection of a man was unprecedented in the eighteenth century.Moskal, 264‚Äì65. The book resulting from the trip also seemed highly unusual to readers at the time: details of Wollstonecraft's travels to a rarely visited area of the world, what one editor of the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark describes as \\"a boreal wilderness\\", intrigued and even shocked contemporary readers.Holmes, 16‚Äì17. The unorthodox theology of the book also alienated some readers.Poovey, 256, n. 8. The Monthly Magazine and American Review wrote: > [She] discarded all faith in christianity. ... From this period she adored > [God] ... not as one whose interposing power is ever silently at work on the > grand theatre of human affairs, causing eventual good to spring from present > evil, and permitting nothing but for wise and benevolent purposes; but > merely as the first great cause and vital spring of existence. Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark retreated from Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, shocking some conservative readers who were not prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness.Swaab, 21; 27. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented her work as a failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform.Holmes, 42 Swaab, 27. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.Favret, 128. After the publication of Godwin's Memoirs, which revealed and endorsed Wollstonecraft's love affairs and illegitimate child, her works were scorned by the majority of the public. Nevertheless, \\"the book was to arouse a passion for travel among cultivated people in Europe\\". Intrepid nineteenth-century British female travel writers such as Isabella Bird and Mary Kingsley still read it and were inspired by Wollstonecraft's pioneering efforts.Holmes, 41. Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was republished at the end of the nineteenth century and Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of Treasure Island, took a copy on his trip to Samoa in 1890.Nystr√∂m 8; Holmes, 36. Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was a powerful influence on Wollstonecraft's daughter, Mary Shelley. In 1817, Shelley would publish History of a Six Weeks' Tour, a narrative of her travels through Europe and to Lake Geneva which was modeled after her mother's work.Bennett, 26‚Äì27. =Romanticism= Draft of \\"Kubla Khan\\" (1797; 1816) The Romantic poets were more profoundly affected by Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark than anyone, except perhaps Godwin. The poet Robert Southey, for example, wrote to his publisher: \\"Have you met with Mary Wollstonecraft's [travel book]? She has made me in love with a cold climate, and frost and snow, with a northern moonlight.\\"Qtd. in Holmes, 17. The book's combination of progressive social views with the advocacy of individual subjective experience influenced writers such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.Holmes, 41; Sapiro, 35. Wollstonecraft's \\"incarnational theory of the creative imagination\\" paved the way for Wordsworth's thorough treatment of the imagination and its relation to the self in Book V of The Prelude (1805; 1850).Swaab, 20; Poovey, 89. Her book also had a significant influence on Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1797‚Äì99) and Percy Shelley's Alastor (1815); their depictions of \\"quest[s] for a settled home\\" strongly resemble Wollstonecraft's.Swaab, 24. The most striking homage to Wollstonecraft's work, however, is in Coleridge's famous poem \\"Kubla Khan\\" (1797; 1816).Holmes, 39; Moore, 146. Not only does much of his style descend from the book, but at one point he alludes to Wollstonecraft as he is describing a cold wasteland: See also * Timeline of Mary Wollstonecraft Notes Modern editions * Wollstonecraft, Mary.

Mostly, RBS refers to bacterial sequences, although internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) have been described in mRNAs of eukaryotic cells or viruses that infect eukaryotes. Ribosome recruitment in eukaryotes is generally mediated by the 5' cap present on eukaryotic mRNAs.  Prokaryotes  The RBS in prokaryotes is a region upstream of the start codon. This region of the mRNA has the consensus 5'-AGGAGG-3', also called the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. The complementary sequence (CCUCCU), called the anti-Shine- Dalgarno (ASD) is contained in the 3‚Äô end of the 16S region of the smaller (30S) ribosomal subunit. Upon encountering the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the ASD of the ribosome base pairs with it, after which translation is initiated. Variations of the 5'-AGGAGG-3' sequence have been found in Archaea as highly conserved 5‚Ä≤-GGTG-3‚Ä≤ regions, 5 basepairs upstream of the start site. Additionally, some bacterial initiation regions, such as rpsA in E.coli completely lack identifiable SD sequences. = Effect on translation initiation rate = Prokaryotic ribosomes begin translation of the mRNA transcript while DNA is still being transcribed. Thus translation and transcription are parallel processes. Bacterial mRNA are usually polycistronic and contain multiple ribosome binding sites. Translation initiation is the most highly regulated step of protein synthesis in prokaryotes. The rate of translation depends on two factors: * the rate at which a ribosome is recruited to the RBS * the rate at which a recruited ribosome is able to initiate translation (i.e. the translation initiation efficiency) The RBS sequence affects both of these factors.  Factors affecting rate of ribosome recruitment  The ribosomal protein S1 binds to adenine sequences upstream of the RBS. Increasing the concentration of adenine upstream of the RBS will increase the rate of ribosome recruitment.  Factors affecting the efficiency of translation initiation  The level of complementarity of the mRNA SD sequence to the ribosomal ASD greatly affects the efficiency of translation initiation. Richer complementarity results in higher initiation efficiency. It is worth noting that this only holds up to a certain point - having too rich of a complementarity is known to paradoxically decrease the rate of translation as the ribosome then happens to be bound too tightly to proceed downstream. The optimal distance between the RBS and the start codon is variable - it depends on the portion of the SD sequence encoded in the actual RBS and its distance to the start site of a consensus SD sequence. Optimal spacing increases the rate of translation initiation once a ribosome has been bound. The composition of nucleotides in the spacer region itself was also found to affect the rate of translation initiation in one study. = Heat shock proteins = Secondary structures formed by the RBS can affect the translational efficiency of mRNA, generally inhibiting translation. These secondary structures are formed by H-bonding of the mRNA base pairs and are sensitive to temperature. At a higher-than-usual temperature (~42 ¬∞C), the RBS secondary structure of heat shock proteins becomes undone thus allowing ribosomes to bind and initiate translation. This mechanism allows a cell to quickly respond to an increase in temperature.  Eukaryotes  = 5' cap = Ribosome recruitment in eukaryotes happens when eukaryote initiation factors elF4F and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) recognize the 5' capped mRNA and recruit the 43S ribosome complex at that location. Translation initiation happens following recruitment of the ribosome, at the start codon (underlined) found within the Kozak consensus sequence ACC _AUG_ G. Since the Kozak sequence itself is not involved in the recruitment of the ribosome, it is not considered a ribosome binding site. = Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) = Eukaryotic ribosomes are known to bind to transcripts in a mechanism unlike the one involving the 5' cap, at a sequence called the internal ribosome entry site. This process is not dependent on the full set of translation initiation factors (although this depends on the specific IRES) and is commonly found in the translation of viral mRNA.  Gene annotation  The identification of RBSs is used to determine the site of translation initiation in an unannotated sequence. This is referred to as N-terminal prediction. This is especially useful when multiple start codons are situated around the potential start site of the protein coding sequence. Identification of RBSs is particularly difficult, because they tend to be highly degenerated. One approach to identifying RBS in E.coli is using neural networks. Another approach is using the Gibbs sampling method.  History  The Shine-Dalgarno sequence, of the prokaryotic RBS, was discovered by John Shine and Lynne Dalgarno in 1975. The Kozak consensus sequence was first identified by Marilyn Kozak in 1984 while she was in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh.

The short was released on June 30, 1962, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.  Plot  The Road Runner (Disappearialis Quickius) zooms to the end of a cliff and watches as Wile E. Coyote (Overconfidentii Vulgaris) takes steps back on a different cliff, attempting to jump to the other side, and the end falls off when he steps on it, and the title appears. While falling, the rock turns upside down and Wile E. struggles to get on the new top side. He thinks that he made it to the top and starts panting, but then realizes he is actually upside down again. He gets the pointy end stuck between two cliff ends. He then goes on the left end, but that end falls off and hits the ground, and a small accordion-squished Wile E. walks away with the coney cliff end on him. Later, Wile E., who is back to normal, then again chases the Road Runner. When the Road Runner stops at the top of a natural arch and gets Wile E. to stop as well, the bird points at the ground. Wile E.'s nose then points to the ground, before he falls to the ground once more. The Road Runner zips off and Wile E. tries to deduce how did the bird managed to defy gravity, but finally admits he is clueless. 1\\\\. Wile E. then sets up a bear trap in the middle of the road, struggling in the process. Once the trap is set, he placed a bowl of ACME Bird Seed on the trap's base and hides behind a rock. The Road Runner sees the bird seed, eats it and zooms off, but the trap does not go off. Confused, the Coyote approaches the trap with an oilcan, applies a tiny drop of oil to the base (while standing inside the trap), and then it finally closes‚Äîon him. The zigzag-shaped Coyote walks off with a deadpan \\"Ouch\\". 2\\\\. An attempt to chase the Road Runner with a jet mobile ends up with the motor's fire burning the support beam, causing the entire apparatus to collapse. 3\\\\. Wile E. uses an ACME Instant Icicle Maker. \\"Freeze Your Friend-Loads of Laughs\\". After experimenting on a cactus, he tries to freeze the Road Runner. As soon as he hears the \\"Beep-Beep\\", he jumps out on the road to see the approaching bird, but the machine then activates, freezing the Coyote instead. Wile E. tries to thaw himself out with a magnifying glass, but only ends up melting himself into a puddle along with the ice as well. 4\\\\. Finally, the Coyote paints iron glue on an ACME Boomerang, but when he prepares to launch the boomerang, the glue droops down onto his hand, sticking the Coyote onto the boomerang and carrying him with it as he throws it. While still in the air, Wile E. attempts to free himself from the sticky boomerang, but only ends up getting both his hands stuck on his head. He crashes rear first on the ground, then walks away with the boomerang stuck on his back legs. An iris out shaped like a boomerang appears, then stops to show the words The End. The title is a pun on the motion picture title \\"Room at the Top\\".

It is designed to be paired with a second support chip known as a northbridge. As with any other southbridge, the ICH is used to connect and control peripheral devices. As CPU speeds increased data transmission between the CPU and support chipset, the support chipset eventually emerged as a bottleneck between the processor and the motherboard. Accordingly, starting with the Intel 5 Series, a new architecture was used that incorporated some functions of the traditional north and south bridge chips onto the CPU itself, with the remaining functions being consolidated into a single Platform Controller Hub (PCH). This replaces the traditional two chip setup.  ICH  ICH - 82801AA The first version of the ICH was released in June 1999 along with the Intel 810 northbridge. While its predecessor, the PIIX, was connected to the northbridge through an internal PCI bus with a bandwidth of 133 MB/s, the ICH used a proprietary interface (called by Intel Hub Interface) that linked it to the northbridge through an 8-bit wide, 266 MB/s bus. The Hub Interface was a point-to-point connection between different components on the motherboard. Another design decision was to substitute the rigid North-South axis on the motherboard with a star structure. Note that, along with the ICH, Intel evolved other uses of the \\"Hub\\" terminology. Thus, the northbridge became the Memory Controller Hub (MCH) or if it had integrated graphics (e.g., Intel 810), the Graphics and Memory Controller Hub (GMCH). Other ICH features include: * PCI Rev 2.2 compliant with support for 33 MHz PCI operations. * Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) Support * Integrated IDE controller for Ultra ATA support * Integrated I/O APIC supporting 24 interrupt sources * System Management Bus (SMBus) with support for I¬≤C devices * AC'97 2.1 Compliant Link * Low Pin Count (LPC) interface The ICH came in two flavors: *82801AA (ICH) - Ultra ATA/66 support, 6 PCI slots, Alert on LAN support *82801AB (ICH0) - Ultra ATA/33 support, 4 PCI slots, no Alert on LAN  ICH2  ICH2 In early 2000 Intel had suffered a significant setback with the i820 northbridge. Customers were not willing to pay the high prices for RDRAM and either bought i810 or i440BX motherboards or changed to the competition. The hastily developed 82815 northbridge, which supported PC-133 SDRAM, became Intel's method to recover in the middle range segment. The ICH1 or the new ICH2 (360 pins) could be placed to the side of the 82815. An ICH2 could also be used with Intel's 82850 chipset, which, like the 82820 before it, required the use of RDRAM and supported the Pentium 4 CPU. For the first time a Fast Ethernet chip (82559) was integrated into the southbridge, depending upon an external PHY chip. The PATA interface was accelerated to ATA/100 and the number of USB connections was doubled to four. The integrated AC'97 sound controller gained support for up to six channel sound. There was also a mobile variant called the ICH2-M. The following variants existed: *82801BA (ICH2) *82801BAM (ICH2-M) Mobile  ICH3  ICH3-M In 2001, Intel delivered ICH3, which was available in two versions: the server version, ICH3-S, running with the E7501 Northbridge, and the mobile version, ICH3-M, which worked with the i830 and i845 northbridges. There is no version for desktop motherboards. In comparison with the ICH2, the changes were limited: \\"Native Mode\\" support in the PATA Controller; up to six USB-1.1 devices; SMBus 2.0; and the newest SpeedStep version, which allowed power-saving devices to be switched off during operation. The chip had 421 pins. This has the following variants: *82801CA (ICH3-S) Server *82801CAM (ICH3-M) Mobile  ICH4  ICH4 The ICH4 was Intel's southbridge for the year 2002. The most important innovation was the support of USB 2.0 on all six ports. Sound support was improved and corresponded the newest AC'97 specification, version 2.3. Like the preceding generation, the ICH4 had 421 pins. This has the following variants: *82801DB (ICH4) Base *82801DBM (ICH4-M) Base Mobile  ICH5  ICH5 In 2003, and in conjunction with the i865 and i875 northbridges, the ICH5 was created. A SATA host controller was integrated. The ICH5R variant additionally supported RAID 0 on SATA ports. Eight USB-2.0 ports were available. The chip had full support for ACPI 2.0. It had 460 pins. Since 1999 the 266 MB/s hub interface was assumed to be a bottleneck. In the new chip generation, Intel therefore offered an optional port for a Gigabit Ethernet Controller directly attached to the MCH. The goal of this CSA technology was to reduce the latencies for Gigabit LAN by direct memory access and to free up bandwidth on the Hub interface between ICH and MCH for non removable disk and PCI data traffic. Since mid-2004, the large motherboard manufacturers noticed an increased complaint ratio with motherboards equipped with ICH5. A cause was the insufficient ESD tolerance of certain ICH5 steppings. In particular, when connecting USB devices via front panels, the chips died by discharges of static electricity. Intel reacted to the problem by shipping ICH5 with increased ESD tolerance. Effective ESD preventive measures on USB ports are difficult and costly, since they can impair the quality of the USB-2.0 high-speed signals. Many motherboard manufacturers had omitted the necessary high-quality safety devices for front panel connectors for cost reasons. This has the following variants: *82801E (C-ICH) Communications *82801EB (ICH5) Base *82801ER (ICH5R) RAID *82801EBM (ICH5-M) Base Mobile *6300ESB (ESB) Enterprise Southbridge  ICH6  ICH6M ICH6 was Intel's first PCI Express southbridge. It made four PCI Express √ó1 ports available. Faster √ó16-Ports were accommodated in the MCH. The bottleneck Hub interface was replaced by a new Direct Media Interface (in reality a PCI Express √ó4 link) with 1 GB/s of bandwidth per direction. Support for Intel High Definition Audio was included. In addition, AC'97 and the classical PCI 2.3 were still supported. Two additional SATA ports were added, and one PATA channel was removed. The ICH6R variant supported RAID modes 0, 1, 0+1 and the Intel specific \\"Matrix RAID\\". ICH6R and ICH6-M implemented AHCI SATA controllers for the first time. The chips had 652 pins. Originally Intel had planned to bring two further variants under the names ICH6W and ICH6RW to the market, which should contain a software Access Point for a Wireless LAN. These chips are published. This has the following variants: *82801FB (ICH6) Base *82801FR (ICH6R) RAID *82801FBM (ICH6M) Base Mobile *6311ESB (ESB2) Enterprise Southbridge *6321ESB (ESB2) Enterprise Southbridge with integrated LAN for embedded  ICH7  NH82801GB - ICH7 Base The ICH7 started to ship in mid-2005 together with Intel's new high-end MCH, the i955X. Two additional PCI express √ó1-Ports, a SATA 2.0 Controller for up to 300 MB/s data transmission rate (the mobile version has this capability disabled), as well as support for Intel's \\"Active Management Technology\\" were added. Only the ICH7DH, ICH7R, ICH7-M, ICH7-M DH chip have AHCI support. The ICH7 (Base) and ICH7-U (Ultra-mobile) chip do not support AHCI. The ICH7R additionally supports RAID 5. This has the following variants: *82801GB (ICH7) Base *82801GR (ICH7R) RAID *82801GDH (ICH7DH) Digital Home *82801GBM (ICH7M) Mobile *82801GHM (ICH7M DH) Mobile Digital Home *PC82801GU (ICH7-U) Ultra-mobile  ICH8  82801HBM ICH8 is offered in several different versions and is the complement to the 965 class MCH chips. The non-mobile ICH8 does not have a traditional PATA interface, and just one AC'97. In practice, most baseboard manufacturers still offered PATA appropriate connection types using additional chips from manufacturers such as JMicron or Marvell. The ICH8 was the first ICH model to control eSATA and Gigabit Ethernet, which were previously accommodated in the MCH. The base version only includes four SATA 2.0 ports. The ICH8R (RAID) and above chips support six SATA devices. Additionally the ICH8DH (Digital Home) has Quick Resume and can be used together with the P965 and/or G965 in Intel Viiv- certified systems. The counterpart to the ICH8DO (Digital Office) is the Q965 MCH, which together provide Intel vPro compatibility. This has the following variants: *82801HB (ICH8) Base *82801HR (ICH8R) RAID *82801HH (ICH8DH) Digital Home *82801HO (ICH8DO) Digital Office *82801HM (ICH8M) Mobile *82801HBM (ICH8BM) Base Mobile *82801HEM (ICH8EM) Enhanced Mobile  ICH9  82801IBM The ICH9 came out in May 2007 in the P35 (Bearlake) chipset. It removes all PATA support. In practice, many motherboard manufacturers continue providing PATA support using third-party chips. Officially only the ICH9R, ICH9DH, ICH9DO chip have AHCI support. This part has the following variants: *82801IB (ICH9) Base officially has neither AHCI or RAID support, but with a simple BIOS mod can add support for AHCI. *82801IR (ICH9R) RAID with AHCI and RAID Support *82801IH (ICH9DH) Digital Home with AHCI and no RAID Support *82801IO (ICH9DO) Digital Office with AHCI and RAID Support *82801IBM (ICH9M) Base Mobile *82801IEM (ICH9EM) Enhanced Mobile *82801IUX (ICH9M-SFF) Ultra Mobile  ICH10  Intel launched the ICH10 southbridge in June 2008 with the P45 (Eaglelake) chipset. ICH10 implements the 1GB/s bidirectional DMI interface to the \\"northbridge\\" device. It supports various interfaces to \\"low-speed\\" peripherals, and it supports a suite of housekeeping functions. ICH10 also offers reduced load on CPU and decreased power consumption. ICH10 does not offer direct PATA or LPT support. Notably there is support of 'hot-swap' functionality. The RAID variant also supports a new technology called ‚ÄúTurbo Memory‚Äù. This allows the use of flash memory on a motherboard for fast caching. Peripheral support includes: *Six PCIe version 1.1 ports, which can be configured as either 4 √ó1 or 1 √ó4. *PCI bus *Six SATA 3 Gbit/s ports in either legacy IDE or AHCI mode. Can support external eSATA *Intel High Definition Audio *Integrated gigabit LAN. *Two EHCI host controllers (which support up to twelve USB 2.0 connections) with companion UHCI controllers to handle low-speed and full-speed USB devices This part has the following variants: *82801JB (ICH10) Base *82801JR (ICH10R) RAID *82801JH (ICH10D) Digital Home *82801JO (ICH10DO) Digital Office  PCH architecture  As CPU speeds increased, a bottleneck eventually emerged between the processor and the motherboard, due to limitations caused by data transmission between the CPU and southbridge. Accordingly, starting with the Intel 5 Series, a new architecture was used where some functions of the north and south bridge chips were moved to the CPU, and others were consolidated into a Platform Controller Hub (PCH). * Some northbridge functions, including the memory controller and Graphics (PCI-e) lanes, were integrated into the CPU, while the PCH took over the remaining functions in addition to the traditional roles of the southbridge. The northbridge was therefore eliminated. * Other northbridge functions and all southbridge functions were migrated to a new Platform Controller Hub. These included clocking (the system clock), Flexible Display Interface (FDI) and Direct Media Interface (DMI). The FDI is only used when the chipset requires supporting a processor with integrated graphics.

According to Freedom House the human rights situation significantly improved in the aftermath of the Euromaidan revolution in 2014. The country received better ratings for political pluralism, parliamentary elections, and government transparency. As of 2015 the country is labelled \\"Partly Free\\". According to the OSCE, as of 2015 the elections in Ukraine generally respect democratic process, but additional efforts needed to enhance public confidence. According to the last report by Human Rights Watch organization both sides are violating laws of war during ongoing War in Donbass, the government imposed excessive restrictions on freedom of media and the sexual diversity is not fully respected. On 21 May 2015 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has passed a resolution declaring the suspension of conventions for Human Rights in the eastern Donbass region. International and European human rights treaties = Ukraine is a party of the following international treaties = *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) *(First) Optional Protocol to the ICCPR *International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights *Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) *Optional Protocol to CEDAW *Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) *Optional Protocol to the CRC on the involvement of children in armed conflict *International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination *Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment *Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture *Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) *Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (1967) Ukraine signed but not yet ratified *Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court = Ukraine is a party of the following European treaties = *European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) (1950) *Protocol No. 6 to the ECHR concerning the abolition of the death penalty in times of peace (1983) *Protocol No. 12 to the ECHR concerning the general prohibition of discrimination (2000) *Protocol No. 13 to the ECHR concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances (2002) *Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities Situation Meeting in Kharkiv during the 2004 Orange Revolution =Overview= Ukraine had been labeled as \\"free\\" by organizations such as Freedom House in 2009. In their report they stated: \\"Ukraine has one of the most vibrant civil societies in the region. Citizens are increasingly taking issues into their own hands, protesting against unwanted construction, and exposing corruption. There were no limits seen on NGO activities. Trade unions function, but strikes and worker protests were infrequently observed, even though dissatisfaction with the state of economic affairs was pervasive in the fall of 2008. Factory owners were seen as still able to pressure their workers to vote according to the owners‚Äô preferences.\\" On 20 October 2009 experts from the Council of Europe stated \\"in the last five years the experts from the Council of Europe who monitor Ukraine have expressed practically no concerns regarding the important [process of the] formation of a civil society in Ukraine. Ukraine is one of the democratic states in Europe that is securing human rights as a national policy, as well as securing the rights of national minorities.\\" According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), \\"while civil society institutions operate mostly without government interference, police abuse and violations of the rights of vulnerable groups ‚Ä¶ continue to mar Ukraine's human rights record.\\" After the early 2010 election of President Viktor Yanukovych international organizations start to voice their concern. According to Freedom House, \\"Ukraine under President Yanukovych has become less democratic and, if current trends are left unchecked, may head down a path toward autocracy and kleptocracy.\\" Among the recent negative developments, they mentioned \\"a more restrictive environment for the media, selective prosecution of opposition figures, worrisome intrusiveness by the Security Service of Ukraine, widely criticized local elections in October 2010 ‚Ä¶ and erosion of basic freedoms of assembly and speech.\\" This led Freedom House to downgrade Ukraine from \\"Free\\" to \\"Partly Free\\" in Freedom in the World 2011. Also in 2011 Amnesty International spoke of \\"an increase in the number of allegations of torture and ill treatment in police custody, restrictions on the freedom of speech and assembly, as well as mass manifestations of xenophobia\\". In Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index 2010 Ukraine had fallen from 89th place to 131. Neighboring Russia's press freedom was ranked at position 140. The International Federation for Human Rights called Ukraine \\"one of the countries seeing the most serious violations against human rights activists\\" in December 2011. As of 17 January 2013 Ukraine lost all of its 211 cases at the European Court of Human Rights. =The right to fair trial= Amendments to the constitution, which came into force, were detrimental for fair trial in that they re-introduced the so-called general supervision by the prosecutor's office. Other serious problems included lengthy periods for review of cases because the courts were overloaded; infringement of equality of arms; non- observance of the presumption of innocence; the failure to execute court rulings; and high level of corruption in courts. Independent lawyers and human rights activists have complained Ukrainian judges regularly come under pressure to hand down a certain verdict. According to Freedom House the judiciary has become more efficient and less corrupt since the Orange Revolution. Recent (since 2010) trails of high-profile political figures Yulia Tymoshenko, Yuriy Lutsenko, Igor Didenko, Anatoliy Makarenko and Valeriy Ivaschenko have been described by the European Commission, the United States and other international organizations as \\"unfair, untransparent and not independent\\" and \\"selective prosecution of political opponents\\". President Viktor Yanukovych stated late February 2012 these trails \\"didn't meet European standards and principles\\". =Media freedom and freedom of information= In 2007, in Ukraine's provinces numerous, anonymous attacks and threats persisted against journalists, who investigated or exposed corruption or other government misdeeds.Media crackdown under way?, Kyiv Post (22 April 2010) The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists concluded in 2007 that these attacks, and police reluctance in some cases to pursue the perpetrators, were \\"helping to foster an atmosphere of impunity against independent journalists.\\" Ukraine's ranking in Reporters Without Borders's Press Freedom Index has in the latest years been around the 90th spot (89 in 2009, 87 in 2008), while it occupied the 112th spot in 2002 and even the 132nd spot in 2004. Since Viktor Yanukovych was elected President of Ukraine in February 2010 Ukrainian journalists and international journalistic watchdogs have complained about a deterioration of press freedom in Ukraine. Yanukovych responded (in May 2010) that he \\"deeply values press freedom\\" and that \\"free, independent media that must ensure society's unimpeded access to information\\". Anonymous journalists stated early May 2010 that they were voluntarily tailoring their coverage so as not to offend the Yanukovych administration and the Azarov Government.Journalists, in defensive crouch, swing news coverage to Yanukovych's favor, Kyiv Post (6 May 2009) The Azarov Government denies censoring the media,Semynozhenko: No examples of censorship on Ukrainian TV channels, Kyiv Post (13 May 2009) so did the Presidential AdministrationOpposition benefiting from topic of censorship at mass media, says Hanna Herman, Kyiv Post (13 May 2009) and President Yanukovych himself. –Ø–Ω—É–∫–æ–≤–∏—á: –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∞, —è–∫—â–æ –Ñ–≤—Ä–æ–ø–∞ –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∞, BBC Ukrainian (10 May 2010)Special committee calls to check reports of pressure on journalists, Kyiv Post (13 May 2009) The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has resulted in a major threat to press freedom in recent months. A May 2014 report from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) stated that there were approximately 300 instances of violent attacks on the media in Ukraine since November 2013. A crackdown on what authorities describe as \\"pro- separatist\\" points of view has triggered dismay among Western human rights monitors. For example, the 11 September 2014 shutdown of newspaper by the Ukrainian Security Service for \\"violating Ukraine's territorial integrity\\" brought swift condemnation from the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Ukraine has also shut down several television stations operated by Russia on the grounds that they purvey propaganda. In February 2017 the Ukrainian government banned the commercial importation of books from Russia, which had accounted for up to 60% of all titles sold. = Freedom of expression and conscience = FEMEN is a feminist protest group founded in Ukraine in 2008 The organization became internationally known for organizing topless protests against sex tourism, religious institutions, sexism and homophobia Amnesty International has appealed for the release of Ukrainian journalist Ruslan Kotsababy and declared him a prisoner of conscience. =Torture and conditions in detention= Reports of torture and ill-treatment by police persisted during 2007 year, as did unduly long periods of pretrial custody. Of major concern were the inhumane conditions in detention with overcrowded cells, appalling sanitary conditions and the lack of appropriate medical care. During the year numerous group suicide attempts took place in some penal colonies. New evidence of torture was published since May 2016. According to Ivan ≈†imonoviƒá, UN assistant secretary-general for human rights, as published by The Times, both Ukrainian authorities and the authorities of separatist Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics allow torture and run secret jails, and \\"disregard for human rights\\" had become entrenched and systemic. The New York Times reports that, after an exchange of prisoners, some detainees have left Ukrainian jails with visible injuries. On 25 May 2016, the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT) suspended its visit to Ukraine after the government had denied it access to places in several parts of the country where it suspects these secret jails were located. =Human rights abuses and the HIV/AIDS epidemic= The Ukrainian government has taken a number of positive steps to fight HIV/AIDS, chiefly in the area of legislative and policy reform. But these important commitments are being undermined in the criminal justice and health systems by widespread human rights abuses against drug users, sex workers, and people living with HIV/AIDS. =Migrants and refugees= The Ukrainian asylum system barely functions due to a highly decentralized structure spanning several government agencies and departments. The process of creating a single migration system has been slow; political interference in the system is common and abuses of migrants and asylum seekers' rights continue. = Human trafficking = There has been a growing awareness of human trafficking as a human rights issue in Europe. The end of communism has contributed to an increase in human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution. In 2013 Ukraine was a country of origin and country of transit for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation and forced labor. Charcoal production and pornography have been listed in the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor under the country of Ukraine in December 2014. The Government of Ukraine has shown some commitment to combat trafficking, but has been criticized for not fully complying with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, and for inadequate trafficking prevention efforts. = Violence against women = Violence against women is an entrenched social problem in Ukrainian culture engendered by traditional male and female stereotypes. It was not recognized during Soviet era, but in recent decades the issue became an important topic of discussion in Ukrainian society and among academic scholars. According to the estimation of OSCE the violence towards women is widespread in Ukraine and it is associated with three times more deaths than the ongoing armed conflict in the eastern provinces of the country.The OSCE draws attention to violence against women in Ukraine (7 March 2018) = Linguistic rights = In 2017 a new law on education has been adopted by Ukrainian government to reform the education system. The language provisions of the law made it highly controversial both locally and in neighboring states, as it envisages that all secondary education will be taught in Ukrainian. According to the law an instruction in minority languages at kindergarten and primary school level remains unaffected, but at the secondary level national minority languages are now being reduced to special lessons. The approval of the legislation provoked a harsh reaction in Hungary, Romania, Russia, Poland, Bulgaria and some other countries. For example, Romanian parliament approved declaration criticizing the law and warned that Ukraine cannot go far toward EU integration without a respect to the linguistic rights of national minorities.Ukraine‚Äôs Poorly Timed Education Law Ukrainian authorities have submitted the law for review by the Venice Commission, a body which rules on rights and democracy disputes in Europe. In an opinion adopted formally the commission said that \\"the strong domestic and international criticism drawn especially by the provisions reducing the scope of education in minority languages seems justified\\".Criticism of Ukraine's language law justified: rights body War in Donbass During the ongoing warfare in Donbass, Ukraine has lost control over the territories of Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic and therefore suspended its human right obligations there. On 21 May 2015 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has passed a resolution declaring that it has withdrawn from some of the obligations stipulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(articles 2, 9, 12, 14, 17), the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms(articles 5, 6, 8, 13) and European Social Charter(articles 1 p. 2, 4 p. 2-3, 8 p. 1, 14 p. 1, 15,16,17 p. 1a p. 1c, 23,30, 31 p. 1-2) at the Donbass region until \\"Russia cease its aggression in eastern Ukraine\\".

This means that it can determine nanoparticle size distributions, resolve the size and shape of (monodisperse) macromolecules, determine pore sizes, characteristic distances of partially ordered materials, and much more. This is achieved by analyzing the elastic scattering behaviour of X-rays when travelling through the material, recording their scattering at small angles (typically 0.1 ‚Äì 10¬∞, hence the \\"Small-angle\\" in its name). It belongs to the family of small-angle scattering (SAS) techniques along with small-angle neutron scattering, and is typically done using hard X-rays with a wavelength of 0.07 ‚Äì 0.2 nm.. Depending on the angular range in which a clear scattering signal can be recorded, SAXS is capable of delivering structural information of dimensions between 1 and 100 nm, and of repeat distances in partially ordered systems of up to 150 nm. USAXS (ultra-small angle X-ray scattering) can resolve even larger dimensions, as the smaller the recorded angle, the larger the object dimensions that are probed. SAXS and USAXS belong to a family of X-ray scattering techniques that are used in the characterization of materials. In the case of biological macromolecules such as proteins, the advantage of SAXS over crystallography is that a crystalline sample is not needed. Furthermore, the properties of SAXS allow investigation of conformational diversity in these molecules. Burger, Virginia M., Daniel J. Arenas, and Collin M. Stultz. \\"A structure-free method for quantifying conformational flexibility in proteins.\\" Scientific reports 6 (2016): 29040. DOI: 10.1038/srep29040 (2016). http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/108809 Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods encounter problems with macromolecules of higher molecular mass (> 30‚Äì40 kDa). However, owing to the random orientation of dissolved or partially ordered molecules, the spatial averaging leads to a loss of information in SAXS compared to crystallography. Applications SAXS is used for the determination of the microscale or nanoscale structure of particle systems in terms of such parameters as averaged particle sizes, shapes, distribution, and surface-to-volume ratio. The materials can be solid or liquid and they can contain solid, liquid or gaseous domains (so-called particles) of the same or another material in any combination. Not only particles, but also the structure of ordered systems like lamellae, and fractal-like materials can be studied. The method is accurate, non-destructive and usually requires only a minimum of sample preparation. Applications are very broad and include colloids of all types, metals, cement, oil, polymers, plastics, proteins, foods and pharmaceuticals and can be found in research as well as in quality control. The X-ray source can be a laboratory source or synchrotron light which provides a higher X-ray flux. SAXS instruments In a SAXS instrument, a monochromatic beam of X-rays is brought to a sample from which some of the X-rays scatter, while most simply go through the sample without interacting with it. The scattered X-rays form a scattering pattern which is then detected at a detector which is typically a 2-dimensional flat X-ray detector situated behind the sample perpendicular to the direction of the primary beam that initially hit the sample. The scattering pattern contains the information on the structure of the sample. The major problem that must be overcome in SAXS instrumentation is the separation of the weak scattered intensity from the strong main beam. The smaller the desired angle, the more difficult this becomes. The problem is comparable to one encountered when trying to observe a weakly radiant object close to the sun, like the sun's corona. Only if the moon blocks out the main light source does the corona become visible. Likewise, in SAXS the non-scattered beam that merely travels through the sample must be blocked, without blocking the closely adjacent scattered radiation. Most available X-ray sources produce divergent beams and this compounds the problem. In principle the problem could be overcome by focusing the beam, but this is not easy when dealing with X-rays and was previously not done except on synchrotrons where large bent mirrors can be used. This is why most laboratory small angle devices rely on collimation instead. Laboratory SAXS instruments can be divided into two main groups: point-collimation and line-collimation instruments: =Point-collimation instruments= Point- collimation instruments have pinholes that shape the X-ray beam to a small circular or elliptical spot that illuminates the sample. Thus the scattering is centro-symmetrically distributed around the primary X-ray beam and the scattering pattern in the detection plane consists of circles around the primary beam. Owing to the small illuminated sample volume and the wastefulness of the collimation process‚Äîonly those photons are allowed to pass that happen to fly in the right direction‚Äîthe scattered intensity is small and therefore the measurement time is in the order of hours or days in case of very weak scatterers. If focusing optics like bent mirrors or bent monochromator crystals or collimating and monochromating optics like multilayers are used, measurement time can be greatly reduced. Point- collimation allows the orientation of non-isotropic systems (fibres, sheared liquids) to be determined. =Line-collimation instruments= Line-collimation instruments restrict the beam only in one dimension (rather than two as for point collimation) so that the beam cross-section is a long but narrow line. The illuminated sample volume is much larger compared to point-collimation and the scattered intensity at the same flux density is proportionally larger. Thus measuring times with line-collimation SAXS instruments are much shorter compared to point-collimation and are in the range of minutes. A disadvantage is that the recorded pattern is essentially an integrated superposition (a self-convolution) of many adjacent pinhole patterns. The resulting smearing can be easily removed using model-free algorithms or deconvolution methods based on Fourier transformation, but only if the system is isotropic. Line collimation is of great benefit for any isotropic nanostructured materials, e.g. proteins, surfactants, particle dispersion and emulsions.

The film stars Sam Rockwell and Anjelica Huston. Production took place in New Jersey in 2007. It premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and was purchased by Fox Searchlight Pictures for distribution. The film was released on September 26, 2008 and the DVD was released on February 17, 2009. This film should not be confused with the arthouse movie of the same title made in 2020 by Epoch, directed by Gregory Hatanaka, starring Shane Ryan, Scott Butler, Sarah Brine and Lisa London. which is about auto-erotic asphyxiation. Choke (2008) is based on the 2001 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. It tells the story of a man who works in a colonial theme park, attends sexual addiction recovery meetings, and intentionally chokes on food in upscale restaurants so his \\"rescuers\\" would give him money out of sympathy and thus cover his mother's Alzheimer's disease hospital bills. Plot Victor Mancini is a sex addict who works as a reenactor of life in Colonial America. He works with his best friend, Denny, who is also a reformed sex addict. To support his hospitalized mother, Ida, Victor cons others by intentionally choking at restaurants to get money from his rescuers. When he visits his mother one day, he meets Dr Paige Marshall, who takes care of her. She tells Victor that his mother's condition is worsening and that they could try an experimental stem cell technique that would require harvesting cells from the umbilical cord of a newborn baby with Victor's genes. She convinces Victor to have sex with her so she can have his child and save his mother. Victor never knew his father and is anxious to obtain the information from his mother, but she never recognizes him when he visits. He asks Denny to pose as him and ask her questions. Denny agrees and reveals that Victor's mother kept a diary. Victor finds it, but it is in Italian. Paige tells Victor she can read Italian and agrees to translate the diary. Victor and Paige try several times to have sex, but Victor cannot maintain an erection. After discussing it with Denny, Victor realizes he loves Paige. She then reveals to him that his mother may have fled Italy because she stole Jesus' foreskin, and used its cells to conceive Victor, making him the Second Coming. He is reluctant to believe but, in the end, accepts Paige's assertion. However, his mother finally recognizes him and tells him that she stole him as a baby and she has no idea who his birth parents are. As she tells him this, he feeds her chocolate pudding and accidentally chokes her to death. While Paige tries to resuscitate Victor's mother, a hidden band around her wrist falls into Victor's view, revealing that she is a patient in the hospital‚Äînot a doctor. Paige then reveals that she was admitted to the hospital years ago, in a catatonic state, and fell in love with Victor through the stories his mother told her about him. As she was a former medical student, the nurses allowed her to wear a white coat, as it calmed her down. Paige, a voluntary patient, checks herself out without saying goodbye to Victor. After his mother's funeral, Victor boards a plane. He goes to the bathroom and the door opens to reveal Paige joining him.

Production =Writing= In April 2001, following the video and DVD success of the film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's book Fight Club, the author sold feature film rights to his then- unpublished book Choke to Bandeira Entertainment under producer Beau Flynn. Flynn optioned Choke on the request of actor Clark Gregg, who had received the book as a writing assignment and became fascinated with Chokes unflinching way of dealing with \\"the difficult topics of childhood trauma and sexual compulsion in a way that was both painful and hysterically funny\\". Gregg worked on the book for five years, trying to adapt it faithfully. He decided to write his personal version of the story, believing that it would be one that Chuck Palahniuk would oppose. To Gregg's surprise, the author liked and supported the departures made in Gregg's version. Gregg described the difficulty of writing the script: \\"It's a tricky adaptation because like a lot of Chuck's work, it operates in a heightened satirical, dark world, yet this one is one of his black romantic comedies, so getting the tone right took me some time.\\" =Filming= Gregg was attached to film Choke in his directorial debut. Production was originally slated for 2006, but Gregg was temporarily occupied with a key role on the TV comedy series The New Adventures of Old Christine. By July 2007, Gregg cast actor Sam Rockwell in the lead role, as well as supporting cast members. Production began in the same month in New Jersey. Filming lasted 25 days with a budget of $3.4 million. Gregg had acted with Rockwell in a play, and the director believed that Rockwell would switch effortlessly between the dramatic and comedic moments in the film. A major filming location was the defunct Essex County Psychiatric Hospital in Cedar Grove. The hospital was considered a critical location by filmmakers, who believed that production would not have taken off without the discovered hospital, due to the project's minimal budget. As opposed to dark comedies that had a sustained tone, Gregg found Choke to be more tonally complex, and that it would veer between \\"extremely dramatic moments\\" and \\"absurdly silly ones\\". The director sought to find a way to combine the two elements, drawing inspiration from the Hal Ashby films Harold and Maude (1971) and Being There (1979) and contemporary films like Secretary (2002) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). In addition, the limited budget forced the director to consider economical measures throughout production. =Music= The song \\"Reckoner\\" from Radiohead's In Rainbows was used to play over the film's final credits. Palahniuk had said that the band would be writing the score for the film but a spokesman for the band later said that this was incorrect. The official soundtrack was released on iTunes on September 23, 2008. Release Choke premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2008, where it won a Special Jury Prize for a dramatic work by an ensemble cast. Having been positively received in its screening, the film was purchased for $5 million by Fox Searchlight Pictures for distribution. Choke was also the closing film for the 10th Provincetown International Film Festival in Provincetown, Massachusetts on June 22, 2008. The film was originally scheduled for a commercial release on August 1, 2008, but it was postponed to September 26, 2008. Critical response The film received mixed reviews from critics. , review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 55% based on 142 reviews, with an average rating 5.67/10, with the consensus that \\"While bolstered by strong performances from Sam Rockwell and Anjelica Huston, Choke struggles to capture the tone of Chuck Palahniuk's novel.\\" Metacritic gives the film an average score of 47/100, based on 27 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews.

History On the edge of the village is the site of a Marconi Beam Station from where telegrams were sent in 1927 to Australia and India as part of the Imperial Wireless Chain. When built it was state of the art and is important in the history of telecommunications because it established the first radio link between the United Kingdom and Australia. Only the bases for the masts remain; the original administration buildings are now a small industrial complex. Ordnance survey maps from the 1920s show an agricultural tramway running from the Humberstone Road (B1198) through Bishopthorpe to Low Farm. Such tramways often used WW1 narrow gauge trench railway equipment to allow year around access to soft fenland fields. The area is now a wind farm. Tetney Lock used to be the location of a heliport run by Bristow Helicopters which delivered personnel to North Sea oil and gas rigs, but this is now defunct, having operated from 1965 until the early 1970s. The hangars were converted into a turkey farm. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes North Coates and had a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 2,449. Geography and amenities The village is on the A1031 Cleethorpes to Mablethorpe coastal road, south of Humberston, and east from Holton-le-Clay. The village also includes the hamlet of Tetney Lock located to the east of the village on the Louth Navigation canal. The village facilities include the primary school, the Plough Inn public house, on the Market Place, a fish and chip shop, a village shop, a golf club, a garden centre, a Wesleyan chapel, a church and a village hall. The parish church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul. An inscription on the second pillar from the west on the north arcade states: \\"This work was completed A.D. 1363 Robert Day the vicar\\". Some parts of the building are from an earlier church which stood on the same spot, including a doorway dating from about 1280. The village hall is situated at the playing fields, on Humberston Road. The playing fields include a cricket pitch and football pitch - previously there existed a grass tennis court. Tetney United Football Club were based at the village hall and playing fields, and played in the East Lincs Combination Football League. To the east of the village on the road to Tetney Lock is an oil terminal which stores oil for the Humber Refinery. Oil has been delivered via the Tetney Monobuoy, since January 1971. Nature Tetney Blow Wells To the east of the village are the Tetney Marshes, which cover over 1,500 hectares of coastal mudflats, salt marsh, dunes and saline lagoons on the north Lincolnshire coast, the reserve forms an important part of the Humber Estuary Site of Special Scientific Interest and Special Protection Area, administered by the RSPB as the Tetney Marshes nature reserve, which functions as a grazing marsh and home of lagoon sand shrimps and little terns which live near saline lagoons. To the south of the village are the Tetney Blow Wells, a Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust nature reserve and SSSI. The Blow Wells are artesian springs flowing from the underlying chalk aquifer through the boulder clay to form a series of pools, which were used to supply a water cress farm from 1948 to 1961. The nature reserve is also a habitat for the cardinal beetle, and the Daubenton's bat or water bat.

Ballistic training, also called power training, is a form of training which involves throwing weights, and jumping with weights, in order to increase explosive power. The intention in ballistic exercises is to maximise the acceleration phase of an object's movement and minimise the deceleration phase. For instance, throwing a medicine ball maximises the acceleration of the ball; this can be contrasted with a standard weight training exercise where there would be a pronounced deceleration phase at the end of the repetition i.e. at the end of a bench press exercise the barbell is decelerated and brought to a halt. Similarly, an athlete jumping whilst holding a trap bar maximises the acceleration of the weight through the process of holding it whilst they jump; where as they would decelerate it at the end of a standard trap bar deadlift.Fleck, Steven J. & Kraemer, William J., 'Ballistic Training' in Designing Resistance Training Programmes, Human Kinetics:Leeds, 2013, p.280 History Depiction of a stone put training method from the Swiss Lucerne Chronicle, 1513. Note the preloading of the back leg. The word ballistic comes from the Greek word Œ≤Œ¨ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ (ballein), which means ‚Äúto throw‚Äù. Evidence of ballistic training can be seen throughout recorded history, especially in depictions which show the throwing of a large stone (stone put). Other ballistic disciplines from antiquity include the javelin throw and the discus throw. The hammer throw is a younger discipline, known from the 15th century. Such throws have been both a popular sporting pastime, and a training method employed by soldiers. Ballistic training was first used in the modern day by elite athletes when they were looking to enhance their ability to perform explosively. Commonly used modern ballistic training exercises are medicine ball throws, bench throws, jump squats, cleans, snatches, and push presses. Focus and effects Ballistic training forces the athlete's body to recruit and trigger fast twitch muscle fibers. This is important because these muscle fibers have the greatest potential for growth and strength. Ballistic training requires the muscles to adapt to contracting very quickly and forcefully. This training requires the central nervous system to coordinate and produce the greatest amount of force in the shortest time possible. In traditional weight training the athlete accelerates the weight on the concentric portion over the first third of the lift. During the other two-thirds of the lift, the weight is being slowed‚Äîdecelerated‚Äîand then stopped. With ballistic training, the weight is accelerated through the whole range of motion and only starts to decelerate after the athlete has released the bar. The National Strength and Conditioning Association's Basic Guidelines for the Resistance Training of Athletes states that \\"performing speed repetitions as fast as possible with light weight (e.g., 30‚Äì45% of 1-RM) in exercises in which the bar is held on to and must be decelerated at the end of the joint‚Äôs range of motion (e.g., bench press) to protect the joint does not produce power or speed training but teaches the body how to decelerate, or slow down. If the load can be released into the air (i.e., the bar be let go at the end of the range of motion) the negative effects are eliminated.\\" Additional research has shown that as much as 75% of a movement can be devoted to slowing the bar down. Elliot, et al. (1989) reported that during 1-RM bench presses, the bar decelerates for the final 24% of the range of motion. At 81% of 1-RM, the bar decelerates for the final 52% of the range of motion. Research has shown that for best results it is important to load the bar with the amount of weight that allows for positive acceleration to be maintained through the full range of motion for the lift. An effective ballistic lift develops speed throughout the entire range of motion of the lift until the moment of release. Criteria 1\\\\. Muscle recruitment principles. Ballistic lifts force the muscles to produce the greatest amount of force in the shortest amount of time. In accordance with Henneman's size principle muscle fibers are recruited from a low to a high threshold as force requirements increase. 2\\\\. Speed of the movement. To ensure full muscle fiber recruitment the speed of the lift must be propulsive through the entire range of the movement up until release. 3\\\\. Intensity of the exercise. The duration of the lift should be measured by repetitions or time. The lift should be stopped when the bar decelerates. Research has shown the 6-8 repetitions or 20‚Äì30 seconds produces the best results. 4\\\\. Cardiovascular benefits. Ballistic exercises performed continuously for a minimum of 20 seconds followed by a 30-second rest period and then repeated until deceleration occurs has been proven to elevate the heart rate to training zone level. 5\\\\. Co-ordination. Research at the University of Connecticut found that high-intensity training has profound effects on the nervous system. The exercise had to be of an intensity that elevate the heart rate to 90% of maximum rate and had to sustain that rate for at least 20 seconds. 6\\\\. Electronic measurement. There are several electronic measurement systems that measure the velocity, power, and effectiveness of a lift. The athlete should stop the lift when the speed of a lift has fallen to 90% of their previous lift. The 90% number signals that there has been a significant change in the recruitment of the fast-twitch muscle fibers. Below the 90% number the lift is no longer ballistic 7\\\\. Specificity of training. Ballistic training emphasizes throwing and jumping with a weighted object. Research has resulted in positive increases in vertical jump, throwing velocity, and running speed. There is limited transfer to a specific sport. Use in metabolic conditioning Ballistic exercises have traditionally been left out of metabolic conditioning workouts and training programs. This may be due to the fact that they are often technical lifts, or lifts/exercises for which technique is crucial to safe and effective completion. However, with the extensive availability of information and guidance in learning and developing proficiency in ballistic exercise, this trend is changing. Many training programs which employ circuit training or metabolic conditioning now include ballistic exercises such as kettlebell cleans and snatches, Olympic lifts and variations, throws and plyometric variations. The benefits of their inclusion in these types of programs include higher levels of motor unit recruitment, higher caloric burn and improvements in a number of measurable athletic outputs.

She was named in honor of Lieutenant Martin H. Ray, Jr., who was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously for his heroic actions during the last stages of the Battle of Midway, 6 June 1942. She was laid down 27 October 1943 by Consolidated Steel Corp., Orange, Texas; launched 23 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. M. H. Ray, Jr., widow of Lt. Ray, and commissioned 28 February 1944, Lt. H.

Ray spent 3 weeks at Norfolk, Virginia, training prospective destroyer escort crews. June 1944 marked the beginning of a 12-month period in which not one ship was lost by the 14 convoys she escorted.

Background  Isabel was born to a family closely associated with the exploration and conquest of the Americas. She was the third child of Pedro de Arias and Isabel de Bobadilla y Pe√±alosa. Pedro de Arias was one of conquerors of Central America and also the governor of Nicaragua. Isabel‚Äôs mother was niece to Beatriz de Bobadilla, a close acquaintance of Isabella I of Castile and served as the matriarch of two of the most powerful and richest families in Spain, the Bobadillas and Pe√±alosas. Isabel de Bobadilla (daughter) is also granddaughter to Francisco de Bobadilla, who was appointed to succeed Christopher Columbus as the second governor of the Indies in 1499.  Marriage and kinship  Isabel de Bobadilla married the prominent explorer and conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1537, who was in charge of one of the first European expeditions into what is now the United States. In 1535-36, Isabel must have been in her late twenties or early thirties, which suggests that she may have been a widow or, in some way, seen as an undesirable mate because women from powerful families were typically married before they reached their late twenties. The Conveyance of Dower is a document that was signed at Valladolid on November 14, 1536. The Conveyance of Dower lists all the cattle that had belonged to Pedro de Arias in Panama, the estate, the slaves, and the horses as a \\"pure and perfect gift irrevocable in favour.\\" This document verifies the wealth of Bobadilla‚Äôs family and also shows how Isabel's marriage to de Soto was a business arrangement between a very powerful Spanish family and an established conquistador. Hernando de Soto was named governor of Cuba and Adelantado de Florida, and both arrived in Cuba in 1538. Documents show that Isabel brought to Cuba her slaves, including three white slaves who were Christians, possibly baptized Moors. Within the first couple weeks of 1539, the first couple of Cuba purchased at least four plantations near the city of Havana, with the largest plantation at Cojimar on the coast just east of the bay.  Government  Isabel de Bobadilla was given power of attorney on May 17, 1539, when Hernando de Soto left Havana for the exploration and conquest of Florida [la Florida]. De Soto also appointed Juan de Rojas to serve as Bobadillas deputy in Havana and Francisco de Guzman to serve as her deputy in Santiago. Both of these men had served in this capacity before de Soto and Bobadilla arrived in Cuba. There were several political factions who were competing for power and control in Spain through exploration and control of unexplored territories. Among the important people involved in these \\"grand plans of exploration\\" were Alvar Nunez, Cabeza de Vaca, Hernan Cortes, Pedro de Alvarado, Hernando de Soto, and Antonio de Mendoza. This illustrates how in the midst of the Spanish conquistadors, Isabel de Bobadilla was appointed to a highly politicized and powerful role. Historians have conflicting opinions on why Isabel de Bobadilla was given the power to govern Cuba; M√°rquez Sterling indicates that Isabel was made governor only because de Soto did not want to stay in Cuba while surviving documents show that Isabel was the governor both de jure and de facto. Rodrigo Ranjel, de Soto‚Äôs private secretary in Cuba and la Florida, described Isabel as having inherited her mother‚Äôs fortitude, intelligence, and strength of character, and, like her mother, she was \\"a woman of great essence and goodness, and of very noble judgement and character.\\" De Soto also confirmed Isabel‚Äôs abilities by giving her the power of attorney, naming her governor of the island of Cuba. In 16th century Spain, it was extremely rare that a woman would be appointed to a high office position. Isabel became the first female governor of Cuba and the first woman governor of a territory in the Western Hemisphere. The only other woman who served in high office in the 16th century Spanish colonies was Aldonza Manrique of Venezuela, who inherited the governorship when her father, Marcelo Villalobas, died in 1526. Bobadilla was also acknowledged as governor by the King of Spain in letters directly sent to her. As the governor, Isabel was able to handle many issues faced by all New World governors, including problems between the Indigenous Cubans and Europeans. Isabel Bobadilla contributed to the fortification of Cuba against rivals by advancing the construction of Havana‚Äôs first fortress La Fuerza. La Fuerza was finished by Isabel de Bobadilla to defend the city against frequent enemy attacks; nevertheless, French pirates led by Jacques de Sores sacked Havana and burned La Fuerza in 1555.  Lawsuit against Ponce de Leon  Isabel de Bobadilla filed a 3,720 page lawsuit, known as Justicia, against Hern√°n Ponce de Le√≥n covering the time period of 1540‚Äì45. Ponce de Leon was a former partner of de Soto in his explorations of Peru and Nicaragua. The lawsuit recounts the controversies among the inheritors of De Soto and Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, Hernan Cortes, and the viceroy of Mexico; and also includes de Soto‚Äôs Residencia, which was the investigation carried out in 1554 (after his death) to determine whether or not he had fulfilled all of his responsibilities outlined in his asiento. Ponce de Leon claimed that de Soto did not fulfill his obligations by not equally sharing his new found fortune and wealth from the Peru and Nicaragua explorations. Hern√°n Ponce de Le√≥n and Hernando de Soto arrived at an agreement over this issue, before de Soto left for his Florida expedition. However, when de Soto left, Hern√°n secretly took legal action saying that de Soto did not fulfill their previous agreement and that de Soto intimidated him into signing the agreement. Dona Isabel heard of this legal action, when she was appointed governor, and had seized the document from Ponce de Leon. She then waited for a ship that was in Havana harbor bound for Spain to leave, leaving Hern√°n with no way out of Cuba, then sent him a letter asking why he had behaved so badly. As the governor, she ordered Ponce de Leon not to leave Havana until he had renounced his secret legal action and drew up a document, that Ponce de Leon would sign, repudiating his repudiation. Dona Isabel was an able and strong leader who used her power to promote her self-interest as seen in this lawsuit against a powerful Spanish conquistador. There is no further information on how this lawsuit concluded.  Death and legend  = Death = In December 1543, Rodrigo Arangel brought the news to Dona Isabel in Havana of de Soto‚Äôs death. After his death, Isabel auctioned off thousands of items belonging to her and her husband before she left Cuba for Spain. These items included everything from a ranch at Maybeque, complete with native laborers, several hundred heads of cattle, and 500 yucca plants to Soto‚Äôs house in Havana containing eighteen household slaves, a rosary made of thirty-two solid-gold beads, and a collar and cap made of black velvet. After auctioning off her and her husband items she raised \\"more than four thousand pesos of gold,\\" which she used to move back to Spain. The circumstances of Isabel de Bobadilla‚Äôs death are uncertain. Some people claim she moved back to Spain with the money she received while others believe that after she heard of her husband‚Äôs death, she was \\"broke with grief upon hearing it, and a few days later she died. = Legend = La Giraldilla is a bronze wind statue of a woman who is surveying the horizon to her north and is located on top of the Castillo de la Real Fuerza in old Havana, Cuba. The local Cuban people claim that this bronze statue is a depiction of Dona Isabel de Bobadilla and it is suggested that it was placed there to honor In√®s de Bobadilla,\\"Castillo de la Real Fuerza\\" (in Spanish).

As of 1 July 2017 Narsdorf has been incorporated into Geithain. The villages of Ossa (with Bruchheim, Kolka, Wenigossa, and Niederpickenhain), and Rathendorf (with Oberpickenhain) had been incorporated administratively into Narsdorf in 1996, while nearby Seifersdorf had already been incorporated in 1934 and D√∂litzsch in 1973.Informationen √ºber Narsdorf beim Landkreis Leipzig  Geography  Narsdorf is located about 42 km south-southeast of Leipzig and 25 km north-northwest of Chemnitz on Bundesstra√üe B175 and motorway A 72, immediately west of Wechselburg and south of Geithain. It has a station on the Neukieritzsch‚ÄìChemnitz railway. With the exception of D√∂litzsch in the southeast, most of the incorporated communities lie to the west of Narsdorf proper. Hegeteich, a large pond in Narsdorf municipality Narsdorf is situated in the landscape of Kohrener Land which is part of the Central Saxon Hills and the Saxon Loess country. The area is rich in clay which is mined and processed into roof tiles. Woodlands are mainly found in the western part of the municipality. Bodies of water include ponds and a flooded clay pit as well as several streams of which Katze and Ratte are the main ones.  History  The oldest recorded part of Narsdorf is the Waldhufendorf Seifersdorf which was first mentioned as Sifridesdorp in a document of 1208. Until the 18th century it was partly administrated by the magistrate of Geithain and the √Ñmter of Borna (Syhra manor) and Rochlitz (Ossa manor). In 1934 it was incorporated into Narsdorf. The Waldhufendorf Narsdorf itself was first mentioned in 1350 as Nordinsdorff and was founded during the German eastward expansion in the 13th century as a settlement in a woodland clearing. Around 1424 it is supposed to have been temporarily abandoned due to a plague outbreak. In the early modern period it belonged to Amt Rochlitz. D√∂litzsch, a clustered settlement, was also first mentioned in 1350. It was part of K√∂nigsfeld manor in Amt Rochlitz and joined Narsdorf municipality in 1973. Ossa, the seat of a former manor and temporarily also referred to as Gro√üossa, which had incorporated Wenigossa with Niederpickenhain, Bruchheim, and Kolka in 1948, joined Narsdorf municipality in 1996 together with Rathendorf, which had incorporated Oberpickenhain in 1956. Old station buildings In 1872 the railway station (only a halt since 2006) was opened together with the branch line to Penig and Rochlitz which closed in sections between 1991 and 2000.

Military career Hart hailed from New Orleans and commanded soldiers from the Fifth Louisiana Regiment during the war.Hart's journal (which chronicles, albeit briefly Hart's military service from July 4, 1864, through the end of the spring of 1865) A veteran of many battles, Hart led troops in the Confederate victories at the Second Battle of Winchester (see Winchester II Confederate order of battle), and Second Battle of Kernstown (which Hart noted in his journal). Hart recorded in his journal that his regiment also participated in pushing back Union troops at the Battle of Smithfield Crossing. During the Battle of Strasburg, Hart's regiment captured numerous Union troops. Hart noted in his journal that his regiment \\"Captured a Lt. Col. And some dirty non-coms. Officers and men.\\" Some sources claim that Hart fought at the Battle of Monocacy (see Monocacy Confederate order of battle), but his journal makes no mention of this battle. Rather, Hart records traveling with his troops across Virginia on the date of the battle. Hart also led his regiment at Gettysburg (see Gettysburg Confederate order of battle). Hart mentions in his journal that he was injured in battle upon at least two occasions‚Äîfirst at Antietam and at the Battle of Opequon. Simon Wolf's 1895 book, The American Jew as Patriot, Soldier and Citizen, notes that Hart first held the rank of a non- commissioned colonel before being commissioned as a major in 1863. After returning to Confederate territory as part of a prisoner exchange, Hart later was assigned to the general staff of a Montgomery, Alabama-based General Williams. Religious/Personal life Hart was born in New Orleans, the oldest of Isaac and Julia Hart's twelve children. He married his fianc√©e, Leonora Levy, (mentioned in his journal entry dated November 30, 1864, as \\"Leonna\\") in Richmond, Virginia, August 15, 1866, and had four children. (See the Hart family genealogy). Two of Leonora's brothers also fought for the Confederacy, including Captain Ezekiel \\"Zeke\\" Levy and Isaac J. Levy, both of the 46th Virginia Infantry. The latter was killed in action on Sunday, August 21, 1864, just shy of his twenty-second birthday. Isaac J. Levy's tombstone contains descriptions of his valor and commitment to his faith. One such example of his adherence to the strictures of Jewish observance are contained in a letter to his sister, Leonora, in which he describes the observance of his last Passover in 1864. Captain Ezekiel Levy is mentioned in Hart's diary's April 2, 1865, entry. Hart's sister-in-law (Leonora's sister), Sarah Levy, married Corporal Edwin I. Kursheedt, a soldier in the Louisiana Washington Artillery battalion. Many Jewish soldiers are listed as having fought under Hart in The American Jew as Patriot, Soldier and Citizen. Among the Jewish officers who fought in the Louisiana Fifth were Lieutenant L.S. Lipman, who died in battle May 9, 1863, and is buried in the Cemetery for Hebrew Confederate Soldiers in Richmond, Virginia, and Captain David Cohen Labatt. About Labatt, the book notes that \\"...in consequence of severe illness, contracted in the service, resulting in chronic asthma, Captain Labat was compelled to resign his commission, J. Bankhead Magruder, the General commanding, endorsed the Captain's letter of resignation with the words: 'Captain Labat's resignation is a loss to the public service.'\\" It is probable that, while in New Orleans, Hart worshiped at the Shangarai Chasset (Gates of Mercy) congregation. (In 1873 this congregation merged with another New Orleans Jewish congregation to form the present-day New Orleans Touro Synagogue.) In his journal, while leaving Richmond by train on April 2, 1865, Hart mentions that \\"Be. Florance was...there.\\" A Benjamin Florance (as well as an Isaac Hart, likely his father) are listed among the founding trustees of that New Orleans synagogue in the December 1843 issue of the Occident and American Jewish Advocate. Hart briefly writes in his journal about his observance of the Passover holiday during 1865 en route to serve General Williams. Hart settled after the war in Staunton, Virginia, where, in 1876, he continued the family's commitment to Jewish community by organizing and becoming the founding president of the Temple House of Israel synagogue, a position he held for eighteen years. The building which housed Hart's original congregation still stands in central Staunton. As the Jewish community in nearby Harrisonburg, Virginia, became more organized and established a Sunday school for the young, Hart provided guidance. John Wayland, in his History of Rockingham County (c. 1912) writes that in 1890 \\"Major Hart of Staunton...\\" confirmed the first class in the congregation's \\"...new place of worship.\\" Robert Rosen, in The Jewish Confederates, notes that after living in Staunton, Hart moved to Norfolk, Virginia. He was active in the Confederate War Veterans, serving as a commander in the Pickett-Buchananan Camp in Norfolk. Hart was reported to have led services in the Ohef Sholom Temple when the rabbi was absent. Hart died in ten days shy of his seventy-second birthday, and was buried in Norfolk.

US WEST was the first RBOC to consolidate its Bell Operating Companies (followed by other was BellSouth). =Expansion into cable= U S WEST Media Group logo, 1995‚Äì1998 In order to segregate its regulated telephone service from its unregulated cable TV businesses, US WEST Inc separated their assets and businesses into two groups named US WEST Communications Group and US WEST Media Group and issued separate tracking shares for the each company. These tracking shares reflected results and prospects of the group's business, and would be traded separately. The Media Group's ticker symbol was \\"UMG\\" while Communications group continued with the \\"USW\\" ticker. In 1995, the cable modem service was later renamed to MediaOne Express. The company completed a co- branding deal with Time Warner's cable modem Internet business under which MediaOne would become MediaOne RoadRunner. Acquisitions In 1996, U S WEST acquired Continental Cablevision for $5.3 billion in stock and renamed it MediaOne (initially named Media1). Amos B. Hostetter, Jr., a founder and former chairman and CEO of Continental resigned after U S WEST moved the company's headquarters from Boston, Massachusetts. In time the service also included pay-per-view, and a self-branded high-speed cable modem internet service named Hiway1 (Highway One). Hiway1 was an early provider of the cable modem technology.Due to the early adoption of the technology, customers could not yet have access to any bi-directional communication via the cable modem. Hiway1's cable company's infrastructure was incapable of two-way communication. The customer would only be able to use the Hiway1's cable modem for downlink and a regular in-home modem (presumably over the telephone line) for uplink communication. Most early-period modems for the service were created by the manufacturer LANcity (Bay Networks). =Name change= In 1998, US WEST Inc spun off its telephone and non-telephone assets into two separate companies. US WEST, Inc., later changing its name to MediaOne Group, Inc. and U S WEST Communications and U S WEST Dex divisions to a new entity incorporated in Delaware named US WEST, Inc. The \\"new\\" US WEST was then spun off to shareholders of Communications Group stock. The split became effective June 12, 1998. Chuck Lillis became CEO of MediaOne Group. =Acquisition by AT&T;= In 1999, Comcast first made a bid for MediaOne. Comcast said they would pay $60 billion and assume all of MediaOne's debt. On May 6, 1999 AT&T;, not wanting to be outdone promised about $62 billion instead, and paid a break up fee of $1.5 billion allowing MediaOne to be purchased by AT&T.; MediaOne RoadRunner et al. next became AT&T; branded. The portion which ran television was \\"AT&T; Cable Television\\", another part for Internet became known as \\"AT&T; Broadband Internet\\" and the third became \\"AT&T; Digital Phone\\". The buyout of MediaOne by AT&T; happened close on the heels of AT&T;'s other cable company purchase TCI. That buyout by TCI already made AT&T; the largest cable company, and MediaOne only served to increase their margin of leadership. In the summer of 2000, AT&T; Broadband purchased the cable television system serving the city of Boston, then controlled by New York-based Cablevision, for $1.1 billion in stock, cash and a trade of other cable systems. The deal effectively made the Boston/New England region MediaOne's largest clustered market. In exchange for the Boston system, Cablevision also received several of AT&T; Broadband's systems which served suburban New York communities. AT&T; was unable to make the merger work for many reasons, and split the company into three separate companies: AT&T; Corp. continued and retained its long distance business, AT&T; Wireless Services was spun off as a public company, and AT&T; Broadband was purchased by Comcast. At this point, MediaOne became known as Comcast MO Group, Inc. = Criticisms = US WEST, as a telephone service provider, was accused by critics of failing to meet service needs within a reasonable time frame and of practicing predatory billing and collection methods. While the company often claimed that subscriber demands were often greater than their ability to fulfill orders, many critics pointed to high profit margins, spending on bring-to-market technology and lackluster investment in customer support. US WEST went through a period of union- management relations that bordered on positive during the early 1990s. After a failed re-engineering strategy, relations fell apart due to increasing hostility between company leaders and employees. When the company rolled out its new slogan ‚Äì \\"Life's better here\\" ‚Äì employees began wearing buttons and shirts that stated that \\"Life's Bitter Here\\". The company was fined multiple times by the State of Oregon for these practices during the 1990s. S WEST was also, at several times, involved in smaller litigation with other states within its service area for similar complaints from customers. Qwest, MCI, and smaller competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) who had recently been allowed to offer local service within US WEST's service area (as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996) complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that U S WEST was uncooperative in releasing their formerly owned lines to these new companies. These types of complaints landed US WEST in court yet again, offering the complex question of whether or not the government could legally offer the sale of owned property to other companies in the event of deregulation. In 1996, reports appearing in The Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News revealed that CLECs had lodged complaints with the FCC against US WEST, including multiple complaints from Qwest Communications International, Inc. The complaints alleged US WEST neglected or seriously delayed release of \\"bundled loops\\" as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, making it difficult for competitors to provide local telephone service to their customers. Other competitors began following suit, and charged US WEST with monopoly-like or anti-trust type behavior. Many customers criticized AT&T; over the transitioning from Mediaone.net to attbroadband.com and subsequently attbi.com email addresses.[Mediaone.net domain name change: A warning] A final subsequent change from attbi.com to Comcast.net also drew further criticism from the company's longest customers who may have gone through the several prior email changes.

In 1942, Pekuri changed his name from Lauri Ohukainen. This older name can still be found in aviation literature. Early history Lauri Pekuri began flying as a youth in the 1930s Helsinki. He left college to participate in the Civic guards and sports. On his first attempt to join the Finnish Air Force he failed in the psychological tests and due to his bad academic record. Instead he became an NCO at the Mikkeli artillery battery. In 1939 he tried out again for the air force and was admitted. He had then completed his interrupted college studies. Fighter pilot Pekuri was sent to Parola and Tyrv√§nt√∂ during the Winter War where he got to fly second- line Gloster Gamecocks, Bristol Bulldogs and ASJA Jaktfalk fighters. He managed to accumulate about 100 flying hours. After the Winter War, he applied to the officer's school. In 1941, he was sent to H√§vitt√§j√§lentolaivue 24, which flew Brewster Buffaloes. In order to fly these fighters, he trained on Fokker D.XXIs. On 4 October 1941, Pekuri fought his first air battle against a Soviet I-153 fighter, which crashed mainly due to pilot error. Pekuri continued to better his kill statistics over the following years. On 25 June 1942, Pekuri participated in a large aerial battle over the Soviet Sekehe airfield. He managed to down two Soviet Hawker Hurricanes, but his Brewster Buffalo (BW-372) was also hit and he was forced to make an emergency landing on a lake. He made it safely to his own lines, but the aircraft sank to the bottom. The aircraft was located and recovered in the 1990s; it is the only surviving Brewster Buffalo today. In the fights over Sekehe, the Soviets lost seven aircraft. Pekuri's FAF BW-372 on display at the Aviation Museum of Central Finland In February 1943, Pekuri participated in the obtaining of Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2 fighters from Germany. The aircraft were transported from Neustadt, near Vienna. The Germans were surprised that not one single plane was destroyed during transport, when they themselves suffered losses up to 20% since they employed less qualified pilots to do the work. During a flight from Immola to Lappeenranta on June 16, 1944, Pekuri's aircraft was damaged while engaging an Ilyushin Il-2. The engine stopped and he had to bail out behind enemy lines. He wandered for over a week towards his own lines, but was finally captured and sent to a prison in Leningrad. He was released in December 1944. After medical quarantine and recovery he returned to his squadron. Contrary to the original plans, this squadron of Bf 109s did not participate to the Lapland War due to a similar type used by Germans, and the dangers of misidentification. Pekuri achieved 18.5 victories in World War II (12.5 with Buffaloes and 6 with Bf 109s). After World War II, Pekuri rejoined the Air Force and took part in transforming the air force into the jet age. He became the first Finnish citizen to break the sound barrier, in an RAF Folland Gnat F.1 numbered GN-101, flying in passive glide in Finnish airspace. He flew and evaluated Folland Gnats and was responsible on ensuring the purchased fighters fulfilled the terms of agreement. After the purchase of Gnats had been completed, Pekuri evaluated the MiG-19 fighter. In his report, he recommended against purchasing the aircraft. The main reasons given were that the weapons were insufficient (giving the impression that no air-to-air missiles were usable) and that manufacturing had been terminated in favour of soon-to-be Mach 2-class fighters already planned for the Soviet air force.H√§vitt√§j√§lent√§j√§ pp. 299-300 Pekuri also participated in the evaluation of MiG-21 fighters that were to be purchased to Finland. Pekuri planned the training for the type based on Soviet training both theoretical and practical given to group of pilots including himself. The fighters were transferred to Finland by Soviet pilots which was on the terms of the purchase.H√§vitt√§j√§lent√§j√§ p. 316 During evaluations of future fighters, Pekuri was the first Finnish pilot to break Mach 2 flying a Dassault Mirage III.H√§vitt√§j√§lent√§j√§ p. 311 Pekuri finally retired in 1968 with the rank of colonel, having commanded the Carelian Wing. After his military career, he worked in civilian aviation, as the manager of the aviation maintenance training for Wihuri Oy. In the 1980s he moved to Spain where he wrote his memoirs. He died on August 3, 1999. Sources * Keskinen, Kalevi; Stenman, Kari and Niska, Klaus. H√§vitt√§j√§-√§ss√§t (Finnish Fighter Aces). Espoo, Finland: Tietoteas, 1978. .

Biography Jackson was born in Hernando, Mississippi. The researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc date his birth as 1876, but other sources give 1884 or 1890. He was raised on a farm, where he learned to play guitar. Around 1905 he started working as a singer, dancer, and musician in medicine shows and played at dances and parties, often with other local musicians, such as Gus Cannon, Frank Stokes and Robert Wilkins. He soon began travelling with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels, featuring Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, and other minstrel shows. He also played in clubs on Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. His popularity and proficiency secured him a residency at the prestigious Peabody Hotel in Memphis in 1919. Like Lead Belly, Jackson knew hundreds of songs, including blues, ballads, vaudeville numbers, and traditional tunes, and became a popular attraction. In 1927 the talent scout H. C. Speir obtained for him a recording contract with Vocalion Records. On October 10, 1927, he recorded \\"Jim Jackson's Kansas City Blues\\", which became a best-seller. Its melody and lyrics can be traced in many later blues and rock and roll songs, including \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" and \\"Kansas City\\". Following this hit Jackson recorded a series of \\"Kansas City\\" follow- ups and soundalikes. Other artists recorded cover versions of the song (including William Harris in 1928) and reworked it (as Charlie Patton did, changing it to \\"Gonna Move to Alabama.\\") Jackson moved to Memphis in 1928 and made a series of further recordings, including the comic medicine show song \\"I Heard the Voice of a Pork Chop\\". He also appeared in King Vidor's all-black 1929 film Hallelujah!; it is unclear what role he played. Jackson ran the Red Rose Minstrels, a travelling medicine show which toured Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama. As a talent scout for Brunswick Records, he discovered Rufus \\"Speckled Red\\" Perryman, gaining him his first recording session.Silvester, Peter J. (1989). A Left Hand Like God: A History of Boogie-Woogie Piano. pp. 112‚Äì113. Da Capo Press. . Shortly afterwards, in February 1930, Jackson recorded his last session. He later moved back to Hernando and continued to perform until his death in 1933. Legacy Janis Joplin later recorded a version of \\"Kansas City Blues\\", inserting the lyrics \\"Babe, I'm leavin', yeah I'm a-leavin' this mornin' / Goin' to Kansas City to bring Jim Jackson home\\". Jackson was a major influence on the Chicago bluesman J. B. Lenoir. Jackson's \\"Kansas City Blues\\" was a regular fixture of Robert Nighthawk's concert set list. Brownie McGhee said \\"Kansas City Blues\\" was \\"the first tune that I ever learned to play.\\" (Seattle Folklore Society video). The song \\"Wild About My Lovin'\\" was covered by the Lovin' Spoonful and released on their 1965 debut album, Do You Believe in Magic.

It contains thousands of ancient archaeological artefacts from the ancient Greek, Roman, Etruscan and Cypriot civilizations. Its main attraction is the Pergamon Altar and Greek and Roman architectural elements from Priene, Magnesia, Baalbek and Falerii. In addition, the collection includes a large number of ancient sculptures, vases, terracottas, bronzes, sarcophagi, engraved gems and metalwork.  History of the collection  = Foundation = The collection's foundations were laid in the time of the Brandenburg Elector Friedrich Wilhelm I by ancient sculptures looted in 1656 from the Villa Regia Palace in Warsaw.Kr√≥l W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV zgromadzi≈Ç w pa≈Çacu sw√≥j zbi√≥r antycznych rze≈∫b, kt√≥re p√≥≈∫niej pad≈Çy ≈Çupem elektora brandenburskiego Fryderyka Wilhelma Hohenzollerna. The obtained sculptures were purchased in Italy by Polish kings Sigismund III Vasa and W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa. This core of the collection, originally housed at the Berlin City Castle, was enlarged through acquisitions, including the acquisition of the collection of Gerrit Reynst in 1671. Acquisitions continued in 1698 when Friedrich III bought the important collection belonging to the Roman archaeologist Giovanni Pietro Bellori. After a longer interval, in which Friedrich Wilhelm I exchanged, among other things, 36 valuable statues for two dragoon regiments with Augustus II the Strong, followed in 1742 by Friedrich II's purchase of the collection of cardinal Melchior de Polignac, which included the well-known figure of the \\"girl playing a game of knucklebones\\". He acquired in 1747 the already famous bronze statue of the so-called \\"praying boy\\", which was set up on the terrace of the Schloss Sanssouci until 1786. the collection was significantly expanded in 1758 through the inheritance of the Markgr√§fin von Ansbach-Bayreuth's collection, which included the \\"Nile mosaic\\" from Praeneste, and in 1764 through the purchase of Philipp von Stosch's antique gem collection. The majority of the antiquities were scattered among the royal castles in the 1770s, or shown in a specially built ancient temple in Potsdam where they were not accessible to the public. 1797 saw the first thoughts of public access, with the plan to erect a public museum in Berlin to show off the most important pieces in the royal collections, among other things. A commission under the direction of Wilhelm von Humboldt was appointed to select the exhibits. At the same time as this new museum was coming into existence, further important purchases were made, for example in 1827 the collection of bronzes and vases belonging to the consul-general Bartholdy and in 1828 the collection of 1348 antique vases belonging to the general Franz Freiherr von Koller. = The collection to 1939 = The collection found its first home in the Karl Friedrich Schinkel's 1830 building (now the Altes Museum) in the Lustgarten next to the Stadtschloss. The collection was predominantly Greek and Roman in the beginning, though it also included some medieval and modern sculptures. In the course of the 19th century, many further purchases were made, including in 1831 the Dorow-Magnus collection of 442 vases. The vase collection was expanded significantly in the following years by the bequest of the archaeologist Eduard Gerhard's collection and became one of the best in the world. The building's central room was the Rotunda, one of the earliest examples of purpose-built museum architecture, in which was exhibited the first display of sculptures, as chosen by von Humboldt's commission. Off it extended two halls, one of classical gods, the other of classical heroes, to which were joined two rooms with statues of Roman emperors, portraits, sarcophagi, cinerary urns and reliefs. Small objects were initially housed in the Antiquarium room. The new museum's first director was the sculptor Christian Friedrich Tieck, and its first archeological curator (from 1833 to 1855) Eduard Gerhard. Even at this stage - thanks to Gerhard - the focus was not merely on displaying works of art, but also on scientific research and development, then a novelty in museums. A sign of this scientific approach was the beginnings of a systematic catalogue (with drawings) of the museum's ancient artworks from Italy and Greece. This collection of drawings grew fast and its 2500 leaves are used by researchers even in the present day. During his term of office, Gerhard did not restrict himself to acquiring 'star objects', but instead tried to look at the whole breadth of the collection and to expand it in a variety of areas. In order to produce a complete overview of ancient art-history, he also went against opposition to casts and encouraged their acquisition by the collection instead of expensive original statues. The cast collection - in existence since 1796 at Berlin's Prussian Academy of Arts - was connected to the museum in 1842. In the following decades, the collection expanded to become one of the largest of its type. The combination of originals and copies in time came to support the Museum's encouragement of research and scholarship. The old museum-building soon became too small for the collection and a further building, the Neues Museum (New Museum), was built by Friedrich August St√ºler between 1843 and 1855 to the north of the original building. In this new building, ideas of arranging the archeological collections into a full chronological and conceptual timeline began to become reality. In the lower floor of the museum the Egyptian collection (which had already existed for some years but not been accessible to the public) was put on show, whilst on the upper floor, the cast collection was set up according to designs by St√ºler. The rooms' decor and wall paintings were designed specifically to fit the relevant subject or epoch. This new layout, however, did not last long, as in 1879 the vases collection was moved out of the Antiquarium into the new building. Even though the vase collection had outgrown the storage capacity of the old building, the available space was still not enough, so in 1883 it was decided to separate off the post-ancient sculptures into their own collection, to be housed in the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum (now known as the Bode Museum, or the Skulpturensammlung und Museum f√ºr Byzantinische Kunst i.e. the Sculpture Collection and Museum for Byzantine Art) that was already in the planning stages. Yet the 1884 purchase of the collection of Peter Alexandrovich SaburovIn French, \\"Sabouroff\\", hence \\"the Sabouroff Painter\\". again caused an acute shortage of space. To expand of the collection, the museum had since 1875 carried out its own excavations around the Mediterranean, starting with the ruins of Olympia. In 1878 Carl Humann and Alexander Conze began excavations in Pergamon, which brought the Museum its most famous object, the Pergamon Altar. Further excavations followed in Priene, Magnesia, Miletus and Baalbek, but these excavations entailed new problems. The collection was enriched in the early 20th century by acquisitions as well as by excavations, such as that of smaller objects belonging to Friedrich L. von Gans in 1912, the glass collection purchased in 1913 from M. von Rath, the \\"Thronende G√∂ttin\\" (Enthroned Goddess) in 1916, the statue of a woman holding an apple in 1925, and a collection of mummy portraits from the Fayum in 1929. For the presentation of all these pieces of ancient architecture, another new museum building was required. Between 1897 and 1899, the architect Fritz Wolff created the first Pergamon Museum. It was opened 1901 and in its light well was displayed the Pergamon altar and other architectural examples. Yet problems with the foundations soon led to its closure and demolition closed and dismantled. Wilhelm von Bode in 1907 planned a new building, begun in 1912, but World War I and the Wall Street Crash caused building work to come repeatedly to a standstill. In 1930, at the collection's centenary, a new museum (named the Pergamonmuseum from 1958) could be delivered finally at the public, designed by Alfred Messel and built by Ludwig Hoffmann. The three existing middle halls were reserved for ancient art. The old left wing became the Deutsche Museum, to relieve severe space problems at the Kaiser-Friedrich- Museum. The right wing was reserved for the Near East collection and the museum of Islamic art. The three middle halls - after large extensions were added - were able to present ancient architecture to its full height, with innovative use of natural light. There was no discussion as to the form of this presentation, leading to some embittered disputes that became known as the \\"Berliner Museumskrieg\\" (\\"Berlin museum war\\"). Through connections between the three archaeological museums, from 1930 until the museums' closure on the outbreak of war in 1939 visitors were able to undertake a tour through the early high cultures of ancient Egypt, the ancient Near East and the antique world for the next nine years. = The \\"Kriegsinferno\\" = In 1941, safeguarding the objects with sandbags and other measures began. What could be moved was largely taken to the Flakt√ºrme at the Berlin Zoo and at Friedrichshain, and in the vaults of the Berlin Mint. With the bombing becoming worse, these places (especially the Flak-towers) seemed unsuitable, and on 10 March 1945 it was decided to move the artworks to mines west of Berlin. After about ten convoys had started to move the collections there, however, it became too dangerous to do so, and this was postponed to the first week of April. So a large part of the small art and the supply of the magazines of the antique collection was instead taken to the Grasleben mines and to Kaiserroda in Thuringia. In the course of the war, the Altes Museum and the Neue Museum were destroyed, and the Museumsneubau and some of the exhibits were damaged. In spite of the concern over their safety, the art treasures in the Flakt√ºrmen were hardly damaged during the Battle of Berlin. The worst, however, came after the end of the battle, with the guards everywhere deserting their posts and leaving all the stores to be plundered by both Germans and Russians. In two fires in the Flakturm Friedrichshain in May 1945 a large part of the art treasures stored there was probably destroyed including several antiquities. Others were confiscated by the Red Army and taken back to Moscow and Leningrad as \\"spoils of war\\", and have still not been returned. How much was taken in this way is still unknown; 25 Greek vases that can be shown to belong to the Berlin collection were shown in 2005 at an exhibition entitled \\"Archaeology of the War\\" in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. Further vases were discovered in the Muscovite Historic Museum. Several vases, that were loaned in 1903 to the Provincial-Museum at Pozna≈Ñ (13 of the 19 vases are demonstrably from the Berlin collection), and several portrait busts that were loaned from 1908 to the Schloss there, were subsumed by Poland in 1945 into the Muzeum Narodowe in Pozna≈Ñ, where they are still held today. How great the losses were over the whole collection could first be investigated and documented after the reunification of the collection, with the first catalogue of losses appearing in 2005. This catalogue named five large bronze statues (including the \\"Calvatone Victory\\"), approximately 300 marble and stone statues, more than 40 reliefs, more than 20 stone architectural elements, approximately 30 stone vases, more than 1500 vases and vase- fragments (including pieces by the Amasis Painter, Berlin Painter, Brygos Painter, Edinburgh Painter, Exekias, Geras Painter and Pan Painter), 100 pieces of gold jewellery and more than 150 engraved gems. = The collection divided =  The collection on the Museum Island  In 1958 the USSR returned much of this war bounty to the GDR, but with both the Altes and Neue Museum destroyed a new home was acutely needed for the collections on the Museums Island. The three middle halls of the Pergamon Museum once again housed architectural exhibits, and the central hall again housed the Pergamon Altar. In the right-hand Room was housed Roman architecture, and in the right Wing itself the Near East Museum on the first floor and the Islamic Art museum on the upper floor (as it had been before 1939). In the left hall was housed Greek architecture, with ancient sculptures (formerly in the Altes Museum) in the left wing, and for a short time ancient coins were displayed in the M√ºnzkabinett Berlin. On the upper floor were Roman portraits, Etruscan art and choice pieces from the collection of small-objects. There was no room, however, for the art of ancient Cyprus until the Altes Museum was rebuilt and these objects had to remain in storage. A new entrance was formed in 1982, that led now directly into the middle hall and, from there, to the Pergamon Altar. In 1983‚Äì84 the ancient sculptures were redisplayed, this time in a chronological sequence, beginning with archaic Greek art, through classical originals, Hellenistic sculptures and Roman copies of classical originals, and ending with Roman art. Kept out of the international art market, the collection was restricted to maintaining and presenting the existing collection on the Museum Island. Only in a few cases could the collection be enriched by new acquisitions, such as an outstanding Greek marble relief of two horsemen and seven precious vases from private owners.  The collection in Charlottenburg  Also in 1958 the objects that had been evacuated to Thuringia during the war (then moved by the Americans to Celle in West Germany) were returned to Berlin. Though a repatriation to the Museum Island was out of the question, other homes were found for the objects. In 1961 the antiquities (already on public display from 1960 in St√ºler's barrack buildings at the Schloss at Charlottenburg) were placed in the charge of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. The objects displayed were the core of the collection of small artworks (including the well-known bronze statue of the \\"Cretan ram-carrier\\"), most of the former vase collection, the ancient gold jewellery collection (including the Hildesheim silver hoard), parts of the glass collection, the existing mummy portrait collections (with the addition of one of the few surviving ancient panel paintings, the Severus Tondo), and the collection of ancient helmets from Lipperheide. The display of antiquities, including the arrangement of the treasure chamber in the first floor of the St√ºler building, was expanded in 1976. In 1987 the first floor became home to the vases from Magna Graecia, upon which the arrangement of the antiquities collection was complete and extensive. In contrast to its East Berlin counterpart, the collection had access to the international art market, and was able to make its first postwar acquisition in 1958, the \\"torso of a falling wounded man\\". Up until reunification, as well as the existing material on the museum island, more than 600 new works of art were acquired by purchases and donation. These included numerous ancient vases (among others, the Altamura Painter, Berlin Painter, Brygos Painter, Chiusi Painter, KY Painter, Myson, Pan Painter, Paseas, Pistoxenos Painter, Smikros and the Triptolemos Painter), numerous marble busts (including a portrait bust of Cleopatra VII), sculptures (including a feminine idol of the Cycladic culture) and sarcophagus (among others, a large sarcophagus of a Roman general well known since the 16th century). Along with these single acquisitions, some larger complexes also came into the possession of the Museum. In 1976 an ancient coin from Heinrich Amersdorffer's collection, gold jewellery from Tarentum in 1980, a vase collection from a grave in Tarentum in 1984 (including ones by the Armidale Painter, the Dareios Painter, the painter of Copenhagen 4223, the Loebbecke Painter, the Lucera Painter, the Underworld Painter and the Varrese Painter) and the contents of a late Roman grave in Cologne in 1986. = The collection re-united =  References   Further reading  * Belser Kunstbibliothek, Die Meisterwerke aus dem Antikenmuseum Berlin, Stuttgart / Z√ºrich 1980 * Gerhard and Ursula Stelzer, Bilderhandbuch der Kunstsammlungen in der DDR, Leipzig 1984 * Exhibition catalogue, Weltsch√§tze der Kunst ‚Äì der Menschheit bewahrt, Berlin 1985 * Wolf-Dieter Heilmeyer (eds.): Antikenmuseum Berlin ‚Äì Die ausgestellten Werke, Berlin 1988 * Rudolf Fellmann (ed.): Antike Welt im Pergamon- und Bodemuseum, von Zabern, Mainz 1990 (Sonderhefte zur \\"Antiken Welt\\") * Bertelsmanns Museums-F√ºhrer, G√ºtersloh / M√ºnchen 1992 * Brigitte Knittlmayer and Wolf-Dieter Heilmeyer (eds.): Die Antikensammlung.

It is named after the Scottish naturalist Archibald Menzies. It is also known as the male tree fern, and Cibotium glaucum is deemed the female tree fern due to differences in color. Biology HƒÅpuu ii can grow up to tall but are usually in height with a diameter of nearly , making it Hawaii's largest tree fern. The trunk is made of stiff hard fibres surrounding a starchy pith in the centre. The green fronds have yellow midribs and are paler on the underside. They grow to as long as . Stems are covered in red or black bristles. The fronds are singularly divided but divide at the end where the spores form. =Reproduction= This species reproduces through the use of spores, which form at and are released from the end of the fronds. For domestic and commercial reproduction, spores are collected from the lower fronds of the plant, which are heated, treated with water and kept refrigerated. The side shoots off the main trunk are also viable but need to be cut close to the trunk. =Habitat= Cibotium menziesii is endemic to the windward portions of the main Hawaiian islands. It is found in rainforests at elevations of . They can grown on the ground or on trees as an epiphyte. Despite its origin, it is very adaptable and can withstand long cool winters; even without fronds, little heat is needed to stimulate new growth. Due to the effects of invasive species, especially feral pigs, and commercial harvesting, populations of this species are currently in decline. Uses =Food= The starchy core of the trunk can be cooked (often stewed) and eaten; it was a staple food during times of famine. This part of the trunk is an important food source for feral pigs. =Medicine= The pith of the hƒÅpuu ii is combined with olena (Curcuma longa) roots, pawale (Rumex giganteus), and okolehao liquor to create a 'blood purifier'. A treatment for chest pain is prepared from hƒÅpuu ii and amaumau (Sadleria cyatheoides) piths, kukui (Aleurites moluccana) bark, ohia ai (Syzygium malaccense) bark, ahakea (Bobea spp.) bark, uhaloa (Waltheria indica) root bark, popolo (Solanum americanum), aukoi (Senna occidentalis), noni (Morinda citrifolia) fruit, and ko kea (Saccharum officinarum). Heated fibres from the fronds are used to cure numerous bodily ailments such as muscle pain and joint stiffness. =Other uses= The pulu (frond fibres) are used to absorb bodily fluid from corpses in preparation for traditional burials. These same fibres are also used in handcrafted pillows that are sold as souvenirs on the islands. The trunk was hollowed out by Native Hawaiians and used as a planter for uhi (Dioscorea alata), and this practice continues.

Other companies obtained authorisation in the same year, and together they formed a route from central Scotland to Aberdeen. The SMJR opened its main line on 4 August 1848. Proposals to merge with other railways were rejected by Parliament at first, but in 1856 the SMJR merged with the Aberdeen Railway to form the Scottish North Eastern Railway. The SNER was itself absorbed into the larger Caledonian Railway in 1866. The original SMJR main line was now a small section of a main line from Carlisle and central Scotland to Aberdeen. The original route was well aligned for fast running, but it by-passed numerous towns and many branches were built to serve them. The rival North British Railway had its own route from the south to Aberdeen, and spectacular competition for the fastest journey from London to Aberdeen was generated in the final decades of the nineteenth century. In the 1960s there were some reflections of those days when powerful steam engines, displaced by diesel locomotives from other routes, operated a fast Glasgow - Aberdeen passenger service for some years. In the mid 1960s the move to rationalise duplicate routes led to closure of the SMJR main line in 1967 except for a residual goods service to intermediate locations. Now the entire SMJR network has closed, except for the section from Perth to Stanley Junction, serving the main line to Inverness. History =The Caledonian Railway= From the second decade of the nineteenth century, a number of short railway lines had been operating in Scotland; in most cases these were connected with mineral extraction, and there was little thought to connecting between them to form a network. The Stockton and Darlington Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in England showed that longer railway routes could be worthwhile, and thoughts turned to trunk railways in Scotland, and to connection to the emerging English network. In the 1840s business people in Scotland made definite moves which resulted in proposals for trunk lines to connect the central belt of Scotland with England, and in 1845 there was a frenzy of Parliamentary Bills for Scottish railways. The Caledonian Railway was authorised on 12 April 1845 with capital of ¬£1,500,000. Its main line was to run between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Carlisle. The Caledonian policy was to capture as much territory in Scotland as possible: they foresaw a \\"Caledonian system\\" controlled by themselves. At this period it was expected that a district could only support one railway line, so that the first to serve an area would secure a near-monopoly. Even before authorisation the Caledonian made provisional agreements with the promoters of other lines to lease their railways. This was done by agreeing a guaranteed periodical lease payment; it did not require money at the time of making the agreement, but it incurred a financial obligation later. =Authorisation= System map of the SMJR in 1855In the 1845 session of Parliament, a large number of Scottish trunk lines were proposed. In the period prior to the hearings, discussions about alliances and leases accelerated. The Scottish Central Railway was to build from Perth to Castlecary where it would join the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway and the Caledonian Railway, and it had discussed merging with the Scottish Midland Junction but at the same time it discussed leasing its line to the E&GR; or the Caledonian. The Scottish Midland Junction Railway was authorised on 31 July 1845, with capital of ¬£300,000, for a line just over 30 miles (48 km) in length from Perth to Forfar. At Perth it was to connect with the SCR and at Forfar with the Arbroath and Forfar Railway which gave rail access on to Aberdeen over the Aberdeen Railway. The Scottish Central Railway and the Caledonian Railway were also authorised on 31 July 1845. The Dundee and Newtyle Railway had been built in 1831 to connect the growing Burgh of Dundee with the fertile broad valley of Strathmore; it terminated at Newtyle which was then no more than a farm, intended as a railhead. This proved unpopular and two nominally independent extension railways were built, the Newtyle and Coupar Angus Railway and the Newtyle and Glammiss Railway. (Glammiss is spelt Glamis nowadays.) These railways opened in 1837, but they hardly added to the traffic of the Dundee line. Leaving Newtyle the two lines turned away from one another and together formed a nearly straight axis that suited the intended route of the SMJR; the authorising Act empowered the SMJR to acquire them and incorporate their lines into the SMJR main line. =A possible lease= After lengthy discussions, the SMJR agreed to lease its line to the Scottish Central Railway by decision of 18 February 1847; the lease charge was to be 6% on the SMJR capital of ¬£600,000.From Ross, page 39; the capital quoted is at considerable variance from Carter. On page 45 Ross quotes the SMJR capital as ¬£500,000. The Caledonian had assumed that it was going to lease the Scottish Central Railway, but this was not confirmed. The SCR lease of the SMJR seems not to have proceeded, for in 1848 the Caledonian was negotiating to lease the SMJR direct, and on 5 May 1848 agreement was finalised; the Caledonian would pay 6% on the SMJR capital, now quoted as ¬£500,000.Ross, page 46 The lease arrangement was modified to be joint with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway on an agreed traffic sharing system; but it needed to be ratified by Parliament.Ross, page 47 =Opening= The two Newtyle lines had been constructed to the track gauge of as a single line using stone block sleepers. This had to be converted to a more robust track construction as a double line; they were closed in 1847 for the purpose. The SMJR main line, including the converted sections, was opened on 20 August 1848. Through trains started to run from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Forfar over the line and the SCR. However, in 1849 it was reported that \\"many of the stations were unfinished and there was virtually no goods traffic\\". =The lease rejected by Parliament= The Caledonian Railway relations with the Edinburgh and Glasgow were somewhat stormy, and lurched from friendly to hostile. The lease of the SMJR required Parliamentary authorisation, and a joint Bill was prepared for the 1849 session. However, in February 1849 it became clear that any alliance between the Caledonian and the E&GR; was impossible and the Caledonian declined to proceed with the Bill, and the lease. In 1854 the SCR was still independent, and was negotiating with the SMJR for an amalgamation of the two companies. At this time the attitude of Parliament was hostile to mergers of railways, and the proposal was rejected. From this time there was a \\"loose amalgamation\\" between the SCR, the SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway: they worked collaboratively but remained separate companies. This ended on 29 July 1856 when they formally amalgamated, to form the Scottish North Eastern Railway. =Branches= On 26 June 1846 the SMJR obtained authorisation to build three branches: to Dunkeld, to Kirriemuir and to Blairgowrie. In fact only the Blairgowrie branch was constructed during the lifetime of the SMJR. The Dunkeld branch was actually built by an independent company, the Perth and Dunkeld Railway. It left the SMJR main line at Stanley Junction, and was opened on 7 April 1856. It was worked by the SMJR. The Perth and Dunkeld Railway was taken over in 1864 as part of a scheme to connect Perth and Inverness, by what became the Highland Railway. The Kirriemuir branch was opened in November 1854.According to Bradshaw; Quick says December 1854; Ferguson says (on page 80) that in November 1854 the SMJR informed Captain Tyler that improvements he had required during a previous inspection had been carried out, and Tyler advised the Board of Trade that the line could open without a re-inspection; Awdry says November 1855 (on page 102); Cobb says 1855; Thomas and Turnock say 12 August 1861 (page 314); Butt says 12 August 1861 (for passengers); Stansfield says August 1861; Ferguson is silent on the matter. Most trains continued to Forfar, and when the Dundee and Forfar direct line opened, to Dundee. The Blairgowrie branch left the main line at Coupar Angus; it opened for passengers on 1 August 1855, and for goods on 21 August 1855. Blairgowrie was an industrial centre for jute manufacture, and for soft fruit. The line descended sharply from Coupar Angus to the crossing of the River Isla, and then climbed again to the terminus. The Isla bridge was at first a twelve-span timber viaduct. On 3 February 1881 the river was in spate with large blocks of ice striking the piers of the bridge. The structure survived, but it was replaced by a stone and wrought iron bridge soon afterwards. In later years there were typically five passenger trains daily. The SMJR had inherited the short branch to Newtyle by its acquisition of the Coupar Angus and Glammiss lines. Other branches were constructed off the SMJR main line after the company was amalgamated. Absorption On 29 July 1856 the Scottish North Eastern Railway was formed by the amalgamation of the SMJR, the Scottish Central Railway and the Aberdeen Railway, forming a continuous line between Perth and Aberdeen. The SNER itself was absorbed by the Caledonian Railway by Act of Parliament on 10 August 1866. Subsequent history Firmly aligned to the Caledonian Railway, the route formed an important artery feeding Aberdeen traffic to central Scotland and the south. While express passenger trains caught the public eye, there was a substantial goods traffic; cattle were particularly dominant. Large structures on the line were constructed in laminated timber, but in the 1880s these were in poor condition and inadequate for the heavier and faster traffic of those days, and widespread reconstruction in stone and wrought iron was undertaken. As part of a route between London and Aberdeen, the line was rivalled by the North British Railway route on the east coast via Dundee. As publicity became important, the two routes competed for the title of the fastest transit, and in 1888 and again in 1895 spectacularly fast journeys were made; the rivalry was known as the Railway race to the north. Model of Caledonian Railway Class \\"769\\" or \\"Dunalastair II\\". At the Museum of Transport, Glasgow, 03/07. The early passenger engines used on the line were 2-4-0s. At the end of the 19th century and, after the line had been upgraded, the Caledonian Railway introduced the very successful 4-4-0 Dunalastair class of locomotives. In the late 1950s the line became a speeding ground for the three-hour Glasgow-to- Aberdeen expresses using Gresley A4 Pacifics displaced by dieselisation of long distance main line expresses. The route carried the last regular steam hauled passenger trains timed at over 60 mph (97 km/h). The Blairgowrie branch closed to passengers on 10 January 1955, and completely on 6 December 1965. The section from Alyth West Junction to Newtyle, the west curve built by the Newtyle and Coupar angus Railway, was used by Blairgowrie passenger trains and when the Blairgowrie passenger service was discontinued, the curve closed too. The Kirriemuir branch closed to passengers on 4 August 1952 and completely in 1965. There were two routes from central Scotland to Aberdeen, and during the process of rationalisation of the railways in the 1960s, the Dundee route was selected. Closure of the SMJR main line was inevitable and took place for passengers on 4 September 1967. The line was retained from Stanley Junction to Forfar for goods trains until 1982, with a 5 mph speed restriction. The Perth to Inverness line used the SMJR route as far as Stanley Junction, north of Perth. That line remains in use and the section from Perth to Stanley Junction is the only part of the SMJR that is still open to traffic. Topography The line ran from Perth to Forfar, with branches to Kirriemuir, Newtyle and Blairgowrie.

Charles Pictet de Rochemont (21 September 1755 ‚Äì 28 December 1824) was a statesman and diplomat who prepared the declaration of Switzerland's permanent neutrality ratified by the great powers in 1815. Early life Charles Pictet was born on 21 September 1755 at Cartigny near Geneva into an aristocratic but tolerant family. He is the son of a colonel, Charles Pictet (1713‚Äì1792) and of Marie, born Dunant. Since his young age, he wanted to dedicate himself to a military career. At the age of 20 he went to France and for twelve years pursued a career in the French Army. After his marriage in 1786 to Ad√©la√Øde Sara de Rochemont he modified his name to the more aristocratic \\"Pictet de Rochemont\\". Two years later he entered the governing council of Geneva and was made responsible for reorganizing the urban militia. In 1792 the former city councils of Geneva were suspended and a provisional government took over, declaring all citizens equal. In 1794 Pictet was placed under house arrest for a year. His father-in-law, Jean-Fran√ßois de Rochemont, was less lucky; he was executed. Napoleonic Wars Later, Switzerland became a theatre of war. Napoleon had invaded in 1798 and everywhere egalitarian ideas took root and the old aristocracy was swept away. Armies devastated the countryside and the winter of 1800 would long be remembered as one of misery and starvation. Geneva was annexed to France. A few weeks later Napoleon issued a new constitution for a Helvetic Republic trying to replace the former archaic system of cantonal authorities with a centralized executive. This caused such a violent reaction that Napoleon withdrew his troops in 1802. The power vacuum thus created set off a civil war, during which Napoleon offered his services as arbitrator. He urged the Swiss to come up with a constitution themselves. The new constitution restored the notion of autonomous cantons, created six new cantons and gave a new name to the country - the Swiss Confederation. Meanwhile, in 1798, Pictet de Rochemont had acquired seventy-five hectares of land at Lancy, centred on the present mairie de Lancy, and led the life of a gentleman farmer. He concentrated on the breeding of merino sheep and introduced the culture of maize to the Geneva region. His agrarian innovations spread. Alongside his life as a farmer, he wrote a great deal and founded a review entitled La biblioth√®que britannique. From 1796 to 1815 he wrote the agricultural column in it. Napoleon‚Äôs downfall led to the liberation of Geneva by Austrian troops. A new republican government was declared on 1 January 1814 and Pictet read the public proclamation, probably written by himself. Napoleon‚Äôs brief return to power in 1815 - the Hundred Days - ending at the Battle of Waterloo does not seem to have had any effect on the events that followed. Diplomat Statue of Pictet in Geneva Two apparently contradictory objectives of the new government, much favoured by Pictet, were to restore Genevan independence but also to make Geneva part of the Swiss Confederation. To achieve this it was necessary to: (a) to make Genevan territory homogenous (it consisted of several fragmented communes); and (b) to connect it physically to the canton of Vaud and thus to Switzerland as a whole (Versoix was in France). Pictet participated in the first deputation sent in 1814 to request that the Great Powers support Geneva‚Äôs position. He then represented Geneva and Switzerland in several rounds of meetings held in Paris (Treaty of Paris) and Vienna (Congress of Vienna) during 1814 and 1815. While the victors were mainly interested in sharing the spoils of war, Pictet de Rochement‚Äôs political talent and diplomatic skills were aimed precisely at recovering Geneva‚Äôs independence and joining it to the twenty-one cantons then forming the Swiss Confederation, Valais and Neuch√¢tel having just entered as full and equal cantons. The first confrontation in Paris was not a success since the French negotiator, Talleyrand, refused to let go of any part of the Pays de Gex. Later, in October 1814 there was the Congress of Vienna. Pictet participated actively in the relevant conclaves and negotiations, not waiting for suitable outcomes to come his way. The idea that Geneva should form part of the Swiss Confederation became a reality on 19 May 1815. However, Geneva had not yet been able to consolidate its fragmented territory. But now, following the change in Geneva‚Äôs status, Pictet could count on the backing of the Swiss Government and was given full powers to negotiate. He soon achieved the territorial success he sought. North of the lake, six communes were transferred from the pays de Gex, thus giving Geneva its connection with the canton of Vaud. As had already been decided in Vienna and Paris, by the Treaty of Turin in 1816 on the left bank another twenty-three communes were transferred from Savoy and became part of the canton. King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia had himself only just recently recovered this territory. This extension of the cantonal land became known as the \\"communes r√©unies\\", hence the road of this name in Grand-Lancy. It was also stated that the non-Swiss customs posts were to be situated at least one league (approximately five kilometres) from the new Swiss frontier, thus creating the \\"zone franche\\" on both sides of the canton. Into the bargain, the Great Powers meeting in Paris recognized the \\"permanent neutrality of Switzerland\\" and agreed that Swiss neutrality was, indeed, in the common interest of all European countries. Pictet himself wrote the text of the declaration of neutrality. Later life and posterity In the summer of 1816 Pictet de Rochemont returned to his sheep and his maize fields having perfectly succeeded in his mission. The Swiss parliament or Diet (Tagsatzung), as it was at that time, expressed its recognition of his services. He died on 28 December 1824 at Lancy. A statue of Charles Pictet de Rochemont has been erected Rampe de la Treille at the entrance of the Old Town in 1970.

It is home to several ancient Roman remains, traditionally identified with the villa of the Gordian imperial family, which included three Roman emperors of the 3rd century, Gordian I, Gordian II and Gordian III. History The complex, which is mentioned in ancient sources such as the Historia Augusta, had a portico with some 200 columns, in different stones. It also included basilicas and baths. During the 13th century, the Tor de' Schiavi (literally \\"Tower of the Slaves\\", although the name derives from the dello Schiavo family, who acquired it in 1571) was built over the remains. In 1422 the area was acquired by the Colonna family. The monumental entrance of the villa is an octagonal structure dating perhaps to the late 3rd-early 4th century, when the villa was enlarged and restored. The complex and the garden were restored in the 1960s, and has now the status of an archaeological park. It is divided in two sectors by the Via Prenestina.

The technology was only used in Intel chipsets released in 2003, and was largely seen as a stop-gap measure to allow Gigabit Ethernet chips to run at full-speed until the arrival of a faster expansion bus (it was also used to connect the Wireless networking chips in Intel's Centrino mobile platform). To Intel's credit though, CSA-connected Ethernet chips did show consistently higher transfer rates than comparable PCI cards.

The game was published in 1990 for the PC Engine under the title Drop Rock Hora Hora, and subsequently saw a stateside release for the TurboGrafx-16 console as Drop Off. Gameplay The game is a Breakout clone, where the player moves a paddle back and forth in order to destroy objects. Each stage has a set of the same object (for example, apples on the first stage). Unlike Breakout and other comparable games, the player in Drop Off does not automatically lose a life if the paddle touches the floor and the player is never required to hit the objects in order to clear the stage. Instead, the player must avoid the series of objects that are scrolling vertically downward to move on to next stage, and the gameplay is practically identical to Cluster Buster, an earlier title on the DECO Cassette System. The player has the option of switching the direction of their paddle from vertical to horizontal during the game and is free to move the paddle anywhere on the screen. Drop Off contains 16 stages divided in 5 rounds. Legacy Drop Off was re-released on Nintendo's Virtual Console in North America on July 30, 2007 and in Japan on August 28, 2007.

In 1986, as one half of duo Morgan-McVey, they released the single \\"Looking Good Diving\\", whose B-side \\"Looking Good Diving with the Wild Bunch\\" would later be reworked into Neneh Cherry's 1988 single \\"Buffalo Stance\\". =Virgin Souls= In 2003, McVey along with Paul Simm, Silvio Pacini and Neil Pearson released the self- produced album 162, under the name of Virgin Souls. =CirKus= In 2006, McVey (under the name Burt Ford) along with Neneh Cherry, Matt Kent (aka Karmil) and Lolita Moon released the album Laylow, as a band called CirKus. In 2008, CirKus (with the same line-up) released their second album Medicine. Personal life In 1983, McVey fathered a son, Marlon Roudette, with Vincentian artist and designer Vonnie Roudette. McVey met Neneh Cherry in 1987 at Heathrow Airport while they were en route to Japan as fashion models as part of London Designer Ray Petri's Buffalo Posse. The couple wed in 1990; they have two daughters, one of whom is the singer Mabel. The family lived throughout Europe. In 1993, they moved near M√°laga, Spain and lived there until 1999. Briefly in 1995, they lived in Brooklyn, New York, where they had purchased a home in the Park Slope neighbourhood. Soon after moving in, the couple were held up at gunpoint and robbed by a teenage bandit. They headed back to London's Primrose Hill. Eventually they migrated to Cherry's native H√§ssleholm, Sweden, living in the same schoolhouse-turned-home where Cherry was raised (featured in the Homebrew album's artwork).

High school career Willis attended Saint Bernard High School in Playa Del Rey, California. As a sophomore, Willis started at safety, earning Rookie of the Year honors. His junior year, Willis ranked 2nd in the league in rushing, and 2nd in total individual tackles. As a senior, he was the Defensive Player of the Year, member of the \\"All Regional Team\\" as a running back, and SuperPrep All-American candidate. He also was a 3x Del Rey League, 1st team selection. Willis ran track, including top honors in the 200 m, 400 m, 4 √ó 100 m relay, and 4 √ó 400 m relay. College career Willis played collegiately at the University of Oregon. He started his junior and senior year, playing in 47 games, totaling 93 catches for 1,117 yards with three touchdowns. As a red-shirt freshman, Willis contributed heavily on special teams, but still served as a viable back up receiver. As a sophomore, Willis solidified himself as the 3rd receiver behind starters Marshaun Tucker and Keenan Howry. Averaging 4 catches a game, Willis ended his sophomore campaign, scoring his first touchdown in the 2000 Culligan Holiday Bowl in San, Diego, California. That touchdown resulted in the game winning score. Willis enjoyed a stellar junior year. Earning the starting spot, with teammates Keenan Howry and Sammie Parker, the three were considered one of the most \\"lethal\\" receiving core tandems in college football. His junior year ended with the controversial BCS decision to pick Nebraska over Oregon, for the National Championship match up. Nebraska went on to lose to Miami. Oregon defeated the Big 12 Champion Colorado Buffaloes 38 - 16. Willis was known for his sure hands, blocking ability, and deceptive 4.3 speed. He also, served as a running back in special designed game plans. In 2002, Willis and teammates Keenan Howry, Sammie Parker, were displayed on a 10-story billboard in downtown Los Angeles California. The billboard was used as a vital recruiting tool in Los Angeles. The billboard sat adjacent to the Staple Center. All three receivers attended Los Angeles based high schools. Willis also ran track for the University of Oregon with a personal best of 21.15 (200 m). He was the lead-off leg for the 4 √ó 100 m relay team. Professional career Willis signed with the Seattle Seahawks active roster as an undrafted free agent his rookie year 2003 but was placed on injured reserve after breaking his thumb in the opening game of that year. He was allocated to NFL Europe to play with the Frankfurt Galaxy, where he led the team in receptions and yards and paced first place in the league with an average of 30 yards per kickoff return. Willis also led his team to the 2004 World Bowl Championship, where they were defeated by the Berlin Thunder. During his second season with the Seahawks 2004, Willis played alongside hall of famer Jerry Rice. Willis was released during his third year with Seattle and was signed by the Miami Dolphins, where he played with current NFL receivers Wes Welker and Marty Booker. Willis also rejoined college teammate Joey Harrington in Miami. After a two-year stint with the Dolphins, Willis was signed with the Washington Redskins. Willis played his first arena season in 2008 for the New York Dragons where he set the single-season reception record of (140). He also played alongside Aaron Garcia, who is arguably the best quarterback to play arena football. Willis continued his arena career in 2010 with the Jacksonville Sharks where he helped lead the team to its first playoff berth in their inaugural year. Willis was later signed by the Pittsburgh Power the following year where he led the team in yards and receptions. In 2012, Willis assigned to the San Antonio Talons and led the team in receptions, helping the team win 12 consecutive games and a first-round playoff berth in its inaugural season. Willis was later assigned to the San Jose SaberCats in November 2012. His 2013 campaign with the San Jose SaberCats was a record setting year as Willis topped the single season yardage record of 1,560 set by teammate and hall of famer James Roe back in 2007. His own personal best of 1,606 yards and 35 touchdowns in both categories helped the SaberCats reach the playoffs before losing to the would-be ArenaBowl Champion Arizona Rattlers. Willis returned to San Jose in 2014 and climbed one step closer to achieving a championship career but fell one game short losing in the semi finals once again to the Arizona Rattlers who would go on to win the ArenaBowl. His sixth consecutive season of 1,000 yards and 20 plus touchdowns were just one of the many consistent traits Willis possessed that made him an elite wide receiver in that league. On April 30, 2015, Willis was assigned to the Las Vegas Outlaws.

The name of _rainbow_ comes from Rubinstein (1991), who emphasises that this option was based on a combination of various assets like a rainbow is a combination of various colors. More generally, rainbow options are multiasset options, also referred to as correlation options, or basket options. Rainbow can take various other forms but the combining idea is to have a payoff that is depending on the assets sorted by their performance at maturity. When the rainbow only pays the best (respectively worst) performing asset of the basket, it is also called _best- of_ , (respectively _worst-of_ ). Other popular options that can be reformulated as a rainbow option are spread and exchange options. Overview Rainbow options are usually calls or puts on the best or worst of n underlying assets. Like basket option, which is written on a group of assets and pays out on a weighted-average gain on the basket as a whole, a rainbow option also considers a group of assets, but usually pays out on the level of one of them. Choudhry, Moorad. Bond and money markets: strategy, trading, analysis. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2003. p.838 A simple example is a call rainbow option written on FTSE 100, Nikkei and S&P; 500 which will pay out the difference between the strike price and the level of the index that has risen by the largest amount of the three. Another example is an option that includes more than one strike on more than one underlying asset with a payoff equivalent to largest in-the-money portion of any of the strike prices. Taleb, Nassim. Dynamic hedging: managing vanilla and exotic options. Vol. 64. John Wiley & Sons, 1997. p.384 Alternatively, in a more complex scenario, the assets are sorted by their performance at maturity, for instance, a rainbow call with weights 50%, 30%, 20%, with a basket including FTSE 100, Nikkei and S&P; 500 pays 50% of the best return (at maturity) between the three indices, 30% of the second best and 20% of the third best. The options are often considered a correlation trade since the value of the option is sensitive to the correlation between the various basket components. Rainbow options are used, for example, to value natural resources deposits. Such assets are exposed to two uncertainties‚Äîprice and quantity. Some simple options can be transformed into more complex instruments if the underlying risk model that the option reflected does not match a future reality. In particular, derivatives in the currency and mortgage markets have been subject to liquidity risk that was not reflected in the pricing of the option when sold. Payoff Rainbow options refer to all options whose payoff depends on more than one underlying risky asset; each asset is referred to as a color of the rainbow.Benhamou, Eric. Rainbow options Examples of these include: Ouwehand, Peter, and Graeme West. \\"Pricing rainbow options.\\" Wilmott magazine 5 (2006): 74-80. * _Best of assets or cash_ option, delivering the maximum of two risky assets and cash at expiryStulz, Ren√©M. \\"Options on the minimum or the maximum of two risky assets: analysis and applications.\\" Journal of Financial Economics 10.2 (1982): 161-185.Johnson, Herb. \\"Options on the maximum or the minimum of several assets.\\" Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 22.3 (1987): 277-283.Rubinstein, Mark. \\"Somewhere over the rainbow.\\" Risk 4.11 (1991): 61-63. * _Call on max_ option, giving the holder the right to purchase the maximum asset at the strike price at expiry * _Call on min_ option, giving the holder the right to purchase the minimum asset at the strike price at expiry * _Put on max_ option, giving the holder the right to sell the maximum of the risky assets at the strike price at expiry Margrabe, William. \\"The value of an option to exchange one asset for another.\\" The journal of finance 33.1 (1978): 177-186 * _Put on min_ option, giving the holder the right to sell the minimum of the risky assets at the strike at expiry * _Put 2 and call 1_ , an exchange option to put a predefined risky asset and call the other risky asset. Thus, asset 1 is called with the 'strike' being asset 2. Thus, the payoffs at expiry for rainbow European options are: * Best of assets or cash: \\\\max(S_1, S_2, . . . , S_n, K) * Call on max: \\\\max(\\\\max(S_1, S_2, . . . ,S_n)-K,0) * Call on min: \\\\max(\\\\min(S_1, S_2, . . . ,S_n)-K,0) * Put on max: \\\\max(K-\\\\max(S_1, S_2, . . . ,S_n),0) * Put on min: \\\\max(K-\\\\min(S_1, S_2, . . . , S_n),0) * Put 2 and Call 1: \\\\max(S_1 - S_2, 0) Pricing and valuation Rainbow options are usually priced using an appropriate industry-standard model (such as Black‚ÄìScholes) for each individual basket component, and a matrix of correlation coefficients applied to the underlying stochastic drivers for the various models.

It is located in the southeast of the Free State of Saxony near the border with the Czech Republic. It consists of the two districts Oberoderwitz and Niederoderwitz, in the historic tripartite division of the place also Mitteloderwitz is known.  Culture and sightseeing  = Buildings = The Neumann Mill in 1971. Refer Commons for other images of the mill Oderwitz was once known for its many mills and even today it is known as the Windmill Village. Today, three windmills have been preserved, the Birkm√ºhle, the Neumann-Mill and the Berndt-Mill. Two old watermills have also survived, the Bernhardt Mill and Lower Mill. As in other parts of Lusatia, there are many half-timbered houses ‚àí over 450 in the village. The studio of the homeland painter Max Langer can be found in Niederoderwitz. Due to the historic division and the size of the village, Oderwitz has two churches. Construction of the Niederoderwitz church began in 1719, and it was consecrated in 1726. It was built in Baroque style and has a richly decorated altar. The Oberoderwitz church was built from 1816 to 1821 in the architectural style of classicism. = Memorials = Towards the end of World War II since January 1945 in what is now the district Niederoderwitz one outpost of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp existed, which mainly Jewish inmates were used for forced labor. Five of them were murdered in the spring of 1945 by SS men. A memorial recalls them in the cemetery. Another memorial in the cemetery commemorates Oderwitz citizens who have fallen in the Franco- German war. Oderwitz in the course of its history has been repeatedly ravaged by floods, which killed several people. For the flood victims of 1880 a memorial stone was built in Niederoderwitz near the river Landwasser. Furthermore,a small memorial located on the surface of the primary school Max Langer evocatives of the siblings Scholl. In the cemetery of the suburb Oberoderwitz a grave recalls the Polish forced laborer Michalina Woysiak who was shot in May 1945. A commemorative plaque for the opponent of Hitler, Willi Netsch, at the house Dorfstra√üe 189 was removed after 1990. = Natural monuments = In the municipal area of Oderwitz there are many natural monuments of volcanic origin. The biggest is probably the mountain Oberoderwitzer Spitzberg with his head of Phonolite. On the slopes of the mountain Sonnenh√ºbel, there are the so-called Steinklunsen, rock formations on which a dense beech forest has grown. Moreover, one can find several abandoned phonolite quarries, which have been reclaimed by nature, piece by piece, such as the Geiersberg or Steinberg near Spitzkunnersdorf.

From 2013‚Äì2015, the line was temporarily discontinued on some Dell websites but continued to be offered in other markets, such as Malaysia And India. Prior to Vostro, Dell's home and small business computers were sold under the same lines: Dimension for home and small business desktops, and Inspiron for home and small business portables. With the introduction of Vostro, the Dimension line was discontinued, and the Inspiron line changed to include all computers for the home market; regardless of form factor. One marked difference between the Inspiron line and the Vostro line is that the Vostro line is cheaper but comes with shorter technical availability.  Temporary discontinuation  In July 2013, Dell announced that they would stop manufacturing all Dell Vostro systems. Select models were made available on various Dell outlet channels for a limited time. The discontinuation of Vostro models was reportedly because of changing technology and lesser demand in the corporate world. Subsequently, the Vostro was resurrected onto the market in early 2015.  Current laptops line  The current lineup of Vostro laptops includes Vostro 3000 series that was released on March 9, 2010, Vostro 14 5000 series that was released on October 13, 2015 and Vostro 15 5000 series released on January 20, 2017.

Following the defeat of the Protestant armies by the Habsburgs in the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620, many Protestant Czechs found refuge across the border in the hills of Upper Lusatia. It is a \\"Kurort\\", a resort or spa certified by the state, where people go for rest and recuperation. It is most famous for its mountain of the same name, an exposed natural sandstone dome that towers above the town. The ruins of a medieval monastery lend a wild romantic beauty to it and it was a favorite subject of 19th-century Romantic painters like Caspar David Friedrich. Many bizarrely shaped geological rock formations can be found in the surroundings. The scenic narrow gauge Zittau‚ÄìKurort Oybin/Kurort Jonsdorf railway runs from Oybin to Bertsdorf, from there to the neighboring municipality of Jonsdorf and the town of Zittau.

Such processes are contrasted with hot working techniques like hot rolling, forging, welding, etc. Cold forming techniques are usually classified into four major groups: squeezing, bending, drawing, and shearing. They generally have the advantage of being simpler to carry out than hot working techniques. Unlike hot working, cold working causes the crystal grains and inclusions to distort following the flow of the metal; which may cause work hardening and anisotropic material properties. Work hardening makes the metal harder, stiffer, and stronger, but less plastic, and may cause cracks of the piece. The possible uses of cold forming are extremely varied, including large flat sheets, complex folded shapes, metal tubes, screw heads and threads, riveted joints, and much more. Processes The following is a list of cold forming processes: *Squeezing: Rolling Swaging Extrusion Forging Sizing Riveting Staking Coining Peening Burnishing Heading Hubbing Thread rolling *Bending: Angle bending Roll bending Draw and compression Roll forming Seaming Flanging Straightening *Shearing Sheet metal shear-cutting Slitting Blanking Piercing Lancing Perforating Notching Nibbling Shaving Trimming Cutoff Dinking *Drawing Wire drawing Tube drawing Metal spinning Embossing Stretch forming Sheet metal drawing Ironing Superplastic forming  Advantages  Advantages of cold working over hot working include: *No heating required *Better surface finish *Superior dimensional control *Better reproducibility and interchangeability *Directional properties can be imparted into the metal *Contamination problems are minimized Depending on the material and extent of deformation, the increase in strength due to work hardening may be comparable to that of heat treating. Therefore, it is sometimes more economical to cold work a less costly and weaker metal than to hot work a more expensive metal that can be heat treated, especially if precision or a fine surface finish is required as well. The cold working process also reduces waste as compared to machining, or even eliminates with near net shape methods. The material savings becomes even more significant at larger volumes, and even more so when using expensive materials, such as copper, nickel, gold, tantalum, and palladium. The saving on raw material as a result of cold forming can be very significant, as is saving machining time. Production cycle times when cold working are very short. On multi-station machinery, production cycle times are even less. This can be very advantageous for large production runs. Disadvantages Some disadvantages and problems of cold working are: *The metal is harder, calling for greater forces, harder tools and dies, and heavier equipment *The metal is less ductile and malleable, limiting the amount of deformation that can be obtained *Metal surfaces must be clean and scale-free *May leave undesirable anisotropy in the final piece *May leave undesirable residual stress in the final piece The need for heavier and equipment and harder tools may make cold working suitable only for large volume manufacturing industry. The loss of plasticity due to work hardening may require intermediate annealings, and a final annealing to relieve residual stress and give the desired properties to the manufactured object. These extra steps would negate some of the economic advantages of cold forming over hot forming. Cold worked items suffer from a phenomenon known as springback, or elastic springback. After the deforming force is removed from the workpiece, the workpiece springs back slightly. The amount a material springs back is equal to the yield strain (the strain at the yield point) for the material. Special precautions may be needed to maintain the general shape of the workpiece during cold working, such as shot peening and equal channel angular extrusion. =References= .

Biography  Other members included Dag Stiberg on tenor saxophone, Behzad Farazollahi on drums, Anders M√∏ller on percussion and Raymond Jensen on bass. Keyboardist Mikael Lindqvist also appeared on their first album, My Midnight Creeps. The band's music carried inspiration from The Stooges, as well as The Rolling Stones and The Animals. Their critically acclaimed second album Histamin received six out of six points in a review in Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang. Following the death of Bur√•s on July 12, 2007, My Midnight Creeps was quickly dissolved, however, in 2011 the remaining members of the band (with the exception of bassist Jensen, who was replaced by ex-Madrugada bassist Frode Jacobsen) started a new project named Kitchie Kitchie Ki Me O.

At the age of twenty-seven, after a period of military service in the Imperial Russian Army, he left his native Russia and came to the monastic state of Mt. Athos (an autonomous peninsula in Greece) where he became a monk at the Monastery of St Panteleimon, known as \\"Rossikon\\", an Orthodox monastery that houses Russian monks yet is, as all the Athonite monasteries, under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople. There, was given the name Silouan (the Russian version of the Biblical name Silvanus.) An ardent ascetic, he received the grace of unceasing prayer and saw Christ in a vision. After long years of spiritual trial, he acquired great humility and inner stillness. He prayed and wept for the whole world as for himself, and he put the highest value on love for enemies. He became widely known as an elder. St Silouan died on September 24, 1938. His memory is celebrated on September 24. Though barely literate, he was sought out by pilgrims for his wise counsel. His writings were edited by his disciple and pupil, Archimandrite Sophrony. Father Sophrony has written the life of the saint along with a record of St. Silouan's teachings in the book Saint Silouan the Athonite. Starets Silouan was canonized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 1987. Quotations * Those who dislike and reject their fellow-man are impoverished in their being. They do not know the true God, who is all-embracing love. * Keep your mind in hell and do not despair, said to be a teaching God gave him through a voice from above. * The soul that is in all things devoted to the will of God rests quiet in Him, for she knows of experience and from the Holy Scriptures that the Lord loves us much and watches over our souls, quickening all things by His grace in peace and love. Nothing troubles the man who is given over to the will of God, be it illness, poverty or persecution. He knows that the Lord in His mercy is solicitous for us. The Holy Spirit, whom the soul knows, is witness therefore. But the proud and the self-willed do not want to surrender to God's will because they like their own way, and that is harmful for the soul. (From the Life and Teachings of Elder Siluan by Bishop Alexander and Natalia Bufius translated by Anatoly Shmelev) * The condition of peace among men is that each should keep a consciousness of his own wrongdoing * Understand two thoughts, and fear them. One says, \\"You are a saint,\\" and the other, \\"You won't be saved.\\" Both of these thoughts are from the enemy, and there is no truth in them. But think this way: I am a great sinner, but the Lord is merciful. He loves people very much, and He will forgive my sins.

It is the oldest public housing development in Connecticut, occupied since 1941. It was designed by Frank Bissell, an architect who had moved to Norwalk after having worked in the New York offices of Barber and Bissell. Due to flood damage from Hurricane Sandy and increased demand for housing in the South Norwalk area, a major three-part reconstruction plan for Washington Village broke ground in 2016. The plan has involved phasing in the site's original 136 public housing units, as well as an additional 137 mixed use and market rate units. The project is scheduled to complete in 2021. The South Norwalk area, locally referred to as SoNo, is seeing an increase in population in recent years, contrary to the state-wide population loss. In addition to it being one of the only walkable downtown neighborhoodsNorwalk Housing Authority, Norwalk Redevelopment Agency. \\"Washington Village / South Norwalk Transformation Plan\\" .

Nearby projects which have the same goal of improving access to housing include 19 Day Street, which features 20 affordable units in a new modular structure. Increased densification of the area may offer additional opportunities to increase the availability of urban open space on the nearby waterfront. The project is led by New England-based Harriman Group. The developer, Trinity Washington Village Limited Partnership, has been working alongside the Norwalk Housing Authority to make a smooth transition for public housing renters. Also involved in the project is the quasi-governmental Norwalk Redevelopment Agency. Funding for the Washington Village reconstruction was fulfilled in part by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development‚Äôs $30 million Choice Neighborhoods grant. This increase in local affordable housing was part of a greater initiative by now-former Governor of Connecticut, Dan Malloy during his time in office, when 22,000 affordable units were created. The state likewise contributed towards this project's funding through the Bonding Commission and Connecticut's Housing Finance Authority's Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. As of August 13, 2019, the Norwalk Housing Authority approved minor changes to the final part of the project, which has been in accordance with the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency.

The pathogen, commonly referred to as ArMV, is from the family Secoviridae, and it causes yellow dwarf of raspberry and is one of the causes of mosaic of rhubarb. Arabis mosaic virus infects multiple hosts, including strawberries, hops, hemp, grape, geraniums, raspberries, sugar beets, celery, horseradish, lilac, peach, and lettuces.  Symptoms  While it is common for the hosts not to show any symptoms of the pathogens influence, there are some symptoms that can occur in the hosts. The most prevalent symptoms of the ArMV are stunting of the plant and leaf flecking/molting and leaf enations. The symptoms will vary based on the type of rootstock, environmental conditions and variety.  Disease cycle  This virus is transmitted mainly through the soil by nematodes, but it can also be transmitted by arthropods (such as insects), and through seed and pollen transmission. Nepoviruses are transmitted through three different genera of nematodes: Xiphinema Longidorus, and Paralongidorus. For Arabis mosaic virus, Xiphinema diversicaudatum is the most common nematode vector. In this cycle, females lay their eggs in the spring, which then hatch and the juveniles mature through four different stages (which can be distinguished by body length and functionality of odontostyles) and finally move into adulthood. Nematodes feed on the roots of the infected plants, taking up the virus with them as they do and allowing for the virus to travel between plants. The nematodes can only transmit the virus when they are adults, but once they molt they have to re-uptake the virus from an infected root in order for them to pass it on again.  Management  The best way to control the virus is to use virus-free planting material. The pathogen can only be transmitted through soils where the pathogen already exists and nematodes are present, so when proper hygienic techniques and sterile materials are used the crops will be virus free. It is also important to test the soil where plants had previously been infected to make sure there are no nematodes that are remaining in the soil. These measures are all that is being used so far because nematicides are not able to reduce the nematode presence, as the nematodes are able to reside deep within the soil in the roots of the plants.

Synopsis  ;Act I (1952-1972) Six- year-old Jen Tracy welcomes her newborn brother John into the world, with a warning about the way things work and a promise to protect him from Dad. (\\"Welcome to the World\\") As they grow, Jen does her best to shield John from life's disappointments, including a painful Christmas Eve fight between their parents. Not long after John's seventh birthday, Jen discovers a bruise on his face. \\"It was my fault,\\" he tells her, \\"I broke a glass.\\" Jen vows that Dad will never hurt John again, and she and John make a deal to always be there for each other. (\\"Think Big\\") As the pair grows older, sibling rivalry crops up when John is forced to attend Jen's high school basketball finals. (\\"Dear God\\") But when it's time for Jen to go off to college, John begs her not to leave him alone. (\\"Hold Down the Fort\\") Jen is determined to break free, however, deal or no deal. \\"I can't hold your hand forever,\\" she tells John. \\"Grow up\\". Jen embraces the world of the '60s in groovy New York City, where she blossoms into a drug-experimenting hippie while John's life goes in the opposite direction. (\\"Timeline\\") Without Jen there to protect him, John falls under his father's influence and decides to join the Navy. (\\"It Took Me A While\\") When Jen returns home from New York, she and John see how much they've changed and how far apart they've grown. (\\"Out of My Sight\\") Learning of Jen's plans to move to Canada with her draft-dodging boyfriend, John accuses her of rejecting everything he and Dad stand for, and they part in anger. (\\"Run and Hide\\") After John leaves, Jen unfurls an American flag, drapes it over a coffin, and we learn that John has been killed in Vietnam. \\"I'm sorry, little brother,\\" she whispers as Act I ends. (\\"Epilogue\\") ;Act II (1972-1990) Now living in Canada, 26-year-old Jen is the mother of a newborn baby boy, whom she names John. (\\"Old Clothes\\") But this John is not the na√Øve child of the '50s his mother expects him to be. When Jen moves back to the United States, leaving her failed marriage behind, she prepares to spend Christmas alone with seven-year-old John. Her gift to her son is an old baseball glove, which she proudly tells him belonged to his uncle. But John rejects the gift, complaining, \\"I'll be the only kid in school with a crappy old glove!\\" Jen gets her son to play his uncle's favourite sport, but her obnoxious behavior at games only succeeds in mortifying him. (\\"Little League\\") Visiting her brother's grave on what would have been his 32nd birthday, Jen remarks on the similarities between the two Johns and vows that she won't fail her son. (\\"Just Like You\\") But when it's time for the 12-year-old to go off to camp, Jen finds herself barely able to say goodbye. (\\"Bye Room\\") In a montage spanning John's high school years, John and Jen take turns as mock talk show hosts covering topics that reveal Jen's growing dependence on her son and John's struggle for freedom. (\\"Talk Show\\") Later, when John discovers that his mother has hidden his acceptance packet from Columbia University, it becomes clear that Jen is terrified that she'll lose John \\"again,\\" and she is no longer able to differentiate between her brother and her son. (\\"Smile of Your Dreams\\") Finally realizing how desperately his mother needs him, John decides to forgo Columbia in favour of a local community college. Disturbed to see him throwing away his future on her account, Jen ridicules his decision. John is deeply hurt by his mother's reaction, and he bitterly mocks her influence on his life. (\\"Graduation\\") As their argument escalates, Jen slaps her son. Shaken by the parallels to her abusive father, Jen retreats to her brother's grave, where she finally accepts that it's time to move on. (\\"The Road Ends Here\\") John joins his mother at the cemetery, where Jen asks his forgiveness. (\\"That Was My Way\\") Jen is finally able to let her son go, and they take their first steps into the world on their own.

He gained notability in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as an individual performer, a composer of ragtime songs, and as a member and later owner of various minstrel shows including the Smart Set Company. Dudley is also notable as one of the first African Americans to combine business with theater, by starting a black theater circuit, in which theaters were owned or operated by African Americans and provided entertainment by and for African Americans. Career Reportedly, Dudley was born in 1872 in Dallas, Texas (some sources list his year of birth as around 1870 or 1873), \\"of humble parentage\\".Abbot and Seroff 87. A jockey early in his youth, he turned to theater and gained a reputation by singing in a medicine show on a Dallas street corner, singing \\"Dese Bones G'wine Rise Again\\". By 1897 he had his own show, the \\"S. H. Dudley's Georgia Minstrels\\", who were performing in Galveston; later that same year he was on tour with P. T. Wright's Nashville Students Company. He gained a reputation for writing popular coon songs (including a hit song called \\"Mr. Coon, You'se Too Black For Me\\"), and performed with a number of minstrel comedians in shows in the same vein, including A Holiday in Coonville (his own production) and Coontown Golf Club (a production by Tom BrownHill and Hatch 141-42. and Sam CousinsBrooks 602.).Abbot and Seroff 88-89. When he toured with Tom Brown and Billy Kersands in 1902, it was clear that he was a popular, well-known artist in the South, and was billed as \\"the Lone-Star comedian\\". In 1903 he married Alberta Ormes, with whom he'd been performing since at least 1901, and was on tour the following year with Richard and Pringle's Georgia Minstrels. By this time, he received star billing. In the summer of 1904, however, he left that company and moved to Chicago to take over the leading role in Gus Hill's Smart SetBrooks 520. after the death of Tom McIntosh, performing in the show A Southern Enchantment.Abbot and Seroff 89. Dudley performed with the Smart Set for years with great success, though one critic, Sylvester Russell (a writer for the Indianapolis Freeman), was hard on him from the beginning, presumably because he felt that Dudley's minstrel show background made him unworthy; in 1906, Russell referred to him as \\"this loathsome comedian who hails from the Lone Star State.\\" It seems that Dudley took all this in stride until 1911, when Russell made a comment about Dudley's son, after which Dudley beat him up \\"$5,000 worth\\", according to Russell; Dudley was arrested and fined $1 and court costs, after which Russell sued him for $5,000. Other critics were less hesitant to praise Dudley's performance, and he is now credited with having brought \\"the street to the stage\\": \\"Dudley revitalized the Smart Set and made it into an enduring classic of the American popular stage.\\"Abbot and Seroff 90. In the next Smart Set show, The Black Politician (1906), Dudley got to use his jockey skills riding a horse on stage, and when in October 1906 a donkey named Shamus O'Brien was added (though another source lists the donkey's name as \\"Patrick\\"), the donkey and Dudley received high praise from critics, even from Russell.Abbot and Seroff 96-98. In 1909, the Smart Set split up in a Northern and a Southern Smart Set, the first being directed by Dudley and the latter by his understudy, Salem Tutt Whitney; their 1909-10 production, His Honor, the Barber was written by a white playwright, Edwin Handford, with music written for the show by black composers James Tim Brymn, Chris Smith, and James Burris. The show opened in New Jersey for a mixed audience, and by the time of the final run Aida Overton Walker had joined the cast.Abbot and Seroff 102-104. By this time, Dudley was widely known as the \\"Lone Star Comedian\\" and had begun to expand his business ventures, moving into theater in an attempt to have a black-owned and operated string of venues around the United States, a dream of his since at least 1907.Abbot and Seroff 106-107. By about 1910 Dudley was based in Washington D.C., where he served as general manager and treasurer of the Colored Actors' Union. In 1911 he set up S. H. Dudley Theatrical Enterprises, and began buying and leasing theaters to develop the first black vaudeville circuit, initially around Washington and Virginia; he had bought his first theater, in Baltimore, in 1912.Southern 297-98. In August 1912, he played his last season with the Smart Set, from then on devoting himself to his \\"circuit of theaters.\\" By 1916 the \\"Dudley Circuit\\" had extended into the south and Midwest, enabling black entertainers to secure longer term contracts for an extended season; his circuit provided the basis for the Theater Owners Bookers Association (T.O.B.A.). His circuit was advertised in a weekly column published in black newspapers, \\"What's What on the Dudley's Circuit\\", and by 1914 it included over twenty theaters, \\"all owned or operated by blacks and as far south as Atlanta.\\" T.O.B.A. was founded by people associated with Dudley's circuit, and while the organization was white-owned it had black regional managers, including Dudley (for the Washington, D.C. area). After 1917 Dudley devoted himself to producing black musicals, including updated Smart Set productions. He sold his theaters around 1930 (due to economic forces \\"beyond his control\\"), and retired to a farm in Maryland where he bred thoroughbred racehorses.

It is named after its symptoms that were first present on apples. ApMV is a positive sense RNA based virus. The disease itself has several synonyms including Mild Apple Mosaic Virus, Hop Virus, Rose Mosaic Virus, and European Plum Line Patten Virus. Overall, it causes a severe yield reduction and decreased life-expectancy of fruit trees.  Hosts, Transmission, and Symptoms  = Host Range = ApMV has a diverse host range. These positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses are capable of infecting over 65 species in 19 different families including different types of woody and herbaceous plants. This virus can infect either experimentally or naturally. Some of the natural hosts that are commonly targeted by ApMV include apples (Malus domestica), pears (Pyrus communis), apricots (Prunus armeniaca), peach (Prunus persica), plum (Prunus domestica), strawberry (Fragaria sp.), and hazelnut (Corylus avellana). = Transmission = ApMV is primarily transmitted via root grafting and via infected vegetative propagation equipment. These two transmission routes are the primary source of inoculum for the virus. Experimentally, the virus can be sap-transmitted by mechanical inoculations especially to herbaceous plants such as periwinkle (Vinca rosea) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Furthermore, ApMV is not currently thought to be seed or pollen transmitted due to limited time and space within studies. There have also been no reported insect vectors for the virus. = Symptoms = ApMV can differ from showing no symptoms to showing many symptoms on its leaf. Most popular apple cultivars are asymptomatic after infection. For plants that display symptoms, it may take up to two years to develop these symptoms. Additionally, sensitive varieties of the disease tend to have different symptoms. Possible symptoms produced tend to vary from white gray mottling on field maple to yellow chlorotic spots on hawthorn leaves. Furthermore, in plum trees, ApMV can cause line-pattern symptoms, while in roses, the symptoms are mosaic. However, the most common host, the apple tree, tends to produce pale yellow irregular spots or bands along the major veins on the leaves as they expand in the spring. The amount and severity of infected leaves with ApMV has a large dependence on temperature. Severe symptoms are pronounced during moderate spring temperatures. Partial symptoms are also commonly expressed in apple trees infected with ApMV. A Danish study conducted from 1958-1960 showed that the expression of partial symptoms are possible only a year after inoculation. Overall plants with ApMV, both moderate and severe strains, have been shown to reduce growth to 42% and decrease fruit quality.  Management  The most efficient way to manage the disease is through preventative measures and avoid planting contaminated material. Since these viruses cannot be directly removed from the plant itself, the most practical technique to manage ApMV is to plant certified trees obtained from Plant Improvement Organizations . Because ApMV can be asymptomatic for quite a while, it is also best to test for the pathogen using high sensitivity and high specificity detection methods such as ELISA. Various other techniques have been utilized to eliminate the virus from diseased plant species. A common technique used in the past is thermotherapy. Since many viruses are sensitive to elevated temperatures, utilizing heat treatment in a controlled growth chamber will deplete the symptoms for the following years. A study by Hunter et al. 1959 was conducted, where buds from virus infected trees were grafted onto healthy trees. The healthy trees with the buds were then incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 28, 30, 36 and 40 days. A year following the incubation, there were no symptoms present on the healthy tree other than from the buds. However, a potential drawback to this study was that the plants were not tested for more than a year, and sometimes symptoms can take up to two years to develop. Other studies have also reported similar results. Another study conducted by Pandey et al. (1972) suggested that plant exposure to temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius or 50 degrees Celsius for, respectively, 30 and 15 minutes were successful in inactivating ApMV. This inactivation was ultimately tested by the ELISA detection method. On the contrary, lower temperatures and low heat durations have commonly failed to inactivate the virus. Another method that has been tested is cross protection. Cross protection is a type of induced resistance that is developed among plants against viruses. During this event, a prior infection with one virus may offer protection against another closely related viruses. This technique has been tested on Johnathon apples. Healthy strains of the Johnathon apples were infected with a mild strain of ApMV and then further exposed to viral infections by moderate and severe strains. The trees infected with the mild strains were found to be resistant by further attack of the virus. As it can be seen, cross protection provides a control technique for mild strains of ApMV. All in all, as stated above, the best way to manage ApMV is through prevention. Utilizing sterile equipment and plant certified trees are the most efficient ways to get ApMV free crops. Other methods such as thermotherapy and cross protection have also been used in the past.  Environment  ApMV infects crops from all around the world including Denmark, Turkey, South Africa, New Zealand, England, Germany, Canada, Italy, Spain and the United States, including as far north as Alaska. ApMV prefers areas where there is a clear distinction between the spring and summer seasons.Svoboda J., Polak J., 2010. Relative concentration of Apple mosaic virus coat protein in different parts of apple tree. Hort. Sci. (Prague), 37: 22‚Äì26. Most samples of plants are commonly collected in the spring time for molecular determination of ApMV using ELISA. This is vital because concentration of ApMV is highly varied from season to season. ApMV is known to be a labile virus because its concentrations are negatively affected by high temperatures. In a study completed by Svoboda and Pol√°k, they observed five symptomless apple trees infected with ApMV. These five symptomless trees were selected from a pool of 472 apple trees that were inoculated with ApMV in two different orchards. Samples of various plant tissue from young leaves, flower petal, dormant buds, and phloem were taken at different time of the vegetation period. In this study, ELISA was used to detect ApMV in the different samples from the five apple trees. The relative concentrations of the virus in the leaves and flower were highest in the earlier spring months such as March and April. This suggests that the virus propagates better when it is under colder weather conditions . Furthermore, during cooler months, the virus's relative concentration is highest in the leaf and flower, rather than the phloem and dormant bud. Once May and June occur, the relative concentrations of the disease severely decreases. This was evident by Svoboda and Pol√°k's study because as the temperature rose from spring to summer, the ELISA test detected lower relative concentrations of ApMV. As a result of this heat sensitivity, symptoms of ApMV tend to be masked in the summer months versus the spring months.

He served as Vicar General of Rome from 1913 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1911. Biography Basilio Pompili was born in Spoleto, and studied at the Pontifical Roman Seminary before being ordained to the priesthood on 5 December 1886. He then did pastoral work in Rome from 1888 to 1904. During that time, Pompili was made auditor of the Sacred Congregation of the Council in 1891, an official in the Apostolic Penitentiary in 1896, and prelate adjunct of the Congregation of the Council on 16 March 1898. He was raised to the rank of a protonotary apostolic on 18 December 1899, and was named Auditor of the Roman Rota on 18 July 1904. During his time at the Roman Rota, Pompili sat at the sixth trial for the annulment of Paul Ernest Boniface and Anna Gould.TIME Magazine. Courts 13 April 1925 Pompili later returned to the Congregation of the Council upon becoming its Secretary on 31 January 1908. As Secretary, he served as the second-highest official of that dicastery, successively under Cardinals Vincenzo Vannutelli and Casimiro Gennari. Before becoming a bishop, Pompili was created Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica by Pope Pius X in the consistory of 27 November 1911. Pius X later named him Vicar General of Rome, and thus in charge of the pastoral of the diocese of Rome, on 7 April 1913. On 5 May 1913, Pompili was appointed Titular Archbishop of Philippi. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 11 May from Cardinal Antonio Agliardi, with Archbishop Donato Sbarretti and Bishop Americo Bevilacqua serving as co-consecrators, in the church of S. Vincenzo de' Paoli alla Bocca della Verit√†. In late May 1914, Pompili opted to become a Cardinal-Priest, with the title of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. He then participated in the conclave of 1914, which elected Pope Benedict XV, and was named Archpriest of the Lateran Basilica on 28 October 1914. The Cardinal Vicar was elevated to Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni on 22 March 1917, and was one of the cardinal electors in another conclave, that of 1922, resulting in the election of Pope Pius XI. In 1923, he exchanged visits with Filippo Cremonesi, a Royal Commissioner, who served as Mayor of Rome from 1922 to 1926.TIME Magazine.

She was renamed HMS Europe in 1778, and spent the rest of her career under this name. Completed too late to see service in the Seven Years' War, most of Europes service took place during the American War of Independence, supporting fleet movements and serving as the flagship for a number of admirals, including John Montagu, Molyneux Shuldham and Mariot Arbuthnot. During her time in North American waters she took part in the attack on Saint Pierre and Miquelon in 1778, and the battles of Cape Henry on 16 March and the Chesapeake in 1781. Her last notable commanders as the war drew to a close were John Duckworth and Arthur Phillip, the latter taking her to the East Indies before returning after the conclusion of the war. Europe was then reduced to ordinary in the draw down of the navy following the end of hostilities, and was not reactivated on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. She only returned to service in 1796, recommissioning as a prison ship based at Plymouth, in which role she served out the remainder of the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars, finally being broken up in 1814. Construction and commissioning She was ordered from Henry Adams, of Lepe on 16 December 1761, laid down at his yards in February 1762, and launched there on 21 April 1765. By this time the Seven Years' War was over and she was ordered to be fitted for ordinary rather than entering active service immediately, a process completed by the 5th of May 1765. She had received the name Europa on 18 April 1763, while under construction. The outbreak of the American War of Independence led to a need for more ships, and an Admiralty order was issued on 19 September 1777 for her to be refitted and then prepared for sea. She was taken in hand at Portsmouth Dockyard, which had already been working on a small repair since October 1776, and she was commissioned in September 1777 under her first captain, Timothy Edwards. She was renamed HMS Europe on 9 January 1778, and completed her fitting out in March that year. Service Edwards was succeeded by Captain Francis Parry in April 1778, and Europe became the flagship of Vice-Admiral John Montagu, under whom she sailed for Newfoundland in May 1779. She was part of the attack on Saint Pierre and Miquelon on 14 September 1778, and later that month Parry was succeeded by Captain Thomas Davey, serving with Molyneux Shuldham's squadron. In April 1779 she came under the command of Captain William Swiney, by now serving as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot, and after some time in home waters she sailed again for North America in May 1779. Captain Smith Child took over command of Europe in August 1780, and she participated in the battles of Cape Henry on 16 March and the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781. During the Battle of the Chesapeake she formed the leading part of the centre division, along with the 74-gun , and was heavily involved in the fighting. These two ships suffered heavy damage, with Europe in a leaking condition, with her rigging badly cut, and a number of guns dismounted. Nine members of her crew were killed, and a further 18 wounded. The British fleet eventually withdrew from the action. She was then paid off in March 1782, undergoing a refit at Plymouth between May and September that year, during which time she was coppered. Europe was recommissioned in August 1782 under the command of Captain John Duckworth, with command passing the following year to Captain Arthur Phillip. He sailed to the East Indies in January 1783, returning the following year and paying Europe off in May 1784. She was fitted for ordinary at Plymouth in July 1784, and spent the rest of the years of peace in this condition. =French Revolutionary Wars= Europa was recommissioned during the French Revolutionary Wars, in July 1796. She was used as a prison ship at Plymouth under Lieutenant John Gardiner, until being paid off again in September 1800. Recommissioned again in September 1801 under Lieutenant Thomas Darracot, she again served as a prison ship until being paid off in March 1802. =Napoleonic Wars= She was again in service, still as a prison ship, between November 1804 and December 1809, under Lieutenant William Styles, and was briefly commissioned in 1814 under Lieutenant John Mills Mudge. Europe was finally broken up at Plymouth in July 1814. Notes References *Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850. Conway Maritime Press. .

The show was produced and hosted by Billy Kimball, and the theme song was composed by Carter Burwell. Episodes were broadcast weekdays at 10:30 AM and 6:30 PM. Format Clash! was presented in an absurdist quiz show format in which two teams of three players each competed for prizes. Contestants were selected based on criteria such as occupation, ethnicity, religion, etc. and each team would represent one half of a rivalry. For example, an episode might pit nudists against fashion designers, librarians against noisy people, or vegetarians against butchers. Some rivalries were altered for comedic effect, such as \\"Cowboys vs. Indians\\" in which the Indians were people from India. The game was played in three rounds. In each of the first two rounds the teams were shown four categories with four questions. The questions were each worth ten points in the first round, and twenty in the second round, with no penalty for a wrong answer. The second round had one question replaced with a \\"Grudge Match\\" in which the one member of each team competed against each other in a bizarre stunt of some sort.David Schwartz, Steve Ryan and Fred Wostbrock, The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows, 3rd ed., Checkmark Books, 1999, p. 42 The third round consisted of three questions increasing in value of 50, 100, and 150 points. In this round, points were deducted for wrong answers. The team with the highest score won a prize and advanced to the \\"Oval of Odds\\" bonus round. The contestant who scored the most points for their team spun a six-spaced wheel and answered a single question. Giving the correct answer won a bonus prize. Five of the spaces each had a question that was extremely difficult (\\"What is the third word on the thirty- third page of the third book from the right on the third shelf of the third cabinet from the left in the Clash library?\\") while the last space had a question that was extremely easy (\\"What did you have for breakfast this morning?\\" or \\"How are you?\\").

It won the 2007 Branford Boase Award and the Eil√≠s Dillon Award. Plot summary A Swift Pure Cry opens a year after the mother of fifteen-year-old Michelle \\"Shell\\" Talent dies, leaving her husband and three children to cope with her death. The eldest of the children, Shell is given the responsibility to care for her younger siblings as well as continue attending school as their father changes drastically. When a new priest, Father Rose, comes to their village, Coolbar, Shell begins to believe once again in Jesus and in her mother's spirit. However, her father is also changed by religion; he quits his job to only collect money for church drives, leaving Shell and her family in poverty. At school, Shell's only friends are Declan, the altar boy, and Bridie, another misfit teen. As Shell feels more and more isolated from normal family life, she becomes involved with Declan, who makes her promise not to tell anyone, so he can continue seeing Bridie as well. Unfortunately, Declan abandons both girls for America, leaving Shell pregnant and alone. She manages to hide the pregnancy from her father and gives birth to a stillborn child around Christmas, whom she names Rose, for the priest. Around the same time, another baby is found dead, killed by exposure, and Shell is under suspicion of abandoning her child. The town is in an uproar, as is the rest of Ireland, and Shell finds comfort in Father Rose's help. However, Father Rose believes Shell's father to be the baby's father and the town folk believes that Father Rose is the father. In the end, it is revealed that Bridie was also pregnant from Declan and gave birth around the same time as Shell, but her child survived. Faced with pressure and despair, she left her child outside to die. Concluding, Shell returns to school and Father Rose is transferred to another location in Ireland for training. Characters Shell: The fifteen-year-old main character of A Swift Pure Cry. She is intelligent, but unmotivated and is often bitter about her father's role in the family. She misses her mother and maintains religious behavior. Trix: Shell's younger sister who attends a primary school along with Jimmy. She is very innocent and childlike, enjoying games and songs, while at the same time capable of acting mature for her age. Jimmy: Shell's younger brother, age nine. Jimmy has his mother's talent for playing music, but is very hot-tempered at times. He, like Trix, can handle situations that are dangerous. Mr. Talent: Shell's father. He used to be a level-headed man. However, when his wife died, he fell into alcoholism and religious collecting. Because of his alcoholic habits, he believes that he is Shell's child's father. Father Rose: The young, twenty-five-year-old priest, new to Coolbar. He is described as having a friendly and personal manner, while at the same time able to seriously discuss religion and Christianity. The town folk do not trust him completely and find his way of teaching suspect. Because of this, his relationship with Shell is often strained. Bridie: Shell's teenage friend. Birdie is considered to be a rebel in the school, but an outcast too. She steals regularly from the town's stores and also smokes. She also is having sex with Declan and possibly runs away to Cork. She is pregnant and it is her baby in the cave. Declan: The slightly older altar boy from Coolbar that Shell engages in a relationship. He is cheerful and playful, with a knack for creating mini poems. After sleeping with Shell for several months, he leaves her for America, where he eventually remembers Shell and writes to her. He is a player, having sex with Bridie and Shell. Rose: Shell's stillborn baby, named after Father Rose. Half sister of the baby in the cave.

The first event occurred in 1984 when a fifteen-year-old girl, Anne Lovett, died from blood loss and exposure while trying to give birth on her own. Critics blamed her death on the town folk who failed to give her guidance and aid. The second incident (Kerry Babies) involved a woman in her 20s giving birth to a child, rumoured to be the result of an affair with a married man, and a baby being found stabbed to death around the same time. As in A Swift Pure Cry, controversy arose over whether the woman killed her child and if she did not, who the second child belonged to.

Development Everyday Shooter was developed in the span of a few months by Jonathan Mak using Visual C++. After his last project, Gate 88, which Mak called a \\"complicated mess of rules and controls\\", Mak desired to make a much simpler game. Initially the game started out as a puzzle game inspired by Mak's interest in Lumines and Every Extend Extra, however Mak had trouble with this route and decided instead to turn the game into a shooter. In addition to programming and graphic design, Mak recorded and implemented an all-guitar soundtrack to the game. Sony Computer Entertainment took notice of the game at the 2007 Independent Gaming Festival and published it for the PlayStation 3 on October 11 as a downloadable game on the PlayStation Network. Gameplay Everyday Shooter is a dual-stick, multidirectional shooter. In the game's \\"Normal Play\\" mode, the player maneuvers a small dot through eight different levels. The gameplay dynamics (enemy types, chaining systems, etc.) change with each level, encouraging the player to observe their surroundings closely to best adapt to new rule sets. Jonathan Mak describes the game as \\"...an album of games exploring the expressive power of abstract shooters. Dissolute sounds of destruction are replaced with guitar riffs harmonizing over an all-guitar soundtrack, while modulating shapes celebrate the flowing beauty of geometry.\\" In addition to unique background music for every stage, the player creates dynamic music as they interact with the environment. For example, shooting one type of enemy will trigger a guitar note or riff, while destroying another enemy will result in a different guitar sample. Initially, the only way to play the game is through \\"Normal Play\\" which presents the player with all eight stages in order from first to last. However, points scored in the game can be used to unlock several features such as a \\"Shuffle Mode\\". Similar to using a shuffle mode on any music player, turning on shuffle mode in the game will reconfigure the order of the stages except the final. Other unlockable features include various graphic filters and the ability to increase the number of lives the player has at the beginning of a game. The player may also unlock the stages to make them available individually in \\"Single Play\\". After completing a run through normal mode, a new game mode is unlocked. \\"Travel Mode\\" allows the player to play either the main game or individual stages while being invincible, at the cost of the points scored in this mode being unusable to unlock anything. Reception The PlayStation 3 and PC versions received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PSP version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. A review from 1UP.com said that the PS3 version \\"succeeds wildly as an engaging shooter for the art-house crowd, and a creative change of pace for the hardcore-shooter crowd.\\" Some critics pointed out similarities to the game Rez, while The A.V. Club pointed out homages to classic arcade games such as Centipede, Robotron 2084, and Time Pilot. Many publications cited the PS3 version's difficulty as a source of frustration, though some pointed out that its unlocking system can ease the process of getting through \\"Normal Play\\" (or, that it can be bypassed altogether by unlocking songs in \\"Single Play\\"). IGN also criticized the method of point-collecting: Points in Everyday Shooter must be physically collected by the player in the brief amount of time after they appear or else they'll quickly fade away. In IGN's PS3 version review, it was noted that \\"flying over all the points is far less effective than it should be, since zipping through a huge clump of them will often yield only a few actual pick- ups.\\" See also *List of downloadable PlayStation 3 games References External links * Everyday Shooter official website * GDC: Nikki Inderlied Gets the Low-Down on Everyday Shooter on YouTube * Category:2006 video games Category:Independent Games Festival winners Category:Multidirectional shooters Category:Music video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Windows games ","title":"Everyday Shooter"},{"id":"12236304","text":"A modern electronic note counter with counterfeit detection capabilities A banknote counter or bill counter is a device designed primarily to accurately count a quantity of banknotes. Additionally, a banknote counter may sort banknotes into batches and check for damaged or counterfeit notes.  History  The first automatic bill counting machines (or money counting machines) were introduced in the 1920s in the United States and were produced by the Federal Bill Counter Company of Washington, D.C. These machines were designed to increase efficiency in tellers in the Federal Reserve Bank and reduce human error. The machine would stop once a set ‚Äúbatch‚Äù of notes was reached allowing a teller to insert a wooden block to keep batches separate.Wells, Donald (2004) The Federal Reserve System: A History (Chapter 6) New York: Digital Vision Modern counting machines use a technology developed by Tokyo Calculating Machine Works of Shinagawa, Tokyo and introduced in 1962. It quickly dominated the market for increased speed and accuracy.Tavlas, George S. and Yuzuru Ozeki (1992) The Internationalization of Currencies: An Appraisal of the Japanese Yen (Occasional Paper (Intl Monetary Fund)) Washington: International Monetary Fund In 1981 computerized friction note counters were introduced in the form of the REI High-Speed machine, which sped up note counting to 72,000 notes per hour and eliminated the need manual sorting and counting completely. This innovative Sorter machine could also sort notes according to their value and remove counterfeit or heavily damaged notes. Many of these features are present in today‚Äôs note counting machines, some of which can detect a note's security features (e.g. magnetic ink, ultraviolet ink, magnetic strip, note density etc.) to identify counterfeit and damaged notes.http://www.google.com/patents?id=ROoJAAAAEBAJ Other extra features that facilitate everyday contact with cash may also be present.  Electronic counters for bills/ money and coins  Electronic counting systems, with no moving parts, exist that count both notes and coins on the same machine and sum the value of all denominations counted. They are normally used to count individual deposits or the content of cash drawers and do not sort or check for counterfeit or damaged notes. The machine uses a LC display with a back light so that the total amount of the notes is shown brightly and is easy to see. These cash counters do not examine each note or coin separately but work by using finely calibrated loadcells to assess a number of notes or coins at a time, and using a constantly updated, stored average weight to compute the number of pieces it has been presented with. These machines often use complex algorithms to take into consideration the variation in the condition of the money arising from wear, humidity and production variances. Electronic cash counters tend to be small in size, silent, battery operated, very fast and accurate. They are often used on the desktops of bank tellers to check customer deposits or withdrawals or by retailers to count money from cash registers. Although their capability varies by model, typically they can count both notes and coins and check standard bank bundles or bags/rolls of coin to ensure that they are correct. This technology was invented in 1979 by Edgar Biss who went on to form the global company Tellermate.  Counterfeit detection  With more & more counterfeit bills bleeding into circulation, it is faster and more accurate to rely on money counters that are able to utilize the security features in currency. Using money counters save a person vast amount of time, eliminate human error while counting, and don‚Äôt let counterfeit money to pass. Most of bill counters have counterfeit detection measures including ultraviolet (UV) and magnetic (MG) detection. This means the counter will scan the ultraviolet properties of the bills and the magnetic ink at the same time it is counting the currency. Most counters will stop and alert the user when a counterfeit banknote is detected. While counterfeit transactions can cost small businesses millions of dollars annually, counterfeit detection feature helps to reduce losses due to suspected counterfeits. Ultraviolet Detection (UV) Ultraviolet Detection works by shining a UV light as a bill passes through the machine. When the bill goes under ultraviolet light, the security thread becomes visible and glows pink. This causes the security thread in the bill to glow pink. If the security thread glows any other color it will be flagged as a counterfeit a will be rejected. Magnetic Detection (MG) Counterfeit money detectors use magnetic detection to identify the magnetic ink and metal threads placed on strategic areas of bank notes. Magnetic detection works by detecting the magnetic threads & magnetic ink in a bill as it passes through the machine.  Mixed Bill Counters or Reader  Unlike a money counter, a Mixed Bill Counter & Reader is able to read a mix stack of bills as it's fed through and automatically determine what denomination it is ($1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills), while providing a total added value as well as a breakdown of all bills counted by their denomination.

Micrometastases are too few, in size and quantity, to be picked up in a screening or diagnostic test, and therefore cannot be seen with imaging tests such as a mammogram, MRI, ultrasound, PET, or CT scans. These migrant cancer cells may group together to form a second tumor, which is so small that it can only be seen under a microscope. Approximately ninety percent of people who die from cancer die from metastatic disease, since these cells are so challenging to detect. It is important for these cancer cells to be treated immediately after discovery, in order to prevent the relapse (regrowth of the cancer) and the likely death of the patient. Detection of micrometastatic cells The major concern with micrometastases is that the only way to determine if they are present in distant tissue is to remove cells from where they are located and look at slices of the tissue under the microscope. The typical biopsy procedure involves hematoxylin and eosin (H&E;) staining of specific markers that correspond to the particular tumor type. Although surgeons are able to remove parts of a single lymph node from the body to screen, it is impossible to remove every lymph node and other organs (lungs, liver, bones, etc.) to look for spread. Doctors must assume that the tumor cells have likely spread to other regions of the body if micrometastases are present in one of the lymph nodes. The presence or absence of micrometastases is crucial in choosing the right treatment option for cancer patients. The detection of micrometastases in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) is the primary indicator of its spread to the regional lymph nodes, bone marrow, peripheral blood and ultimately to distant metastatic sites, since they are the first of the nodes that cancer would travel to. This concept pertains to melanoma, breast cancer, and other solid tumors, including colorectal, gastroesophageal, lung, head and neck, vulvar, and penile cancers. Therefore, the presence of these cells in the SLN can make help predictions regarding the patient‚Äôs diagnosis and prognosis. For example, it has been found that the prognosis of women who have micrometastases to the sentinel lymph node have a poorer prognosis than women who do not have any evidence of tumor in these lymph nodes. The same applies to patients with melanoma and the other solid tumor cancers. Before the micrometastases colonize at a distant site, the tumor cells can be found in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Tumor cells found in the bone marrow are known as disseminated tumor cells (DTCs), and those found in the peripheral blood are known as circulating tumor cells (CTCs). These cells have successfully left the primary tumor microenvironment and the SNLs, and are able to survive in a non-native environment, which makes them more aggressive. Treatment of micrometastases In breast cancer patients, if micrometastases are present in the SLN, removal of these nodes is often the next step in treatment. Axillary lymph node dissection involves the excision of the nodes from the armpit, or axilla, region. Depending on the progression of the cells, the surgeon will determine the level of dissection that is required. Level one is the least invasive, as it involves just the removal of tissue around the axillary vein, while level three is the most aggressive as it removes all of the nodal tissue from the axilla. It may be necessary to remove other lymph nodes in addition to the SLN. Each woman has a different number of lymph nodes in her body, so determining how many nodes to remove is not based on location, rather than number. The lymph nodes serve as a filtering system for the lymphatic system, so it is important to preserve as many as possible, while also ridding the body of all cancer cells. In order to eliminate micrometastases that are not near lymph nodes and have traveled to distant regions of the body, chemotherapy and radiation therapies are necessary. However, since most micrometastatic tumor cells are in the nonproliferative G0 phase, standard cytotoxic chemotherapies may not be as useful. Therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy are more effective to eliminate micrometastases, since they are aimed to target dividing and quiescent cells. Adjuvant therapies are administered after the removal of the lymph nodes. The significance of these therapies is to serve as a ‚Äúclean up‚Äù method for those cells that have migrated elsewhere from the primary tumor. It is still in question by researchers whether this treatment method to rid the body of this small cluster of cells that may or may not progress is worth the side effects that it may cause. Side effects include fatigue, hair loss, nausea, or vomiting. In addition, adjuvant therapies do not always result in a cure and they do not benefit all patients.

Course The river rises to the north east of Bridgend town, in South Wales, where two minor rivers known as Ewenny Fach and Ewenny Fawr join. Ewenny Fach is considered a tributary of the Ewenny Fawr, which in turn is formed when three streams, Nant Canna, Nant Ciwc and Nant Crymlyn join. This branch of the river flows southeast, past the village of Pencoed and under the M4 Motorway until it is joined by the Ewenny Fach south of Junction 35 of the road . From here, the river turns southward and flows through the Ewenni Moor, past the village of Waterton. Waterton is the site of a large industrial estate, and a few miles of meandering river were straightened and diverted to prevent flooding. The river flows through the villages of Ewenny and Ogmore, before entering the River Ogmore estuary just below where Ogmore Castle is on the river..

Life and career  Woolstencroft was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. She held a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Calgary and a Master of Arts from Central Michigan University. She was married to Peter Woolstencroft, a university administrator and professor of political science at the University of Waterloo. She taught a wide range of classes, from advanced Shakespeare classes in high schools to basic literacy and life skills courses for adult learners. In addition to a long-term teaching career at Conestoga College in Waterloo Region, she taught courses on environment issues and problem-solving at the University of Waterloo. She received many awards for her political and community service, most notably the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal and the Jack Young Civic Award, Waterloo Region's highest recognition for civic service. Her commitment to enhancing the quality of the environment in Waterloo resulted in the city being cited as the Greenest city in Ontario by TVO. The Grand River Conservation Authority awarded her a posthumous award in the fall of 2013 to honour her environmental leadership in her forty years of community work and public service.  Political career  In the 1985 Ontario election, she was a candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in Waterloo North, and was defeated. She also stood as the candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the 1993 federal election in the riding of Waterloo, and in the 1997 federal election in the riding of Kitchener‚ÄîWaterloo; she was defeated both times. Woolstencroft served as a trustee on Waterloo County Board of Education (1970‚Äì1972, 1974‚Äì1985), including being elected chair from 1979 to 1982. She also served as President of the Association of Large School Boards in Ontario in 1984 and 1985. Woolstencroft served as a councillor for the City of Waterloo for three terms, from 1985‚Äì1988, 1988‚Äì1991, and 1997‚Äì2000. In 2000 she was elected as Mayor of Waterloo, Ontario. Her tenure as mayor was dominated by the RIM Park scandal, involving the financing of RIM Park with a loan from MFP Financial Services of Mississauga, a deal which had occurred before her time as mayor but which she had supported as a councillor. This ultimately led to a full judicial inquiry of the RIM Park deal, at which Woolstencroft testified and argued she had merely been a \\"peripheral councillor on this\\". During her time as mayor, the city of Waterloo entered into agreements that resulted in the establishment of the Perimeter Institute, the Centre for International Governance Innovation, and the Research and Technology Park at the University of Waterloo. In the municipal election of November 2003, Woolstencroft was defeated by former mayor and MPP Herb Epp.  Death  Woolstencroft died May 13, 2013 at the age of 69.

Aside from its traditional bus operations, it operated an air taxi service with a De Havilland Fox Moth between 18 July and 31 October 1932 and for many years owned Dryburgh Abbey Hotel. Following legislation, which allowed railway companies to invest in bus operators, the London & North Eastern Railway and London, Midland & Scottish Railway took a major stake in SMT in 1929. In 1930, following the takeover of another operator, SMT started its Edinburgh to London express coach service. SMT also acquired control of Walter Alexander & Sons bus services and coachbuilding operations, the Alexander family joining the SMT board. SMT grew partly through the acquisition of smaller companies. Operations were decentralised to local areas, such as Central SMT in Lanarkshire, and Western SMT in south-west Scotland (both with red buses), whilst the east of Scotland services operated as SMT (with green buses). Upon nationalisation of the SMT group's bus and coach services by the Attlee government in 1949, those of SMT itself were transferred to a new British Transport Commission subsidiary, Scottish Omnibuses Limited, which continued to operate as \\"SMT\\" until the early 1960s, when the fleet name \\"Eastern Scottish\\" was adopted. Meanwhile, the non bus operating activities remained in private hands as SMT Sales & Service Limited. Following the demise of the British Transport Commission, the SMT operations became part of the state-owned Scottish Bus Group in 1962; this later became the Scottish Transport Group in 1969 following the addition of ferry services. The Transport Act 1985 led to the deregulation of bus services across the United Kingdom, followed by privatisation of the bus-operating Scottish Transport Group subsidiaries. Western Scottish (formerly Western SMT) was sold to its local management in 1991, and was bought out by the Stagecoach Group in 1994, which renamed it Stagecoach West Scotland. The ferry services, run as Caledonian MacBrayne remain owned by the Scottish Government. Following privatisation, Eastern Scottish briefly reverted to its former name SMT. It was bought out by GRT Group in October 1994. In June 1995 GRT Group and Badgerline merged to create First Bus. Soon after this, SMT was split into two, with operations passing to neighbouring Lowland and Midland Bluebird, although the SMT name and livery were initially retained. In 1999 the former SMT operations, along with those of Lowland and Midland Bluebird, were rebranded as First Edinburgh.

The area is bordered by the Don River, King Street, Parliament Street and the rail line adjacent to the Gardiner Expressway. It is in size. A former industrial area, the area is being rebuilt as a mixed-use neighbourhood. History After the purchase of Toronto, the area was set aside as a Crown Reserve when York was founded. The area from Berkeley east to the Don River and north to Queen Street was designated for a large city park. It was sold off to private developers in the 1830s to finance the construction of a new city hospital. The Corktown community grew and was home to working- class Irish immigrants. To the south, the Gooderham and Worts distillery was founded, and it dumped its waste in the area. It kept cattle and pigs in the area to feed off the distillery waste, but this introduced a manure problem. Railways came to Toronto in the 1850s, entering the Don Lands along the Don River from the north, and across the Don River from the east. The Don River was straightened and the Taddle Creek which ran through the area was buried. By the late nineteenth century, most of the land was industrial or owned by the railways, and it became the site of an array of factories and warehouses, including William Davies Company, one of the largest pork processing facilities in the world. Cherry Street Hotel building from Cherry Street and Front Street. The Davies Company and Gooderham's were prosperous in the first half of the twentieth century, but both sites were in decline. Davies merged with other meatpackers and moved the bulk of its operations to the west of Toronto. Gooderham's was merged with the Hiram Walker distillery and moved much of its production to the Hiram Walker facility out of town. The Davies Company closed in the 1980s, and Gooderham's closed in 1991. By the 1980s, the area was heavily polluted and not a desirable location for the industry, which sought locations for large one-story facilities in the suburbs. The area declined and much of the land abandoned as it required expensive clean-up before conversion to other uses. Another factor against conversion to other uses was that the lands were floodplains and as such could not be the site of residences. =Failed Ataratiri project (1987‚Äì2001)= In 1987, the area was expropriated by the Ontario government at the urging of Toronto mayor Art Eggleton. The city proposed creating a new community of 14,000 called Ataratiri to solve Toronto's pressing subsidized housing crisis. The Ataratiri project was to have consisted of a mix of subsidized and market-priced housing, similar to the development of the St. Lawrence neighborhood further west. The name for the project was taken from the Wyandot word for \\"supported by clay\\" in reference to the clay soil of the area. After investing a considerable amount of money purchasing and clearing the site, the project eventually failed to attract private investors. The industrial history meant the soil was highly polluted and needed expensive cleanup before any residents could live there. The risk of flooding from the Don River also required a flood barrier to be erected. By 1992, the city and province had already invested some million, and new estimates put the final cost at more than a billion dollars more. The real estate market had also collapsed, making any private investment unlikely. The new Ontario government of Bob Rae thus decided to cancel the project in 1992. The land sat mostly unused. A number of plans were advanced for the land. For a time the provincial government considered selling it to a developer who wanted to build a harness racing facility, but local opposition put a halt to it. The lands were also a central part of Toronto's bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2001, Ontario Premier Mike Harris pushed for a complete redevelopment of Toronto's waterfront, but mayor Mel Lastman objected to the idea of removing parts of the Gardiner Expressway. During Lastman's six years in office, no progress was made on redeveloping the site. =Redevelopment (2001‚Äìpresent)= West Don Lands in 2009, prior to redevelopment Construction at the West Don Lands from Corktown Common in 2013 In 2001, the new Waterfront Toronto agency was commissioned by the federal, provincial and municipal governments to redevelop the Toronto waterfront. It was given the responsibility to take lands owned by either of the three levels of government in the waterfront area and make them available for development, sometimes building infrastructure such as parks or roads to make development possible. A flood protection landform was built to allow development to proceed. In 2006, the agency announced a new plan to create a residential community in the abandoned area. Under the overall plan of the Waterfront Toronto initiative, plans for the area include nearly 6,000 new residential spaces with twenty percent being allocated as 'affordable' or 'subsidized' housing.Bunce, Susannah. 2009. \\"Developing sustainability: sustainability policy and gentrification on Toronto's waterfront.\\" Local Environment 14 (7): 651-667. Redevelopment plans include extensive integration with Toronto transit routes and of public greenspace. The new Corktown Common is to be the recreational core of the project, linking the Don Valley Discovery Walk to the Toronto waterfront. The location is central to providing improved non-vehicular access from throughout the city to hundreds of thousands of pedestrians, cyclists, inline skaters and mobility scooter users. U.S. Ambassador Bruce Heyman visits the Athletes Village during the 2015 Pan- Am Games. Development of the Athletes Village in the West Don Lands was announced in 2009. The plan was envisaged to take 12 years to develop. This changed in 2009 when it was announced that the West Don Lands would be the home of the athlete's village for the 2015 Pan American Games. Bounded by Old Eastern Avenue, Cherry Street, Mill Street and Bayview Avenue, the development now is being referred to as Canary District. To build the athlete's village in six years, Infrastructure Ontario/Ontario Realty Corporation contracted out the development of the village on a \\"fixed-price\\" contract with developer DundeeKilmer for $514 million. This included roadways, a YMCA and George Brown College student residence. The village buildings, encompassing 787 units, were completed in time for the games and individual units will be finished with kitchens and finishings for residents after the games. Two further residential buildings will be constructed by the developer. In August 2012, Toronto Mayor Ford officially opened Underpass Park, a new public space in the West Don Lands district. The Corktown Common park to the east of Bayview was completed in 2013. It serves as open space, recreational space and a flood barrier for the development. Bayview Avenue was re-routed around the park to connect to Front Street at the west end of the park. In 2014, Toronto Community Housing opened three new buildings in the neighbourhood. A two-building four-storey apartment complex of 115 units for families opened at St. Lawrence and River Streets. An eight-storey building of 128 one-bedroom units for seniors opened on King Street East. Two heritage buildings at the corner of Front and Cherry were preserved and will be re-purposed at a future date. In June 2016, the 514 Cherry streetcar line began operations in the West Don Lands. In August 2015, rails for a new streetcar line along Cherry Street were completed as far south as the Distillery District. The rails are in a right-of-way along the eastern side of Cherry and Sumach streets. The new 514 Cherry streetcar line began operation in June 2016. In April 2016, the conversion of the Pan-Am Games village was completed. The fencing around the area was removed and residents of the Canary District development moved into their buildings in May 2016. YMCA also opened in the same month. In fall 2016, the George Brown Student Residence building opened to students.

Neuenstadt Castle  Life  Frederick Augustus was the first-born child of Duke Frederick of Neuenstadt who established the second branch line of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg-Neuenstadt. His wife was Clara Augusta of Brunswick. The branch line of W√ºrttemberg- Neuenstadt held responsibility for the town of Neuenstadt am Kocher, M√∂ckm√ºhl and parts of Weinsberg. They bore the title of duke although they held no state sovereignty which remained within the main duchy of W√ºrttemberg. In 1674 the state became embroiled in the Franco-Dutch War. Frederick Augustus sided with Brunswick-L√ºneburg, joining their regiment as a Rittmeister (a commissioned cavalry officer in charge of a squadron). He was involved in a number of key battles, including the Battle of Konzer Brucke outside Trier in which the horses he was riding were killed three times. Before the end of the war his father called for his return in order to name him successor to the duchy and remove him from subsequent danger. Frederick Augustus married Countess Albertine Sophie Esther on 9 February 1679, the last remaining member of the counts of Eberstein (now known as Alt-Eberstein). This brought ownership of the Kraichgau towns such as Gochsheim, Waldangelloch and properties along the border to Lorraine. The newly weds had Gochsheim Castle renovated and used it as their residence from 1682 onwards. Frederick Augustus's father died in March of the same year, leaving his son to take on the business of running the duchy. In 1689 French troops crossed the river Rhine during a campaign of the War of the Grand Alliance. Frederick Augustus withdrew to the north east corner of his duchy, taking up residence in Neuenstadt. In his absence, the town and castle in Gochsheim were almost completely destroyed by the French enemy. It was not until the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 that reconstruction work started again and Frederick Augustus brought in 220 Waldensians and Huguenots which he settled in a specially planned town coined ‚ÄúAugustistadt‚Äù (Augustus town) to the north of Gochsheim. The project ran into one difficulty after another and enjoyed mediocre success such that most settlers soon moved on again. Despite this, the castle was ready for occupation again in 1700. Duke Frederick Augustus died of dysentery on 6 August 1716 in Gochsheim. His grave still stands in the Martinskirche church in Gochsheim, next to his wife who died in 1728. Gochsheim became an obsolete fiefdom. As the couple had no surviving male children, Frederick Augustus‚Äôs brother, Carl Rudolf, succeeded him as Duke of W√ºrttemberg- Neuenstadt. The inner courtyard of Gochsheim Castle which was rebuilt by Frederick Augustus in 1700 Spoute With Wornstein  Throughout Frederick Augustus' early life, turmoil existed between him and his youngest brother Wornstein L Schmidt. Due to Schmidt's adoption into the Augustus family, and Schmidt's desire to keep is family name, tensions between the two grew dramatically over their lifetimes. By Frederick Augustus's early 20's he and his adopted bother had long been estranged. This caused long term damage on the Augustus family dynamic with some members of the family choosing to side with Schmidt, while others stood with Fredrick. Few records remain of how, or if, this dispute formally ended however records indicate that on multiple occasions Wornstein was arrested and sent to prison. The prison cell he was placed in, according to record was nicknamed \\"Hell In A Cell\\" leading back to nineteen ninety-eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off h–µll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer‚Äôs table. Family  Frederick Augustus fathered 14 children of which four children died the day they were born and only three daughters surviving to their first birthday and all three living into adulthood. The duke had autopsies done on all children to ascertain the reason of death, without success. Historians now believe that premature death was often the result of poor hygiene, spoilt milk and mistakes made during childbirth. His wife was Albertine Sophie Esther of Eberstein. Children: 1\\\\.

Listed at , 165 lb., Connolly batted left-handed and threw right-handed. A native of North Smithfield, Rhode Island, Connolly was a prominent member of the Boston Braves World Champions. As for his defense at left field, the Boston Sunday Post wrote \\"he is fairly fast, the possessor of a strong wing (arm) and he covers a good extent of territory.\\" Connolly made his professional debut as a pitcher in 1906 with the Putnam, Connecticut team of the New England League. From 1908 to 1912, he divided his playing time with Class-A Little Rock and Class-B Zanesville teams, playing some outfield when he was not pitching. In 1909, while in Zanesville, he posted a 23‚Äì8 record and hit .308 during the season. The following year, despite he pitched for a sixth-place team that ended 16 games below .500, he went 16‚Äì17, including a no-hitter, a one-hitter, a two-hitter, and four three-hitters, but he was beginning to experience arm trouble. In 1911 he played exclusively at left field, but financial problems forced Zanesville to send him to Terre Haute of the Central League, as he led the league hitters with a .355 batting average, adding 27 stolen bases. The Chicago Cubs signed Connolly and then traded him to the Montreal Royals of the International League, where he hit .316 in 1912. Drafted by the Washington Senators of Clark Griffith in 1913, he was sold immediately to the Boston Braves, to become the team's regular left fielder. Thought his rookie Major League season ended prematurely when he broke his ankle, Connolly led the Braves in average (.281), runs (79), RBI (57), triples (11), and slugging percentage (.410), in 126 games played. In , Connolly was a member of the Braves team that went from last place to first place in two months, becoming the first team to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.The 1914 Boston Braves at www.thisgreatgame.com He was the offensive star of the 1914 Braves, playing predominantly against right-handed pitching and usually batting third in the order at bat. He led his team with a .306 average (the only regular to hit .300), 28 doubles (fourth in the National League), nine home runs (fifth in the league), and a .494 slugging percentage (third in the league). He hit .111 (1-9) with a run and one RBI during the 1914 World Series, as the Braves defeated Connie Mack's heavily favored Philadelphia Athletics in four games. The 1915 Braves challenged for the National League and Connolly hit .298, but the following year his production and playing time decreased even more significantly, ending with a .227 average (25-for-110) in just 62 games. Boston's contract offer to Connolly for 1917 slashed his salary in half, and when he refused to sign, the Braves sold him to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. Realizing that his combined income from farming and playing semipro ball locally would exceed his salary under his professional contract, he decided to retire. In a four-season career, Connolly was a .288 hitter (358-for-1241) with 14 home runs and 157 RBI in 412 games, including 202 runs, 65 doubles, 31 triples, and 48 stolen bases. Defensively, he recorded a .967 fielding percentage primarily as a left fielder. Following his baseball career, Connelly served in the Rhode Island State Legislature. He died in his home town of North Smithfield, Rhode Island at the age of 59.

A characteristic of reverse-DNS strings is that they are based on registered domain names, and are only reversed for sorting purposes. For example, if a company making a product called \\"MyProduct\\" has the registered domain name \\"example.com\\", they could use the reverse-DNS string \\"com.example.MyProduct\\" to describe it. Reverse-DNS names are a simple way of reducing name-space collisions, since any domain name is registered by only one party at a time. History Most of the world follows the Internet standard and writes email addresses starting with the name of the computer and ending up with the name of the country. In the U.K., the Joint Academic Networking Team (JANET) had decided to do it the other way round in its Name Registration Scheme, JANET NRS, before the Internet domain standard was established. Most gateway sites have ad-hockery in their mailers to handle this, but can still be confused. In particular, the address me@uk.ac.bris.pys.as could be interpreted in JANET's big-endian way as one in the U.K. (domain uk) or in the standard little-endian way as one in American Samoa (domain as) on the opposite side of the world.Jargon File: Big-endian Reverse-DNS first became widely used with the Java platform, and has since been used for other systems, for example, ActionScript 3 packages and Android applications. Examples Examples of systems that use reverse-DNS are Sun Microsystems' Java platform and Apple's Uniform Type Identifier or UTI. The Android operating system also makes use of the notation for classifying applications, as the Dalvik virtual machine made use of Java. dconf which is the configuration back end used by GNOME. Example of reverse-DNS strings are: * com.adobe.postscript-font (UTI string for Adobe Systems's PostScript fonts) * com.apple.ostype (UTI string for Apple's OSType) * org.omg.CORBA (Java library for CORBA) * org.w3c.dom (Java library for W3C's DOM) * ar.com.mydomain (for International domains) References * External links * Eclipse Naming Conventions * Re: gnu.* namespace discussion Category:Domain Name System ","title":"Reverse domain name notation"},{"id":"12236730","text":"The Muck Crops Research Station is an agriculture research facility near Kettleby and Ansnorveldt, in Ontario, Canada. It is operated by the Office of Research at the University of Guelph. The station's research is focussed on several key areas: *Crop protection of muck vegetables *Evaluation of vegetable cultivars *Post-harvest storage and treatment *Soil and crop management The station features greenhouses with a system-controlled environment, a plant pathology laboratory, and long-term cold storage. Seven hectares of land are split into plots devoted to researching organic and mineral soils. Local growers also participate in commercial field trials on occasion. Crop protection Various long-term research projects analyze and assess the impact of indigenous and invasive pests and parasites. Since 1998, the site has studied the over-wintering ability of the pea leafminer in southern Ontario, as well as associated parasitoid complexes collected from leafminer pupae. Protection from fungi and molds during storage is also studied at this station. For example, the mold Sclerotinia releases oxalic acid, a compound that allows the mold to infect carrots. Researchers are studying the use of \\"calcium formulations to deter Sclerotinia growth\\". Vegetable cultivars One of the site's important functions is to determine the viability and suitability of specific crop cultivars in the Holland Marsh. The area is a major producer of onions, carrots, lettuce, celery and Asian vegetables. Storage and treatment The aim of research into storage of crops is to identify crops that may be grown in the Holland Marsh and stored for eventual winter distribution, so that residents of Ontario may have access to Ontario-grown vegetables year-round. Soil and crop management To improve yield and reduce the negative impact of agricultural practices on farmland, studies at this research station have attempted to identify conditions under which it is most appropriate to apply specific fertilizers. For example, nitrogen fertilizers are typically applied to carrot crops to improve yields and reduce leaf blight. Research at this station suggests that by matching the use of nitrogen fertilizers to the type of soil in which carrots are grown, high yields may be achieved. Moreover, this can be done with less nitrogen fertilizer and minimizing the use of fungicides to control leaf blight, decreasing costs and mitigating some environmental concerns.

It was founded in 1988 by the lawyers Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, LLP. As of March 2019, John Kostyack is the executive director. Since its founding, the Center has worked on whistleblower cases relating to environmental protection, nuclear safety, government and corporate accountability, and wildlife crime. Programs NWC operates three main programs: (1) providing whistleblowers with legal assistance, (2) advocating for policies that protect and reward whistleblowers such as the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act, the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act, and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, and (3) educating the public about the importance of whistleblowers to preserving democracy and the rule of law. The NWC strongly opposes efforts to weaken existing laws and pushes for strengthening laws protecting whistleblowers across sectors. Starting in 2013, the U.S. Senate has recognized National Whistleblower Appreciation Day each year on July 30th at the urging of Senator Chuck Grassley, a founding member of the Whistleblower Protection Caucus in Congress. National Whistleblower Day honors the anniversary of the United States' first whistleblower law, passed on July 30th, 1778 during the height of the Revolutionary War. The National Whistleblower Center has hosted an annual celebration on the day to honor and celebrate the contributions of whistleblowers. Past speakers have included prominent members of Congress, agency heads, whistleblowers, and whistleblower advocates. NWC Accomplishments In addition to protecting the jobs and careers of numerous whistleblowers, the Center's victories include the following: * Winning reinstatement for the highest ranking nuclear whistleblower; * Collecting millions of dollars in damages on behalf of whistleblowers; * Using the Freedom of Information Act (United States) to force government agencies to release hundreds of thousands of pages of information documenting government misconduct; * Exposing misconduct at the World Trade Center and the 9/11 crime scenes, including theft by FBI agents and the mishandling of evidence; * Documenting deficiencies in the FBI's counterterrorism program; * Requiring the FBI to create whistleblower protection for FBI agents for the first time in U.S. history; * Forcing the FBI to accredit its crime lab; * Forcing the United States Attorney General to withdraw gag orders on government employees who desired to expose ethical violations to Members of Congress; * Successfully worked with Congress to ensure passage of critical whistleblower protection laws, such as the No-FEAR Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Corporate Whistleblower Protection Act, and the Civil Rights Tax Relief Act; * Forcing President Bush to withdraw his nomination for head of enforcement at the United States Environmental Protection Agency due to former retaliation against whistleblowers; * Preventing federal agencies from gagging employee speech critical of agency policies; * Banning \\"hush money\\" payments for all environmental and nuclear federal safety cases; * Exposing the vulnerabilities of U.S. nuclear power plants to airborne terrorist attacks and forcing reforms in the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; * Ensuring that military whistleblowers are informed of their rights by the Department of Defense; * Establishing numerous legal precedents strengthening whistleblower protections for public and private sector employees, including expanding the scope of protected whistleblower speech, enjoining government regulations which restricted whistleblowing, and expanding the use of the Privacy Act to prevent the government from smearing its critics. Prominent NWC whistleblowers =Bradley (Brad) Birkenfeld= Brad Birkenfeld is a former banker and wealth manager with UBS who exposed massive tax evasion in the Swiss banking system. He made history in 2012 when he received the largest ever whistleblower reward of $104 million from the IRS Office of the Whistleblower for reporting tax fraud. His disclosures resulted in unprecedented recoveries for US taxpayers with over $5 billion collected from US citizens with illegal \\"undeclared\\" offshore accounts and $780 million paid in fines and penalties by UBS. =Marrita Murphy= In Murphy v.

Colapinto, general counsel for the National Whistleblower Center) challenged the constitutionality of taxing compensatory damages in civil rights/whistleblower cases. In August 2006, a unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of Ms. Murphy, and declared unconstitutional a special tax Congress had passed in 1996, which targeted civil rights victims who received compensation for emotional distress damages. However, in July 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed itself on the case, holding that the IRS can tax damage awards based solely on compensating victims who suffer emotional injuries. =Bunnatine (Bunny) Greenhouse= Bunny Greenhouse, former chief contracting officer of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, testified in June 2005 before a Democratic party public committee. Her testimony included allegations against Halliburton of instances of waste, fraud and other abuses with regards to its operations in the Iraq War. After standing up and \\"blowing the whistle,\\" she was demoted and removed from her position as the chief civilian contracting authority of the Corps. In July 2011, she won close to $1 million in full restitution of lost wages, compensatory damages, and attorney fees. =Jane Turner= In 1999, former FBI special agent Jane Turner brought to the attention of her management team serious misconduct concerning failures to investigate and prosecute crimes against children in Indian Country and in the Minot, North Dakota community. Turner also reported on misconduct related to the potential criminal theft of property from the 9/11 Ground Zero crime scene in New York City by Minneapolis FBI personnel. Although she was considered one of the best agents working in Indian Country, Turner's twenty-five year career with the FBI was brought to a halt when she was forced from service as retaliation for what FBI management termed as \\"tarnishing\\" the image of the FBI. =Dr. Frederic Whitehurst= Dr. Frederic Whitehurst is the Executive Director of the NWC's Forensic Justice Project. Dr. Whitehurst received a Ph.D. in chemistry from Duke University, a J.D. from Georgetown University. He joined the FBI in 1982 and served as a Supervisory Special Agent in the FBI crime lab from 1986 - 1998. In the lab, he observed procedural errors and misconduct by agents and as a result went public as a whistleblower. He retired after winning the first-ever whistleblower case against the FBI. =Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo= Dr. Coleman-Adebayo was a senior policy analyst for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). She founded two employee-rights groups, EPA Employees Against Racial Discrimination and the No FEAR coalition. Through her leadership, the No FEAR Coalition, working closely with Representative James Sensenbrenner, organized a successful grass-roots campaign and obtained overwhelming Congressional support for the \\"Notification of Federal Employees Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act.\\" The Act was signed into law by President Bush in 2002. =Dr. Jonathan Fishbein= The Center has championed the case of one of the highest ranking drug whistleblowers in American history, Dr. Jonathan Fishbein. Dr. Fishbein exposed a series of unethical and improper medical problems within the National Institutes of Health's drug safety clinical trials program. In the wake of Dr. Fishbein's allegations, the United States Department of Health and Human Services enacted sweeping conflict of interest reforms and promised protection of senior ranking employees who blow the whistle. Additionally, drug companies have instituted voluntary reforms in an effort to circumvent congressional acts. Regardless of the scandals that have rocked the drug agency, Congress has still not enacted federal protection for drug whistleblowers.

Job has finished working on Yakari. The series is now written by Joris Chamblain who is from France. Yakari has (on two occasions, 1983 and 2005Internet Movie Database:Yakari) been adapted to a cartoon series on television, a movie was announced. Yakari is one of the most well-known Franco-Belgian comics in Europe.  Concept  Yakari is a young Sioux Native American who has the ability to understand and speak animal languages. During his adventures, he meets all sorts of North American animals. His best friends are a girl Sioux, \\"Rainbow\\", a Sioux boy \\"Buffalo Seed\\" and his pony \\"Little Thunder\\". He has a totem animal, \\"Great Eagle\\", who frequently appears to him to give him critical advice. The setting is the North American Great Plains, mainly. Horses have already been introduced by the Spanish, but there is no mentioning of white man whatsoever in the series. (In one book, there's even a mention by an old tribesman that there's a mystery how the horse came to the land, and that it hasn't always been there.Yakari #16: \\"Le premier galop\\" (1990)) It can therefore be assumed that Yakari's adventures take place after the 15th century, but long before the settling rush in the late 18th/19th century. The comic shows a very positive view of the culture of the Sioux and depicts them as peaceful people who live in harmony with nature.  Characters  (English names; original French names in brackets when available, unless universally applicable) Humans: * Yakari is the main character. He is a little Sioux boy and has the ability to talk with animals; this gift was given by Great Eagle, Yakari's totem. Unlike the other young boys, Yakari rejects the use of weapons; he seems to be the only Sioux boy who does not carry a knife or bow and arrow. Yakari is also the only Sioux in the comic whose name does not mean anything further (like \\"Little Big-Shot\\"). * Rainbow (Arc-en-Ciel): A Sioux girl and Yakari's best friend. She knows of and genuinely admires his special ability, and often accompanies him on his adventures, and learns the ways of healing from Yakari's mother. * The-One-Who-Knows (Celui-qui-sait): chief and shaman of Yakari's village, and one of the first persons to understand that Yakari has a rare gift. He is the oldest and wisest man in the village. In the cartoon, he is known as Wise One. * Buffalo Seed (Graine-de-Bison): A Sioux boy and rivaling friend of Yakari's, who dreams of becoming the greatest hunter. Little Big-Shot is more aggressive than Yakari, and shows an interest in martial sports (wrestling and bowshooting). He often wears only a loincloth and despite his age, is possibly the best bowman in Yakari's village. * Slow Caribou: A man from Yakari's village. As his name points out, he is very slow, always roving about in a half-sleeping pace. In the cartoon, he is called Slow Strider. * Broth Eye: A man from Yakari's village. He is extremely lazy and unfit, and spends the day lying in front of his tipi and smoking his pipe. In the cartoon, he is called Eyes-Always-Shut, because every time he is seen he is taking a nap, and often someone steps on his belly. * Tranquil Rock (Roc- Tranquille): A sage from Yakari's village. * Bold Gaze (Regard-Droit): Yakari's father. At first quite skeptical about his son's claims that he can talk to animals, he is eventually convinced that his son does indeed have a special gift. * Braid Night: Yakari's mother, who is skilled in healing lore. In the cartoon she is called Midnight Braids. * Drawn Bow (Arc-tendu): A cruel and arrogant wandering warrior who is obsessed with hunting and bringing down the rarest and most unusual of animals. He has clashed with Yakari on several occasions and considers him to be his most personal enemy. In the cartoon, he is called Quick Bow. * Moon-Spirit: A crone who heals animals. Mounts and wild animals: * Little Thunder (Petit Tonnere): A white-and-black checkered Pinto pony stallion, who is Yakari's steed and closest friend. He refuses to wear a saddle or reins, so Yakari rides him bareback. * Double Teeth: A beaver and artist. * Tilia: A young beaver, practical joker and adventurer. * Wild Rose Plant: A beaver, and Tilia's mother. * Rough Bark: A beaver, and Tilia's father. * Thousand Mouths: A beaver and builder. * Wood of a Bed: A beaver and a serious sleeper. * Flying Squirrel: A young flying squirrel and one of Yakari's friends. * The Grizzly: Originally a savage rogue bear who terrorized the animals of the Great Plains, he has since learned humility and is now one of Yakari's friends. * Snowball: A young white bear who has suffered the stigma of being different until he makes a friend in Yakari. He has twice been targeted by Drawn Bow, who collects the furs of white animals, and saved by Yakari both times. * Carcajou: A belligerent wolverine who acts as a recurring antagonist for Yakari, and tried several times to eat his beaver and flying squirrel friends. He mellows out a bit after Yakari helps him on a few occasions. Totem animals: * Great Eagle (Grand-Aigle): A great bald eagle and Yakari's totem who aids Yakari with his wisdom and advice, and is the one who gave Yakari the gift of talking to animals. * Nanabozo: A rabbit capable of doing magical feats, and Rainbow's totem. He has revealed himself to Rainbow and Yakari on numerous occasions and taken them on educative journeys, including a trip into prehistoric times.
