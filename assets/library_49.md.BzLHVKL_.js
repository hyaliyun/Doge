Mellon founded her namesake luxury footwear brand, Tamara Mellon, with co-founder and CEO Jill Layfield and CDO Tania Spinelli in 2016. Early life Mellon was born Tamara Yeardye in London, on 7 July 1967. She is the daughter of Tom Yeardye, a stunt double for Rock Hudson, and Ann (Davis) Yeardye, a former Chanel model. Mellon is the eldest of three siblings. Her current surname stems from the time when she was married to Matthew Mellon, an American businessman and member of the prominent Mellon family. In 1976, Mellon's family relocated to Beverly Hills, in a home next door to Nancy Sinatra. Mellon alternated summers between California and the UK. She attended two independent girls' schools in Berkshire‚ÄîMarist School and Heathfield St Mary's School‚Äîbefore attending finishing school in Switzerland at the now-defunct Institut Alpin Videmanette. Career Mellon began her career at Phyllis Walters Public Relations, Mirabella, and in 1991 was employed as an accessories editor and assistant to Sarajane Hoare at British Vogue. Mellon approached bespoke shoe-maker Mr Jimmy Choo with the idea of launching a ready-to-wear shoe company. As co-founder of the Jimmy Choo company, Mellon secured funding from her father for the creation of her business, and sourced factories in Italy. In addition, she set up an office in Italy to handle production, quality control and shipping. By 2001, Jimmy Choo Ltd had over 100 wholesale clients, including Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman, and the collections accounted for over 50% of the production of several of these factories. The first Jimmy Choo store, on Motcombe Street in London, was followed by stores in New York, Las Vegas and Beverly Hills. In April 2001, Jimmy Choo Ltd partnered with Equinox Luxury Holdings Ltd. Acquiring Mr Choo's share of the ready-to-wear business, Equinox's Chief Executive, Robert Bensoussan, became CEO of Jimmy Choo Ltd, introducing handbag and small leather goods collections. In November 2004, with the company valued at ¬£101 million, Hicks Muse announced the majority acquisition of Jimmy Choo Ltd. Mellon made an estimated ¬£85 million from her eventual sale of Jimmy Choo in 2011. In 2007, Mellon appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List, where she was ranked as the 751st richest person in the UK, with an estimated wealth of ¬£99 million.\\"Rich List search\\" timesonline.co.uk. She was also ranked as the 64th richest woman in Britain.\\"Women's rich list\\". timesonline.co.uk In 2013 she stated that her eponymous luxury shoe brand would not buy from companies that lacked a female employee in an executive role. Business difficulties Mellon's shoe and apparel brand filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in December 2015. The filing stated that the company has assets of between $1 million and $10 million and also has between 100 and 199 creditors who are owed between $1 million and $10 million. She was forced to file under Section 11 following pressure from angry investors, predicted to lose approximately ¬£2.7 million. Mellon was subsequently bailed out by American equity firm NEA, with a $10 million cash injection. In January 2016, Mellon's former backers filed an objection to the restructuring plans under American bankruptcy protection laws. They stated that these plans allowed her, her fianc√© and a fund to gain control of the new company, leaving former financers with no repayment. The objection includes accusations of mismanagement and abuse of the company, including employing a life coach on the payroll and spending $100,000 on tickets to The Met Gala in New York. The US Department of Justice also filed a formal objection. In September 2016, it was revealed that Mellon is suing Jimmy Choo, alleging that the company had blocked her from using luxury shoemakers in Florence, Italy to produce her own line. Public and political activities Mellon is a member of the New Enterprise Council, a group of entrepreneurs who advise the Conservative Party on policies related to the needs of business. On 9 November 2010, she was named as a \\"global trade envoy for Britain\\" by the British Government, intended to have a \\"roving brief to promote the country‚Äôs booming fashion industry overseas\\". Mellon has served on the Board of Directors for Revlon since 2008. She is also a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Honours and awards In the 2010 Birthday Honours, Mellon was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to the fashion industry. In 2014, Tamara Mellon received the Women's Entrepreneurship Day Pioneer Award in recognition for her achievements in fashion. Personal life In 2013, Mellon published the autobiography 'In My Shoes' in which she details her rise to success and her partnership with shoe-designer Jimmy Choo. In an interview about the book with Vanity Fair, she spoke of the challenges of designing shoes for the Oscar Season. Several media publications reported on the discussion in her book about her drug-addiction issues, specifically her problems with cocaine. Subsequent news coverage also focused on her stint in rehab, party lifestyle and being fired from Vogue Magazine. Mellon's battle with alcohol addiction is also well documented and she met her first husband, Matthew, at Alcoholics Anonymous. They later divorced and she wrote a number of articles about the dramatic details of her marriage, referencing \\"snorting her way through alpine ranges of cocaine\\". In 2015 she announced her engagement to Michael Ovitz in a magazine interview with HELLO! It has since been revealed that Ovitz is still legally married to his first wife Judy. In a 2016 The Sunday Times article, she referred to the situation as \\"complicated\\".

On 1 October 1962 the arms were approved by Governor of Uganda Walter Coutts, and formally established by law on 9 October. The shield and spears represent the willingness of the Ugandan people to defend their country. There are three images on the shield: those on top represent the waves of Lake Victoria and Lake Albert; the sun in the centre represents the many days of brilliant sunshine Uganda enjoys; and the traditional drum at the bottom is symbolic of dancing, and the summoning of people to meetings and ceremony. The above explanation, about the symbolism of the drum, is a distortion that came about after the bloody 1966 national crisis when the Prime Minister of the day, Milton Obote, made a violent military attack on the king of the Kingdom of Buganda in central Uganda, Edward Mutesa II, who was the ceremonial president of the state at the time. The following year, 1967, the nation's constitution was abrogated and replaced with a new one which abolished the country's ancient monarchies‚Äîthe kingdoms of Buganda, Bunyoro, Ankole, Toro, and the Principality of Busoga, turning Uganda into a republic and making Milton Obote president with unlimited executive powers. Before Obote's rule, the drum was symbolic of royalty and the authority of Uganda's kings. On a related note, the kings of Uganda were the first to use the traditional lentil shaped African shield in their heraldic arms. The shield is flanked on the heraldic left side by a crested crane (Balearica regulorum gibbericeps), a subspecies of the grey-crowned crane and the national bird of Uganda. On the right is the Ugandan kob (Kobus kob thomasi), a subspecies of kob that here represents abundant wildlife. The shield stands on a green mound, representing fertile land, and directly above a representation of the River Nile. Two main cash crops, coffee and cotton, flank the river. At the bottom is the national motto: \\"For God and My Country\\".  Blazon  The coat of arms of Uganda is described as: * For the shield:  Sable, upon the fess point a sun in splendour and in base a Uganda drum Or, the skin and guy ropes Argent, a chief barry wavy of six Azure and Argent. Behind the shield two Uganda spears of estate in saltire proper. * For supporters:  Dexter a male Ugandan Kob (Adenota kob thomasi - Bovid√¶); sinister, a Crested Crane (Balearica pavonina gibberifrons - Balearicid√¶), both proper. * The compartment:  A grassy mount down the centre of which flows a river (the River Nile), between dexter a sprig of coffee and in sinister a sprig of cotton, both leaved and fructed proper. * With the motto: \\"FOR GOD AND MY COUNTRY\\" See also Armorial of Africa  References National symbols of Uganda Uganda Uganda Uganda Uganda Uganda Uganda Uganda Uganda Uganda ","title":"Coat of arms of Uganda"},{"id":"1843005","text":"Gander‚ÄîTwillingate was a federal electoral district in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1968 to 1988.

The home of the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the Class A South Atlantic League, it opened on April 3, 2005. The park is on the block bounded by Bellemeade, Edgeworth, Smith, and Eugene Streets. The stadium's seating capacity is 7,499 people, 5,300 of which are chair-back seats. The stadium was built to Double-A standards and has room for future expansion. In 2017, the Grasshoppers had the best average attendance in the South Atlantic League and the highest total attendance in the league. History The ballpark in 2005 The Grasshoppers moved to First National Bank Field after the 2004 season, leaving their previous home of many decades, World War Memorial Stadium. Lindsay Street, which once cut through the property of the new park, now T's into Eugene, and also provides a direct path to the old stadium. Greensboro's downtown stadium opened its gates to a crowd of 8,540 on April 3, 2005, with a Grasshoppers exhibition game against the Florida Marlins, who were their Major League Baseball affiliate. In the first regular season game, the Grasshoppers defeated the Hickory Crawdads, 3‚Äì2, in front of 8,017 fans. On May 5, 2009, it was announced that the 2010 ACC Baseball Tournament would be held at the facility, a change from the discussed location of Fenway Park in Boston, due to economic reasons. Florida State won the tournament. From May 23 to 27, 2012, the park hosted the 2012 ACC Baseball Tournament, which was won by Georgia Tech. During this time, the University of North Carolina took on North Carolina State University in a game that broke the record for attendance at a college baseball game in the state of North Carolina. It was also the largest crowd ever for an ACC baseball game. The attendance, 10,229, was the largest crowd in the history of First National Bank Field. Features A 30-foot-wide open concrete concourse wraps around the ballpark, giving fans the opportunity to see the game from any vantage point in the stadium. Fans are served at three major concession stands with 36 points of sale. Other amenities include a grandstand outdoor sports bar and a kid-safe play park. There are 16 luxury suites, 26 grandstand boxes, picnic areas, and a grandstand party deck in the left field corner. Naming rights The ballpark opened in 2005 as First Horizon Park. Memphis, Tennessee-based First Horizon National Corporation was awarded the naming rights on December 7, 2004, for 10 years. On November 7, 2007, it was formally announced that locally based NewBridge Bank had acquired the ballpark's naming rights, after First Horizon National Corporation ended their agreement with the Grasshoppers. The deal runs through the 2017 season. However, Yadkin Bank's acquisition of NewBridge Bank resulted in a name change for the ballpark, effective in the 2016 season. FNB Corporation of Pittsburgh made an offer for Yadkin Bank in 2016. The team and FNB Corporation announced March 6, 2017, that First National Bank will continue the NewBridge sponsorship, and the stadium's new name for the 2017 season would be First National Bank Field.

Plot In 1912 Sonora, Mexico, Arizona lawman Lyedecker chases Yaqui Joe, a half-Yaqui, half-white bank robber who has stolen $6,000. Both men are captured by the Mexican general Verdugo. Lyedecker learns that Joe used the loot to buy 100 rifles for the Yaqui people, who are being repressed by the government. Lyedecker is not interested in Joe's motive, and intends to recover the money and apprehend Joe to further his career. The two men escape a Mexican firing squad and flee to the hills, where they are joined by Sarita, a beautiful Indian revolutionary. Sarita has a vendetta against the soldiers, who murdered her father. The fugitives become allies. Leading the Yaqui against Verdugo's forces, they ambush and derail the General's train and overcome his soldiers in an extended firefight.

It was based on a novel by Robert McLeod. The script was originally written by Clair Huffaker. Tom Gries signed to direct following his successful feature debut with Will Penny. Gries wrote two further drafts of the script himself. \\"He says he's not a carpenter\\", reported the Los Angeles Times. \\"He says he can't work with a script that he doesn't believe in himself.\\" Huffaker later requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced with a pseudonym, \\"Cecil Hanson\\", because \\"the finished product... bears absolutely no resemblance to my original script.\\" =Casting= The leads were given to Raquel Welch (Gries: \\"in some situations, this woman is just a piece of candy but I think she will prove in this film that she can act as well\\"), Jim Brown (\\"he's a great actor with a lot of appeal\\", said Gries), and Burt Reynolds. \\"I'd like to bring a style to the screen that means something to the cats out on the street\\", said Brown. \\"It's an image I want to portray of a strong black man in breaking down social taboos. In 100 Rifles... it's a different thing for a black man to be a lawman, get the woman and ride away into the sunset.\\" It was the fifth film Burt Reynolds had made in a row. The first four ‚Äì Shark!, Fade In, Impasse and Whiskey Renegades ‚Äì had not been released when 100 Rifles was being shot. =Shooting= \\"I was playing Yaqui Joe, supposedly an Indian with a moustache\\", said Reynolds. \\"Raquel had a Spanish accent that sounded like a cross between Carmen Miranda and ZaSu Pitts. Jimmy Brown was afraid of only two things in the entire world: one was heights, the other was horses. And he was on a horse fighting me on a cliff. It just didn't work.\\" The film was shot in Almer√≠a, Spain, in order to save money. \\"It's a tough, physical picture\\", says Gries, who was hospitalised for three days during the shoot when he came down with typhus. \\"I play a half breed but... I send it up\\", said Reynolds. \\"I make it seem like the other 'half' of the guy is from Alabama. I play it nasty, dirty, funky. I look like a Christmas tree ‚Äì wrist bands, arm bands. At the beginning I even wore these funky spurs. But every time I walked I couldn't hear dialog.\\" There were a number of press reports that Brown and Welch clashed during filming. Brown later said: > The thing I wanted to avoid most was any suggestion that I was coming on to > her. So I withdrew. If I'd tried to socialise, we'd have had problems. You > know, Raquel is married too and out of respect for her husband I wanted to > deal with Raquel through him... She was so suspicious and concerned that we > were there to steal something away, or something. You can get very hung up > on who's going to get the close ups and so on... [Burt Reynolds] was usually > a stabilising influence [between the stars]... He's a heck of a cat. He had > various talks with Raquel and tried to assure her that nothing was going on, > that we weren't trying to steal anything. Welch later confirmed the tension: > It was an atmosphere. And it was really, in all seriousness, as ambiguous as > hell. I don't know why it happened and I don't think Jimmy knows why it > happened... My attitude on a film has always been, once it goes I'm > interested only in my job. I'm not interested in asserting myself on a > picture. Because it means too much to me. \\"I spent the entire time refereeing fights between Jim Brown and Raquel Welch\\", said Reynolds. He elaborated: > It started because they were kind of attracted to each other. After a while > they both displayed a little temperament, but don't forget we were out in > the middle of the bloody desert with the temperature at 110. Of course, I > don't think they'll ever work together again. The critics have really been > knocking those two ‚Äì murdering them ‚Äì but as far as I know no one ever said > they were Lunt and Fontanne. Jim is the most honest man I know... And Raquel > ‚Äì one of the gutsiest broads I know, physically. She did all her own stunts. > There's also a performance in there somewhere. Raquel Welch later said she \\"was the baloney in a cheesecake factory\\" on that film. \\"I wanted to keep up with all the action with the boys.\\" She was sorry Tom Gries \\"wanted to get all the sex scenes (with Jim Brown) in the can in the first day. There was no time for icing ‚Äì and it made it difficult for me.\\" She says Brown \\"was very forceful and I am feisty. I was a little uncomfortable with too much male aggression. But ‚Äì it turned out to be great exploitation for the film, now as you look back. It broke new ground.\\" Reception =Box office= The film opened on 26 March 1969 and grossed $301,315 in its first 5 days from nine cities. According to Fox records the film required $8,225,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $6,900,000 so made a loss to the studio. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating based on 2 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10. Quentin Tarantino said the \\"mediocre final product still seems like a shamefully wasted opportunity (I mean Jesus Christ, how do you fuck up a movie starring Jim Brown, Burt Reynolds and Raquel Welch?).\\" See also List of American films of 1969 References External links  100 Rifles at DBCult Film Institute  *Review of film at New York Times 1969 films 1960s Western (genre) drama films 20th Century Fox films African-American drama films American films African-American Western (genre) films English-language films Films about interracial romance Films about Native Americans Films based on American novels Films based on Western (genre) novels Films directed by Tom Gries Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith Films set in 1912 Films set in Mexico Films shot in Almer√≠a Mexican Revolution films 1969 drama films ","title":"100 Rifles"},{"id":"1843050","text":"Meramec State Park is a public recreation area located near Sullivan, Missouri, about 60 miles from St. Louis, along the Meramec River. The park has diverse ecosystems such as hardwood forests and glades. There are over 40 caves located throughout the park, the geology of which is a mixture of limestone and dolomite. The most famous is Fisher Cave, located near the campgrounds. The park borders the Meramec Conservation Area. History The park was acquired by the state in 1927, then saw active development by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) between 1933 and 1935. At that time, trails were laid out and numerous buildings constructed including a dining hall, recreation hall, concession building, and shelters. In the late 1970s, as part of the Meramec Basin Project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began work on a dam in the park to impound the river. The resulting reservoir would have permanently flooded much of the park and imperiled many different species, including the endangered Indiana bat. However, in response to direct citizen action against the dam, the project was halted, marking a victory for the environmental movement. Historic sites Three surviving CCC-era structures were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985: * Meramec State Park Lookout House/Observation Tower: The rustic-style stone and trussed timber octagonal lookout tower was built about 1934. * Meramec State Park Pump House: The rustic-style stone pump house (well house) on the Lodge Trail has a medium-pitched front-gable roof with small cupola. It was built in 1934. * Meramec State Park Shelter House: The rustic-style shelter house on the Lodge Trail measures 12 feet by 16 feet and has a hipped roof supported by heavy wooden posts and brackets. It was built in 1935. In 1991, the Meramec State Park Beach Area Historic District was also added to the list. The historic district encompasses four contributing buildings, three contributing structures, and one contributing object. They include the picnic shelter, stone restrooms, water fountain, pump house, and stone steps The bottom southeast corner of the park includes the old Hamilton Ironworks, after which the Ozarks fiddle tune Hamilton Ironworks is named. The Hamilton Iron Works Trail has interpretive signage about the history the blast furnace that once operated \\"around the clock, seven days a week.\\" Activities and amenities In addition to cave tours, the park offers hiking trails, fishing, swimming and boating on the Meramec River, and a campground. The visitor center houses an exhibit hall with a video presentation and information about the history and ecology of the area.

Publication history Mogo first appeared in Green Lantern vol. 2 #188 (May 1985) in a story titled \\"Mogo Doesn't Socialize\\" and was created by writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons. Although initially a one-off character from a short story, the planet has grown in importance in the Green Lantern mythos and is a necessary part of the process for distributing power rings as well as a destination for Corps members to recuperate. Fictional character biography =Background= Mogo is a sentient and living planet. It is technically genderless, but it is often casually referred to as male. When it is desired, its affiliation with the Corps is shown with foliage arranged into a green band, marked with the standard Green Lantern Corps lantern symbol, circling Mogo's equatorial area. In its early appearances, Mogo is not a social Green Lantern and its interactions with the rest of the DC universe are not well documented. It avoids announcing its presence, preferring to represent itself using pseudonymous holograms. In Mogo's first appearance, it is explained that the planet-sized Mogo's gravitational field would wreak havoc on any other planet it would try to \\"visit\\"; hence Mogo \\"doesn't socialize.\\"Green Lantern (vol. 2) #188 (May 1985) Bolphunga the Unrelenting, an alien hunter, was one of Mogo's first direct adversaries; having tracked the legendary Green Lantern Mogo to the planet where he apparently 'resided', Bolphunga subsequently spent years searching the planet for Mogo, examining various plants and animals for any sign of a power ring, until closer examination of patterns in the foliage led him to realize just what Mogo really was, prompting him to flee Mogo in a panic. In one incident, it sent holograms to purchase Lobo's dolphins. When Lobo tried to retrieve them, a Mogo hologram persuaded him not to. The dolphins turned out to have a symbiotic relationship with Mogo, eating space debris that fell to his surface. Lobo never discovered he was dealing with a sentient planet.Mister Miracle #13-14 (March‚ÄìApril 1990) At the same time, Mogo has allowed alien races to live on its surface and has been willing to change its climatic conditions to suit them. These inhabitants of Mogo may not always know that their home is alive and watching them. When the Parallax entity, who was at that time inhabiting the body of Hal Jordan, destroyed the power battery on Oa and slew the Guardians, Mogo lost contact with the Green Lantern energy that helped sustain him. He traveled to Sector 1014 to seek the aid of Ch'p, unaware that his friend had died long ago. Having relied on the emerald energy of the power battery to sustain him, Mogo lost consciousness and drifted through Sector 1014 until he was discovered by a nomadic alien race. These aliens proceeded to strip Mogo of his natural resources and pollute his environment. Mogo's body reacted instinctively, creating constructs to hinder the aliens' efforts to exploit his resources. Mogo was finally rescued by Kyle Rayner, who used his power ring to reawaken the sleeping giant. Mogo offered to allow the aliens to settle on him and offered to take care of all their needs, but the stubborn beings chose to abandon their settlements. Mogo later revealed to Rayner that he was relieved the aliens had left, and that he had planned to give them terrible weather in retaliation for their pollution.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #158-159 (March‚ÄìApril 2003) This storyline contradicts a Green Lantern annual where Kyle faces the bodies of many dead Green Lanterns, Mogo included, all of whom try to destroy him.Green Lantern Annual (vol. 3) #7 (1998) Mogo appeared in Green Lantern Corps: Recharge #2, requesting back-up against Rannian and Thanagarian forces. Green Lanterns Kyle Rayner, Guy Gardner, Stel, and Green Man were dispatched to clear out the enemy fleets and then enjoyed a respite on Mogo's surface (Guy made metafictional remarks about Mogo wanting to socialize, recalling the famous Alan Moore story). With the restoration of the Green Lantern Corps, Mogo has taken on the role of a training and recreation planet for his fellow Green Lanterns. Soranik Natu, Kyle Rayner, and other Lanterns have traveled to his sector to ask for his counsel. Further, while defending Mogo from an attack by the Sinestro Corps, the Green Lantern Arisia explained that Mogo is responsible for guiding Lantern power rings without users to those who can overcome great fear, and says that \\"without him, the rings are directionless\\".Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #15 (October 2007) =Infinite Crisis= Mogo played a major role in the conclusion of the Infinite Crisis, in which the Green Lantern Corps, Superman and Kal-L stop the villainous Superboy-Prime. The two Supermen flew the deluded Superboy-Prime through the red sun Rao in a desperate gamble to depower him. With their powers waning, the Kryptonians crash land on Mogo. Superboy-Prime is defeated by Superman, but Kal-L dies of his injuries. After the fight, the rest of the Green Lantern Corps, who have suffered fatalities themselves, take Superboy-Prime into custody.Infinite Crisis #7 (June 2006) In the '52' storyline, as Adam Strange and Starfire's ship is hurtling towards a sun, Mogo appears and rescues them.52 #41 (November 2007) =Prophecy= In Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual #2 (1986), a prophecy narrated to Abin Sur suggests that Mogo will be the last Green Lantern. In a battle with the \\"Empire of Tears\\", Ranx the Sentient City will explode a blink-bomb within Mogo's core, killing the sentient planet and ending the Green Lantern Corps forever. When the Corps is rebuilt again, many Lanterns gain partners. Mogo teams up with Bzzd, an insect-sized Lantern. Bzzd is killed battling Mongul II.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #26 (September 2008) In Green Lantern Corps #11 (vol. 2), Mogo apparently shows Kilowog images of his dead species, pushing him into madness and hatred toward the Green Lantern Corps. He then starts tampering with the minds of the Lanterns seeking advice and counseling in the form of illusions granted by Mogo's powers, framing Guy Gardner for killing and pitting the Lanterns against each other. This behavior seems to be caused by the virus Despotellis of the Sinestro Corps and, according to Guy Gardner, was actually unnoticed by the planet, who was immune to the fungus himself (stated by Green Man in issue #13). After the fungus made itself known by drilling towards Mogo's core, the sentient planet proceeded to shift its orbit into the path of an asteroid whose impact noticeably scars Mogo but eradicates the fungus, whose remnants are destroyed by the other Lanterns. The Sinestro Corps attack Mogo with Ranx, who started to drill into the planet, with the intention of planting the blink bomb. It was revealed that Mogo is the one who guides the rings of deceased Lanterns to find new replacements and that if he should die, the Corps would be unable to recruit members in this manner. Thanks to Sodam Yat, as well as a change in the Book of Oa permitting the Lanterns to use lethal force against the Sinestro Corps, Ranx is destroyed and the Sinestro Corps are driven from Mogo.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #16 (November 2007) =Blackest Night= During the Blackest Night event, Oa is attacked by the deadly Black Lantern Corps.Blackest Night #1 (September 2009) During the attack, Salaak decrees that all rings from fallen Green Lanterns should be sent to Mogo, so as not to endanger the lives of potential rookies.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #40 (November 2009) Soranik Natu then sends all injured patients from the fight to Mogo, but is sidetracked by Kyle Rayner being attacked by a Black Lantern Jade. She sends her partner Iolande to Mogo with the patients alone instead.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #41 (December 2009) Mogo shows up at Oa to help in the battle against the Black Lanterns with Kilowog stating \\"I guess Mogo does socialize after all\\", a tip of the hat to Moore's origin story.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #43 (February 2010) Mogo increases his gravity to such a degree that all of the Black Lanterns are pulled down to his surface and absorbed into his core. The superhot magma within continually burns up the Black Lantern's bodies, keeping them from regenerating their forms. Mogo describes this as \\"They will burn, for all eternity\\". The injured patients are shown to be resting safely on Mogo.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #44 (March 2010) Following the successful imprisonment and destruction of the Black Lanterns, Mogo and the rest of the Green Lantern Corps along with Munk and Miri face the wrath of a red ring‚Äìpossessed Guy Gardner. While Miri, a Star Sapphire, attempts to revert Guy to normal, it is ultimately Mogo who manages to purge the infection of the red light. However, he warns that some influence of the red still remains and that only a Blue Lantern's power ring could completely remove the influence of the red ring. Mogo soon resumes his duties of supervising new rookies as they are recruited.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #45 (April 2010) =War of the Green Lanterns= In the War of the Green Lanterns crossover, Mogo was corrupted and taken over when Krona attacked Oa with the emotional entities and Parallax climbed inside the Central Power Battery on Oa.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #59 (April 2011) Krona then used Mogo to send out hundreds of Green Lantern rings across the universe to recruit more members to be brainwashed. Kyle Rayner and John Stewart tried to stop Mogo while wielding blue and indigo rings respectively, but they could not reach him because of the Black Lantern energy that Mogo had absorbed from the events of \\"Blackest Night\\". John Stewart used his Indigo Tribe ring to absorb the Black Lantern energy, and was forced to destroy Mogo by firing a Black Lantern constructed bullet into his core.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #60 (May 2011) Mogo's sudden destruction caused fragments of his body to rain down upon Oa, destroying multiple structures and knocking out many rogue Lanterns under Krona's control, leaving an opening for Hal and Guy to get to Krona almost unimpeded. After Krona is apparently killed by Hal Jordan, Mogo's corpse is now orbiting around the planet Oa.War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath #1 (July 2011) After the ensuing chaos, along with Krona's death and Sinestro gaining a green ring, Kilowog states that as long as Mogo's corpse floats above Oa, the Corps will be disheartened. He gets numerous Lanterns together and they move his pieces into the nearest sun, giving him a \\"funeral pyre\\". The resulting reaction from Mogo's body being put into the sun causes a Mogo-like Green Lantern stripe to appear, forever honoring the planet.War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath #2 (August 2011) =The New 52= Following Mogo's destruction, the Guardians tell John Stewart that Mogo's remains appear to be moving toward a particular location, suggesting that Mogo is trying to reform. The Guardians assign Stewart to track it.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 3) #13 (October 2012) While traveling, he encounters Fatality,Green Lantern Corps (vol. 3) #14 (November 2012) who reveals that Mogo is actually a male and female consciousness that were 'mated' at the core, with John's fragment of Mogo containing the female consciousness that seeks to be reunited with its mate. This prompts Fatality to use her Star Sapphire powers to help the endangered love come together.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 3) #15 (December 2012) John and Fatality arrive at the location of Mogo's pieces. They are held prisoner by a space pirate using Mogo's power as the ship's energy beam weapon to attack the planet's core, threatening their lives. John and Fatality attack the space pirate, intending to free Mogo, by sending the space pirate to crash on the planet. John discovers the Guardians' plan to use Mogo.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 3) #16 (January 2013) After the events of \\"War of the Green Lanterns\\", Mogo reforms into a planet's orbit. The Guardians reveal their plan was to use the size of the reconstituted Mogo and assimilate it into the Third Army, but the plan fails when Mogo destroys the Third Army trying to assimilate it.Green Lantern Corps Annual (vol. 3) #1 (January 2013) The villainous First Lantern drained the Green Lantern Corps of their emotions on the planet Oa, but Mogo rescued the Corps by shielding them with dirt and stone, allowing them to escape from the First Lantern's powers. When the Green Lantern Corps are transported to Mogo, Mogo creates a scenario in which the Corps is attacked by their doppelgangers. Mogo freezes the doppelgangers and confesses the ruse to the Corps, stating that it was done to test their will and strength and prepare them to fight against the First Lantern.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 3) #19 (April 2013) After the Lights Out crossover and the destruction by Relic, Mogo became the new headquarters of the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern Corps (vol.3) #24 (Dec. 2013) Mogo's ring is later stolen by the forces of New Genesis. This causes Mogo's rotation to slow and its systems to crumble. Several Green Lanterns perish in an attempt to rescue Mogo's ring.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #35 (October 2014) Following the final battle at New Genesis, Mogo is restored when his ring is returned.Green Lantern (vol. 5) Annual #3 =Future= In the Legion of 3 Worlds, it is revealed that in the 31st century Mogo has been long dead and without him, there was no way to distribute the rings and thus no Green Lantern Corps.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #2 (October 2008) =DC Universe= Mogo appears in DC Rebirth and the post-Rebirth DC Universe. In Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #1, after the events where the Green Lantern Corps found themselves displaced in another universe, Mogo and the other surviving members of the corps find their way back home to their own universe.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #1 (September 2016). Thereafter, Mogo also serves as the current headquarters of the Green Lantern Corps.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #2‚Äì50 (October 2016 ‚Äì October 2018). For a period, during the \\"Prism of Time\\" and \\"Fracture\\" story arcs of Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps, Mogo also served as the joint headquarters of the Green Lantern Corps (under the leadership of John Stewart) and the Sinestro Corps (under the leadership of Soranik Natu).Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #18-25 (June‚ÄìSeptember 2017). During the time that Hank Henshaw was hacking into the Green Lantern main Power Battery, he corrupted Mogo's landscape causing uncontrolled weather and for numerous buildings to collapse.Green Lanterns #50-56 (July-September 2018) Following Henshaw's defeat, Ganthet reveals the Guardians are secretly rebuilding Oa and intend to return the Green Lanterns' main base of operations back there to allow for Mogo to fully recover from this experienceGreen Lanterns #57 (October 2018) Powers and abilities In addition to the standard powers of a Green Lantern power ring, Mogo can also alter his weather and surface conditions such as plant growth and gravity, and travel through space at faster-than-light speeds. Mogo has a form of sensory or extrasensory awareness of what is happening around and on it. However, his wellbeing is largely sustained by the constant supply of energy from a Green Lantern power battery. Without it, he eventually loses his strength and even falls into a seemingly comatose state. Mogo also telepathically guided the Green Lantern power rings to their bearers. Other versions =Green Lantern versus Aliens= In the Green Lantern versus Aliens limited series, Mogo was also the adopted home of a group of Aliens. It seems that years ago, Hal Jordan and a group of fellow Green Lanterns were charged with dealing with these Xenomorphs following the death of a Green Lantern, and Hal Jordan wanted to avoid killing them if possible, believing that they were just animals and thus were not evil. His solution was to deposit them on Mogo, where they would be a threat to no one and would be able to live. Years after that, however, Kyle Rayner and other Green Lanterns, including Salaak traveled to Mogo to rescue the crew of a crashed freighter. This was Rayner's first encounter with the sentient planet, although he didn't speak to Mogo directly. Most of the GL squad did not survive. However, due to its non-canon nature (as evidenced by the dead GLs showing up alive later), in their next encounter, Rayner does not remember this event. =Injustice: Gods Among Us= In the Injustice: Gods Among Us comic, Mogo arrives near Earth along with rest of the Green Lanterns to combat Superman's regime and the Sinestro Corps, killing many Sinestro Corps members in the ensuing battle. However, Batman's plan to stream Superman's brutality backfired, as he becomes even more powerful after receiving a yellow power ring and seemingly killing Black Canary, terrifying the entire Earth. Superman confronts and overpowers Ganthet, slamming him into Mogo while withstanding the latter's planetary green energy beam. Finally, he pushes both of them into the sun. In other media =Television= Mogo appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Eyes of Despero\\". Despero takes control of Mogo as part of his plan. It is later freed by G'nort. Here, Mogo exhibits an increased control of its land mass. * Mogo appears in the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode \\"Lost Planet\\", voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. It appears as a stowaway planet that has caused numerous ships from throughout the universe to crash onto himself so that he could imprison the criminals on board the fleets to keep them from harming others. This incarnation gets his power from a power ring at his core, and emits a massive construct of a power ring around its equator, giving the planet the appearance of \\"wearing\\" the ring. In the first half of the series, Mogo helped guide Saint Walker to finding the Blue Lantern battery. They then went to assist Kilowog against the Red Lantern armada attempting to intrude into Guardian space. When the Red Lantern mothership Shard fired planet-killing Liberators at Mogo, the living planet transferred all his power to Saint Walker who amplified it to destroy the entire armada. =Film= Mogo appears in the movie Green Lantern: Emerald Knights. He first appears in a flashback story told by Hal Jordan which is an adaptation of his premiere story. At the climax of the film, Mogo arrives to help his comrades defeat Krona, and since that involves sacrificing the evacuated planet Oa, he volunteers his own body for the Corps' temporary headquarters afterward. * Although Mogo appeared in promotional material for the 2011 Green Lantern film, this character does not make an appearance in the film. =Video games= Mogo appears in DC Universe Online. He is seen in the \\"War of the Light\\" Pt. 1 DLC fighting Ranx the Sentient City in the sky. * Mogo is mentioned in Injustice 2 by Brainiac and Green Lantern, who note that he is deceased.

Thompson's rise to fame in the 1970s and his relationship with Chicano attorney and activist Oscar \\"Zeta\\" Acosta. The film was produced and directed by Art Linson. Bill Murray portrayed the author and Peter Boyle portrayed Acosta, who is referred to in the film as Carl Lazlo, Esq. A number of other names, places, and details of Thompson's life are also changed. Thompson's eulogy for Acosta, \\"The Banshee Screams for Buffalo Meat\\", which appeared in Rolling Stone in October 1977, serves as the basis of the film, although screenwriter John Kaye drew from several other works, including Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72, The Great Shark Hunt, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Thompson served as \\"executive consultant\\" on the film. Plot The film opens in the Rocky Mountains on the Colorado ranch of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, a journalist furiously trying to finish a story about his former attorney and friend, Carl Lazlo, Esq. Thompson then flashes back to a series of exploits involving the author and his attorney. In 1968, Lazlo is fighting to stop a group of San Francisco youngsters from receiving harsh prison sentences for possession of marijuana. He convinces Thompson to write an article about it for Blast Magazine. Thompson's editor, Marty Lewis, reminds Thompson that he has 19 hours to deadline. The judge hands out stiff sentences to everyone; the last client is a young man who was caught with a pound of marijuana and receives a five-year sentence. Lazlo reacts by attacking the prosecuting attorney and is then jailed for contempt of court. The magazine story about the trial is a sensation, but Thompson does not hear from Lazlo until four years later, when Thompson is on assignment covering Super Bowl VI in Los Angeles.Super Bowl VI was actually played in New Orleans, Louisiana. Lazlo appears at Thompson's hotel and convinces him to abandon the Super Bowl story and join his band of freedom fighters, which involves smuggling weapons to an unnamed Latin American country. Thompson goes along with Lazlo and the revolutionaries to a remote airstrip where a small airplane is to be loaded with weapons, but when a police helicopter finds them, Lazlo and his henchmen escape on the plane while Thompson refuses to follow. Thompson's fame and fortune continue. He is a hit on the college lecture circuit and covers the 1972 presidential election campaign. After being thrown off the journalist plane by The Candidate's press secretary, Thompson takes the crew plane and gives strait-laced journalist Harris from the Post a strong hallucinogenic drug and steals his clothes and press credentials. At the next campaign stop, in the airport bathroom, Thompson is able to use his disguise to engage The Candidate in a conversation about the \\"Screwheads\\" and the \\"Doomed\\". Thompson, still posing as Harris, returns to the journalist plane. Lazlo then appears, striding across the airport tarmac in a white suit. He boards the plane and tries to convince his old friend to join his socialist paradise somewhere in the desert. After causing a disturbance, Thompson and Lazlo are thrown off the plane, and Lazlo's papers that describe the community are blown across the airport runway. Lazlo, presumably, is not heard from again. The action then returns to Thompson's cabin, just as the writer puts the finishing touches on his story, explaining that he didn't go along with Lazlo‚Äîor Nixon‚Äîbecause \\"it still hasn't gotten weird enough for me.\\" Cast Bill Murray as Hunter S. Thompson * Peter Boyle as Carl Lazlo, Esq. * Bruno Kirby as Marty Lewis * Ren√© Auberjonois as Harris from The Washington Post * R.G. Armstrong as Judge Simpson * Mark Metcalf as Dooley * Craig T. Nelson as Cop on Stand * Brian Cummings as Richard M. Nixon Production In the late 1970s, film producer Thom Mount paid US$100,000 for the film rights to the obituary of Chicano activist Oscar Zeta Acosta, \\"The Banshee Screams for Buffalo Meat\\", written by Hunter S. Thompson. Thompson agreed to have it optioned without seeing a screenplay figuring that the film would never get made, as the vastly more popular Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas had been optioned several times and was never made. In 1978, Art Linson, who had previously produced four films, started planning to make the film, which would be his directorial debut. Thompson remembered, \\"Then all of a sudden there was some moment of terrible horror when I realized they were going to make the movie\\". Linson asked illustrator Ralph Steadman to create a poster for the film in the style of the illustrations he had done for Thompson's articles. He used a drawing titled Spirit of Gonzo as the basis. Thompson met with the film's screenwriter John Kaye and felt that Kaye understood more than what was in the script, which he described as \\"bad, dumb, low-level, low rent\\". Thompson admitted that he signed away having any kind of control so that he could not be blamed for the end result. In the original script, Lazlo's surname was Mendoza but this was changed after Nosotros, a group of Chicano actors and filmmakers, threatened to create controversy if the character was played by Anglo actor Peter Boyle. Just before principal photography was to begin, Bill Murray became apprehensive about the project because of the shortcomings of the script. Before principal photography began, Linson took a four-month crash course in directing. Thompson was eventually brought aboard the film's production as \\"executive consultant\\", but claimed he had no substantial role other than to have \\"wandered around and fired machine guns on the set\\". Kaye has claimed that Thompson and Murray changed parts of the script during filming and, at that point, he chose to no longer be involved in the production. Steadman observed Linson on the set and said that it was \\"pretty obvious that he was in no frame of mind to catch the abandoned pure essence of gonzo madness, which can only happen in uncontrolled conditions\\". He also felt that Linson's \\"fanaticism for the subject he was trying to portray was undoubtedly there, and his sincerity, too\\", but felt that he was under the impression that the film was a runaway hit before he had even begun filming it and therefore refused to take any chances with the material. Steadman and Thompson spent time on the set and the former talked to Murray about his impressions and observations of the latter's mannerisms. Within two weeks of Thompson being on set, Murray had transformed into him. During production, Murray and Thompson engaged in a series of dangerous one-upmanship contests. \\"One day at Thompson's Aspen, Colorado home, after many drinks and after much arguing over who could out-Houdini whom, Thompson tied Billy to a chair and threw him into the swimming pool. Billy nearly drowned before Thompson pulled him out.\\" Murray immersed himself in the character so deeply that when Saturday Night Live started its fifth season, Murray was still in character as Thompson. \\"In a classic case of the role overtaking the actor, Billy returned that fall to Saturday Night so immersed in playing Hunter Thompson he had virtually become Hunter Thompson, complete with long black cigarette holder, dark glasses, and nasty habits. 'Billy,' said one of the writers, echoing several others, 'was not Bill Murray, he was Hunter Thompson. You couldn't talk to him without talking to Hunter Thompson.'\\" Murray and Thompson were concerned with the film's lack of continuity and in early 1980 added voice-over narration. When the film was sneak-previewed in late March, the last two scenes and narration were absent. Murray was outraged and the studio ended up shooting a new ending. Three days before it was to be released in theaters a press screening was suddenly canceled because of editing problems. The film shows Thompson in Los Angeles covering 1972's Super Bowl VI between the Miami Dolphins and the Dallas Cowboys. That game was actually played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans. (The next year's Super Bowl was played in Los Angeles, between the Dolphins and the Washington Redskins.) Reception The film opened on April 25, 1980 in 464 theaters, earning $1,750,593 in its opening weekend and more than $6.6 million for a total lifetime gross. It has been panned critically for being a series of bizarre episodes strung together rather than having a cohesive central plot. Movie historian Leonard Maltin remarked that \\"Even Neil Young's music score can't save this dreadful comedy, which will baffle those who aren't familiar with Hunter S. Thompson's work and insult those who are.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert gave Where the Buffalo Roam two stars out of four and said that \\"The movie fails to deal convincingly with either Thompson's addictions or with his friendship with Lazlo\\". However, Ebert also noted that \\"this is the kind of bad movie that's almost worth seeing\\". Gene Siskel awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four and declared that \\"Murray is fine at playing an angry clown, but 'Where the Buffalo Roam' should have given us much more than that. There's nothing in the film that would make anyone want to read Hunter Thompson's words. And that's a critical failure for a movie about a writer.\\"Siskel, Gene (April 25, 1980). \\"'Buffalo' roams way too far into slapstick territory\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 3. In his review for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold wrote, \\"Well, the actors haven't transcended their material. They're simply stuck with it. Murray and Boyle don't emerge as a swell comic team, and they aren't funny as individuals either.\\" Jack Kroll wrote, in his review for Newsweek magazine, \\"Screenwriter John Kaye has reduced Thompson's career to a rubble of disjointed episodes, and the relentless mayhem becomes tiresome chaos rather than liberating comic anarchy.\\" In his review for The Globe and Mail, Paul McGrath wrote, \\"Murray is, nonetheless, the salvation of this patched-together film\\", and felt that \\"the rest is mostly filler. The story is so badly put together in the first place - and from there, badly scripted - that the movie makes almost no impact outside the infrequent hilarity\\". Roger Angell of The New Yorker wrote, \\"The most surprising thing ... is how much of Thompson's tone gets into the picture\\". The film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes lists the film as \\"rotten\\" with a 17% favorable rating among critics based on 24 reviews. Universal Studios quickly pulled it from distribution. Thompson hated the film, saying he liked Murray's performance but that he \\"was very disappointed in the script. It sucks ‚Äì a bad, dumb, low- level, low-rent script.\\" Years later, Murray reflected on the film, \\"I rented a house in L.A. with a guest house that Hunter lived in. I'd work all day and stay up all night with him; I was strong in those days. I took on another persona and that was tough to shake. I still have Hunter in me\\". Soundtrack The film was scored by Neil Young, who sings the opening theme, \\"Home on the Range\\" (from which the film derives its title), accompanied by a harmonica. Variations on \\"Home on the Range\\" are played by Young on electric guitar as \\"Ode to Wild Bill\\" and by an orchestra with arrangements by David Blumberg on \\"Buffalo Stomp\\". Music in the film included rock and R&B; songs by Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Temptations, the Four Tops and Creedence Clearwater Revival. Additionally, characters played by Bill Murray and Ren√© Auberjonois sing lyrics from \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\". Because of the high cost of music licensing, most VHS and all DVD releases retained only the Neil Young score and the Creedence song \\"Keep on Chooglin'\\", with the rest of the music replaced by generic approximations of the original songs. The choice of songs for the DVD version was somewhat anachronistic, featuring 1980s-style songs in a 1960s and 1970s setting. In 2017, Shout! Factory released a Blu-ray edition restoring the original songs, making this the first home media version since the original VHS release to feature a completely unaltered soundtrack. The soundtrack album was released by Backstreet Records in 1980 as a vinyl LP and included pieces of dialogue from the film. It has not been re-issued on CD.

His book The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe (2014)http://www.davidkertzer.com/books/pope-and-mussolini won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Career and writing Kertzer graduated from Brown University in 1969. He received his PhD in Anthropology from Brandeis University in 1974, and taught at Bowdoin College until 1992. That year he joined the faculty of Brown University as Professor of Anthropology and History. Sponsored by the U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission, in 1978 he was Senior Lecturer at the University of Catania and in 2000, Chair at the University of Bologna. In 2001, he relinquished his post at Brown as Professor of History and was appointed Professor of Italian Studies. In 2005, he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. From July 1, 2006, to June 30, 2011, Kertzer served as Provost at Brown.Kertzer CV Kertzer is the author of numerous books and articles on politics and culture, European social history, anthropological demography, 19th-century Italian social history, contemporary Italian society and politics, and the history of Vatican relations with the Jews and the Italian state. His book, The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara, was a finalist for the National Book Award in Nonfiction in 1997. His The Popes Against the Jews, published in 2001, was subsequently described as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed and contentious books of its genre and generation.\\" The book analyzes the relation between the development of the Catholic Church and the growth of European anti-Semitism in the 19th and 20th centuries, arguing that the Vatican and several popes contributed actively to fertilizing the ideological ground that produced the Holocaust. The work produced intense discussion among scholars of European history and historians of the Catholic Church. The follow-up work, The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe (2014), examined documentary evidence from the Vatican archives, arguing that Pope Pius XI played a significant role in supporting the rise of Fascism and Benito Mussolini in Italy, but not of Nazi Germany. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography in April 2015.

She has been called \\"the finest Australian writer of her generation\\". For her career contribution to \\"children's and young adult literature in the broadest sense\\" Hartnett won the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award from the Swedish Arts Council in 2008, the biggest prize in children's literature. She has published books as Sonya Hartnett, S. L. Hartnett, and Cameron S. Redfern. Writer Hartnett was born in Box Hill, Victoria. She was thirteen years old when she wrote her first novel and fifteen when it was published for the adult market in Australia, Trouble All the Way (Adelaide: Rigby Publishers, 1984).It has been classified as Juvenile Fiction by some libraries. . Retrieved 3 June 2013. For years she has written about one novel annually. Although she is often classified as a writer of young adult fiction, Hartnett does not consider this label entirely accurate: \\"I've been perceived as a young adult writer whereas my books have never really been young adult novels in the sort of classic sense of the idea.\\" She believes the distinction is not so important in Britain as in her native land.\\"Sonya Hartnett: London, 2002\\" (interview, part 1 of 5). ACHUKA (achuka.co.uk). 2002. According to the National Library of Australia, \\"The novel for which Hartnett has achieved the most critical (and controversial) acclaim was Sleeping Dogs\\" (1995). \\"A book involving incest between brother and sister and often critiqued as 'without hope', Sleeping Dogs generated enormous discussion both within Australia and overseas.\\" Many of Hartnett's books have been published in the UK and in North America. For Thursday's Child (2000, UK 2002), she won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once- in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers. In 2008 she won the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award which is administered by the Swedish Arts Council. Landscape with Animals controversy In 2006, Hartnett was involved with some controversy regarding the publication of Landscape with Animals, published under the pseudonym Cameron S. Redfern. The book contains many sex scenes and Hartnett was almost immediately \\"outed\\" as the author. She said that she wanted to avoid the book being accidentally shelved with her work for children in libraries and denied that she used a pseudonym to evade responsibility for the work or as a publicity stunt √† la Nikki Gemmell's The Bride Stripped Bare. In a review published in The Age, Peter Craven savaged the book describing it as an \\"overblown little sex shocker\\", a \\"tawdry little crotch tickler\\" and lamented that Hartnett was \\"too good a writer to put her name to this indigestible hairball of spunk and spite\\". It was defended vigorously in The Australian by Marion Halligan (\\"I haven't read many books by Hartnett, but I think this is a much more amazing piece of writing than any of them\\") who chastised Craven for missing the joke (\\"How could an experienced critic get that so wrong?\\") and wonders why female authors writing frankly about sex is so frowned upon.Marion Halligan (24 June 2006). \\"Sex and the singular woman\\".

This ship was named for Chief Water Tender Oscar V. Peterson (1899‚Äì1942), who was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions during the Battle of the Coral Sea. Peterson was laid down 28 February 1943 by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Orange, Texas; launched 15 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Lola B. Peterson; and commissioned 29 September 1943, Lieutenant Commander Richard F. Rea, USCG, in command.  World War II service  Peterson moved to Galveston, Texas, 6 October 1943 to continue her outfitting, then sailed by way of Algiers, Louisiana to Bermuda for shakedown. She reported to Charleston, South Carolina, for a brief post-shakedown upkeep 22 November, and six days later was en route to New York City, arriving the last day of the month. Her first voyage between New York and Casablanca, French Morocco, commenced 2 December when Peterson sailed for Norfolk, Virginia to join the main body of a North Africa bound convoy. She returned to New York 18 January 1944. Peterson then shifted her activity to Northern Europe, making ten voyages to British and French ports. On the first of these voyages, Peterson with the other escorts of Division 22 steamed from New York 1 March to screen a fast oiler convoy to Derry, Northern Ireland. On this voyage a submarine sank Leopold (DE-319). Peterson arrived with the convoy at Derry and returned to New York 28 March where she was joined by . Departing New York 15 April with an Ireland bound convoy, Peterson was detached the following day to escort two merchant ships, which had collided, back to New York. En route to rejoin the convoy later on the same day, Peterson joined Gandy and in rescuing survivors of the torpedoed Pan Pennsylvania and destroying the attacker. At 13:45 Joyce reported a hot sound contact and the last survivors scrambled on board Peterson just as Joyce dropped a pattern of depth charges. The submarine shot to the surface at 14:00. Gandy opened fire on the U-boat which returned fire until rammed with a glancing blow by Gandy two minutes later. Peterson commenced firing at 14:04 to lay open the conning tower, and as she passed alongside the submarine, fired two shallow-set depth charges at close range from her starboard \\"K\\" guns. At 1409 the submarine surrendered and the crew commenced abandoning the sinking boat. Joyce picked up the crew and slid beneath the waves at 14:30. The three escorts rejoined the convoy and steamed safely to Lisahally, Northern Ireland, returning to New York 12 May 1944. The sunken German U-boat was found on 23 July 2012 in deep water about south of Nantucket, Massachusetts. USS Peterson (DE-152) Peterson made three more convoy voyages to Derry and return. She then made successive voyages from New York to Plymouth, England (6 October‚Äì5 November 1944); from New York to Cherbourg, France and Plymouth, England (23 November ‚Äì 24 December); from New York to Liverpool, England (10 January‚Äì9 February 1945); from New York to Le Havre, France and Southampton, England (27 February ‚Äì 29 March); and from Boston to Greenock, Scotland and Liverpool, England, returning to New York 16 April. After an overhaul to fit her for extended duty in the Pacific, Peterson departed New York 4 June 1945 with the rest of Escort Division 22 for exercises at Culebra Island, and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She transited the Panama Canal 23 June, called at San Diego for voyage repairs, and arrived Pearl Harbor 16 July. With the end of the war, she reported to Commander Amphibious Group 8 and Commander Transport Squadron 18 for duty. Peterson departed Pearl Harbor the last day of August 1945 with an LST convoy. Calling at Saipan en route, the convoy arrived off Wakayama, Japan, 27 September and Peterson assumed patrol in the Inland Sea until 29 October. On that day she set course for the United States, calling at Pearl Harbor, and arriving San Diego 17 November. She shifted to San Pedro the following day. She got underway for the east coast, transiting the Panama Canal 6 December. Three days later off the coast of Florida, a PBM‚Äì3D (Mariner) landed close aboard to ask assistance. Peterson towed the disabled plane to Ponce de Leon Inlet where a crash boat from New Smyrna took over the tow. She then continued up the coast to Charleston, South Carolina, arriving 10 December 1945. Peterson sailed for Jacksonville, Florida, 14 January 1946, arriving the following day to commence her inactivation. She was placed out of commission in reserve at Green Cove Springs, Florida, 1 May 1946. During her first period of commissioning, Peterson was manned by a U.S. Coast Guard crew. During her second commissioning period, she was manned by a U.S. Navy crew.  Post-war service  Peterson recommissioned in the Boston Naval Shipyard, 2 May 1952, Lt. Comdr. Kay S. Irwin in command. Peterson spent the next five years operating with Escort Squadron 10 off the east coast of the United States, from Newport, Rhode Island, to Key West, Florida, and in the Caribbean Sea. During these years she saw considerable duty as Fleet Sonar Schoolship at Key West. In July 1953 she visited Bergen, Norway, and Copenhagen, Denmark. In October 1954 she conducted simulated convoy escort exercises to waters off Hamilton Inlet, Labrador. In July 1955 she cruised to Edinburgh, Scotland, and Copenhagen. In May 1957 while in the Caribbean she tracked Jupiter missiles fired from Cape Canaveral and in August played a vital role in the first successful recovery of a missile nose cone, attaching a buoy-float to the nose cone flotation unit. Peterson put to sea 3 September 1957 with fifteen other warships and eleven auxiliary vessels of Task Force 88.1, bound for Portland, England. She reached Portland 14 September and was underway the next day for strenuous North Atlantic Treaty Organization maneuvers. She conducted independent reconnaissance patrol off Sweden until 19 September when she was joined by Huse (DE-145), two Canadian destroyers and a Dutch cruiser, for patrol off southern Sweden, and then to Frederikshaven, Denmark, where she arrived 23 September. She departed that port in company with Huse the next day for maneuvers in the North Sea and reached Le Havre, France, 30 September. After a visit to Dunkirk, France, she returned to Newport 21 October. Peterson became a unit of the newly created Destroyer Escort Squadron Twelve 1 November and arrived at Key West 24 November for another tour of service as schoolship for the Fleet Sonar School. She departed Key West 23 January 1958 for a Caribbean training cruise with her squadron. In May Peterson assisted in the first recovery of a full-size missile nose cone that had penetrated the atmosphere. She resumed her Fleet Sonar schoolship duty at Key West 22 May 1958 and got underway 8 August for competitive exercises off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She arrived Kingston, Jamaica 14 August 1958 and put to sea within fifteen hours on an emergency mercy mission to deliver badly needed water to a rescue tug tending a Greek freighter aground about 150 miles south of Kingston. Peterson resumed schoolship duties at Key West 18 August 1958 and put to sea 3 January 1959 for waters off the north coast of Cuba, standing by with other ships of her task group in the event American citizens in Havana might need her protection. She returned to Key West 6 January and continued services for the Fleet Sonar School. She departed 24 August to participate in \\"Operation Deep Freeze 60.\\" She passed through the Panama Canal and arrived Dunedin, New Zealand, 22 September. A unit of Task Force 43, she got underway six days later and steamed to Ocean Weather Station (latitude 60 degrees south; longitude 170 degrees east). On that station midway between Antarctica and New Zealand, she acted as a weather communications and rescue ship for supply flights from Christchurch to the southernmost continent. Peterson, circa 1964. From July 1961 to December 1963 Peterson served principally as a training ship for students of the U.S. Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida. In April 1962 she visited Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Jamaica. During the second half of 1962 Peterson was a movie star, playing the role of the Japanese destroyer that rammed and sank PT‚Äì109. On 22 October 1962 Peterson suddenly found herself on a full war-time footing and bound full speed for quarantine duty off the Cuban coast during the Cuban Missile Crisis. She was ordered home in time for Christmas. Peterson visited Guantanamo Bay for training in January and July 1963. January 1964 found Peterson patrolling the coasts of Colombia and Venezuela. She returned to Key West 23 February. For the balance of the year she operated out of Key West, mainly as Fleet Sonar Schoolship. In June 1965 the Peterson was decommissioned for the last time in Norfolk, Virginia and was laid to rest in the inactive reserve fleet in Portsmouth, Virginia. Disposed of, sold by Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrapping, June 1974.  Awards  Peterson received one battle star for World War II service. During peace time she at one time held seven separate Battle Efficiency \\"E\\"s.

People in the field work toward developing an understanding of how the whole body responds to a food via systems biology, as well as single gene/single food compound relationships. Nutritional genomics or Nutrigenomics is the relation between food and inherited genes, it was first expressed in 2001.  Introduction  The term \\"nutritional genomics\\" is an umbrella term including several subcategories, such as nutrigentics, nutrigenomics, and nutritional epigenetics. Each of these subcategories explain some aspect of how genes react to nutrients and express specific phenotypes, like disease risk. There are several applications for nutritional genomics, for example how much nutritional intervention and therapy can the successfully used for disease prevention and treatment. Background and preventive health Nutritional science originally emerged as a field that studied individuals lacking certain nutrients and the subsequent effects, such as the disease scurvy which results from a lack of vitamin C. As other diseases closely related to diet (but not deficiency), such as obesity, became more prevalent, nutritional science expanded to cover these topics as well. Nutritional research typically focuses on preventative measure, trying to identify what nutrients or foods will raise or lower risks of diseases and damage to the human body. For example, Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome, a disease whose most distinguishing factor is insatiable appetite, has been specifically linked to an epigenetic pattern in which the paternal copy in the chromosomal region is erroneously deleted, and the maternal loci is inactivated by over methylation. Yet, although certain disorders may be linked to certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or other localized patterns, variation within a population may yield many more polymorphisms.Bisen, Prakash A.; Debnath, Mousumi; Prasad, Godavarthi B.K.S. (2010). Molecular Dianostics: Promises and Possibilities. Springer Science & Business Media. p. 26..  Applications  The applications of nutritional genomics are multiple. With personalized assessment some disorders (diabetes, metabolic syndrome) can be identified. Nutrigenomics can help with personalized health and nutrition intake by assessing individuals and make specific nutritional requirements. The focus is in the prevention and the correction of specific genetic disorders. Examples of genetic related disorders that improve with nutritional correction are obesity, Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus type 1. Genetic disorders that can often be prevented by proper nutritional intake of parents include Spina Bifida, Alcoholism and Phenylketouria. Coronary Heart Disease Genes tied to nutrition manifest themselves through the body's sensitivity to food. In studies about Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), there is a relationship between the disease and the presence of 2 alleles found at E and B apolipoprotein loci. These loci differences result in individualized reactions to the consumption of lipids. Some people experience increased weight gain and greater risk of CHD whereas others with different loci do not. Research has shown a direct correlation between the decrease risk of CHD and the decrease consumption of lipids across all populations. = Obesity = Obesity is one of the most widely studied topics in nutritional genomics. Due to genetic variations among individuals, each person could respond to diet differently. By exploring the interaction between dietary pattern and genetic factors, the field aims to suggest dietary changes that could prevent or reduce obesity. There appear to be some SNPs that make it more likely that a person will gain weight from a high fat diet; for people with AA genotype in the FTO gene showed a higher BMI compared those with TT genotype when having high fat or low carbohydrate dietary intake. The APO B SNP rs512535 is another diet- related variation; the A/G heterozygous genotype was found to have association with obesity (in terms of BMI and waist circumference) and for individuals with habitual high fat diet (>35% of energy intake), while individuals with GG homozygotes genotype are likely to have a higher BMI compared to AA allele carriers. However, this difference is not found in low fat consuming group (<35% of energy intake). = Phenylketonuria (PKU) = Phenylketonuria, otherwise known as PKU, is a uncommon autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that takes effect postpartum but the debilitating symptoms can be reversed with nutritional intervention.

The weekly series was published only in Mexico, non-stop and during 5 years, from 1986 to 1991 (#298). The comic is considered one of the first Mexican sci-fi super robot \\"manga\\" and is notable because of its once-per-week publication schedule, something uncommon at its time of release. Series summary Karmatron depicts the adventures of an extraterrestrial humanoid called Zacek (\\"White Star\\" in Maya language), emperor of the alien Zuyua people and also a Kundalini warrior that an ancient prophecy announced to be the one who could restore the balance between light and darkness in the universe. Zacek was the bearer of the powerful Kalpe-Om, a magical belt that allowed him to transform himself into Karmatron, a 300 feet tall armoured spiritual warrior. Karmatron defended good and peace in all the universe, constantly fighting the forces of dark emperor Asura of Metnal and his evil god, the Master of Shadows, with the help of his numerous friends and his Transformables, an army of giant transformers. Later on, he created smaller ones -like Magneto and Warp. The comic has been called a space opera by its author, though it also had certain elements of comedy, adventure, and fantasy. Plot Art from Karmatr√≥n y los Transformables #1 (1992 re-run) showing the nineties redesign of the titular character with prince Zacek at the bottom. Cover art by Oscar Gonz√°lez Loyo. The story starts millions of years ago, in a very distant place in the universe‚ÄîPlanet Zuyua‚Äîwhere Zacek lived peacefully as the youngest of two heirs to the Zuyuan throne. There, young Zacek learned advanced cybernetics as a career, and he often built robots, big and small, as a hobby. His father, emperor Canilek (Snakestar, in mayan) was the founder and leader of the Great Universal Alliance (a galactic United Nations of sorts) that opposed emperor Asura's militaristic campaign of universal conquest. In issue # 1, Asura's metnalian army invaded Planet Zuyua's capital city and forced the zuyuan people out of their own planet, as thousands of them were exterminated by emperor Asura's bloodthirsty occupation forces. In the middle of the attack, four giant robots programmed by Zacek to activate in case of peril suddenly burst into action, attacking Asura's soldiers and ships and wreaking havoc in the invading army. Enter the first of many Transformables (also known as Guerreros Estelares or Stellar Warriors): Titan, a robot/tank and the Transformables' leader; Aquarius, a robot/submarine; Stelaris, a speedy robot/spaceship and Unicorn, a robot/subterranean vehicle. These four unexpected robotic heroes helped the zuyuans to survive the invasion so they could plan their exodus to a safer planet. However, while zuyuan strategists planned an escape route from Planet Zuyua, emperor Canilek sent his two sons on a quest to seek the Planet of Eternity, a sacred, mystical place where spiritual warriors go to attempt to awake the Kundalini serpent that lived in Mount Meru, and thus gain the spiritual transcendence, wisdom, inner peace and power that comes with being a Kundalini. Canilek hoped that at least one of his sons became the prophetized Kundalini warrior who would defeat Asura and bring back peace to the universe. Unfortunately, Canilek's best friend and advisor, Aspier, was also a spy who informed emperor Asura of Canilek's plans. Aspier was also commanded by Asura to kill Canilek when the appropriate time came, which he gleefully did, helped by the turmoil of Asura's invasion. Meanwhile, Zacek and his older brother Nazul arrived at the Planet of Eternity, but as they reached the sacred serpent's chamber located in the depths of Mount Meru, a metnalian soldier who followed them by Asura's command assaulted the two princes (Asura knew of the prophecy of the Kundalini that would defeat him) and managed to grab Nazul and take him to his ship before he could go into the serpent's resting place. Zacek was unable to help his brother, because the heavy slab of stone that guarded the serpent's chamber entrance slammed shut in that precise moment, trapping him in there. A voice in the chamber told Zacek that he had no other choice than to follow his father's wishes and attempt to awake the Kundalini Serpent, which he reluctantly did. The zuyuan prince underwent the difficult task of awakening the sacred serpent, a feat that only the most spiritually enlightened and pure of heart could accomplish. Zacek managed to succeed in his mission, and became a full-fledged Kundalini warrior. Katnatek, the first Kundalini warrior (and the voice he heard when he entered the chamber) appeared before him then and gave him his Kalpe-Om, the magical item that allowed him to transform in the most powerful warrior of good in this universe (the audience is later informed that there are many possible universes, and each possible universe has its own Karmatron). By uttering a sacred mantra, Zacek transformed into Karmatron for the first time. Fully equipped with his powerful new armor, Karmatron rushed then to Planet Metnal to save his brother, but he arrived too late. Emperor Asura tortured Nazul at his leisure, and then the dark emperor dumped him into Metnal's dreaded Darkness Zone, a place full of twisted, voracious man-eating beasts. Karmatron arrived at the Darkness Zone only to find the mangled corpse of Nazul still being devoured by the monsters who dwelled there. He also discovered that the evil emanations that impregnated the entire planet Metnal were very noxious to him (actually, evil in general was very noxious to him, because he used good spiritual power to fuel his powers) so he could only managed to escape rapidly from that horrid place with his brother's remains in his hands. Asura caught a glimpse of this awesome steel giant that came to his planet, and he became violently enraged then, for he acknowledge him for what he was, and knew him to be the source of many future problems. The comic book followed Zacek's further adventures as he battled Asura across the galaxies, through many millennia, and the story was interrupted abruptly in issue # 298, with Karmatron fighting Asura here on Earth in modern times. The comic book was discontinued then and fans of all ages still hope for the saga to start anew. The lost continent of Mu is featured as the location of one of the base cities of some of the main characters. The Moai of Easter Island are said to be images of a robot called Pazkuash, protector of Mu. Likewise, the ancient Olmec and Toltec statues and artifacts like the Olmec colossal heads and the Atlantean figures are -according to the plot- actually representations of the transformers Olmec and Toltec respectively. Karmatron's powers Zacek, as all Kundalini Warriors, can manipulate prana energy to create various effects: He can teleport short distances; he has some degree of telekinetic talent; he can read minds and thoughts; he can use clairvoyance; he can read the psychic imprints on an object; he can turn invisible; he can fire bolts of positive spiritual energy (and he can make weapons out of this energy, such as shurikens or boomerangs) and he can make astral journeys, leaving his body behind him. All Kundalini Warriors can stop their heartbeats completely in order to fool their enemies, or to avoid the effects of a lethal poison or radiation. This faked death is pretty convincing, as the warrior's body has effectively stopped functioning, but this is a very dangerous feat to perform. Kundalini Warriors can only do this three times in their lives. Zacek has already done it twice. As Karmatron, Zacek has all his Kundalini powers enhanced by a tenfold (or more), he has super-strength, near physical invulnerability, the ability to fire a variety of types of rays and bolts, he has flight capability, he can survive in space or in any environment short of a nuclear inferno (which almost killed him once) and he can shrink to microscopic level. Themes Several sci-fi and fantasy elements from the series were based in the boom of both genres during the late seventies and early eighties that took place in American mass media in the west, as well as the super robot and mecha anime genres from Japan in the east. The \\"ancient astronaut theory\\" is one of the principal components of the main storyline in Karmatron. Buddhism, Taoism, Esoterism and Mayanism are also featured heavily in the series. The comic itself was meant to deliver a pastiche of multiple philosophies, doctrines and new age concepts -some of them contradictory between them-, through the story of an intergalactic battle between two forces marked as definitive good versus evil, reinforcing the intention of the author of establishing his own conception of Ying and Yang. The last numbers of the comic were dedicated to themes that did not dealt with the comic story itself, including 8 whole numbers filled with a philosophical and metaphysical indoctrination manual called \\"Manual del guerrero Kundalini\\" (Kundalini Warrior Guide).  Creation and publication  According to Gonz√°lez Loyo most of the main characters, the basic concept and plot of Karmatron were created as early as 1978, but the lack of interested publishers pushed back the release of the comic for several years. The original name for the series was originally intended to be \\"Karmatr√≥n y los Guerreros Estelares\\" (Karmatron and the Stellar Warriors), as initially the robot allies of Karmatron were not supposed to transform at all. However, because of the tremendous success of later eighties animated series with transforming robots such as Transformers and Gobots the publisher requested Gonzalez Loyo to include characters of this type in the comic book, so finally the series would be renamed Karmatron y los Transformables to increase sales. The series was finally published for the first time in February 1986, in a weekly format and until mid 1991. Each comic had 32 pages and the whole original series from the eighties lasted 298 issues. Each comic of the classic eighties series was made completely in one week, but sometimes past numbers were re-edited and relaunched or substituted by issues with great amounts of text to be able to complete its weekly schedule deadline. The creator of the series claims that during the 5 years of its publication the comic managed to have more than 100,000 comics sold. However, there is no registry or any other information to confirm such numbers. In 1992 a new reboot edition was released in a black and white graphic novel format with redesigned characters, but this was a special limited series that lasted just a couple issues. In December 2002 the comic series was again remade entirely by ¬°Ka-Boom! Studio with a modified storyline, new art, improved modern digital coloring, new designs and a bigger, more standard comic book size format. The release schedule of each issue for the new reboot series has been extremely irregular with comics released after 2 months or up to a 1 year hiatus. So far 20 numbers have been published, with the latest issue released in late 2017.  Crossovers  Because of the title's popularity during the eighties, several issues included crossovers with popular characters from other Mexican independent comics of the same period. Numbers 100 to 104 of the original series -published in 1988- included a crossover called \\"Karmatr√≥n vs Destr√∫ktor\\" with several characters from Destr√∫ktor, El Defensor C√≥smico (Destruktor, The Cosmic Defender), another popular Mexican science fiction weekly comic from 1987 that lasted 33 issues and was drawn by artist Nicanor Pe√±a Cabrera. From number 284 to 286 -published in 1991- another crossover called \\"Aventuras en el Planeta Tier- rata\\" (Adventures in Planet Earth-Rat or Adventures in Planet Terrat) took place, where the protagonists were Jiva and Robby (Karmatron sidekicks and comic relief characters from Oscar Gonz√°lez Loyo) as well as Visitor Zot and rats Fulano, Zutano and Mengano (from an indie comic by artist and author Francisco \\"Paco\\" Baca).  Free online version  The first 45 issues of the first Karmatr√≥n y los Transformables comic series -originally published in a weekly schedule during the year 1986- have been made available online by ¬°Ka- Boom! Studio for free since 2008, with later numbers still pending publication. Reception The comic had a decent reception between Mexican comic book readers, as at the time -the late eighties- the amount of new national titles was close to zero, and even American franchises were scarce at that point, with only Grupo Editorial Vid and Novedades Editores taking on the occasional publishing of American comics. The series was also successful partially because of the mid eighties boom of sci-fi anime and cartoons that took place in Mexican TV during that time after the release of animated series such as Mazinger Z, Transformers, Voltron and Robotech. This allowed Karmatron to acquire some fame and notoriety in the comics medium in Mexico. However, as the storyline progressed and the philosophical ideas exposed and the mysticism turned more dense and evident, both the editorial and the public became more and more alienated until the comic ceased to be published in the early nineties. Nevertheless, the series is fondly remembered by many Mexicans who were children during the eighties for its peculiar Japanese anime influenced art style and is still considered one of the first true Mexican sci-fi robot \\"manga\\" works. Also of note was its weekly publication schedule, an uncommon practice during its decade of publication. According to the creator of the comic many foreign comic artists and authors -who published their works monthly- couldn't believe that a weekly comic was even possible at the time of publication of Karmatron. Adaptations The author stated in July 2016 that a Hollywood studio is interested in making a film adaptation of the franchise.

Early life Wood was born in Whyalla, South Australia in 1941. He moved to Geelong where he attended the Geelong College and the Gordon Institute of TAFE, graduating as a mechanical engineer. In 1973 he left Australia to work in the United States, moving to Alamo, California, where he lived with his American wife and daughter, and employed by construction company Bechtel Corporation for 25 years. He later formed his own company and moved from his Californian home to Iraq. His work involved project management, and building nuclear plants; including the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating station in Arizona. Kidnapping In 2005, Wood was kidnapped along with two Iraqi business associates and forced into a cell, while at a home in Baghdad, Iraq where he was organising a business deal. On 2 May 2005, Arabic television network al-Jazeera broadcast footage of Wood being held by armed captors, identified as the Shura Council of the Mujahideen of Iraq. Wood is shown pleading for his life, and urges Australia and the United States to withdraw their troops from the country. On 4 May 2005, Al-Jazeera broadcast an appeal by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Wood's brothers for the insurgents to free Wood. By 7 May 2005, new footage emerged showing Wood, having sustained injuries, with machine guns held to his head. In the video, he read aloud an order to withdraw troops from Iraq within 72 hours. In response, Imam Sheik Alhilali flew to Iraq on 9 May 2005 to attempt to assist with Wood's release. It is during this time that Alhilali claims to have seen Wood, confirming that he was still alive. In response to suggestions that the Australian government or Wood's family might make payments to the kidnappers, Prime Minister John Howard stated that Australia will neither pull troops out, nor pay any ransom that might be demanded. Downer added that any concession to demands could encourage further kidnappings. Wood's family conducted a public relations campaign in both Australia and Iraq, to convince Mr Wood's captors that he was a family man who sympathises with their cause. On 10 May 2005, the deadline given by the kidnappers expired at 5pm Australian time, however there was no indication that Wood had been killed. Six weeks after his capture, Wood was found and rescued by Iraqi army troops from a house in Ghazaliya, with assistance from U.S. forces. The Iraqi troops were performing a routine raid of a suspected weapons cache at the house, before finding Wood. Brigadier General Jaleel Khalaf Shewi, commander of the Iraqi brigade which rescued Wood, said a brief firefight had taken place during the operation, but there were no casualties on either side. It was revealed that Wood's Iraqi business associates were killed a month earlier. On 15 June 2005, news of the rescue was relayed to senior Australian diplomat in Baghdad, Nick Warner. Footage was aired in Australia by CNN showing Wood talking to soldiers and sitting up in bed in a medical facility in Baghdad. Prime Minister John Howard subsequently acknowledged the efforts of Australia's Muslim community and senior cleric Sheikh Taj al-Din al-Hilali, while also confirming that no ransom had been paid. On 20 June, Muslim Sheik Taj Aldin Alhilali returned to Australia, claiming that Douglas Wood would have been killed if it had not been for his intervention. Wood has, however, denied that he ever spoke to Alhilali during his capture.  Aftermath and political position  In 2009, Wood contacted Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, claiming that seven of the ten Iraqi soldiers who rescued Wood in 2005 have been systematically murdered. He argues that they were targeted after giving evidence against his kidnappers. In response, two Iraqi service personnel were granted permanent refugee visas under Australia's humanitarian program, after an assessment of their applications found they were in grave and imminent danger. Wood had previously worked on the failed Jervis Bay feasibility study for a local nuclear power plant, and in response to John Howard's plan for nuclear power production in Australia, Wood stated that he would happily live next door to a nuclear power plant, and would assist in development of an Australian nuclear energy industry. However, he stated his concerns that Australia's engineers and industrial suppliers are under-qualified to build a local plant.

Multiple references may be required to assist in the process of authentication. This is often employed to combat fraudulent practices such as violin forgery and other forms of misrepresentation. Motivation for authentication Much of the price of a fine violin is determined not just by the quality of the instrument, but by the maker. Names like Amati, Guarneri, and Stradivari have become synonymous with excellence in craftsmanship and tone. Relatively unknown makers, capable of producing above-average violins, know that they might be able to command tremendous prices simply by affixing the label of one of these early makers to the instruments of their making. The temptation has been, at times, irresistible. In its newest incarnation, however, instrument fraud appears to have shifted away from the production of clever fakes. The practice of merely misrepresenting the quality of the instrument is on the rise. To combat these and other such practices, the buyer may do well to consult an authenticator to confirm the maker, date, quality and price before purchasing an instrument, particularly when there are huge sums of money at stake. Authentication process Authenticating a violin is a multifaceted process that addresses two issues surrounding the authenticity of an instrument: the year in which it was manufactured, and the maker (essentially the information found on the label). To confirm these two attributes, the authenticator may employ several different techniques. The key to authentication is the idea that there is no single feature of a violin that exists independently of another. This implies that knowing the date narrows the number of makers, just as knowing the maker narrows the field of dates.

M. DeMatteis, with art by Kevin Maguire, created in 1987. Publication history Following the events of company-wide crossovers Crisis on Infinite Earths and Legends, Justice League of America writer J. M. DeMatteis was paired with writer Keith Giffen and artist Kevin Maguire on a new Justice League series. However, at the time, most of the core Justice League characters were unavailable. Superman was limited to John Byrne's reboot, George P√©rez was relaunching Wonder Woman and Mike Baron was launching the Wally West version of the Flash. As a result, the initial team consisted of: * Batman: Denny O'Neil, taking pity on the new creative team, allowed Batman to be used in the series. * Black Canary: Dinah Lance was written as a strong feminist and often clashed with the chauvinist Guy Gardner. * Blue Beetle: A recent acquisition from Charlton Comics. * Captain Marvel: No longer a separate personality, this version focuses on his alter ego's naivet√©. * Doctor Fate: The inclusion of Dr. Fate coincided with a mini series written by DeMatteis and Giffen. * Dr. Light: First appearing in Crisis on Infinite Earths, Kimiyo Hoshi briefly joins the League. * Guy Gardner: Editor Andy Helfer suggested using Guy Gardner over the more well known Hal Jordan. * Martian Manhunter: The only connection to the previous iteration of the Justice League. He soon develops a love for Oreos. * Mister Miracle: The world's greatest escape artist. His wife, Barda, and friend, Oberon, are also associated with the League. The resulting comedic tone was Giffen's idea, introducing new characterizations to old characters: Guy Gardner was now a loutish hothead, Booster Gold was greedier and more inept than he had been in Dan Jurgens' series, and Captain Marvel displayed a childlike personality. The series was nominated as \\"Best New Series\\" in 1988 by the Harvey Awards, but was beat out by Paul Chadwick's Concrete. It also featured Adam Hughes' first work for a major comic publisher. They fight the Champions of Angor, other- dimensional super-heroes intent on destroying all nuclear weapons. Bialya's dictator Rumaan Harjavti takes advantage of the Champions to eliminate his rivals.Justice League #2 In Russia the League fights the Rocket Red Brigade, until Gorbachev allows them to help. Wandjina sacrifices himself to stop a nuclear meltdown, and the League are sent home by international law.Justice League #3 Millionaire entrepreneur Maxwell Lord takes an interest in the team, breaching their security and suggesting Booster Gold as a new member. Booster proves himself in combat against the Royal Flush Gang, and Lord declares himself their press liaison.Justice League #4 Manhunter saves the world when they battle against a conscious psychic plague and he consumes it.Justice League Annual #1 Gardner challenges Batman to a fight over leadership, but Batman knocks him out in one punch. Doctor Fate is captured by the Gray Man, a rogue servant to the Lords of Order.Justice League #5 Teaming up with the Creeper, they release Fate and stop Gray Man from taking over the world.Justice League #6 Earth is attacked by a mysterious satellite, and the League travels into space. Miracle recognizes it as a modified New Genesis Device, and neutralizes it. They return home as heroes. Maxwell Lord introduces a proposal to get United Nations funding, and they are given sponsorship in exchange for government regulation. This plan allows them to act as an independent city-state with worldwide embassies. Captain Atom and Rocket Red #7 are added to the team by the United States and Russia respectively. Captain Marvel and Doctor Fate quit the team for personal reasons; Batman steps down as leader, appointing Martian Manhunter to replace him. They are reintroduced to the world as Justice League International.Justice League International #7 Despite a series of embarrassing accidents, they successfully move in to embassies around the world. This includes Moscow, New York City and Paris. With issue seven, the series was renamed Justice League International to reflect the team's new international status. The name change spawned the term JLI, which is used when referring to this period in Justice League history. The series was again renamed following the launch of Justice League Europe in 1989. The series was known as Justice League America until its cancellation in 1996. =\\"Justice League: Breakdowns\\"= \\"Breakdowns\\" was a 16-issue crossover between the Justice League America (#53‚Äì60) and Justice League Europe (#29‚Äì36) titles, changing the tone of both series from a humorous one to a more serious one, and introducing new creative teams to both books. The major events that occurred were the following: * Maxwell Lord is initially in a coma from a failed assassination attempt. He is later possessed by JLE foe Dreamslayer of the Extremists. Following the end of the \\"Breakdowns\\" saga, Maxwell Lord has no more mental powers, apparently drained completely when possessed by Dreamslayer. * The Queen Bee, ruler of the country Bialya, is killed in a coup d'√©tat led by Sumaan Harjavti, the twin brother of the original dictator, Rumaan. * Despero awakens and escapes Manga Khan's starship to wreak havoc on New York City, seeking vengeance against the Justice League. A force of the Justice League's best (Martian Manhunter, Power Girl, Fire, Rocket Red, Metamorpho, Flash, Guy Gardner, Major Disaster), along with the Conglomerate (led by Booster Gold) and Lobo, were unable to stop him. Ultimately, it was Kilowog and L-Ron who subdued Despero by transferring L-Ron's consciousness into the cybernetic control collar that remained around Despero's neck. * While possessing Maxwell Lord's body, Dreamslayer kidnaps and later murders Mitch Wacky on the island of KooeyKooeyKooey, where the Blue Beetle and Booster Gold previously attempted to open a resort called \\"Club JLI\\". Using Lord's persona, Dreamslayer lures a large portion of the Justice League to the island and takes mental control of them, making them the \\"new Extremists\\". * The Silver Sorceress, one of the former Champions of Angor and a Justice League member, dies defeating Dreamslayer. Her gravesite is on the island of KooeyKooeyKooey. * The U.N. withdraws its support from the Justice League and it disbands. The Martian Manhunter seemingly takes a leave of absence, although he later re-emerges under the persona of Bloodwynd. =Expansion= The Justice League gets a larger roster as seen in Justice League International #24 (Feb, 1989). Cover art by Kevin Maguire & Josef Rubinstein The Justice League titles continued to expand into the early to mid-1990s. Titles included: Justice League America, Justice League Europe, Justice League Task Force, Extreme Justice and Justice League Quarterly. Justice League Europe was later retitled to become the second volume of Justice League International. In the latter part of the series, more recognizable characters, including Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Aquaman, joined, followed by lesser known characters such as Bloodwynd, Maya, Maxima, Nuklon, Obsidian, Tasmanian Devil, and Triumph. Longtime JLI-era characters such as Captain Atom, Martian Manhunter, and Power Girl were revised and revamped. By 1996, with the commercial success of the series fading, each of the titles was eventually cancelled. =Miniseries= In 2003, Giffen, DeMatteis, and Maguire reunited for the six-issue miniseries Formerly Known as the Justice League. This depicted Maxwell Lord trying to get the gang back together as The Super Buddies ‚Äì a Hero-For-Hire group that operated out of a strip mall. 2005 saw a second storyline, I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League, by the same creative team published in the pages of JLA Classified. This tale told a story of the characters attempt to rescue Ice from Hell. =Return= Following Blackest Night, DC launched two alternating 24-issue biweekly comic book limited series, Brightest Day and Justice League: Generation Lost, written by Keith Giffen and Judd Winick. This second series features Captain Atom, Booster Gold, the new Blue Beetle Jaime Reyes, Fire, Ice and a new Rocket Red (by the name of Gavril Ivanovich) and essentially saw the return of Justice League International, as explained by Giffen: Over the course of the series, Power Girl and Batman joined the group as well, with Wonder Woman appearing in the book's final three issues. The title was heavily tied to Winick's run on Power Girl, which had the title character dealing with villains connected to Max Lord's plans in Generation Lost, and eventually had her rejoin the Justice League International after a crossover between the two titles. The title also indirectly tied into Odyssey, a storyline published in Wonder Woman that saw the title character being removed from history with her existence forgotten by most of her fellow heroes. This formed the basis of the book's finale, with the members of the Justice League International racing to track down Wonder Woman before Lord could find her and kill her.Newsarama.com : Generation Lost  Judd Winick  JUDD WINICK: The Future of MAX LORD & the GEN LOST GANG, p.2 Plot threads from Kingdom Come and The OMAC Project also appeared. Generation Lost ended with a teaser that a new Justice League International series would be coming in a few months (with Booster Gold as leader). =The New 52= As part of The New 52, Justice League International was relaunched in September 2011, after the conclusion of the \\"Flashpoint\\" storyline, written by Dan Jurgens and drawn by Aaron Lopresti.Live From The DC New 52 Panel‚Ä¶ Updating  Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movies and TV News and Rumors This Justice League International is formed by United Nations director Andre Briggs as a UN- controlled counterpart to the original Justice League and is based out of the Hall of Justice. The founding lineup of the team consists of Booster Gold, Fire, Ice, Rocket Red (Gavril Ivanovich), Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), Vixen, August General in Iron, and Godiva, who are recruited to the team due to having their identities publicly known. Batman is denied membership due to having a secret identity, but is allowed to accompany the group as part of an effort to foster good relations between the JLI and the original Justice League. The team goes on to defeat the Signal Men and the alien conqueror Peraxxus.Justice League International (vol. 2) #1‚Äì6 (Sept. 2011 ‚Äì March 2012) During a press conference outside the Hall of Justice, Rocket Red is killed when a bomb explodes, while Fire, Ice and Vixen are hospitalized and become comatose.

He was a member of the Melbourne Anarchist Club which formed on 1 May 1886, the first formal anarchist organisation in Australia. In 1899 he was elected to the Trades Hall Eight Hours Day committee and to the executive of Trades Hall Council. He was President of the Fitzroy Political Labor League, the forerunner to an Australian Labor Party branch. For more than sixty years he was a regular speaker at the Queens Wharf and Yarra Bank speakers corners on Sundays. Early life He was born in Derby, England in 1863 to an Irish father, employed as a weaver, and an English mother, employed as a factory hand. His maternal grandfather had been involved in the Corn Laws struggles, and his father was active in strikes in Derby. His mother died when 'Chummy' was five. At the age of 10 he was sent to work in a Leicester boot factory, which took its toll on the boy's health, and gave him a personal understanding of social injustice. In his teens he attended Freethought lectures of Charles Bradlaugh, George Jacob Holyoake and Annie Besant. At the invitation of an uncle living in Melbourne, he migrated to Australia in 1884, gaining immediate work as a bootmaker and joining the Victorian Operative Bootmakers Union. Almost immediately he involved himself in radical politics by attending the second annual Secular Conference in Sydney in 1884, organised by the Australasian Secular Association. In Melbourne he started attending Queens Wharf and North Wharf Sunday afternoon meetings at the Yarra River where popular speakers included Joseph Symes, President of the Australasian Secular Association, Monty Miller, a veteran radical from the Eureka Stockade, and William Trenwith, an aspirant labour politician. Sunday Liberation In late 1889, Fleming was an organiser of the Sunday Liberation Society, and addressed meetings on the need to open the Public Libraries and Museums on Sundays. The Public Library had closed on Sundays due to church pressure. At a meeting near the Working Men's College (now known as Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology), a large crowd gathered. A deputation of five was appointed to visit Parliament House to petition for the Libraries and Museums to open on Sunday. When the deputation left, the crowd followed. The police failed to stop the estimated 6,000 people surging along the street, then up the steps of Parliament, where they finally stopped at the closed doors of Parliament. Several of the organisers received summonses for 'taking part in an unlawful procession' and were imprisoned for a month. The campaign was successful, but numbers attending the Library on Sunday were insufficient, and the Library soon closed its doors on Sunday. Fleming's time in prison was not unproductive. While detained he studied the prison regulations and found that the sanitary arrangements were less than required. So, he stopped the Governor on his weekly rounds, 'lectured him for an hour' whereupon the Governor ordered immediate improvements. Union agitation In 1889, Fleming helped form a Melbourne lodge of the Knights of Labor in Melbourne, as well as being elected to the Eight Hours Committee. In September, 1890 Fleming was first elected as a delegate of the Victorian Operative Bootmakers Union to the Trades Hall Council, and later served on the Executive. He supported inter- colonial strikers, female organisation, and agitation for piece work rates as opposed to a minimum wage which the employers were after. Due to declining union membership, Fleming was instrumental in the Trades Hall Council devising union re-organisation, which resulted in a number of unions being brought into existence and many old ones strengthened. Often his support of grass roots initiatives, self-help and the unemployed put him at odds with trade union bureaucrats and Labor politicians such as William Trenwith, who he accused of 'working with blood-sucking capitalists.' Twelve months later he was elected, unopposed, President of his union for a 6-month term, and for a similar period as President of the Fitzroy branch of the Progressive Political League, the fore-runner of the ALP. Fleming was a supporter of Max Hirsch, author of Democracy versus Socialism. At a Knights of Labor meeting in 1893, Fleming moved the motion for what was subsequently the first May Day procession in Melbourne. This was the start of a long association between Chummy Fleming and May Day in Melbourne. During the 1930s, when Fleming's anarchist politics was out of favour with the May Day Committee, then controlled by the Communist Party of Australia, Fleming started marching a block ahead with his red flag with Anarchy emblazoned in white, going so slowly the march caught up with him; or sometimes he started back In the ranks and gradually edged to the front. In 1895, at a large meeting at the Melbourne Town Hall, Fleming and John White moved a motion successfully opposing the Melbourne Lord Mayor, Sir Arthur Snowden, from chairing the meeting because of remarks he had made supporting very low wages. A commentator in The Tocsin articulated that it forced words to become deeds and resulted in the introduction of the Factories Legislation. In 1904 Fleming was expelled from Trades Hall Council for attacks on Labor parliamentarians (disloyalty to Labor). Fleming's continual criticism of Trades Hall bureaucrats and Labor opportunists was echoed by noted Trade Unionist and socialist, Tom Mann. Unemployed agitation Fleming spent many periods unemployed and was active in unemployed agitation. Many Trade Unions and Trades Hall officials were not sympathetic to unemployed agitation at this time. Fleming described one occasion: :\\"...The unemployed meeting was held on a piece of land near the Workingmen's College. At the conclusion of the meeting, old John White and I carried the calico banner which had written on it: Feed on our flesh and blood, Capitalist hyena; it is your funeral feast. When the unemployed arrived at the Trades Hall they were attacked by unionists. During the fight the banner was destroyed. The police came and ended the fight ...\\" In 1908, as part of an unemployed agitation, Fleming and Percy Laidler, a Marxist, led the unemployed into Federal Parliament in Melbourne, stopping it for one and a half hours. Melbourne Anarchist Club On 1 May 1886 the first meeting of the Melbourne Anarchist Club took place attended by Fleming, Monty Miller, Jack Andrews, David Andrade and several others. In club meetings he gave lectures on 'The Subjection of Women', and the need for sexual freedom in a talk on 'Marriage, Prostitution and the Whitechapel Murders'. He was not noted as a writer or philosopher, but remained on good terms with mutualists, individualists and communist anarchists active in the club. His union and unemployed agitation showed him to be more practical and pragmatic in his adherence to anarchism. He is recorded as having regular correspondence with noted anarchists, Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman, and Max Nettlau and many others. For every year from 1887 he commemorated in Melbourne the execution of the Haymarket Riot Martyrs. On being expelled from Trades Hall Council in 1904, Fleming became heroic and made the following statement: :\\"... I am going to be expelled because I am an anarchist. I am in the company of Tolstoy, Spencer and the most advanced thinkers of the world. Workers will never get their rights while they look to Parliament. A general strike would be more effective than all the Parliaments in the world. I have got a fine stick and I am going to use It. Expel me if you like. I am an anarchist. We have been hanged in Chicago, electrocuted in New York, guillotined in Paris and strangled in Italy, and I will go with my comrades. I am opposed to your Government and to your authority. Down with them. Do your worst. Long live Anarchy\\". For the next forty five years Fleming helped organise or was involved with anarchist meetings in Melbourne. The Anarchist and the Governor-General From 1901 an interesting friendship developed between Chummy Fleming and Lord Hopetoun, Australia's first Governor-General. In May 1901 Fleming protested unemployment in Melbourne by rushing onto the Prince's Bridge to halt the Governor General's carriage. Hopetoun told the police not to interfere and listened to Fleming put the case for the unemployed. Out of this encounter came a friendship which endured after Hopetoun returned to England in July 1902. While in Australia, he is said to have visited Chummy's house at 6 Argyle Place, Carlton, which was built with money he lent Chummy, the house bearing the name 'Hopetoun' when completed (since demolished). According to some reports, Hopetoun is credited with pressuring the government to speed up government work projects. Upon Hopetoun's impending departure, he donated money and 25 dozen bottles of champagne, entrusted to Fleming, for distribution to the unemployed. Several commentators of the period saw this as a round-about slap at the establishment for refusing to pay Hopetoun what he thought he needed. Fleming duly distributed the gifts to the unemployed according to a register: One shilling to each married man and 6d to each single man who attended on 24 June 1902. The following day the bottles of Champagne, along with beer from 6 hogsheads donated by Shamrock Brewery, were distributed by Fleming, (who neither smoked or drank). According to newspaper reports drunkenness and riots ensued. :\\"A representative of \\"The Age\\" asked Mr Fleming why the wine had not been sold and the money distributed. His reply was perhaps characteristic. He said: \\"We are tired of the inequalities among the people. The rich drink champagne and the poor small beer. Besides, it would have been a breach of faith to his Lordship to have sold the wine\\". When \\"The Age\\" reporter pointed to the drunken mob outside, and asked if that was the equality he meant, Mr Fleming could only say that such a thing as the distribution of champagne had never occurred before in Australia, and that champagne was not intended only for dainty stomachs.\\" (The Age, 26 June 1902) \\"Rich Man's War and the Poor Man's Fight\\" Fleming was active in the conscription debates during the first World War, being with the Industrial Workers of the World prepared to take a definite anti-war stance. In Port Melbourne Town Hall for example, he spoke on \\"the Rich Man's War and the Poor Man's Fight.\\" During this period he was frequently arrested, jailed and threatened with being deported by the authorities, or thrown into the river by roughs and on at least one occasion was thrown in. In 1933, he was invited to make a speech at the Congress Against War and Fascism, organised largely by the Communist Party of Australia. It was reported that he took the organisers to task for their doctrinaire approach, and was heavily criticised for it. Yarra Banker Fleming became an institution as a speaker on the Yarra Bank on Sundays. From 1901 until he died in 1950, each Sunday he would set up his Freedom stand, conducting meetings and lecturing on social questions, working conditions and other issues. He announced his meetings with a cow bell, behind him would be draped two red flags: one with 'Anarchy' and the other with 'Freedom' worked on white. On May Day in 1950, after his death, the ashes of Chummy Fleming were scattered among the crowd on the Yarra Bank. He was remembered for his sincerity, courageousness, and dedication to the Australian labour movement.

He was a powerful Nanyang industrialist and a first-class Mandarin of China; he was made Consul-General in Singapore and economic advisor. Early life He was born in 1840 in Dabu, Guangdong, China to a poor Hakka family. Cheong started working at an early age as a cowherd back in his village. At age 16, Cheong had left Guangdong while Cantonese Red Turban rebellion and political purges ravaged much of Guangdong, and in that same year another war had broken out between the Emperor of China and the English, known as the Second Opium War (1856‚Äì1862). The people had experienced hardship and suffering as they fled during the war. As a result, Cheong Fatt Tze migrated to South-East Asia together with other coastal Chinese families to seek their fortune. Career He started as a water-carrier and then became a shopkeeper in Jakarta, Indonesia. After his marriage, he established a trading company with the help of his father-in-law. Gradually, he began to accumulate his wealth through hard work and perseverance. In 1877, he expanded his business from Jakarta to Medan. His business was based on agricultural products such as rubber, coffee and tea but he branched out to the financial sector by acquiring a bank. This move made him a wealthy man. In 1886, he expanded again to Penang, Malaysia. As his business grew, he owned three ships which plied between Penang and Medan. In the course of his work, he occasionally resided in Penang and owned a mansion in Leith Street, which stands to this day as protected heritage building. Political career In 1890, in recognition of his hard work and contribution, he was appointed the Chinese Consul, based in Penang. This office was shifted to Singapore when that city became established as a well- known trading port in South-East Asia. As the Chinese Consul, he worked tirelessly for the interests of overseas Chinese residents through diplomatic channels with the British authorities. In 1899, he was summoned to China twice by the Emperor of China and instructed to present a national development plan, which was well received by the government of the Qing dynasty. As a result, he was promoted to be the Minister for agriculture, industries, roads and mines for the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Later he was instructed to conduct a study of trade and education in Penang and Singapore. Subsequently, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce was established. In 1904, he established the first Chinese school in Southeast Asia, the Chung Hwa Confucian School in Penang. In 1912, the Kuomintang overthrew the Qing and established a republican government. Cheong was appointed as a member of the Legislative Assembly so that he could be actively involved with politics. He was also appointed as the Chairman of the Chinese national Chamber of Commerce, which was well received by all parties. In 1915, he was sent to the United States to study all aspects of industrialization of that nation. During his journey, when he stopped over in Hong Kong, he was awarded a Ph.D. in Law. Death Cheong Fatt Tze died in Indonesia in 1916. His body was sent back to China to be buried. On its final journey through Penang, Singapore and Hong Kong, the overseas Chinese were greatly saddened by the loss of this great personality. The Chinese government sent a high-ranking official to his funeral and ordered the National Archives to record his life in historical documents so that his contributions would always be remembered. Both the British and the Dutch authorities ordered flags to be flown at half mast to honour the man who was known as \\"the Rockefeller of the East\\". He had eight wives and owned many residences throughout his trading empire (mostly Southeast Asia) but made Penang his base, where he raised his six sons. Legacy In 1894, Chung Keng Quee hosted in his own gardens, in the name of Vice Consul Chang Pi Shih (Cheong Fatt Tze), a dinner to welcome Admiral Ting (see Battle of Yalu River (1894) and Battle of Weihaiwei) and the Chinese Imperial Fleet of warships that he commanded. Cheong Fatt Tze first introduced grape vineyards in China's Shandong province, and later brought in Austrian wine-producing experts to improve the ChangYu vineyard in Yantai, Shandong. Cheong Fatt Tze also gave shelter to Sun Yat Sen and Sun Yat Sen 's fourth wife in Penang, Cheong Fatt Tze also helped Sun Yat Sen with Money to promote a Chinese Nationalist movement in China after 1911. A street in George Town, Penang, which was formerly named Hong Kong Street, was renamed after him, Jalan Cheong Fatt Tze. His blue mansion, Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, is a heritage building, located at Leith Street in George Town. It is open for guided tours, and also offers accommodation and has an on-site restaurant. He left another mansion in his birthplace, Dabu, Guangdong Province, China.

It was incorporated in 1991 as Lawyers Title Corporation, and renamed LandAmerica after Lawyers Title acquired Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company and Transnation Title Insurance Company in 1998. It was headquartered in Glen Allen, Virginia. The company's subsidiaries were primarily title insurers; however, they offered a number of other real estate transaction services. Through its subsidiaries, principally Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company and Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation (its third largest subsidiary, Transnation Title Insurance Company, was merged into Lawyers Title in 2008) LandAmerica principally engaged in the title insurance business in the United States. Its products and services facilitated the purchase, sale, transfer, and financing of residential and commercial real estate. The company operated primarily in three segments: Title Insurance, Lender Services, and Financial Services. The Title Insurance segment provided title insurance, escrow and closing services, commercial real estate services, property appraisal and valuation, building and site assessments, survey coordination, construction disbursement, coordination of national multistate transactions, tax-deferred real property exchanges, and real estate transaction management services. The Lender Services segment provided services to regional and national lending institutions, which complemented those offered in the company‚Äôs title insurance business. These services consisted primarily of real estate tax processing, flood certification services, mortgage credit reporting, default management services, and mortgage loan subservicing. The Financial Services segment engaged in originating and purchasing of commercial real estate loans in the southern California market, as well as soliciting deposits through certificates of deposit and passbook savings accounts. The company provided its services to lenders, developers, real estate agents, attorneys, and property buyers and sellers. It served residential and commercial customers with approximately 1,000 offices and a network of over 10,000 agents throughout the United States, Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean, Latin America, and Europe. Bankruptcy On November 26, 2008, LandAmerica filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Today it is a ghost town, abandoned and largely destroyed. It is located on the shores of Granby Bay in coastal Observatory Inlet, about southeast of (but no land link to) Stewart, British Columbia, and about , across wilderness, east of the tip of the Alaska Panhandle. Early history The remote valley was long a hunting and trapping area for the Nisga'a, and the name Anyox means ‚Äúhidden waters‚Äù in the Nisga'a language. The first Europeans in the area were the members of the Vancouver Expedition, who surveyed the inlet in 1793. Nisga'a legends told of a mountain of gold, attracting speculators for years. In 1910, the Granby Consolidated Mining, Smelting and Power Company (Granby Consolidated) started buying land in the area. They soon found gold. Town and mines Granby Consolidated started construction of the town in 1912. By 1914, Anyox had grown to a population of almost 3,000 residents, as the mine and smelter were put into full operation; rich lodes of copper and other precious metals were mined from the nearby mountains. Granby Consolidated moved its copper mining interests here from Greenwood, British Columbia. Copper was mined from the Hidden Creek and Bonanza deposits and smelted on site. Coal to fuel the smelter was shipped from the company built and owned town of Granby on Vancouver Island and Fernie in southeastern British Columbia. Anyox had no rail nor road links to the rest of British Columbia, with all connection served by ocean steamers that traveled to Prince Rupert ( southwest) and Vancouver. The company town was a very large operation with onsite railways, machine shops, curling rink, golf course and a hospital. In the spring of 1918, Granby Consolidated built the first wooden tennis court in Canada, for additional recreation. That same year, incoming ships brought the Spanish flu epidemic to Anyox. Charles Clarkson Rhodes, the Chief Accountant for the Granby Consolidated operations in Anyox, died on October 29, 1918, while helping to treat patients in the Anyox Hospital. Dozens of workers and residents of Anyox died from that flu epidemic. In the early 1920s, concrete pioneer and dam engineer John S. Eastwood designed a hydroelectric dam which, standing high, was the tallest dam in Canada for many years. Anyox was almost wiped out by forest fires in 1923, but the townsite was rebuilt and mining operations continued. Acid rain from the smelter denuded the trees from the hillsides which soon became bare. The Great Depression drove down the demand for copper, effectively the beginning of the end for Anyox. Operations continued, but were steadily scaled down while the company stockpiled of copper, three years of production, that it was unable to sell. The mine shut down in 1935, and the town was abandoned. Salvage operations in the 1940s removed most machinery and steel from the town, and two forest fires, in 1942 and 1943, burned all remaining wood structures. During its 25 year existence, Anyox‚Äô mines and smelters produced of gold, of silver and of copper. Ongoing developments Active mineral exploration continues in the area. In the 1980s, local entrepreneurs teamed with Vancouver investors to purchase the long dormant operations from the owner of record. Whenever there is a rise in the price of copper, there is speculation about the possibility of re-development - though none has ever occurred. Since 2000, the current owners have been trying to attract interest in rehabilitating the hydroelectric dam, to either supply the British Columbia grid or to attract and serve an on-site natural gas liquefaction facility. Notable residents Former Vancouver mayor Jack Volrich was one of the 351 people born in Anyox. As was Thomas Waterland, MLA for Yale-Lillooet from 1975 to 1986. Reid Mitchell, who represented Canada in basketball at the 1948 Olympics, also was born in Anyox. Garnet Webber was born June 22, 1935, possibly the last baby born prior to the town shutting down.

Publication history A version of her first appeared in Super Friends #25, (October 1979), and was created by E. Nelson Bridwell and Ramona Fradon. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= Super Friends Beatriz as the Green Fury Beatriz da Costa, alias Green Fury, had originally been bequeathed her powers due to Brazilian mysticism and was the president of the Brazilian branch of Wayne Enterprises. She possessed an array of abilities which included the power to exhale vast quantities of mystical green fire. She could also fly, alter her clothing at will, and displayed a limited capacity to project hallucinations. In her first appearance, she confronted and battled Superman, who was controlled by the \\"puppet master\\" Overlord, Sandor Fine. In her next appearance, Green Fury called The Super Friends to help defeat the villain Green Thumb (Fargo Keyes),\\"Super Friends\\" #42 (March 1981) and months later revealed her secret origin to them to thwart the demons from a green hell. Global Guardians Green Fury became a member of the Global Guardians when Superman, recruited by Doctor Mist, asks for assistance in locating one of many ancient artifacts being pursued by a powerful group of evil mystics. They battle a wizard called 'El Dorado' in an ancient, overgrown city deep in the jungle. The two face off against 'spirit jaguars' and seemingly lose the artifact, a crown, to the wizard. Costa then assists Superman and other Guardians in battling the wizards, El Dorado included, on Easter Island. The heroes catch a break when it's learned Superman had faked the artifacts with super-speed. This prevents the rise to power of the entity the wizards followed, Thaumar Dhai. Though not as powerful as planned, Dhai was still a threat. Green Fury's mystical based powers were essential in destroying him. =Post-Crisis= After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, her history was altered so that she had followed an unusual career path. Renamed Beatriz Bonilla da Costa, she started as an amateur model on the beaches of Rio, then becoming a showgirl and stage performer before finding herself serving as a top secret agent for Brazilian government's SNI (Servi√ßo Nacional de Informa√ß√µes - National Information Service), actually Abin (Ag√™ncia Brasileira de Intelig√™ncia - Brazilian Intelligence Agency). In the course of one of her missions, Beatriz was trapped in a pyroplasmic explosion that endowed her with the unusual power of being able to exhale an eight-inch burst of fire. She assumed the identity of the Green Fury, and then soon changed it again to Green Flame. She joined the international superhero team the Global Guardians, of which she was a long-standing, loyal member.Secret Origins #33 She first met the American heroes Infinity, Inc. while on a mission to Canada.Infinity, Inc. #32 Justice League Shortly after changing her name to Green Flame, the Guardians' United Nations funding was withdrawn in the wake of the formation the Justice League International. Beatriz convinced her teammate and best friend Icemaiden into joining her to apply for Justice League International membership. Remarkably, in the wake of Black Canary's resignation and the abduction of several members, the short- handed JLI took them on.Justice League International #14 Eventually, she once again changed her heroic name, this time to Fire in affinity with Icemaiden's shortening of her name to simply Ice.Justice League International #19 As a result of the \\"gene bomb\\" detonated by the alien Dominators, Fire's powers were dramatically increased, but were less reliable for a time.Invasion! #3, Justice League America #28 Fire always assumed a big sister role with Ice, watching out for her and her interactions with the \\"real\\" world. For example, Fire stepped in when Ice did not realize she was being stalked by a delusional fan. However, Fire herself makes mistakes, such as torching the cash she'd just saved while foiling a bank robbery. Beatriz remained with the Justice League International for the remainder of its existence ‚Äî in fact she served the longest tenure of any JLI member. During this time, she was also trained in the arts of battle by Big Barda. In the battle against Doomsday, Bea lost her powers by taxing them to their limits while trying to blast Doomsday, in effect \\"her fire went out\\".Superman vol. 2 #74 She remained with the team but by the time she returned in Justice League America #88, it was too late to help prevent her best friend's death, as Ice was killed by the Overmaster.Justice League Task Force #14 As Beatriz tried to cope with this loss, she briefly had a romantic relationship with Ice's former lover, Guy Gardner, and a longer one with Nuklon. When the first Icemaiden, Sigrid Nansen, joined the League Ice's place, Fire befriended her. However, their friendship was tainted by Bea's irrational grief-driven behavior, and Sigrid's romantic attraction to Bea. When this League collapsed, Beatriz returned to Brazil, and tried to re-establish herself as the country's main protector. This met with varied success, which she blamed partly on the Martian Manhunter's prominence in the Southern hemisphere.Martian Manhunter #10 The Super Buddies Fire eventually tried to retire from being a superhero and establish a career as an internet glamor girl when Maxwell Lord talks her and several other former JLI members into reforming as a group of \\"heroes for the common man\\" called the \\"Super Buddies\\". She found herself sharing an apartment with Mary Marvel and, in a characterization reminiscent of her relationship with Ice, became a reluctant \\"babysitter\\" for the naive teenager. In one adventure with the Super Buddies, Fire and the others were given the opportunity to rescue Ice's spirit from Hell (or a similar dimension). Yet like in the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, Fire could not resist looking behind her, which caused Ice's spirit to vanish. During the Super Buddies' time in Hell, Etrigan the Demon suggested that it was Fire who was fated to die instead of Ice. Later, during her time in the group, she encounters an alternate universe version of Ice. Infinite Crisis The Super Buddies did not realize that Maxwell Lord was also secretly the Black King of Checkmate. After the Buddies' dissolution, Bea became an agent of Checkmate as well. It has not been revealed whether Lord recruited her. Regardless, she helps Booster Gold and Guy Gardner find the connection between Lord and the death of the Blue Beetle. She joins her former JLI teammates against a group of OMACs. She is badly wounded, but is saved by the sacrifice of Dimitri Pushkin, the Rocket Red.The OMAC Project #4 During the \\"Infinite Crisis,\\" created by Alexander Luthor, Beatriz returns to her espionage roots by joining Amanda Waller, who took over Checkmate after Lord's death. One of Fire's first missions was to retrieve the A.I., Brother Eye, which had crashed down in Southern Saudi Arabia. This plan was thwarted by Sasha Bordeaux, also formerly of Checkmate.OMAC Project Special She appears later, criticizing Booster for his shameless self-promotion while the search continues for the missing superheroes.52 #4 She is also on hand at a memorial for Ralph Dibny's wife, Sue.52 #42 Checkmate Nearly one year later, after the Crisis, Checkmate was reformed under the supervision of the United Nations and Beatriz became the Black King's Knight.Checkmate #1 Though she no longer reported to Waller (who was made White Queen), Waller blackmailed Bea with evidence against her father and forced Bea to perform covert assassinations.Checkmate #11 Waller had previously implied that Beatriz actually enjoyed the violence and depravity that was a part of her job. It was revealed that as a girl Bea had been trained to kill by her father.Checkmate #11‚Äì12 Despite her past as a dutiful soldier and daughter, Bea expressed remorse over taking part in a Checkmate mission that resulted in the deaths of as many as 50 Kobra agents, many of whom were immolated by Fire herself.Checkmate #2 Waller once again blackmailed Fire into covering up a coup in Santa Prisca. There, Fire killed Colonel Computron for Waller in order to protect her father, who, in the mid-1970s, under a right wing military dictatorship, had ordered thousands of innocent deaths in Operation Condor, a US-supported South American anti- communist program that involved assassinations, torture and forced disappearances. He was never caught and Beatriz had always kept his secret. When the murder of Computron was exposed by fellow Knight Tommy Jagger, Fire was jailed. After a visit from her superior, the Black King, Col. Taleb Beni Khalid-Isr, Beatriz agreed to turn over her father to international authorities for war crimes. Khalid had convinced her to act as the superhero that he'd chosen for his Knight. Reunited with Ice In Checkmate #16, after years of anguish and grief over the loss of her friend and ally Ice, Fire is at last reunited with her after the long-deceased hero is miraculously resurrected in the pages of Birds of Prey.Birds Of Prey #107 (August 2007) Their renewed relationship, never shown on panel, is referenced again when Ice, accepting a date on Oa with her lover Guy Gardner, refuses his proposal to cohabit on Oa claiming how she decided to get her life together, on Earth, with some help from Beatriz herself. Gardner claims that Fire is manipulating Ice.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #29 (October 2008) Generation Lost Fire appears as one of the central characters in Justice League: Generation Lost, a maxi-series that takes place during the wider Brightest Day event. At the start of the series, Fire is recruited as part of a massive group of superheroes tasked with hunting down the JLI's founder and Ted Kord's murderer, Maxwell Lord. During an encounter with Max at the Justice League's former New York headquarters, Fire is rendered unconscious alongside Ice, Booster Gold, and Captain Atom. The former Justice League members awake to discover that Lord has used his mental abilities to erase his existence from the minds of every single human on the planet, save for those present at the embassy.Justice League: Generation Lost #1 (May 2010) After she tries to tell Wonder Woman of her killing of Lord, Wonder Woman refuses to believe it. Fire discovers that Max has mentally influenced the world into believing that Checkmate has dismissed her for failing her psychological evaluation.Justice League: Generation Lost #2 (May 2010) Afterward, Fire encounters Lord in JLI headquarters.Justice League: Generation Lost #8 (August 2010) After mind- controlling Fire and then Booster Gold to prevent them from stopping him, he ports from the old JLI embassy back to Checkmate.Justice League: Generation Lost #9 (September 2010) Before they can figure out their next move, the base comes under attack by the Creature Commandos. Caught while powered down, Fire is shown having been shot several times.Justice League: Generation Lost #15 (December 2010) Fire is able to heal by using the bandages of the medic mummy of the Creature Commandos, but is unable to keep Blue Beetle from being kidnapped by Maxwell Lord.Justice League: Generation Lost #16 (December 2010) While the team deals with the apparent loss of Blue Beetle, Fire bonds with Gavril Ivanovich the current Rocket Red and the two grow close, eventually sharing a passionate kiss.Justice League: Generation Lost #21 (March 2011) =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Fire appears as part of the Justice League International team. Fire is injured toward the end of the first story arc and is sidelined for the remainder of the run. Powers and abilities The original Green Fury had magical flame breath powers due to Brazilian mysticism. She could control her flame breath to allow her to fly and land like a rocket. She was able to mystically alter her clothing when needed and change the color of her eyes from green to black, and vice versa. She was also able to create and cast illusions with her \\"dazzle power\\" and fire blasts with her white-hot flame or super-cold freezing flame. Her green flame had the magical ability to heal and repair her costume after a battle. Beatriz was also trained by Batman in hand- to-hand combat. Due to the events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Green Fury never had any of these magical powers and had a new revised origin. In her Post-Crisis incarnation, Beatriz's only power, gained from saturation by an organic energy source called Pyroplasm, was the ability to breathe a jet of green flame from her mouth. During the Invasion crossover event, the alien Dominators set off a \\"metagene bomb\\" in the upper atmosphere which affected almost all DC characters with superpowers and, after a period of illness, Fire found her powers greatly magnified as an after-effect. The \\"new\\" Fire was now able to completely turn into a being of green plasma, in which form she could fly and throw devastating blasts. Solid objects could pass completely through her form without causing injury. Unfortunately, it took her some time to come to terms with her increased powers, and she often \\"flamed on\\" involuntarily when stressed or angry (and sometimes still does), a distressingly common event for a character depicted as having a tendency towards passionate outbursts. The Super Buddies continuity established (and made light of) the fact that flaming on destroyed Bea's clothing, rendering her naked when she stopped using her powers. Checkmate and other appearances have ignored this. Beatriz is also a skilled investigator and espionage agent, and in the latter context was considered a valuable asset by Checkmate chief Amanda Waller for her ability and willingness to kill in order to complete missions (unlike many of her contemporaries who maintain a no-kill policy).

It may include ensuring conformance to standards or models, such as ISO/IEC 9126 (now superseded by ISO 25010), SPICE or CMMI.Kelemen, Z√°dor D√°niel; Kusters, Rob; Trienekens Jos Identifying criteria for multimodel software process improvement solutions ‚Äì based on a review of current problems and initiatives It includes standards and procedures that managers, administrators or even developers may use to review and audit software products and activities to verify that the software meets quality criteria which link to standards. According to Automotive SPICE (which is based on ISO/IEC 15504), software quality assurance is a supporting process (SUP.1) that provides the independent assurance that all work products, activities and processes comply with the predefined plans and quality strategies. SQA encompasses the entire software development process, including requirements engineering, software design, coding, code reviews, source code control, software configuration management, testing, release management and software integration. It is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements, verification and validation.Nielsen, David CMM and Project Quality Management  Purpose  SQA involves a three-prong approach: * Organization-wide policies, procedures and standards * Project-specific policies, procedures and standards * Compliance to appropriate procedures Guidelines for the application of ISO 9001:2015 to computer software are described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 90003:2018. External entities can be contracted as part of process assessments to verify that projects are standard-compliant. More specifically in case of software, ISO/IEC 9126 (now superseded by ISO 25010) should be considered and applied for software quality.  Activities  Quality assurance activities take place at each phase of development. Analysts use application technology and techniques to achieve high-quality specifications and designs, such as model-driven design. Engineers and technicians find bugs and problems with related software quality through testing activities. Standards and process deviations are identified and addressed throughout development by project managers or quality managers, who also ensure that changes to functionality, performance, features, architecture and component (in general: changes to product or service scope) are made only after appropriate review, e.g. as part of change control boards.

It is developed by developer Wladimir Palant's Eyeo GmbH, a German software company. The extension has been released for Mozilla Firefox (including mobile), Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge (Chromium based version), Opera, Safari, Yandex Browser, and Android. In 2011, Adblock Plus and Eyeo attracted considerable controversy over its \\"Acceptable Ads\\" program to \\"allow certain non-intrusive ads\\" (such as Google AdWords) to be allowed under the extension's default settings. While participation in the whitelisting process was free for small websites, large advertising companies were required to pay a fee in order for their ads to be whitelisted. Background The original version of Adblock (0.1) was written as a side project for Firefox by Danish software developer Henrik Aasted S√∏rensen, a university student at the time, in 2002. It hid image ads through user-defined filters from the page but did not actually prevent them from being downloaded. S√∏rensen maintained the open source project until Adblock 0.3 after which the project changed hands. This was also the last stable release of Adblock. Starting with Adblock 0.4, in early 2003, the development of Adblock was taken over by rue. This version used XBL to hide the ads and with this objects like Flash or Java could also be blocked. But as with the original version the ads were still able to be downloaded. This was a developer build and not a stable release as were subsequent further versions (either released as nightly or development builds) making Adblock 0.3 the last stable release. Adblock 0.5, 2004, used content policies for ad blocking which prevented the ads from being downloaded instead of simply hiding them. Background images, scripts and stylesheets could be blocked through this approach as well. XBL support was dropped in this version in favor of content policies. These updates were implemented by rue with the help of Wladimir Palant who contributed other developments as well. Sometime after Adblock 0.5's release the development of the project stalled. Development stagnated beginning in 2004 and entirely stopped in early 2005. That's when Michael McDonald created a separate enhanced version of Adblock called Adblock Plus 0.5 to improve upon the original and add additional features. No update for the original Adblock was issued even after Firefox 1.5's release in November 2005. An official update supporting 1.5 was released more than a month later. In the meantime McDonald had released a compatible Adblock Plus version for Firefox 1.5. Wladimir Palant wanted to help rue with the development of Adblock 0.5 but did not continue due to development disagreements. He eventually took over development of Adblock Plus from McDonald and rewrote the codebase, releasing Adblock Plus 0.6 in January 2006, thus making Adblock Plus a separate extension and not simply an enhanced version of Adblock. Development of the original Adblock stopped with version 0.5 and the project was abandoned in late 2006. History and statistics Michael McDonald created Adblock Plus 0.5, which improved on the original Adblock by incorporating the following features: * whitelisting * support for blocking background images * subscription to filters with a fixed address and automatic updates * the ability to hide HTML elements, allowing a greater range of images to be blocked * the ability to hide ads on a per-site basis, instead of globally * memory leak fixes * improvements to the user interface McDonald discontinued development and transferred the name to Wladimir Palant, who released Adblock Plus 0.6 with a rewritten codebase in January 2006. PC World chose Adblock Plus as one of the 100 best products of 2007, featuring in at 95. Adblock Plus for Google Chrome has been available since December 2010 and has over 10 million users. It has also become the most popular extension for Firefox, with around 14 million users as of December 2017. Adblock Plus was released as an app for Android devices in November 2012. On March 3, 2013, the Android app was removed from the Google Play Store along with similar ad-blocking apps. Some apps remain in the Play Store with the caveat that they require root access in order to function. Adblock Plus, while not in the Play Store, is still available on the app's website. Users can download the .apk file directly and install it as a third-party app if they allow \\"Unknown Sources\\" in Android settings. The application page as of December 2017 features the Adblock Browser for Android instead of the original app. Adblock Plus has been available for Internet Explorer since August 2013, Safari since January 2014, and Yandex Browser since December 2014. An Adblock Plus browser beta version was made available in May 2015, called the \\"Adblock Browser\\". Adblock Browser 1.0 was released on September 7, 2015, based on Firefox for mobile. Adblock Plus has created an independent board to review what is an acceptable ad and what is not. Operation Like Mozilla's built- in image blocker, Adblock Plus blocks HTTP and HTTPS requests according to their source address and additional context information and can block iframes, scripts, and Flash. It also uses automatically generated user stylesheets to hide elements such as text ads on a page as they load instead of blocking them, known as element hiding. =Android= On rooted devices, the Android app blocks ads on all web traffic including mobile networks. For non-rooted devices, ads are only blocked through a Wi-Fi connection and requires the user to set up a local proxy server for each network in order for the app to function. The app uses a local proxy server to intercept web traffic and remove ads before showing content to the user. Most of the content that users are trying to block will be removed, though some content is missed and the app is not as reliable at blocking ads as the browser versions. The app can be configured to auto-start every time the device reboots, minimizing the action required by the user. =Filters= Basic filter rules can include wildcards represented by asterisks (\`*\`). Sites and objects can be whitelisted with filters that start with two at signs (\`@@\`). Regular expressions delimited by slashes (\`/\`) can be used. Adblock Plus also supports a more-sophisticated syntax that gives fine-grain control over filters. An example of the sophisticated filtering would be \`wikipedia.org##div#centralNotice\`, which will hide the centralNotice element used by Wikipedia to display donation requests. =Filter subscriptions= Users can add external filtersets. Adblock Plus includes the ability to use one or more external filter subscriptions that are automatically updated. Filterset.G is incompatible with this system (and Adblock Plus specifically recommends against using Filterset.G for other reasons as well), but other filtersets can be added by typing their addresses. A list of known Adblock Plus subscriptions is maintained on the Adblock Plus official website. EasyList was the most popular Adblock Plus filter list as of August 2011, with over 12 million subscribers./ Created by Rick Petnel, it became officially recommended by the Adblock Plus program, and filter lists for other languages were built on top of it. Petnel died in 2009 following which Palant placed a user named \\"Ares2\\" as the new maintainer. The filter lists EasyList and EasyPrivacy are both subscribed by default in uBlock Origin but not in Adblock Plus itself. Both of these filter lists will also be used by Google Chrome starting February 15, 2018, on sites not complying with the Better Ads Standards. In May 2013, the former second most popular Adblock Plus filter list, Fanboy's List, was merged with EasyList. =Legal challenges= In December 2014, it was reported that Zeit Online and Handelsblatt had brought suit against Eyeo GmbH in the . In April 2015 the court rejected the suit.Landsgericht Hamburg 16. Kammer f√ºr Handelssachen, Urteil vom 21.04.2015, 416 HKO 159/14 (Anonymized) Axel Springer SE has filed a court order for the removal of the Adblock Plus post though there is a redacted version and people have posted videos and posts on how to get around the Axel Springer wall. However, in April 2018, Germany's Federal Constitutional Court found in favor of Eyeo and ruled that Adblock Plus did not violate any laws. In August 2017, the Admiral advertising company sent a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice to EasyList to remove the domain functionalclam.com from the blacklist. Admiral argues that the domain is part of its access control technology of its advertising platform, and therefore the blacklisting is an attempt to circumvent a technical protection measure, which is forbidden under the DMCA section 1201. Detection Some webmasters have used JavaScript to detect the effects of the popular Adblock Plus filters. This is done by generating a honeypot-like URL, verifying its delivery, and DOM verification after the web page is rendered by the web browser, to ensure the expected advertising elements are present. Detection is simplified since the extension is not yet capable of replacing content; Loopback proxies provide this additional functionality. These methods do not detect the presence of the Adblock Plus extension directly, only the effects of the filters. They are vulnerable to continued filter updates, and whitelist-filtering web scripts with extensions such as NoScript. An attempt was made to detect the plug-in itself, but that detection method was rendered unusable by the 0.7.5.2 update of Adblock Plus. Google Chrome had a defect in Content Security Policy that allowed the detection of any installed extension, including Adblock Plus for Google Chrome. The solution for this issue arrived in Google Chrome 18, and required each developer to make changes to their extensions. Adblock Plus for Google Chrome fixed this in version 1.3.  Security  Starting with Adblock Plus 3.2 for Chrome, Firefox and Opera, the Adblock Plus filter syntax allowed filter lists to execute arbitrary code in the context of certain kinds of web pages via the \`$rewrite\` filter option. This feature could be used by list maintainers to fix bugs in web pages caused by ad blocking or to circumvent ad blocker detection, but also could be abused by malicious filter rules. This issue was not unique to Adblock Plus and affected all extensions that offered such functionality. By contrast, uBlock Origin did not support this functionality and required all such scripts to pass a manual verification by the uBlock Origin maintainers. The issue was fixed in Adblock Plus 3.5.2 for Chrome, Firefox and Opera.  Controversies  = Controversy over ad filtering and ad whitelisting = The owners of some websites which use third-party hosted online advertising to fund the hosting of their websites have argued that the use of ad-blocking software such as Adblock Plus risks cutting off their revenue stream. While some websites such as The New York Times and The Daily Telegraph have successfully implemented subscription and membership-based paywall systems for revenue, many websites today rely on third-party hosted online advertising to function. On December 5, 2011, Wladimir Palant announced that certain \\"acceptable\\" ads would be whitelisted in upcoming builds of the Adblock Plus software, with the option to remove whitelisted ads by using a custom setting in the software. According to Palant, only static advertisements with a maximum of one script will be permitted as \\"acceptable\\", with a preference towards text-only content. The announcement generated controversy both on Adblock Plus's website and on social media sites like Reddit. In 2012, Adblock Plus's managing director Till Faida told the Swiss newspaper Thurgauer Zeitung that the \\"strategic partners\\" on Adblock Plus's whitelist would not be named, but that the partnership is part of the company's \\"Acceptable Ads\\" whitelist project. In February 2013, an anonymous source accused Adblock Plus developer Wladimir Palant of offering to add his site's advertisements to the whitelist in return for one-third of the advertisement revenue. In June 2013, blogger Sascha Pallenberg accused the developers of Adblock Plus of maintaining business connections to \\"strategic partners in the advertising industry\\", and called ABP a \\"mafia-like advertising network\\". He alleged that Adblock Plus whitelisted all ads coming from \\"friendly\\" sites and subsidiaries, and promoted their product using fake reviews and pornography. Faida responded to Pallenberg's accusations, stating that \\"a large part of the information concerning the collaboration with our partners is correct\\", but that the company did not see these industry connections as a conflict of interest. He said that the company is convinced that the \\"acceptable ads\\" business model will be successful and says that the whitelisting criteria are \\"completely transparent\\". He also stated that \\"We have an initiative called Acceptable Ads to support websites with unobtrusive ads. Every website can participate. The [Pallenberg] article on purpose just slanders our good name\\". Attacks were made in 2016 against ad-blocking with paid whitelists‚Äîthough Adblock Plus was not mentioned by name‚Äîby content providers who provide content free of charge to users, deriving revenue from advertisements, and by industry and government sources who criticise the \\"unsavoury\\" business model, which has been described as a \\"modern-day protection racket\\". In May 2016, Adblock Plus parent company Eyeo began a collaboration with the online donation service Flattr to create a service that would allow users to automatically donate money to online publishers based on their engagement. The service was conceived as a way for users to automatically support online publishers as an alternative to advertising; Eyeo would acquire Flattr outright the following year, seeking to expand upon this model as Flattr's main service. In September 2016, Eyeo announced that it would launch a \\"marketplace\\" for ads that meet its acceptability criteria. = \\"Acceptable ads\\" = Starting with version 2.0, AdBlock Plus started allowing \\"acceptable ads\\" by default, with acceptable ad standards being set by The Acceptable Ads Committee. They also have started charging large institutions fees to become whitelisted and marked as \\"acceptable\\", stating \\"[Adblock Plus] only charge large entities a license fee so that we can offer the same whitelisting services to everyone and maintain our resources to develop the best software for our users.\\" on their about page. The inclusion of chumboxes such as Taboola and Outbrain has led some people to characterize the \\"acceptable ads\\" program as simple extortion. Most of the whitelisted \\"acceptable ads\\", including Google's Adwords, did not respect the user's Do Not Track choices and do, in fact, track the user.

History Welland was originally created in 1867 by the British North America Act. It consisted initially of the Townships of Bertie, Crowland, Humberstone, Stamford, Thorold, and Willoughby, and the Villages of Chippawa, Clifton, Fort Erie, Thorold and Welland. In 1892, the riding was redefined to exclude reference to the Village of Clifton, and include the villages of Niagara Falls and Port Colborne, and the town of Niagara Falls. In 1903, it was redefined to consist of the county of Welland. In 1952, it was redefined to consist of the townships of Pelham, Thorold, Crowland, Humberstone and Wainfleet, including the city of Welland and the towns of Port Colborne, Thorold, Fonthill and Humberstone. In 1966, it was redefined to consist of: * in Welland County, the City of Welland and the Townships of Crowland, Humberstone and Wainfleet; and * in Haldimand County, the Townships of Canborough, Dunn, Moulton and Sherbrooke. In 1976, it was redefined to consist of the City of Welland, the Town of Thorold, and the part of the City of St. Catharines lying south of the Canadian National Railway. The electoral district was abolished in 1987 when it was redistributed between Welland‚ÄîSt. Catharines‚ÄîThorold, St. Catharines and Erie ridings. A new riding, named Niagara Centre was created in 1996 from parts of Erie and Welland‚ÄîSt. Catharines‚ÄîThorold ridings. It existed only for the 1997 and 2000 elections.

It is a second-order method in time. It is implicit in time and can be written as an implicit Runge‚ÄìKutta method, and it is numerically stable. The method was developed by John Crank and Phyllis Nicolson in the mid 20th century.. For diffusion equations (and many other equations), it can be shown the Crank‚ÄìNicolson method is unconditionally stable.. Example 3.3.2 shows that Crank‚ÄìNicolson is unconditionally stable when applied to u_t=au_{xx}. However, the approximate solutions can still contain (decaying) spurious oscillations if the ratio of time step Œî times the thermal diffusivity to the square of space step, Œî, is large (typically larger than 1/2 per Von Neumann stability analysis). For this reason, whenever large time steps or high spatial resolution is necessary, the less accurate backward Euler method is often used, which is both stable and immune to oscillations. The method The Crank‚ÄìNicolson stencil for a 1D problem. The Crank‚ÄìNicolson method is based on the trapezoidal rule, giving second-order convergence in time. For linear equations, the trapezoidal rule is equivalent to the implicit midpoint method - the simplest example of a Gauss-Legendre implicit Runge- Kutta method - which also has the property of being a geometric integrator. For example, in one dimension, suppose the partial differential equation is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = F\\\\left(u,\\\\, x,\\\\, t,\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x},\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\right) Letting u(i \\\\Delta x,\\\\, n \\\\Delta t) = u_{i}^{n}\\\\, and F_{i}^{n} = F evaluated for i, n and u_{i}^{n}, the equation for Crank‚ÄìNicolson method is a combination of the forward Euler method at n and the backward Euler method at n + 1 (note, however, that the method itself is not simply the average of those two methods, as the backward Euler equation has an implicit dependence on the solution): :\\\\frac{u_{i}^{n + 1} - u_{i}^{n}}{\\\\Delta t} = F_{i}^{n}\\\\left(u,\\\\, x,\\\\, t,\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x},\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(forward Euler)} :\\\\frac{u_{i}^{n + 1} - u_{i}^{n}}{\\\\Delta t} = F_{i}^{n + 1}\\\\left(u,\\\\, x,\\\\, t,\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x},\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(backward Euler)} :\\\\frac{u_{i}^{n + 1} - u_{i}^{n}}{\\\\Delta t} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[ F_{i}^{n + 1}\\\\left(u,\\\\, x,\\\\, t,\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x},\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\right) + F_{i}^{n}\\\\left(u,\\\\, x,\\\\, t,\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x},\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{(Crank-Nicolson)}. Note that this is an implicit method: to get the \\"next\\" value of u in time, a system of algebraic equations must be solved. If the partial differential equation is nonlinear, the discretization will also be nonlinear so that advancing in time will involve the solution of a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, though linearizations are possible. In many problems, especially linear diffusion, the algebraic problem is tridiagonal and may be efficiently solved with the tridiagonal matrix algorithm, which gives a fast \\\\mathcal{O}(N) direct solution as opposed to the usual \\\\mathcal{O}(N^3) for a full matrix, in which N indicates the matrix size. Example: 1D diffusion The Crank‚ÄìNicolson method is often applied to diffusion problems. As an example, for linear diffusion, :{\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial t} = a \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} applying a finite difference spatial discretization for the right hand side, the Crank‚ÄìNicolson discretization is then : :\\\\frac{u_{i}^{n + 1} - u_{i}^{n}}{\\\\Delta t} = \\\\frac{a}{2 (\\\\Delta x)^2}\\\\left( (u_{i + 1}^{n + 1} - 2 u_{i}^{n + 1} + u_{i - 1}^{n + 1}) + (u_{i + 1}^{n} - 2 u_{i}^{n} + u_{i - 1}^{n}) \\\\right) or, letting r = \\\\frac{a \\\\Delta t}{2(\\\\Delta x)^2}: :-r u_{i + 1}^{n + 1} + (1 + 2 r)u_{i}^{n + 1} - r u_{i - 1}^{n + 1} = r u_{i + 1}^{n} + (1 - 2 r)u_{i}^{n} + r u_{i - 1}^{n}\\\\, given that the terms on the right-hand side of the equation are known, this is a tridiagonal problem, so that u_{i}^{n + 1}\\\\, may be efficiently solved by using the tridiagonal matrix algorithm in favor of a much more costly matrix inversion. A quasilinear equation, such as (this is a minimalistic example and not general) :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = a(u) \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} would lead to a nonlinear system of algebraic equations which could not be easily solved as above; however, it is possible in some cases to linearize the problem by using the old value for a, that is a_{i}^{n}(u)\\\\, instead of a_{i}^{n + 1}(u)\\\\,. Other times, it may be possible to estimate a_{i}^{n + 1}(u)\\\\, using an explicit method and maintain stability. Example: 1D diffusion with advection for steady flow, with multiple channel connections This is a solution usually employed for many purposes when there is a contamination problem in streams or rivers under steady flow conditions but information is given in one dimension only. Often the problem can be simplified into a 1-dimensional problem and still yield useful information. Here we model the concentration of a solute contaminant in water. This problem is composed of three parts: the known diffusion equation (D_x chosen as constant), an advective component (which means the system is evolving in space due to a velocity field), which we choose to be a constant Ux, and a lateral interaction between longitudinal channels (k). where C is the concentration of the contaminant and subscripts N and M correspond to previous and next channel. The Crank‚ÄìNicolson method (where i represents position and j time) transforms each component of the PDE into the following: {\\\\Delta t}}} Now we create the following constants to simplify the algebra: : \\\\lambda= \\\\frac{D_x\\\\Delta t}{2 \\\\Delta x^2} : \\\\alpha= \\\\frac{U_x\\\\Delta t}{4 \\\\Delta x} : \\\\beta= \\\\frac{k\\\\Delta t}{2} and substitute (), (), (), (), (), (), Œ±, Œ≤ and Œª into (). We then put the new time terms on the left (j + 1) and the present time terms on the right (j) to get: : -\\\\beta C_{Ni}^{j+1}-(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha)C_{i-1}^{j+1} +(1+2\\\\lambda+2\\\\beta)C_{i}^{j+1}-(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)C_{i+1}^{j+1}-\\\\beta C_{Mi}^{j+1} = \\\\beta C_{Ni}^{j}+(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha)C_{i-1}^{j} +(1-2\\\\lambda-2\\\\beta)C_{i}^{j}+(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)C_{i+1}^{j}+\\\\beta C_{Mi}^{j}. To model the first channel, we realize that it can only be in contact with the following channel (M), so the expression is simplified to: : -(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha)C_{i-1}^{j+1} +(1+2\\\\lambda+\\\\beta)C_{i}^{j+1}-(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)C_{i+1}^{j+1}-\\\\beta C_{Mi}^{j+1} = +(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha)C_{i-1}^{j} +(1-2\\\\lambda-\\\\beta)C_{i}^{j}+(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)C_{i+1}^{j}+\\\\beta C_{Mi}^{j}. In the same way, to model the last channel, we realize that it can only be in contact with the previous channel (N), so the expression is simplified to: : -\\\\beta C_{Ni}^{j+1}-(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha)C_{i-1}^{j+1} +(1+2\\\\lambda+\\\\beta)C_{i}^{j+1}-(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)C_{i+1}^{j+1}= \\\\beta C_{Ni}^{j}+(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha)C_{i-1}^{j} +(1-2\\\\lambda-\\\\beta)C_{i}^{j}+(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)C_{i+1}^{j}. To solve this linear system of equations we must now see that boundary conditions must be given first to the beginning of the channels: C_0^{j}: initial condition for the channel at present time step C_{0}^{j+1}: initial condition for the channel at next time step C_{N0}^{j}: initial condition for the previous channel to the one analyzed at present time step C_{M0}^{j}: initial condition for the next channel to the one analyzed at present time step. For the last cell of the channels (z) the most convenient condition becomes an adiabatic one, so :\\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial x}_{x=z} = \\\\frac{(C_{i + 1} - C_{i - 1})}{2 \\\\Delta x} = 0. This condition is satisfied if and only if (regardless of a null value) : C_{i + 1}^{j+1} = C_{i - 1}^{j+1}. \\\\, Let us solve this problem (in a matrix form) for the case of 3 channels and 5 nodes (including the initial boundary condition). We express this as a linear system problem: : \\\\begin{bmatrix}AA\\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix}C^{j+1}\\\\end{bmatrix}=[BB][C^{j}]+[d] where : \\\\mathbf{C^{j+1}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} C_{11}^{j+1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{12}^{j+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{13}^{j+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{14}^{j+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{21}^{j+1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{22}^{j+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{23}^{j+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{24}^{j+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{31}^{j+1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{32}^{j+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{33}^{j+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{34}^{j+1} \\\\end{bmatrix} and \\\\mathbf{C^{j}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} C_{11}^{j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{12}^{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{13}^{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{14}^{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{21}^{j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{22}^{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{23}^{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{24}^{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{31}^{j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{32}^{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{33}^{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{34}^{j} \\\\end{bmatrix}. Now we must realize that AA and BB should be arrays made of four different subarrays (remember that only three channels are considered for this example but it covers the main part discussed above). : \\\\mathbf{AA} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} AA1 & AA3 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ AA3 & AA2 & AA3\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & AA3 & AA1\\\\end{bmatrix} and : \\\\mathbf{BB} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} BB1 & -AA3 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -AA3 & BB2 & -AA3\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -AA3 & BB1\\\\end{bmatrix} where the elements mentioned above correspond to the next arrays and an additional 4x4 full of zeros. Please note that the sizes of AA and BB are 12x12: : \\\\mathbf{AA1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} (1+2\\\\lambda+\\\\beta) & -(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha) & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha) & (1+2\\\\lambda+\\\\beta) & -(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha) & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha) & (1+2\\\\lambda+\\\\beta) & -(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -2\\\\lambda & (1+2\\\\lambda+\\\\beta)\\\\end{bmatrix} , : \\\\mathbf{AA2} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} (1+2\\\\lambda+2\\\\beta) & -(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha) & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha) & (1+2\\\\lambda+2\\\\beta) & -(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha) & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -(\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha) & (1+2\\\\lambda+2\\\\beta) & -(\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -2\\\\lambda & (1+2\\\\lambda+2\\\\beta) \\\\end{bmatrix} , : \\\\mathbf{AA3} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\beta & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -\\\\beta & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\\\beta & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -\\\\beta \\\\end{bmatrix} , : \\\\mathbf{BB1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} (1-2\\\\lambda-\\\\beta) & (\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha) & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha) & (1-2\\\\lambda-\\\\beta) & (\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha) & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & (\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha) & (1-2\\\\lambda-\\\\beta) & (\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 2\\\\lambda & (1-2\\\\lambda-\\\\beta)\\\\end{bmatrix} & : \\\\mathbf{BB2} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} (1-2\\\\lambda-2\\\\beta) & (\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha) & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha) & (1-2\\\\lambda-2\\\\beta) & (\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha) & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & (\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha) & (1-2\\\\lambda-2\\\\beta) & (\\\\lambda-\\\\alpha)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 2\\\\lambda & (1-2\\\\lambda-2\\\\beta) \\\\end{bmatrix}. The d vector here is used to hold the boundary conditions. In this example it is a 12x1 vector: : \\\\mathbf{d} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} (\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha)(C_{10}^{j+1}+C_{10}^{j}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha)(C_{20}^{j+1}+C_{20}^{j}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\lambda+\\\\alpha)(C_{30}^{j+1}+C_{30}^{j}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{bmatrix}. To find the concentration at any time, one must iterate the following equation: : \\\\begin{bmatrix}C^{j+1}\\\\end{bmatrix}=\\\\begin{bmatrix}AA^{-1}\\\\end{bmatrix}([BB][C^{j}]+[d]). Example: 2D diffusion When extending into two dimensions on a uniform Cartesian grid, the derivation is similar and the results may lead to a system of band-diagonal equations rather than tridiagonal ones. The two-dimensional heat equation :{\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial t} = a abla^2 u :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = a \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2}\\\\right) can be solved with the Crank‚ÄìNicolson discretization of :\\\\begin{align}u_{i,j}^{n+1} &= u_{i,j}^n + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{a \\\\Delta t}{(\\\\Delta x)^2} \\\\big[(u_{i+1,j}^{n+1} + u_{i-1,j}^{n+1} + u_{i,j+1}^{n+1} + u_{i,j-1}^{n+1} - 4u_{i,j}^{n+1}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\qquad {} + (u_{i+1,j}^{n} + u_{i-1,j}^{n} + u_{i,j+1}^{n} + u_{i,j-1}^{n} - 4u_{i,j}^{n})\\\\big]\\\\end{align} assuming that a square grid is used so that \\\\Delta x = \\\\Delta y. This equation can be simplified somewhat by rearranging terms and using the CFL number :\\\\mu = \\\\frac{a \\\\Delta t}{(\\\\Delta x)^2}. For the Crank‚ÄìNicolson numerical scheme, a low CFL number is not required for stability, however it is required for numerical accuracy. We can now write the scheme as: :\\\\begin{align}&(1 + 2\\\\mu)u_{i,j}^{n+1} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2}\\\\left(u_{i+1,j}^{n+1} + u_{i-1,j}^{n+1} + u_{i,j+1}^{n+1} + u_{i,j-1}^{n+1}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\quad = (1 - 2\\\\mu)u_{i,j}^{n} + \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2}\\\\left(u_{i+1,j}^{n} + u_{i-1,j}^{n} + u_{i,j+1}^{n} + u_{i,j-1}^{n}\\\\right).\\\\end{align} Solving such a linear system is not practical due to extremely high time complexity of solving a linear system by the means of gaussian elimination or even Strassen algorithm. Hence an alternating direction implicit method can be implemented to solve the numerical PDE whereby one dimension is treated implicitly and other dimension explicitly for half of the assigned time-step and vice versa for the remainder half of the time-step. The benefit of this strategy is that the implicit solver only requires a tridiagonal matrix algorithm to be solved. The difference between the true Crank‚ÄìNicolson solution and ADI approximated solution has an order of accuracy of O(\\\\Delta t^4) and hence can be ignored with a sufficiently small time-step. Application in financial mathematics Because a number of other phenomena can be modeled with the heat equation (often called the diffusion equation in financial mathematics), the Crank‚ÄìNicolson method has been applied to those areas as well. Particularly, the Black‚ÄìScholes option pricing model's differential equation can be transformed into the heat equation, and thus numerical solutions for option pricing can be obtained with the Crank‚ÄìNicolson method. The importance of this for finance is that option pricing problems, when extended beyond the standard assumptions (e.g. incorporating changing dividends), cannot be solved in closed form, but can be solved using this method. Note however, that for non-smooth final conditions (which happen for most financial instruments), the Crank‚ÄìNicolson method is not satisfactory as numerical oscillations are not damped. For vanilla options, this results in oscillation in the gamma value around the strike price. Therefore, special damping initialization steps are necessary (e.g., fully implicit finite difference method).

Software rendering is the process of generating an image from a model by means of computer software. In the context of computer graphics rendering, software rendering refers to a rendering process that is not dependent upon graphics hardware ASICs, such as a graphics card. The rendering takes place entirely in the CPU. Rendering everything with the (general-purpose) CPU has the main advantage that it is not restricted to the (limited) capabilities of graphics hardware, but the disadvantage that more semiconductors are needed to obtain the same speed. Rendering is used in architecture, simulators, video games, movies and television visual effects and design visualization. Rendering is the last step in an animation process, and gives the final appearance to the models and animation with visual effects such as shading, texture-mapping, shadows, reflections and motion blurs. Rendering can be split into two main categories: real-time rendering (also known as online rendering), and pre-rendering (also called offline rendering). Real-time rendering is used to interactively render a scene, like in 3D computer games, and generally each frame must be rendered in a few milliseconds. Offline rendering is used to create realistic images and movies, where each frame can take hours or days to complete, or for debugging of complex graphics code by programmers. Real-time software rendering For real-time rendering the focus is on performance. The earliest texture mapped real-time software renderers for PCs used many tricks to create the illusion of 3D geometry (true 3D was limited to flat or Gouraud-shaded polygons employed mainly in flight simulators.) Ultima Underworld, for example, allowed a limited form of looking up and down, slanted floors, and rooms over rooms, but resorted to sprites for all detailed objects. The technology used in these games is currently categorized as 2.5D. One of the first games architecturally similar to modern 3D titles, allowing full 6DoF, was Descent, which featured 3D models entirely made from bitmap textured triangular polygons. Voxel-based graphics also gained popularity for fast and relatively detailed terrain rendering, as in Delta Force, but popular fixed-function hardware eventually made its use impossible. Quake features an efficient software renderer by Michael Abrash and John Carmack. With its popularity, Quake and other polygonal 3D games of that time helped the sales of graphics cards, and more games started using hardware APIs like DirectX and OpenGL. Though software rendering fell off as a primary rendering technology, many games well into the 2000s still had a software renderer as a fallback, Unreal and Unreal Tournament for instance, feature software renderers able to produce enjoyable quality and performance on CPUs of that period. One of the last AAA games without a hardware renderer was Outcast, which featured advanced voxel technology but also texture filtering and bump mapping as found on graphics hardware. In the video game console and arcade game markets, the evolution of 3D was more abrupt, as they had always relied heavily on single-purpose chipsets. 16 bit consoles gained RISC accelerator cartridges in games such as StarFox and Virtua Racing which implemented software rendering through tailored instruction sets. The Jaguar and 3DO were the first consoles to ship with 3D hardware, but it wasn't until the PlayStation that such features came to be used in most games. Games for children and casual gamers (who use outdated systems or systems primarily meant for office applications) during the late 1990s to early 2000s typically used a software renderer as a fallback. For example, Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue has a choice of selecting either hardware or software rendering before playing the game, while others like Half-Life default to software mode and can be adjusted to use OpenGL or DirectX in the Options menu. Some 3D modeling software also feature software renderers for visualization. And finally the emulation and verification of hardware also requires a software renderer. An example of the latter is the Direct3D reference rasterizer. But even for high-end graphics, the 'art' of software rendering hasn't completely died out. While early graphics cards were much faster than software renderers and originally had better quality and more features, it restricted the developer to 'fixed-function' pixel processing. Quickly there came a need for diversification of the looks of games. Software rendering has no restrictions because an arbitrary program is executed. So graphics cards reintroduced this programmability, by executing small programs per vertex and per pixel/fragment, also known as shaders. Shader languages, such as High Level Shader Language (HLSL) for DirectX or the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), are C-like programming languages for shaders and start to show some resemblance with (arbitrary function) software rendering. Since the adoption of graphics hardware as the primary means for real-time rendering, CPU performance has grown steadily as ever. This allowed for new software rendering technologies to emerge. Although largely overshadowed by the performance of hardware rendering, some modern real-time software renderers manage to combine a broad feature set and reasonable performance (for a software renderer), by making use of specialized dynamic compilation and advanced instruction set extensions like SSE. Although nowadays the dominance of hardware rendering over software rendering is undisputed because of unparalleled performance, features, and continuing innovation, some believe that CPUs and GPUs will converge one way or another and the line between software and hardware rendering will fade. =Software fallback= For various reasons such as hardware failure, broken drivers, emulation, quality assurance, software programming, hardware design, and hardware limitations, it is sometimes useful to let the CPU assume some or all functions in a graphics pipeline. As a result, there are a number of general-purpose software packages capable of replacing or augmenting an existing hardware graphical accelerator, including: * RAD Game Tools' Pixomatic, sold as middleware intended for static linking inside D3D 7‚Äì9 client software. * SwiftShader, a library sold as middleware intended for bundling with D3D9 & OpenGL ES 2 client software. * The swrast, softpipe, & LLVMpipe renderers inside Mesa work as a shim at the system level to emulate an OpenGL 1.4‚Äì3.2 hardware device. * WARP, provided since Windows Vista by Microsoft, which works at the system level to provide fast D3D 9.1 and above emulation. This is in addition to the extremely slow software-based reference rasterizer Microsoft has always provided to developers. * The Apple software renderer in CGL, provided in Mac OS X by Apple, which works at the system level to provide fast OpenGL 1.1‚Äì4.1 emulation. Pre-rendering Contrary to real-time rendering, performance is only of second priority with pre-rendering. It is used mainly in the film industry to create high-quality renderings of lifelike scenes. Many special effects in today's movies are entirely or partially created by computer graphics. For example, the character of Gollum in the Peter Jackson The Lord of the Rings films is completely computer-generated imagery (CGI). Also for animation movies, CGI is gaining popularity. Most notably Pixar has produced a series of movies such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, and the Blender Foundation the world's first open movie Elephants Dream. Because of the need for very high-quality and diversity of effects, offline rendering requires a lot of flexibility. Even though commercial real-time graphics hardware is getting higher quality and more programmable by the day, most photorealistic CGI still requires software rendering. Pixar's RenderMan, for example, allows shaders of unlimited length and complexity, demanding a general-purpose processor. Techniques for high realism like raytracing and global illumination are also inherently unsuited for hardware implementation and in most cases are realized purely in software.

Leonardo was given the commission by the Augustinian monks of San Donato in Scopeto in Florence in 1481, but he departed for Milan the following year, leaving the painting unfinished. It has been in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence since 1670. Description The Virgin Mary and Child are depicted in the foreground and form a triangular shape with the Magi kneeling in adoration. Behind them is a semicircle of accompanying figures, including what may be a self-portrait of the young Leonardo (on the far right). In the background on the left is the ruin of a pagan building, on which workmen can be seen, apparently repairing it. On the right are men on horseback fighting and a sketch of a rocky landscape. The ruins are a possible reference to the Basilica of Maxentius, which, according to Medieval legend, the Romans claimed would stand until a virgin gave birth. It is supposed to have collapsed on the night of Christ's birth (in fact it was not even built until a later date). The ruins dominate a preparatory perspective drawing by Leonardo, which also includes the fighting horsemen. The palm tree in the center has associations with the Virgin Mary, partly due to the phrase \\"You are stately as a palm tree\\" from the Song of Solomon, which is believed to prefigure her. Another aspect of the palm tree can be the usage of the palm tree as a symbol of victory for ancient Rome, whereas in Christianity it is a representation of martyrdom‚Äîtriumph over death‚Äîso in conclusion we can say that the palm in general represents triumph. The other tree in the painting is from the carob family, the seeds from the tree are used as a unit of measurement. They measure valuable stones and jewels. This tree and its seeds are associated with crowns, suggesting Christ as the king of kings or the Virgin as the future queen of heaven, as well as that this is nature's gift to the new born Christ. As with Michelangelo's Doni Tondo, the background is probably supposed to represent the Pagan world supplanted by the Christian world, as inaugurated by the events in the foreground. The artist uses bright colors to illuminate the figures in the foreground of the painting. Jesus and the Virgin Mary are, in fact, painted yellow, the color of light. The trees are painted blue, an unusual color for trees of any kind. On the right side the most credible self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci as a 30-year-old can be seen, according to several critics. (See Angelo Paratico http://www.lascarpublishing.com/leonardo/) Much of the composition of this painting was influenced by an earlier work of the Northern artist Rogier van der Weyden. The relationship between figures, space and the viewer's standpoint, the high horizon, slightly raised viewpoint, space receding into the far distance, and a central figural group poised before a rock formation in the middle of the landscape are all copied from van der Weyden's Entombment of Christ (1460, Uffizi Gallery, Italy).V. Schmidt (ed), Italy and the Low Countries: artistic relations: the fifteenth century (Florence, 1999), pp. 49‚Äì51  Other painters involved  Owing to the painting's unfinished status in 1481, the commission was handed over to Filippino Lippi, who painted another Adoration of the Magi, completed in 1496, in substitution of the one commissioned to Leonardo. It is housed in the Uffizi in Florence. Domenico Ghirlandaio completed a separate painting, expanding upon Leonardo's theme, in 1488. In 2002, Dr. Maurizio Seracini, an art diagnostician alumnus of the University of California, San Diego and a native Florentine, was commissioned by the Uffizi to undertake a study of the paint surface to determine whether the painting could be restored without damaging it. Seracini, who heads Editech, a Florence-based company he founded in 1977 focused on the \\"diagnostics of cultural heritage\\", used high-resolution digital scans as well as thermographic, ultrasound, ultraviolet and infrared diagnostic techniques to study the painting in ultra-fine detail. He concluded that the painting could not be restored without damaging it and that Leonardo only did the underdrawing. Another artist (or artists) was responsible for all of the existing paintwork on top of the underdrawing. Seracini stated that \\"none of the paint we see on the Adoration today was put there by Leonardo.\\" As a part of his diagnostic survey on the Adoration of the Magi, Seracini completed more than 2,400 detailed infrared photographic records of the painting's elaborate underdrawing, and scientific analyses.full presentation by Florence.tv that shows Leonardo's underdrawing discovered by Seracini. The new images revealed by the diagnostic techniques used by Seracini were initially made public in 2002 in an interview with New York Times reporter Melinda Henneberger. In 2005, nearing the end of his investigation, Seracini gave another interview, this time to Guardian reporter John Hooper. Seracini finally published his results in 2006: M. Seracini, \\"Diagnostic Investigations on the Adoration of the Magi by Leonardo da Vinci\\" in The Mind of Leonardo ‚Äì The Universal Genius at Work, exhibit catalogue edited by P. Gauluzzi, Giunti Florence, 2006, pp. 94‚Äì101. In the Smithsonian Channel TV program, Da Vinci Detective, Seracini conjectures that, upon seeing the preliminary drawings for the altarpiece they had commissioned, they rejected it due to the sensational scenario presented to them. Fully expecting a traditional interpretation including the three wise men, they were instead confronted with a maelstrom of unrelated, half- emaciated figures surrounding the Christ-Child, as well as a full-blown battle scene in the rear of the picture. They chose instead to relegate it to a storage house, rather than to destroy the original work. It was only much later, and probably in the context of the subsequent rise in value of Leonardo artworks, that it was resurrected and painted over by unknown persons to make it more \\"sale-able.\\" This later re-working of the panel resulted in alterations to Leonardo's original design for the piece. Restoration The Uffizi Gallery has recently completed a six-year restoration of the work. It has been fully cleaned with years of dirt and old varnish removed. The result is a work that is incredibly bright, with Da Vinci's charcoal outline and marks clearly visible.image of the restored painting, National Geographic, 2019.05.01 (scroll down through the article) The wood panels have also been restored, ensuring the stability of the work for generations to come. National Geographic's coverage of the painting, after the restoration, offers this commentary: > \\"Leonardo's Adoration of the Magi divulges brushstrokes, colors, and images > long hidden under dirt and darkened varnish. The unfinished painting, > commissioned in 1481, also shows evidence of the artist‚Äôs thought process, > including modifications he made as he worked\\".

Its remains were first collected in the Cedar Mountain Formation in 1999, with subsequent findings made during the 2000s. The genus is known from multiple specimens ranging from immature to fully-grown individuals. Falcarius was a long bipedal herbivore with a small head and an elongated neck and tail. Unlike advanced therizinosaurs, Falcarius had a propubic pelvis and three-toed feet with a reduced hallux (first digit). Falcarius is the basalmost known definitive therizinosaurian genus, and has been considered a transitional form connecting the typical theropod bodyplan to the unusual morphology of Therizinosauridae. Its description in 2005, following that of the basal therizinosauroid Beipiaosaurus from the Early Cretaceous of China in 1999, helped clarify the early evolution of the Therizinosauria and its relationships within the larger group of Theropoda. History of discovery Reconstructed skull in dorsal view The remains of Falcarius were first discovered in 1999 by commercial fossil collector Lawrence Walker at the Crystal Geyser Quarry site in Grand County. He informed paleontologist James I. Kirkland of the find, who with a team of the Utah Geological Survey from 2001 onwards began to uncover the bones that proved to be present in a two- acre (8,000-square-meter) area of Utah's Cedar Mountain Formation (Yellow Cat member). Falcarius thus lived in the Early Cretaceous period. Two extensive bone beds were discovered, including the remains of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of individuals of the new species. The minimum number of individual animals was in 2006 estimated at three hundred. In 2005 over two thousand specimens had been excavated, mostly consisting of disarticulated bones. These included the remains of juvenile animals. In 2008 a second site was reported, the Suarez Quarry, with mainly adult individuals, but of a perhaps slightly different type. In 2010 the number of specimens from the original quarry had increased to over 2,700, and was later that year reported to have risen to over three thousand. Block containing dense concentration of Falcarius bones (specimen number CEUM 8429). On display at the USU Eastern Prehistoric Museum, Price, Utah The first remains were partially described and discussed in 2004 on several abstracts by paleontologists Lindsay E. Zanno, then a doctoral student at the University, James I. Kirkland, Scott D. Sampson, chief curator at the University of Utah's Utah Museum of Natural History, Donald D. DeBlieux, David K. Smith and R. Kent Sanders. It was not formally named until a subsequent paper published in the May 2005 issue of the journal Nature. Dr. Sampson was quoted as saying: Zanno subsequently and informally described Falcarius as \\"the ultimate in bizarre: a cross between an ostrich, a gorilla, and Edward Scissorhands.\\" The generic name, Falcarius, is literally taken from the Latin falcarius (meaning sickle cutter) in reference to the large hand claws. The specific name, utahensis, reflects the provenance from Utah. The holotype specimen, UMNH VP 15000, consists of a partial braincase and a large number of paratypes were assigned: specimens UMNH VP 12283, 12285, 12286, 12288, 12290, 12292, 12293, 12315, 12321-12329, 12343-12345, 12347-12349, 12360, 12363, 12366, 12369-12373, 12377, 12380, 12383-12384, 12386-12389, 12392-12394, 12396-12400, 12402-12404, 12406, 12410-12417, 12419-12425, 12427-12439, 12441-12443, 14530-14533, 14537-14538, 14542-14557, 14560-14565, 14568-14582, 14584-14656, 14658-14666, 14668-14670, 14672-14676, 14678-14680, 14682-14690, 14692-14699, 14701-14999 and 15001-15149. Apart from this extensive hypodigm, dozens of other bones were referred to the species. Falcarius has since been described in detail by Zanno in a series of studies, beginning with her thesis in 2004. Description Size comparison of an average individual Falcarius is known from multiple specimens at different ontogenic stages. While the smallest specimen was approximately less than , average adults were about in length weighing approximately . Falcarius can be differentiated from other therizinosaurian taxa in: on the underside of the braincase there is a well-developed depression, the recessus basisphenoidalis. At the back of the head there are deep depressions below the occipital condyle and on the subotics, each with several pneumatic grooves. On the thumb claw the raised attachment point for the tendon of the extensor muscle is bordered by deep grooves for ligaments. The large skull opening in the snout, the fenestra antorbitalis, is positioned in a depression which reaches the side of the nasal bone. There are at least five pairs of conical teeth in the front of the lower jaws. These teeth are hollowed-out at the inside. On the underside of the vertebrae of the neck there is a depression with at the mid-line a ridge. The vertebrae of the back have below their front extensions, the prezygapophyses, a groove which is divided in three smaller depressions. The middle vertebrae of the back have a second ridge extending from the base of the upper rib joint, the diapophysis, to the back of the vertebra. In the arm, the shaft of the humerus is reinforced by powerful, somewhat obliquely placed, thickenings extending towards the condyles of the lower joint, which swellings have a hollow front edge. The front edge of the hip joint has a prominent swelling, pointing sideways to the back, on the pubis. =Skull= Dentary teeth of UMNH VP 14527 and UMNH VP 15259 The head anatomy of Falcarius is partially known. The skull was small and elongated. With its long neck, Falcarius could apparently reach about off the ground to munch leaves or fruit. The teeth numbered at least sixteen in the maxilla of the upper jaw. The dentary (part of the lower jaw) carried twenty-eight teeth. Its small leaf-shaped and very finely serrated maxillary teeth indicate that it consumed plant material. The front-most five teeth of the lower jaw are much longer, straighter and more pointed though, and might indicate a partially omnivorous diet including meat, e.g. small animals such as lizards. In the back of the head, the braincase was relatively large. Its lower elements were moderately inflated by pneumatised, hollowed-out, bone tissue. =Postcranial skeleton= The partitioning of the vertebral column followed that of most maniraptorans. The neck was very long with elongated cervical vertebrae. The tail was relatively long. The arm was moderately long with a somewhat robust humerus. The relatively large, and slightly recurved, pointed ten- to thirteen- centimeter (four- to five-inch) hand claws were likely used in self-defence. Pectoral girdle of skeletal cast Falcarius is known from many specimens, including complete forelimb specimens. Most of the bones of the pectoral girdle and forelimb are known, although sternal bones are not preserved. Both a left and right scapula are preserved, and they are both mostly complete as well. The blades of the scapulae are about long, and also quite slender, with barely any expansion. They are curved instead of straight. The scapula is placed in a relatively high position. Two coracoids are also preserved, although they differ more than the scapulae in morphology. The right coracoid is the better preserved of the two. The coracoid is not specially enlarged. The furcula is elongated and narrow, its branches placed at an angle of 104¬∞. It is V-shaped and possesses a small hypocleidium at the front. The arm as a whole is not especially developed in length but shows signs of an increasing robustness. The humerus has a rather short triangular deltopectoral crest. The epicondyles are exceptionally thick, indicating a strong musculature. The ulna is lightly curved. The hand is rather long but not very robust, with in general an elongated metacarpus, although the first metacarpal is short. The first finger diverges from the second finger, the longest of the hand. The third finger is very thin. The hand claws are moderately curved, rather pointed, and moderately long. In the pelvis the ilium was by a moderate inclination partly adapted to a more raised position of the trunk. The pelvis was propubic or mesopubic: the pubic bone pointed more or less forwards. The leg was relatively long and adapted to running, with the lower leg longer than the thighbone. In the foot there were three weight-bearing toes. The first toe did not reach the ground nor did the first metatarsal touch the ankle. Classification The describers in 2005 assigned Falcarius to the Therizinosauroidea sensu of Zhang, in a basal position. Zanno later placed it as the basalmost taxon in the Therizinosauria, just outside of Therizinosauroidea sensu of Sereno. Because of the primitive position and relative completeness of Falcarius, it is a good taxon to use to compare to related groups and descendant taxa. Falcarius resembles dinosaurs belonging to the Therizinosauridae, part of the group Maniraptora. Falcarius itself probably does not belong to this former group, although it does belong to the more inclusive group Therizinosauria. The group is characterized by wider hips, a comparatively large braincase and long necks typical of plant eaters. The less basal Asian specimens were covered in quill-like feathers; this is assumed for Falcarius as well. In general Falcarius can be seen as a transitional form between the original theropod build and the more derived Therizinosauridae. Falcarius shared some derived traits with the therizinosaurids: it had a long neck, small head with teeth adapted for eating plant material, a more robust arm with large hand-claws and a more vertical position of the body. On the other hand, it resembled more typical theropods in having a long tail, a propubic pelvis, a long lower leg and a foot without a fourth toe reaching the ground. The propubic pelvis of Falcarius, with the pubis pointing forwards The cladogram below shows the results of a phylogenetic analysis of Therizinosauria performed by Hartman et al. in 2019, based on the extensive revision by Zanno in 2010.

In 1948, the College moved to its present location on East 71st Street and became a four-year bachelor degree- granting college; the first class graduated from MMC in 1950. In 1961, MMC was granted an absolute charter as an independent four-year college by the Regents of the University of the State of New York. Our History, Marymount Manhattan College website Since 1961, Marymount Manhattan has been an independent, private college open to all creeds, while noting its foundation by the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary. While the college no longer described itself as Catholic, the Catholic Church continued to list it in the Catholic Directory until 2005. Unaware that the college did not claim to be a Catholic school, the Cardinal Newman Society protested the college's announcement of its decision to invite then-Senator Hillary Clinton to deliver a commencement address and to confer an honorary doctoral degree upon her,College Honoring Clinton Declared 'No Longer Catholic', Catholic News Agency May 2, 2005 retrieved 12-29-08 due to Senator Clinton's longtime public support for abortion rights.

A work car parked inside the Greenwood Shop TTC's Greenwood Shop located at the complex The Greenwood Yard (also known as the Greenwood Complex) is a rail yard with support buildings that service subway vehicles on Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth of the Toronto subway system. Greenwood is one of two subway yards on Line 2, the other being the much smaller Keele Subway Yard. Site Spanning , the Greenwood Yard is located at 400 Greenwood Avenue, on the west side of Greenwood south of Danforth Avenue. The site is bordered on the west, south and east sides by residential areas, and on the south side by a railway line. The yard contains 5 buildings, two of which are the General Overhaul and Repair Shop (a.k.a. Greenwood Shop) with a floor space of , and the carhouse for inspection, minor repairs and washing. The Greenwood Shop has specialized shops for heavy overhauls of subway cars and components as well as stores. The Greenwood Shop is operationally separate from the carhouse servicing the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth subway fleet. When it opened, the yard had a storage capacity for 244 subway cars. The yard currently has a 328 car storage capacity. The Greenwood Yard is connected to the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line by a multi-level wye between Donlands and Greenwood stations; the wye allows both east and westbound mainline trains access to the yard. The arrangement allows for trains to be added into or taken out of service with minimum disruption to ongoing operations. Current operations Greenwood Yard is home to approximately half the Commission's fleet of trains and work cars. The yard regularly houses the majority of the fleet of T1 subway cars and all Line 2 trains overnight. Greenwood Yard provides storage, inspection and running maintenance for the Line 2 revenue fleet, and contains major overhaul and repair shops for the entire subway fleet. Greenwood Yard is also a centre for the servicing and operation of workcars used by the Track and Structure Department to repair and maintain the entire subway system. The Greenwood Yard also performs the heavy maintenance on the ICTS cars from Line 3 Scarborough, that the McCowan Yard cannot handle. Because the gauge and technology differences between lines 2 and 3, ICTS cars must be transported by truck to Greenwood for major maintenance work. Greenwood Yard, like other active TTC yards, operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Yard activity is minimal during the peak service periods when many trains are in revenue service. The yard is particularly busy in the evening and early morning hours to service and maintain the subway fleet after which the trains are put into position to go into service in the morning. History Prior to construction, most of the yard site used to be a clay quarry that later became Harper's Dump, Toronto's main landfill in the 1930s. The site also contained some residences which were demolished. In May 1965, the Greenwood Yard was put into partial service for some repair work. Heavy maintenance of subway bogies was transferred from the Hillcrest Complex to Greenwood. On February 26, 1966, the yard went into full service with the opening of Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth. When it opened, the yard had a railway siding and some four rail, dual gauge ( and ) track for the delivery of subway cars from the manufacturer. However, circa 2013, the TTC removed the standard gauge track to make more room for subway car storage. As of 2016, the standard gauge siding had been severed from both the yard and the railway mainline. Closeup of the former standard gauge siding between the yard and the railway mainline.

The subway yard services subway trains on Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity. The facility is located on Transit Rd. north of Wilson Ave, in the former city of North York (now part of Toronto), between Wilson and Sheppard West stations. The site is on a large parcel of land first was once part of Downsview Airport, built in 1936. During World War II the airport was turned into a military facility, most often known as Canadian Forces Base Downsview. The site became available to the TTC around the 1970s, after the federal government sold off part of the base lands as surplus. In 1974 the TTC considered interim expedients for storage of subway vehicles, until the Wilson Yard became available. The yard was completed in 1976 and began operations in 1977. The facility also houses a bus barn and maintenance facilities for subway cars. When Downsview (the original name of Sheppard West) station opened in 1996, a northern yard entry track to the extended mainline was constructed to provide better train access to the station, situated north of the yard. crossover By 2010, a tunnel was constructed to provide a link to a proposed northerly expansion of the yard to the mainline just south of Downsview station, though track was not laid and it was left dormant until the yard expansion project was completed in 2018. When it finally opened, this new link provided an entry/exit to the new northern section of the yard for trains servicing the Toronto‚ÄìYork Spadina Subway Extension. Since May 2018, trains going out of service at the Wilson Yard do so by deadheading southbound from Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station, instead of northbound from Wilson station. This avoids northbound trains going out of service after the evening rush hour having to cross the southbound track, which was the practice prior to this time. Modifications to the Wilson Yard were made to accommodate the new Toronto Rocket trains, the Toronto‚ÄìYork Spadina Subway Extension and increased demand on Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity. Work included expansion of the carhouse, a new hostler platform to support the new north-end entry/exit track, a new north-end runaround track connecting 8 new storage tracks in the west yard, a new power substation and a new training building with a simulator for TR trains. Opened in September 2018, the new hostler platform and north- end entry/exit track helps to reduce traffic delays by 44% in the early morning when work cars return from their night shift and service trains depart. Automatic train control is being added to all the TTC's heavy rail routes. Automatic Train Control was functional within the 60 acre Wilson Yard in 2019. Spokesmen said robot control of trains, within the yard, would increase safety and decrease delays.

Set in the US state of Georgia in the fictional town of Cold Sassy (based on the real city of Harmony Grove, now Commerce) in 1906, it follows the life of a 14-year-old boy named Will Tweedy, and explores themes such as religion, death, and social taboos. An incomplete sequel to the novel, Leaving Cold Sassy, was published in 1992 after Burns' death. Plot summary On July 5, 1906, Enoch Rucker Blakeslee announces that he intends to marry Miss Love Simpson, a milliner at his store who is years younger than he. This news shocks his family, since his wife Mattie Lou died only three weeks earlier. Rucker‚Äôs daughters, Mary Willis and Loma, worry about what the gossips of Cold Sassy will think of their father‚Äôs impropriety. Will Tweedy, Rucker‚Äôs 14-year-old grandson and the novel's narrator, supports his grandfather‚Äôs marriage. He thinks Miss Love is nice and pretty, although she comes from Baltimore and therefore is practically a Yankee. Will thinks Rucker needs someone to look after him now that Mattie Lou is gone. On the afternoon of Rucker and Miss Love's elopement, Will sneaks off to go fishing in the country, despite the fact that he is supposed to be in mourning for his grandmother. He walks across a high, narrow train trestle and nearly dies when a train speeds toward him. He survives by lying flat between the tracks so the train passes just overhead without touching him. Will becomes a sensation after his near-death experience, and the whole town comes to his house to ask him about the incident. Rucker shocks everyone by arriving with his new bride, Miss Love. The people of Cold Sassy disapprove of Rucker‚Äôs hasty marriage, and rumors spread quickly in the small town, but Will spends much time at the Blakeslee home and becomes friends with Miss Love. He likes her candid opinions and open personality. He also has a little crush on her and often spies on her. He soon learns that it's a marriage of convenience and that Rucker and Miss Love sleep in separate rooms. Miss Love tells Will that she married Rucker only because he promised to deed her the house and furniture. And Rucker married Miss Love to save on the cost of a housekeeper. Clayton McAllister, Miss Love‚Äôs former fianc√© from Texas, shows up one day and tries to persuade her to leave with him. He kisses her, but she sends him away contemptuously after kissing him. Will and some of his friends make a trip into the country to pick up a horse for Miss Love, camping in the mountains along the way. When they return, Will and his father Hoyt try to convince Will‚Äôs mother, Mary Willis, to travel to New York. Rucker has bought the tickets to New York so Hoyt, who works for him, can go to purchase new goods for the store. At first Mary Willis refuses to go because she is in mourning, but Will and Hoyt convince her that the trip will do her good. Right after she changes her mind, Rucker decides to use the tickets himself to go to New York with Miss Love. Mary Willis is crushed, and her hatred of Miss Love increases. To take his and Mary Willis‚Äô mind off the disappointment, Hoyt buys a brand-new Cadillac and becomes Cold Sassy's first car owner. Meanwhile, Rucker and Miss Love return from New York. They're now flirtatious and affectionate with each other, and Will wonders if their marriage is becoming more of a \\"real one.\\" Rucker announces that he too has bought a car and intends to start selling cars in Cold Sassy. Lightfoot McLendon is a classmate of Will‚Äôs who lives in the impoverished section of Cold Sassy known as Mill Town. One day Will takes Lightfoot on a car ride to the cemetery, where he kisses her. A nosy neighbor sees the kiss and tells Will‚Äôs parents. Outraged at Will‚Äôs association with common people, Will‚Äôs parents forbid him to drive the Cadillac for two months. Will gets around his punishment by driving Rucker‚Äôs car. One Sunday he, Rucker, and Miss Love take a day trip into the country, where Will gives them driving lessons. On the way back to Cold Sassy, as he tries to avoid a collision with a Ford wrecked in the middle of the road, Will crashes the car into a creek bed and damages the radiator. While they wait for a repair team, they stay with a nearby family. That night, Will overhears Rucker tell Miss Love that he loves her and wants their marriage to be real.

The company became independent in 1939, and currently has offices in more than 40 countries worldwide. Kearney has consistently earned top places among global management consulting firm rankings, such as Vault's Consulting 50 and Consulting magazine's \\"Best Firms to Work For.\\" In January 2020, the firm underwent a major rebranding and changed its name from A.T. Kearney to Kearney. Practice areas Kearney covers a wide range of industries and capabilities. Industry specialties include aerospace and defense, automotive, chemicals, communications media and technology, consumer products and retail, financial institutions, healthcare, metals and mining, oil and gas, private equity, public sector, transportation, and infrastructure and utilities. Major service lines are in strategy, analytics, mergers and acquisitions, innovation, operations, technology strategy, organization and transformation, marketing and sales, procurement, and sustainability. History The origins of the firm begin with Andrew Thomas Kearney, the first partner at McKinsey & Company. Kearney was hired in 1929 by James McKinsey. Upon McKinsey's sudden death in 1937, the remaining partners disagreed on how to best run the firm and by 1939, they had split into three organizations: Scovell, Wellington & Company, the accounting practice run by Oliver Wellington; McKinsey, Kearney & Company, the Chicago consulting office run by Tom Kearney; and McKinsey & Company, run by Marvin Bower. In 1947, Bower purchased the rights to the McKinsey name from Kearney, and Tom renamed the firm after himself, creating A.T. Kearney and Company. In 1972, the name was shortened to A.T. Kearney. In 1995, A.T. Kearney was acquired by EDS for $569M. The purchase of a successful management consultancy by an information technology services group was unprecedented, but financially successful, with Kearney's revenue tripling in five years to reach an industry-leading $1.3B by 2000. However, the firms experienced some culture clash: the Financial Times described A.T. Kearney's style as \\"individualistic\\" and \\"entrepreneurial\\", while EDS was \\"bureaucratic\\". These tensions peaked when Richard H. Brown became CEO in 1999, as he shed 13,000 jobs, reduced compensation, and consolidated back-office functions. It once again became an independent company in 2005. The firm opened its first international office in D√ºsseldorf, Germany in 1964. Its first office in Asia was opened in 1972, in Tokyo, Japan. Kearney established the Global Business Policy Council in 1992. The Council conducts research and analysis, and organizes an annual CEO Retreat. Attendees reportedly include prominent academic, corporate, and government thought leaders. Membership is by invitation only, and current members may veto the invitation of competitors.As of April 2016, Kearney operates 60 offices in 40 countries. According to Glassdoor, it is the highest-paying company for employees in the United States as of April 2017. In 2019, Kearney acquired Cervello, a business analytics and data management consultancy. Cervello's solution focus areas include enterprise performance management, data management, business intelligence and CRM. At the time of the acquisition, Cervello had offices in Boston, Dallas, New York, London and Bengaluru.  Recruitment  A 1999 survey ranked Kearney 6th out of 52 consulting firms in desirability. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the firm laid off new hires and delayed start dates. CEO Fred Steinberger characterized the move as \\"normal pruning\\", while student forums described it as a \\"bloodbath\\". In 2012, the career review site Glassdoor ranked Kearney as the 4th most difficult company to interview with.Giang, Vivian (July 27, 2012). \\"The 25 Hardest Companies For Job Interviews.\\" Business Insider.

The route runs southwest from downtown Boston along Tremont Street, ending at the Ruggles bus terminal and Orange Line transfer point. It is notable as the last streetcar service to use the since-covered-over Pleasant Street incline before its bustitution; until the new Southwest Corridor relocation of the southern Orange Line opened in May 1987, the route continued down Tremont Street and Columbus Avenue to Egleston (on the old Washington Street Elevated). History Route 43 trolleys at the Lenox Street loop in August 1956, two months after the loop became the new outbound terminus of the line Trackage along Tremont Street and Columbus Avenue was originally built in 1857 by the West Roxbury Railroad to provide service to Jamaica Plain (see Green Line \\"E\\" branch for more about that line). It used Tremont Street and Columbus Avenue from downtown to Centre Street. Soon afterward, in 1859, a branch of this line was built west along Tremont Street to Brookline (this later became part of the 66). The Tremont Street subway opened to the four-track Pleasant Street incline on October 1, 1897, and the western two tracks were connected to those running to the south along Tremont Street. However, between June 10, 1901, and November 29, 1908, the Main Line Elevated ran through the incline into the Tremont Street subway, and Tremont Street streetcars again ran along the surface; this ended when the Elevated gained its own tunnel under Washington Street in 1908, and the Tremont Street subway reverted to streetcar operation. At some time around then (after 1888), the tracks were extended the rest of the way to Egleston (and beyond, along Seaver Street). After March 1, 1953, the last day the to City Point ran, the 43 was shifted to the two eastern tracks to allow a bus transfer facility to be built where the western tracks had been. By this time, service ran to North Station, turning around on the lower-level loop at that station. Streetcars last ran to Egleston on June 14, 1956, after which they were cut back to Lenox Street, with a new bus route (also numbered 43) running between Lenox Street and Egleston. Service to Lenox Street ended on November 19, 1961, and the bus was extended north past the Pleasant Street incline to Boylston. A shuttle service was kept between the portal and Boylston, with one double-ended PCC streetcar on each track. This shuttle last ran April 5, 1962. On February 26, 1966, the 43 was cut back to Stuart Street due to the temporary closure of Tremont Street. This terminus was kept until June 1972, when service was extended north around Boston Common to Park Street. With the opening of the new southern portion of the Orange Line in May 1987, the south end of the 43 was truncated to Ruggles, with extensions of the and providing service between Ruggles and Egleston (the latter having been reduced to a bus stop with the closure of the Washington Street Elevated).

Rainbow Springs is the focal point of Rainbow Springs State Park. The spring formation is the fourth- largest in Florida, and produces over 490 million gallons of water daily. Rainbow Springs forms the headwaters of the Rainbow River, which empties into the Withlacoochee River.  History  Rainbow Springs was known as Wekiwa Creek by the Seminole Indians. Fishing for Mermaids in 1956 It was known as Blue Spring until the 1930s, when the site was developed as a tourist attraction and the promoter sought a more distinctive name (there are several other springs in Florida named \\"Wekiwa\\" and \\"Blue\\"). To compete with the \\"glass bottom boats\\" of nearby Silver Springs, Florida, submarine tours were given of the springs. As for some other Florida springs, such as Weeki Wachee Springs, \\"mermaid shows\\" were an attraction in the 1950s.

He has also contributed to a book entitled Fragile Earth: Views of a Changing World published by Collins, which presents before-and-after images of some of the natural changes which have happened to the world in recent years, including the Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, alongside a bleak look at the effects of mankind's actions on the planet. In January 2007, Lynas published Gem Carbon Counter,Collins, containing instructions to calculate people's personal carbon emissions and recommendations about how to reduce their impact on the atmosphere. In 2007, he published Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet, a book detailing the progressive effect of global warming in several planetary ecosystems, from 1 degree to 6 degrees and further of average temperature rise of the planet. Special coverage is given to the positive feedback mechanisms that could dramatically accelerate the climate change, possibly putting the climate on a runaway path. As a possible end scenario the release of methane hydrate from the bottom of the oceans could replicate the end-Permian extinction event. This book won the Royal Society's science book of the year award in 2008.Irvine, Lindesay (17 June 2008) Lynas's Six Degrees wins Royal Society award The Guardian, Retrieved 19 January 2012 In 2008, National Geographic released a documentary film based on Lynas's book, entitled Six Degrees Could Change the World. In 2010, Lynas published an article in the New Statesman entitled \\"Why We Greens Keep Getting It Wrong\\" and the same year was the main contributor to a UK Channel 4 Television programme called \\"What the Green Movement Got Wrong.\\" In these he explained that he now felt that several of his previous strongly held beliefs were wrong. For example, he suggested that opposition by environmentalists, such as himself, to the development of nuclear energy had speeded up climate change, and that GM crops were necessary to feed the world. This latter position was attacked as patronising and naive by some developing world commentators, including one featured in a Channel Four debate after the programme aired. A number of experts also criticised Lynas's factual errors in contributing to the film. British environmentalist George Monbiot wrote in the Guardian that '[Stewart] Brand and Lynas present themselves as heretics. But their convenient fictions chime with the thinking of the new establishment: corporations, thinktanks, neoliberal politicians. The true heretics are those who remind us that neither social nor environmental progress are possible unless power is confronted. Since writing this, George Monbiot is no longer opposed to nuclear power as an alternative to more polluting sources such as coal. In July 2011, Lynas published in the U.K. the book entitled The God Species: How the Planet Can Survive the Age of Humans. It was also published in the U.S. by National Geographic in October 2011 as The God Species: Saving the Planet in the Age of Humans (). Lynas argues that as Earth has entered the Anthropocene, and as such humanity is changing the planet's climate, its bio- geochemical cycles, the chemistry of the oceans and the colour of the sky, as well as reducing the number of species. Based on the planetary boundaries concept, he proposes several strategies that are controversial among the environmental community, such as using nuclear power and the Integral fast reactor to reduce carbon emissions and geoengineering to mitigate inevitable global warming; or genetic engineering (transgenics) to feed the world and reduce the environmental impact of agriculture. 16 July print edition pp. 86, In 2012, Mark Lynas was bestowed the Paradigm Award by the Breakthrough Institute in recognition of his intellectual leadership on the Anthropocene. =\\"In defence of nuclear power\\"= In January 2012, Lynas published an article titled In defence of nuclear power, in which he states that \\"nuclear provides the vast majority of the UK's current low-carbon electricity ‚Äì as much as 70%, whilst avoiding the emission of 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. This is why I want to see more nuclear power in the UK and elsewhere, in order to avoid more carbon emissions\\". In September 2012, Lynas wrote a follow-up article in the Guardian entitled \\"Without nuclear, the battle against global warming is as good as lost.\\" In 2013, Lynas published Nuclear 2.0: Why A Green Future Needs Nuclear Power. Lynas is featured in the 2013 pro-nuclear documentary film Pandora's Promise. Generation IV reactor research programs are developing the type of nuclear power described in Pandora's Promise. =Conversion to support GMOs= In a January 2013 lecture to the Oxford Farming Conference, Lynas detailed his conversion from an organizer of the anti-GMO food movement in Europe to becoming a supporter of the technology. He admitted \\"... in 2008, I was still penning screeds in the Guardian attacking the science of GM ‚Äì even though I had done no academic research on the topic, and had a pretty limited personal understanding.

The term G.I. has been used as an initialism of \\"Government Issue\\", \\"General Issue\\", or \\"Ground Infantry\\", but it originally referred to \\"galvanized iron\\", as used by the logistics services of the United States Armed Forces. During World War I, American soldiers sardonically referred to incoming German artillery shells as \\"G.I. cans\\". Also during that war, \\"G.I.\\" started being interpreted as \\"Government Issue\\" or \\"General Issue\\" for the general items of equipment of soldiers and airmen.

They Call Me Joe was a series of radio dramas aired in 1944. Each episode focused on a different fictional American soldier. A soldier of a different national or ethnic origin was selected for each episode, but he was always identified as a G. I. named Joe. The series was intended to encourage Americans of varying backgrounds to cooperate to win World War II. It was produced by the NBC University of the Air, which also produced a series The World's Great Novels. The series ran for twelve weeks and aired both on the NBC Radio Network and the Armed Forces Radio Network. ‚ÄùG.I. Joe‚Äù, an action figure, was introduced by Hasbro in 1964.

It is the administrative center of Radyvyliv Raion (district), and is located south-west of the oblast capital, Rivne, near European route E40. The nearest larger cities are Dubno, and Brody; the latter being away. In Soviet times, from 1939 to 1992, the city was known as Chervonoarmiysk (, ). History In the 14th century, together with whole Volhynia, Radyvyliv was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Following the 1569 Union of Lublin, the town was transferred to the Kingdom of Poland, where it remained for over 200 years. As a result of the Partitions of Poland, Radziwi≈Ç≈Çow, as it was called, became a town of the Kremenetsky Uyezd in the Volhynian Governorate of the Russian Empire. In the late 1800s, the Jewish population reached 4,000. Between World War I and the civil war between Ukrainian nationalists and Bolsheviks, the Jewish population declined to around 2,000. During the January Uprising, a unit of Jozef Wysocki operated in the area of Radyvyliv. After World War I, the town returned to Poland, and was part of Dubno County, Volhynian Voivodeship. Its residents were Jewish (50%), Ukrainian (31%), and Polish (17%). During the Volhynian Genocide, ethnic Poles from villages in the area fled to the town, to escape Ukrainian nationalists. Almost all those who survived the slaughter left Radyvyliv, and settled in the People's Republic of Poland‚Äôs Recovered Territories.

Generate a distribution of 2D points centered around that point, where the x and y coordinates are chosen independently from a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation œÉ (blue region). If R is the distance from these points to the origin, then R has a Rice distribution. In probability theory, the Rice distribution or Rician distribution (or, less commonly, Ricean distribution) is the probability distribution of the magnitude of a circularly-symmetric bivariate normal random variable, possibly with non-zero mean (noncentral). It was named after Stephen O. Rice. Characterization The probability density function is : f(x\\\\mid u,\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sigma^2}\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-(x^2+ u^2)} {2\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right)I_0\\\\left(\\\\frac{x u}{\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right), where I0(z) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind with order zero. In the context of Rician fading, the distribution is often also rewritten using the Shape Parameter K = \\\\frac{ u^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}, defined as the ratio of the power contributions by line-of-sight path to the remaining multipaths, and the Scale parameter \\\\Omega = u^2+2\\\\sigma^2 , defined as the total power received in all paths.Abdi, A. and Tepedelenlioglu, C. and Kaveh, M. and Giannakis, G., \\"On the estimation of the K parameter for the Rice fading distribution\\", IEEE Communications Letters, March 2001, p. 92‚Äì94 The characteristic function of the Rice distribution is given as:Liu 2007 (in one of Horn's confluent hypergeometric functions with two variables).Annamalai 2000 (in a sum of infinite series). : \\\\begin{align} \\\\chi_X(t\\\\mid u,\\\\sigma) = \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{ u^2}{2\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right) & \\\\left[ \\\\Psi_2 \\\\left( 1; 1, \\\\frac{1}{2}; \\\\frac{ u^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}, -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2 t^2 \\\\right) \\\\right. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & \\\\left. {} + i \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\sigma t \\\\Psi_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{3}{2}; 1, \\\\frac{3}{2}; \\\\frac{ u^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}, -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2 t^2 \\\\right) \\\\right], \\\\end{align} where \\\\Psi_2 \\\\left( \\\\alpha; \\\\gamma, \\\\gamma'; x, y \\\\right) is one of Horn's confluent hypergeometric functions with two variables and convergent for all finite values of x and y.

When k is even, the raw moments become simple polynomials in œÉ and ŒΩ, as in the examples above. For the case q = 1/2: : \\\\begin{align} L_{1/2}(x) &=\\\\,_1F_1\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2};1;x\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= e^{x/2} \\\\left[\\\\left(1-x\\\\right)I_0\\\\left(-\\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right) -xI_1\\\\left(-\\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right) \\\\right]. \\\\end{align} The second central moment, the variance, is :\\\\mu_2= 2\\\\sigma^2+ u^2-(\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2/2)\\\\,L^2_{1/2}(- u^2/2\\\\sigma^2) .

It is seen that as ŒΩ becomes large or œÉ becomes small the mean becomes ŒΩ and the variance becomes œÉ2. The transition to a Gaussian approximation proceeds as follows.

In the first two methods the interest is in estimating the parameters of the distribution, ŒΩ and œÉ, from a sample of data. This can be done using the method of moments, e.g., the sample mean and the sample standard deviation. The sample mean is an estimate of Œº1' and the sample standard deviation is an estimate of Œº21/2. The following is an efficient method, known as the \\"Koay inversion technique\\".Koay et al. 2006 (known as the SNR fixed point formula). for solving the estimating equations, based on the sample mean and the sample standard deviation, simultaneously . This inversion technique is also known as the fixed point formula of SNR. Earlier worksAbdi 2001 on the method of moments usually use a root-finding method to solve the problem, which is not efficient. First, the ratio of the sample mean to the sample standard deviation is defined as r, i.e., r=\\\\mu^{'}_1/\\\\mu^{1/2}_2. The fixed point formula of SNR is expressed as : g(\\\\theta) = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\xi{(\\\\theta)} \\\\left[ 1+r^2\\\\right] - 2}, where \\\\theta is the ratio of the parameters, i.e., \\\\theta = \\\\frac{ u}{\\\\sigma}, and \\\\xi{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} is given by: : \\\\xi{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} = 2 + \\\\theta^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{8} \\\\exp{(-\\\\theta^2/2)}\\\\left[ (2+\\\\theta^2) I_0 (\\\\theta^2/4) + \\\\theta^2 I_1(\\\\theta^{2}/4)\\\\right]^2, where I_0 and I_1 are modified Bessel functions of the first kind. Note that \\\\xi{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} is a scaling factor of \\\\sigma and is related to \\\\mu_{2} by: : \\\\mu_2 = \\\\xi{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} \\\\sigma^2.\\\\, To find the fixed point, \\\\theta^{*} , of g , an initial solution is selected, {\\\\theta}_{0} , that is greater than the lower bound, which is {\\\\theta}_{\\\\mathrm{lower bound}} = 0 and occurs when r = \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi/(4-\\\\pi)} (Notice that this is the r=\\\\mu^{'}_1/\\\\mu^{1/2}_2 of a Rayleigh distribution). This provides a starting point for the iteration, which uses functional composition, and this continues until \\\\leftg^{i}\\\\left(\\\\theta_{0}\\\\right)-\\\\theta_{i-1}\\\\right is less than some small positive value. Here, g^{i} denotes the composition of the same function, g, i times. In practice, we associate the final \\\\theta_{n} for some integer n as the fixed point, \\\\theta^{*}, i.e., \\\\theta^{*} = g\\\\left(\\\\theta^{*}\\\\right). Once the fixed point is found, the estimates u and \\\\sigma are found through the scaling function, \\\\xi{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} , as follows: : \\\\sigma = \\\\frac{\\\\mu^{1/2}_2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\xi\\\\left(\\\\theta^{*}\\\\right)}}, and : u = \\\\sqrt{\\\\left( \\\\mu^{'~2}_1 + \\\\left(\\\\xi\\\\left(\\\\theta^{*}\\\\right) - 2\\\\right)\\\\sigma^2 \\\\right)}. To speed up the iteration even more, one can use the Newton's method of root-finding. This particular approach is highly efficient.

It is a methodology which treats its objects of study and its students, that is, humans, as composites of values and systems of values. In certain contexts, the term is related to other sociological domains such as antipositivism. Humanistic sociology seeks to shed light on questions such as, \\"What is the relationship between a man of principle and a man of opportunism?\\" Origins Humanistic sociology is a domain of sociology that grew from antipositivism. It originated from the initial work of Florian Witold Znaniecki and W. I. Thomas who co-authored The Polish Peasant in Europe and America.Thomas, William and Florian Znaniecki, ed. Eli Zaretsky (1996). The Polish Peasant in Europe and America: A Classic Work in Immigration History. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. Thomas, due to his multi-ethnic background, was fluent in Polish. He developed the life-history methodology,Znaniecki, F. (1934). The Method of Sociology. New York: Farrar & Rinehart. where data is obtained from letters and other materials, such as the archives of the Polish Emigrants Protective Association, of which Znaniecki was a director. Znaniecki was a philosopher who opposed idealism and naturalism, proposing instead a methodology for social research based around the \\"humanistic coefficient\\", sometimes known as the humanist principle. The outbreak of World War I led Znaniecki to join Thomas at Chicago. Unfortunately for Thomas, he encountered political problems, ending his career as an academic. However, he went on to produce important works at the New School for Social Research, working with other notable scholars, such as Harold Laski. As a result, his role in the origins of Humanistic sociology is often understated. Znaniecki went on to a distinguished academic career, taking the chair of sociology at the University of Poznan where he founded the Polish Sociological Institute. Fortunately for Znaniecki, at the outbreak of World War II, he was a visiting professor at Columbia University. Thus, he was spared the tragic history of his motherland.Davies, Norman (2004). Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw. Viking Books. He became a professor at the University of Illinois, where he stayed until his death in 1958. His mantle passed to his gifted student, Stanis≈Çaw Ossowski, who revived the Polish Sociological Institute after it had been liquidated by Stalinist authorities in 1951 (as the Polish Sociological Association). Ossowski maintained the noted and considerable resistance by Znaniecki to the \\"ideological control of science\\".Connelly, John (December 1996). \\"Internal bolshevisation? Elite social science training in stalinist Poland\\" Minerva, vol. 34, no. 4. The principle of analytic induction Analytic induction is a method of social research that is inductive, where theories and concepts are modified as a result of doing research (see scientific method). The philosophical foundations of analytic induction originate from Aristotle and his concept of induction. Analytic induction can be thought of as a phenomenological process, that is the phenomena cannot occur or be understood separate from the process. Similar to the Socratic Method or Karl Popper's falsification, the researcher sets out to disprove his theory by maximizing the chance of producing negative evidence. Analytic induction was Znaniecki's answer to the problem of induction. Znaniecki believed analytic induction was a new process for conducting social research that is capable of universal and precise results. Structuralism vs Functionalism There is a debate between two competing schools of sociological thought, Structuralism and Functionalism. This debate is inherited from the European philosophical roots of humanistic sociology: Husserl's attempt via reflexion to extract the essence of experience as opposed to Heidegger's existential phenomenology. While each school lays claim to legitimate theory, each leads to quite different approaches when interpreting the results of research and developing conclusions. The genesis of the debate relates to the primacy of the Conceptual objects involved. Does a researcher consider the structural objects and their relation to the system as a priority, or does the researcher consider the function of the object as the priority? The problems found in each school will lead to static analysis. =Structuralism= Znaniecki's model was derived independently of Max Weber and √âmile Durkheim. The concept of agency derived by Claude L√©vi-Strauss provided the foundations for structuralism and the later work of sociologists such as Pierre Bourdieu. Structuralists influenced by humanistic sociology will interpret data in terms of opposing valuations, contrasts, and relations. Interpretation of the data must be contextual. Structuralism allows for a realist analysis (structures represent an organized reality) in relation to the larger social system. By understanding the larger social system, you are differentiating from post-modernism, which seeks to describe society by its lack of structure, or fragmentation. =Functionalism= Functionalists seek an objective understanding of the social world. They have a more positivist view of social science, believing objective results can be obtained by techniques like surveys and interviews. They discount the inherent bias of the intellectual, believing their results are value-free. Functionalism grew from the work of Max Weber and √âmile Durkheim. Functionalism was popular in the US during the period from 1930 to 1960. Humanistic sociology had a role in the decline of functionalism. This can be seen in the rise of later models which returned to a focus of the subjective nature of human experience, for example, the later popularity of post-modern thinking highlighting the subjective basis of semantics. Humanistic sociology also differentiates itself from functionalism in promoting the need for freedom of thinking in the practices of research. Functionalists reject the idea of a realist or structural analysis, seeking instead a more observable explanation with external validation outside the social system. =Structural functionalism= Some functionalists actually regard themselves as proponents of structural functionalism. Structural functionalism is close to humanistic sociology in its understanding of society as shared norms and values. Structural functionalism arose from functionalism in the attempt to explain the dominance of some social groups over others, known as conflict theory. Conflict theory contradicts functionalism. Structural functionalism is usually associated with the work of Talcott Parsons. Again humanistic sociology had a role in the decline of structural functionalism. In the humanistic model, there exist dynamical systems of values obtained from social actions in an evolutionary sense. =Symbolic interactionism= Many will claim that symbolic interactionism has grown directly from the work of Thomas and Znaniecki. Symbolic interactionism grew out of structural functionalism. Symbolic interactionism views society as consisting of interactions among individuals. Hence the focus on individuals and the organization and patterns found in their everyday activities. It seeks to deal with problems like identity. Problems found in symbolic interactionism, such as inadequate analysis of social structure, led to a fork in the road of social science. The school of sociology most influenced by the humanistic model developed by Znaniecki and Thomas led to the development of ethnomethodology. The other branch led to post-modernism via poststructuralism. =Ethnomethodology= Ethnomethodology and the social anthropology of Pierre Bourdieu are probably the best representation of the initial work of Znaniecki and his model of culture as a system of values. In a sense humanistic sociology has transcended the structure vs function debate, focusing instead on the value-based world of culture. A researcher working as a humanistic sociologist has a scientific objectification of values. Using analytic induction in the context of the humanistic coefficient, not unduly influenced by questions of structure or function, an objective order for the social world is found. That the character of this social world is derived from sociological sources does not discount a scientific conclusion. A humanistic sociologist models the experience of humanity as the span of social action. A humanistic sociologist derives a dual structure for this space from axiological constructions mapped by symbolic expressions. A humanistic sociologist will follow the path pointed to by Znaniecki and reject the naturalistic view. =Post-modernism= Post- modernism, by its emphasis on subjectivity, implies that no one set of values is any better than any other (This is criticised by some as moral relativism). It is however quite possible to equate a scientific analysis of value systems with post-modernism. The analysis of globalisation is one such application of the analysis within post-modernism. By a focus on the subjective nature of experience, a humanistic sociologist can be a post-modern thinker. However a humanistic sociologist has core values and beliefs with which it is possible to assign a positive or negative evaluation to a value, for example, the priority of the \\"inner dignity of man\\".Znaniecki, F. (1986). The Social Role of the Man of Knowledge. New Brunswick: Transaction Books. Just as in the practices of humanistic research or humanistic social work,Payne, M. (2011). Humanistic Social Work, Core Principles in Practice. Chicago: Lyceum, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan.Stefaroi, Petru. (2014). Humane & Spiritual Qualities of the Professional in Humanistic Social Work: Humanistic Social Work - The Third Way in Theory and Practice, Charleston: Createspace, USA. a value is positive to the extent that it leads to creative and constructive social activity.Znaniecki, F. (1983). Cultural Reality. Houston, Texas: Cap and Gown Press. It is therefore wrong to equate post-modernism with humanistic sociology, which above all seeks an irreducible representation of the human world.

History An empty and closed GNC store in June 2020 GNC world headquarters on Wood Street, Pittsburgh In 1935, David Shakarian opened a small health food store, Lackzoom, in downtown Pittsburgh. He made US$35 on his first day and was able to open a second store within six months. A year later, Shakarian suffered from what appeared to be a fatal blow when the Ohio River flooded into downtown on St. Patrick's Day. Both of his stores were wiped out. But he opened a new store the next year and later began a mail-order business, shipping health foods and later vitamins and prescription drugs throughout the country. Major expansion began in the 1960s. Shakarian said the physical fitness movement, anxiety about smoking and the growth shopping centers brought success to his business venture. In the 1960s, the company changed the name of its outlets to General Nutrition Centers. He stepped down as chief executive officer in February 1984 but continued as chairman until his death later that year. Shakarian took GNC public (listed on the NYSE) in the 1980s. Gary Daum was named chief executive office in February 1984. In May 1985, Jerry Horn took on the role. In 1990 the company considered relocating but a public/private effort retained GNC headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh. GNC was taken private and sold to Thomas H. Lee Partners a PE investment/management fund in the late 1980s. Thomas Lee ran GNC and took it public prior to selling the company to Royal Dutch Numico and Numico acquired GNC in 1999; it sold GNC to Apollo Management in 2003. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Ares Management bought GNC in 2007. GNC went public in 2011. In 2018, the Chinese state-owned Harbin Pharmaceutical Group agreed to acquire an approximately 40% stake in GNC. In September 2020, Senator Marco Rubio asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to examine the proposed acquisition on data protection and national security grounds. In June 2019, the company announced they would be shuttering 900 mall locations in 2020 due to slumping sales. In June 2020, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and indicated plans to close at least 800 stores. Effective on June 30, 2020, the stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and shifted to the OTC Pink market. In September 2020, the bankruptcy court in Delaware approved the sale of GNC for $770 million to Harbin Pharmaceutical Group. Retail stores Promenade Ypsilanti Twp., MI GNC stores typically stock a wide range of weight loss, bodybuilding, nutritional supplements, vitamins, natural remedies, and health and beauty products, in both its owned brands as well as third-party brands. As of December 31, 2018, GNC had approximately 8,400 locations, of which approximately 6,200 retail locations are in the United States (including approximately 2,200 Rite Aid licensed store-within-a-store locations) and franchise operations in approximately 50 countries. In July 2019, it was announced that GNC plans to close up to 1,400 company owned retail locations, primarily those located within shopping malls. Business model Of GNC's approximately 4,100 U.S. locations, 61% are in strip centers and 28% are in malls. GNC products are available on GNC.com, and as of January 2017 are also available on GNC's Amazon Marketplace. Lawsuits In 1998, GNC was accused of purposely running its franchisees out of business in order to \\"retake\\" the stores into corporate control. An April 30, 2003 article states that the GNC corporate company was sued by numerous franchise owners. The complaint is that the parent company was allowing their corporate owned stores to sell products for less than the franchise stores are allowed to sell them for. The suit also claimed that GNC charged high \\"reset fees\\" to franchisees when there is new signage that needs to be changed in the store or an image facelift that must be done by GNC corporate. A similar lawsuit was filed again in an article written on October 20, 2004. In February 2015, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent cease and desist letters to GNC and other major retailers due to concerning laboratory tests regarding the accuracy of the claimed contents of supplements. GNC shortly afterwards removed some stock from sales while working with the Attorney General. In September 2016, GNC, the New York Office of the Attorney General, and other supplement retailers ultimately came to an agreement and retailers are now accomplishing more robust testing of supplements to ensure accurate labeling. In October 2015, the Attorney General of Oregon filed a lawsuit against GNC alleging that the company knowingly sold products containing the ingredients picamilon and BMPEA, which are banned by the FDA. On February 2, 2017, GNC threatened to sue the Fox Broadcasting Company for \\"significant economic and reputational damages, lost opportunities, and consequential damages\\", after an advertisement for the chain was blocked from airing during Super Bowl LI. Despite repeated approvals by Fox, the network stated that the ad had been vetoed by the National Football League because of GNC's placement on an NFLPA blacklist for selling products that contain substances banned by the NFL. The letter of intent claimed that Fox had not informed them of any such rules when they purchased the ad time, and cited that the purchase induced them to \\"spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign\\" around the commercial. The NFL itself does not prohibit ads for health stores unless they contain references to specific prohibited products; the GNC ad only contained motivational themes and no references to its products.

Background The defeat of Little Crow in the Dakota War of 1862 caused the widespread dispersion of the Santee Sioux or Eastern Dakota. Of the 6,300 Santee, 2,000 were taken prisoner. About 700 of the Lower Sioux from the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute bands remained at large. Most of the 4,000 Upper Sioux from the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands, who had been reluctant participants in the war, also remained free. A few of these refugees from the war fled to Canada, but more than 4,000 congregated in the summer of 1863 in a large encampment in present-day Kidder County, North Dakota. They were joined in the camp by an unknown, but probably sizeable, number of their Teton, Yankton, and Yanktonai relatives.Clodfelter, pp 88-95 Despite the defeat, however, Santee raids continued in 1863, resulting in more than a dozen white deaths in Minnesota. To protect the frontier, Henry Hastings Sibley, appointed brigadier general of volunteers, was ordered by his superior, General John Pope, to lead a military expedition to punish the Santee. On June 16 Sibley departed from near Fort Ridgely and marched into the Dakota Territory. His army initially numbered 3,320 men, the largest military force ever assembled to combat Indians.Clodfelter, pp. 71, 90 Sibley's ponderous column proceeded very slowly northwestward, hampered by drought, heat, and a lack of potable water. After a month of travel without having seen a single Indian, Sibley was informed by a group of buffalo hunters, mostly M√©tis Chippewa, of the location of a large Santee encampment of 600 lodges. With a stripped-down army of 2,056 men ‚Äì 1,436 infantry, 520 cavalry, and 100 artillery plus 60 mixed blood and Sioux scouts ‚Äì Sibley located the Santee encampment on July 24.http://oyate1.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=census&action;=print&thread;=468, accessed 26 Feb 2012 He halted nearby and sent scout and interpreter Joseph LaFramboise, one-half Sioux, to the Indian camp to propose a meeting with Upper Sioux leader Standing Buffalo.http://michellesfamilytree.com/grpf9263.html , accessed 24 Mar 2012 Sibley believed, probably correctly, that Standing Buffalo and his followers favored peace with the whites.Clodfelter, pp. 94-95 However, Inkpaduta, believed to be implacably hostile to whites, and his band were also in the Indian camp.Larson, Peggy Rodina. \\"A New Look at the Elusive Indpaduta.\\" Minnesota History. Vol. 48, No.1 (Spring 1982), p. 34 Battle Anticipating a meeting between Sibley and Standing Buffalo, a group of Sioux and Sibley's scouts gathered peacefully on a hill, called Big Mound, 300 to 400 yards from Sibley's camp. An army surgeon, Dr. Josiah S. Weiser, approached Big Mound to greet several Indian friends, but was suddenly shot and killed by Tall Crown, a follower of Inkpaduta. The scouts and the Sioux opened fire on each other and the battle began.Clodfelter, p. 95 Sibley estimated that he faced 1,000 to 1,500 Indian warriors. They took cover behind hills and in ravines. Sibley sent forward two companies of Mounted Rangers to drive the Indians away from Big Mound and supported them with more soldiers and a six-pounder cannon. On reaching the top of Big Mound, Sibley could see the Indian warriors retreating, guarding the women and children of the Indian camp fleeing westward with their possessions.United States War Department. The War of the Rebellion: A compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. Series 1, Vol. 22, p. 354 The Santee were poorly armed. Only about one half had firearms and those had little ammunition.Clodfelter, pp. 97-98 Several hundred of the Mounted Rangers pursued the Indian warriors, protecting the flight of their women and children, until nightfall. Most of Sibley's infantry devoted themselves to destroying the large quantities of jerky, buffalo robes, cooking utensils, and other goods left behind by the Sioux in their hasty flight.United States War Department, pp 354-355 Sibley intended for the Rangers to continue the pursuit of the Sioux the next day, camping where they were for the night. However, by a mistaken order, the Rangers were ordered instead to return to their base, 12 miles from where they were. They arrived exhausted and Sibley was forced to rest his soldiers and horses the next day, July 25, before continuing his pursuit on July 26. Sibley's casualties for the day were three dead and four wounded. In Sibley's official report he estimated that 80 Indians had been killed and wounded, but his diary said that only 9 were killed.Clodfelter, p. 99-100, 111 Results The Sioux seemed to have little stomach to fight Sibley. Standing Buffalo may have surrendered his followers en masse if not for the killing of the army surgeon which precipitated this battle, The Battles of Dead Buffalo Lake and Stony Lake soon followed as Sibley pursued the Sioux westward.

It is the oldest mosque in Egypt as well as the whole of Africa surviving in its full original form, and is the largest mosque in Cairo in terms of land area. Since Ibn Tulun Mosque has much open space, it boasts both sunlight and shadows. It is built around an open square courtyard which allows natural light to travel through. Ibn Tulun Mosque features Samarra style - its decorations being created from carved stucco and wood. This mosque is a popular tourist attraction. Construction history Aerial view The mosque was commissioned by the Turkic ruler Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Abbasid governor of Egypt from 868‚Äì884 whose rule was characterized by de facto independence. It was designed by the prominent Egyptian architect, Saiid Ibn Kateb Al-Farghany, who was a Christian Orthodox, the same engineer who designed the Nilometer. The historian al-Maqrizi lists the mosque's construction start date as 876 AD,al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´, Khi·π≠a·π≠, II, pp. 265 ff. and the mosque's original inscription slab identifies the date of completion as . The mosque was constructed on a small hill called Gebel Yashkur, \\"The Hill of Thanksgiving.\\" One local legend says that it is here that Noah's Ark came to rest after the Deluge, rather than at Mount Ararat.R.G. 'John' Gayer-Anderson Pasha. \\"Legends of the House of the Cretan Woman.\\" Cairo and New York: American University in Cairo Press, 2001. pp. 33‚Äì34. and Nicholas Warner. \\"Guide to the Gayer-Anderson Museum in Cairo.\\" Cairo: Press of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, 2003. p. 5.The mosque has been used for several purposes. One such purpose is it was used as a shelter for pilgrims from North Africa to the Hijaz in the 12th century. The grand congregational mosque was intended to be the focal point of Ibn Tulun's capital, al-Qata'i, which served as the center of administration for the Tulunid dynasty. Originally the mosque backed onto Ibn Tulun's palace, and a door next to the minbar allowed him direct entry to the mosque. Al-Qata'i was razed in the early 10th century AD, and the mosque is the only surviving structure. Geometric arch decorations - The floral representations and geometric designs on the arches reflects abbasid art. The mosque was constructed in the Samarran style common with Abbasid constructions. It is constructed around a courtyard, with one covered hall on each of the four sides, the largest being on the side of the qibla, or direction of Mecca. The original mosque had a fountain (fauwara) in the middle of the sahn, covered a gilt dome supported by ten marble columns, and round it were 16 marble columns and a marble pavement. Under the dome there was a great basin of marble 4 cubits in diameter with a jet of marble in the centre. A distinctive sabil with a high drum dome was added in the central courtyard at the end of the thirteenth century by Mamluk Sultan Lajin instead of the \\"fauwara\\". (see also Chahartaq (architecture)) = Interior = The interior ceiling of Ibn Tulun mosque is composed of sycamore wood. The interior arched windows provides natural light against the hollow dome. Each pointed arch has a window and is designed with plain geometric design.Inscription at main entrance having mention of Fatimid =Minaret= The spiral minaret It is modeled after the minarets of Samarra, with a spiral staircase around the outside. There is significant controversy over the date of construction of the minaret, which features a helical outer staircase. It is also told that using these stairs one can climb up on a horse. Legend has it that Ibn Tulun himself was accidentally responsible for the design of the structure: supposedly while sitting with his officials, he absentmindedly wound a piece of parchment around his finger. When someone asked him what he was doing, he responded, embarrassed, that he was designing his minaret. Many of the architectural features, however, point to a later construction, in particular the way in which the minaret does not connect well with the main mosque structure, something that would have been averted had the minaret and mosque been built at the same time. Architectural historian Doris Behrens-Abouseif asserts that Sultan Lajin, who restored the mosque in 1296, was responsible for the construction of the current minaret. The minaret shows influences from both the Lighthouse of Alexandria and the famous minaret in Samarra. Main mihrab of Ibn Tulun mosque in the centre of qibla wall. Made of marble, stucco, brick, and different colored mosaics. The muslim profession of faith is inscripted in Kufic calligraphy. The columns are made of gray marble. It is built entirely of well-fired red brick, plaster, and carved stucco. Stucco is cement-based plaster that is mixed on-site and applied wet which hardens to a very dense solid. The mosque is also built from this material. The staircase extends up to the tower 170 feet in height. =Prayer niches= The architectural elements inside of the mosque contains a prayer niche (mihrab) and a wooden minbar. The hood of the mihrab has the date of the completed construction inscripted in Kufic script. There are six prayer niches (mihrab) at the mosque, five of which are flat as opposed to the main concave niche. It indicates the qibla which the profession of faith inscripted in Kufic calligraphy. * The main niche is situated in the centre of the qibla wall and is the tallest of the six. It was redecorated under Sultan Lajin and contains a top of painted wood, the shahada in a band of glass mosaics and a bottom of marble panels. * The same qibla wall features a smaller niche to the left of the main niche. Its stalactite work and naskhi calligraphy indicate an early Mamluk origin. * The two prayer niches on the piers flanking the dikka are decorated in the Samrarran style, with one niche containing a unique medallion with a star hanging from a chain. The Kufic shahada inscriptions on both niches do not mention Ali and were thus made before the Shi'a Fatimids came to power. * The westernmost prayer niche, the mihrab of al-Afdal Shahanshah, is a replica of an original kept at Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art. It is ornately decorated in a style with influences from Persia. The Kufic inscription mentions the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir, on whose orders the niche was made, as well as the Shi'a shahada including Ali as God's wali after declaring the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad. * On the pier to the left are the remains of a copy of al-Afdal's mihrab. It differs, however, by referring to Sultan Lajin instead of al-Mustansir, and a lack of Ali's name. File:Ibn-Tulun-Moschee 2015-11-14i.jpgMain prayer niche.

Most were demolished in 1928 by the Committee for the Conservation of Arab Monuments, however, two of the oldest and best-preserved homes were left intact. The \\"house of the Cretan woman\\" (Bayt al-Kritliyya) and the Beit Amna bint Salim, were originally two separate structures, but a bridge at the third floor level was added at some point, combining them into a single structure. The house, accessible through the outer walls of the mosque, is open to the public as the Gayer-Anderson Museum, named after the British general R.G. 'John' Gayer-Anderson, who lived there until 1942. Built in a busy area, the topography of this place consists of several houses built against the outside walls of the mosque. The ziyada or empty space between the walls is approximately 26,318 sq m Outside the mosque you can see several houses were built up against the outside walls of the mosque. The topography of the mosque is surrounded by a very busy city. Restoration The mosque has been restored several times. The first known restoration was in 1077 under orders of the Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali. Sultan Lajin's restoration of 1296 added several improvements. The mosque was most recently restoredhttps://archnet.org/sites/6096 by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities in 2004. In popular culture Parts of the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me were filmed at the mosque. The mosque is featured in the game Serious Sam 3: BFE, forming a significant part of the game's third level. It is also featured in a level of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, where Lara Croft has to trap a minotaur inside the mosque.

Smith, who became president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Early life Mary Fielding was born in Honeydon (Honidon), Bedfordshire, England, on July 21, 1801. She was the sixth child of John Fielding and Rachel Ibbotson, who were active in the growing Methodist movement in the area. In 1834, Mary emigrated to join her brother Joseph and her sister Mercy in Toronto, Upper Canada. Joining the Latter Day Saint church The three Fielding siblings were introduced to the Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1836 by their good friend. John Taylor. Taylor and his wife were in the same congregation as the Fieldings, all of whom were \\"disenchanted Methodists\\". On a trip to Toronto, John Taylor came in contact with LDS missionary Parley P. Pratt and shortly after brought Pratt to meet the Fieldings. They were baptized on May 21, 1836 in a creek near their home. Mary, John, and Mercy moved to Kirtland, Ohio, the following spring to join the larger body of the church. Family and later years left Well educated, Mary earned a living through teaching school, tutoring private pupils and acting as a governess. At the suggestion of the church's president, Joseph Smith, the recently widowed Hyrum Smith courted Mary Fielding and the couple married on December 24, 1837. Mary accepted the responsibility of caring for and raising Hyrum's children from his first marriage, including the future church patriarch John Smith. In March 1838, Hyrum was among the church leaders taken to prison by the Missouri militia. At this time, Smith was pregnant with her first child, Joseph. Smith went to Quincy, Illinois, with the remaining church members and, after Hyrum escaped from jail, they moved to Nauvoo, Illinois (also known as Commerce). Their second child, Martha, was born in Illinois. After Hyrum was killed in 1844, Smith chose to follow the direction of Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. She and her family were among the poorer church members driven out of Nauvoo in the fall of 1846, who experienced the incident later known as the \\"miracle of the quails\\". She went to Winter Quarters and then on to the Salt Lake Valley. One story recounts Smith's trip across the plains with Heber C. Kimball's pioneer company. One of the captains, Cornelius P. Lott, questioned her preparation and suggested she stay behind and wait for others to help her: he called her a burden to the whole company. In response, Smith said that she would not only stay with the company but would arrive in the Salt Lake Valley before Lott and without any of his help. She reportedly arrived in the Valley one day before Lott.\\"Cornelius P. Lott\\". www.saintswithouthalos.com. http://www.saintswithouthalos.com/b/lott_cp.phtml. Accessed 9 May 2007. She would eventually marry Heber C. Kimball. Death Mary Fielding Smith House in Salt Lake City Utah Mary Fielding Smith and Mercy Fielding Thompson's grave markers On September 21, 1852, Smith died in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, at the home of her second husband, Heber C. Kimball, apparently of pneumonia. She was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. Although she was widely known and respected during her lifetime, her son, Joseph F. Smith, further enhanced her reputation after her death as he presented her as a role model of courage and faithfulness in public addresses, sermons and articles.

It was written mainly between 1911 and 1914, but with sketches dating as far back as 1903 and last revisions made in 1929. The work is celebrated for its use of musical quotation and paraphrasing. The movements (in Ives's preferred slow-fast-slow sequence, longest first and shortest last) are: Lasting just under twenty minutes, Three Places in New England has become one of Ives's most performed compositions. It exhibits signature traits of his style: layered textures with multiple, sometimes simultaneous melodies, many of which are recognizable hymn or marching tunes; masses of sound, including tone clusters; and sudden, sharp textural contrasts. Each ‚Äúplace‚Äù is in New England. Each is intended to make the listener experience a unique atmosphere, as if there. To this end, the paraphrasing of American folk tunes is an important device, providing tangible reference points and making the music accessible despite its avant-garde chromaticism. Three Places in New England aims to paint a picture of American ideals, lifestyle and patriotism at the turn of the 20th century. History = Composition = Three Places in New England was composed between 1903 and 1929. The set was completed in 1914 but was later revised for performance in 1929. The second piece, Putnam‚Äôs Camp, Redding, Connecticut was created from two short theater orchestra pieces composed by Ives in 1903. These pieces, \\"Country Band\\" March and Overture & March: \\"1776\\", were completed in 1904. Lyman Brewster, Ives' uncle, had asked him to compose the pieces for his play Major John Andre which was never performed due to Brewster's untimely death. In the early fall of 1912, Ives began tinkering with these compositions again. The satisfaction that Ives derived from working on the Fourth of July (the third movement of his Holiday Symphony), in which he used the trio (or middle) section of 1776, may have been the catalyst for inspiring him to reuse these lost songs and create a longer piece. By October, Ives had completed an ink score-sketch of Putnam's Camp. The final version of the piece clearly resembles its source materials, but many of the complex musical jokes that littered the originals had been replaced with simpler alternatives. The Housatonic at Stockbridge, the third piece in the set, was composed in 1911 along with the opening movement. By 1912, after finishing Putnam's Camp, Ives had settled on the form of a three-movement orchestral set and had written the majority of it. = Premiere and publication = In 1929, Nicolas Slonimsky, conductor of the Boston Chamber Orchestra at that time, contacted Ives about the possibility of performing Three Places. Slonimsky had been urged by American composer Henry Cowell, Ives' contemporary, to program an Ives piece for some time and Three Places caught his attention. The thorough reworking required to transform Three Places from an orchestral score to one that could be performed by a much smaller chamber orchestra renewed Ives' interest in the work. Slonimsky required that the piece be rescored for 1 flute, 1 oboe, 1 English horn, 1 clarinet, 1 bassoon, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, 1 trombone, 1 percussionist, 1 piano, 7 violins, 2 violas, 2 cellos and 1 string bass, a much smaller orchestra than the original. Ives was glad to have his piece played, but his comments on the rescoring include, on the full score of The Housatonic at Stockbridge, \\"piano may be used for Bassoons throughout‚Ä¶ a poor substitute‚Ä¶.\\" Three Places was first performed on February 16, 1930 under Slonimsky's direction before the American Committee of the International Society for Contemporary Music in New York City. Although it had been rehearsed only once, the Committee was sufficiently impressed to recommend the work to the International Society, which surprisingly turned it down for performance at its festival. The first public performance was scheduled for January 10, 1931. Ives himself attended ‚Äì in fact, he was funding the concert himself. The performance received mild applause, and Ives congratulated the performers backstage ‚Äì \\"Just like a town meeting ‚Äì every man for himself. Wonderful how it came out!\\". After the mild success of the first performance, Slonimsky and Ives were inspired to take Three Places abroad. Slonimsky conducted the work in Paris on June 6 at a concert he described as \\"absolutely extraordinary\\" because so many important composers and critics of the time were in the audience. Their first experience of Ives left them impressed: Ives' music was not just interesting because it was composed by an American, it also fascinated them because the music really described America. Although the listeners didn't understand all the cultural references, Ives was calling attention to American ideals, issues, experiences and perspectives. For instance, in The \\"St. Gaudens\\", Ives paraphrases ragtime, slave plantation songs such as \\"Old Black Joe\\" and even patriotic American Civil War tunes such as \\"Marching through Georgia\\". The combination of such songs conjured up images of the fight for freedom in America. International recognition solidified the image of Ives as an American composer, especially strengthened by his use of borrowing from typically American-sounding pieces. Three Places became the first of Ives' compositions to be commercially published. Slonimsky was in touch with the Boston publisher C.C. Birchard on Ives‚Äô behalf, and by 1935 the two had negotiated a deal. Ives and Slonimsky both proofread the score note-by-note to make sure the engravings were correct. In 1935, Ives held a copy of his first work in his hands. He had requested that the binding bear his name in as small a font as possible, so as to not appear egotistical. = Later history = For many years, very little interest in performance of Three Places was aroused by its publication. After Slonimsky's retirement from conducting, the piece lay dormant until 1948, when longtime BSO concertmaster Richard Burgin programmed it on a Boston Symphony Orchestra concert. The current practice of performing Ives' chamber scores rescored for full orchestra was thus established. In the 1970s, interest in Three Places in New England was piqued once again, this time regarding the differences between the original 1914 scoring, much of which had been lost, and the 1929 chamber- orchestra rescoring for Slonimsky's chamber orchestra. James Sinclair of Yale University, after extensive research, concluded that the 1914 orchestration could not be recreated in its entirety since only 35% of the second movement had survived Ives' cutting for the 1929 version. Sinclair created what is currently believed to be the closest replication of the 1914 score for full orchestra by extrapolating Ives' scraps, sketches and notes. The world premiere of this version took place on February 9, 1974, at Yale University's Woolsey Hall, with the Yale Symphony Orchestra, conducted by John Mauceri, honoring the composer's 100th birthday.San Francisco Chronicle, February 22, 1974,Yale Symphony Program Notes, February 9, 1974 Movements =I. The \\"St. Gaudens\\" in Boston Common (Col. Shaw and his Colored Regiment)= The Robert Gould Shaw Memorial in Boston The first movement of Three Places is a tribute to the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial near the corner of Beacon and Park Streets in Boston, Massachusetts. The monument was created over fourteen years by the world-renowned artist Augustus Saint-Gaudens in honor of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the second all-Black regiment to serve in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Colonel Robert Shaw was the White Boston commander who led the Regiment in their assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina. Of the six hundred men who stormed the fort, 272, including Shaw, were killed, captured, or wounded. They were subsequently recognized for their courage and valor in battle. The story of the 54th Massachusetts was dramatically told, from the point of view of Colonel Shaw, in the 1989 Oscar- winning film Glory. Composed between 1913 and c.1923 and revised in 1929, it is possible that initial sketches of this piece were penned as far back as May 1911, at the time of Ives' move to Hartsdale, New York. A distinguishing characteristic of the movement is its sophisticated handling of harmonic progressions, technically atonal though supporting a diatonic melody dominated by the interval of a minor third. Ives referred to the piece as a brooding \\"Black March\\", inspired by a reflective experience at the monument. The piece evokes images of a long, slow march South to battle by the 54th. It achieves this with the use of minor third ostinatos in the bass. Ives uses chromaticism, placed distantly below the main themes, to make it sound like a vague recollection of the events rather than a vivid depiction. The piece builds to a dynamic high before rapidly receding, perhaps to signify the fate of the regiment at Fort Wagner. From a full, rich C-major chord at measure 63 (rehearsal letter H), the music falls into minor disarray and, for the last minutes, it can be heard as a solemn memorial to those lost or the crushed hopes of hundreds of black soldiers who had come to fight for the freedom of other blacks. Borrowing Of particular significance is the main melody, which is made up of a patchwork of motives from old plantation tunes or parlor songs such as \\"Massa's in the Cold Ground\\" and \\"Old Black Joe\\", and the patriotic Civil War songs \\"Marching Through Georgia\\" and \\"The Battle Cry of Freedom\\". The paraphrasing of these pieces is especially clear in the opening bars of the piece, where motives from the three main sources interweave to create an American-sounding pentatonic melody typical of many 19th-century American songs. Throughout the opening of the piece, ostinatos based upon minor third intervals are heard in the bass instruments. These are intended to evoke images of a solemn trudge down to battle. They, too, are derived from the same four source materials as the main melody. Throughout \\"Marching Through Georgia\\", \\"Old Black Joe\\", \\"The Battle Cry of Freedom\\" and \\"Massa's in the Cold Ground\\", minor third intervals predominate. Ives chose these sources because of their musical similarities and the possibility of creating fresh, seamless motives from them. Furthermore, the pieces have strong extra-musical associations Ives used to full advantage. Mixing patriotic Civil War songs with old slave plantation songs created a vivid image honoring those who fell fighting for the emancipation of blacks during the Civil War. Other borrowings in this first movement include \\"Reveille\\" and \\"Deep River\\". =II. Putnam‚Äôs Camp, Redding, Connecticut= Statue of General Israel Putnam at the entrance to Putnam Memorial State Park Derived from two earlier pieces, \\"Country Band March\\" and Overture & March: \\"1776\\" (both 1904), Putnam's Camp was finished in 1912. It is thought that working on his Fourth of July was an impetus for Ives here since he had just recently used the trio (or middle) section of 1776 in that work. A distinguishing characteristic of this movement is the combination of multiple divisions of the orchestra playing against each other while occasionally throwing in asymmetrical phrases or wild dissonances. Putnam's Camp, near Redding, Connecticut, was established as a historic landmark by the Connecticut legislature in 1887 and named in honor of the American Revolutionary War General Israel Putnam, who set up a camp in the area during the winter of 1778‚Äì79. The site has been preserved as a historic treasure because of Putnam's important role in the Revolutionary War, especially the Battle of Bunker Hill. Fourth of July celebrations are often held at the site due to its historic significance. Ives wrote a program into the score, describing the story: James Sinclair, who was responsible for the work done in the 1970s to recreate the original score of Three Places, correlated many of the measures in the score for Putnam's Camp with this program. A picture has since been worked out which shows the measures of the piece along with their programmatic significance. Borrowing Ives borrowed extensively from American patriotic tunes to create the imagery of frantically patriotic Fourth of July celebrations. The opening measures are typical of Ives in their heavy chromaticism and varying time signatures ( against ) to create the sound of community marching bands. This touchingly realistic interpretation resolves shortly after the start of the piece into a B major march, but chromaticism and disarray are never far from breaking through, giving the impression that the musicians in this band are only amateurs. Ives also experimented with quoting famous musical excerpts in different keys from the main theme. This idea stems from an incident when Ives was listening to two different marching bands and could still hear one band marching away while the other was marching towards him, thus sounding like two pieces simultaneously played in two different keys. Many American patriotic tunes, such as \\"Yankee Doodle\\" are quoted during the piece. In the last two measures of the piece, the national anthem resolves to an unexpected, dissonant chord. Borrowed tunes include \\"The British Grenadiers\\", \\"Marching Through Georgia\\", \\"The Girl I Left Behind, \\"Arkansas Traveler\\", \\"Massa's in the Cold Ground\\", \\"The Battle Cry of Freedom\\", \\"Yankee Doodle\\", \\"Columbia, Gem of the Ocean\\", \\"Hail, Columbia\\", \\"Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!\\", \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\"; and Richard Wagner's \\"The Ride of the Valkyries\\". =III. The Housatonic at Stockbridge= The Housatonic River, inspiration for the third movement of Three Places in New England First drafts were written primarily in the summer of 1908, reworked in 1911 and then again in 1913, extending the atmospheric depiction of mists and running water far longer than the original first two measures. The scoring was completed in 1914. It was arranged as a song in 1921 to lines excerpted from Robert Underwood Johnson's poem To the Housatonic at Stockbridge, but this final movement of Three Places in New England is purely orchestral. It features strident polyrhythmic activity in the strings, coupled with a hymn- like tune derived from the opening motto of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. This piece was inspired by a walk Ives had taken with his new wife, Harmony, in June 1908 on a honeymoon hiking trip in western Massachusetts and Connecticut, a rural setting they enjoyed so much that they chose to go back to the Berkshires the very next weekend. While there, they took a walk by the Housatonic River near Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Ives recalled, Two days later, on 30 June 1908, Ives sketched some ideas to try to capture the atmosphere of this rustic scene. He used irregular, quasi-isorhythmic ostinatos in the violins to create the image of mist and fog rolling over swirling waters, and an English horn and violas to mimic the sound of singing from a church across the river.  Borrowing  Unlike the other pieces in this set, no American folk tunes are quoted in it. Instead, this piece exemplifies Ives' use of paraphrase, namely of Isaac B. Woodbury's hymn tune \\"Dorrance\\", and can thus be classed as an extended paraphrased melody using the following devices: *Rhythmic alteration (mm. 7‚Äì9, 11‚Äì12). *Omission (mm. 9‚Äì10, 12‚Äì13) *Repetition (mm. 17‚Äì19) *Transposition (third, fourth verses) *Elision (a single note in Ives' melody takes the place of two notes in the source) *Interpolation of new material *Variation of previously paraphrased materials (mm. 35‚Äì36, 37‚Äì38 vary material paraphrased for m. 23) \\"Missionary Chant\\" begins in the same way as Dorrance except for an added note, which occasionally Ives adds to his paraphrased melody, suggesting that \\"Missionary Chant\\" may also be borrowed. Ives recomposed this movement as an art song for a solo singer with piano accompaniment. The original symphonic version was purely instrumental, but conductor Michael Tilson Thomas took the liberty of adding a full choir to sing the \\"Dorrance\\"-based melody in place of the horns/woodwinds/lower strings when he rerecorded the work in 2002 with the San Francisco Symphony on the RCA label. This was likely inspired by performing Ives' Holiday Symphony, which originally did use a chorus at the end of the final movement.

Pearson and Mangesh Hattikudur while they were students at Duke University. According to the Mental Floss website, the idea came from conversations in the Duke cafeteria about the need for an entertaining educational magazine. According to Hattikudur, they wanted to \\"distill some of the best lectures from our favorite college professors. We thought if we could bottle their enthusiasm and deliver it in monthly installments, it'd be great.\\" Later, Pearson met with president of Duke University, who loved the idea, but disliked the name. The first published issue, known as the \\"Campus Edition\\", was published in spring 2000, distributing 3,000 issues. The founders spent much of their first year looking for investors and staff members while raising funds to publish the first issue, which was released in May 2001.

In English it is usually known as the \\"lace aloe\\" or \\"guinea-fowl aloe\\". The species was described by Adrian Hardy Haworth. Its species name \\"aristata\\" comes from the Latin for \\"bristly\\" or \\"awned\\", and refers to the lacy edges of the leaves. Its generic name has the same etymology. Recent phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that the genus Aloe is polyphyletic and that this unusual species is not in fact an aloe, but is more closely related to Astroloba and to the four \\"Robustipedunculares\\" species of Haworthia. It has therefore been moved to its own genus, Aristaloe, to account for its separate ancestry and genetic uniqueness.Manning, J.C., Boatwright, J.S., Daru, B.H., Maurin, O. and Van der Bank, M. 2014. A molecular phylogeny and generic classification of Asphodelaceae subfamily Alooideae: A final resolution of the prickly issue of polyphyly in the Alooids? Systematic Botany 39(1):55-74. Description It is stemless, sawtoothed and succulent. The soft succulent leaves grow in rosettes, and are lanceolate with bristly margins. Its nectar-rich, tubular orange flowers tend to attract birds, bees, and wasps easily. When not in bloom, it is similar to and often confused with some other species, such as Haworthiopsis fasciata. Distribution It is indigenous to South Africa and Lesotho. Its natural range extends from the Karoo region of the Northern Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa, eastwards through the Orange Free State and Lesotho, as far as the borders of Kwazulu-Natal Province. Within such a wide range, this adaptable little species inhabits a range of environments, from the dry, sandy Nama Karoo, to the high grasslands and cold mountain slopes of Lesotho, and the shady forested valleys of KwaZulu-Natal. Cultivation It is commonly cultivated as a garden plant around the world. It prefers well-drained soils, but can tolerate a range of rainfall systems. It can also tolerate temperatures down to -7 ¬∞C, due to its adaptation to cold mountain tops. However it may need to be grown indoors or under glass in extremely cold temperate regions, to give it some winter heat. This clumping species readily produces large numbers of off-sets, which can be separated and planted as a means of propagation. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

His research career has been based almost entirely at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and the MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, in Cambridge, England. He is credited with invented techniques to both humanise (1986) and, later, to fully humanise using phage display, antibodies for therapeutic uses.The Scientific Founders of Bicycle Therapeutics Ltd. ‚Äì Christian Heinis and Sir Greg Winter, FRS. Previously, antibodies had been derived from mice, which made them difficult to use in human therapeutics because the human immune system had anti-mouse reactions to them. For these developments Winter was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with George Smith and Frances Arnold. He is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge and was appointed Master of Trinity College, Cambridge on 2 October 2012. From 2006 to 2011, he was Deputy Director of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Medical Research Council, acting Director from 2007 to 2008 and Head of the Division of Protein and Nucleic Acids Chemistry from 1994 to 2006. He was also Deputy Director of the MRC Centre for Protein Engineering from 1990 to its closure in 2010. Education Winter was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne. He went on to study Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1973. He was awarded a PhD degree, from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, for research on the amino acid sequence of tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase from the bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus in 1977 supervised by Brian S. Hartley. Later, Winter completed a term of post-doctoral fellowship at Imperial College London, and another at the Institute of genetics in University of Cambridge. Career and research Following his PhD, Winter completed postdoctoral research at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. He continued to specialise in protein and nucleic acid sequencing and became a Group Leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1981. He became interested in the idea that all antibodies have the same basic structure, with only small changes making them specific for one target. Georges K√∂hler and C√©sar Milstein had won the 1984 Nobel Prize for their work at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, in discovering a method to isolate and reproduce individual, or monoclonal, antibodies from among the multitude of different antibody proteins that the immune system makes to seek and destroy foreign invaders attacking the body. However, these monoclonal antibodies had limited application in human medicine, because mouse monoclonal antibodies are rapidly inactivated by the human immune response, which prevents them from providing long-term benefits. Winter then pioneered a technique to \\"humanise\\" mouse monoclonal antibodies; a technique that was used in the development of Campath-1H by the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and University of Cambridge scientists. This antibody now looks promising for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Humanised monoclonal antibodies form the majority of antibody-based drugs on the market today and include several blockbuster antibodies, such as Keytruda, which works with your immune system to help fight certain cancers. Winter founded Cambridge Antibody Technology in 1989 , and Bicycle Therapeutics. He worked on the Scientific Advisory Board of Covagen, (now part of Cilag) and is also the chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board for Biosceptre International Limited. In 1989, Winter was a founder of Cambridge Antibody Technology, one of the early commercial biotech companies involved in antibody engineering. One of the most successful antibody drugs developed was HUMIRA (adalimumab), which was discovered by Cambridge Antibody Technology as D2E7, and developed and marketed by Abbott Laboratories. HUMIRA, an antibody to TNF alpha, was the world's first fully human antibody, which went on to become the world's top selling pharmaceutical with sales of over $18Bn in 2017 Cambridge Antibody Technology was acquired by AstraZeneca in 2006 for ¬£702m.http://www.astrazeneca.com/media/latest-press- releases/2006/5266?itemId=3891617 In 2000, Winter founded Domantis to pioneer the use of domain antibodies, which use only the active portion of a full- sized antibody. Domantis was acquired by the pharmaceutical GlaxoSmithKline in December 2006 for ¬£230 million.GSK is to buy Domantis ‚Äì a company based on discoveries by MRC scientists LMB webpage Winter subsequently founded another company, Bicycle Therapeutics Limited as a start up company which is developing very small protein mimics based on a covalently bonded hydrophobic core. =Awards and honours= Greg Winter during Nobel press conference in Stockholm, December 2018 Winter was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1990 and awarded the Royal Medal by the society in 2011 \\"for his pioneering work in protein engineering and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and his contributions as an inventor and entrepreneur\\". He was given the Scheele Award in 1994.

With its origins in Uttar Pradesh, India, chaat has become immensely popular in the rest of the Indian subcontinent. The word derives from Hindi cƒÅ·π≠ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§ü (tasting, a delicacy), from cƒÅ·π≠nƒÅ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§ü‡§®‡§æ (to lick, as in licking ones fingers while eating), from Prakrit ca·π≠·π≠ei ‡§ö‡§ü‡•ç‡§ü‡•á‡§á (to devour with relish, eat noisily).Oxford English Dictionary. Chaat. Mar. 2005 Online edition. Retrieved 2008-02-18. Overview Aloo tikki served with hari (mint and cilantro chutney), saunth chutneys, and dahi (yogurt) The chaat variants are all based on fried dough, with various other ingredients. The original chaat is a mixture of potato pieces, crisp fried bread dahi vada or dahi bhalla, gram or chickpeas and tangy-salty spices, with sour Indian chili and saunth (dried ginger and tamarind sauce), fresh green coriander leaves and yogurt for garnish, but other popular variants included aloo tikkis or samosa (garnished with onion, coriander, hot spices and a dash of curd), bhel puri, dahi puri, panipuri, dahi vada, papri chaat, and sev puri. There are common elements among these variants including dahi (yogurt); chopped onions and coriander; sev (thin dried yellow salty noodles); and chaat masala, typically consisting of amchoor (dried mango powder), cumin, kala namak (Himalayan black rock salt), coriander, dried ginger, salt, black pepper, and red pepper. The ingredients are combined and served on a small metal plate or a banana leaf, dried and formed into a bowl. History Some scholars trace origins of chaats such as Dahi Vada (Dahi Bare) to ancient periods. A recipe for dahi wada (as kshiravata) is mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka. According to food historian, K.T Achaya descriptions of dahi vada also appear in literature from 500 B.C. According to culinary anthropologist Kurush Dalal, the Chaat originated in northern India (now Uttar Pradesh) in the late 17th century during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. He further added that the royal doctors had asked the people of Mughal capital Delhi to consume spicy and fried snacks as well as dahi as a countermeasure to the alkaline water of Yamuna river of the city so the Chaat was invented. Most chaats originated in some parts of Uttar Pradesh in India, but they are now eaten all across the Indian subcontinent and neighboring countries. Some are results of cultural syncretism - for instance, pav bhaji (bread/bun with cooked and mashed vegetables) originated in Mumbai but reflects a Portuguese influence, in the form of a bun, and bhel puri and sevpuri, which originated in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Regions In cities where chaat is popular, there are popular chaathouses or dhabas, such as Mumbai's Chowpatty Beach. The chaat specialities vary from city to city. Chaat from Delhi (from where it originated in its current form), Lucknow, Prayagraj Azamgarh, Varanasi, Agra, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, and Mathura are famous throughout India. In Hyderabad, chaat is mostly prepared by vendors hailing from Bihar, and is different in taste.

History The Beyazidiye Camii was commissioned by Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II, and was the second large imperial mosque complex to be erected in Istanbul after the conquest. As the earliest complex, the Fatih Mosque was subsequently destroyed by earthquakes and completely rebuilt in a different style, the Beyazidiye complex is of considerable historical and architectural significance.Freely, Blue Guide Istanbul pp. 151-153 The mosque was constructed between 1500 and 1505. The k√ºlliye (religious and charitable complex) of the mosque includes a nearby medrese (madrasa), completed in 1507, a large hamam (bathhouse), completed some time before 1507, an imaret (public kitchen), a caravanserai, and several mausoleums including the t√ºrbe of Bayezid II himself. The architect of the complex is not firmly established but Yakub≈üah ibn Islam≈üah is believed to have been chief architect, though Mimar Hayreddin is also named. At least one of Yakub≈üah's assistant architects succeeded him to finish the medrese. That the architect was a nephew of the Greek architect of the Fatih Mosque (Atik Sinan or Christodoulos), is known from a grant of Bayazid II.Van Millingen, Alexander (1912). Byzantine Churches of Constantinople. London: MacMillan & Co., p. 276. This grant confirms the endowment by Mehmed II of the Greek orthodox Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols, the only church in Istanbul never converted into a mosque, to the mother of Christodoulos (the Bayezid II Mosque's architect's grandmother) in acknowledgment of the two architects' work. Little else is known about the architect other than that he also built a caravansarai in Bursa; however, the polished style of the mosque itself indicates experience with earlier Ottoman and western architectural techniques.Owsenwald, The Middle East, pp.211 The dome was partially rebuilt after an earthquake in 1509, and Mimar Sinan conducted further repairs in 1573-74\\\\. The minarets burned separately in 1683 and 1764. An inscription above the courtyard entrance suggests that repairs were also conducted in 1767, as consequence of the earthquake which struck Istanbul one year before. Architecture =Exterior= The mosque is oriented along the northwest-southeast axis with a courtyard to the northwest with an area almost equal to that of the mosque itself. the courtyard has monumental entrance portals on each side. The courtyard is a colonnaded peristyle, with twenty ancient columns of porphyry, verd antique and granite salvaged from churches and ancient ruins, roofed with 24 small domes, and with a pavement in polychrome marble. The mosque itself is approximately square, with a diameter dome. The design is that of a central dome held by two semi- domes along the main axis and two arches running along the secondary axis. The mosque is constructed entirely of cut stone appropriating colored stones and marbles appropriated from nearby Byzantine ruins. =Interior= Interior of Bayezid Camii The interior of the mosque is patterned after the Hagia Sophia on a smaller scale. In addition to the huge central dome, semidomes to the east and west form a nave, whereas to the north and south extend side aisles, each with four small domes which extend the length of the mosque, but which are not divided into galleries. The dome is supported by huge rectangular piers, with smooth pendentives and stalactite decorations. The space is lit with twenty windows at the base of the dome and seven windows on each semi- dome, in addition to two tiers of windows on the walls. On the west side, a broad extended corridor extends considerable beyond the main structure of the building. Originally designed as four domed rooms to serve as a hospice for wandering dervishes, the wings were integrated into the prayer hall in the sixteenth century and now consist of three consecutive rooms separated by archways.Bayezid II Complex , ArchNet. At the ends of these wings are the two minarets. =Grounds= Behind the mosque is a small garden, containing the t√ºrbe (tombs) of Sultan Bayezid II, his daughter Sel√ßuk Hatun, and Grand Vizier Koca Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha. Below the garden is an arcade of shops whose rents were originally intended to support the mosque. This arcade was designed by Mimar Sinan in 1580 and extensively restored in the 1960s. The former public kitchens of the mosque was converted into the State Library of Istanbul by Sultan Abdulhamid II in 1882 and houses over 120,000 books and 7000 manuscripts. Likewise, the former madrasah now houses the Istanbul Municipal Library. The monumental Bayezid II Hamam was restored in the 2000s and early 2010s before being reopened as the Museum of Turkish Hamam Culture in 2015.

All CLC freight cars are painted a navy blue color with white lettering, although some have worn a mineral red color, and the CLC's locomotives are painted navy blue with white lettering and white pinstripes across the top quarter of the bodies and across the frame sill. However, in times past, some of the locomotives also wore Weyerhaeuser's color scheme of yellow and black. The lone caboose is painted safety yellow with black lettering, Weyerhaeuser colors, and seems to be one of Weyerhaeuser's old cabooses, most likely either #1 or #2. A signature safety feature of CLC's locomotives is the blue strobe light on the roof of the locomotives. CLC chooses blue as their safety light color because of the large number of yellow and red flashing safety lights around the Weyerhaeuser mill in Longview. Commodities and customers The main commodities transported along the rails are newsprint, plywood chips, pulpboard, industrial waste and chemicals. Companies using the railroad services are Weyerhaeuser, Georgia-Pacific, NORPAC, Flexible Foam, Equa-Chlor, PPG Industries, Canexus and Solvay Chemicals.

They were published in 1889, and were the first compositions by Satie he did not publish in his father's music publishing house. An example of French Gothic orgival arches, the type that inspired Satie's Ogives Satie was said to have been inspired by the form of the windows of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris when composing the Ogives. An ogive is the curve that forms the outline of a pointed gothic arch. The calm, slow melodies of these pieces are built up from paired phrases reminiscent of plainchant. Satie wanted to evoke a large pipe organ reverberating in the depth of a cathedral, and achieved this sonority by using full harmonies, octave doubling and sharply contrasting dynamics. Satie wrote this music without bar-lines.

It is located on the property of Walt Disney World in the city of Bay Lake. Between 1974 and 1999, it was an attraction open to guests, who could observe its many species of animals and birds. Disney originally named it Treasure Island, and later renamed it Discovery Island. It currently sits abandoned, but can be seen by any watercraft in Bay Lake. Discovery Island is now the name of one of the lands in Disney's Animal Kingdom. History =Origins= From 1900 to 1937, the island was known as Raz Island, named after the family that lived there. In the late 1930s, it was purchased for $800 by a man named Delmar \\"Radio Nick\\" Nicholson, who renamed it \\"Idle Bay Isle\\" and lived there for 20 years with his wife and pet crane. It was later sold, renamed \\"Riles Island,\\" and used as a hunting retreat. Disney bought it in 1965 as part of its strategic property acquisitions before building the Walt Disney World Resort. Delmar lived on the island and grew exotic plants prior to the island's acquisition by Disney. =Opening= The island opened as Treasure Island on April 8, 1974, as a place to observe wildlife, and was later renamed Discovery Island when it was recognized as a zoological park. The admission cost in 1995 was $10.60 for adults and $5.83 for children aged three through nine. In March 1999, admission was $12.67, 6.89 for children, including tax. The island's facilities were the home of the last known Dusky Seaside Sparrow before it died in July 1987. In 1989, Disney was accused by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals of mistreating vultures that landed on Discovery Island. Disney confirmed some of them died while being captured by their employees. Following this allegation, State and Federal officials charged Disney with 16 counts of animal cruelty. These charges were ultimately dropped after Disney made improvements, but did not admit to wrongdoings. =Closure= Discovery Island closed to the public on April 8, 1999, exactly 25 years after its opening. but continued to operate until July 9, 1999, at which point all of its animals had been relocated to Disney's Animal Kingdom (whose Safari Village hub area was renamed Discovery Island) and other zoos. Although Disney never officially stated its reasons for closing the park, poor attendance and high maintenance costs, combined with the newer and bigger Disney's Animal Kingdom being opened a year before, are the most likely causes. Since its closing, the island has sat largely abandoned, with no signs of development. As of 2020, all original buildings and attractions remain on the island, though several have sustained major damage from hurricanes and natural decay. Disney also considered teaming up with Cyan Worlds to turn the island into a replica of the titular island from the video game Myst, where visitors would solve puzzles while exploring. Today, the island can easily be seen from Walt Disney World Monorail, Disney's Wilderness Lodge, Disney's Contemporary Resort and Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, as well as from boat trips between them. It is adjacent to Disney's River Country, which closed in November 2001. =Unsanctioned visit= On April 30, 2020, a man was arrested for camping on Discovery Island during the COVID-19 pandemic. He was subsequently removed from the island and banned from Walt Disney property. He called the island a \\"tropical paradise\\", and said he did not know the area was off limits to the public.

The mansion's external decorations and indigo-blue outer walls make it a very distinctive building, and it is sometimes referred to as The Blue Mansion. Built by the merchant Cheong Fatt Tze at the end of the 19th century, the mansion has 38 rooms, 5 granite-paved courtyards, 7 staircases and 220 vernacular timber louvre windows. It served as Cheong's private residence as well as the seat of his business activities in Penang. The mansion is eclectic, but mainly reflects Chinese architectural styles of the Imperial Period. Features of the house include Gothic louvred windows, Chinese cut and paste porcelain work, Stoke- on-Trent floor tiles made of encaustic clay in geometric pieces all shaped to fit to a perfect square, Glasgow cast iron works by MacFarlane's & Co. and Art Nouveau stained glass windows. The mansion was originally built with careful attention to the principles of Feng Shui. The domestic annexe is built in front of it to prevent any road being built to create a T-junction in front of it; it has water running through a meandering network of pipes that begin from the eaves of the roof, channelled through the upper ceiling, down the walls collecting in the central courtyard before being channelled away from the property via a similar network of pipes, in this case, underneath the entire flooring system and is built with a step in the middle to create a slope (to ride on the dragon's back). The distinctive blue colour of the mansion is the result of mixing lime with natural blue dye made from the indigo plant. The blue was very popular in the Colonial period and the dye was imported from India to Penang by the British. The lime-wash was very effective in a tropical weather as it absorbed moisture and cooled the house whilst dispelling moisture without damage to the structural integrity of the walls. Though white was the most easily available colour, the indigo-blue was chosen because it was highly prized by all communities, adding stature to the mansion. The mansion was purchased from Cheong Fatt Tze's descendants in 1989 by a group of local Penang individuals to save the edifice from encroaching development and possible demolition. The property operates as an 18 Room Hotel-cum-museum as part of the adaptive reuse of an ongoing restoration project which has won awards from UNESCO. Tours are offered in English three times a day to central parts of the house. In 2016, a restaurant called 'Indigo' opened on the first floor of the mansion. The mansion has been featured in various films including the 1993 Oscar-winning French film Indochine starring Catherine Deneuve, The Red Kebaya, Road to Dawn, 3rd Generation and the critically acclaimed The Blue Mansion in 2009 by Singapore director Glen Goei of Forever Fever fame. The mansion has also been featured in programs broadcast on various international television channels (CNN, BCC, The History Channel, Discovery Travel & Living). Most recently the mansion served as one of the locations for the Hollywood blockbuster Crazy Rich Asians.

This uses a Brownian bridge. A Brownian bridge is a continuous-time stochastic process B(t) whose probability distribution is the conditional probability distribution of a Wiener process W(t) (a mathematical model of Brownian motion) subject to the condition (when standardized) that W(T) = 0, so that the process is pinned at the origin at both t=0 and t=T. More precisely: : B_t := (W_t\\\\mid W_T=0),\\\\;t \\\\in [0,T] The expected value of the bridge is zero, with variance \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{t(T-t)}{T}, implying that the most uncertainty is in the middle of the bridge, with zero uncertainty at the nodes. The covariance of B(s) and B(t) is s(T ‚àí t)/T if s < t. The increments in a Brownian bridge are not independent.  Relation to other stochastic processes  If W(t) is a standard Wiener process (i.e., for t ‚â• 0, W(t) is normally distributed with expected value 0 and variance t, and the increments are stationary and independent), then : B(t) = W(t) - \\\\frac{t}{T} W(T)\\\\, is a Brownian bridge for t ‚àà [0, T]. It is independent of W(T)Aspects of Brownian motion, Springer, 2008, R. Mansuy, M. Yor page 2 Conversely, if B(t) is a Brownian bridge and Z is a standard normal random variable independent of B, then the process : W(t) = B(t) + tZ\\\\, is a Wiener process for t ‚àà [0, 1]. More generally, a Wiener process W(t) for t ‚àà [0, T] can be decomposed into : W(t) = B\\\\left(\\\\frac{t}{T}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{t}{\\\\sqrt{T}} Z. Another representation of the Brownian bridge based on the Brownian motion is, for t ‚àà [0, T] : B(t) = \\\\frac{(T-t)}{\\\\sqrt T} W\\\\left(\\\\frac{t}{T-t}\\\\right). Conversely, for t ‚àà [0, ‚àû] : W(t) = \\\\frac{T+t}{T} B\\\\left(\\\\frac{Tt}{T+t}\\\\right). The Brownian bridge may also be represented as a Fourier series with stochastic coefficients, as : B_t = \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty Z_k \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2 T} \\\\sin(k \\\\pi t / T)}{k \\\\pi} where Z_1, Z_2, \\\\ldots are independent identically distributed standard normal random variables (see the Karhunen‚ÄìLo√®ve theorem). A Brownian bridge is the result of Donsker's theorem in the area of empirical processes. It is also used in the Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test in the area of statistical inference.  Intuitive remarks  A standard Wiener process satisfies W(0) = 0 and is therefore \\"tied down\\" to the origin, but other points are not restricted. In a Brownian bridge process on the other hand, not only is B(0) = 0 but we also require that B(T) = 0, that is the process is \\"tied down\\" at t = T as well. Just as a literal bridge is supported by pylons at both ends, a Brownian Bridge is required to satisfy conditions at both ends of the interval [0,T]. (In a slight generalization, one sometimes requires B(t1) = a and B(t2) = b where t1, t2, a and b are known constants.) Suppose we have generated a number of points W(0), W(1), W(2), W(3), etc. of a Wiener process path by computer simulation. It is now desired to fill in additional points in the interval [0,T], that is to interpolate between the already generated points W(0) and W(T). The solution is to use a Brownian bridge that is required to go through the values W(0) and W(T).  General case  For the general case when B(t1) = a and B(t2) = b, the distribution of B at time t ‚àà (t1, t2) is normal, with mean :a + \\\\frac{t-t_1}{t_2-t_1}(b-a) and the covariance between B(s) and B(t), with s < t is :\\\\frac{(t_2-t)(s-t_1)}{t_2-t_1}.

It is located north of the Singapore River, in the planning area of Rochor, known as the Malay-Muslim quarter. History The name of the area is thought to be derived from the cajeput tree, called \\"gelam\\" in Malay.Gelam or Kayu putih, Wild Singapore. Updated August 2009, accessed 11 January 2014. \\"Kampong\\" (modern spelling \\"kampung\\") simply means \\"village\\". Prior to colonisation by the British in 1819, the area was home to the Malay aristocracy of Singapore. It became prominent and more populous after the signing of a treaty between the British East India Company, Sultan Hussein Shah of Johor and Temenggong Abdul Rahman in 1819. The company was given the right to set up a trading post in Singapore under this treaty. During the colony's early history, under the Raffles Plan of 1822, the settlement was divided according to different ethnic groups which included European Town, Chinese, Chulia, Arab and Bugis kampongs. Kampong Glam was designated for the Sultan and his household, as well as the Malay and Arab communities, many of whom were merchants. It was situated east of what was then the European Town. While the Temenggong and his followers settled in Telok Blangah, Sultan Hussein, his family and followers settled in Kampong Glam. In return, the Sultan was given large areas of land for residential use in Kampong Glam under the treaty. The land was allocated to the Malays and other Muslim immigrants to Singapore, including the Malays from Malacca, the Riau Islands and Sumatra in Indonesia. It also included the Baweanese, Banjarese, Chinese and Indians. The second half of the nineteenth century saw the rapid growth of immigrant communities in Kampong Glam, initially from Sumatra, and later from other parts of Indonesia and Malaya. This resulted in the setting up of different kampongs, like Kampong Malacca, Kampong Java and Kampong Bugis. There were also a small but successful Arab community of traders in the area. In the early twentieth century, commercial activities in Kampong Glam expanded as new shop houses and residential buildings were built. A multi-ethnic community soon developed there, comprising not only Malays and Arabs but also the Chinese and Indians. Later, due to an expansion of commercial activities and an increase in immigrant settlers in Kampong Glam, the Arabs moved to areas like Joo Chiat, Tanglin and Bukit Tunggal (the stretch of Dunearn Road near the junction of Balmoral Road and Chancery Lane, near Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) today, was called Tunggal Road). By the early 1920s, many Malays also moved out to designated resettlement areas in Geylang Serai and Kampong Eunos. Present Aerial perspective of Kampong Glam. October 2018. Restored shophouses on Kandahar Street. Today, Kampong Glam still retains strong ties to the Native-Malay and Muslim community and has sometimes been termed the \\"Muslim Quarter\\" due to its history. The Muslim population still remains a significant presence in Kampong Glam, especially in Bussorah Street. The area remains a centre for Muslim activities and the Sultan Mosque remains a major landmark and congregation point for the Singapore Muslims. Like Little India and Chinatown, Kampong Glam has been restored, refurbished and new life breathed into it, bringing back the former colour and vibrancy of the area. Rows of conserved shophouses can be found in Haji Lane, Arab Street, Baghdad Street and Bussorah Street. Many of these shophouses have new tenants such as design and IT firms, art galleries, crafts and curiosity shops, food caterers, cafes, bars and restaurants. They blend in with traditional businesses like textile and carpet shops, blacksmiths and shops selling religious items used by Muslims. It is also an area of good restaurants, from Malaysian coffee shops and bakeries to fine modern European dining, like Le Pont De Vie. On 16 December 2006, a fire broke out at four shophouses at Sultan Gate at 2145 (SST) with the four shophouses destroyed by the fire. It nearly spread to nearby food and beverage outlets in the vicinity. Of the four shophouses destroyed, two were vacant, one was a blacksmith shop and the other a shoe shop. Firefighters controlled the fire by surrounding it as it spread through the roof. According to eyewitnesses, the fire started from the second floor of the blacksmith shop. The blacksmith shop is one of the oldest types of shophouses in Singapore which was used for educational tours. It is the last blacksmith shop in the area. Political history Beginning from the 1959 general elections, Kampong Glam was a division of its own called Kampong Glam Single Member Constituency where the Member of Parliament (MP) seat was held by Former Deputy Prime Minister S. Rajaratnam until 1988 when Loh Meng See took over and served until 2006. However, after the 1991 general elections, Kampong Glam SMC along with several neighbouring wards were absorbed into the bigger Kampong Glam Group Representation Constituency which existed for only one term and the ruling party People's Action Party had won the seats on the nomination day itself. Subsequently, in the 1997 general elections, Kampong Glam GRC was disbanded and Kampong Glam's electoral division was reverted to Kampong Glam SMC with single-member representation that lasted until the 2001 general election whereby the redrawing of electoral boundaries saw it absorbed into Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency, which includes parts of the Downtown Core. Loh has since retired from politics by 2006 general election and the current MP is Denise Phua who represents Jalan Besar GRC. In the 2011 general elections, Jalan Besar GRC was dissolved and became part of the newly created Moulmein-Kallang Group Representation Constituency; Edwin Tong has since taken over the helm. But in 2015, Jalan Besar GRC was revived and both Denise Phua and Dr Yaacob Ibrahim took over the helm of the entire GRC and Edwin Tong was transferred to Marine Parade GRC's Joo Chiat ward.

Not only was he SNL's first openly gay male cast member but he was the first openly gay series regular on network television;Uncommon Heroes: A Celebration of Heroes and Role Models for Gay and Lesbian Americans publisher+Fletcher Press year=1994 isbn_B000UCIBGI Sweeney was \\"out\\" prior to being hired as a cast member. Sweeney's run on the show came at a time when there were few openly gay characters or actors on television, and with Danitra Vance (a black lesbian whose sexuality wasn't known until her death in 1994), also marked the first time Saturday Night Live had two people on the LGBTQ+ spectrum as cast members. For roughly 27 years, there were no other openly gay cast members on SNL, until Kate McKinnon (a former cast member of Logo's The Big Gay Sketch Show) was added to the cast in April 2012, and an openly gay male cast member wouldn't be hired again until John Milhiser was picked for the 39th season (and even then, Milhiser, like Terry Sweeney, only lasted a season). During his season on SNL, he became known for his celebrity impersonations, particularly female impersonations of stars like Diana Ross, Patti LaBelle, Joan Collins, Brooke Shields's mother Teri Shields, and Joan Rivers, as well as Ted Kennedy (the only male celebrity he impersonated). His most notable recurring character was a portrayal of then-First Lady Nancy Reagan; While at SNL, he faced many hardships from both the writers and cast because of his sexuality, especially from Chevy Chase. Sweeney was told by Ron Reagan, who hosted one of that season's episodes, that he was \\"more like his mother than she is.\\" = Other credits = Sweeney has written for the FOX TV series MADtv, The WB's short-lived sketch comedy series Hype (and co-created),Out Magazine, September 2000, p. 62 and Sci Fi Channel's Tripping the Rift, among a few others, all with his partner, Lanier Laney. Sweeney's major film credit was as the co-screenwriter for the film Shag, which was released in 1989. Sweeney also performed a stand-up routine for the special Coming Out Party in 2000, which centered on his rough childhood in the 1960s, how he explored his sexuality in the 1970s, how he tried to survive the 1980s with the AIDS epidemic, conservative politics, and being open about his sexuality when he was chosen to be a cast member for Saturday Night Live (making history as the first openly gay male actor to ever appear on a network TV show); and his post-SNL life, when he and Lanier Laney cared for Laney's mother, who had Alzheimer's disease and didn't know her son was a homosexual. He is the author of two published books. The first, \\"Nancy Reagan: It's Still My Turn\\" (1990) which started as performance art piece at Highways in Santa Monica, and transferred to New York's the Actor's Playhouse Off Broadway. His second book, \\"Irritable Bowels and the People Who Give You Them\\" (2015), is a collection of comic essays about his life in Hollywood. In 2018 he appeared in two episodes of FX's Emmy Award-winningThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story as David Gallo. = Episodes of Tripping the Rift written by Sweeney and Laney =\\"Mutilation Ball\\" (also written with Sy Rosen) *\\"Power to the Peephole\\" *\\"Android Love\\" *\\"Roswell\\" *\\"Creaturepalooza\\" *\\"Chode's Near-Death Experience\\" *\\"Six, Lies, and Videotape\\"  Personal life  Terry Sweeney's husband is Lanier Laney, an artist and comedy writer who also wrote for SNL in the 1985‚Äì1986 season. According to a 2000 magazine article, they first met as members of a sketch comedy troupe called the \\"Bess Truman Players\\" before joining SNL. Laney and Sweeney were also writing partners for Saturday Night Live during the 1985‚Äì1986 season, the film Shag, and the Syfy Channel cartoon Tripping the Rift. As of 2012, the couple reside in Los Angeles and Beaufort, South Carolina.

A drum major or field commander is the leader of a marching band, drum and bugle corps, or pipe band, usually positioned at the head of the band or corps. The drum major is often dressed in more ornate clothing than the rest of the band or corps and is responsible for providing commands to the ensemble, leading them while marching, and directing them what to play, when to play, and what time to keep. The commands may be given verbally, through hand gestures, using a whistle or a baton, or with a mace. Although the drum major is the one conducting for the entire band to see and watch to keep time, the drum major is actually looking at the center snare's feet to keep time. The center snare is the leader of the Drumline, and is the one who keeps the band in time while marching. He/she usually plays taps and/or some rolls to set the tempo of how fast the band marches. In addition, the drum major serves as the liaison between the band director and the band. Essentially, a drum major is the leader who keeps the tempo with the use of a baton or other forms of time- keeping, such as conducting. The drum major often holds the responsibility to keep the band organized and structured. History A Tambour-Major of the French Imperial Guard (historical reenactment) The position of drum major originated in the British Army with the Corps of Drums in 1650. Military groups performed mostly duty calls and battle signals during that period, and a fife and drum corps, directed by the drum major, would use short pieces to communicate to field units. With the arrival of military concert bands and pipe bands around the 18th century, the position of the drum major was adapted to those ensembles. Traditionally, a military drum major was responsible for: *Defending the drummers and bandsmen (The drums and bugles were communication devices) *Military discipline of all Corps of Drums members *The Corps of Drums' overall standards of dress and deportment *Corps of Drums administrative work *Maintain the Corps of Drums' standard of military drill and choreograph marching movements The drum major was also given duties in the battalion at several points in history, which included the administering of military justice (flogging) to any member of the battalion, and collecting the battalion's post. In addition to the duties above, the British Army also included a royal appointment of Drum Major General, whose duties included inspecting all other Field Music as well as (per The Drummer's Handbook) granting drummers licenses without which, one would not be recognized as a drummer. This position faded in the 18th century. Drum major and infantry musician of the line in Napoleon's First Empire army, 1810 Roles ;Conductor Drum majors are responsible for knowing the music of the ensemble and conducting it appropriately. While also knowing the tempo the drum major has to know what specific pattern he or she needs to perform in order to accommodate physical stamina or musical style. ;Patterns Drum majors may each have a different style of conducting. Some may be smoother, but others are more rigid. The most commonly used pattern is called the \\"Down-in-out-up\\" pattern. The pattern is shown by the first beat being straight down and normal. The second beat goes down then after the focal point it goes in a 45 degree angle to the inside. The third beat is when the arm is coming back from the angle to the focal point at the angle and hits the point and goes to the outside at the same 45 degree angle. The last beat, fourth, goes from the outside angle back to the focal point. Then the process repeats. It is typical for drum majors to use smaller, simpler patterns to accommodate faster tempos for endurance and clarity, emphasizing beats 1 and 3 and minimizing beats 2 and 4. ;Controlling tempo What is \\"appropriate\\" conducting has evolved over the decades. During the 1970s and prior it was not uncommon for a stationary drum major to do a high-lift mark time on the podium for an audible and visual tempo; with the arrival of increasingly higher drum major platforms and thus greater visibility this has become both dangerous and unnecessary. Current drum majors use a variety of conducting patterns and styles that suit the needs of their respective marching bands and/or drum corps. ;Assisting musicality In addition to memorizing the music (between six and nine minutes of music is typical for high school marching bands, college bands and drum corps may have that much or more, up to more than eleven minutes of music) a drum major must memorize dynamics as well as tempo in order to provide proper direction and cues, particularly in area where the drum major has some discretion, such as a ritardando or fermata. ;Performer Drum majors have slightly different roles within the world of traditional show bands. Many college bands have drum majors who are very much part of the visual element of a field show. Rather than conduct as a corps-style drum major would, traditional drum majors often march on the field with the band, using a mace or baton to keep time and flourish their own movements. Drum majors in the Big Ten and HBCUs have a particularly prominent role. While most of them do not conduct as much as a corps drum major, they lead the band onto the field, often after having several seconds for a short performance by themselves (a drum major backbend is traditional in many schools). During dance routines, they often move along with the bands. As traditional drum majors have much more of a visual role than corps drum majors, there are often many more of them, sometimes up to ten drum majors to a single band. ;Leader The drum major position is one of leadership, instruction, and group representation, but usually not administrative duties. A band director or corps director assumes administrative responsibility. In the absence of the band director, the drum major often carries the authority of the director or instructor and assumes complete leadership over the band. Equipment There are a number of specialized pieces of equipment that drum majors use to more effectively execute their duties. These include a whistle, a mace or baton, their uniform, and podium(s). ;Uniform In British and European tradition, a drum major usually wears the same uniform as the rest of the band with the additional of a diagonal sash. Drum majors of marching bands in the United States often wear a uniform different from the rest of the band (which may either be a show- specific uniform, or a custom uniform based on the school's uniform or colors) and is a slight modification of the standard uniform. It can be as simple as extra shoulder decorations, a cape, different-colored plumes, or a chain on the helmet, or as complicated as a specialized chest section, and is designed to both help the drum major stand out when coming onto the field and to give distinction to the leader of the band. Some high school drum majors do not wear a different uniform, however, and are recognized by their field or parade position. It is mostly a director's discretion, and is more common only on the high school level. ;Mace Civilian brass bands and pipe bands generally use a mace for giving signals and commands while marching. As marching bands in the United States have started to focus more directly on halftime shows and less on parades, the traditional use of the mace has largely vanished from high school and college marching bands, in preference of hand movements, occasionally with the use of a conductor's baton or whistle. ;Podium When a band is not marching, the drum major may conduct the band from a stage using a baton. United States marching bands 3 college drum majors from the West Chester University Golden Rams Marching Band lead their band onto the field. A marching band show (high school and college) usually begins with a hand salute from the drum major(s). Salutes range in complexity from a simple hand-gesture to complicated routines involving many members of the band. The salute is traditionally the beginning of judging in a competition, and also signals the end of a band's show. A drum major is also responsible for calling the band to attention, beginning, and conducting the show. The drum major may use a whistle, vocal, or hand commands to accomplish this. This practice goes back to the military origins of the marching or field band. A marching band review (parade) begins like a field show. Because of the street setting, there are usually no change in formations. Scoring is similar to a field show, however there is an added section specifically on the drum major's performance. The drum major is scored based on the execution of the opening routine, salute routine, beating time, vocal, whistle, and hand commands, and overall control of the band. To see one to three drum majors in most ensembles is typical. In some ensembles, drum majors switch positions during the show to allow all individuals a chance to conduct from the central podium. Occasionally, they may also serve in other capacities such as performing a solo, in which case one or two band directors would conduct the band temporarily until the drum major(s) would finish their/his/her solo. Drum major from Virginia Tech prepares to conduct The Marching Virginians prior to the 2010 ACC Championship Game. A marching band or drum corps drum major (field conductor) is in charge of holding the band or corps together, and directing the entire band or corps during shows and competitions. This drum major can come from any section of the performing unit: percussion, winds, or color guard. They are chosen on their musical abilities, leadership qualities, attitude, and passion for the sport. The Drum Major is the highest-ranked band participant, usually followed by the captain(s) of the drumline, then by guard captain(s), pit captain(s) horn sergeant(s), section leaders and band officers. In military bands, such as the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band or Highty-Tighties, drum majors are senior officers who are responsible for discipline and order of the band off the field, in addition to performance duties. They often command the band as an independent unit even off the playing field, and are treated according to their rank. In these bands, drum majors also march on the field and frequently use maces. Uniforms are in traditional military style; consequently, drum majors are distinguished by rank and unit insignia or distinguishing uniform modifications. For example, a drum major of the aforementioned Aggie Band could be recognized by his prominent wear of a whistle and chain, which is worn with the uniform even when not performing band-related duties. (Similar clothing in other bands may include sashes, unique headwear, or differently colored uniforms.) An example can be seen here. =High school= The drum major of the Cary, North Carolina, high school marching band prepares to lead his band onto the field at the 2009 USSBA Grand Nationals Based on how large the band is, high school marching bands have anywhere from one to four drum majors who are responsible for conducting and leading the band. Drum majors are often ranked, so that the head drum major occupies the center position during the entire show, or each drum major takes turns as the 'central' drum major by standing on a platform placed on the 50-yard line, while the other two are placed on the 30-yard or 40-yard lines. Any other majors are placed on yard lines closer to the end zone, or to the rear of the band for about-turn maneuvers. A member of the on-field band may take a position as drum major temporarily if the band's movements require an additional drum major in the front or back or if the lead drum major performs. Some drum majors serve as leadership positions and can conduct, but prefer to march. These drum majors serve as replacements in case one or more of the permanent drum majors (usually older members of the band) can't make it to a performance, but still continue to practice their conducting abilities. Depending upon the region, field conducting may be done by the band director, allowing the drum major(s) to play a more important role in the performance by marching with the rest of the band. Selection and auditions The process of appointing high school drum majors varies based on the school, though it is recognizably up to the director's discretion as to whom to select, which is done typically through an audition process where potential drum major candidates must display their conducting skills, their ability to successfully call and execute commands, and to answer questions that demonstrate what type of leader they are and what they can bring to the band. The director may, in such cases, ask one of the previous marching season's drum majors to join him or her for the auditions to help make a decision as to whom to pick (though such an opportunity is usually brought upon the lead drum major). In addition, the opportunity to be a drum major may not be open to everyone in a band, as a potential candidate may be required to first serve as a section leader, captain, or officer. Alternatively, the opportunity may only be available to band members who are juniors or seniors. Training A drum major may be trained in a number of different ways depending on the resources of his or her home program and the drum major's own experience. In many schools, the band director actually refuses to personally teach the drum major conducting and leadership (because it is supposed to be the drum major's job to make that band director's job easier). Most drum majors attend drum major camps to learn to conduct and teach their band. Drum majoring is usually thought of as a leadership responsibility that cannot be taught, and the person selected for the position is ready (or the closest to ready) to take the responsibility. To be a good drum major can never be taught or fully trained to one person. The George N. Parks Drum Major Academy (DMA) is a nationwide summer camp for high school drum majors. It was founded in 1978 by George N. Parks. The Drum Major Academy is held at various locations around the United States, by 2010 the academy drew up to 3,000 students each year. DMA provides students with marching, conducting, and leadership training in preparation for their upcoming seasons. Parks, considered a national authority on drum majoring, personally led many of these camps until his death in September 2010. Smith Walbridge Clinics (SWC) has offered a Drum Major Clinic since 1952 and claim to be the nation's first drum major camp. The clinic teaches three styles of drum majoring including traditional, corps, and mace. Other training methods include three levels of conducting, three levels of showmanship, fundamentals of drill design, verbal commands, daily individual evaluations using video tapes, leadership training, score study, teaching and cleaning drill, multi- drum major help, salutes, and mace. The clinic is hosted yearly on the campus of Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. Field competition ;Judging and adjudicating During a field show the drum major is usually evaluated by a different judge than the rest of the band. How the drum major is judged depends on the region and style of the band and personal opinions of the judge themselves. Typical captions for judging a drum major include conducting, communication between drum majors, marching, style, showmanship, and leadership. Judge's comments will often be recorded by a hand held tape recorder and supplied to the drum majors along with the rest of the band's scores and feedback from the competition. Examples of judge's evaluation sheets: *, *, ;Award ceremony If there is an awards ceremony at a marching competition, the drum major(s) usually represent their band and accept any awards. The drum major(s) will usually prepare a separate, shorter salute in order to respectfully accept awards that their band has earned.

He was one of the last surviving Munchkin-actors in The Wizard of Oz, and was also the last surviving cast member with any dialogue in the film. He portrayed the coroner who certified the death of the Wicked Witch of the East. Early life  Raabe was born in Watertown, Wisconsin as a son of Heinrich Herman Raabe (1894-1979) and Ruth [Blackburn] Raabe (1906-1966). He graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1937, with a bachelor's degree in accounting. He later went on to get his MBA at Drexel University. Raabe did not hear the words \\"midget\\" or \\"dwarf\\" until young adulthood, and for a long time believed no one else might also be like him. After visiting the Midget Village at Chicago's Century of Progress in 1933, he realized he was not alone and took a summer job with the fair the next year. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin, he was turned down for employment by one company after another until Oscar Mayer hired him as a salesman. Raabe took a leave of absence from his sales job to audition for a Wizard of Oz role. Roles  At about , or three feet, six inches, tall, he played the role of the coroner in The Wizard of Oz in 1939. Raabe, however, was uncredited in the role, which lasted only 13 seconds.'Wizard of Oz' Munchkin Meinhardt Raabe Dead at 94 In the film, the coroner confirms the death of the Wicked Witch of the East, with Raabe's lines being: : As coroner, I must aver : I thoroughly examined her : And she's not only merely dead : She's really, most sincerely dead! These lines, like most of those delivered by the Munchkins, were dubbed over with the speeded-up voices of other performers.\\"A Look Behind 'Wizard of Oz' Curtain\\". Retrieved 2018-06-11. In addition to his role in the film, Raabe worked for many decades as a spokesman for Oscar Mayer, where he was known as \\"Little Oscar, World's Smallest Chef\\". He traveled in the first Wienermobile, which was the idea of the company founder's nephew, Carl Mayer, in 1936. Because the vehicle had little space for any passengers, Mayer realized the spokesman would have to be small, and Raabe got the job. Post-Oz Raabe continued to work for Oscar Mayer, and claimed to have come up with the idea to sell canned sausages. As the idea was being commercialized, the Army realized that this product would aid in feeding American soldiers in the field, and production was diverted to military consumption, as World War II was beginning for the US. Raabe joined the Civil Air Patrol during World War II. During this time, he served as a pilot, flying fire and lake patrol missions as well as serving as a ground instructor. In 1970, he earned a master's degree in business administration from Drexel University. He married a cigarette girl who was his height, Margaret Marie Raabe (1915‚Äì1997).Margaret Marie Raabe (1915‚Äì1997) was born on February 25, 1915, and died on October 22, 1997, according to the Florida Death Index. They were married for 50 years until her death in a car accident in 1997, in which he was also injured. Raabe published an autobiography, Memories of a Munchkin: An Illustrated Walk Down the Yellow Brick Road. (). As of 2007, he lived alone at the Penney Retirement Community in Penney Farms, Florida. Raabe appeared in an October 2005 episode of Entertainment Tonight with eight other surviving Munchkins, and he made a guest appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on April 11, 2005. On November 21, 2007, he appeared with six other surviving Munchkin actors, including Jerry Maren, at the unveiling of a Hollywood Star for the Wizard of Oz Munchkins on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On September 19, 2009, he appeared on National Public Radio program Weekend Edition Saturday. Raabe still made occasional appearances at Wizard of Oz conventions and celebrations across the country. In 2008 he was honored by the International Wizard of Oz Club with the organization's L. Frank Baum Memorial Award. Death  In later life, Raabe resided at Penney Retirement Community in Penney Farms, Florida. He died at a medical center in nearby Orange Park, Florida, on April 9, 2010, at the age of 94 after going into cardiac arrest, as verified by the local coroner. He is buried in Farmington, Wisconsin's Immanuel Evangelical Lutheran Church Cemetery. Popular culture On May 2, 2011, John Darkow, an editorial cartoonist at the Columbia Daily Tribune in Columbia, Missouri, created a cartoon using a nearly-verbatim version of the lines spoken by Raabe's coroner character to announce the death of Osama bin Laden the previous day.Cagletoons web page with copy of Darkow cartoon Retrieved 2011-11-22 References External links * 1915 births 2010 deaths Disease-related deaths in Florida American male film actors Actors with dwarfism Male actors from Florida Male actors from Wisconsin Writers from Florida Writers from Wisconsin People from Watertown, Wisconsin People from Penney Farms, Florida University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Drexel University alumni People of the Civil Air Patrol ","title":"Meinhardt Raabe"},{"id":"1843863","text":"The name Josephine has been used for six tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean. * Hurricane Josephine (1984) - stayed far away from U.S. coast, but was so large that tropical storm-force winds were felt at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. * Hurricane Josephine (1990) - wandered around Atlantic, performing a full loop at one point.

In 1989 it was developed by Slovenian experts led by Borut Zupanƒçiƒç. Properties The purpose of the language is simulation of dynamic mathematical models of systems, given as set of ordinary differential equations. It is an equation oriented and compiler type of language. Despite its name it can be used for discrete simulation as well. The language suits well to the CSSL'67 standard of simulation languages so portability among other languages conforming to the same standard (e.g. Tutsim, ACSL etc.) is quite simple. It is a DOS based software occasionally it is slightly modified so it can be run under actual versions of Microsoft Windows. Apart from the simulation itself it can also perform parametrisation (a series of simulations with different values of parameters), linearisation of models and optimisation (finding such values of parameters that a criterion function is minimised). Simulation process When a simulation scheme must be prepared it must be described in the SIMCOS language. It can be \\"drawn\\" (similarly as with an analogue computer) using an enclosed block library graphics tool (it contains basic elements such as integrators, amplifiers, summators, some basic input signals etc.) but more often it is entered as a program using one of text editors, e.g. Edit enclosed with DOS. Whichever form of entry of the model is used, the first phase of simulation reprocesses it into space of states form and rewrites the program into Fortran and prepares files with input parameters. This Fortran program is compiled into an executable file (.EXE) and executed. The executable program reads parameter values from input files, performs the simulation and writes requested calculated values into another file. When it terminates, SIMCOS takes control again and can display results as a graphic plot. The \\"heart\\" of the executable is function INTEG which can solve differential equations using one of several numerical methods. First it reads necessary values (e.g. values of parameters, initial conditions) from files then it calls the function DERIV where the model is actually described as series of functions of its derivatives. The returned values are used at the selected numerical method. Requested calculated results are written into the file and the whole procedure is repeated until the termination condition is satisfied. Example Continuous simulation of dead time (its Laplace transform is e^{-sT}) is not a trivial task and usually we use one of Pad√© approximations. We will simulate Pad√© approximation of 2nd order :e^{-sT}\\\\dot{=}\\\\frac{(sT)^{2}-6sT+12}{(sT)^{2}+6sT+12} and 4th order: :e^{-sT}\\\\dot{=}\\\\frac{(sT)^{4}-20(sT)^{3}+180(sT)^{2}-840sT+1680}{(sT)^{4}+20(sT)^{3}+180(sT)^{2}+840sT+1680}. Input signal is a unit step, communication interval equals 0.01s, length simulation run is 5s, results will be compared with output of built-in discrete function delay (it requires additional array (del in our case) of appropriate size). y1 is a result of simulation of Pad√© approximation of 2nd order, y2 is a result of simulation of Pad√© approximation of 4th order and y3 is result of the discrete function delay. When transfer functions of both Pad√© approximation are developed using one of simulation schemes, the model can be described with the following program: program pade constant tm=1.0 constant tfin=5 array del(101) variable t=0.0 u=step(t,0.) u11d=12/(tm*tm)*u-12/(tm*tm)*y1 u11=integ(u11d,0.) u21d=u11-u*6/tm-y1*6/tm u21=integ(u21d,0.) y1=u21+u u12d=u*1680/(tm*tm*tm*tm)-y2*1680/(tm*tm*tm*tm) u12=integ(u12d,0.) u22d=u12-u*840/(tm*tm*tm)-y2*840/(tm*tm*tm) u22=integ(u22d,0.) u32d=u22+u*180/(tm*tm)-y2*180/(tm*tm) u32=integ(u32d,0.) u42d=u32-u*20/tm-y2*20*tm u42=integ(u42d,0.) y2=u42+u y3=delay(u,tm,#del,ci) cinterval ci=0.01 hdr Pade approximation of dead time prepar y1,y2,y3 output 10,y1,y2,y3 termt(t.ge.tfin) end After the simulation run is finished the results can be displayed as plots.

He ranks among the most prolific book-illustrators and printmakers of the 17th century, working across several genres: natural history, hunting and recreation, politics, and decoration and design. Barlow is known as \\"the father of British sporting painting\\"; he was Britain's first wildlife painter, beginning a tradition that reached a high-point a century later, in the work of George Stubbs. He was furthermore a pioneer in the history of comics by creating A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish Plot (c. 1682), a picture story about the life of Titus Oates and the Popish Plot, which is told in a series of illustrated sequences where the story is written underneath them and the characters depicted on those images use speech balloons to talk. While it is not the first example of its kind in history, it is one of the oldest which is signed. Life Barlow was born c. 1626 in Lincolnshire. The exact day of Barlow's death is unknown but he was buried on 11 August 1704. Joseph Strutt records that Barlow died in poverty: \\"not withstanding all his excellency in design, the multitude of pictures and drawings he appears to have made, and the assistance also of a considerable sum of money, said to have been left to him by a friend, he died in indigent circumstances.\\" Work Barlow's first major work was the illustration (via twelve plates) of poet Edward Benlowe's Theophila (1652). In Barlow's favour, Bullen said in 1885 that \\"the volume [was] valued rather for the engravings than for the text.\\" According to Manchester's Chetham's Library, no two copies of Benlowe's Theophila are the same, and no copy survives in good condition. The Victoria and Albert Museum holds two different copies, one of which includes an original drawing by Barlow. Coursing the Hare, illustration by Barlow to Richard Blome's The Gentleman's Recreation, 1686 Barlow designed the one hundred and ten woodcuts for John Ogilby's translation of Aesop's Fables, published in 1665, several of the plates of which Barlow etched himself. Hugh James Rose observed in the early 19th century that Barlow's \\"chief merit [. . .] as a designer, lay in his exactness in the portrayal of birds, fishes, and animals of all kinds, which are executed in a spirited, and in many instances a masterly manner.\\" One example of this gift is in a set of twelve prints by Wenceslaus Hollar of engravings after drawings by Barlow, entitled Several Ways of Hunting, Hawking, and Fishing, invented by Francis Barlow, engraved by W. Hollar, 1671, published by John Overton. A 2011 article in History Today explored the subtext in examples of Barlow's work: though his wildlife paintings are superb works of art in themselves, they are, at the same time, \\"full of rich metaphors that shed light on the anxieties and concerns of a Britain emerging from the horrors of civil war\\". A case in point is A Decoy, Barlow's allegory on the threat posed to England by Roman Catholicism. In the years leading up to the Glorious Revolution, Barlow became the prime designer of political satire in support of the Whigs; Whig MP Denzil Onslow (1642-1721) acquired or commissioned a number of paintings by Barlow, to decorate his manor house, Pyrford Court. These were more recently housed at Clandon Park, an 18th-century mansion near Guildford, Surrey, becoming one of the largest collections of Barlow's surviving work. Barlow's (and others') work \\"miraculously\\" survived a devastating fire at Clandon Park on 29 April 2015. Examples of Barlow's work can be seen at Ham House (in Ham, south of Richmond in London); examples are held, too, by: Tate Britain, the National Portrait Gallery, the British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Barlow frequently signed the initials of his name, F.B., instead of inserting it at full length, sometimes enclosing the initials in a small circle. Assessment Barlow has come to be regarded as a \\"surprisingly neglected artist\\". Art historian Mark Hallett accounts for this by noting that Barlow's time is British art's \\"forgotten era\\" - one that \\"has tended to be overshadowed by the achievements of earlier artists, such as Van Dyck, or those that came later, such as Hogarth\\"; Hallett finds this unjust: Barlow made a significant contribution to what \\"in reality [. . .] was a remarkably rich, vibrant and cosmopolitan period for the visual arts in Britain.\\" Gallery Catmousebarlow 400.jpgThe Mice in Council, from Ogilby's translation of Aesop's Fables (1665) Seuerall wayes of hunting, hawking and fishing according to the English manner title page.jpgSeuerall wayes of hunting, hawking and fishing according to the English manner, title page; 1671 Playingcardsvanda.jpgPack of playing cards depicting the Popish Plot, c. 1679; V&A; Museum no. 20366: 1 to 52 See alsoEnglish art *List of British artists References Sources Article on the Lambiek Comiclopedia *\\"Francis Barlow, c. 1626-1702\\"; From: A New General Biographical Dictionary, Projected and partly arranged by the late Rev.

Biography He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and moved with his family to Barnegat, New Jersey around 1879 and as a teenager worked as a volunteer lifesaver on the Jersey shore, beginning an enthusiasm for sailing that became a lifelong pursuit. However, his fine baritone voice ‚Äì heard in church and in local concert appearances ‚Äì convinced Collins' family to send him back to Philadelphia for formal training. After concluding his studies, Collins spent some 15 years touring with various stock companies and appearing in summer opera in St. Louis. None of these ventures turned out any long term prospects for Collins, and when he married actress and singer Anna Leah Connelly in 1895 Collins swore off show business and decided to study for a career in bookkeeping. Taking occasional roles for extra money, Collins appeared in a production given by the DeWolf Hopper Opera Company in 1898, and talent scouts for Edison Records requested Collins audition which, according to his wife, took place on May 16, 1898. Within a few years, Collins proved one of the most productive and successful singers in the record business, and in his long career between 1898 and 1926 he worked for every record company active in the United States. He specialized in what were then called coon songs, popular African-American dialect numbers associated with vaudeville and minstrel shows. Collins also utilized an array of vocal effects and caricature voices which gave the impression that there were multiple persons at the horn on his recordings, though it was just Collins. Towards making that end of it more effective, Collins began to work in a duo format with tenor Joe Natus in 1901 and both sang in an Edison group called the Big Four Quartet. It is assumed that Collins first came into contact with tenor Byron G. Harlan within the context of the Big Four Quartet, and from then until the end of Collins' career in the early 1920s, Harlan was Collins's duet partner. Collins & Harlan were probably the most famous and popular male duo on early records. In 1909, Collins joined John H. Meyer, Henry Burr, and Albert Campbell in the Peerless Quartet, a successful barbershop music group which toured as the Record Makers, and later as the Eight Popular Victor Artists. However, by 1917 bass Frank Croxton began to replace Collins on some records, a situation that became permanent by mid-1919 as Collins did not get along with Burr, who also served as the group's manager. During a personal appearance at the Princess Theater in Medina, Ohio on October 20, 1921, Collins was badly injured when he fell through an open trap door. While he recovered well enough to resume his singing and recording career, his health began to decline afterward and in 1926, Collins retired, relocating to Florida with his wife. He died at the age of 69 in Tice, Florida on August 3, 1933. Recordings and legacy Arthur Collins recorded hundreds of songs, and in many cases he recorded the same song multiple times for various recording outfits. His signature song was The Preacher and the Bear, which he first recorded in 1905. His rendition, widely dispersed among a variety of releases, constitutes the most popular non- operatic record made during the first decade of the twentieth century. Collins was still recording the number in 1922, and a 1908 remake of the piece for Victor remained in their catalog until 1941; at his personal appearances \\"The Preacher and the Bear\\" was invariably requested. His recording sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc, only the second one ever presented. Collins lived up to his reputation as the \\"King of Ragtime Singers\\" and recorded more ragtime songs than any other singer during the era when ragtime was at its peak of popularity. Collins recorded some of Bert Williams's songs before Williams did, and even recorded some numbers associated with Williams that the latter never waxed. Collins and Harlan also made best-selling records of tunes old and new that remain well cherished and iconic even in the twenty-first century, such as \\"Waiting for the Robert E. Lee\\", \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\\", \\"Lily of the Valley\\", and \\"The Old Grey Mare\\". Collins survived into the early years of the Jazz Age, and he and Harlan recorded the earliest record known to mention jazz, \\"That Funny Jas Band from Dixieland\\" (Victor 18235, recorded January 12, 1917). Collins' solo recordings as well as Collins and Harlan recordings are viewed as desirable by collectors, particularly the very early ones, and such enthusiasm about their output dates back to at least the 1940s.

A desert ecosystem is defined by interactions between organisms, the climate in which they live, and any other non-living influences on the habitat. Deserts are arid regions that are generally associated with warm temperatures; however, cold deserts also exist. Deserts can be found in every continent, with the largest deserts located in Antarctica, the Arctic, Northern Africa, and the Middle East. Climate Temperatures were 115¬∞F, enough to melt the street signs Deserts experience a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions, and can be classified into four types: hot, semiarid, coastal, and cold. Hot deserts experience warm temperatures year round, and low annual precipitation. Low levels of humidity in hot deserts contribute to high daytime temperatures, and extensive nighttime heat loss. The average annual temperature in hot deserts is approximately 20 to 25 ¬∞C, however, extreme weather conditions can lead to temperatures ranging from -18 to 49 ¬∞C. Rainfall generally occurs, followed by long periods of dryness. Semiarid deserts experience similar conditions to hot deserts, however, the maximum and minimum temperatures tend to be less extreme, and generally range from 10 to 38 ¬∞C. Coastal deserts are cooler than hot and semiarid deserts, with average summer temperatures ranging between 13 and 24 ¬∞C. They also feature higher total rainfall values. Cold deserts are similar in temperature to coastal deserts, however, they receive more annual precipitation in the form of snowfall. Deserts are most notable for their dry climates; usually a result from their surrounding geography. For example, rain-blocking mountain ranges, and distance from oceans are two geographic features that contribute to desert aridity. Rain-blocking mountain ranges create Rain Shadows. As air rises and cools, its relative humidity increases and some or most moisture rains out, leaving little to no water vapor to form precipitation on the other side of the mountain range. Deserts occupy one- fifth of the Earth's land surface and occur in two belts: between 15¬∞ and 35¬∞ latitude in both the southern and northern hemispheres. These bands are associated with the high solar intensities that all areas in the tropics receive, and with the dry air brought down by the descending arms of both the Hadley and Ferell atmospheric circulation cells. Dry winds hold little moisture for these areas, and also tend to evaporate any water present. Many desert ecosystems are limited by available water levels, rather than rates of radiation or temperature. Water flow in these ecosystems can be thought of as similar to energy flow; in fact, it is often useful to look at water and energy flow together when studying desert ecosystems and ecology. Water availability in deserts may also be hindered by loose sediments. Dust clouds commonly form in windy, arid climates. Scientists have previously theorised that desert dust clouds would enhance rainfall, however, some more recent studies have shown that precipitation is actually inhibited by this phenomenon by absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. This absorption of atmospheric moisture can result in a positive feedback loop, which leads to further desertification. Landscape Erosion over time due to wind and rains have created beautiful canyons in the landscape. Antelope Canyon, AZ Desert landscapes can contain a wide variety of geological features, such as oases, rock outcrops, dunes, and mountains. Dunes are structures formed by wind moving sediments into mounds. Desert dunes are generally classified based on their orientation relative to wind directly. Possibly the most recognizable dune type are transverse dunes, characterized by crests transverse to the wind direction. Many dunes are considered to be active, meaning that they can travel and change over time due to the influence of the wind. However, some dunes can be anchored in place by vegetation or topography, preventing their movement. Some dunes may also be referred to as sticky. These types of dunes occur when individual grains of sand become cemented together. Sticky dunes tend to be more stable, and resistant to wind reworking than loose dunes. Barchan, and Seif dunes are among the most common of desert dunes. Barchan dunes are formed as winds continuously blow in the same direction, and are characterized by a crescent-shape atop the dune. Seif dunes are long and narrow, featuring a sharp crest, and are more common in the Sahara Desert. Analysis of geological features in desert environments can reveal a lot about the geologic history of the area. Through observation and identification of rock deposits, geologists are able to interpret the order of events that occurred during desert formation. For example, research conducted on the surface geology of the Namib Desert allowed geologists to interpret ancient movements of the Kuiseb River based on rock ages and features identified in the area. Organism adaptation The high body temperatures of bactrian camels allow them to preserve water. =Animals= Deserts support diverse communities of plant and animals that have evolved resistance, and circumventing methods of extreme temperatures and arid conditions. For example, desert grasslands are more humid and slightly cooler than its surrounding ecosystems. Many animals obtain energy by eating the surrounding vegetation, however, desert plants are much more difficult for organisms to consume. To avoid intense temperatures, the majority of small desert mammals are nocturnal, living in burrows to avoid the intense desert sun during the daytime. These burrows prevent overheating and dehydration as they maintain an optimal temperature for the mammal. Desert ecology is characterized by dry, alkaline soils, low net production and opportunistic feeding patterns by herbivores and carnivores. Other organisms' survival tactics are physiologically based. Such tactics include the completion of life cycles ahead of anticipated drought seasons, and storing water with the help of specialized organs. Desert climates are particularly demanding on endothermic organisms. However, endothermic organisms have adapted mechanisms to aid in water retention in habitats such as desert ecosystems which are commonly affected by drought. In environments where the external temperature is less than their body temperature, most endotherms are able to balance heat production and heat loss to maintain a comfortable temperature. However, in deserts where air and ground temperatures exceed body temperature, endotherms must be able to dissipate the large amounts of heat being absorbed in these environments. In order to cope with extreme conditions, desert endotherms have adapted through the means of avoidance, relaxation of homeostasis, and specializations. Nocturnal desert rodents, like the kangaroo rat, will spend the daytime in cool burrows deep underground, and emerge at night to seek food. Birds are much more mobile than ground-dwelling endotherms, and can therefore avoid heat-induced dehydration by flying between water sources. To prevent overheating, the body temperatures of many desert mammals have adapted to be much higher than non-desert mammals. Camels, for example, can maintain body temperatures that are about equal to typical desert air temperatures. This adaptations allows camels to retain large amounts of water for extended periods of time. Other examples of higher body temperature in desert mammals include the diurnal antelope ground squirrel, and the oryx. Certain desert endotherms have evolved very specific and unique characteristics to combat dehydration. Male sandgrouse have specialized belly feathers that are able to trap and carry water. This allows the sandgrouse to provide a source of hydration for their chicks, who do not yet have the ability to fly to water sources themselves. old man cactus help deflect strong desert sunlight.left = Plants = Although deserts have severe climates, some plants still manage to grow. Plants that can survive in arid deserts are called xerophytes, meaning they are able to survive long dry periods. Such plants may close their stomata during the daytime and open them again at night. During the night, temperatures are much cooler, and plants will experience less water loss, and intake larger amounts of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Adaptations in xerophytes include resistance to heat and water loss, increased water storage capabilities, and reduced surface area of leaves. One of the most common families of desert plants are the cacti, which are covered in sharp spines or bristles for defence against herbivory. The bristles on certain cacti also have the ability to reflect sunlight, such as those of the old man cactus. Certain xerophytes, like oleander, feature stomata that are recessed as a form of protection against hot, dry desert winds, which allows the leaves to retain water more effectively. Another unique adaptation can be found in xerophytes like ocotillo, which are \\"leafless during most of the year, thereby avoiding excessive water loss\\". There are also plants called phreatophytes which have adapted to the harsh desert conditions by developing extremely long root systems, some of which are 80 ft. long; to reach the water table which ensures a water supply to the plant. Exploration and research The harsh climate of most desert regions is a major obstacle in conducting research into these ecosystems. In the environments requiring special adaptations to survive, it is often difficult or even impossible for researchers to spend extended periods of time investigating the ecology of such regions. To overcome the limitations imposed by desert climates, some scientists have used technological advancements in the area of remote sensing and robotics. One such experiment, conducted in 1997, had a specialised robot named Nomad travel through a portion of the Atacama Desert. During this expedition, Nomad travelled over 200 kilometres and provided the researchers with many photographs of sites visited along its path.

In 1956, after Lim Yew Hock replaced David Marshall as Chief Minister of Singapore, he began to take tough measures to suppress communist activities with the support of the British Governor and Commissioner of Police. In September, Lim Yew Hock deregistered and banned two pro-communist organizations: the Singapore Women‚Äôs Association (SWA) and the Chinese Musical Gong Society. The Singapore Chinese Middle School Students Union (SCMSSU) was also dissolved. The riots came about when Lim Yew Hock announced that the Singapore Chinese Middle School Students' Union would be closed due to its communist activities. The government also arrested four student leaders and expelled 142 students. In protest, students gathered and camped at Chung Cheng High School and The Chinese High School. They sat-in over the next two weeks, organizing meetings and holding demonstrations. On 24 October, the government issued an ultimatum that the schools be vacated. As the deadline approached, riots started at the Chinese High School and spread to other parts of the island. The government decided to take action. On 26 October 1956, the police entered the schools and cleared the students using tear gas. Forced out from the schools, the students headed for the city. They overturned cars and damaged traffic lights. They also threw stones and bottles. Over the next five days, 13 people were killed and more than 100 were injured. Some nine hundred people were arrested, including Lim Chin Siong, Fong Swee Suan and Devan Nair. They were released in 1959 when the People's Action Party, led by Lee Kuan Yew, won the 1959 general election to form the government as Singapore gained self rule.

Background \\"Subsidiary Communications Authorization\\" is the United States Federal Communications Commission's official designation for this type of service. SCA was deregulated in 1983; since then, both AM and FM licensed broadcast stations have been allowed to use subcarriers in the United States in general without requiring separate authority; authorization is only required for some uses which are still otherwise regulated, such as common carrier or Land Mobile Radio Service transmissions. The fidelity (bandwidth) of SCA channels on FM is generally quite limited compared to that of the main program material, resulting in audio quality similar to AM radio broadcasting. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) calls this service \\"Subsidiary Communications Multiplex Operation\\" (SCMO). SCMO for internal uses by the radio station, such as internal monitoring and cue control, are allowed under the normal broadcasting certificate. Non-broadcasting uses are allowed when the type of use is authorized under other radio and telecommunications acts, and may require a fee. In Australia, the service is called \\"Ancillary Communications Service\\" (ACS) and the Radio Data System is specifically addressed by government guidelines. Subcarrier channels falling under the description of SCA are usually on FM at 67 kHz and 92 kHz from the main carrier, and 67 kHz is the most common. Major uses of SCA include: * For talking book/radio reading service for the blind: usually carried on NPR- affiliated public radio stations in the United States. In Canada, this is usually provided by AMI-audio over television second audio programs instead. * As a transmitter/studio link, sending telemetry data from a broadcast FM station's transmitter to the studio for monitoring the condition of the transmitter * For commercial paging service: sent via FM subcarrier to the subscriber with a compatible pager * For data broadcasting: Microsoft's now- defunct DirectBand service (used by MSN Direct) relied on SCA FM subcarriers; Data Broadcasting Corporation's Signal service used SCA for sending real-time stock quotes. * For closed-circuit or specialized radio programming aimed at certain markets or professions, such as the Physician's Radio Network, agricultural commodity & futures information (via voice or data), or ethnic foreign-language radio programming. * For the transmission of Muzak's background music service to its subscribers (i.e., supermarkets, restaurants, etc.), this transmission method (along with another method using leased phone lines) have been phased out with Muzak now transmitting its programming via satellite. Receiving the SCA Signal Most programming transmitted by SCA/SCMO is usually pay/subscription-based, making unauthorized reception of such programming illegal, but programming which is not commercial in nature, such as reading services, can be received legally. Companies in the past such as Norver, ComPol, Mani National Corporation, McMartin, & Dayton Industrial; and current companies such as Metrosonix make radios and adapters for receiving SCA/SCMO channels. It can be difficult to keep the main channel's FM stereo difference subcarrier from interfering with such SCA decoders, as the stereo signal is a much stronger signal, and distortions due to multipath can also cause problems.

Wasson, 842 S.W.2d 487 (Ky. 1992), was a 1992 Kentucky Supreme Court decision striking down that state's criminalization of consensual sodomy between same-sex partners, holding that this was a violation of both the equal protection of the laws and the right to privacy. The Kentucky case helped pave the way for many other states and eventually the United States Supreme Court to issue similar rulings. The law at issue At that time, Kentucky law criminalized consensual sexual relations between people of the same sex, even if conducted in private. Specifically, the law criminalized genital-oral (oral sex), genital-anal (anal sex), and anal-oral (rimming) sex -but only between partners of the same sex. Such sexual activities between mixed-sex (male- female) couples were legal. Such conduct was a misdemeanor punishable by up to 12 months in jail and a fine of up to $500. Solicitation of same was also a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a fine of up to $250. Historically, Kentucky's sodomy statutes had changed over time. The 1860 sodomy statute criminalized anal penetration by a penis and applied to both male-female couples and male-male couples. Because the law focused exclusively on penile-anal penetration, consensual sex between women was technically legal in Kentucky until 1974. In fact, in 1909 the Kentucky Supreme Court issued a ruling in Commonwealth v. Poindexter involving two African-American men arrested for consensual oral sex. In this decision the court upheld that the then current sodomy law did not criminalize oral sex but only anal sex. In 1974 Kentucky revised its statutes as part of a penal code reform advocated by the American Law Institute. While the American Law Institute urged states to decriminalize consensual sodomy and other victimless crimes, the Kentucky legislature chose to decriminalize anal sex involving male-female couples but to broaden the new statute to criminalize anal-genital, oral-genital, and oral-anal sexual contact involving same-sex couples (both male-male and female-female couples). Thus, the 1974 revised statute decriminalized consensual anal sex for mixed-sex couples but expanded criminalization of sexual acts to include both male and female same-sex couples. Factual background Jeffrey Wasson, a 23-year-old nursing student, was arrested in 1986 and charged with solicitation of same-sex sodomy as the result of an undercover sting operation conducted by the Lexington police. The police selected an area and conversed with men to see if they would be solicited for sex under the 1974 statute defining fourth degree sodomy as actual or solicitation of consensual sodomy. As Wasson left The Bar Complex, a Lexington gay bar, to walk to his car, an undercover officer engaged Wasson in the parking lot and taped approximately 20 minutes of a conversation with Wasson. Near the end of the conversation Wasson invited the officer to come home with him. When prodded for details, Wasson suggested sexual activities that violated the Kentucky statute prohibiting homosexual activity. Wasson was one of 29 men arrested during this police sting. Rather than paying the fine, he sought legal representation to contest the law. In its recitation of the facts, the Kentucky Supreme Court noted that there \\"was no suggestion that sexual activity would occur anyplace other than in the privacy of Wasson's home. The sexual activity was intended to have been between consenting adults. No money was offered or solicited.\\" The initial trial court, Fayette District Court, dismissed the charges holding that the law was unconstitutional. Upon appeal, the Fayette Circuit Court reached the same conclusion. The Commonwealth appealed that decision. The Kentucky Supreme Court granted a transfer, bypassing the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Kentucky Supreme Court decision On September 24, 1992, in a 4‚Äì3 ruling, the Court struck down anti- sodomy laws in effect since 1860, declaring them unconstitutional under Kentucky law with the declaration that it violated both the right to privacy and the right to equal protection under the law found in the Kentucky Constitution. Justice Charles M.

Jeffery Wasson, 842 S.W.2d 487. The decision was handed down on September 24, 1992. The case was among the early ones to strike down same-sex sodomy laws on the grounds that such laws violated the Equal Protection doctrine. Four other states preceded Kentucky in striking down same-sex sodomy laws. New York in New York v. OnofreNew York v. Onofre, 51 N.Y.2d 476, 434 N.Y.S.2d 947, 415 N.E.2d 936 (1980). and Pennsylvania in Commonwealth v. BonadioCommonwealth v. Bonadio, 490 Pa. 91, 415 A.2d 47 (1980). did so on grounds similar to those cited by the Kentucky Supreme Court. A lower appellate court in Texas and the Wayne County Circuit Court in Michigan had also struck down same-sex sodomy laws by that time, though neither state's highest court had yet issued such a holding. Those cases were State v. Morales and Michigan Organization for Human Rights v. Kelley.Michigan Organization for Human Rights v. Kelley, No. 88- 815820(CZ) (Wayne County Circuit Court, July 9, 1990). Citing these cases, the Kentucky court wrote: \\"Thus our decision, rather than being the leading edge of change, is but a part of the moving stream.\\" In time this statement was proven correct, as other states and eventually the United States Supreme Court reached the same conclusion as Kentucky had in Wasson. At the time, the decision - which was based solely on interpretation of the Kentucky Constitution - was at odds with federal case law on the same subject. The United States Supreme Court had previously held in Bowers v. Hardwick. that federal constitutional protection of the right of privacy was not implicated in laws penalizing homosexual sodomy. It was not until years after the Wasson case that the United States Supreme Court revisited the issue and reversed its holding in Lawrence v. Texas..

Anthony Powell was charged with a complaint in which he had performed non-consensual oral sex upon his wife's 17-year-old niece in his house. The jury acquitted him of the non-consensual portion of the complaint, but convicted him of consensual sodomy. In its appeal, the defense argued the statute was unconstitutional; the state argued that a conviction such as this was explicitly upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986). In Bowers, the Attorney General of Georgia had conceded that the sodomy law could not be applied to married heterosexuals, given the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut. Justice John Paul Stevens had observed in his Bowers dissent that Eisenstadt v. Baird had extended Griswold to unmarried heterosexuals, so the sodomy law should not apply to unmarried heterosexuals either. The Georgia Supreme Court struck down the sodomy statute by a vote of 6‚Äì1. The Court found that the individual's right to privacy in the Georgia Constitution are stronger and broader than those in the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment. The majority noted that \\"privacy rights protected by the U.S. Constitution are not at issue in this case,\\" while the dissenting justice cited Bowers extensively. Powell's conviction was overturned. Although this case involved heterosexual activity, the decision overturned the state's sodomy law and had the effect of making homosexual sexual activity legal in the State of Georgia. Sodomy laws were overturned nationwide five years later, when Lawrence v. Texas (2003) overruled Bowers v. Hardwick.

The parent molecules' molecular formula is 333. They exist in three isomeric forms, 1,3,5-triazines being common.  Structure  The triazines have planar six-membered benzene-like ring but with three carbons replaced by nitrogens. The three isomers of triazine are distinguished by the positions of their nitrogen atoms, and are referred to as 1,2,3-triazine, 1,2,4-triazine, and 1,3,5-triazine. Other aromatic nitrogen heterocycles are pyridines with one ring nitrogen atom, diazines with 2 nitrogen atoms in the ring, triazoles with 3 nitrogens in a 5 membered ring, and tetrazines with 4 ring nitrogen atoms.  Uses  =Melamine= A well known triazine is melamine (2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine). With three amino substituents, melamine is a precursor to commercial resins. Guanamines are closely related to melamine, except with one amino substituent replaced by an organic group. This difference is exploited in the use of guanamines to modify the crosslinking density in melamine resins. Some commercially important guanamines are benzoguanamine and acetoguanamine. Structure of a guanamine, R = alkyl, aryl, etc. =Cyanuric chloride= Another important triazine is cyanuric chloride (2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine). Chlorine-substituted triazines are components of reactive dyes.Horst Tappe, Walter Helmling, Peter Mischke, Karl Rebsamen, Uwe Reiher, Werner Russ, Ludwig Schl√§fer and Petra Vermehren \\"Reactive Dyes\\"in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. These compounds react through a chlorine group with hydroxyl groups present in cellulose fibres in nucleophilic substitution, the other triazine positions contain chromophores. Triazine compounds are often used as the basis for various herbicides. =Other= Triazines also have wide use in the oil and gas and petroleum processing industries as a non- regenerating sulfide removal agent; they are applied to fluid streams to remove hydrogen sulfide gas and mercaptan species, which can decrease the quality of the processed hydrocarbon and be harmful to pipeline and facility infrastructure if not removed.  Synthesis  The more common 1,3,5-isomers are prepared by trimerization of nitrile and cyanide compounds, although more specialized methods are known. The 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-Triazines are more specialized methods. The former family of triazines can be synthesized by thermal rearrangement of 2-azidocyclopropenes. Also mainly of specialized interest, the 1,2,4-isomer is prepared from condensation of 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds with amidrazones. A classical synthesis is also the Bamberger triazine synthesis.  Reactions  Although triazines are aromatic compounds, their resonance energy is much lower than in benzene. Electrophilic aromatic substitution is difficult but nucleophilic aromatic substitution easier than typical chlorinated benzenes. 2,4,6-Trichloro-1,3,5-triazine is easily hydrolyzed to cyanuric acid by heating with water. 2,4,6-Tris(phenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine results when the trichloride is treated with phenol. With amines, one or more chloride is displaced. The remaining chlorides are reactive, and this theme is the basis of the large field of reactive dyes. Cyanuric chloride assists in the amidation of carboxylic acids.Triazine-Promoted Amidation of Various Carboxylic Acids Jeremy Schlarb 1999 Article The 1,2,4-triazines can react with electron-rich dienophiles in an inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction. This forms a bicyclic intermediate which normally then extrudes a molecule of nitrogen gas to form an aromatic ring again. In this way the 1,2,4-triazines can be reacted with alkynes to form pyridine rings. An alternative to using an alkyne is to use norbornadiene which can be thought of as a masked alkyne.Shi, B.; Lewis, W.; Campbell, I. B.; Moody, C. J. Org. Lett., 2009, 3686-3688 In 2007, a method for synthesizing highly porous triazine-based polymers was discovered, and found to be useful (in conjunction with palladium) for the selective reduction of phenols.https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&date;=20101104&DB;=EPODOC&CC;=US&NR;=2010280216A1&KC;=A1http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/179610_en.html =Ligands= A series of 1,2,4-triazine derivatives known as bis-triazinyl bipyridines (BTPs) have been considered as possible extractants for use in the advanced nuclear reprocessing.Development Of Electrochemical Separations Of Uranium And Re Elements From Fluoride Melts BTPs are molecules containing a pyridine ring bonded to two 1,2,4-triazin-3-yl groups.

A burgage was a town (\\"borough\\" or \\"burgh\\") rental property (to use modern terms), owned by a king or lord. The property (\\"burgage tenement\\") usually, and distinctly, consisted of a house on a long and narrow plot of land (Scots: toft), with a narrow street frontage. Rental payment (\\"tenure\\") was usually in the form of money, but each \\"burgage tenure\\" arrangement was unique, and could include services. As populations grew, \\"burgage plots\\" could be split into smaller additional units. (Amalgamation was not so common, until the second half of the 19th century.T. R. Slater, The Analysis of Burgage Patterns in Medieval Towns) Burgage tenures were usually money based, in contrast to rural tenures which were usually services based. In Saxon times the rent was called a landgable or hawgable. History Burgage was the basis of the right to vote in many boroughs sending members to the House of Commons before 1832. In these boroughs the right to vote was attached to the occupation of particular burgage tenements. These burgages could be freely bought and sold, and the owner of the tenement was entitled to convey the right vote, for the duration of the election, to another person, their \\"nominee\\", who could then vote. The vote of each person entitled to the franchise was a matter of public record. Therefore the owner could monitor their nominees' votes. By purchasing the majority of the burgages one rich person could acquire the right to elect a Member of Parliament. Such burgage boroughs were called pocket boroughs. Most of the burgage boroughs had become pocket boroughs in this way by the time of the Great Reform Act 1832. The practice was abolished by the Act, which applied a uniform voting right to all boroughs. In medieval England and Scotland, and some parts of the Welsh Marches, burgage plots or burgage tenements were inclosed fields extending the confines of a town, established by the lord of the manor, as divisions of the 'open' manorial fields. The burgesses (equivalents of \\"burghers\\") to whom these tracts were allotted, as tenants of the enclosed lands, paid a cash rent instead of, as previously, feudal service. In 1207, for instance, Maurice Paynell, the Lord of the Manor of Leeds, granted a charter to 'his burgesses of Leeds' to build a 'new town', and so created the first borough of Leeds, Briggate, a street running north from the River Aire.Discovering Leeds These burgesses had to be freemen: those who were entitled to practise a trade within the town and to participate in electing members of the town's ruling council. In the very earliest chartered foundations, predating the Norman Conquest, the burgage plots were simply the ploughland strips of pre-existing agrarian settlements. In towns like Burford in Oxfordshire and Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, Bromyard in Herefordshire, and Cricklade in Wiltshire, the property on the road frontage extends in a very long garden plot behind the dwelling even today, as English property boundaries have remained very stable. In South Zeal, in Devon, burgage plots were known as \\"borough acres\\".http://www.dartmoor- npa.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/42396/laf-szburgage.pdf The basic unit of measurement was the perch which was 5.5 yards (5.03 m) and the plots can be identified today because they are in multiples of perches: at Cricklade most were 2 by 12 perches (10.1 by 60.4 m), while at Charmouth in Dorset, a charter of the year 1320 provided plots 4 perches wide and 20 perches long (about 20 by 100 m), giving a typical plot size of half an acre (0.2 hectare), held at an annual rent of 6d.Wiltshire County Council Burgage grants were also common in Ireland; for example, when the town of Wexford received its royal charter in 1418, English settlers were encouraged into the town and were given burgage plots at a rent of one shilling per year. The term was translated into Irish as buir√≠os, and the element \\"Borris\\" survives in many Irish place names.

They were also known as the \\"First Fruits\\"' ('), a concept which dates back to earlier Greek, Roman, and Hebrew religions. History This custom was only of gradual growth. At a very early period bishops who received episcopal consecration in Rome were wont to present gifts to the various ecclesiastical authorities concerned.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 13 May 2019 The jus deportuum, annalia or annatae, was originally the right of the bishop to claim the first year's profits of the living from a newly inducted incumbent, of which the first mention is found under Pope Honorius III (d. 1227), but which had its origin in a custom, dating from the 6th century, by which those ordained to ecclesiastical offices paid a fee or tax to the ordaining bishop. Originally, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, annat√¶ or annalia, signified only the first-fruits of those lesser benefices of which the pope had reserved the patronage to himself, and granted outside of the consistory. It was from these claims that the papal annates, in the strict sense, in course of time developed. These accrues to the Apostolic Camera (Papal treasury ). The earliest records show the annata to have been, sometimes a privilege conceded to the bishop for a term of years, sometimes a right based on immemorial precedent. In course of time the popes, under stress of financial crises, claimed the privilege for themselves, though at first only temporarily. Thus, in 1305, Pope Clement V claimed the first-fruits of all vacant benefices in England, and in 1319 Pope John XXII those of all Christendom vacated within the next two years. In those cases the rights of the bishops were frankly usurped by the Holy See, now regarded as the ultimate source of the episcopal jurisdiction. Classification These annates may be divided broadly into four classes, though the chief features are common to all: # the ' or ': a payment by an abbot, bishop, or archbishop, due upon his induction, of the anticipated revenue of the next year in his new benefice. This payment is traceable to the ' paid to the pope when consecrating bishops as metropolitans or patriarchs. When, in the middle of the 13th century, the consecration of bishops became established as the sole right of the pope, the oblations of all bishops of the West were received by him; by the close of the 14th century, these became fixed at one year's revenue. # the , , or ': the annates due to the bishop or archbishop for benefices under his control but \\"reserved\\" by the church for the maintenance of the Papacy. # the ': the annates of benefices attached to communities or corporations, which‚Äîunder a 1469 bull of Paul II‚Äîwere not paid at every presentation but instead offered every fifteen years. # the ': a small additional payment eventually added to other annates as a kind of notarial fee. National variation It must not be supposed that this system ever was worked with absolute uniformity and completeness throughout the various parts of Catholic Christendom. There were continual disagreements and disputes: the central authorities endeavoring to maintain and extend this most important of their financial schemes and the subordinate ecclesiastics doing their best to get rid of the impost altogether or to transmute it into some less objectionable form. The easy expedient of rewarding the officials of the Curia and increasing the papal revenue by \\"reserving\\" more and more benefices was met by repeated protests, such as that of the bishops and barons of England (the chief sufferers), headed by Robert Grosseteste of Lincoln, at the council of Lyons in 1245. The subject frequently became one of national interest, on account of the alarming amount of specie which was thus drained away, and hence numerous enactments exist in regard to it by the various national governments. =Britain= In the Kingdom of England, which included Wales after the English conquest of 1277 to 1283, the annates were originally paid for the most part to the archbishop of Canterbury, but were claimed for three years by in the early 14th century and permanently usurped by his successors. The payments were originally governed by a valuation made by Walter Suffield, the bishop of Norwich, for in 1254; this was emended by Nicholas III in 1292. In 1531 or 1532, the total payments comprised around ¬£3,000 a year and prohibited their collection. In 1534, Thomas Cromwell obtained from parliament the Act in Restraint of Annates, which restored the annates as a payment owed to the Crown. A new valuation was established by the commissioners who wrote the King's Books () in 1535. In February 1704, they were granted by Queen Anne to the assistance of the poorer clergy, a scheme since known as \\"Queen Anne's Bounty\\". The 1535 valuations were still in use in 1704, and their continued use was inherent in the Act setting up Queen Anne's Bounty; consequently the 'first fruits' payments did not increase to reflect the true value of livings; by 1837, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners reported first fruits to bring in ¬£4,000-5,000 a year whereas church income was around ¬£3m a year and the true value of first fruits would therefore have been over ¬£150,000 a year. In Scotland, the annat or ann is half a year's stipend allowed to the executors of a minister of the Church of Scotland above what was due to him at the time of his death.Act 1672, c. 13 This is neither assignable by the clergyman during his life nor can it be seized by his creditors. =France= In France, in spite of royal edicts and even denunciations of the Sorbonne, at least the custom of paying the servitia communia held its ground until the famous decree of August 4 during the French Revolution in 1789. =Germany= In Germany it was decided by the concordat of Constance, in 1418, that bishoprics and abbacies should pay the servitia according to the valuation of the Roman chancery in two half-yearly installments. Those reserved benefices only were to pay the annalia which were rated above twenty-four gold florins; and as none were so rated, whatever their annual value may have been, the annalia fell into disuse. A similar convenient fiction also led to their practical abrogation in France, Spain and Belgium. The council of Basel (1431‚Äì1443) wished to abolish the servitia, but the concordat of Vienna (1448) confirmed the Constance decision. Politically the collection was opposed by Martin Luther his 1520 To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, in which he wrote:An Open Letter to The Christian Nobility by Martin Luther (1483-1546), iclnet.org The practice of collecting servitia continued through the Reformation, in spite of the efforts of the congress of Ems (1786) to alter it, still remains nominally in force. As a matter of fact, however, the revolution caused by the secularization of the ecclesiastical states in 1803 practically put an end to the system, and the servitia have either been commuted via gratiae to a moderate fixed sum under particular concordats, or are the subject of separate negotiation with each bishop on his appointment. In Prussia, where the bishops received salaries as state officials, the payment was made by the government.

An hour south of Bozeman via U.S. Highway 191 in Big Sky, Montana, it is the second-largest ski resort in the United States by acreage. Opened in late 1973, Big Sky Resort has more than of terrain and a vertical drop of , In July 2013, Big Sky Resort acquired on Spirit Mountain, which were previously owned by Spanish Peaks, a private club. In October of the same year, Big Sky Resort acquired the terrain and facilities of Moonlight Basin, a neighboring resort that shared the northern exposure of Lone Mountain. Big Sky Resort also offers meeting space for conferences, weddings, and corporate retreats. Resort history The resort was founded by Montana native Chet Huntley, the retired co-anchorman of The Huntley‚ÄìBrinkley Report of NBC News. Big Sky opened in December 1973, with its main base area at an elevation of above sea level, on the eastern face of the Lone Mountain, the sixty-seventh highest mountain in Montana, and the seventh- highest mountain in the state outside of the Beartooth Range. The first three lifts installed included a gondola and two chairlifts. The enclosed gondola carried four skiers per cabin, and climbed to an elevation of . The nearby Lone Peak triple chairlift provided the lift-served maximum of , unloading at the bowl beneath Lone Mountain's summit, providing a vertical drop of just under , and the Explorer double chair served novice terrain just above the base. The fourth lift was the Andesite double, which climbed the north face of adjacent Andesite Mountain to ; it was renamed Ram's Horn in 1978, and replaced with the Ramcharger high speed quad in 1990. Boyne Resorts purchased the resort in 1976, following Huntley's death from cancer in March 1974, and the decision of owner Chrysler Corporation to divest its real estate development assets. Lone Peak, the top of the resort mountain The resort grew steadily over the following decades, adding lifts and more than tripling the terrain available for skiing and snowboarding. The fifth lift, a second chairlift on Andesite Mountain, was installed in the summer of 1979. The Mad Wolf double climbed Andesite's eastern face and lowered Big Sky's minimum elevation to . This increased the area's vertical drop to over . The Mad Wolf lift was replaced with the Thunder Wolf high speed quad in 1994. Two lifts were added in the 1980s, Gondola Two was installed in parallel to the first gondola, and the Challenger double chair served upper-elevation expert terrain on the north edge of the ski area. A tow was later added above this lift. Gondola Two was replaced with a Doppelmayr high speed quad, Swift Current 4, in 1997. The eighth lift at Big Sky was the Southern Comfort on the south side of Andesite Mountain, a Heron-Poma triple chairlift acquired from Copper Mountain in Colorado, installed in 1990 and upgraded to a high speed quad for the 2004-2005 ski season. In the fall of 1995, Big Sky installed the Lone Peak Tram to provide access to expert terrain from the Lone Mountain summit. The Shedhorn double chair was also part of this expansion, installed in 1995 on the lower south face of Lone Mountain. The tram increased Big Sky's vertical drop to . The minimum elevation was lowered further in the fall of 1999, with the addition of a used triple chairlift from Keystone Resort in Colorado, starting at a base elevation of at Lone Moose Meadows. This increased the ski area's total vertical drop to , with the maximum continuous vertical drop increased to from the top of the tram to the main base area. In 1990 the Shoshone Condominium Hotel and the Yellowstone Conference Center were built. In April 2000, Boyne Resorts announced that an estimated $400 million in improvements would take place over the next ten years to the Mountain Village and the ski area. Later in 2000, the $54 million Summit Hotel was completed. In late 2007, the $25 million Village Center Complex was opened. In 2007, Big Sky expanded the skiing opportunities on the south face of Lone Peak with the reinstallation of the original Southern Comfort triple chairlift as the Dakota chairlift on the south side of Lone Peak, providing access to the accompanying out-of-bounds sidecountry, Dakota Territory. Gondola One was retired in the summer of 2008, dismantled due to the rising cost of repairs. Big Sky's neighbor on its north boundary, Moonlight Basin, merged with Big Sky Resort in October 2013. In 2016, Big Sky Resort installed two new Doppelmayr chairlifts as part of BigSky2025, a 10-year, $150-million project. The Lone Peak triple chairlift in the bowl was replaced with Powder Seeker, a six-seat high-speed chairlift with heated seats and bubble covers. The same summer, the Challenger double chairlift, which had suffered a mechanical failure, was replaced by a triple chairlift with a conveyor load. In 2018, as part of the Big Sky 2025 plan, Doppelmay built North America's first ever high speed eight pack in the form of the Ramcharger 8, which replaced an existing Doppelmayr high speed quad from the base area to the summit of Andesite Mountain and has many of the same features as Powder Seeker. Billed as \\"the most technologically advanced lift ever built,\\" it opened on December 15, 2018. That same season, the original Ramcharger high speed quad was relocated to the south side of Lone Peak where it replaced the Shedhorn double chairlift. Activities Winter activities include skiing and snowboarding, seven terrain parks, zip-line, and snowshoeing. Summer attractions include zip-lines, archery, tennis, hiking, and mountain biking trails on the mountain. Golf and horseback riding are available near the Meadow Village at an elevation of , between the ski area and US-191. =Terrain Aspects - Skiing= North: 37% * West: 2% * East: 36% * South: 25% Lone Peak Tram Lone Peak Tram, January 2018 The Lone Peak Tram is an aerial tramway at the Big Sky Resort that begins at the top of the Powder Seeker chairlift and unloads at the summit of Lone Mountain at . Opened in the fall of 1995, the 15 passenger cab climbs over a distance of , with two cabs traveling in opposite directions. It provides access to the most difficult terrain at Big Sky Resort, including former Moonlight Basin terrain. Construction was completed by the high-altitude construction firm Matrix, based in Alaska. Starting in the summer 2012 season, Big Sky Resort introduced daily summer tram rides to take visitors to the top of Lone Peak, called The Lone Peak Expedition.

It is part of the top-western group of the Torres Strait Islands, which lie in the Torres Strait separating Cape York Peninsula from the island of New Guinea. The mainland of Papua New Guinea is only away from Boigu. Boigu has an area of . Boigu is also the name of the town and Boigu Island is the name of the locality on the island within the Torres Strait Island Region. It is the largest and only inhabited island of the Talbot Islands group of the Torres Strait Islands. Language and affiliations The language of Boigu is that of the Western and Central Islands of the Torres Strait. The specific dialect is Kalau Kawau Ya, also spoken on the islands of Dauan and Saibai. The people of the three islands consider themselves as one people. Kala Kawaw Ya (also known as Kalaw Kawaw, KKY) is one of the languages of the Torres Strait. Kala Kawaw Ya is the traditional language owned by the Top Western islands of the Torres Strait. The Kala Kawaw Ya language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Torres Shire Council. History Boigu was visited by South Sea Islander missionaries of the London Missionary Society, some time after the establishment of a mission on nearby Saibai Island in 1871. From the 1870s to around 1910, the Boigu, Dauan and Saibai people, along with the neighbouring Papuan peoples, were being harassed by thugeral \\"warriors\\" from the Marind-anim, fierce headhunters from what is now southeast West Papua. In literature dealing with the period, these people are generally termed 'Tuger' or 'Tugeri'. Sir William MacGregor, the Lieutenant-Governor of British New Guinea, noted in 1886 that the population was nearly extinct as a result of these raids. What he did not realise was that at the time the bulk of the population were staying with family on Saibai and Dauan for mutual protection. Geography Boigu is approximately long, and low-lying. It was formed by the accumulation of alluvial sediments deposited by the discharge of nearby New Guinean rivers into the Strait. These sediments built up over time on an old coral platform which rises from the shallow continental shelf, eventually creating the island. Most of the island is subject to extensive periodic flooding, and as a result the community township has been built on the highest ground. Satellite image of Boigu Island. Two nearby smaller islands (not permanently settled) are considered as a part of Boigu island, more accurately of the Talbot Islands, these are Aubusi Island and Moimi Island. Ecology The island is considered part of the New Guinea mangroves ecoregion, a subset of the Australasian realm. The interior of the island is sparsely vegetated, and mainly swampland. The coast is fringed by mangroves, which act to protect against the island's sand and mud from sea erosion. It is likely the mangrove regions harbour healthy populations of saltwater crocodile. The waters surrounding the island are an important habitat for dugongs, a species of sea mammal listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. Population Boigu is predominantly inhabited by indigenous Torres Strait Islanders. According to 2004 Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) figures, its resident population is approximately 340. Currently there are approximately 260 people living on the island (2008). The village of Boigu at the northern end of the island is the northernmost settlement of Australia. The northernmost island, however, is Bramble Cay, to the east.  Amenities  The Torres Strait Island Regional Council operate an Indigenous Knowledge Centre at 66 Chamber Street.

Since 2004, an exception has existed for therapeutic, dental, nicotine chewing gum, which can be bought from a doctor or registered pharmacist. It is currently not illegal to chew gum in Singapore, merely to import it and sell it, apart from the aforementioned exceptions. Origins =Lee Kuan Yew= In his memoirs,Lee Kuan Yew (2000). From Third World to First: The Singapore Story. Lee Kuan Yew said that in 1983, when he was Prime Minister of Singapore, a proposal for the ban was brought to him by Teh Cheang Wan, then Minister for National Development. Chewing gum was causing maintenance problems in high- rise public-housing apartments, with vandals disposing of spent gum in mailboxes, inside keyholes, and on lift buttons. Chewing gum left on the ground, stairways, and pavements in public areas increased the cost of cleaning and damaged cleaning equipment. Gum stuck on the seats of public buses was also considered a problem. However, Lee thought that a ban would be \\"too drastic\\". =Mass rapid transport and implementation= In 1987, the $5 billion local railway system, the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), started running. It was then the largest public project ever implemented in Singapore. It was reported that vandals had begun sticking chewing gum on the door sensors of MRT trains, preventing doors from functioning properly and causing disruption to train services. Such incidents were rare but costly and culprits were difficult to apprehend. In January 1992, Goh Chok Tong, who had just taken over as Prime Minister, decided on a ban. The restriction on the distribution of chewing gum was enacted in Singapore Statute Chapter 57, the Control of Manufacture Act, which also governs the restriction of certain alcohol and tobacco products. Results After the ban was announced, the importation of chewing gum was immediately halted. After a transition period allowing shops to clear existing stock, the sale of chewing gum was completely banned. When first introduced, the ban caused much controversy and some open defiance. Some people took the trouble of travelling to neighbouring Johor Bahru, Malaysia, to purchase chewing gum. Offenders were publicly \\"named and shamed\\" by the government, to serve as a deterrent to other would-be smugglers. No black market for chewing gum in Singapore ever emerged, though some Singaporeans occasionally still manage to smuggle some chewing gum from Johor Bahru for their own consumption. The ban has been partially lifted, as some types of gum are allowable, such as gum chewed for dental health. However, the government refuses to completely lift the ban due to the risk of gum littering again. International attention In the mid 1990s, Singapore's laws began to receive international press coverage. US media paid great attention to the case of Michael P. Fay, an American teenager sentenced in 1994 to caning in Singapore for vandalism (using spray paint, not chewing gum). They also drew attention to some of Singapore's other laws, including the \\"mandatory flushing of public toilets\\" rule. Confused reporting about these issues led to the myth that the use or importation of chewing gum is itself punishable with caning. In fact, the only penalties provided under Chapter 57 are fines and imprisonment. When a BBC reporter suggested that such draconian laws would stifle the people's creativity, Lee Kuan Yew said: \\"If you can't think because you can't chew, try a banana.\\"'' Revision U.S. President George W. Bush and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong sign a free trade agreement in the White House, 6 May 2003. White House photo by Tina Hager. In 1999, United States President Bill Clinton and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong agreed to initiate talks between the two countries for a bilateral free trade agreement (USS-FTA).Bill Clinton (2004). My Life. Knopf. . The talks later continued under the new administration of President George W. Bush. By the final phase of negotiations in early 2003, there remained two unresolved issues: the War in Iraq and chewing gum. The Chicago-based Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company enlisted the help of a Washington, D.C lobbyist and of Illinois Congressman Phil Crane, then-chairman of the United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, to get chewing gum on the agenda of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. This caused a dilemma for the Singapore Government. It recognised the health benefits of certain gums, such as a brand of sugar-free gum that contains calcium lactate to strengthen tooth enamel. Sale of this newly categorised medicinal gum was allowed, provided it was sold by a dentist or pharmacist, who must take down the names of buyers. In May 2003, the USS-FTA was signed and the ban was revised. \\"They were tough,\\" Crane said of the talks. Some found it surprising that Wrigley had fought hard on this battle, given the small size of Singapore's chewing market. But the company said it was worth it. \\"There's many examples in our history of things that may have not made short-term financial sense but was the right thing to do in a philosophical or long-term sense,\\" said Christopher Perille, Wrigley's senior director of corporate communications.

Succession rights  In 2003, aged 15, following the example of his grandmother the Duchess of Kent and his uncle Lord Nicholas Windsor, Downpatrick, who was baptised in the Church of England, chose to be confirmed in the Roman Catholic Church. He was therefore barred from the line of succession to the British throne according to the Act of Settlement 1701. As a first cousin twice removed of Queen Elizabeth II, Downpatrick is the most senior person excluded from the line of succession for being a Roman Catholic; as of May 2019, he would have been 39th in line. He remains second in the line of succession, after his father, to the Dukedom of Kent. In 2008, Downpatrick's sister Lady Marina followed his example and was confirmed in the Roman Catholic church.

It was designed by John Smedley, with later additions Spain and Cosh and Minnett and built from 1888 to 1916. It is also known as Trades Hall Building. The building was built and owned by the Trades Hall Association, the original trade union affiliates who built the hall in 1888, and is now owned by Unions NSW. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Trades Hall was conceived on 14 December 1882 when representatives of thirteen unions met at The Swan with Two Necks Hotel in George Street. This was the original meeting place for the Union Movement. It was there that the organisation that led to the building of the Sydney Trades Hall was formed. A grant of land was made for the Trades Hall site on 13 October 1885, to the trustees: Henry Copeland (Member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, MLA) of Newtown, Jacob Garrard (MLA) of Balmain, William Ferrier of Balmain (a stonemason), John Edward West of Woolloomooloo (a plumber and gasfitter), John Richard Talbot of Sydney (iron moulder), John Atkinson of Balmain (a boilermaker), Thomas Candy of Surry Hills (a draper), and Richard Mooney of Woolloomooloo (a journeyman tailor). The trustees were required to \\"hold and use or allow the said land hereby granted and the buildings to be erected thereon to be at all times hereafter maintained and used as and for a Trades Hall and Literary Institute for the use of the Artificers and Operatives of Sydney aforesaid and others under and in accordance with such Regulations as shall from time to time be made by the Governor\\". The Sydney Trades Hall is linked with the history of the union movement in New South Wales, one of the first formalised union movements in the world. Similarly, the birth of the NSW Branch of the Labor Party can be traced to Trades Hall leaders sending their own representatives to Parliament following the collapse of the Maritime and Shearers Strike early that century. The first portion of the building was designed in 1887, by architect John Smedley, one of Australia's first native born architects. Smedley won a design competition for the building, which was intended for meetings held by working men and as a place where lectures could be given and instruction in literature obtained. It also included a library and the banner room. On 28 January 1888 Lord Carrington, as State Governor (also Grand Master Freemason of the United Grand Lodge in NSW), laid the foundation stone of Sydney's Trades Hall. Due to lack of funds, it took several years for the building to be erected. Finally, the opening ceremony was performed on 26 January 1895 by the Minister for Education and the Chairman of the Land Trustees, Mr Jacob Gerrard. In his address he commented, \\"The Trades of the colony will now have a home of their own\\". According to Mr McIntyre, president of the Builders and Contractors Association, \\"every man employed had been a unionist, and had received the full rate of pay ordered by the associated trades.\\" The subsequent major additions completed in 1900, 1912 and 1916 followed closely the Victorian Italianate Style of the original building. The architects for these additions were Spain, Cosh and Minnett.Daybreak Architects, n.d.

Heritage listing  As at 10 December 2008, The Sydney Trades Hall is important as one of the first and continuing headquarters of much of the New South Wales Trade Union Movement. It is a fitting reminder of an important part of Australia's history which was to be followed by many western countries based on Australian experience. The birth of the Labour Party may be traced to Trades Hall leaders. The building's design is by one of Australia's first native born architects, John Smedley. Its composed facades and tower contribute to the Haymarket area by retaining a nineteenth century character and provide a dominant landmark. The Trades Hall was held in high esteem by the working community and this was reinforced by Mr Jacob Gerrard's address at the official opening day. The subsequent rapid growth of the trade Union Movement earlier this century saw the original building enlarged considerably to accommodate its needs. Original records of meetings and other historical events in the life of the Trade Union Movement have been collected and are kept in the original library and banner room. Sydney Trades Hall was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

He was recognised for his work in the cultivation of cinchona and for setting up a system for the inexpensive distribution of quinine throughout India through the postal system. Early life George was born in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, to Robert King and Cecilia Anderson. Robert King was a bookseller who moved to Aberdeen to partner with his brothers who were also in the book business. One brother Arthur was the founder of the Aberdeen University Press. Another brother George was an antiquarian, founder of a local liberal newspaper and a prominent writer on economic and social matters. King's parents both died from phthisis (tuberculosis), the father in November 1845 aged thirty six and the mother in 1850 at the age of forty. Orphaned at the age of ten, George was taken care of by his namesake uncle. After studying at the Aberdeen Grammar School where he was nicknamed \\"Tertius\\" to distinguish him from other \\"King\\" namesakes, a name that stuck. One of his teachers was Patrick Geddes. Although a good student, his health was poor and he was forced to leave in 1854. The family was associated with the Free church but King later favoured the Anglican church. For a while he worked in his uncle's press business but he continued to take a greater interest in natural history, an interest that had developed in his youth. He started putting together a collection in his work place, something the printer uncle despised. At the age of eighteen King decided to pursue a medical education and entered the University of Aberdeen in 1861, where he was influenced by his teachers George Dickie, Alexander Harvey and John Struthers. In 1862 King became an assistant to Alexander Dickson. This led to an interest in cryptogamic botany and he was advised by Sir W.J. Hooker to follow the path of Hooker's son (J.D. Hooker) and join the Naval Medical Service. King however was interested in India upon reading Royle and Hooker's works. The Indian Medical Service had suspended recruitment from 1860 but recruitment restarted in April 1865. King obtained an M.B. in 1865 and joined the Indian Medical Service on 2 October, carrying with him an Ipecacuanha plant from Hooker. He left for India in March and reached Calcutta on 11 April 1866. India Portrait in The Gardeners' Chronicle (1909) King was initially appointed to the General Hospital before transferring to the Medical College Hospital where he was made house surgeon. He fell ill with pneumonia and it was suggested that he transfer to a drier climate. He was posted to Agra on 4 September and was attached to the 41st Bengal Infantry. He moved to Mathura in January 1867. Bouts of illness continued and it was suggested that he should move to central India. He was posted to Guna in February 1867, taking charge of the Central India Horse. The next year he moved to Rajputana with stints at Deoli, Mount Abu and Jodhpur before moving to the Botanic Garden at Saharanpur. At the end of 1869, as his term was ending at Saharanpur, he was invited to join the Forest Department as an Assistant Conservator. In his postings in India, he worked during his leisure time on its plants, making a study of the famine plants. He also made an ornithological survey of Guna. The posting in Dehra Dun gave him more time for study. King found that the forests of the Doon were being destroyed with a system of bribery and corruption within the Forest Department. King worked to eliminate the corrupt officials. In January 1871 King moved to the Kumaon Forest Division and prepared a report on the forests of Ranikhet. He also contributed to the botanical sections of the Gazetteers. It was recommend that he be made a permanent Deputy Conservator. In 1869, the Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta, Thomas Anderson, fell ill (left for Europe and died in 1870) and in 1871, the Secretary of State for India selected King as a successor. King took up the position and was also a Professor of Botany in the Medical College of Bengal. King was faced by the destruction wrought by two cyclones in 1864 and 1867. King was also involved in matters associated with tea and cinchona cultivation. While on an official visit to the Nilgiris in July 1872, he developed symptoms of pulmonary phthisis(tuberculosis). He was treated in Coonoor before moving to Europe. He spent a year in the Riviera and returned to Calcutta to resume duties in November 1873. King restructured the Calcutta Botanical Gardens, raising the level of the ground, creating ponds and laying out footpaths and conservatories. A fireproof herbarium was also constructed based on plans from Kew. King also altered the garden design from one segregated linearly on the basis of taxonomy to one based on regions with combinations of species showing the natural plant associations. He began the journal, the Annals of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta In 1873 King was also associated with the creation of the Calcutta Zoological Garden. He was also associated with setting up a botanical garden at Darjeeling. King had earlier suggested that a post for a quinologist be created and the appointee C.H. Wood found a way to extract alkaloids and this helped produce a popular Cinchona Febrifuge. Wood returned in 1879 but his setup was worked by J.A. Gammie. King replaced the quinologist, studying the methods of the Dutch and went on furlough to England in 1885 to study Wood's continued work back there. Returning to India, King worked on a system for the distribution of quinine through the postal department. The system was fully operational in 1893. Village post offices in Bengal were able to sell small packets for a pice, the smallest coinage. He also supervised the work of botanical artists and worked with Sir Joseph Hooker to help him prepare the Flora of British India. A major work was on the Annonaceae of British India. In 1891, he was appointed the first director of the Botanical Survey of India, an institution that linked the botanical officers in the different Presidencies. King also produced a work on the orchids of the eastern Himalayas, The Orchids of the Sikkim- Himalayas (1898) in the Annals along with Robert Pantling (1857‚Äì1910) who was an assistant in the Mungpoo cinchona plantations working with James Alexander Gammie. King also wrote a series of articles Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In 1898 King was succeeded at the Calcutta Botanical Gardens by Sir David Prain (1857‚Äì1944). Personal life and last years Memorial to Sir George King, St Machar's Cathedral King married Jane Anne Nicol (1845-1898) in 1868. Jane fell ill and died on the way back to England in 1898. The loss was a blow and in the following years King lost an eye due to a ruptured vessel and he increasing fell ill. He reflected on the history of botany in India at the 69th meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1899.King, Sir George. 1899. The Early History of Indian botany. Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. pp. 904-919. He died of a seizure at San Remo on 12 February 1909. He is buried in the cemetery in San Remo but is memorialised on the grave of his wife in St Machar's Cathedral in Old Aberdeen. Botanical reference Species described by him include the climbing fig Ficus pantoniana from New Guinea and northern Australia. Honours and memorials King took an interest in the Asiatic Society of Bengal, was sometime president of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India. He also encouraged research among his friends. David Douglas Cunningham and Arthur Barclay helped him on matters of plant pathology. He received a degree of LL.D. in 1884 and was elected to the Royal Society in 1887. As a landscape gardener, he was recognised by the Royal Horticultural Society and awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour in 1901. He was awarded the Linnean Medal in 1901. For his work on making quinine and distributing it inexpensively he was made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society and given a ring of honour by Czar Alexander III. On 1 January 1890 he was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire. In 1898 he was created K.C.I.E. A memorial was built at San Remo, where he visited every winter from 1898 until his death. There is a memorial plaque to him and his wife in St Machar's Cathedral, Old Aberdeen.

The British practice of afternoon tea, where black tea is served with milk and sugar, grew popular in Hong Kong. Milk tea is similar, except with evaporated or condensed milk instead of ordinary milk.

Outside of Hong Kong it is referred to as \\"Hong Kong-style milk tea\\". It has another name, \\"silk stocking milk tea\\" which originates from the appearance of the sackcloth tea leaf filter bag. In the 1950s and 1960s, the main customers of Hong Kong style milk tea were workers and labourers, who thought that the sackcloth looked like pantyhose.Lam, C. Y. (19 May 2018). Lam, C.Y. interview conducted by Epoch Times [Video]. Retrieved from http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/18/5/19/n10408628.htm Production Hong Kong- style milk tea is made of a mix of several types of black tea (in the Western sense, often Ceylon tea), possibly pu'er tea, evaporated milk, and sugar, the last of which is added by the customers themselves unless in the case of take- away. The proportion of each tea type is treated as a commercial secret by many vendors A variation uses condensed milk instead of milk and sugar, giving the tea a richer feel. To make the tea, water and tea (about 1 to 3 teaspoons of tea a cup, depending how strong the drinker likes) are brought to a boil then simmered for about 3‚Äì6 minutes. The tea is usually put in a sackcloth bag before the water is added to the pot to filter it out or if no bag available poured through a strainer. Many people also remove the pot from the heat once it boils for about 3 minutes, then bring the pot to a boil again. This process can be repeated several times, intensifying the caffeine/flavor. The key feature of Hong Kong-style milk tea is that a sackcloth bag is used to filter the tea leaves. However any other filter/strainer may be used to filter the tea. Sackcloth bags are not completely necessary but generally preferred. The bag, reputed to make the tea smoother, gradually develops an intense brown colour as a result of prolonged tea drenching. Together with the shape of the filter, it resembles a silk stocking, giving Hong Kong-style milk tea the nickname of \\"pantyhose\\" or \\"silk stocking\\" milk tea (). This nickname is used in Hong Kong but less so in mainland China and overseas communities.CNN Go 40 Hong Kong foods we can't live without 13 July 2011. Retrieved 9 October 2011 There is some debate over the most authentic way of making milk tea, i.e. the sequence of adding each ingredient. Some have argued that milk should be added before pouring the tea, while others hold the opposite view. Though, to most people, both methods are acceptable. Some restaurants may choose to use condensed milk, where sweetness is already mixed in and cannot be changed. This creates a creamier than normal milk tea, which is also a bit thicker in viscosity. Other restaurants may use evaporated milk and allow the consumers to mix in the sugar themselves. Hot milk tea in a coffee cup accompanies a breakfast Milk tea is a popular part of many Hong Kongers' daily lives, typically served as part of afternoon tea, but also at breakfast or dinner. It enjoys nearly the same ubiquitous status that coffee holds in the West. Whilst not offered by more traditional Cantonese restaurants or dim sum teahouses, milk tea is standard fare in Hong Kong-style western restaurants and cha chaan teng, as well as Hong Kong's historic dai pai dong, with a price between HKD$12‚Äì16 (hot, one or two dollars more for cold). A cup of hot milk tea is usually either served in a ceramic cup (often referred to as a \\"coffee cup\\" ÂíñÂï°ÊùØ) or a tall cylindrical plastic glass. Criteria for quality milk tea The first criterion of a good cup of milk tea is its \\"smoothness\\" (È¶ôÊªë); in other words, how creamy and full-bodied it is. Another criterion for tasty milk tea (and also bubble tea) is some white frothy residue inside the lip of the cup after some of it has been drunk. This white froth means that the concentration of butterfat in the evaporated milk used is high enough. There is also another way for locals to distinguish high quality by identifying hints of oil on top of the drink after it has been properly brewed. This is the oil remains from the extensive process through the roasting process. The taste and texture of 'Hong Kong' style milk tea might be influenced by the milk used. For example, some Hong Kong caf√©s prefer using a filled milk variant, meaning it is not purely evaporated milk (as with most retail brands) but a combination of skimmed milk and soybean oil. Varieties Ice bath milk tea, the cup of milk tea is placed in an icy water bath so the tea can be kept cold without getting diluted by the melting ice. Today, iced milk tea is usually prepared with ice cubes. However, in the old days, when machines for producing ice cubes were not popular, the iced milk tea was made by filling the hot milk tea into a glass bottle and then cooling it in a fridge. Sometimes the milk tea were filled in Vitasoy or Coca-Cola bottles, and were sold by bottle. Today this type of \\"bottle milk tea\\" is rare in Hong Kong. Iced milk tea in cans or plastic bottles can be found in many of the convenience stores around Hong Kong such as 7-Eleven and Circle K. In the case of milk tea with ice cubes, the melting ice will dilute the content, thus affecting the taste of the drink; therefore, many people prefer the old way of preparing iced milk tea. Today, some cha chaan tengs serve ice-less iced milk tea, made by pouring hot milk tea into a plastic cup and then cooling it in a fridge. Another way is to place the cup/bottle into a cold water bath, which is called \\"ice bath milk tea\\" (). Some restaurants simply use ice cubes made of frozen milk tea. All these methods are often used as selling points. Cha jau () is milk tea prepared with condensed milk, instead of evaporated milk and sugar. Its taste is, as can be expected, sweeter than ordinary milk tea. In the old days, Cha chow was mostly drunk by older people who had \\"congestion\\" in their throats. Another saying is that drinking Hong Kong Style milk tea with added sugar will induce phlegm in the throat. As a result, a request milk of tea without evaporated milk and sugar, but adding condensed milk instead. Shortening the phrase \\"Milk Tea without evaporated milk and sugar\\" became \\"Cha Jau\\", and condensed milk is automatically added. Milk tea and coffee together is called Yuenyeung (). Yeung jau is milk tea/coffee with condensed milk. A variation on \\"silk stocking tea\\" is \\"silk stocking coffee\\".

Martin, a professor and head of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, maintains the creative class is a key driving force for economic development of post-industrial cities in the United States. Overview Florida describes the creative class as comprising 40 million workers (about 30 percent of the U.S. workforce). He breaks the class into two broad sections, derived from Standard Occupational Classification System codes: * Super-creative core: This group comprises about 12 percent of all U.S. jobs. It includes a wide range of occupations (e.g. science, engineering, education, computer programming, research), with arts, design, and media workers forming a small subset. Florida considers those belonging to this group to \\"fully engage in the creative process\\" (2002, p. 69). The Super- Creative Core is considered innovative, creating commercial products and consumer goods. The primary job function of its members is to be creative and innovative. \\"Along with problem solving, their work may entail problem finding\\" (Florida, 2002, p. 69). * Creative professionals: These professionals are the classic knowledge-based workers and include those working in healthcare, business and finance, the legal sector, and education. They \\"draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems\\" using higher degrees of education to do so (Florida, 2002). In addition to these two main groups of creative people, the usually much smaller group of Bohemians is also included in the creative class. In his 2002 study, Florida concluded that the creative class would be the leading force of growth in the economy expected to grow by over 10 million jobs in the next decade, which would in 2012 equal almost 40% of the population.  Background  The social theories advanced by Florida have sparked much debate and discussion. Florida's work proposes that a new or emergent class‚Äîor demographic segment made up of knowledge workers, intellectuals and various types of artists‚Äîis an ascendant economic force, representing either a major shift away from traditional agriculture- or industry-based economies or a general restructuring into more complex economic hierarchies. The theses developed by Florida in various publications were drawn from, among other sources, U.S. Census Bureau demographic data, focusing first on economic trends and shifts apparent in major U.S. cities, with later work expanding the focus internationally. A number of specific cities and regions (including California's Silicon Valley, Washington, DC, Baltimore, Boston's Route 128, The Triangle in North Carolina, Austin, Seattle, Bangalore, Dublin and Sweden) have come to be identified with these economic trends. In Florida's publications, the same places are also associated with large Creative Class populations. Florida argues that the creative class is socially relevant because of its members' ability to spur regional economic growth through innovation (2002). Walter Gr√ºnzweig, professor for American Studies at Technical University of Dortmund, has shown that the origin of the term ‚Äúcreative class‚Äù does not lie with Florida, but instead goes back to a passage in Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay \\"Power\\" in his collection The Conduct of Life (1860).Gr√ºnzweig, p. 91.Emerson, p. 49.  Occupations  Florida says that the creative class is a class of workers whose job is to create meaningful new forms (2002). It is composed of scientists and engineers, university professors, poets and architects, and also includes \\"people in design, education, arts, music and entertainment, whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology and/or creative content\\" (Florida, 2002, p. 8). The designs of this group are seen as broadly transferable and useful. Another sector of the Creative Class includes positions that are knowledge intensive; these usually require a high degree of formal education (Florida, 2002). Examples of workers in this sector are health professionals and business managers, who are considered part of the sub-group called Creative Professionals. Their primary job is to think and create new approaches to problems. Creativity is becoming more valued in today's global society. Employers see creativity as a channel for self-expression and job satisfaction in their employees. About 38.3 million Americans and 30 percent of the American workforce identify themselves with the creative class. This number has increased by more than 10 percent in the past 20 years. The creative class is also known for its departure from traditional workplace attire and behavior. Members of the creative class may set their own hours and dress codes in the workplace, often reverting to more relaxed, casual attire instead of business suits and ties. Creative class members may work for themselves and set their own hours, no longer sticking to the 9‚Äì5 standard. Independence is also highly regarded among the creative class and expected in the workplace (Florida, 2002).  The global economy  The Creative Class is not a class of workers among many, but a group believed to bring economic growth to countries that can attract its members. The economic benefits conferred by the Creative Class include outcomes in new ideas, high-tech industry and regional growth. Even though the Creative Class has been around for centuries, the U.S. was the first large country to have a Creative Class dealing with information technology, in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s less than five percent of the U.S. population was part of the Creative Class, a number that has risen to 26 percent. Seeing that having a strong Creative Class is vital in today's global economy, Europe is now almost equal with America's numbers for this group. Inter-city competition to attract members of the Creative Class has developed. Following an empirical study across 90 nations, Rindermann et al. (2009) argued that high-ability classes (or smart classes) are responsible for economic growth, stable democratic development, and positively valued political aspects (government effectiveness, rule of law, and liberty).  Places of high creative class populations  Florida's use of census and economic data, presented in works such as The Rise of the Creative Class (2002), Cities and the Creative Class (2004), and The Flight of the Creative Class (2007), as well as Bobos in Paradise by David Brooks (whose \\"bobos\\" roughly correspond to Florida's creative class), and NEO Power by Ross Honeywill[citation needed], has shown that cities which attract and retain creative residents prosper, while those that do not stagnate. This research has gained traction in the business community, as well as among politicians and urban planners. Florida and other Creative Class theorists have been invited to meetings of the National Conference of Mayors and numerous economic development committees, such the Denver mayor's Task Force on Creative Spaces and Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm's Cool Cities Initiative. In Cities and the Creative Class, Florida devotes several chapters to discussion of the three main prerequisites of creative cities (though there are many additional qualities which distinguish creative magnets). For a city to attract the Creative Class, he argues, it must possess \\"the three 'T's\\": Talent (a highly talented/educated/skilled population), Tolerance (a diverse community, which has a 'live and let live' ethos), and Technology (the technological infrastructure necessary to fuel an entrepreneurial culture). In Rise of the Creative Class, Florida argues that members of the Creative Class value meritocracy, diversity and individuality, and look for these characteristics when they relocate (2002). As Florida demonstrates in his books, Buffalo, New Orleans and Louisville are examples of cities which have tried to attract the Creative Class but, in comparison to cities which better exemplify the \\"three 'T's\\", have failed. Creative Class workers have sought out cities that better accommodate their cultural, creative, and technological needs, such as Chapel Hill, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Austin, Seattle, Toronto, Ontario and Portland, Oregon. Florida also notes that Lexington and Milwaukee, Wisconsin have the ingredients to be a \\"leading city in a new economy\\". The \\"Creativity Index\\" is another tool that Florida uses to describe how members of the Creative Class are attracted to a city. The Creativity Index includes four elements: \\"the Creative Class share of the workforce; innovation, measured as patents per capita; high tech industry, using the Milken Institute's widely accepted Tech Pole Index‚Ä¶; and diversity, measured by the Gay Index, a reasonable proxy for an area's openness\\" (2002, pp. 244‚Äì5). Using this index, Florida rates and ranks cities in terms of innovative high-tech centers, with San Francisco being the highest ranked (2002). Florida and others have found a strong correlation between those cities and states that provide a more tolerant atmosphere toward culturally unconventional people, such as gays, artists, and musicians (exemplified by Florida's \\"Gay Index\\" and \\"Bohemian Index\\" developed in The Rise of the Creative Class), and the numbers of Creative Class workers that live and move there (2002). Research involving the preferences and values of this new socioeconomic class has shown that where people choose to live can no longer be predicted according to conventional industrial theories (such as \\"people will go to where the jobs/factories are\\"). Creative workers are no longer bound by physical products, rather working with intellectual products. Their migration to metropolitan urban areas where creative work is available is more due to the attraction of leisure life and community rather than actual work. Although the Creative Class works towards the globalization of progressive and innovative ideas and products, they can also be considered to value local community and local autonomy. Sociologists and urban theorists have noted a gradual and broad shift of values over the past decade. Creative workers are looking for cultural, social, and technological climates in which they feel they can best \\"be themselves\\". \\"The main assumption underlying this approach is that creative workers seek creative outlets in all aspects of their lives and therefore migrate to cities that actively support their preferred lifestyles\\" (Donegan et al., 2008, p. 181). Each year Florida and the Martin Prosperity Institute release the Global Creativity Index, an international study of nations, ranking countries on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. \\"The GCI is a broad-based measure for advanced economic growth and sustainable prosperity based on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. It rates and ranks 139 nations worldwide on each of these dimensions and on our overall measure of creativity and prosperity\\" (Florida et al., 2015). The GCI takes into account the diversity of geographical locations noting their openness as the means for progressive ideas to prosper. \\"Tolerance and openness to diversity is part and parcel of the broad cultural shift toward post-materialist values... Tolerance‚Äîor, broadly speaking openness to diversity‚Äîprovides an additional source of economic advantage that works alongside technology and talent\\" (Florida, 2012, p. 233). Diversity allows these locations to attract creative individuals and therefore stimulate economic growth. The findings from the 2015 GCI measured 139 countries on their creativity and prosperity. Ranked number one on the 2015 GCI is Australia. Share of Gross National Product spent on Research and Development is constantly raising at world level. Creative activities are growing at a fast pace in most advanced countries. 60% of the products that will be sold in 2030 do not yet exist. Repetitive works are being robotized. The whole world is becoming a \\"Creational Society\\". Lifestyle The diverse and individualistic lifestyles enjoyed by the Creative Class involve active participation in a variety of experiential activities. Florida (2002) uses the term \\"Street Level Culture\\" to define this kind of stimulation. Street Level Culture may include a \\"teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians, and small galleries and bistros, where it is hard to draw the line between participant and observer, or between creativity and its creators\\" (p. 166). Members of the Creative Class enjoy a wide variety of activities (e.g., traveling, antique shopping, bike riding, and running) that highlight the collective interest in being participants and not spectators (Florida, 2002). Criticisms Numerous studies have found fault with the logic or empirical claims of Florida's Creative Class theory. This body of critical empirical research demonstrates how the Creative Class thesis, and the associated creative city policy prescriptions, in fact exacerbate social and economic inequalities in cities in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Jamie Peck argues that the Creative Class theory offers no causal mechanism and suffers from circular logic. John Montgomery writes that \\"what Florida has devised is a set of indices which simply mirror more fundamental truths about creative milieux or dynamic cities.\\" Montgomery also disagrees with the cities that Florida designates as most creative, writing that London, not Manchester and Leicester, should be one of the top in the U.K. A critique of Florida's research and theoretical framework has been developed by Matteo Pasquinelli (2006) in the context of Italian Operaismo. = Statistical indices and composition = Scholars in the disciplines of economics, geography, sociology, and related social sciences have challenged Florida's conception of the \\"creative class\\", particularly for the perceived fuzziness of the concept and the lack of analytical precision. A number of studies have found problems with Florida's statistical indices. Hoyman and Faricy, using Florida's own indices, find no statistical evidence that cities with higher proportions of Creative Class workers correlated with any type of economic growth from 1990‚Äì2004. By using metropolitan areas as the unit of analysis, the high degree of socio-spatial variation across the metropolitan region is ignored. Studies and popular accounts have questioned whether the creative class is more likely to live in the homogenous, low-density suburban periphery. Social scientists have also identified problems with the occupational composition of the creative class. Economic geographer Stefan Kratke challenges the inclusion of financial and real estate professionals within the creative class on two accounts: 1) these individuals played a decisive role as the \\"dealer class\\" in the 2007 financial crises, and therefore cannot be considered a basis for sustainable urban and regional economic growth; and 2) the financial and real estate industries (especially in headquarter cities) are economically significant regional/urban players only because they are largely \\"reliant on inflows of wealth created by productive activities in other regions.\\" Moreover, Kratke argues that the \\"political class\\" is also ill-suited to be included within creative class, as they are, in many cases, implicated in neoliberal financial deregulation and the rise in highly unstable urban and regional growth regimes evident through real estate bubbles across the United States and in other countries. In \\"Urban Development and the Politics of the Creative Class\\", Ann Markusen argues that workers qualified as being in the Creative Class have no concept of group identity, nor are they in occupations that are inherently creative. Markusen also notes that the definition of the Creative Class is based largely on educational attainment, suggesting that Florida's indices become insignificant after controlling for education. Markusen argues that Florida \\"does not seem to understand the nature of the occupational statistics he uses\\" and calls for the major occupational groups to be disaggregated. She questions the inclusion of particular occupations within these broad categories such as claim adjusters, funeral directors, tax collectors, yet argues that \\"[t]hese occupations may indeed be creative, but so too are airplane pilots, ship engineers, millwrights, and tailors ‚Äì all of whom are uncreative in Florida's tally.\\" Moreover, it is questioned whether human creativity can be conflated with education since \\"[p]eople at all levels of education exercise considerable inventiveness.\\" =Economic growth= Research shows that economic growth is experienced when the significance of scientifically/technologically and artistically creative workers is taken into account, but this macro-level conclusion can be drawn without Florida's creative class theory, which provides more of an \\"affirmation of contemporary class relations.\\" Other scholars have criticized the very basis for Florida's definition of \\"creativity\\" which many argue is conceived of narrowly and is only valued for the potential for financial and economic growth. Studies have too questioned Florida's argument that jobs and economic growth follow the creative class, and the migration patterns of the creative class have been challenged. Rather than validating Florida's causal logic that attracting the creative class will lead to economic growth, empirical research shows that successful regions pull and maintain human capital. The creative class thesis‚Äîand Richard Florida himself‚Äîhave been criticized for what appears to be a change in Florida's prognosis for America's ailing Rust Belt cities. Florida's message was so quickly and enthusiastically adopted by cities because he argued that any city had the potential to become a vibrant, creative city with the right infrastructure investments, policies, and consulting advice. A 2009 article, \\"The Ruse of the Creative Class\\", questions Florida's costly speaking engagements in struggling industrial cities in which he offered optimistic prognoses‚Äîand his more recent pronouncements that many American cities may never be saved in the wake of the Great Recession. The creative class thesis has also drawn criticisms for relying on inner city property development, gentrification, and urban labor markets reliant on low- wage service workers, particularly in the hospitality industry. Florida has called for service workers' wages to rise. =Grassroots resistance= Creative Class Struggle, a Toronto-based collective, has brought these criticisms outside academic circles, challenging Florida's Creative Class theories as well as their widespread adoption into urban policy. The group manages an online clearinghouse for information about creative city strategies and policies, publishes a newsletter and other materials, and works to engage the media and public in critical discussion. In June 2009, Creative Class Struggle and art magazine Fuse organized a public forum in Toronto to debate these issues.

The office has won more than 30 awards for house designs from the American Institute of Architects. The firm was known as Buff and Hensman when Cal Straub moved to Arizona and later Buff, Smith and Hensman when Dennis Smith bought the practice after Don Hensman's retirement. Partners The partnership, originally Buff, Straub, and Hensman, consisted of Conrad Buff III, Calvin Straub, and Donald (Don) Hensman, all of whom were American Institute of Architects (AIA) licensed architects. Conrad Buff III FAIA (August 5, 1926 - 1989) was born in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California, to the creators of children's books Mary and Conrad Buff. His father Conrad Buff II was also a painter of the American southwest. Family acquaintances included Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler and opera singer Lawrence Tibbett; redesigning the Buff II garage was one of Neutra's first architectural commissions. Buff III attended local Eagle Rocks school. He graduated from U.S.C. School of Architecture in 1952. For ten years Buff was a faculty member of USC contributing design curriculum. Conrad served in the Navy in World War II at a base in Maryland, which was where he met his wife Elizabeth (Libby), a skipper's yeoman in the WAVES; film editor Conrad Buff IV is their son. After the War, Conrad decided to enroll at USC School of Architecture, where he met Donald Hensman, who had also returned from the War. Donald C. Hensman FAIA (1924, Omaha, Nebraska - 2002) grew up in Hollywood, California. He served in the navy during World War II, as a parachute rigger in the South Pacific, and entered the USC architecture program by way of the GI Bill. It was at USC that Hensman met Conrad Buff. But prior to their collaboration with Straub, Buff and Hensman were designers of tract homes for a number of regional developers. He returned to teach architecture at his alma mater, USC from 1952 to 1963. He was eventually made assistant professor within USC's design curriculum and was chairman of the joint USC/American Institute of Architects education committee. Hensman remained active in the Pasadena architectural community until his death in 2002. Calvin C. Straub FAIA (1920‚Äì1998) was born in Macon, Georgia. He studied at Texas A&M; University and Pasadena City College before receiving his degree in architecture at the University of Southern California in 1945. After serving in the Navy, Straub lectured at USC from 1946 to 1961. Moving to Scottsdale, AZ in 1961 and joining the faculty at the College of Architecture at Arizona State University. Few architects and educators have had such a pervasive influence on architecture as Calvin C Straub.. He created an important body of work as the senior partner of Buff Straub and Hensmen, both previous students at USC. His work was widely published in Sunset Magazine and considered highly influential in shaping the vision iconography of the post-World War II contemporary southern Californian style. His and the firms work bridged the gap between the influences of early arts and crafts architects and the early California modernists, creating a uniquely regional architectural form. For this work and his educational contributions he was described in \\"Toward a simpler way of Life\\" as \\"the father of California post and beam architecture\\". His desert residence continued and extended the legacy of \\"design with climate\\" that he had begun decades again in southern California and preceded the now popular \\"green movement\\" in architecture by some 30 years. Until 1988 he held a professorship of design at Arizona State University in Tempe where his \\"world architecture\\" class attended by more than 15,000 general university students who were influenced by his contagious, jovial and animated love affair with the art of environmental design. He worked for the firm of A.B. Gallion before entering into a partnership with Conrad Buff and Donald Hensman (1956‚Äì61), and was a member of Schoneburger, Straub, Florence & Associates (1972‚Äì75). Straub also ran his own private practice in Arizona. He Received over 30 Honors and AIA awards. Apart from his work as an architect and lecturer, he also published Design Process and Communications (1978) and The Man-Made Environment: An Introduction to World Architecture and Design (1983). He retired in 1988 and died in 1998. His archives, drawings, project records, awards and project photographs many by famed Architectural photographer Julius Shulman are archived at the Arizona State University School of architecture library and archive. Partnership In 1948, while both attending the University of Southern California (USC) School of Architecture and working together designing tract and model homes (but prior to beginning their practice), Buff and Hensman were asked by the Dean of the School of Architecture to take over the teaching duties left by the death of a senior professor. This meant that both Buff and Hensman were at the same time working professionals, students and teachers, all before being licensed or graduating. Both continued to teach and be associated with USC for many years. In 1961 Calvin Straub left the practice to teach architecture at Arizona State University. Buff and Hensman continued their partnership as Buff, Hensman and Associates. Conrad Buff died in 1989 and Dennis Smith joined the partnership the same year to form Buff, Smith and Hensman, from which Hensman retired in 1998. Smith carries on in the practice, located in Pasadena. The Buff, Straub, and Hensman firm's masterwork was Case Study House #20, the Saul Bass House (Altadena, 1958). It was built of factory-produced stressed skin panels and plywood vaults. Despite thorough engineering calculations, the architects were not awarded a building permit until a sample plywood vault had been temporarily erected and loaded with weights. Its open plan introduced the concept of zoning: the owner's zone with studio office, garden, master bedroom & bath; a formal zone with living and dining rooms and entry atrium; a family zone with kitchen, family room, dining terrace, two additional bedrooms and swimming pool. Architect Calvin Straub's own post-and-beam home in Pasadena was another project that brought the practice commissions.

Associated organisms  The plant community dominated by P. flabellata is widely used by birds and mammals. Breeding colonies of southern fur seal, elephant seal, Magellanic penguin, macaroni penguin, and albatrosses are all found amongst tussac grass on South Georgia and elsewhere. The austral thrush is predominantly found in this habitat on the Falkland Islands, with tussocks being used as nesting sites.Collar (2005) pp. 677-678 The South Georgia pipit also uses the tussocks for nesting. On South Georgia, it is a principal food of the introduced reindeer, which has caused considerable environmental damage, including erosion and replacement of tussac grass by the introduced annual meadow-grass.

The physical number plates are not provided by the government, but are made by garages to the order of the car owner. A vehicle ( Tesla Model X ) in Hong Kong with license plates from Mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong Hong Kong number plates as observed in 2009 Mandatory cross-border Guangdong plate to display when a Hong Kong registered vehicle enters Guangdong Province, mainland China Overview Each vehicle must display two number plates, one at the front and one at the rear of the vehicle. The front plate has black characters on a white background, and the rear plate has black characters on a yellow background. The height of the letters and numerals are not less than 8 cm (3.1 in) and not more than 11 cm (4.3 in). The plates should comply with British Standard B.S. 145a and have permanently marked on the plate the specification number \\"B.S. AU 145a\\". Numbering system Lexus LS 600h L bearing the HKSAR emblem in place of a registration plate, the official transport of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Vehicles of the Chief Executive do not have registration plates. Instead, they have the Emblem of Hong Kong in front and at the rear. During British administration, the vehicle of the Governor bore the St Edward's Crown emblem. =Usual numbers= border- crossing plate displayed on a vehicle below a standard Hong Kong plate Most car numbers consist of a two-letter prefix followed by a number between 1 and 9999 without leading zeroes. Some car numbers do not have a letter prefix. The letters \\"I\\", \\"O\\" and \\"Q\\" are not used to avoid ambiguity. The very first numbers allocated (1‚Äì9999) have no prefixes. \\"HK\\" and \\"XX\\" were the first two prefixes allocated, then went from \\"AA\\", \\"AB\\", \\"AC\\", all the way to \\"AZ\\", then \\"BB\\", \\"BC\\", \\"BD\\", all the way to \\"BZ\\" and then \\"CA\\", \\"CB\\", \\"CC\\", and so on. However AM was reserved for Government vehicles. There was no \\"BA\\" prefix allocated at the time because the government thought that it would get mixed up with \\"AB\\". \\"BF\\" was also skipped; however, authorities changed their minds to allocate the \\"CA\\" prefix after \\"BZ\\", and in 2003, \\"BA\\" and \\"BF\\" prefixes were available for auction. The prefixes \\"FU\\", \\"FV\\" and \\"ZM\\" were also issued out of turn. \\"FU\\" and \\"FV\\" are typically issued to vehicles with primary registration abroad (Primarily in Mainland China), and \\"ZM\\" in Macau, and are used as their \\"cross-border\\" plates while in Hong Kong. Some \\"DW\\" and \\"EW\\" registration marks are also used for this purpose. Shortly prior to the handover of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, the Advanced Detachment of the People's Liberation Army entered Hong Kong. The vehicles of the Advanced Detachment were assigned a series of \\"AD\\" registrations for their Hong Kong registrations. These vehicles also displayed their Mainland Chinese registrations whilst in Hong Kong. Some prefixes are reserved and have special meanings. As of October 2020, the current allocated prefix is \\"WZ\\". After the exhaustion of two-digit prefixes \\"ZZ\\", a new scheme will be required but it has not yet been announced. =Motorcycles= Formerly, motorcycles used a different set of registration marks. Like the marks for cars, the very first numbers had no prefixes. Later, marks with a single-letter prefix were issued. For example, \\"B 281\\", \\"C 367\\". The separate issuance system of registration marks for motorcycles has been discontinued and merged with the main system. Some registered motorcycles still bear the early marks. Hence, a unique registration mark without letter prefix could be found on two different types of vehicles. =Unusual numbers= One-letter prefixes\\"A\\" prefix for ambulances of the Fire Services Department of the government *\\"F\\" prefix for fire engines and other vehicles of the Fire Services Department of the government *\\"T\\" prefix for use by the motor trade, especially on vehicles that are still unlicensed. These plates are unusual in that they are not specific to any vehicle. They are red-on-white and usually displayed in a plastic holder attached temporarily to the vehicle by rubber straps. The 'T' is followed by up to five numerals. Special prefixes\\"AM\\" is reserved for government vehicles. *\\"LC\\" is reserved for Legislative Council vehicles. *\\"ZG\\" (for Zh√π G«éng ÈßêÊ∏Ø which means \\"stationed in Hong Kong\\") is for the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong. ZG plates are not issued with the standard fonts seen on civilian plates. The font used is the same as that of Mainland Chinese plates. However, the plates are still black-on-white in the front and black-on-yellow in the rear. *\\"ZM\\" is used for vehicles registered in Macau which are permitted to enter Hong Kong via Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. *formerly \\"UC\\" was reserved for the then Urban Council. Now available to civilian vehicles. *formerly \\"RC\\" was reserved for the then Regional Council. Now available to civilian vehicles. *formerly \\"HA\\" was reserved for the Hospital Authority. Now available to civilian vehicles. Letter suffix\\"T\\" suffix for semi-trailers and have a prefix up to 5 digits. Letters-only These are specific car numbers with no numbers, simply letters only *\\"CJ\\" for the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal *\\"CS\\" for the Chief Secretary for Administration *\\"FS\\" for the Financial Secretary *\\"SJ\\" for the Secretary for Justice Other unusual numbers VV-series plate *\\"VV\\" non-exclusively for village vehicles; small vehicles on narrow paths where usual vehicles are prohibited. The numerals may have leading zeroes. They are used on Lantau Island and Lamma Island to take provisions from the wharf to the villages. VV stands for \\"village vehicle\\". They are also available to public. *The registration marks used by vehicles of British Army in Hong Kong used the same format as British military vehicles elsewhere: two numbers, then two letters, and two numbers. For example, \\"15KL44\\". =Special registration marks= A car number is a special registration mark if *it has no prefix; or *its numerals are any of the following: (1-digit numbers) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (1 is reserved for the Commissioner of Police) (two repeated digits) 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99 (three repeated digits) 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999 (four repeated digits) 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444, 5555, 6666, 7777, 8888, 9999 (multiples of 10) 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 (multiples of 100) 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 (multiples of 1000) 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678, 789 1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678, 6789 (other two digit) 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 (two double digits) 1100, 1122, 1133, 1144, 1155, 1166, 1177, 1188, 1199, 2200, 2211, 2233, 2244, 2255, 2266, 2277, 2288, 2299, 3300, 3311, 3322, 3344, 3355, 3366, 3377, 3388, 3399, 4400, 4411, 4422, 4433, 4455, 4466, 4477, 4488, 4499, 5500, 5511, 5522, 5533, 5544, 5566, 5577, 5588, 5599, 6600, 6611, 6622, 6633, 6644, 6655, 6677, 6688, 6699, 7700, 7711, 7722, 7733, 7744, 7755, 7766, 7788, 7799, 8800, 8811, 8822, 8833, 8844, 8855, 8866, 8877, 8899, 9900, 9911, 9922, 9933, 9944, 9955, 9966, 9977, 9988 (4-digit palindromes) 1001, 1221, 1331, 1441, 1551, 1661, 1771, 1881, 1991, 2002, 2112, 2332, 2442, 2552, 2662, 2772, 2882, 2992, 3003, 3113, 3223, 3443, 3553, 3663, 3773, 3883, 3993, 4004, 4114, 4224, 4334, 4554, 4664, 4774, 4884, 4994, 5005, 5115, 5225, 5335, 5445, 5665, 5775, 5885, 5995, 6006, 6116, 6226, 6336, 6446, 6556, 6776, 6886, 6996, 7007, 7117, 7227, 7337, 7447, 7557, 7667, 7887, 7997, 8008, 8118, 8228, 8338, 8448, 8558, 8668, 8778, 8998, 9009, 9119, 9229, 9339, 9449, 9559, 9669, 9779, 9889 (3-digit palindromes) 101, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212, 232, 242, 252, 262, 272, 282, 292, 303, 313, 323, 343, 353, 363, 373, 383, 393, 404, 414, 424, 434, 454, 464, 474, 484, 494, 505, 515, 525, 535, 545, 565, 575, 585, 595, 606, 616, 626, 636, 646, 656, 676, 686, 696, 707, 717, 727, 737, 747, 757, 767, 787, 797, 808, 818, 828, 838, 848, 858, 868, 878, 998, 909, 919, 929, 939, 949, 959, 969, 979, 989 (repeated two digits) 1010, 1212, 1313, 1414, 1515, 1616, 1717, 1818, 1919, 2020, 2121, 2323, 2424, 2525, 2626, 2727, 2828, 2929, 3030, 3131, 3232, 3434, 3535, 3636, 3737, 3838, 3939, 4040, 4141, 4242, 4343, 4545, 4646, 4747, 4848, 4949, 5050, 5151, 5252, 5353, 5454, 5656, 5757, 5858, 5959, 6060, 6161, 6262, 6363, 6464, 6565, 6767, 6868, 6969, 7070, 7171, 7272, 7373, 7474, 7575, 7676, 7878, 7979, 8080, 8181, 8282, 8383, 8484, 8585, 8686, 8787, 8989, 9090, 9191, 9292, 9393, 9494, 9595, 9696, 9797, 9898 Although unlisted above, some traditional lucky numbers may be reserved, especially numbers that contain 3 or 8, which are pronounced in Cantonese similarly to words that mean \\"long life\\" and \\"prosperity\\" respectively. For example, 168 is always a reserved number since its pronunciation in Cantonese means \\"Rich all-time\\". Lucky numbers are allocated only after sale by public auction which takes place from time to time. The proceeds of the auction goes to the Government Lotteries Fund to be used for charitable purposes. Auction of numbers From 1973, the Transport Department of the Hong Kong government conducts auctions to sell numbers. Currently, auctions are usually on Saturdays and sometimes on Sundays, and there are about two auctions per month. Numbers sold must be assigned to a car registered in the name of the buyer of the number within 12 months from the date of auction. The car can be an existing car of the buyer, or a car purchased from someone else after the auction, or a brand new car to be purchased after the auction. The Transport Department can advise whether a number has been allocated. =Auction of special registration marks= A special registration mark obtained in an auction is not transferable, that is to say, the number can be used only on vehicles registered under the name of the buyer. Transferring a special registration mark from one vehicle to another is permitted provided that they are both owned by the same person. Sale or transfer of vehicles bearing a special registration mark to someone else would lose that special registration mark. If the buyer is assigned the special registration mark to a vehicle, and later dies, the special registration mark cannot be transferred together with the vehicle to his heirs. Therefore, it is very important to consider in whose name one should buy a special registration mark in an auction. The use of a limited liability company as the buyer gets around the non-transferable restriction because of its perpetual succession and the ability to transfer the company shares. =Reserving numbers for auction= Except with \\"AM\\" , \\"LC\\" or \\"ZG\\" prefixes, any unallocated usual numbers may be reserved for auction, provided it has an earlier prefix in the sequence, or the current prefix, or the next immediate prefix. For example, if the current prefix is \\"LX\\", then a number with a prefix \\"AA\\", \\"AB\\", ...\\"AZ\\", \\"BA\\", ... \\"LX\\", or \\"LY\\" may be reserved for auction. Numbers having no prefix or a \\"XX\\" prefix may also be reserved for auction. It is doubtful whether numbers with the \\"ZG\\" prefix may be reserved for auction after the prefix runs to \\"ZF\\". To reserve a non-special registration mark for auction, one needs to pay a deposit of HK$1000. The minimum price for the number is also HK$1000. If the number is successfully bid for by a person other than the person who reserved the number, their deposit is refunded. If no one else bids at the auction, the number is sold to the person who reserved the number, for HK$1000. If it is a special registration mark, there is no deposit to pay, and the minimum price will be set by the Transport Department but will be higher than HK$1000. Personalised Vehicle Registration Marks Scheme Personalised vehicle registration marks scheme Th Personalised Vehicle Registration Marks Scheme was adopted since 2006 to allow creation of numbers with up to 8 characters (including letters and/or numbers). The letters \\"I\\", \\"O\\" and \\"Q\\" are banned from use in the new scheme, with the former two letters officially recognised as numbers \\"1\\" and \\"0\\" respectively. Since \\"I\\" and \\"O\\" look identical to \\"1\\" and \\"0\\" under the standard font type used on Hong Kong plates, phrases like \\"SIU SIU\\" and \\"I LOVE U\\" can be printed on the plates, although they are officially recognised as \\"S1U S1U\\" and \\"1 L0VE U\\". The numbers under this scheme are auctioned for a minimum of HK$5000. Although drivers are usually granted their choice of plate, obtaining a unique or easily recognised plate can be very competitive. For example, the registration I LOVE U was sold at a charity auction for HK$1.4 million. The first PVRMS auction was held on 16 September 2006. Owners of number 1 to 10 The plate \\"1\\" is reserved for the Commissioner of Police, while plate numbers '2' to '10' have all been sold at auction. Some of the owners are Hong Kong celebrities. The current owners of number plates 1 to 10 are: *1 : Commissioner of Police *2 : Wong Ming Wai (ÁéãÊòéÁ∂≠) *3 : Cheng Kung Sze (ÈÑ≠ÂÖ¨ÊôÇ) *4 : Cecil Chao (Ë∂ô‰∏ñÊõæ) *5 : Joseph Lau (ÂäâÈëæÈõÑ) *6 : the Hong Kong boss of Amway *7 : Heung Chik Kau (È¶ôÊ§çÁêÉ) *8 : Law Ting Pong (ÁæÖÂÆöÈÇ¶) *9 : Albert Yeung (Ê•äÂèóÊàê) *10 : Yung Wing Doi (ÂÆπÊ∞∏ÈÅì)  Diplomatic vehicles in Hong Kong  A diplomatic car with the \\"CC\\" badge. The normal registration plates are used alongside Unlike some other countries (where diplomatic cars have special registration numbers), cars operated by foreign consulates, consular staff, and various international organisations have been given \\"CC\\" (consular corps) badges, with red writing on a white background. These are oval in shape, and are much smaller than the registration plate, but are affixed to the front and back of the vehicle.

Guangzhou's status as the only port accessible to foreign traders led to the development of Cantonese cuisine having many outside influences. As Guangzhou's economy grew from trade and interaction with Britain, pastry chefs at the Western-style department stores in the city were asked to invent new pastries weekly to attract customers from competitors. The egg tart, featuring a lard-based puff pastry crust and a filling similar to steamed egg pudding (ÁáâËõã), was invented by a department store for one of these \\"Weekly Special\\" competitions. The Zhen Guang Restaurant in Guangzhou is also credited with inventing the Chinese egg tart. As Macau was a Portuguese colony, Macau-style egg tarts are a variation of the pastel de nata but they have been influenced by Guangzhou-style egg tarts. Variations =Hong Kong = Hong Kong-style egg tart Egg tarts were introduced to Hong Kong via Guangzhou in the 1940s but initially could only be found in higher-end Western-style restaurants. In the 1960s, cha chaan tengs began to serve egg tarts, popularizing the pastry with the working-class Hong Kong population. Hong Kong egg tarts are typically smaller and served in twos or threes, in contrast to the original Guangzhou egg tarts which were larger and could be served as a single item. The custard filling may be flavored with chocolate, green tea, abalone or bird's nest, and the outer shell may be made with shortcrust pastry or puff pastry. In June 2014, the technique of egg tart production was formally included in the Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of Hong Kong. =Macau= Macau-style pastel de nataIn 1989, British pharmacist Andrew Stow and his wife Margaret Wong opened Lord Stow's Bakery in Coloane, where they sold a Macau-style egg tart that attempted to recreate the pastel de nata. This variation is referred to in Chinese as po tat (). In 1999, Wong sold the recipe to KFC, which then introduced the Macau-style pastel de nata to other Asian countries including Singapore and Taiwan. In contrast to the Hong Kong-style egg tart, the Macau-style egg tart features a caramelized browned top.

Development Design work on the new rifle officially began in 1984 at the government-owned O≈õrodek Badawczo-Rozwojowy (OBR) in the city of Radom at the request of the Polish Ministry of Defense (the OBR institute had already been studying a possible 5.45mm weapon since late 1980). In 1985, the weapon‚Äôs parameters were confirmed and factory tests were conducted by the end of that year. In 1986 the first batch of prototypes was fabricated for evaluation and qualification testing. These early prototypes, initially designated wz. 1981, were modeled on the Soviet 7.62mm AKM assault rifle.Wo≈∫niak, Ryszard: Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej‚Äîtom 4 R-Z, page 135. Bellona, 2002. As the weapon was intended to be able to launch rifle grenades, a newly designed, multi- functional muzzle device and a sturdier folding shoulder stock were used (the wire stock is a copy of the wire stock used on the East German MPi-KMS-72 rifle). Additionally, the wz. 81 was equipped with a mechanically limited burst fire mode, borrowed from the AKMS wz. 1980 prototype developed in the late 1970s by OBR. By the end of 1987 the rifle was extensively overhauled and improved (among the changes made, a series of components were introduced that were meant to be interchangeable with the AK-74, including the bolt carrier, bolt, magazines and the burst fire mode was further refined). In January 1988, these product improved prototypes were again evaluated, and in 1989 the rifle was declared to have met its requirements, followed by an order for a pre- production batch, which was manufactured that same year. In 1990 the rifles were successfully evaluated and then transferred for final operational testing. In 1991 the rifle was introduced into service with the Polish Army as the 5,45 mm karabinek wz. 1988 (kbk wz. 88). The weapon‚Äôs design was authored by the team of engineers at OBR in Radom, under the guidance of B. Szpaderski. The rifle was produced exclusively with a folding wire stock by the ≈Åucznik Arms Factory in Radom. Design details The Tantal is a selective fire, gas piston operated weapon that taps expanding exhaust gases off through a port in the barrel to a gas cylinder above the barrel. The barrel is locked against its longitudinal axis by a right rotating bolt. A spring extractor is contained inside the bolt head, and a fixed ejector‚Äîinside the receiver housing. The fire control selector, with its lever located on the left side of the receiver wall, enables fully automatic fire (lever in the ‚ÄúC‚Äù-marked position), semi-automatic fire (‚ÄúP‚Äù) and 3-round burst fire mode (‚ÄúS‚Äù). The selector can be operated with the safety either engaged or disabled. The burst mode is achieved through a ratcheting device on the left side of the receiver that interacts with the trigger group on the trigger-disconnector and hammer pins.wz.88 Tantal - A Tantalean Ordeal Its location eliminates the need for an anti-pin walkout device, such as a Shepard's Crook on semi-auto AKs and extended auto sear spring on full-autos. It also has an advantage to the M16 Rifle's burst mode in that releasing the trigger in the middle of a burst (1-2 shot fired instead of full 3) causes the ratchet to reset making the next 3-round burst a new, full one instead of a continuation of the previous. The PA md. 86 achieves burst fire in a very similar manor with ratcheting device on trigger-disconnector and hammer pins though simply has a standard AK selector switch with an additional notch for burst and still retains the Rate Reducer, which the Tantal lacks.Value of Romanian 3 round burst Kit? The weapon is secured against misfires through a manually operated safety (whose lever, as in the AKM is located on the right side of the receiver), that disables the trigger bar and limits the movement of the bolt carrier. Sliding the safety selector to the top position (marked with a ‚ÄúZ‚Äù symbol) secures the weapon, lowering the lever down (‚ÄúO‚Äù setting) disables the safety. The Tantal feeds from a double-column curved box magazine, made from a synthetic bakelite material or stamped metal, with a 30-round cartridge capacity. The cold hammer forged barrel has a chrome-plated bore with 4 right-hand grooves at a 200 mm twist rate. It is equipped with a multifunction muzzle brake that can be used to launch rifle grenades. The Tantal features a metal wire side-folding stock (folds to the right side), ended with a profiled shoulder pad. The rifle can also use a fixed wooden or synthetic buttstock designed for AKM or AK-74 rifles. Both the upper and lower handguard and pistol grip are fabricated from bakelite, although a limited number of Tantal-specific black polymer handguards and pistol grips have also been produced. Most handguards designed for use with the wz. 1996 Beryl assault rifle may also be installed on the Tantal. The rifle has mechanically adjustable iron sights that consist of a notch on a sliding tangent and forward post. The rear sight‚Äôs drop arm has a range scale engraved with settings from 1 to 10 (corresponding to firing ranges from 100 to 1,000 m, graduated every 100 m) and a fixed setting ‚ÄúS‚Äù that is the equivalent to setting ‚Äú4‚Äù on the range scale. Additionally, the sight assembly is fitted with a radium gas illuminated vial that enables use in low light and near dark conditions. Equipment supplied with the Tantal includes: three spare magazines, a 6H4 type bayonet with scabbard, bipod, four 15-round stripper clips (they enable rapid magazine charging), a stripper clip guide, cleaning kit, sling, magazine pouch and a lubricant bottle. The weapon's muzzle brake can also be replaced with a blank firing adaptor for use with blanks during training exercises. The wz. 88 rifle fires the intermediate 5.45√ó39mm round with either standard, tracer or training cartridges, all produced locally by Zak≈Çady Metalowe \\"Mesko\\" in the town of Skar≈ºysko- Kamienna. Variants The Tantal was used to develop the Onyks carbine, the karabinek-granatnik wz. 1974 rifle/grenade launcher combination and a ‚Äúnight‚Äù variant of the wz. 1988, equipped with a receiver side-rail used to mount an NSP-3 night sight (or Polish PCS-5 night sight).

Landi Kotal is a tourist destination. It was the terminus railway station of Khyber Pass Railway. A tourist train, the Khyber train safari was run on this railway. However, the train was closed down in 2006 due to washing away of the railway track and bridges by flood. Landi Kotal is the main shopping centre for the Shalmani, Shinwari, Afridi, and Mulagori tribes of Khyber Agency.

It runs roughly west‚Äìeast through Ireland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, and Russia. Its length is but it is not continuous; at three points, a sea crossing is required. Roll-on/roll-off ferries make the crossings from Dublin to Liverpool and from Stockholm to Tallinn. No publicly accessible ferries traverse the North Sea from Kingston-upon-Hull to Esbjerg (as of 2019), but a ferry for commercial drivers leaves Immingham for Esbjerg on most days.  Route  = Ireland = The initial section of the E20 from Shannon Airport to Dublin via Limerick is approximately 228 km long and is only partially signed, along the M7/N7. The section from Shannon Airport to east of Limerick is mainly dual carriageway, with a short section of motorway as part of the Limerick Southern Ring Road. The Shannon Tunnel, opened on 16 July 2010, completed the bypass of Limerick. The section from Limerick to Naas is motorway (M7), and the final section from Naas to Dublin is dual carriageway (N7). A ferry must be used from Dublin to Liverpool. = United Kingdom = E20 follows the A5080 from Liverpool to Huyton, the M62 from Huyton to South Cave, and the A63 from South Cave to Kingston upon Hull. The route length across the UK is in total but is not signposted. There are no ferries between Kingston upon Hull and Esbjerg. Alternative ferries were once available from Immingham, which is from Kingston upon Hull, and Harwich, which is from Kingston upon Hull. There are no longer any passenger routes operating between the UK and Scandinavia. The closest alternative is to take the Eurotunnel Shuttle from Cheriton (Folkestone) to Calais, or take a ferry from Harwich to Hook of Holland. Both of these routes would require a detour of around 900 miles (940 miles to Esbjerg, as this route would require you to drive along the E20 to reach Esbjerg). = Denmark = In Denmark, E20 is a motorway from Esbjerg to the √òresund Bridge. The length of the Danish part is . It passes first along Jutland from Esbjerg to Kolding, then crosses the Little Belt Bridge onto Funen. E20 crosses the entirety of Funen, passing around 2km from Odense. Then, at Nyborg, E20 crosses the Great Belt Fixed Link onto Zealand. E20 follows the Vestmotorvejen until K√∏ge, where it goes north to Copenhagen. In Copenhagen, E20 passes south of the city, crossing onto Kastrup where it meets the Copenhagen Airport. The √òresund Bridge begins as a tunnel on Kastrup. Between K√∏ge and Copenhagen, the road has three E-road numbers (E47 and E55). The Great Belt Bridge and √òresund Bridge are both tolled, charging over ‚Ç¨30 each. The road crosses the border between Denmark and Sweden on the √òresund Bridge. = Sweden = In Sweden, E20 is a motorway from the √ñresund Bridge in Malm√∂ to N√§√§s 30 km east of Gothenburg, a long motorway. Furthermore, it is a motorway most of the route from Vretstorp (20 km (12 mi) west of √ñrebro) to Stockholm. The Swedish part of E20 is long. Its extent is shared with E6 along a long stretch, with E18 along and with E4 along . The part through Stockholm has very heavy traffic, including the most heavily trafficked road in Scandinavia, Essingeleden (160 000 vehicles/day). There is often congestion on this stretch. A new tunnel for route E20, \\"Norra l√§nken\\", was built north of the city center and opened 30 November 2014. The planned F√∂rbifart Stockholm bypass will divert traffic from Essingeleden. Between Stockholm and Tallinn a car ferry departs daily, taking 15 hours. The port in Stockholm is located at Lilla V√§rtan, about 4 km northeast of the central core of the city. = Estonia = In Estonia, E20 follows the route of national main road nr. 1 (Tallinn‚ÄìNarva). In Tallinn to relieve traffic a bridge has been built on the intersection of the E263 and the E20. The E20 across Estonia is partially an unsigned expressway (speed limit 110 km/h in summer), for 80.7 km east of Tallinn to Aaspere along with a section near Haljala (km 87 - 90.5) and a section between Kohtla-J√§rve and J√µhvi (km 155.9‚Äì163.2). The remainder being single carriageway. The distance from Tallinn to the Russian border at the Narva River is 218 km. = Russia = In Russia, the route takes the Narva Highway (also listed in the Russian road numbering system as the A180 route, formerly known as the M11 route) running from Ivangorod to Saint Petersburg as a dual-lane highway. The distance from Ivangorod to Saint Petersburg is 142 km. The border control facilities at the Estonia-Russia crossing are equipped and being operated for a limited amount of traffic on both sides of the border. The border crossing requires a reservation - despite this, waiting lines still can extend for many hours and even days.

The river's springs are located just northwest of the border between Laconia and Arcadia, at Skortsinos. The river is also fed by underwater springs at Pellana and by tributaries coursing down from Mt. Taygetos and Mt. Parnon, which flank the Eurotas valley to the west and east, respectively. The river is long,Greece in Figures January - March 2018, p. 12 flowing in a north-south direction and emptying into the Laconian Gulf. Etymology The classical Eurotas was changed to Iri in the Middle Ages and only changed back to Eurotas in recent times. Eurotas, however, is not the most ancient name of the river. It does not appear in the works of Homer, which purport to recount the stories and geography of Mycenaean Greece. In that legendary time, the Dorians are not known to have been present in the Eurotas Valley. At some time prior to being called Eurotas, the river was the Bomycas and the Himeras. One etymology derives the word Eur≈çtas from the ancient Greek eur≈çs (Œµ·ΩêœÅœéœÇ), \\"mold\\".. The adjective, eur≈çeis, \\"moldy,\\" is genuinely ancient, used as an epithet of Hades in Homer. It is, however, in the Ionic dialect. Geography =Physical= Sources The source of the Eurotas River is a surface spring called Piges Evrota (Œ†Œ∑Œ≥Œ≠œÇ ŒïœÖœÅœéœÑŒ±, \\"Eurotas Springs\\") located near the village of Skortsinos, Arcadia, by the side of the road ascending from Kyparissi. The spring is an outlet of an aquifer located in the adjacent limestone ridge at a locale called Kephalari. The ridge, a karst, is not part of the Taygetus Massif, but, like the other mountains of Arcadia, is a nappe raised by the compressional forces on the Hellenic Plate by the subduction of Africa. The spring is also called Logaras Spring. Logaras Spring supplies an anciently constructed catchment basin about the size of a pond, sometimes called a lake, which exits both to irrigation channels and to the Alpheios stream (not to be confused with the Alpheios river in the northwestern Peloponnese). The flow is copious except in times of drought. A recent study measured the outflow through the catchment exit every 15 days for 540 days in 2006-2007. It recorded a maximum of 1748 cubic m per hour and a minimum of 310.5 cubic m per hour. From the catchment at an altitude of part of the water flows into the Alpheios stream, which enters the upper Eurotas. The Laconian Alpheios stream is unconnected with the Alpheios river in Arcadia. The identity of their names comes from an ancient geologic misunderstanding that the Eurotas and the Apheios were connected underground, which deceived even Pausanias, one of the best ancient geographers. He believed they had the same source but that the outflow stream disappeared into a chasm only to emerge at different locations as different streams.Description of Greece, 8.44.3-8. In the most exaggerated form of the myth, the Alpheios continues under the Mediterranean to Sicily or elsewhere. Main stream Today, the river is hydromorphologically far from its natural state. The main problem is anthropogenic abstraction of water, by many methods, from the shallow aquifer through which it flows. The valley contains about 7000 wells. Water is directly removed by irrigation ditches, weirs, and pumping stations. Consequently, the river is intermittent; large sections are typically dry of surface water, even though water still flows in the aquifers. Flash flooding is a problem. Through flood control, the riverbed has been widened in places and straightened, and the vegetation has been removed from its sides.. The lower river runs between dikes in a long, straight course. Tributaries Most of the numerous tributaries of the Eurotas are right-bank, feeding the shallow aquifer. They are, however, intermittent and ephemeral.. The major ones have cut deep ravines into the Taygetus Massif. The few left-bank tributaries, receiving waters from the deep aquifer, are more substantial, but still intermittent. The classical Oineus was changed to Kelefina in the Middle Ages and not restored to its ancient name until recent times. The current Magoulitsa was formerly the Trypiotiko. Delta The rich alluvial soil through which the final 10 km of the Eurotas flows was not there in antiquity. The Eurotas has aggraded the innermost bay of the gulf. The old coastline can be approximated by a line on the periphery of the plain of Elos marking the border within which prehistoric archaeological sites are not found. The line on the west follows the Skala- Gytheion road to Skala, the Skala-Molaoi road to Vlachiotis, southeast along the edge of the rising terrain to Asteri and south from there to the coast. Due to changes in sea level, some land on the flanks of the gulf has been drowned. The current communities of Elos, Leimonas and Agioi Taxiarches have been constructed on aggraded land. As Pausanias mentions that Elos was a port city, the current Elos cannot be identified with it. Skala, on the other hand, means \\"place of embarkation.\\" The location of the ancient port, however, is not yet known for certain. =Political= Legendary pre-Hellenic tribe In Greek legend, the human ancestor of all the peoples that inhabited the Eurotas Valley was Lelex, eponymous king of the Leleges, one of the peoples of the eastern Aegean whom the classical writers saw as autochthonous; that is, indigenous and pre-Hellenic. His son or grandson was Eurotas, the last of the line. The latter had a daughter, Sparta, but no sons. An outsider married her, Lacedaemon. Although he named the state Sparta after her, his name is now known to have most likely been the name of the Mycenaean state. Mycenaean, or late Bronze Age Greece is generally conceded to be Achaean Greek on the evidence of the Linear B and Hittite documents. If any Dorians were present they were not in any capacity overtly recorded by the surviving administrative records; however, most of the records have not survived, so in reality we do not know. Hypothetically, if the Leleges really were in the Eurotas valley, the time of their ascendancy would have been before Mycenaean times. Until the late 20th century, evidence in the valley of earlier occupation seemed to be lacking. Beginning in 1968 the University of Cambridge began a survey by underwater archaeology of a drowned town between Pounta on the mainland and Elafonisos island on the eastern side of the Laconian Gulf. The town extended over the entire drowned isthmus from 60 rock- cut tombs on the Pounta shore (a beach) to the remains of walls on Pavlopetri island off Elafonisos. A subsequent survey in 2009 discovered even earlier parts of the town and recovered additional pottery. A chronological study was done on \\"442 ceramic items, an iron nail and an obsidian chip.\\" More research on the site is planned. The town was apparently continuously occupied from the late Neolithic to Byzantine times when it was drowned, perhaps by an earthquake. Neolithic ceramics were only 3% of the 444 items. The town was mainly Early Bronze Age, which had 40%. The early Helladic pottery is \\"standard ... some showing close links with the Cyclades, western Crete and the northeastern Aegean.\\" The \\"15% Middle Bronze Age\\" is represented by middle Helladic and middle Minoan. This archaeological scenario is not incompatible with the Aegean distribution of the Leleges, although it is not possible to say who the early and middle Bronze Age inhabitants were. The late Bronze Age had 25% of the items. Classical and Byzantine items were minimal, indicating a probable near abandonment of the city at the end of the late Bronze Age. Mycenaean Lacedaemon Archaeology has provided a more complete story for the Mycenaean period. On the left bank of the Eurotas, across from Sparta, is a ridge on which sits a temple called the Menelaon. In the 20th century a survey by the British School of Archaeology revealed that the entire ridge, located in the municipal unit of Therapnes, ancient Therapnƒì, had been covered by a walled Mycenaean town, dated to the late Bronze Age by the late Helladic (LH3) pottery with some middle Helladic (MH) pottery in \\"pockets in the bedrock.\\" The archaeologists analyzing the site recognized a building Period I, dated between LH2B‚ÄìLH3A1, the latter being brought to and end about 1425 BCE by a severe earthquake. Remains of a mansion with Minoan pottery date from Period I. During Period IA, the hill settlement was rebuilt. The structures included kilns for smelting bronze. In Period II, dated to LH3A1, a villa-type structure was built of a terrace formed from previous building material further down to the south. It was probably two-story, megaron-type, with \\"less substantial walls\\" but \\"a massive foundation for what could be a defense tower.\\" It was connected to the top by stairs. Period III, LH3A2‚ÄìLH3B2, begins with 150 years of apparent abandonment and then a limited reconstruction of a one-story structure on the terrace. The staircase was blocked. The entire ridge was intensely occupied leaving a profusion of Mycenaean pottery. The villa was burned at the end of LH3B2, leaving a destruction level. Two persons buried in the associated rubble appear to have died violently. Occupation of the hill went on through the Greek Dark Age, reduced to the Menelaon shrine in the Archaic and Classical Periods. Dedications to Menelaus and Helen are found in its vicinity starting the Archaic period. The excavators concluded that in the \\"later 15th century\\" (BCE) the ridge was \\"the principal settlement site in Laconia.\\" The shrine and its dedications identify it as the site of Homeric Sparta, capital of a ruling couple believed by the population of the Archaic Period to have been Menelaos and Helen. Classical Sparta archeological Sparti, modern town, Taygetus mountains The classical-era city of Sparta was built on the west bank of the Eurotas about halfway down the valley. The Spartans made little use of the left bank of the river: Only one permanent bridge has been found that crossed to it, at Therapne just south of the city. The main traffic was southward to the port of Gytheio, which was the most convenient outlet. All others involved a trek over mountains. Post- classical Laconia Modern Laconia is a political subdivision of Greece covering the Eurotas Valley, the massifs on either side, the two headlands, and the enclosed Laconian Gulf with its coastal islands. Its seat is the city of Sparta, as in ancient times, at a site which dominated and still dominates the valley from its central position. However, the rich-soil plain is entirely divided into villages that practice agriculture, viticulture, and arboriculture intensely. The main roads from Sparta form a branching network leading out radially from the city to connect other cities and towns in the valley. A web of secondary roads fills in the spaces between the main roads. Ecology In modern times, much of the river water is used for irrigation, with the result that the Eurotas is almost dry during the summer months. The waters of the Eurotas are used to irrigate mainly citrus crops, for which Laconia is famous. The plain of Elos near the river's mouth is particularly fertile farmland. In the winter months, the Eurotas is prone to flooding. On 24 November 2005 heavy floods damaged buildings and stranded automobiles in the streets, and harmed orchards, including the valley's famous orange and olive groves. The floods affected many villages along the valley as well as the town of Gytheio; of land was ruined. Currently the nitrate waste from fertilizers is polluting the river, aggravated by diminished flow because of the irrigation demands on it. Geology =Geomorphology= The Eurotas River occupies the floor of a rift valley, or graben, created by extensional forces acting over the Hellenic Plate in a northeast-southwest direction. The corresponding fault-block mountains are the Taygetus Massif on the west and the Parnon Massif on the east ‚Äì both limestone ridges derived from a former sea bed. On the east side of Taygetus is the Sparta Fault, a normal fault, which strikes in a zig-zag path along the foot of the massif and dips toward the interior of the valley. The river is on the western side. From it the scarps of the footwall of the Sparta Fault are visible at the base of Tayegetus. Taygetus is transected by deep ravines through which tributaries flow into the Eurotas. At the foot of the massif is a zone of scree. To the east of that alluvial fans from Taygetus cover half the valley, making it asymmetrical. On that account it is often called the Evrotas Furrow. The Eurotas flows over a flood plain and also through a shallow aquifer of sand and gravel 10‚Äì60 m deep, graded with the deep end downstream. The gradient of the aquifer is a steep 1‚Äì3%. The highest hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity are near the junction of the Xerias and the Eurotas south of Sparti. To the east are older and finer sediments of alternating clay and marl beds, some of which are impermeable. Under the entire valley is a deep aquifer in the limestone floor, containing water permeating downward through the horsts. The Eurotas collects runoff and drains the deep aquifer on the east bank but loses water to the shallow aquifer on the west bank. =Recent geologic history= Analysis of bore holes in the valley indicate that in the Pliocene it was a lake. In classical times, according to the ancient authors, it was swampy, but the cultivatable land exposed was very fertile. Then, as now, it was used mainly for fruit trees, especially olive. Geologic analysis done in the 20th century hypothesized that the Eurotas Valley in the Late Pliocene was an inland sea over the lower and middle valley several hundred m deep at the current mouth of the river. The fault-block geology had developed earlier. During the Pleistocene the sea level dropped exposing a flat floor. Continued slippage along the Sparta Fault dropped the middle Eurotas valley further forcing the river to cut its way through the 100‚Äì250 m hills dividing the lower from the middle valley, creating Eurotas Ravine.

Characterized by its bizarre characters and occurrences, use of maimed and dwarf performers, and heavy doses of Christian symbolism and Eastern philosophy, the film is about the eponymous character ‚Äì a violent, black-clad gunfighter ‚Äì and his quest for enlightenment. Plot El Topo is traveling through a desert on horseback with his naked young son, Hijo. They come across a town whose inhabitants have been slaughtered, and El Topo hunts down and kills the perpetrators and their leader, a fat balding Colonel. El Topo abandons his son to the monks of the settlement's mission and rides off with a woman whom the Colonel had kept as a slave. El Topo names the woman Mara and some days later sexually assaults her. She convinces him to defeat four great gun masters to become the greatest gunman in the land and to earn her love. Each gun master represents a particular religion or philosophy, and El Topo learns from each of them before instigating a duel. El Topo is victorious each time, not through superior skill but through trickery or luck. After the first duel, a black-clad woman with a male voice finds the couple and guides them to the remaining gun masters. As he kills each master, El Topo has increasing doubts about his mission, but Mara persuades him to continue. After the final gun master outsmarts El Topo by killing himself before El Topo is able to kill him, El Topo becomes ridden with guilt, destroys his own gun and revisits the places where he killed the masters, finding their graves swarming with bees. The unnamed woman confronts El Topo and shoots him several times in the manner of stigmata. Mara then rides off with the woman, while El Topo collapses and is carried away by a group of dwarfs and mutants. El Topo awakens many years later in a cave to find that the tribe of deformed outcasts have taken care of him and come to regard him as a God-like figure while he has been asleep and meditating on the gun masters' \\"four lessons\\". The outcasts dwell in a system of caves which have been blocked in ‚Äî the only exit is out of their reach due to their deformities. When El Topo awakens, he is \\"born again\\" and decides to help the outcasts escape. He is able to reach the exit and, together with a dwarf girl who becomes his lover, performs for the depraved cultists of the neighboring town to raise money for dynamite to assist in digging a tunnel on one side of the mountain where the outcasts have effectively been kept imprisoned. Hijo, now a young monk, arrives in the town to be the new priest, but is disgusted by the perverted form of religion the cultists practice ‚Äì notably symbolized by the frequent display of a basic line drawing of the Eye of Providence ‚Äì and their violent preoccupation with guns, from their church \\"ritual\\" through to the film's bloody climax. Despite El Topo's great change in appearance, Hijo recognizes him and intends to kill him on the spot, but agrees to wait until he has succeeded in freeing the outcasts. Now wearing his father's black gunfighter clothes, Hijo grows impatient at the time the project is taking, and begins to work alongside El Topo to hasten the moment when he will kill him. At the point when Hijo is ready to give up on finishing the tunnel, El Topo breaks through into the cave. The tunnel has been completed, but Hijo finds that he cannot bring himself to kill his father. The outcasts come streaming out, but as they enter the town, they are shot down by the cultists. El Topo helplessly witnesses the community being slaughtered and is shot himself. Powering through his wounds, he massacres the town, then takes an oil lamp and immolates himself. His lover gives birth at the same time, and she and his son make a grave for his remains. This becomes a beehive like the gun masters' graves. El Topo's son rides off with his father's lover and child on horseback.

There was no emotional relationship > between us, because I had put a clause in all the women's contracts stating > that they would not make love with the director. We had never talked to each > other. I knew nothing about her. We went to the desert with two other > people: the photographer and a technician. No one else. I said, 'I'm not > going to rehearse. There will be only one take because it will be impossible > to repeat. Roll the cameras only when I signal you to [...] And I really... > I really... I really raped her. And she screamed.\\" He went on to state, \\"Then she told me that she had been raped before. You see, for me the character is frigid until El Topo rapes her. And she has an orgasm. That's why I show a stone phallus in that scene . . . which spouts water. She has an orgasm. She accepts the male sex. And that's what happened to Mara in reality. She really had that problem. Fantastic scene. A very, very strong scene.\\" In 2019, Jodorowsky addressed his earlier comments, clarifying that it was part of a publicity stunt: \\"They were words, not facts, Surrealist publicity in order to enter the world of cinema from a position of obscurity [...] I acknowledge that this statement is problematic in that it presents fictional violence against a woman as a tool for exposure, and now, fifty years later, I regret that this is being read as truth.\\"  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, El Topo holds an approval rating of 78%, based on 41 reviews, and an average rating of 7.07/10. Its consensus reads, \\"By turns intoxicating and confounding, El Topo contains the creative multitudes that made writer-director Alejandro Jodorowsky such a singular talent.\\" El Topo was selected as the Mexican entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 44th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The visuals were the main point of contention amongst the film's critics, who debated if the sequences and montage were meaningful or merely exploitative. Concerning the symbolism within the film, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"They're all there, in a movie that is all guts (quite literally) but that has no body to give the guts particular shape or function.\\" Canby found the film to be a con. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune commented on how the visuals were perceived within the framework of drug culture. Siskel's review states, \\"Under the influence, El Topo becomes a violent, would-be erotic freakshow, and that, I suppose, can be very heavy. For others, it is enough to make one yawn.\\" Other critics, however, remain more enthusiastic about the film. For example, Roger Ebert includes El Topo in his Great Movies series. Peter Schjeldahl, writing for The New York Times, described the film as \\"a very strange masterpiece\\". He says, \\"On first blush it might seem no more than a violent surreal fantasy, a work of fabulous but probably deranged imagination. Surreal and crazy it may be, but it is also (one realizes the second time through) as fully considered and ordered as fine clockwork.\\" Influence Noteworthy figures said to be fans of the film include directors David Lynch, Nicolas Winding Refn and Samuel Fuller; video game writer and director Suda51; actors Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper; comedians The Mighty Boosh and Patton Oswalt; and performers Bob Dylan, Roger Waters, Marilyn Manson, Frank Ocean, Jarvis Cocker, Peter Gabriel, George Harrison, Lucia Lee, and John Lennon.Havis, Allan (2008), Cult Films: Taboo and Transgression, University Press of America, Inc., page 59 Gabriel has claimed Banks, T.; Collins, P.; Gabriel, P.; Hackett, S.; Rutherford, M. (2007), Genesis: Chapter & Verse, St. Martin's Griffin, page 157 that this movie was an inspiration for the classic Genesis concept album, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, while collaborator Jared Eckman described the film as a failed experiment. John Barham re-recorded the score for release on Apple Records at the request of John Lennon. Suda51 cited El Topo as a key inspiration for his game No More Heroes. Gore Verbinski cited it as an influence on Rango. Release There was no original intention to show El Topo in Mexico, where it was filmed and produced. Ben Barenholtz, an owner of the Elgin Theater in New York, saw a private screening of El Topo at the Museum of Modern Art. Barenholtz recalled that despite several audience members walking out, he was fascinated by El Topo. On a failing attempt to purchase the American rights to the film, Barenholtz convinced the producer to have the film shown at midnight at The Elgin. Barenholtz chose the late showings of 1 am on Friday and at midnight during the week to give audiences a sense of \\"self-discovery\\". The film premiered on 18 December 1970 and ran continuously seven days a week until the end of June 1971. The film was distributed across the United States through ABKCO Films, owned by Allen Klein, manager of The Beatles. The film was shown late at night like it was at The Elgin. It has been argued that without support from people like John Lennon and Allen Klein, the film would not have found a sizeable audience. Home video For many years the film could only be seen at midnight screenings in arthouses and via partially censored Japanese laserdiscs and bootleg videos. Its official DVD release was on 1 May 2007. Its first Blu-ray release was on 26 April 2011. Sequel Since at least the early 1990s, Jodorowsky has been attempting to make a sequel to El Topo. In 1996, a teaser poster was released,The Sons Of El Topo but, apparently, no shooting was actually done. The original working-title, The Sons of El Topo (Los hijos del Topo), was changed (sometime between 1996 and 2002) to Abelca√≠n.Alejandro Jodorowsky Gets Funding for Dream Project 'Abel Cain', by Ethan Anderton 27 October 2009, FirstShowing.net A 2002 article in The Guardian stated that Marilyn Manson was attached to star in the film, but that Jodorowsky was having great difficulty raising money for the project. In an interview for The Guardian in November 2009, Jodorowsky stated that his next rumoured project, a \\"metaphysical western\\" entitled King Shot, is \\"not happening\\" and instead he is to begin work on Son of El Topo, in collaboration with \\"some Russian producers\\". In 2016 the sequel was released in comic book form under the name Sons of El Topo.

FunctionsTo promote and undertake scientific industrial research *To boost industrial efficiency and development *To provide technology transfer and consultancy services *To develop Malaysian standards and to promote standardization and quality assurance for greater competitiveness *To enhance public and industrial welfare, health and safety Historical background In 1964, the Government of Malaysia directed the Minister of Commerce and Industry to make a study of the establishment of a national standards organization. This is in response to the urgent necessity of adopting the principles of standardization in light of Malaysia's accelerating industrial development. As a result, the Standards Institution of Malaysia (SIM) was initially established as a Government department under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in early 1966. In October 1966, the Standards Act No: 76, 1966 was passed in Parliament making SIM the national standards body. SIM was governed by the Standards Council. The Standards Act provides the Standards Council with independent authority for the declaration of standards and the issuance of certification mark licences. In 1974, the National Action Council decided that SIM be merged with the National Institute for Scientific and Industrial Research (NISIR) to form the Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM). As a result of this decision, SIRIM was established as a statutory body under the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment by the SIRIM (Incorporation) Act, 1975 which came into effect on 15 September 1975. With this merger, SIRIM is better equipped to expand its scope of operations in line with the rapid advancement of industrialization in Malaysia. In view of rapidly changing market needs as a result of the accelerating national industrialization and globalization of markets, there was a need to amend the SIRIM (Incorporation) Act 1975. This will provide necessary flexibility for SIRIM to respond to these changes. The Amendments to the SIRIM (Incorporation) Act, approved by Parliament, came into effect on 24 July 1993. The Amendments allow SIRIM to undertake commercial operations through the formation of joint-venture or wholly owned subsidiaries. Under this Amendment, the 24-member SIRIM Council was replaced by a 13-member SIRIM of which six were from the public sector and seven from the private sector. The new SIRIM Board structure enables greater accountability and efficiency, and further strengthen the linkages between SIRIM and the industry. One of SIRIM Berhad Subsidiary, SIRIM Standards Technology (Calibration & Measurement) On 1 September 1996, SIRIM was corporatised to be known as SIRIM Berhad.

Retrieved June 03, 2009, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online:http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/500159/retting It is used in the production of fibre from plant materials such as flax and hemp stalks and coir from coconut husks.The Mishnah (ed.

Baba Metsia 6:1 (p. 357); \\"[If a man hired labourers]... to take his flax out of steep, or any matter that will not suffer delay, etc.\\" The sense here is to the retting process. Water retting The most widely practiced method of retting, water retting, is performed by submerging bundles of stalks in water. The water, penetrating to the central stalk portion, swells the inner cells, bursting the outermost layer, thus increasing absorption of both moisture and decay-producing bacteria. Retting time must be carefully judged; under-retting makes separation difficult, and over-retting weakens the fibre. In double retting, a gentle process producing excellent fibre, the stalks are removed from the water before retting is completed, dried for several months, then retted again. Natural water retting employs stagnant or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, bogs, and slow streams and rivers. The stalk bundles are weighted down, usually with stones or wood, for about 8 to 14 days, depending upon water temperature and mineral content. Tank retting, by contrast, employs vats usually made of concrete, requires about four to six days, and is feasible in any season. In the first six to eight hours, called the leaching period, much of the dirt and colouring matter is removed by the water, which is usually changed to assure clean fibre. Waste retting water, which requires treatment to reduce harmful toxic elements before its release, is rich in plant minerals, such as nitrates, and can be used as liquid fertilizer. Dew retting Dew retting of flax in France. This is a common method in areas with limited water resources. It is most effective in climates with heavy night time dews and warm daytime temperatures. The harvested plant stalks are spread evenly in grassy fields, where the combined action of bacteria, sun, air, and dew produces fermentation, dissolving much of the stem material surrounding the fibre bundles. Within two to three weeks, depending upon climatic conditions, the fibre can be separated. Dew-retted fibre is generally darker in color and of poorer quality than water-retted fibre.  After retting  The retted stalks, called straw, are dried in open air or by mechanical means, and are frequently stored for a short period to allow \\"curing\\" to occur, facilitating fibre removal. Final separation of the fibre is accomplished by a breaking process in which the brittle woody portion of the straw is broken, either by hand or by passing through rollers, followed by the scutching operation, which removes the broken woody pieces (shives) by beating or scraping. Some machines combine breaking and scutching operations. Waste material from the first scutching, consisting of shives and short fibres, is usually treated a second time. The short fibre or tow thus obtained is frequently used in paper manufacture, and the shives may serve as fuel to heat the retting water or may be made into wallboard and to make rope.

The second valley is the Su River, which was along the north edge of Zhongtiao Mountain; and it was forming another triangular basin. The Fen River valley offered different routes of communication in Wei River valley, that both routes were open to the either side of the Yellow River.Li F. (2006).

NY: Cambridge university press. https://books.google.com/books?id=d_qOvs0WjPcC&dq;=fen+river&source;=gbs_navlinks_s =Modern= Modern cities on or near the Fen from north to south are: Taiyuan, Linfen, Houma, Hejin. Fenyang, although named after the river, is actually some 20-plus km to the west of it. As with any river that flows through a city, the Fen River added extra charm to the city of Taiyuan. The construction of dams upstream, however, reduced the once-abundant flow of the river to a mere trickle, and the river bed went dry. From 1949, Chinese government built the reservoirs such as Fen River, Wenyu River, Hui River, and several other reservoirs on the tributaries of the Fen River, which ensured Taiyuan city and other cities‚Äô industrial water, and enlarged Taiyuan basin and Linfen basin's irrigation.Killgore, W, M. (2011). World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2010: Challenges of Change.

Today, due to the influence of the water conservancy facilities, the water logging is almost inexistence, huge areas of saline-alkali soil are reformed. =Surrounding Introduction= A view of the Fen River Park in central Taiyuan as of 2011. Fen River on a historical map (double click) In the 1990s, the municipal government of Taiyuan built artificial and removable structures across the river at different locations to create reservoirs of water for landscaping purposes. The surface area of these reservoirs amounts to 1.7 million square meters and, along with newly created vegetation of 1.3 million square meters on the banks, forms the 6-kilometer long Fen River Park. The vegetation consist of 183 species trees, shrubs and other green plants. The No. 1 Fen River reservoir, built in 1960, is the biggest artificial reservoir in Shanxi province; it is also the scenic spot in the province. The length from south to north is 15 kilometers, the width is 5 kilometers, the total area is 32 square kilometers, and the capacity of reservoir is 720 million cubic meters. In 2000, the No. 2 Fen River Reservoir was built about 50 kilometers downstream the No. 1 Fen River Reservoir. The pollution of Fen River reservoir has become a serious problem.Yu, Y., Yu, Z., Zhao, J,. (2011). Computer Science for Environmental Engineering and Ecolnformatics. KM: international Association for Scientific and High Technology.https://books.google.com/books?id=Dkw99Cmf05wC&dq;=fen+river+park&source;=gbs_navlinks_s Because of the rise of population and the development of economy, the industrial, domestic, and other kinds of pollution have been on the rise. Great quantities of sewage are indiscriminately discharged into the riverbed downstream of the No. 1 and 2 reservoirs. However, the government is trying to fix the problem.

He also took an interest in geology and archaeology. He founded what is now the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany at Lucknow in 1946. His major contributions were in the study of the fossil plants of India and in plant evolution. He was also involved in the establishment of Indian science education and served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences, India and as an Honorary President of the International Botanical Congress, Stockholm. Formative years Birbal Sahni was born in Bhera, Shahpur District, in today's Pakistani Punjab, on 14 November 1891. He was the third child of Ishwar Devi and the pioneer Indian meteorologist and scientist Lala Ruchi Ram Sahni who lived in Lahore. The family came from Dera Ismail Khan and they frequently made visits to Bhera which was close to the Salt Range and Khewra's geology may have interested Birbal at a young age. Birbal was also influenced into science by his grandfather who owned a banking business at Dera Ismail Khan and conducted amateur research in chemistry. Ruchi Ram was a professor of chemistry at Lahore and was also a social activist with an interest in the emancipation of women. Ruchi Ram had studied at Manchester and worked with Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr. Every summer, Ruchi Ram would take his sons on long treks in the Himalayas, visiting Pathankot, Rohtang, Narkanda, Chini Pass, Amarnath, Machoi Glacier and Jozila Pass between 1907 and 1911. Ruchi Ram was involved in the non-co-operation movement since the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as well as the Brahmo Samaj movement. The proximity of their house to Bradlaugh Hall made their home a centre of political activity and house guests included Motilal Nehru, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Sarojini Naidu, and Madan Mohan Malaviya.Gupta (1978): pp. 3-8 Birbal Sahni received his early education in India at the Mission and Central Model School Lahore, Government College University, Lahore (where his father worked, receiving a B.Sc. in 1911) and Punjab University. The family library included books in science, literary classics and he learnt botany under Shiv Ram Kashyap (1882-1934), the \\"father of Indian bryology\\" and travelled with Kashyap to Chamba, Leh, Baltal, Uri, Poonch and Gulmarg between 1920 and 1923. He followed his brothers to England and graduated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1914. He later studied under Albert Charles Seward, and was awarded the D.Sc. degree of the University of London in 1919.Gupta (1978): pp.12-13 Career During his stint in England, Sahni joined Professor Seward to work on a Revision of Indian Gondwana plants (1920, Palaeontologica Indica). In 1919 he briefly worked in Munich with the German plant morphologist Karl Ritter von Goebel. In 1920 he married Savitri Suri, daughter of Sunder Das Suri an Inspector of Schools in Punjab. Savitri took an interest in his work and was a constant companion. Sahni returned to India and served as Professor of Botany at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi and Punjab University for about a year. He was appointed the first Professor and Head of the Botany Department of the Lucknow University in 1921, a position he retained until his death.Gupta (1978):20. The University of Cambridge awarded him the degree of Sc. D. in 1929. In 1932 Palaeontologica Indica included his account of the Bennettitalean plant that he named Williamsonia sewardi, and another description of a new type of petrified wood, Homoxylon, bearing resemblance to the wood of a living homoxylous angiosperm, but from the Jurassic age. During the following years he not only continued his investigations but collected around him a group of devoted students from all parts of the country and built up a reputation for the University which soon became the first Center for botanical and palaeobotanical investigations in India. Sahni maintained close relations with researchers around the globe, being a friend of Chester A. Arnold, noted American paleobotanist who later served his year in residence from 1958‚Äì1959 at the institute. He was a founder of The Paleobotanical Society which established the Institute of Palaeobotany on 10 September 1946 which initially functioned in the Botany Department of Lucknow University but later moved to its present premises at 53 University Road, Lucknow in 1949. On 3 April 1949 the Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the new building of the Institute. A week later, on 10 April 1949, Sahni succumbed to a heart attack.Gupta (1978):1-3. Contributions  Sahni worked on living plants species including Nephrolepsis, Niphobolus, Taxus, Psilotum, Tmesipteris and Acmopyle examining evolutionary trends and geographical distributions. His ability to apply theory to observations and make hypotheses based on observations were especially influential on his students. When examining wood remains from Harappa, he noted that they were of conifers and inferred that the people there must have had trade links with people in mountains where conifers could grow.Gupta (1978):24. He recorded foreign pollen in the ovules of living Ginkgo biloba and noted in the New Phytologist (1915), the problem with assuming that fossil pollen in ovules belonged to a single species. Sahni was among the first to suggest a separate order, the Taxales, within the conifers to contain the genera Taxus, Torreya and Cephalotaxus.Gupta (1978):34. Another major contribution was in the studies on the morphology of the Zygopteridaceae.Gupta (1978):37. Sahni identified Torreyites, a close relative of Torreya, which extended the range of the Taxales into Gondwanaland. He also described Glossopteris in detail and identified differences between the flora of India and Australia with that of China and Sumatra. He also studied the fossil plants of the Deccan Intertrappean beds. He suggested that the lower Narmada area around Nagpur and Chhindwara was coastal on the basis of fossils that showed a similarity to estuarine palms of the genus Nipa.Gupta (1978):42-48. Based on the ecology of plants and the altitude of the fossil finds, he also attempted to estimate rates of uplift of the Himalayas. Birbal Sahni's work influenced his younger brother M.R. Sahni and his nephew Ashok Sahni to take up a career in paleontology. Other interests Sahni was interested in music and could play the sitar and the violin. He was also interested in clay-modelling and in playing chess and tennis. At Oxford he used to play tennis for the Indian majlis. Other interests included geology, photography, archaeology and numismatics. In 1936 he examined some coins and moulds dating to 100 BC from a dig in Khokra Kot and wrote on the possible methods involved in the casting of the coins. The collection is now at the National Museum at New Delhi.Gupta (1978):27-29. He was much liked by his nieces and nephews who called him tamashewala uncle for entertaining them with a monkey-hand-puppet named Gippy.Gupta (1978):10-11, 13-16.

Rosenbach attended Washington State University and was selected in the first round of the 1989 NFL supplemental draft. Rosenbach became a coach after his retirement from the NFL, and he was hired in 1999 by NAIA school St. Ambrose University to be its quarterbacks coach. He has since gone on to work at other schools, including spending four years at his alma mater as its quarterbacks coach. Early years Born in Everett, Washington, Rosenbach's father Lynn was a high school and college football coach, and the family lived in a number of locations. While Lynn was an assistant coach for three seasons at the University of Montana in Missoula, Timm attended Hellgate High School for two years. Lynn was hired by the athletic department at Washington State University in 1983, and the family moved that summer to Pullman; Rosenbach attended Pullman High School for two years and graduated in 1985. Although a quarterback as a sophomore at Hellgate, he was a halfback during his first season in Pullman, then returned to quarterback for the Greyhounds as a senior. He was also nationally ranked in the javelin throw. College career After high school, Rosenbach played college football in Pullman for the hometown Washington State Cougars. He redshirted in 1985 and played three seasons, 1986 through 1988. Rosenbach led the nation in passing efficiency his junior year in 1988 under head coach Dennis Erickson. Following Erickson's departure after two seasons for Miami in early 1989, Rosenbach skipped his fifth-year senior season on the Palouse to enter the NFL supplemental draft. He finished seventh in the 1988 Heisman Trophy voting. He is a 2005 graduate of Washington State University, which has produced several other NFL quarterbacks, including Jack Thompson, Mark Rypien, Drew Bledsoe, Ryan Leaf, Jason Gesser, Alex Brink, Jeff Tuel, Luke Falk, Gardner Minshew and Anthony Gordon. Professional career Rosenbach was selected with the second pick of the 1989 NFL Supplemental Draft by the Phoenix Cardinals.

He threw for 3,098 yards, 16 touchdowns, 17 interceptions, with a 54.2 completion percentage. Rosenbach started one year for the team before injuries prematurely ended his career. He attempted a comeback with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL and the New Orleans Saints of the NFL, but failed. Upon his return to the NFL, he signed with the New Orleans Saints, but had to miss the season because of a ruptured disc in his back. He also missed the 1991 season with the Cardinals because of a knee injury suffered in training camp. Coaching career Rosenbach was the quarterbacks coach at Washington State University from 2003 to 2007 under head coach Bill Doba. In February 2012, he was hired as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Montana, under head coach Robin Pflugrad, who was replaced by Mick Delaney prior to the start of the season.

It was named in honour of the explorer Matthew Flinders. The catchment is sparsely populated and mostly undeveloped. The Flinders rises on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range in North West Queensland and flows generally north-west through the Gulf Country, across a large, flat clay pan, before entering the Gulf of Carpentaria. Course and features The River rises in the Burra Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, north-east of Hughenden and flows in a westerly direction past Hughenden, Richmond and Julia Creek, then north-west to the Gulf of Carpentaria west of . The catchment is bordered to the south by the Selwyn Range. At in length, it is the eighth-longest river in Australia. The catchment covers . The primary land use in the catchment is grazing and other agriculture, the catchment covers 1.5% of the continent. A total of 36 tributaries flow into the Flinders, the principal ones being the Cloncurry, Saxby and the Corella rivers. Another major tributary is Porcupine Creek, which has carved out a dramatic gorge located in the Porcupine Gorge National Park. There are two dams on the river - the Flinders River Dam and Corella Dam. Other smaller tributaries include: Range Creek, Morepork Creek, Oxley Creek, Canterbury Creek, Dutton River, Back Valley Creek, L-Tree Creek, Gorman Creek, Hazlewood Creek, Nonda Creek, Eurimpy Creek, Yambore Creek, Bynoe River and Armstrong Creek. The river flows through one permanent waterhole, Flagstone waterhole. Several towns are located within the catchment including: McKinlay, Burke and Wills Junction, Hughenden, Richmond, Julia Creek and Cloncurry. The river has a mean annual discharge of . The maximum flow recorded is . The riverbed is composed of silt with clay and sand, sand and gravel, and gravel with cobble. A large, flat clay pan is located in the area where the Flinders, Gregory and Leichhardt Rivers enter the Gulf. The mouth of the river lies in the Gulf Plains Important Bird Area.BirdLife International (2011) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Gulf Plains. Downloaded from on 01/07/2011 In 2015, the population living within the catchment was 6,600. =Flora= Vegetation along the river in the upper catchment includes riparian woodlands composed of paperbarks including; Melaleuca argentea, Melaleuca bracteata and Melaleuca fluviatilis and sub-dominant eucalypts including River Red Gum, Coolabah, with minor Bauhinia. Other species found include the wattle. Infestations of weeds such as Prickly acacia, Noogoora burr, Rubber vine and Chonky apple are also found. The understorey is dominated by a closed cover of riparian grasses including native couch on the sandy loams adjacent the stream channels. History Edward Jukes Greig - Arrival of Burke & Wills at Flinders River, 1862 The traditional owners of the area are the Kalkadoon, Mitakoodi, Kukatj, Guthaarn, Mayi-Yapi, Mayi-Kulan, Mayi-Thakurti, Ngawun, Wanamara, Mbara, Yirandali and Gugu-Badhun peoples, who have inhabited the area for thousands of years. Jirandali (also known as Yirandali, Warungu, and Yirandhali) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North-West Queensland, particularly the Hughenden area. The language region includes the local government area of the Shire of Flinders, including Dutton River, Flinders River, Mount Sturgeon, Caledonia, Richmond, Corfield, Winton, Torrens, Tower Hill, Landsborough Creek, Lammermoor, Hughenden, and Tangorin. Wanamarra (also known as Maykulan and Wunumura) is an Australian Aboriginal language in North West Queensland. The language region includes areas within the Shire of McKinlay, Shire of Cloncurry and Shire of Richmond, including the Flinders River area, and the towns of Kynuna and Richmond. Dalleburra (also known as Dalebura, Dal- leyburra, Yirandali) is a language of North-West Queensland, particularly Lammermoor Station via Hughenden. The Dalleburra language region includes the local government boundaries of the Flinders Shire Council. The Flinders River was named in 1841 by Captain Wickham and Lieutenant John Lort Stokes of , in honour of the explorer Matthew Flinders. Stokes charted and surveyed the estuary of the Flinders and Albert rivers, and named many other features in the area, including Disaster Inlet, Morning Inlet and the Van Diemen River. Robert O'Hara Burke, William John Wills and Charles Gray reached the river delta in 1861, completing the goal of their expedition to cross the continent from south to north. Gray died on the journey back to Cooper Creek, and both Burke and Wills died after reaching the creek to find their depot abandoned. The first pastoralist to stock country along the Flinders was James Gibson who established Prairie Station in 1861. In 1864 more cattle stations were established by Gibson including Millungera and Taldora Stations. Massive flooding occurred along the river in July 1870. One station lost over 4,000 sheep and roads were cut. In 1917 even larger floods were recorded, with Hughenden inundated several people drowned. More heavy flooding occurred in 1955, 1960, 1974, 1991 and 2000. In 2003, licences to take water from the river were first released when a pastoralist, Corbett Tritton, applied for an irrigation licence. He successfully grew crops like sorghum and cotton on his cattle station and soon other graziers were interested. A moratorium on the issuing of licences followed, but was lifted in 2013. Heavy rainfall in Queensland in early 2019 resulted in major flooding along the Flinders, considered the worst in half a century.

He is the head football coach at Louisiana State University (LSU), a position he has held since midway through the 2016 season. Orgeron previously served as the head football coach at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) from 2005 to 2007 and was the interim head coach at the University of Southern California (USC) in 2013. He led the 2019 LSU Tigers football team to a national championship, beating Clemson in the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship. Orgeron played college football as a defensive lineman at LSU and Northwestern State University. Early years and playing career Born to Edward \\"Ba Ba\\" Orgeron Sr. (d. 2011) and Cornelia \\"Co Co\\" Orgeron on July 27, 1961, Ed and his brother Steve grew up in Larose, a town on the Bayou Lafourche in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. He is of Cajun descent. Orgeron attended South Lafourche High School in Galliano, Louisiana with future Michigan Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and Atlanta Falcons quarterback Bobby Hebert. Orgeron and Hebert played on the school's Class 4A state championship team in 1977. Orgeron signed to play football at Louisiana State University, but left the program after his first year to transfer to Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana. Coaching career =Early coaching years= Orgeron began coaching in 1984 as a graduate assistant at Northwestern State and the following year coached at McNeese State in Lake Charles, Louisiana. He then served two years as an assistant strength coach under Ken Hatfield at the University of Arkansas. In 1988, he began his tenure with the University of Miami, under then-head coach Jimmy Johnson and his successor, Dennis Erickson. He was their defensive line coach for four of those years, in which he coached eight All-Americans (including NFL first-round draft choices Cortez Kennedy, Russell Maryland and Warren Sapp). While he was with the Hurricanes, the program won two national championships (in 1989 and 1991), and he recruited a young Dwayne Johnson (later known as \\"The Rock\\" in his professional wrestling and film careers) as a defensive lineman.Dan Friedell, How good was The Rock at football?, ESPN The Magazine, December 12, 2012, accessed October 2, 2013. Starting in 1991, a series of personal problems began to surface for Orgeron: a local woman filed a restraining order against Orgeron, accusing him of repeatedly attacking her. In July 1992, Orgeron was arrested for his part in a bar fight in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Orgeron acknowledged he had been intoxicated that night and had grown angry when not allowed back inside to retrieve his credit card.Randy Mell, After UM, Orgeron Turned Life Around, Sun-Sentinel, December 31, 2004, accessed September 29, 2013. In October 1992, Orgeron took a leave of absence from the University of Miami coaching staff for personal reasons; the departure turned out to be a permanent one, however, and he was replaced by assistant coach Randy Shannon.Randy Mell, Defensive Line Coach Gets Leave Of Absence, Sun-Sentinel, October 27, 1992, accessed September 29, 2013. Taking a respite from coaching, Orgeron worked on his personal life: the permanent injunction against him was eventually rescinded, and the felony second-degree battery charges he faced were dropped. He stayed with his parents in Larose, crediting his father for helping him get his life in order.Bud Poliquin, Poliquin: Ed Orgeron, the former Syracuse football aide, will long admire his old boss, Paul Pasqualoni, The Post-Standard, September 15, 2011, accessed September 29, 2013. Orgeron returned to coaching in 1994, but as a volunteer linebackers coach at Nicholls State University. The following year, he moved from the south to the northeastern U.S., accepting a job with head coach Paul Pasqualoni's staff at Syracuse University, where he coached the defensive line for three years.The Sun Herald Orgeron credited Pasqualoni for giving him a second chance at major-college coaching (after his prior personal issues had damaged his 'hireability'), and helping him develop as a coach on and off the field. =USC (first stint)= In 1998, Orgeron was hired by offensive guru Paul Hackett, the newly hired head coach of USC (the University of Southern California), to coach the Trojans defensive line. After Hackett's 2000 firing, Orgeron was one of a handful of coaches retained by Hackett's replacement, Pete Carroll, a defensive specialist. The two had met during a high school football game when Carroll was still only a candidate for the head coach position, and connected over their shared passion for recruiting.David Wharton, USC's Ed Orgeron is a rah-rah recruiter, Los Angeles Times, February 1, 2011, accessed September 29, 2013. During the Carroll years, USC enjoyed much success, including two (Associated Press) National Championships. Orgeron took on the added responsibility of Recruiting Coordinator in 2001, and was named assistant head coach in 2003. Orgeron won National Recruiter of the Year honors in 2004, the same year he was hired by Ole Miss to replace head coach David Cutcliffe. =Ole Miss= Ole Miss in 2007 Upon arriving at Ole Miss, Orgeron attempted to bring USC's passing game coordinator, Lane Kiffin, with him as the new offensive coordinator, but Kiffin opted to stay with the Trojans.Gene Wojciechowski, USC coaching hire gets complicated, ESPN.com, November 13, 2013, accessed November 19, 2013. Entering the 2005 season, Orgeron had hoped to bring a USC-style offense to the Southeastern Conference (SEC), but found limited success. The University of Mississippi's offense finished the season ranked 111th out of 117 Division I-A schools, in total offense; 115th in scoring; and, 116th in rushing. Orgeron's defensive experience, along with returning linebacker Patrick Willis, helped the Rebel defense in 2005, but as a result of the offensive woes, the 2005 team struggled and finished the season with a record of three wins and eight losses‚Äîthe Rebels' worst record since 1987. In response to the results of his first season, Orgeron fired offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone, replacing him with former University of Miami offensive coordinator Dan Werner. Also, Orgeron hired Art Kehoe, the longtime offensive line coach at the University of Miami; both assistants had just been fired by the University of Miami. In 2006, Ole Miss finished the season ranked No. 108 in scoring offense, No. 111 in total offense, and No. 112 in passing offense. Orgeron's second recruiting class in February 2006 was successful, acquiring the written pledges of a national Top 15 signing class. He followed that with the 32nd ranked recruiting class in February 2007. At Ole Miss, Orgeron recorded only two wins against teams with winning records (the 2005 and 2007 Memphis teams, which both finished at 7‚Äì5)‚Äîthe fewest among active SEC coaches at the time. Until the 2007 season, he enjoyed the public support of The University of Mississippi's chancellor Robert Khayat and other administrators with oversight of the football program, including Athletic Director Pete Boone. In a November 2006 article in The Clarion-Ledger, Khayat said of Orgeron and the poor win/loss record since he was hired (7‚Äì14, at the time of the interview), \\"I think Coach Orgeron inherited a very difficult situation....I am 100 percent behind him, and I think that people ought to understand that he has a big challenge.\\" In 2007, Ole Miss finished the season 0‚Äì8 against fellow SEC teams, and 3‚Äì9 overall. It was the program's first winless (conference) season since 1982. On November 24, 2007, after Ole Miss blew a 14-point fourth- quarter lead to in-state rival Mississippi State in the season finale, Orgeron was fired. He was replaced by former University of Arkansas head coach Houston Nutt (who had resigned from the Arkansas program three days after Orgeron's firing). =New Orleans Saints and Tennessee= On January 23, 2008, it was announced that Orgeron had been hired as the new defensive line coach of the National Football League's New Orleans Saints.http://www.sunherald.com/news/breaking_news/story/319627.html On December 31, 2008, Orgeron accepted a position with the University of Tennessee under its new head coach: former USC assistant-coach colleague Lane Kiffin. He worked as associate head coach, recruiting coordinator, and defensive line coach. =USC (second stint)= USC in 2010 Orgeron returned to USC's assistant coaching staff on January 12, 2010, after Kiffin resigned from the University of Tennessee without notice to accept the USC head coach position vacated by Pete Carroll (who had returned to head coaching in the NFL). Orgeron was one of the highest paid assistant coaches in the Pac-12 Conference, with an annual salary of $650,000. It was announced on September 29, 2013‚Äîafter Lane Kiffin's firing‚Äîthat Orgeron would be the interim head coach of the Trojans for the rest of the 2013 season, until athletic director Pat Haden found a permanent replacement. After his experience at Ole Miss, Orgeron decided to approach his second stint as a head coach differently. Instead of resuming the intense aggressiveness he had used as a defensive line and head coach, he used a different approach this time. Orgeron applied behavioral techniques he had used on his own teenage children, in an effort to approach his USC players \\"like my sons\\".Dan Wolken, , USA Today, November 7, 2013, accessed November 19, 2013. After receiving much praise for their upset win at home over highly ranked Stanford, the Trojans suffered a humiliating 35‚Äì14 defeat to cross-town-rivals UCLA‚Äîfor the second year in a row‚Äîon November 30, 2013. This greatly threatened Orgeron's chances of winning the permanent head coach position. The Trojans were 6‚Äì2 under Orgeron, finishing the regular season with a 9‚Äì4 record. On December 2, 2013, ESPN reported that another former USC assistant coach under Pete Carroll‚ÄîWashington head coach Steve Sarkisian‚Äîhad accepted USC's offer to become the next Trojans head coach. After Orgeron was passed over for the job, he resigned. =LSU= Orgeron as LSU head coach On January 14, 2015, Orgeron was hired as the defensive line coach at Louisiana State University (LSU).Kleinpeter, Jim. LSU adding Ed Orgeron to football coaching staff. nola.com. January 14, 2015. Retrieved September 25, 2016. On September 25, 2016, after LSU head coach Les Miles was fired following a loss to Auburn, Orgeron was named the team's interim head coach. Orgeron stated that he was going to \\"flip the script\\". He promoted tight ends coach Steve Ensminger to offensive coordinator and brought back Pete Jenkins to take over as defensive line coach. Orgeron also decided to shorten practices and spend more time in the film room in order to keep players fresh. In addition, he brought the \\"theme of daily practices\\" he modeled from coach Pete Carroll during Orgeron's first stint as an assistant at USC. These practice days have descriptive nicknames like Tell the Truth Monday, Competition Tuesday, Turnover Wednesday, No Repeat Thursday, and Focus Friday.Dellenger, Ross. Sources: Coach Les Miles, offensive coordinator Cam Cameron out at LSU; Ed Orgeron to be interim coach. The Advocate. September 25, 2016. Retrieved September 25, 2016. Under Orgeron's watch, LSU finished out the season with a 6‚Äì2 record. On November 26, 2016, LSU removed the \\"interim\\" tag from Orgeron's title and formally named him as its 32nd full- time head coach. The beginning of the 2017 season saw Orgeron hire Matt Canada to be the offensive coordinator. Canada was known for an offensive playbook that was heavily based on setting skilled positions in motion prior to the snap, thus using jet sweeps often. The season began with LSU ranked in the top 15, but early losses to Mississippi State and Troy quickly found LSU unranked. However, the team went 7‚Äì2 in their remaining games, finishing the year with a 9‚Äì4 record. The 2018 season began with a season opening upset of 8th-ranked Miami, followed by another upset of 7th-ranked Auburn. These victories helped LSU rise to 5th in the CFP rankings, but a loss to 25th-ranked Florida sent LSU tumbling back to 13th. In response, the Tigers pulled off a shocking upset of No. 2 Georgia followed by avenging the previous year's loss to Mississippi State. The victories over Georgia and Mississippi State propelled LSU to being ranked No. 3 by the CFP going into a game against top-ranked Alabama. The LSU offense that had seemed to turn around after Steve Ensminger took over the duties of offensive coordinator was unable to score against Alabama's defense. After the loss to Alabama, LSU was able to defeat Arkansas and Rice before falling to Texas A&M; in a 7-overtime game. With a 9‚Äì3 record, LSU was invited to the Fiesta Bowl to play the University of Central Florida, who had not lost a game in the previous two seasons. On New Years Day 2019, LSU gave UCF their first loss since 2016. LSU finished the 2018 season with a record of 10‚Äì3 and were ranked sixth in the nation by the AP poll and seventh by the Coaches poll. LSU was not predicted to have a good season in 2018, and some, including respected SEC commentator Paul Finebaum, believed it would be Orgeron's last. However, the successful season earned Orgeron a contract extension through the 2022 season. Orgeron during a post game interview with ESPN's Tom Rinaldi immediately after winning the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship After opening with a home win versus Georgia Southern, Orgeron's 2019 team recorded a statement road win over Texas in week two and proceeded to go undefeated through the regular season, including a 46‚Äì41 victory over Alabama at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa. A win over Arkansas in the penultimate game of the regular season clinched the SEC West division title and secured a berth in the 2019 SEC Championship Game against Georgia. This was their first appearance in the SEC Championship Game since 2011. The traditionally defensive-minded Tigers averaged over 48 points per game, led by quarterback Joe Burrow and Baton Rouge-native running back Clyde Edwards- Helaire. Burrow set new LSU and SEC single-season records for passing yards with 4,366; his 44 touchdown passes set a new LSU record and tied the SEC mark. Orgeron's Tigers defeated the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game to win their first SEC title since 2011. On Sunday, December 8, 2019, they were named the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff. They met the Big 12 Conference champion Oklahoma Sooners in the semifinals in the Peach Bowl, defeating them by a score of 63‚Äì28. Following the regular season, Orgeron was named the winner of the 2019 AP College Football Coach of the Year Award and Home Depot Coach of the Year Award. On January 13, 2020, Orgeron won his first national championship as a head coach with a win over the unbeaten defending national champion Clemson Tigers, 42‚Äì25, finishing the season 15‚Äì0. Orgeron and the LSU Tigers won the national title in their home state at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. In media Orgeron appears as himself in the 2009 film The Blind Side as Mississippi's head coach, recruiting Michael Oher. In 2005, Orgeron had won an intense recruiting battle for Oher. Director John Lee Hancock contacted Orgeron about playing himself, despite having been fired by Ole Miss prior to the filming of the movie; Orgeron agreed and impressed the filmmaker with his enthusiasm. In 2006, Bruce Feldman, then a senior writer at ESPN The Magazine, was allowed in-depth access to the Ole Miss program for a book about the recruiting process at a big-time college football program. The result was 2007's Meat Market: Inside the Smash-Mouth World of College Football Recruiting, a book filled with anecdotes about Orgeron, which The New York Times described as \\"one of the most insightful books ever written about college football.\\"Pete Thamel, Book Review: Meat Market, The New York Times, November 6, 2007, accessed September 29, 2013. He is also a recurring guest on the podcast Pardon My Take. Personal life Orgeron is known for his strong, gravelly, Cajun-accented voice, and intensity while coaching. In 2006, during his time at Ole Miss, he was parodied in an internet video titled \\"Colonel Reb is Cryin'\\".Glenn Guilbeau, Ole Miss coach shows his sense of humor, Shreveport Times, November 16, 2006, accessed September 29, 2013. Orgeron was previously married to Colleen Orgeron. He met his second wife, Kelly, at the 1996 Liberty Bowl, and the couple have three boys. Upon returning to USC in 2010, Orgeron lived in a hotel across the street from the campus while his wife and children made their home in Louisiana. On February 26, 2020, Orgeron and Kelly Orgeron filed for divorce. Orgeron's fourth cousin, Joseph Orgeron, was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in July 2020.https://www.wdsu.com/article/joe- orgeron-wins-54th-district-seat-formerly-held-by-reggie-bagala-who-died-of- covid-19/33285587 Head coaching record References External links LSU profile * USC profile 1961 births Living people American football defensive linemen Arkansas Razorbacks football coaches LSU Tigers football coaches LSU Tigers football players McNeese State Cowboys football coaches Miami Hurricanes football coaches New Orleans Saints coaches Nicholls Colonels football coaches Northwestern State Demons football coaches Northwestern State Demons football players Ole Miss Rebels football coaches Syracuse Orange football coaches Tennessee Volunteers football coaches USC Trojans football coaches People from Lafourche Parish, Louisiana Coaches of American football from Louisiana Players of American football from Louisiana Cajun sportspeople ","title":"Ed Orgeron"},{"id":"1844282","text":"Brian Werner is burning a bible, Party.San 2017 Live Drummer Eugene Ryabchenko, Party.San 2017 Vital Remains is an American death metal band from Providence, Rhode Island, United States, formed in 1988.According to an interview with former bassist/vocalist Joe Lewis, Vital Remains started in 1988 as a \\"blackened death metal band\\" and stated that the band formed \\"when Tony and Jeff got into a fight with some other musicians at a local metal gig and it turned out that the guys they were going to fight were Paul Flynn and his friends.. and instead of beating each other to a pulp they decided to create a band together as Vital Remains.. and the rest is history!\\" History =Formation and early years= Guitarist Paul Flynn formed Vital Remains in 1988. Vital Remains' first line-up included Paul Flynn on lead guitar, Butch Machado on rhythm guitar, vocalist Mike Flynn, bassist Tom Supkow and drummer Chris Dupont. Mike Flynn is credited with coining the band's name. Paul soon revamped the band with musicians that fit his vision, and added Tony Lazaro and vocalist Jeff Gruslin to the line-up. Lazaro and Flynn shared the song writing duties, and released a pair of demos (1989's Reduced to Ashes and 1990's Excruciating Pain). The band secured a contract with French label Thrash Records, and released the single \\"The Black Mass\\" in 1991. Shortly after the release, the band signed to Peaceville's subsidiary label, Deaf Records. Vital Remains released Let Us Pray in 1992, as well as Into Cold Darkness in 1995. However, the band requested contract dissolution with Deaf Records, citing poor distribution, and a lack of promotion. In 1996, Dave Suzuki joined the band, initially playing drums. Suzuki eventually contributed guitar work, as the band worked on their next album. In mid 1997, Vital Remains signed a two-album deal with Osmose Records. Paul Flynn left the band, citing family obligations. The band released Forever Underground in 1997. Chris Ross from Cape Cod joined the band as the vocalist and Metal Maniacs said \\"that no band on the planet put on a headbanging show of satanic fury than Vital Remains.\\" The band released Dawn of the Apocalypse in 2000, which featured vocalist Thorn. The album debuted a new, heavier style. Thorn quit the band in 1999. =Glen Benton era= In 2003, Glen Benton, vocalist/bassist of Deicide joined Vital Remains as a session vocalist for Vital Remains' fifth album Dechristianize. The album received critical acclaim, and the band toured in-between Deicide's touring schedule. The band followed up with Icons of Evil in 2007, which also featured Glen Benton as a session vocalist and continued the same musical style as Dechristianize. Vital Remains also released their first live DVD, Evil-Death-Live, through Polish label Metal Mind Productions. Dave Suzuki left the band, shortly after the release of Icons of Evil. =Recent activity and vocalists' deaths= Vital Remains continued touring, but experienced frequent lineup changes. Tony Lazaro, bassist Gaeton \\"Gator\\" Collier and former Infernaeon vocalist Brian Werner are the band's most consistent members since 2012. Tony claimed in interviews during 2012-2013 that he has \\"two albums worth of material.\\" In late 2014 and early 2015, the band added drummer James Payne (ex Hour of Penance), and Toronto-based Dean Arnold (of Primal Frost) as lead guitarist. Vital Remains toured South America, Europe and the United States in 2015. In November 2015, a Sanford Florida police officer was fired for singing \\"Let the Killing Begin\\" with the band, while he was on duty and in uniform. A video posted on YouTube shows Officer Andrew Ricks - in full uniform - making 'devil's horns' gesture and roaring the title words to the song. Three of the band's former vocalists died between 2017 and 2018. On July 4, 2017, Chris Ross was fatally shot by his brother-in-law, James Ball. On November 2, 2017, Scott Wiley was reported dead with no cause of death revealed, followed by Jake Raymond on June 25, 2018. On September 2, 2019, Brian Werner announced his decision to leave Vital Remains via his social media channels. The announcement was confirmed by the band on their Facebook and also opened an audition call for a live vocalist to join the band in their upcoming U.S. winter tour, and also stated their intention to finish and release their long- awaited seventh studio album in 2020. In October 31, 2019, the band announced on their Facebook that Scott Eames would be the band's new lead vocalist for their 30th anniversary tour. Style Vital Remains earlier work had minor use of keyboards and ambient noise. After Forever Underground, they removed those elements for a purely death metal approach. Elements of their music that distinguish them in their genre are the use of acoustic Spanish-style solos and their construction of very long songs, which is uncommon in the majority of death metal music. Many of the songs on more recent releases approach eight or nine minutes in length. With the addition of Dave Suzuki to the band, the lead guitar work took a much more prominent place within song structure. He also chose to employ a neoclassical style of soloing.

Its main access roads are Route 148, which passes through the town, and Autoroute 50 which passes to the north. History The area was part of the Petite-Nation Seigneury, formed in 1674 and originally owned by Fran√ßois de Laval, the first bishop of New France. The seigneury was acquired in 1803 by Joseph Papineau, who became its first civilian lord, and later sold it to his son Louis-Joseph Papineau. The area became of interest economically when England was forced to rely on its colonies for wood for construction of its vessels during the Napoleonic blockade of 1807. It was full of oaks, pines, and maples regarding which Surveyor Joseph Bouchette wrote in 1815: \\"the terrain rises and is covered with wood of the best species: oaks are of high quality and particularly of large size, suitable for the construction of vessels.\\" In 1815 the original mission of Notre Dame de Bonsecours was created and in 1821 a chapel dedicated to Notre-Dame de Bonsecours (Our Lady of Good Help) was constructed. On September 30, 1831, the bishop of Quebec Bernard- Claude Panet granted a petition signed by Denis-Benjamin Papineau and over 75 tenants for the formation of a parish. His decree called the new parish Notre- Dame-de-Bonsecours-de-la-Petite-Nation and also recommended the people of Bonsecours to acquire civil recognition from the Governor General of Canada, Lord Aylmer. On June 18, 1845, the Governor General of the Province of Canada, Charles Metcalfe, established local and municipal authorities in Lower Canada, under a new law passed by the provincial Parliament.An Act to repeal certain Ordinances therein mentioned, and to make better provision for the establishment of Local and Municipal Authorities in Lower Canada, S.Prov.C. 1845, c. 40. One of the new municipalities created was the Municipality of Petite-Nation, which included the Parish of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours-de-la- Petite-Nation. However, this municipality was abolished in 1847. On July 1, 1855, a new statute of the Province of Canada came into force,Lower Canada Municipal and Road Act, S.Prov.C. 1855, c. 100. which allowed the parish to get official civilian recognition, known as Parish Municipality of Notre-Dame- de-Bon-Secours-de-la-Petite-Nation. On August 22, 1878, Montebello separated from the parish municipality. In the 1870s, the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway was built, connecting Montreal to Ottawa. The rail-line went through the municipality of Notre-Dame, in what is now Fassett. The Canadian Pacific Railway bought the line in 1882.Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway - Useful Information for Ottawa area Genealogists and Local Historians In the late 1890s, there was a dispute between the municipality of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours and the Canadian Pacific Railway, which resulted in a court case that went all the way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, the highest court of appeal for the British Empire. A ditch beside the rail-line had become clogged, resulting in flooding on the neighbouring land, owned by Julien Gervais. The municipality issued an order to the CPR, directing it to clean the obstruction. The CPR refused, arguing that as a federally incorporated railway, it was not required to comply with provincial law. The Quebec courts held that the provincial law did apply,Cie de Chemin de Fer Canadien du Pacifique v Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours (Paroisse), 1897 CarswellQue 80, 7 Que. QB 121, para. 8. and the CPR appealed to the Judicial Committee. In 1899, the Judicial Committee ruled in favour of the municipality and upheld the order to clean the ditch, in the case known as Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v Notre Dame de Bonsecours.Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v Notre Dame de Bonsecours, [1899] AC 367 (PC), [1899 UKPC 22] (UKPC). The decision of the Judicial Committee continues to be cited with approval by the Supreme Court of Canada.Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., [1995 2 SCR 1028.] In the early 20th centre, the Canadian Pacific Railway built a small station here, and in 1906, the Thomas family, a post office. Both were named Fassett in honour of Jacob Sloat Fassett, President from 1904 until his death in 1924, of the Haskell Lumber Company renamed Fassett Lumber Company in 1910. Fassett was a lawyer and congressman from Elmira, New York who spent summers in a large beach estate he had built in Falmouth, Massachusetts on what is today known as Fassett's Point at the end of Little Island Road. In 1913, the parish of Saint-Fid√®le de Fassett was formed out of the Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours Parish, and in 1918, the municipality split along these parish boundaries. The large rural and forested area became the Parish Municipality of Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours-Partie-Nord (which became the Municipality of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours in 2003). In 1951, the Parish Municipality of Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours became the Municipality of Fassett, named after the Fassett Lumber Company.

Amateur website for astronomical observing with cameras By using either method of rapid internally stacked images, or very short exposure times, and using a TV monitor (for analog cameras) or a computer with readily available software (for USB cameras), video astronomy allows observers to see colour and detail that would not register to the eye. Because the image can be displayed on a monitor or television screen it allows multiple people to share 'live' images; using the internet it is possible for a worldwide audience to share such images. Live broadcasting websites exist for sharing live video astronomy feeds.http://www.nightskiesnetwork.com/ http://www.videoastronomylive.co.uk Video astronomy, combined with remote control of a telescope, allows anyone including disabled people to operate a telescope remotely, or observers in a light-polluted area to operate a telescope in another area, even another country. Other benefits of the highly sensitive cameras used in video astronomy are the ability to see through thin cloud, and the ability to see many faint objects in areas suffering from light pollution. The equipment used varies from webcams and basic security cameras to specialized video astronomy cameras. Recent growing interest in the video 'near-live' aspect of astronomy has brought about websites devoted purely to the practice http://ballaratman.wix.com/videoastronomy and forums for users of the equipment http://astrovideoforum.proboards.com/http://www.cloudynights.com/forum/73-electronically- assisted-astronomy/https://stargazerslounge.com/forum/123-video-astronomy/  Further reading  Joseph Ashley: Video Astronomy on the Go.

The band was co-founded and headed by Viktor Tsoi, who wrote the music and lyrics for almost all of the band's songs. Over the course of eight years, Kino had released over 90 songs spanning over seven studio albums, as well as releasing a few compilations and live albums. The band's music was also widely circulated in the form of bootleg recordings. Viktor Tsoi died in a car accident in 1990. Shortly after his passing, the band broke up after releasing their final album, consisting of songs that Tsoi and the group were working on in the months before his death. The band announced a reunion in 2020 with concerts in Saint-Petersburg, Moscow and other cities.https://www.gazeta.ru/culture/2019/10/12/a_12751424.shtml History =Early years= Kino was formed in 1981 by the members of two earlier groups from Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Palata No. 6 and Piligrimy. They initially called themselves Garin i giperboloidy after Aleksei Tolstoi's novel The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin. The group consisted of Viktor Tsoi, guitarist , and drummer . They began rehearsing, but Valinsky was drafted and had to leave the band. In the spring of 1982, they began to perform at the Leningrad Rock Club and met with the influential underground musician Boris Grebenshchikov. It was around this time that they finally changed the band's name to Kino.Rybin, Aleksey V. Kino S Samogo Na?ala I Do Samogo Konca. Moscow: Feniks, 2001. Print.

Since the band only consisted of two members, Grebenshchikov suggested that members of his band Aquarium assist the band in recording the album. These included cellist , flautist , and bassist . Since there was no drummer, they used a drum machine instead. This simple composition made the album sound lively and bright. Lyrically, it resembled earlier Soviet bard music for its romanticism of city life and the use of poetic language. The album consisted of thirteen songs and was named 45 in reference to its length. The group's popularity was rather limited at the time, so the album was not considered much of a success, and Tsoi stated later that the record had come out crudely and he should have recorded it differently.Kushnir, Alexander. 100 Great Albums of Soviet Rock. Moskow: Kraft+, 2003.

However, Tsoi lost interest in the project and they ceased recording. In the winter of 1983, they played several shows in Leningrad and Moscow and were sometimes accompanied by Aquarium drummer . Rybin was replaced by rehearsal bassist Maksim Kolosov and later, guitarist Yuri Kasparyan.

The band's responsibilities were split evenly between Tsoi and Rybin. Tsoi was in charge of the creative component, writing music and lyrics, while Rybin did all the administrative work, such as organizing concerts, rehearsals and recording sessions. In March 1983, a serious conflict broke out between them, the culmination of multiple differences between the two musicians. Tsoi was particularly annoyed that Rybin performed his songs, and not his own writing, while Rybin didn't like Tsoi's unconditional leadership of the group.Alexey Rybin . \\"And the fish and meat\\" ‚Äì Interview with Aleksei Rybin. ‚Äì Roxy, ‚Ññ 6, 1983.

These songs continued with the romanticism of 45, but also had darker undertones. Tsoi dismissed the recording as \\"only a rehearsal tape,\\" but many fans viewed it as Kino's second record. Nonetheless, it has never been recognized as a legitimate album by the band. =Nachalnik Kamchatki and growing fame (1984‚Äì1985)= In 1984, Kino released their sophomore album, Nachalnik Kamchatki (Russian: –ù–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫ –ö–∞–º—á–∞—Ç–∫–∏.) The title was inspired by Tsoi's job as a boiler plant operator (\\"nachalnik\\" means 'chief' or 'boss,' and \\"Kamchatka\\" is slang for 'a very faraway place' ‚Äì but also a folk name for the boiler plant where Tsoi worked, now his museum), as well as a reference to the 1967 Soviet comedy Nachalnik Chukotki (Russian: –ù–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫ –ß—É–∫–æ—Ç–∫–∏). Again, Grebenshchikov served as a producer and brought many of his friends to help with the record. Among them were Alexander Titov (bass guitar), Sergey Kuryokhin (keyboards), Pyotr Troshchenkov (drums), Vsevolod Gakkel (cello), Igor Butman (sax), and Andrey Radchenko (drums). Grebenshchikov himself played a small keyboard instrument. The album was minimalist in style, with sparse arrangements and usage of fuzz effects on Kasparyan's guitar. \\"The album was electric and somewhat experimental in sound and form. I cannot say that the sound and style orientation turned out the way we'd like to see it, but from the point of view of the experiment, it looked interesting,\\" said Tsoi later.Andrew Burlaka.

Popular Music in Leningrad-St Petersburg 1965‚Äì2005 . ‚Äì M.: Amphora, 2007. ‚Äì 416 p. ‚Äì After the album was finished, Tsoi formed the electric section of Kino, which included Kasparyan on lead guitar, Titov on bass guitar, and on percussion, and in May 1984, they began to actively rehearse a new concert program. Kino then performed at II Festival at the Leningrad Rock Club, where they were highly acclaimed and began to take off in popularity. The group soon became famous and started to tour the Soviet Union. In the summer, they participated in a critically acclaimed joint performance with Aquarium and other bands held in the Moscow suburb of under the close supervision of the state security forces. In 1985, Kino released their third album, Eto Ne Lyubov. =Noch and nationwide recognition (1985‚Äì1986)= In early 1985, Kino attempted to record another album, but Tsoi did not like producer interference in his work, and the project was left unfinished. Alexander Titov was a member of Aquarium as well as of Kino, and in November 1985, he decided to leave Kino in favour of the other group. He was replaced by jazz guitarist , who completed the classic lineup of the group that existed until its end. In January 1986, Andrei Tropillo released the unfinished record the band had recorded in his studio a few months earlier. The album, entitled Noch (English: 'night') was sold in two million copies, making the group famous far beyond the rock community. However, the band had an extremely negative view of the release of this album. They received very little money from the sales of the record, and the underground rock press also criticized the album. In the spring the band performed at the IV Festival Rock Club, where they received the grand prize for the song \\"–î–∞–ª—å—à–µ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –±—É–¥–µ–º –º—ã\\" (English: \\"From Now On, We'll Be in Charge.\\") In the summer, they travelled to Kyiv to make a film with Sergei Lysenko. In July, they performed at the Moscow Palace of Culture Engineering along with Aquarium and Alisa. Afterwards, the three bands released a compilation called Red Wave. The album sold 10,000 copies in California, becoming the first release of Soviet rock music in the West.–í—Å–µ–≤–æ–ª–æ–¥ –ì–∞–∫–∫–µ–ª—å . –ê–∫–≤–∞—Ä–∏—É–º –∫–∞–∫ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–± —É—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –∑–∞ —Ç–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Å–Ω—ã–º –∫–æ—Ä—Ç–æ–º.

The film Needle (, ), which he starred in, brought the band to even more prominence, and their 1988 album Gruppa krovi (Blood Type) brought them to the pinnacle of their popularity. Kasparyan had married the American Joanna Stingray, who brought the group high-quality equipment from abroad. Thus, the technical equipment Kino used on this album far exceeded the equipment they had access to on their earlier albums, and it was their first record technically on par with European and American recordings.Foss, Richard.

Noch was also released on vinyl by Melodiya in 1988. Kino performed on central television in the Soviet Union, and Assa, a 1987 film featuring Russian rock, showed Tsoi performing \\"Khochu Pereman!\\" (\\"I Want Change!\\") in front of a crowd of thousands. After this, Kino's popularity swept the country, and their music captured the minds of the Soviet youth of the 1980s. =Zvezda po imeni Solntse and global popularity (1989‚Äì1990)= Soon after gaining national fame, Kino began to receive invitations to perform from all over the Eastern Bloc and even from some foreign countries. They participated in a charity contest in Denmark to raise money for relief from the earthquake in Armenia and performed at the largest French rock festival in Bourges and at the Soviet-Italian festival Back in the U.S.S.R. in Melpignano. In 1989, they travelled to New York and held a premiere of The Needle, as well as a small concert. In 1989, they released Zvezda po imeni Solntse (English: A Star Called Sun), which was lonely, introspective, and sad, despite the fame the band was enjoying. Kino appeared on the popular Soviet television program Vzglyad and attempted to record several video clips. While Tsoi was unsatisfied with them and insisted that they be removed, they were nonetheless shown frequently on television.Marianne Tsoi, Alexander Zhytynsky Viktor Tsoi. Poems.

RIA Novosti (15 August 2007) Before Tsoi died, they had recorded several songs in Latvia, and the remaining members of Kino finished the album as a tribute to him. While it had no official title, it is often called the Black Album (Chorny albom) in reference to its all-black cover. It was released in December 1990, and shortly after, Kino and others close to Tsoi held a press conference announcing the end of the band.Alexander Kushnir. Chapter II.

His lyrics are characterized by a poetic simplicity. The ideas of liberty were present (one song was named \\"Mother Anarchy\\") but, on the whole, the band's message to the public was not overly or overtly political, except for the recurring theme of freedom. Their songs largely focused on man's struggle in life and dealt with such overarching themes as love, war, and the pursuit of liberty. Elements of daily life are also embedded in Kino's vocabulary (for instance, there is a song about the elektrichka, a commuter train many suburbanites use daily).Alex Polikovsky.

I‚Äôd written some lyrics that are based around conversations or arguments, so we thought about a record with two halves that contrast each other.

Initially there was an original painting created for each song and two others, a total of 14 paintings, in the Catch Without Arms Collection. These paintings, while abstract in nature, all contain elements directly and indirectly related to the song they portray. The artwork not only was an accompaniment to the album, but also the map to a treasure.

It has presented independent candidates on legislative elections. The first secretary of PC(AP) is Eduardo Art√©s. PC(AP) is a member of the International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity & Struggle) (ICMLPO) and the International Coordination of Revolutionary Parties and Organizations (ICOR).  History  The header of Acci√≥n Proletaria. The head of K. Marx, F. Engels, V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin are visible next to the hammer and sickle.The Chilean Communist Party (Proletarian Action) was founded on November 8, 1979, through a split from the now defunct Revolutionary Communist Party. In 1984 the party joined \\"Coordinadora de Organizaciones Revolucionarias\\". In the 90s-2000s, the party has been member of Movimiento Izquierda Democr√°tica Allendista, Unidos Venceremos and Juntos Podemos, leaving the latter after Guillermo Teillier (President of the Communist Party of Chile, a political party member of Juntos Podemos) called to support Concertaci√≥n (then the ruling center-left bloc) candidate Michelle Bachelet in the 2006 presidential elections. While in Juntos Podemos, the party proposed their general secretary, Eduardo Art√©s, as an independent senate candidate for West Santiago (being a non-registered party), earning 50.000 votes. In 2009 the party supported Art√©s as a candidate for the 2009 presidential election, but due to their non-registered nature, they were unable to register him in the electoral service. Since 2009 the party has called for spoiling votes and more recently, abstention, in order to illegitimate the current neoliberal governments and its electoral system. In the wake of the 2011‚Äì2012 Chilean protests, the party has seen an increased interest in high-school and university students, becoming an alternative to the more moderate Communist Youth of Chile.  Philosophy  The party displays itself as an alternative to the moderate \\"revisionist\\" views of the Communist Party of Chile and other Marxist organizations, usually calling them social-democrats and betrayers of classical Marxism-Leninism. This criticism has since increased since the death of Gladys Mar√≠n and the Carmona-Teillier era, mostly due to their Concertaci√≥n-Communist Party pact in the parliamentary elections, usually finding support in the far left and the non- parliamentary left.  Publications  The party publishes an annual magazine called Acci√≥n Proletaria magazine and a monthly newspaper, Remolino Popular.

The party was originally established as a pressure group in 1995 under the one-party system of the National Resistance Movement, as other political parties were not allowed until after the 2005 constitutional referendum. JEEMA has been participating in Uganda‚Äôs electoral politics and has fielded candidates at the presidential, parliamentary and local council levels since 1996. In 1996 and 2001, Kibirige Muhamad Mayanja, the first JEEMA party leader, contested for the Presidency of Uganda, and since then, the party has been represented in Uganda‚Äôs National Assembly. Currently, it is one of the five parties with representation in the 10th parliament and local governments. JEEMA‚Äôs first National Delegates Conference was held on 28 March 2004 at Kolping Hotel in Mityana, which saw the coming into force of the first party constitution, and the party was formally registered on 23 March 2005 after the referendum that re-instated a multi-party system in Uganda. Kibirige Muhamad Mayanja, who led the party from its inception in 1995, relinquished power to 33-year-old lawyer Asuman Basalirwa in 2010 at the party‚Äôs second Delegates Conference that was held at Tal Cottages in Rubaga. With Basalirwa at the helm of JEEMA, it marked the start of a carefully managed transition from the founding members to the new, young generation that have since occupied almost all senior positions of the party. JEEMA places significant importance on civil rights and justice, as well as constitutionalism, and the party tends to be the most popular among the country's minority Muslim population.  Origin of the name and symbols  The Justice Forum party, commonly known as JEEMA, was born out of its five cardinal principal goals: * Justice for all * Education for all * Economic revitalization * Morality and * African Unity The five principals became the acronym of the party which is more easily pronounceable, and is used as the party slogan. The party emblem and campaign sign is an index finger and thumb in a ‚ÄúV‚Äù shape, and the party motto is \\"justice for all.\\"  Ideology  JEEMA defines itself as a \\"social justice and welfare party,\\" and declines to label itself as capitalist, communist, or socialist. JEEMA is in favour of free essential social services (like health and education) to all citizens, moral and ethical conduct in government and politics, a free but regulated market to avoid unchecked capitalist exploitation, and pursues a \\"people first\\" concept of development, where all matters affecting the nation should be decided through grassroots consultation. JEEMA stands for full dignity and respect to women, religions, races and ethnicities among other social groupings people identify with, and total respect and dignity to all nations of the world with no nation superior to another. The party supports a transition to proportional representation and the Westminster system at the national level, saying that Uganda has never had an election that has not been disputed by other players in the race and that the first-past-the-post voting system promotes more focus on an individual's personal beliefs rather than that of their constituents, which is a recipe for corruption.

The story deals with the sensationalism of tabloid news and the political climate of panic over Red Army Faction terrorism in the 1970s Federal Republic of Germany. The main character, Katharina Blum, is an innocent housekeeper whose life is ruined by an invasive tabloid reporter and a police investigation when the man with whom she has just fallen in love turns out to be wanted by the police because of a bank robbery. The book's fictional tabloid paper, Die Zeitung (The Newspaper), is modelled on the actual German Bild-Zeitung. Plot Four days after a Weiberfastnacht's eve party (Wed. 20 February 1974), where Katharina Blum met a man named Ludwig G√∂tten, she calls on Oberkommissar Moeding and confesses to killing a journalist for the newspaper Die Zeitung. Katharina had met G√∂tten at a friend's party and spent the night with him before helping him to escape from the police. The next morning, the police break into her house, arrest her and question her. The story is sensationally covered by Die Zeitung, and in particular its journalist T√∂tges. T√∂tges investigates everything about her life, calling on Katharina's friends and family, including her ex-husband and hospitalized mother, who dies the day after T√∂tges visits her. He paints a picture of Katharina as a fervent accomplice of G√∂tten, and as a communist run amok in Germany. Katharina arranges an interview with T√∂tges. According to Katharina, upon his arrival he suggests that they have sex, whereupon she shoots him dead. She then wanders the city for a few hours before driving to police headquarters and confessing to murder. The book also details the effects of the case on Katharina's employers and friends the Blornas; Mr Blorna is her lawyer, and Mrs Blorna one of the designers of the apartment block where Katharina resides. Their association with Katharina leads to their exclusion from society. Style The story is written from a first-person plural perspective, as if the narrator were presenting a confidential report to the reader on the basis of sources. The technique is documentary, as with Group Portrait with Lady, but with a much more disciplined focus on essentials. The reader is sometimes left to infer who the sources are for many of the reports, and even to wonder whether the narrator may not be one of the characters in the novel. This way, the narrator is dependent on characters and the information they impart, becoming a researcher and critic of his source material. This is implicitly contrasted with the journalists who irresponsibly distort their sources. The attack on vulgar journalism is thus mounted from the perspective of a narrator whose moral authority is enhanced by the use of the 'regal' first-person plural form. In some parts of the story, the elaborate and detached manner is also used for comic effect when retelling violent, silly or emotionally conflicted incidents as more and more personal secrets of the characters are revealed. Adaptations The book has been adapted into the following works: * The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum, a 1975 film adaptation of B√∂ll's novel directed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff and Margarethe von Trotta and starring Angela Winkler as Blum, Mario Adorf as Kommissar Beizmenne, Dieter Laser as T√∂tges and J√ºrgen Prochnow as Ludwig * The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck, a 1984 TV movie starring Marlo Thomas as Blum and Kris Kristofferson as Ben Cole * Heinrich Boll - The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum, a radio dramatisation in five parts broadcast as the 15 Minute Drama of the week (formerly the Woman's Hour Drama) on BBC Radio Four for the week commencing 15 October 2012 * Katharina Blum, an opera adaptation by Tilo Medek to a libretto by his wife Dorothea based on the B√∂ll novel, which premiered at the Theater Bielefeld on 20 April 1991 See alsoLe Monde 100 Books of the Century References =General=      Beth, Hanno. \\"Rufmord und Mord: die publizistische Dimension der Gewalt.

The band was formed in 1995 and currently consists of Justin Furstenfeld (lead vocals, guitar), Jeremy Furstenfeld (drums, percussion), Ryan Delahoussaye (violin/viola, mandolin, piano, backing vocals), Matt Noveskey (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Will Knaak (lead guitar). The band has had eleven Top 40 singles over their past seven studio albums and is best known for their platinum singles \\"Hate Me\\" and \\"Into the Ocean\\" from their 2006 platinum album Foiled. History =Early years= Blue October was formed by lead singer/ songwriter/guitarist Justin Furstenfeld, his brother Jeremy and multi-instrumentalist Ryan Delahoussaye. The band was discovered by former Kid Rock manager Michael Rand performing at the Pappadeaux Cafe in Houston in 1998. His agency proceeded to book over 350 dates on the group unsigned. Extensive publicity and artist development was regimented. This work eventually led to Michael bringing the band to Universal Music Group CEO Doug Morris under the direction of long time A&R; rep Reen Nalli. The group moved to San Marcos, Texas in December 1996 and were signed to Universal Records in 1999. Managed by Justin and Jeremy's parents under the name RoDan Entertainment, Blue October released their first album, The Answers, in 1998; a well-received debut which sold over 5,000 copies in Houston alone. Due to a fan-based connection with ABC's KTRK-TV (Channel 13), Blue October was able to schedule an early-morning news performance ‚Äì the band's first live television performance. Other unreleased songs from this period, such as \\"Rust\\", \\"Colorado 5591\\", \\"His Name Is Crazy\\", \\"Gun Metal Blue\\", \\"Dollar 30 Gravy\\", and \\"5 Day Walk\\" can be found on YouTube. Blue October caught the attention of the major record labels while working with producer dB (Don Byczynski) in early 1998. Pre-production started for getting Blue October a more \\"radio ready\\" sound, with new songs and to rewrite material off The Answers. Tracking was done in a studio setup at Justin's home in San Marcos, Texas. The recordings were sent to Universal, then in 1999 Blue October signed to Universal Records for the release of their second album, Consent to Treatment. The band was dropped by Universal Records in 2000. After being dropped, the band recruited new guitarist C.B. Hudson and got back on the road. In November 2002 the band signed with Texas-based management company Rainmaker Artists. Rainmaker immediately signed to their record label. Just before entering the studio Matt Noveskey left the band for personal reasons. The remaining band members persevered on, entering the studio to record what would be become their third album History for Sale. The first single from History For Sale was \\"Calling You\\" released in February 2003. On March 20, 2003 radio station \\"102.1 the EDGE\\" in Dallas added \\"Calling You\\" to regular rotation, and it began to spread to radio stations across the country receiving over 56,585 spins on the US airwaves. Rainmaker took the band to New York where the band played multiple live showcases over a week period in early May 2003 for Atlantic Records, Columbia Records and Universal Records. Blue October was then offered records deals by each company. Ultimately the band returned to Universal Republic Records in May 2003. History for Sale was then re-released on Universal Republic in August 2003. History for Sale was largely a response to the control Universal had placed on the group during the Consent to Treatment production process. This is evident in songs such as \\"Somebody\\" and \\"Inner Glow\\". \\"Calling You\\" remained the group's largest mainstream success until their 2006 single, \\"Hate Me\\". = 2006‚Äì2010 = The band made their network television premiere on April 14, 2006, performing \\"Hate Me\\", the first single from Foiled on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. They appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on June 28, 2006. Blue October was also on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2006. On November 14, 2006 Blue October opened for the Rolling Stones in Boise, Idaho. Hate Me was released to Modern Rock radio stations and quickly climbed to number two on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart. Hate Me remained in the top five of the Modern Rock chart for 20 straight weeks. While in the number two chart position \\"Hate Me\\" was jumped over twice by both Pearl Jam and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. \\"Hate Me\\" would never reach number one. The music video for \\"Hate Me\\" debuted on VH1, later making a splash at No. 13 on VH1's user-controlled video countdown show VSpot Top 20 Countdown. It eventually peaked at No. 2 for the week ending on May 5, 2006. \\"Into the Ocean\\", the second single from the album, was released on July 17, 2006. The music video for the song debuted at number three on VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown during the show's final week of 2006 and reached the number one spot in mid- February 2007. \\"Into the Ocean\\" hit No. 20 on the Modern Rock Tracks. The next single from the band was \\"She's My Ride Home\\", which they performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on April 25, 2007. On February 22, 2007 Blue October's fourth album \\"Foiled\\" was certified platinum. \\"Foiled\\" went on to sell 1.4 million albums in the US. Both \\"Hate Me\\" and \\"Into the Ocean\\" were also certified as platinum selling singles. This was heralded as a special moment for the band, Rainmaker, Brando, and key executives at Universal Republic who had signed, dropped and then resigned the band. As a result of reaching a new audience that Blue October has found with its Foiled album, Blue October has recently undergone an expansion of its tour locations. Originally restricted to Texas and parts of the Midwest and Southwest United States, Blue October began touring locations covering the entire continental United States, in addition adding locations in Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, England, France, Ireland, Scotland, Germany and the Netherlands to their schedule. In August 2008, Justin featured in a sold out four-city tour with Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight series. During this tour, Justin premiered two new songs, \\"Blue Skies\\" and \\"My Never\\", which would be included on the band's fifth studio album. Twilight author Stephanie Meyer is a fan of Blue October, and their music has helped inspire part of the popular book series. The band's fifth studio album, Approaching Normal, was released on March 24, 2009. It was distributed via‚Äîas its predecessors‚ÄîUniversal. Rather than Justin Furstenfeld producing the album, Approaching Normal was produced by Steve Lillywhite (U2, Peter Gabriel, Dave Matthews Band). The album debuted at No. 13 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band released two versions of the album, each with a different bonus track: an \\"explicit\\" version, with \\"The End\\" as the bonus track, and a \\"clean\\" version, with \\"Graceful Dancing\\" as the bonus track. \\"Graceful Dancing\\" was also released in late 2008 as a \\"special gift\\" to fans signed under the band's email list. \\"Dirt Room\\" was the first single from the album, released on December 23, 2008. \\"Dirt Room\\" became Blue October's second Top 5 Modern Rock single (fourth Top 40 Modern Rock hit) peaking at number 7 on April 8, 2009. \\"Say It\\" was released as the second single on April 24, 2009. \\"Say It\\" was Blue October's fifth Top 40 Modern Rock hit peaking at number 29 on July 24, 2009. \\"Say it\\" also crossed over to the Hot AC radio format giving the band its fourth Top 40 Hot AC hit peaking at number 28 on October 13, 2009. The song was first performed at Edgefest 17 on April 27, 2008, in Dallas, Texas. In May 2009, Blue October's show in Pittsburgh was cancelled by the Fire Marshal and the Pittsburgh Police Department due to overcrowding and unsafe conditions. Not wanting to disappoint fans, the band set up their gear on the corner outside the venue and played a mini-set to the delight of fans. On October 22, 2009, Blue October announced that the rest of the tour had been canceled due to Justin Furstenfield suffering a severe mental anxiety attack. He returned to perform at Stubb's Outdoor Amphitheater in Texas a month or two after his attack. The tour was rescheduled in 2010. In July 2010 Blue October played a series of acoustic concerts that were recorded for a live unplugged album, entitled Ugly Side: An Acoustic Evening With Blue October, released on May 10, 2011. In February 2011, the band announced on their website that they will embark on an acoustic tour between March and May 2011. = 2010‚Äì2019 = On June 1, 2010 the band announced they were beginning pre-production on their next studio album to be produced by Tim Palmer. In late 2010 and early 2011, they headed back to the studio to finish recording the album and debuted it August 16, 2011. The title of the new album is Any Man in America. During the week of February 14‚Äì18, Blue October singer Justin Furstenfeld did a stint as a guest DJ on Austin's KROX-FM radio station. Justin previewed four new tracks on the air, presumably on the new album, titled \\"The Chills\\", \\"The Waiting, \\"The Getting Over It Part\\" and \\"The Flight (Lincoln to Minneapolis)\\". On April 3, 2011 Justin Furstenfeld announced that the album would be distributed by RED Distribution, a Sony imprint for independent artists. Their former label, Universal Motown had offered them a 360 deal, which the band rejected, opting instead to become independent and form their own label, Up/Down Records. On May 4, 2011 Blue October played the first full song of the new album live, called \\"The Feel Again\\". On May 6, 2011 Blue October played a second song in Saint Louis, Missouri from their upcoming album titled \\"The Follow Through\\". Justin performed a duet with Patricia from the band \\"The Soldier Thread\\" for the song. On July 25, 2011, the official music video for the first single, \\"The Chills\\", was released via the Vevo channel. On August 16, 2011 \\"Any Man in America\\" was released in the US. On August 25, 2011 \\"Any Man in America\\" debuted at number 8 on the Billboard Album Sales Chart giving Blue October their first top 10 album sales chart debut. On September 24, 2011 \\"The Chills\\" the first single from \\"Any Man in America\\" peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart giving Blue October their 6th Top 40 Modern Rock radio hit. In October 2012 Justin Furstenfeld had nearly completed writing the songs for Blue October's seventh album. He entered the studio with the band and producer David Castell (who also co-produced Foiled and produced History For Sale) at the beginning of 2013. The official release date was August 20, 2013. The band released the first single from the album in February 2013. One song, \\"Light You Up\\" made its live debut on October 7, 2012 in Millvale, Pa. On Tuesday, December 18, the band released a new single called \\"The Scar\\", which is a Blue October rendition of a 5591 song. Drummer Jeremy Furstenfeld announced on Twitter that the band started rehearsals for the new album on January 14, 2013. They ended rehearsals on January 30 and were prepared to enter the studio to start recording the album. On February 5, 2013, the band entered the studio to start recording the new album.

Prior to forming the full band, the duo played together under the name \\"Harvest\\" with Justin singing and playing guitar and Ryan playing mandolin and violin and singing backup. Ryan was working at a restaurant in Houston at the time, and invited restaurant patron Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Rapstein Phillips (n√©e Mulally) to join on bass after striking up a conversation upon noticing she had a drum tuning key on her keychain. Justin's older brother Jeremy was watching the group practice at Liz's house one day. Liz had a drum kit and Justin persuaded Jeremy to join in on drums, even though he had never played before. The band played their first show soon after Jeremy joined. Jeremy lived in San Marcos, and the other members (except Liz) moved to join him there in 1996. Liz left the band in 1998 and was replaced by Matt Noveskey. The band wanted to add a second guitar player to allow Justin to focus more on singing during shows, and auditioned guitar players in 1999. Brant Coulter was chosen as lead guitarist, however he left the band in late 2000 when Blue October was dropped from Universal Records. C.B. Hudson joined on lead guitar in late 2000 after a chance meeting with Justin at a restaurant in San Marcos. At the end of the Consent to Treatment tour in 2002, Matt Noveskey left the band due to health reasons and was replaced by Dwayne Casey. Dwayne and Matt both played on the band's next album, History for Sale, and Dwayne toured with the band in 2003. In August 2003 Dwayne was replaced by Piper Skih Swinford (n√©e Dagnino), who is married to one of Blue October's co- managers and is also an established professional bassist. Piper toured with the band through 2004 and appeared on the live album/DVD Argue With a Tree... During preparations for recording the band's next album Foiled, Matt Novesky was called back in as the official bassist, thereby returning the band to their most recognizable lineup. This lineup recorded and toured the next two Blue October albums. At the end of the Approaching Normal tour, C.B. Hudson announced he was leaving the band to focus on raising a family and pursuing his dream of owning a recording studio. C.B. was replaced by former Canvas guitarist Julian Mandrake who had previously been a touring guitarist for Blue October in 2006, covering Justin's guitar parts while Justin was recovering from a knee injury. Julian played with Blue October on their Ugly Side acoustic tour and also on the Any Man in America tour. During the recording sessions for Sway in early 2013, C.B. Hudson was asked to come back and play on the album and to play shows over mid-2013, once again returning Blue October to their previous lineup. C.B. recorded with Blue October for their 2016 album Home and appeared in publicity photos with the band, however he had to take a leave from the band due to a collarbone injury sustained during a dirt bike accident and Matthew Ostrander filled in on lead guitar in 2016 for the Home tour. On April 13, 2016 it was confirmed that C.B. would not be returning. On January 24, 2018 Matthew Ostrander posted a video on instagram announcing he had informed the band ten days prior that he was stepping down. In February 2018, Will Knaak was announced as the new lead guitarist.

Systems that previously seemed to offer protection from risks both natural and social are increasingly recognised as producing new man-made risks on a global scale as a byproduct of their functioning .

The EuroLeague Final Four MVP in 1994, his sixteen and a half seasons career was mostly spent in Yugoslavia and Greece, along with several short stints in the NBA, France, and Italy. Since 2009, he has been vice-president of the Serbian Olympic Committee. For years, Paspalj was an automatic choice for Yugoslavia's senior national team, representing his country in one FIBA World Cup, two Olympics, and four EuroBaskets. He earned an All-EuroBasket Team selection in 1989. Early life Paspalj's forester father Jovan moved from a small village on the slopes of Kozara in Bosanska Krajina to Pljevlja on business as he dealt in lumber trade. Once there he married a local woman, Mileva, and remained. Their first child, son Darko, was born in 1961, five years before ≈Ωarko was born in 1966. During the mid-1970s, when young ≈Ωarko was ten years old, his father's job requirements moved the family to Titograd. ≈Ωarko took up basketball and soon established himself in the youth system of KK Buduƒánost. He considers himself an ethnic Serb from Montenegro, which he believes is \\"only natural\\". Club career =Early days in Titograd= Paspalj began his career in 1982. At 16 he moved up to Buduƒánost's first team where he was part of a talented generation alongside Zdravko Raduloviƒá and Luka Paviƒáeviƒá. At the time, Buduƒánost was a small, unambitious side that had played its first ever top-tier season two years earlier in 1980‚Äì81, essentially serving as talent feeder for bigger Yugoslav League clubs like Partizan, Cibona, Jugoplastika, Crvena zvezda, and Bosna. Constantly in danger of relegation, Buduƒánost sometimes banked on more than just its own quality for top-league survival. There is an unconfirmed story that became a bit of local urban legend from the early 1980s when Paspalj was a junior, about Cibona coming to Titograd for a late season game which was meaningless for Zagreb side but crucial for Buduƒánost's hopes of remaining in the top division. The story goes that a deal was struck between two sides to allow the home team to win, while in return Cibona management got to watch Buduƒánost's juniors practice and take whichever player they liked back to Zagreb. Knowing Paspalj was by far their best young prospect and an asset that would soon be worth a lot of money, Buduƒánost's club management wouldn't let him train for a few days, which meant that Cibona never saw him and therefore picked another player. Not too long after that, Paspalj entered the senior squad. Playing under young head coach Milutin Petroviƒá and alongside seasoned Yugoslav League players such as the Ivanoviƒá brothers (Du≈°ko and Dragan), the talented youngster contributed greatly to Buduƒánost's third place league finish in the 1985‚Äì86 season and a playoff semi-final where they lost to eventual champions Zadar. =Partizan years= During the summer of 1986 Buduƒánost sold 20-year-old Paspalj to Partizan. Eighteen-year-old Vlade Divac, another rising star, also joined the club that summer from Sloga. Together with young Sasha Djordjevic, ≈Ωeljko Obradoviƒá and more established players like Milenko Savoviƒá and Goran Grboviƒá, they won the national title in a final against Crvena zvezda. Paspalj played well enough to earn a spot on the national team of Yugoslavia that won the Bronze at the EuroBasket 1987 in Athens, Greece. The following year, in 1988, he played a leading role in the side that made it to the Olympic final against the Soviet Union, and marked himself out as a potential star with some fine performances for Yugoslavia at the 1988 McDonald's Open. Also in 1988, Paspalj top-scored for Yugoslavia at the prestigious Acropolis Tournament in Athens, which included 26 points in one half in a tough-fought 104-103 victory against US college side Duke. =Season in the NBA= In the summer of 1989 Paspalj became one of the first Europeans to move to the NBA, joining the San Antonio Spurs despite going undrafted one year earlier.Global discoveries: Spurs serve as pioneers in scouting European talent;San Antonio Express-News, 30 September 2006 He came into the league alongside two Soviets (≈†ar≈´nas Marƒçiulionis and Alexander Volkov) and two more fellow Yugoslavs (Dra≈æen Petroviƒá and Vlade Divac) as they collectively were dubbed the \\"green card five\\" by Sports Illustrated.Many Happy Returns;Sports Illustrated, 6 November 1989 At the time they were the only five players in the entire NBA who didn't come up through the American collegiate system. They were thus followed on both sides of the Atlantic with extra interest as the public was curious to see how foreigners fare in the world's best league.It's a Different World, but NBA's Imports Make Progress;Los Angeles Times, 25 February 1990 Paspalj came to the Spurs courtesy of Gregg Popovich, the team's assistant coach at the time, who saw the 23-year-old at a warm-up tournament in Dortmund, Germany in early June where the Yugoslav national team had been preparing for EuroBasket 1989 later that month. Liking Paspalj's game, Popovich established initial contact with the player through Paspalj's national squad training camp teammate Zoran Jovanoviƒá who spoke English having played college ball at Louisiana State while retired basketball player Neboj≈°a Bukumiroviƒá also participated as an operational liaison in the subsequent transfer process from Partizan to San Antonio. When approached by Popovich about coming to the Spurs, Paspalj immediately expressed interest despite later admitting to never actually believing anything would come of it as the notion of playing basketball in the NBA seemed vague and far fetched to him. Nevertheless, the acquisition was finalized following the EuroBasket championship where Yugoslavia won gold in dominating fashion with Paspalj making the All-Tournament Team by contributing 13.4 points per game over five games, all of them blowout wins for the rampant Yugoslavs. In 2015 Paspalj recalled his final few days in Yugoslavia in summer 1989 before setting off for America: Upon arriving to the United States in early July, months before the other four Europeans, and signing a $350,000 per season contract, Paspalj even ended up living in Popovich's house for a few weeks as he acclimatized to the new surroundings. Shortly after landing, he was off to California to play Summer League. Once the season started, Paspalj found himself relegated to the role of 21-year-old rookie Sean Elliott's backup, mostly getting to play garbage time minutes at the end of games. Paspalj reportedly drew head coach Larry Brown's ire by admitting he played \\"no defense, only offense.\\" He also confessed a weakness for Pizza Hut and Marlboros. Midway through the season, the Spurs organization even resorted to sending Paspalj to a hypnotist in order to curb his smoking habit, though the treatment ended up not succeeding.It's a Different World, but NBA's Imports Make Progress;Los Angeles Times, 25 February 1990 The highlight of his forgettable season came on 20 January 1990 away at Denver when he scored 13 points during 14 minutes on the floor in 126-99 loss versus the Nuggets. Paspalj got cut from the team three days before the 1990 NBA Playoffs started, as the team officials wanted to make roster room for veteran forward Mike Mitchell. His NBA move turned out to be far from successful as he featured in only 28 games during the season, scoring a total of 72 points in 181 minutes (2.6 points and 6¬Ω minutes per game) of action. However, Paspalj did develop a cult following among fans, evidenced by the Terry Cummings-penned song \\"The Mark of Zarko\\", which was sung to the tune of \\"The Mark of Zorro.\\" Local press in San Antonio also took to him due to the folksy manner in which he conducted his media appearances with stream-of-consciousness answers and quotable sound bytes. Summing up his season with the Spurs and life in the United States, Paspalj remarked in 2015: The 1989-90 season did have a golden lining for Paspalj as he was an integral part of the Yugoslav team which took gold at the Goodwill Games in Seattle, beating the United States in the final, and at the World Championships in Argentina, with Paspalj leading all scorers in the final against the Soviet Union with 20 points. =Back in Partizan for a season= In 1990 Paspalj returned home to Partizan. The club, much like the player, was coming off an extremely poor season in which they failed to earn a European spot. Also returning, following an unsuccessful season of his own in Spain, was Paspalj's mentor Du≈°ko Vujo≈°eviƒá. Seen as a reunion from a few years earlier, but this time without the rigours of competing in Europe, the season was shaping up as the one in which Partizan could finally overcome its Jugoplastika hex after the Split club was left without its talismanic coach Bo≈æa Maljkoviƒá and its key player Dino Raƒëa. Paspalj became the league's top- scorer for 1990‚Äì91, leading the team alongside 23-year-old ƒêorƒëeviƒá and 20-year-old Daniloviƒá to the second-place regular season finish and then another playoff final where the old nemesis Split (now renamed Pop 84) awaited. Still, even a Raƒëa-less Pop 84 team was too much as it swept Partizan 3-0. Nonetheless, the overall season performance earned Paspalj a high-profile transfer to Greek club Olympiacos in the late summer of 1991. =Olympiacos= Paspalj's signing for the Piraeus club was a direct consequence of its takeover by Greek businessman and investor Sokratis Kokkalis. Throwing his considerable financial means behind the operation, he wanted to turn Olympiacos, a club that hadn't won the Greek title since 1978 and languished in mediocrity for years, into a European power. Also signing the same summer was head coach Giannis Ioannidis who dominated Greek basketball throughout the 1980s as head coach of Aris, having led them to seven national titles and several EuroLeague Final Four appearances. Paspalj's arrival to Athens in September 1991, just over two months after helping the Yugoslav national team successfully defend its EuroBasket title, received major attention in the city with many Olympiacos fans greeting him at Ellinikon Airport. Being the first foreign superstar to join the league, the 25-year-old's arrival was seen by many as the harbinger of a new era for Greek club basketball.Zarko Paspalj, the man who changed the Greek League;EuroLeague, 2 December 2012 1991‚Äì92 season In 1991‚Äì92 season Paspalj almost single-handedly inspired Olympiacos, a team that finished in 8th place in Greek league the previous year, to the play-off finals against PAOK from Thessaloniki. Olympiacos lost 97-82, but Paspalj top-scored with 35 points on 8/9 free throws, 12/20 two- pointers and 1/2 three-pointers. During the season, Paspalj scored an average of 33.7 points per game. In his very first game, he scored 38 out of the 67 points of his team as Olympiacos defeated the seven-time defending champion Aris 67-59 in the opening game of the season (16/19, 8/19, 2/7). Several games later, Paspalj scored exactly half his team's points against Panathinaikos as he poured in 39 points in a 78-76 victory. One of his best performances saw him score 46 points in a 94-83 victory over Panionios, on 11/14, 13/22, 3/5. Playing on a fairly modest squad led by head coach Ioannidis, Paspalj was the go-to player in almost every match, capable of scoring from almost any angle and distance with his outside shooting a particularly deadly weapon in his arsenal. In the crucial game in the convoluted group stage of the play-offs that was used at that time, against Aris, which Olympiacos needed to win to have a chance of making the final, Paspalj went scoreless for the first quarter of the game but still ended up with 38 points (16/17, 8/16, 2/5) that powered Olympiacos to a 94-83 victory. Paspalj went on to score 30 points (11/13, 8/17, 1/3) in the game against PAOK that secured Olympiacos's first trip back to a title game in a decade. However PAOK defeated Olympiacos for the title. Other memorable games that season included a 39-point performance against arch-rivals Panathinaikos and a 43-point outburst against AEK, 40 points against Aris in the quarter-final of the Greek Cup which were the sole highlight for his team in a lopsided 121-95 loss, while in another he game he ended with 22/22 free-throws, a record of consistency that still stands as of 2015 and contrasted sharply with Paspalj's later, sudden, loss of shooting ability. On the national team front, Paspalj was denied the chance to participate in the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, due to the sanctions imposed on FR Yugoslavia. 1992‚Äì93 season In his second season at Olympiacos, 1992‚Äì93, Paspalj benefited from a strengthened team (acquisitions of Walter Berry, Dragan Tarlaƒá, Milan Tomiƒá, Giorgos Sigalas and Franko Nakiƒá) and Olympiacos won the Greek League championship, defeating arch-rivals Panathinaikos in a controversial final series to claim their first championship since 1978. Paspalj played a crucial role in the triumph with a series of memorable matches against Aris in the play-off quarter-finals (when he scored 44 points ‚Äì 9/10, 13/22, 3/4) and PAOK in the semi-finals. He also top-scored in the final series, all of which Olympiacos won without home advantage. Paspalj scored an average of 25 points per game, including 29 points as Olympiacos defeated Aris 66-50 in Thessaloniki in a game which marked Aris's first home defeat against a team other than PAOK for nearly eleven years and 129 games, and a career-high 54 against Dafni on the opening day of the season in a game that Olympiacos remarkably lost 103-105, but he effectively cost his team a place in the 1993 EuroLeague Final Four, when he stepped over the line in the dying seconds of the crucial play-off match against Limoges CSP of France. As of 2015, Paspalj's 54-point game against Dafni remains the last 50-point plus performance in Greek basketball's top division. 1993‚Äì94 season During the summer 1993 transfer window, Olympiacos brought in Roy Tarpley, a supreme talent who having been banished from the NBA due to multiple drunk-driving incidents just completed a great season for Sato Aris. The 1993‚Äì94 season saw Olympiacos crowned League and Cup double champions in Greece. However Paspalj's shooting statistics deteriorated alarmingly during the year as he became a far more erratic player, capable of scoring in bursts or not at all. In particular his free-throw percentage nose- dived from 86% to under 50% and this led to a traumatic experience at the European League Final Four in Tel Aviv in April 1994, when Paspalj missed a crucial free throw, with four seconds left, as Olympiacos suffered a shock defeat in the final, 59-57 to 7up Joventut. Paspalj was voted the EuroLeague Final Four MVP, but the vote took place at half-time in the final, with Olympiacos seemingly headed for victory. However, although he added to his team-high of 22 points, in the semi-final against Panathinaikos, with another team-high 15 points in the final, all his points came in the first half, and he ended with 3 of 10 free-throw shooting, and later admitted to Greek television that he knew before he took the final free-throw, which he needed to score to have a chance of saving the match, that he would miss. This mental block would plague Paspalj for the remainder of his career. It transformed one of the European game's finest shooters, into a centre‚Äìforward, who relied on his experience, guile and skill on the fast break, to penetrate opposing defenses. He remained an enormously talented player, with a wealth of experience, but lost something of the vitality and spontaneity of his earlier years, when his outside shooting was often deadly effective. In what would prove to be his final Greek League appearance for Olympiacos, in the fifth playoff game against PAOK Bravo, in 1994, Paspalj memorably rolled back the years as he scored 30 points to lead Olympiacos to a hard-fought 70-65 victory, to take the series 3-2. Following a series of below-par performances, in which his shooting percentage had dipped alarmingly, Paspalj memorably made 3/4 free throws, 12/20 two-point shots and hit a buzzer-beater three-pointer to close the first half. This consistent shooting was reminiscent of his first two, memorable, years, and contrasted sharply with the scenes at the end of Game 1 when, after having shot 1 from 7 from the free-throw line, Paspalj made two free throws in the final seconds to immense jubilation and celebration from the stands and from teammates and opposition players alike. In his very last game for Olympiacos, in the Greek Cup final against Iraklis, he scored 17 points (3/9, 7/13, 0/2) and ended up chucking his last free throw toward the basket underarm as his shooting touch deserted him yet again. Paspalj was asked many times to account for the sudden and dramatic loss of his shooting confidence and while he was unable to pinpoint any one cause, remarking on one occasion that the shot was a mechanism that he done for years without any problems until he began to miss regularly and question himself in the act of shooting, it is clear from television footage that his posture on shooting shifted significantly and, for reasons unknown, his unorthodox swing-shot became far more pronounced in the later, more erratic years of his career. However, Paspalj, in 1995, said that he never watched television footage of games he played in, and acknowledged that had been a mistake, as somewhere he had gone wrong in the act of shooting. =Season with Panathinaikos= In August 1994 Paspalj caused a sensation by transferring to bitter Athenian rivals Panathinaikos. Relations between Paspalj and the Olympiakos leadership had deteriorated during the summer and his departure to their arch-rivals infuriated Olympiacos fans. Arriving to the club hungry for trophies and financed by the Giannakopoulous brothers' pharmaceutical business, his signing was seen as a big coup for Panathinaikos ‚Äì not only were the greens getting a marquee player in the prime of his career, but at the same time they also managed to weaken their biggest rival by luring away their best player. Therefore, the expectations were also big ‚Äì success in both the domestic league and the EuroLeague was paramount. Coming into the squad that featured head coach Efthimis Kioumourtzoglou, Nikos Galis, Panagiotis Giannakis, Stojko Vrankoviƒá, Miroslav Pecarski, Tiit Sokk, Aivar Kuusmaa, Kostas Patavoukas, Fragiskos Alvertis and Nikos Oikonomou, Paspalj was seen as the ingredient capable of leading the team to big trophies. Predictably, Olympiacos fans immediately turned on their former hero and hounded him whenever the two teams met. This initially intimidated Paspalj, as chance had it that his first game for Panathinaikos was against Olympiacos in the Greek Cup, played at the neutral venue ‚Äì Sporting's indoor hall that at the time barely seated 1,500 people. There, in a cramped arena filled with passionate fans of both teams, he played one of the worst, most nerve-wracked games of his career, and finished with 5 points (1/2, 2/11, 0/1) as Panathinaikos won a terrible game 42-40. By contrast, a month later, an inspired Paspalj, in his first league appearance against Olympiacos, memorably began the game with three consecutive 3-pointers in the opening minute, though he subsequently faded as his team lost 65-67. However the move across town couldn't hide the flaws in Paspalj's game and his shot continued to deteriorate. His free throw percentage dipped still further and in many games was well below 50%, while three-point shots became a rarity, with just one three-pointer from eight attempts in the entire EuroLeague season. He was the top-scorer for his new team with 19 points per game but failed to lift them beyond second place in the Greek League and the semi-finals of the EuroLeague, when in both cases Panathinaikos was defeated by Olympiacos, which made even the Panathinaikos fans disillusioned with him. The return league game against Olympiacos, which Panathinaikos won 74-72 away from home, typified Paspalj's up-and-down season, as he began brightly with 8 points in the opening minutes, faded and remained scoreless until the last minute of the game, then scored the last five points that steered Panathinaikos to victory, but missed a free throw with 3 seconds remaining that ultimately cost his team the head-to-head record that gave Olympiacos the crucial home court advantage throughout the play-offs. Paspalj's performances in the five-game playoff final series with Olympiacos were particularly disappointing, as although he scored 21 and 19 points in games 2 and 4 (when Panathinaikos played at home), he hit just 18 points in the three games played on Olympiacos territory, including 4 points in game 3 and just 2 points in the decisive game 5, which Panathinaikos lost 45-44. This was evident during the 1995 EuroBasket held in Athens, when fans of both clubs jeered him, although a huge chunk of their dissatisfaction could be attributed to Paspalj being the captain of the powerhouse Yugoslav squad that just ended Greek hopes of winning the title on home soil in an emotionally charged semi-final. Lifting that trophy in front of the Athens crowd served as huge vindication and confidence boost for Paspalj after a couple of tough seasons, and the release of tension was evident in his jubilant locker-room interview with Vassilis Skountis when Paspalj ebulliently joined in with the chant (meant ironically in this instance as he was clutching the trophy in his arms) that \\"You will never lift the Cup, Paspalj, Paspalj!\\" =Panionios= Paspalj moved on in late summer of 1995 and after rumors of a move to Real Madrid proved unfounded, began the new season with Panionios Afisorama, also of Athens (Nea Smyrni). This was a smaller club that had regularly over-achieved, and it had the good fortune of being led by the great Du≈°an Ivkoviƒá who knew Paspalj well from coaching him in the national team. Ivkovic became a father-figure to Paspalj and improved his self-confidence and his general game, and Paspalj inspired Panionios to third place in the league with a series of fine performances indicating that after two lean years he was nearing his peak once more. In just the second game of the season, Paspalj missed all eight two- point shots against Peristeri but still finished with 13 points, from 10/13 free throws and one three-pointer, indicating that his shot gradually was returning. In one performance against Sporting he scored 42 points (11/16, 14/19, 1/2), his highest since his second year at Olympiacos, while in a FIBA Koraƒá Cup match against Borovica Ruma he hit 36 on 8/9 free throws and 14/18 two-point attempts. Throughout the season his shooting became more confident and he gradually regained his ability to hit outside shots. This culminated in a match against Irakleio in 1996, when despite missing his first free-throw attempt he hit the next 15, something that would have been routine in 1991 and 1992 but unthinkable in 1994 and 1995. This was evident in both the semi-final of the A1 Playoffs, when he nearly led his team past Panathinaikos ending the three game series with 100% shooting from the free-throw line (4/4, 3/3, and 4/4), and in the 3rd place playoff, when he led Panionios to a 3-0 sweep of PAOK with 27, 26 and 17 points. =1996‚Äì97 season= Aborted move to Atlanta Hawks Paspalj had a very eventful summer in 1996. The rediscovered confidence and form became evident at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, when 30-year-old Paspalj scored 16 points in the first half of the final against the Dream Team as Yugoslavia only trailed 38-43 at halftime. He faded in the second half along with entire Yugoslavia team, but still ended up a top scorer with 19 points, leaving a good impression that prompted Atlanta Hawks to invite him to pre-season training camp in September. This came after Paspalj very nearly rejoined Olympiacos, now managed by his former Panionios mentor Ivkoviƒá ‚Äì a move that would have delighted most fans of the Piraeus club, who still retained tremendous affection for Paspalj's achievement in raising the club into the powerhouse of Europe, despite his subsequent move to Panathinaikos. His stay in Atlanta, however, was even shorter than his tenure with the Spurs. A week into camp, he relinquished the guaranteed clause in his contract and returned to Europe because of family problems. The return to the NBA thus fell through and it was soon discovered that the reason for his abrupt return home were the revelations of an extramarital affair with a woman in Athens. Paspalj considered giving up basketball in the autumn of 1996 and took a break from the sport for several months to give his body a chance to recover from years of non-stop wear and tear. Racing Paris Paspalj would end up signing with Racing Paris, joining the squad featuring French national team regulars St√©phane Risacher and Richard Dacoury, former NBA players J. R. Reid and Sedale Threatt as well as Paspalj's old Yugoslav national teammate Jure Zdovc. Paspalj spent the 1996‚Äì97 season in Paris, leading the club to its first national title in 43 years. During this period, he averaged 12 points per game and shot over 80 percent from the free throw line, indicating that his shooting confidence was returning. =Back to Greece: Aris= Paspalj returned to Greece, his second home, for the 1997‚Äì98 season and signed for Aris. This grand old club throughout the 1980s, had fallen on hard times, and was about to embark on one of the most difficult seasons of its history. His return to the A1 League was marked by an excellent performance against Larissa, scoring 23 points on 5/6, 6/13, 2/3, suggesting that Paspalj had regained his shooting confidence. Paspalj's free throw shooting, in particular, was more consistent than at any time since the dramatic deterioration of his statistics in 1994. Paspalj had some memorable performances in the autumn of 1997, including 18 points (6/6, 6/9) in a 63-56 home victory over Panathinaikos, and a game against PAOK when he steered Aris to victory with 20 points (2/2, 9/11) in the first round and another stellar performance in the second round of the championship. He also played particularly well against his old clubs, Olympiacos and Panathinaikos, and began scoring once again with three-point shots as in his heyday in the early 1990s. Two three-pointers against PAOK in the return game, which Aris also won, proved the point, as Paspalj dominated his young compatriot, Peja Stojakoviƒá, who was about to leave Greece for a stellar career in the NBA. Against Olympiacos, at a time when Aris was in economic crisis and many of its players had left the club, Paspalj top-scored 23 points (with 11/15 free throws) as he steered the team to a memorable 82-76 victory. He scored a season-high 26 points in a Koraƒá Cup game early in December 1997. In February 1998 Paspalj, playing injured, led his team to victory in the Greek Cup, scoring 12 points (2/5, 5/10) but the majority of his teammates left the club the following day after having gone without payment for some time. Paspalj remained, but an injury meant that he did not play again that season after mid-February as Aris alarmingly dropped down the table and narrowly avoided relegation to the A2 league. His final performance in the Greek League for Aris came in a 101-59 point humbling at Peristeri when he finished with 4 points and in his last game for the club (in the Koraƒá Cup) he ended with 18 points (8/10, 4/10, 0/4) in a defeat in Rome. =One last professional stint in Bologna= In the summer of 1998 Paspalj secured a move to the newly crowned European champions, Kinder Bologna, allegedly as a favour to Predrag Daniloviƒá, Paspalj's great friend and a star on the team. However, effects of past injuries and years of chain-smoking caught up with him and he was cut from the team in December on medical advice from his doctor and after a series of undistinguished performances and an average of 8.2 points per game and 4 rebounds per game in domestic play. During this period he had one final appearance in front of his old Olympiacos fans, in a EuroLeague game in October 1998, scoring 2 points (0/2 1/5), but by this time Paspalj was a shadow of his former self and struggled to keep up with the pace of games. The tragedy for basketball was that a player of his caliber was unable to continue to perform at a professional level and was lost to the sport at the age of 32, but for Paspalj himself a personal near-tragedy was still to come. Summing up his 14 and a half seasons in professional basketball, Paspalj is remembered for a successful globetrotting career that included a multitude of trophies and individual awards. Perhaps the single most memorable aspect of his game is the off-balance, unorthodox sling-style shooting technique he perfected ‚Äî a move that served him so well in the first part of his career, but deserted him later on. An interview with Paspalj in November 2015 for a Greek television station elicited a deluge of messages from viewers who continued to recall Paspalj with tremendous affection two decades later. Paspalj returned to Piraeus and his old Olympiakos home in September 2017 to attend a benefit game in honor of the legendary Yugoslav coach Dusan Ikvovic, and received a rapturous welcome from fans of his former club. National team career =Youth= Talented Paspalj, playing in Buduƒánost's youth categories at the time, got his first taste of the Yugoslav national team system as a 17-year- old when in summer 1983 he got picked by head coach Rusmir Haliloviƒá to represent his country at the European Championship for Cadets in the West German towns of T√ºbingen and Ludwigsburg. Being on a squad alongside fellow youngsters such as Jure Zdovc, Bane Preleviƒá, Miroslav Pecarski, Ivo Nakiƒá, and Luka Paviƒáeviƒá, Paspalj had a solid tournament, recording 14.6 points per game, just behind the team's leading scorer Ivica Mavrenski (18.4 ppg). Yugoslavia went on to win the title, beating Greece in the semifinal and Spain (led by Antonio Mart√≠n, Aitor Gonz√°lez de Zarate, and Rafa Jofresa) in the final. A year later, 18-year-old Paspalj was picked again by Haliloviƒá, this time for the 1984 European Championship for Juniors in Huskvarna and Katrineholm, Sweden. Playing on a team alongside old national cadet teammates Mavrenski, Paviƒáeviƒá, Zdovc, Nakiƒá, and Pecarski as well as new teammates Zoran Jovanoviƒá, Velimir Perasoviƒá, Mirko Miliƒáeviƒá, Franjo Arapoviƒá, and Ivica ≈Ωuriƒá, Paspalj starred again. The team won bronze by beating Spain after losing the semifinal versus the Soviet Union by 19 points. Achievements =Club level= Partizan FIBA Koraƒá Cup (1): 1988‚Äì89 * Yugoslav League (1): 1986‚Äì87 * Yugoslav Cup (1): 1988‚Äì89 Olympiacos Greek League (2): 1992‚Äì93, 1993‚Äì94 * Greek Cup (1): 1993‚Äì94 Racing Paris French League (1): 1996‚Äì97 Aris Greek Cup (1): 1997‚Äì98 Paspalj also participated in EuroLeague Final Fours on three occasions with three different teams. In 1988 he was part of the young Partizan squad that came in third. In 1994, he led Olympiacos to the final but couldn't make the last step. The very next season (1995) he was there again, this time with Panathinaikos, but they finished third. =National team level=EuroBasket 1989: *1990 FIBA World Championship: *EuroBasket 1991: *EuroBasket 1995: In addition, Paspalj won two Olympic silver medals (in 1988 Summer Olympics, and 1996 Summer Olympics), as well as a bronze at EuroBasket 1987. Post-playing =Health issues= In March 2001, Paspalj, just shy of his 35th birthday, suffered a mild heart attack while playing recreational football with friends in Athens. Not realizing what had happened, he went back to his Glyfada home where, while showering after football, he reportedly started feeling severe fatigue along with strong burning sensation in his lungs at which point he called a doctor. Once at the hospital, his heart attack was diagnosed and he remained hospitalized for about a week at Athens' Asklipieio General Hospital of Voula where he got advised to fundamentally change his lifestyle, including stopping smoking and reducing sports-related physical activity to a minimum. By own admission, Paspalj completely ignored the doctor's advice, soon suffering another heart attack, this time a more serious one, while playing tennis several months later in July 2001. One year after that, during summer 2002, he experienced two more similar episodes that required hospitalization and stints in intensive care ‚Äî first in June 2002 in Athens and then two months later on 18 August 2002 in Belgrade while playing outdoor pickup basketball with friends who reacted quickly and got him to a hospital where he got placed in intensive care at the cardiology unit of Belgrade's Urgentni centar. In October 2005, during a discussion on RTS television's Kljuƒç programme regarding coronary issues,SRƒåANI UDAR ‚Äì GENOCID NAD SRBIMA he stated that two heart attacks weren't enough to force him into quitting smoking or into substantially changing his lifestyle. In a November 2007 interview on the same television (Balkanskom ulicom programme) he admitted to still smoking, though adding he cut back on it significantly and is in the process of phasing it out completely. In November 2017, Paspalj was reported to have suffered a stroke while visiting San Antonio. After spending some time in hospital, Paspalj moved to the home of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, where he was visited by his former teammate Vlade Divac, who reported that the worst had passed but that Paspalj was only beginning to communicate again. =Role on the Serbia-Montenegro bench= In the early 2004 he became team manager for the Serbia-Montenegro national squad, working under head coach ≈Ωeljko Obradoviƒá who had just come back to the national team following a four-year absence. The most important aspect of Paspalj's job was helping create the right atmosphere by acting as a liaison between the head coach and the players. The thinking was that such a well-liked former player would have a soothing effect on the damaged inter-squad relations. Paspalj was also entrusted with the role of convincing different players, especially ones from the NBA, to come play for the national team. Unfortunately, his time at the post coincided with two of the team's worst performances in recent history as S&M; finished 11th (out of 12 squads) at the 2004 Athens Olympics and then failed to reach the quarter-finals of the 2005 European Championships held on home soil in Serbia. He resigned after the second failure, citing health reasons and a desire to spend more time with his wife and daughters. =Business ventures= Paspalj also decided to try his hand at business by investing heavily in the ambitious Aqua Park project in New Belgrade's Blok 44. The construction started in fall 2005. Initial projection of a summer 2006 opening turned out to be too optimistic, so, according to Paspalj, the new target for grand opening moved to the summer of 2007, however even that wasn't to be. He eventually pulled out of the venture in December 2007, which is when the project was taken over by Novi Sad based Genel company.\\"Akva park\\" od maja;Press =Serbian Olympic Committee= In February 2009, after Vlade Divac won the presidency of the Serbian Olympic Committee, he appointed Paspalj to be his second in command.NEMA LEBA OD ƒÜUTANJA, Kurir, June 6, 2009 See alsoList of Serbian NBA players ReferencesS Milkom zauvek, Ilustrovana Politika (issue# 2336), October 25, 2003 *\\"Paspalj: Akva park sigurno 2007!\\", Press, May 30, 2006 External linksBASKET ARIS Unofficial fans site dedicated to ARIS B.C. *nba.com/historical/playerfile 1966 births Living people Aris B.C. players Basketball players at the 1988 Summer Olympics Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics FIBA EuroBasket-winning players FIBA World Championship-winning players Greek Basket League players KK Buduƒánost players KK Partizan players Medalists at the 1988 Summer Olympics Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics National Basketball Association players from Serbia Olympiacos B.C. players Olympic basketball players of Yugoslavia Olympic medalists in basketball Olympic silver medalists for Yugoslavia Olympic silver medalists for Serbia and Montenegro Panathinaikos B.C. players Panionios B.C. players Paris Racing Basket players Sportspeople from Pljevlja Power forwards (basketball) San Antonio Spurs players Serbian men's basketball players Serbian expatriate basketball people in the United States Serbian expatriate basketball people in Greece Serbian expatriate basketball people in France Serbian expatriate basketball people in Italy Serbs of Montenegro Small forwards Undrafted National Basketball Association players Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna players Yugoslav men's basketball players Yugoslav expatriates in the United States 1990 FIBA World Championship players ","title":"≈Ωarko Paspalj"},{"id":"1844442","title":"Forum for Democracy and Development"},{"id":"1844443","text":"Animation of the expansion of China, from its heartland in the Yangtze and Yellow River valleys, to dominating most of East Asia. Over the last four thousand years, Chinese imperialism has been a central feature of the history of East Asia. Since the recovery of Chinese strength in the late 20th century, the issues involved have been of concern to China's neighbors to the east. Early Chinese expansions Qin dynasty at its extent in 210 B.C. The Qin dynasty marked the beginning of Chinese expansionism. Han dynasty at its extent. Tang dynasty in 660. Territories of the Qing dynasty in 1820. Republic of China in 1936. Map of modern China. =Early Chinese expansion= Beginning of Chinese expansionism Historically, China has been a major empire in history, and throughout its history, China developed from a relatively small nation in the northern basin of the Huaxia, which is believed to be between modern Yellow and Yangtze rivers, slowly became a major power from ancient era. To achieve that, various ethnic Han Chinese dynasties had perpetuated the expansions of the nation, until it was unified under the Qin dynasty. However, it was only the Qin dynasty that China truly started its process of expansion into other nations. Qin dynasty's expansionism eventually led to its first contacts with the ancient Viet tribes, and further extended to ancient Koreans, as well as the Xiongnus. The Qin dynasty also set up the milestone for future Imperial expansions of China. The Han dynasty marked the height of early Chinese expansionism. Under the Han dynasty, China managed to conquer northern Korea and northern Vietnam, annexing several parts of these territories in the process. The Han dynasty also managed to expel several nomad tribes and gained control, for sometimes, over what would be modern Xinjiang, though it was mostly symbolic due to unsuitable climate situation and internal turmoil within. Following the fall of the Han dynasty, Korea was set free of China, leaving only northern Vietnam remained under Chinese control, and the Three Kingdoms era temporarily halted Chinese expansionism. Nonetheless, the Cao Wei, Shu Han and Eastern Wu managed to extend its territorial gains in some parts under their territorial control. Once the Three Kingdoms ended and establishment of the Jin dynasty, Chinese expansionism stopped becoming the main headline for four centuries, as China was in dire need to consolidate back its borderland following its significant population losses. The Sui dynasty, which reunified China after another 350 years of divisions, attempted to embark back on expansionism, but four disastrous campaigns to Korea put the dynasty to its end. Tang dynasty The establishment of the Tang dynasty marked the comeback of Chinese expansionism, where it was also considered as the height of China as an ancient superpower. Under the Tang dynasty, China managed to maintain control over northern Vietnam, and returned to Korea. The Chinese Empire also managed to extend its control over Xinjiang and Central Asia, through it was mostly symbolic like the Han attempt earlier, as China sought to buy loyalty from the Turkic and Sogdian tribes. At least, for once, the Chinese Empire managed to enroach into the Tibetan territory and occupied Lhasa, until they had to abandon due to difficult climate. The Tang Chinese expansion was checked following the Battle of Talas in modern-day Kyrgyzstan, when the Chinese Empire was defeated by the Arabs. However, China remained strong enough to process a significant weight until the An Lushan Rebellion that led China to be completely crippled. The weakening of Chinese Empire partly traced from the rebellion, and thus, it weakened the expansion process of China to an insignificant level, as China could not deal with repeated raids and invasions from the Uyghurs and Turkic nomads, as well as the Tibetans; losing territories to both of them as well. This was just the slow process of other territorial losses China suffered in the aftermath of the rebellion. Civil War and Song dynasty When the Tang dynasty collapsed, China entered the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, and as for the consequence of the repeated instability, the Vietnamese eventually set free from China in 938, delivered a devastating blow to Chinese expansionism. At the same time, the divisions of China once again ended with the Song dynasty proclaimed, and soon the Song dynasty sought to revive expansionism, and launched an invasion to northern Vietnam in process, but was repelled by L√™ Ho√†n. From then, Song China had struggled to reconsolidate back the borderland and inner territories, as well as repeated wars with Vietnam, Jurchens and the Tanguts.https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33088188/5.Alexander%20Kim.pdf?sequence=1 This had prevented China from ever taking any serious military expeditions, and this would stay so until the rise of the Mongols from modern-day Mongolia which led to the collapse of the Song dynasty. =Medieval Chinese expansion= From the Mongols to the Ming The Mongol Empire conquered entire of China, where they proclaimed the Yuan dynasty in Chinese heartland. The Mongol Empire was marked with the embracing of Sino-Mongol expansionism, as China, now under Mongol rule, began the process of conquering other territories. The Mongol Yuan dynasty launched two Mongol invasions of Burma, with the First Mongol invasion of Burma delivered a devastating blow to the Pagan Kingdom and effectively left it collapsed. On the same time, the Yuan Empire also managed to conquer Korea though it was very costly. The Mongols also had great success in conquering Tibet, thus incorporating Tibet into Chinese territory for the first time in the history, albeit under Mongol and not Chinese jurisdiction.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290817649_The_Mongol_conquest_of_Tibet However, the Mongols had been extremely unsuccessful in its attempt to conquer Vietnam and India, and disastrous naval expedition attempts to invade Java and Japan, which led to the end of Sino-Mongol expansionist desires. Following the collapse of Mongol Yuan dynasty and Mongolian retreat, the newly-established Ming dynasty was initially reluctant to embark on expansionism due to destruction left back by the Mongols. The first Ming Emperor, Hongwu, was openly against expansionism and insisted only on a pacifist approach. He specifically warned future Emperors only to defend against foreign barbarians, and not engage in military campaigns for glory and conquest. However, once Hongwu died, the reign of Yongle saw China attempted to return to expansionism, by launching an invasion to Vietnam, eventually leading to the fourth Chinese domination. However, the old warning by Hongwu turned to be a prediction, as Vietnam proved to be a bone on China's expansionism, eventually led to its eventual defeat in the Battle of T·ªët ƒê·ªông ‚Äì Ch√∫c ƒê·ªông and the collapse of Chinese rule 20 years later. Following the failure to re-annex Vietnam into China, the Ming dynasty started to concentrate only in internal affairs, and refused to make further interventions or expeditions, except for naval expeditions and trades. Qing dynasty The Qing dynasty was a Manchu-based dynasty, descended from the Jurchens which founded the Jin dynasty earlier. However, after founding the dynasty in mainland China, it was also Sinicized in process, and embraced Chinese expansionism as well. By the late 19th century, in response to competition with other states, the Qing government of China attempted to exert direct control of its frontier areas by conquest or, if already under military control, conversion into provinces. The ability of Qing China to project power into Central Asia came about because of two changes, one social and one technological. The social change was that under the Qing dynasty, from 1642, China came under the control of the Manchus who organised their military forces around cavalry which was more suited for power projection than traditional Chinese infantry. The technological change was advances in artillery which negated the military advantage that the people of the Steppe had with their cavalry. Zunghar Khanate (–ó“Ø“Ø–Ω –≥–∞—Ä—ã–Ω —Ö–∞–∞–Ω—Ç —É–ª—Å) was the last great independent nomadic power on the steppe in Central Asia. The Dzungars were deliberately exterminated in a brutal campaign during the Zunghar Genocide by Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols. It has been estimated that more than a million people were slaughtered, and it took generations for it to recover. The Manchu ruling family (Aisin Gioro) was a supporter of Tibetan Buddhism and so many of the ruling groups were linked by religion. The Qing dynasty was seen to be the return of Chinese expansionist policies. Under the Qing rule, China expanded beyond the Great Wall and started to annex more territories in process. The Qing invaded Korea, managed to conquer Mongolia, and also annexed modern territories of Xinjiang and Tibet as well.http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/repository/81009892.pdf The Qing also managed to extend its control into Central Asia for once more, mostly concentrated in what would be today Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The Qing also destroyed the Kingdom of Tungning of Koxinga, and annexed Taiwan as well. This marked for the first time, China managed to directly control Xinjiang, Taiwan, Tibet, Central Asia and Mongolia. China also marked its claims far to Sakhalin, even though the Qing didn't manage to control it; or even to Kashmir where it fought a bitter war against the Sikhs. Ming-dynasty loyalists from China invaded Taiwan and expelled Dutch colonialists from the island during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia and founded the Chinese Kingdom of Tungning. The Ming loyalists quickly moved to replace the institutions and culture of Dutch colonial rule with Han Chinese colonial rule. Language and religious institutions left by the Dutch were closed and replaced with Confucian temples and Chinese language schools for both Han Chinese and aboriginals. Officials encouraged new immigration of Han Chinese from China into territory further inland, turning aboriginal lands into new farmland.Wills J. Jr (2006), \\"The Seventeenth Century Transformation\\", in Taiwan: A New History, Rubinstein, M. ed., M. E. Sharpe. . After fighting between the Ming loyalists and the Qing during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, the Qing attacked the Kingdom of Tungning. the Qing won the Battle of Penghu and the Ming loyalists submitted to Qing rule. Tungning was annexed as part of Fujian province. The Qing were \\"reluctant colonizers\\" but became convinced of Taiwan's value to their empire due to the threat the island posed if used as a base by rival powers, and by its abundant resources. The Qing turned Taiwan into its own province in 1885, after Japanese interest and a defeated French invasion attempt. After British troops invaded Tibet in the waning days of the Qing dynasty, the Qing responded by sending Zhao Erfeng to further integrate Tibet into China. He succeeded in abolishing the powers of the Tibetan local leaders in Kham and appointing Chinese magistrates in their places by 1909‚Äì10. Qing forces were also sent to √ú-Tsang in 1910 to establish a direct control over Tibet proper, though a province was never established in this area. The Qing campaign against Burma (Myanmar) (1765‚Äì70) was its most disastrous and costly frontier war. It ended in a military defeat but the Qing rulers could not accept Burma as an equal, and when diplomatic relations were resumed in 1790, the Qing court considered it a restoration of Chinese suzerainty. =Early modern Chinese expansion= Republic of China When the Qing collapsed at 1911, the newly-established Republic of China found itself in dire need situation to protect its newly-acquired border; Tibet utilized by declaring independence, which was not recognized by the Republic of China. Therefore, the Republic of China had sought to consolidate control of its territory and refused to embrace expansionist policy. The Republic of China, however, faced numerous pressure from Japan in 1915, with the Twenty-One Demands caused public uproars.https://www.firstworldwar.com/source/21demands.htm It also faced strong opposition from the later-established Soviet Union, which also sought to take advantage from Russian expansionist policy, leading to the border conflict of 1929. The Soviets and Japanese meddling into Chinese affairs and the lack of compromises from Western leaders over Japanese and Russian expansionism made the work difficult, as Russia had interests with regard to Xinjiang, and Japanese invasion in northeast China at 1931.https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1338326445&disposition;=inline On the same time, the Chinese Civil War also prevented any attempts of a possible Chinese expansion. When the World War II broke out, nonetheless Chiang Kai-shek had sought to restore Chinese influence. Being a major ally among the Big Four, Chiang wanted to restore Chinese influence in Korea and Southeast Asia, in a vision for a new Asia under Chiang's command. Once the World War II ended, Chiang Kai-shek started trying to implement the project, by sending troops to occupy northern Vietnam. Yet, as the Chinese Civil War resumed, it had dented Chiang's desire, and he had to retreat most of his army to fight against the now-stronger communist force. Eventually, the Republic lost and the expansionist policy was transferred from the fallen Republic to the communists, which Mao would proclaim as the modern People's Republic of China. People's Republic of China Following the de facto end of the Chinese Civil War, Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China, and, at the first stage, styled his rule after Joseph Stalin. China temporarily abandoned the irredentist idea in order to focus on internationalism promoted by the communist world. Thus, the early PRC saw China fought in Korean War and Vietnam War, both to help the communist North Korea and North Vietnam. However, this didn't mean China had given up the idea of expansionism. China started to reconquer Xinjiang, absorbing the then- Second East Turkestan Republic with help from Stalin, before conquering Tibet at 1950 and crushed a later uprising in blood. Following Dalai Lama's escape to India, China and India fought a bitter border war at 1962, where China gained Aksai Chin and stampeded into Arunachal Pradesh (called South Tibet in China), before retreating from the latter over increasing turmoils. Before that, China also sought to takeover Taiwan, then under the authority of the rivalling Republic of China, causing the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, but was unsuccessful due to American threat in response. China also sought to take over Sikkim in 1967, but it was unsuccessful. A Chinese map published in 1961 showed China claiming territories in Bhutan, Nepal and the Kingdom of Sikkim (now a state of India). Incursions by Chinese soldiers and Tibetan herdsmen allying with Chinese government also provoked tensions in Bhutan. Imposing a cross-border trade embargo and closing the border, Bhutan established extensive military ties with India. After these conflicts, the Cultural Revolution initiated by Mao Zedong had halted Chinese expansionism as China suffered heavy devastation following the revolution. Once the Cultural Revolution ended, China started to embrace back expansionism. In 1974, China launched its first naval expedition to invade Paracel Islands and defeated the 50-strong South Vietnamese garrison. The event was the first sign of returning Chinese expansionism in China. Tensions triggered between China and later unified communist Vietnam led to the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979. Although this was a short war, it is still seen as a sign of Chinese expansionism in Vietnam. China and Vietnam later fought another bitter smirkmish in South China Sea at 1988, resulting in China's consolidation of some occupied islands. Modern Chinese expansionism Since the Chinese economic reform of 1978, China has managed to transform into a new economic, military and political superpower. In process, China has also expanded greatly its economy, and since 2010, is the second largest economy in the world. As China transformed, there have been hopes that China would give up its expansionist idea. However, since the rise of Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping in power, and increasing territorial conflicts which China stated most of their disputed lands belong to China, it is widely known that China has continued to adhere to irredentism to even today. =People's Republic of China territorial expansion=  Annexation of Tibet  The annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China (called the \\"Peaceful Liberation of Tibet\\" by the Chinese government and the \\"Chinese invasion of Tibet\\" by the Tibetan Government in Exile) were the series of events from 1950 to 1959 by which the People's Republic of China (PRC) gained control of Tibet. These regions came under the control of China after attempts by the Government of Tibet to gain international recognition, efforts to modernize its military, negotiations between the Government of Tibet and the PRC, a military conflict in the Chamdo area of western Kham in October 1950, and the eventual acceptance of the Seventeen Point Agreement by the Government of Tibet under Chinese pressure in October 1951. In some Western opinions, the incorporation of Tibet into China is viewed as an annexation. The Government of Tibet remained in place in the under the authority of China until the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when the Dalai Lama was forced to flee into exile in India and after which the Government of Tibet and Tibetan social structures were dissolved.Goldstein 1997 p.54,55. Feigon 1996 p.160,161. Shakya 1999 p.208,240,241. (all sources: fled Tibet, repudiated agreement, dissolved local government).  Five Fingers of Tibet  Five Fingers of Tibet is the Chinese strategy originally propounded by Mao Zedong to annex Ladakh (India), Nepal, Sikkim (India), Bhutan, and Arunachal Pradesh (India). According to the Five Fingers of Tibet strategy, Tibet is considered as China's right hand palm, with five fingers on its periphery: Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh, with the ultimate objective to assert China's claim and authority over these regions.  East China Sea Disputes  With the 1978 Chinese economic reform launched by Deng Xiaoping, China has increased its political stance, its influence and its power abroad. On one side, China remains deeply neutral and not involving itself in any conflict, and the land borders are stable. China has increased its influence, while using military and economic wealth and claims to island territories that have caused anxiety in neighbors to the east, such as the Philippines and Japan.  South China Sea Disputes  The South China Sea disputes involve both island and maritime claims of China over several neighboring sovereign states in the region, namely Brunei, the Republic of China (ROC/Taiwan), Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The disputes are over islands, reefs, banks, and other features in the South China Sea, including the Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, Scarborough Shoal, boundaries in the Gulf of Tonkin and the waters near the Indonesian Natuna Islands.  Belt and Road Initiative  Jeffrey Reeves (2018) argues that since 2012, Xi Jinping has demonstrated \\"a concerted imperialist policy\\" towards its developing neighbor states to the south and west, especially Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Chinese overseas populations are also said to play a disproportionate role in Southeast Asian economies in what is referred to as the bamboo network.

A freeze helps move the project forward towards a release or the end of an iteration by reducing the scale or frequency of changes, and may be used to help meet a roadmap. The exact rules depend on the type of freeze and the particular development process in use; for example, they may include only allowing changes which fix bugs, or allowing changes only after thorough review by other members of the development team. They may also specify what happens if a change contrary to the rules is required, such as restarting the freeze period. https://softwarestreets.com/ Common types of freezes are: * A (complete) specification freeze, in which the parties involved decide not to add any new requirement, specification, or feature to the feature list of a software project, so as to begin coding work. * A (complete) feature freeze, in which all work on adding new features is suspended, shifting the effort towards fixing bugs and improving the user experience. The addition of new features may have a disruptive effect on other parts of the program, due both to the introduction of new, untested source code or resources and to interactions with other features; thus, a feature freeze helps improve the program's stability. For example: \\"user interface feature freeze\\" means no more features will be permitted to the user interface portion of the code; bugs can still be fixed. * A (complete) code freeze, in which no changes whatsoever are permitted to a portion or the entirety of the program's source code. Particularly in large software systems, any change to the source code may have unintended consequences, potentially introducing new bugs; thus, a code freeze helps ensure that a portion of the program that is known to work correctly will continue to do so. Code freezes are often employed in the final stages of development, when a particular release or iteration is being tested, but may also be used to prevent changes to one portion of a program while another is undergoing development. For example: \\"physics freeze\\" means no changes whatsoever will be permitted to the physics portion of the code.  Implementations  In development environments using version control, the use of branching can alleviate delays in development caused by freezes. For example, a project may have a \\"stable\\" branch from which new versions of the software are released, and a separate \\"development\\" branch in which the developers add new code. The effect of a freeze is then to prevent promotion of some or all changes from the development branch to the stable branch. In other words, the freeze applies only to the stable branch, and developers can continue their work on the development branch.

They can be found in various locations, including China, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In China, they are known in Mandarin as xuanguan () which also means \\"hanging coffin\\". China One of the hanging tombs (example of an exposed natural site) of the Ku People at Bainitang (ÁôΩÊ≥•Â°ò), Qiubei county, Wenshan prefecture, Yunnan province, China. Hanging coffins are an ancient funeral custom of some ethnic groups, especially the Bo people of southern China. Coffins of various shapes were mostly carved from one whole piece of wood. Hanging coffins either lie on beams projecting outward from vertical faces such as mountains, are placed in caves in the face of cliffs, or sit on natural rock projections on mountain faces. According to Chinaculture.org it was said that the hanging coffins could prevent bodies from being taken by beasts and also bless the soul eternally. Spiritually, the Bo people viewed the mountain cliffs as a stairway to heaven and believed that by placing the coffins up high the deceased would be closer to heaven. A practical reason for placing the coffins on cliffs includes isolation, so that they are hard for animals to reach and less vulnerable to destruction.

Though the party aims to represent all minorities of South Africa, its support comes mainly from South Africa's Indian community. Its largest base of political strength is in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, especially the city of Durban which is the cultural and demographic centre of South Africa's Indian community. It was led by Amichand Rajbansi until his death in December 2011. History It was formed as a successor to the National People's Party, which was an important party led by Rajbansi in the Indian-only House of Delegates in the Tricameral Parliament. After his death, Rajbansi's widow, Shameen Thakur-Rajbansi, was appointed as leader in January 2012. A leadership and family battle erupted when an attempt was made to replace Thakur-Rajbansi as leader, with Amichand Rajbansi's son, Vimal, and first wife, Asha Devi Rajbansi, asking her to step down, and a breakaway conference (not recognized by the IEC) elected Roy Bhoola, who Thakur-Rajbansi had attempted to remove from public office. Thakur-Rajbansi was declared the undisputed leader in December 2013 after the parties settled their disputes in a confidential agreement.  Election results  = National elections = - ! Election !

The brig played an important role with the American squadron on Lake Erie, and was sold at the end of the war. Caledonia was the first warship in the U.S. Navy to carry that name. Capture of Caledonia Caledonia was built for the Canadian North West Company at Malden, near Amherstburg in Upper Canada in 1807, for the North American fur trade on the Great Lakes. In 1812, the brig was taken into military service with the Provincial Marine, a naval transport and protection service in Canada. It played a major part in the Battle of Mackinac Island, transporting artillery which was used to force the American garrison of the island to surrender. After the American garrison of Detroit surrendered after the Siege of Detroit, Caledonia and the brig , which had been captured at Detroit, were engaged in transporting troops and stores from Detroit and Amherstburg to the Niagara River, where an American attack was anticipated. On 8 October 1812, the two brigs were anchored near Fort Erie at the head of the Niagara River. Caledonia carried two 4-pounder guns on pivots, and had a crew of twelve. There were also ten American prisoners aboard, and a cargo of furs worth approximately $200,000, a considerable sum of money at the time. A boarding party consisting of American sailors under Lieutenant Jesse D. Elliott and soldiers under Captain Nathan Towson boarded and captured both brigs. Adams ran aground under artillery fire on an island in the river and was eventually set on fire to prevent it being recaptured. Caledonia was taken successfully to the navy yard at Black Rock, New York. During the boarding one American sailor was killed and four seriously wounded by a volley of musketry. The twelve Canadian crew members were made captive. Service in the War of 1812 The U.S. Navy formally purchased Caledonia on 6 February 1813, and armed the vessel with two long 24-pounder guns and one 32-pounder carronade. This gave Caledonia a broadside of 80 pounds of shot. For several months, British batteries on the other side of the Niagara prevented Caledonia and several other schooners which had been purchased by the Navy and were converted into gunboats from leaving Black Rock. On 26 May, the British were defeated at the Battle of Fort George at the foot of the river and were compelled to abandon Fort Erie and the nearby batteries. Lieutenant Oliver Hazard Perry had Caledonia and the other vessels towed by oxen up the fast- flowing river, an operation that took several days. He then sailed with them along the southern shore of Lake Erie to Presque Isle, where the other vessels of his squadron were being constructed. On 10 September, Caledonia played a key role in the decisive Battle of Lake Erie. Caledonia was commanded in this battle by Lieutenant Daniel Turner, who was praised by Perry for his conduct. For much of the early part of the battle, the other major American vessels were outranged, and only Caledonias long guns could engage the British flagship and the other British vessels at the center of the battle. Following the American victory, Caledonia transported American troops to Detroit and Amherstburg, which had been abandoned by the British Army. In 1814, Caledonia was part of the expedition to Lake Huron, which attempted to recover Mackinac Island. Post-war disposition The brig was sold at Presque Isle in May, 1815. Refitted as a commercial ship, she was named General Wayne, and reportedly sank in the 1830s in Lake Erie. However, a 1934 article in the Canadian history magazine \\"The Beaver\\" claimed the ship did not sink, but was dismantled in Erie, Pennsylvania. On 24 July 2009, a story appearing in the Buffalo News mentioned the discovery of an 85-foot schooner on the bottom of Lake Erie, which may be Caledonia. The American company Northeast Research Ltd proposed raising the well preserved wreck and putting it on display near Buffalo, New York. In May 2010 a New York magistrate ruled that this would violate New York's \\"in situ preservation\\" policy of leaving shipwrecks intact, and where they are found. The decision has been appealed, and in September 2010 the case is being heard by U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara.

It tells of the semi- tragic descent of its young protagonist Anna Morgan, who is moved from her Caribbean home to England by an uncaring stepmother, after the death of her father. Once she leaves school, and she is cut off financially by the stepmother, Hester, Anna tries to support herself as a chorus girl, then becomes involved with an older man named Walter who supports her financially. When he leaves her, she begins a downward spiral. Like William Faulkner's The Wild Palms, the novel features a botched illegal abortion. Rhys' original version of Voyage in the Dark ended with Anna dying from this abortion (see Bonnie Kime Scott's The Gender of Modernism for the original ending), but she revised it before publication to the more ambivalent and modernist ending in which Anna survives to return to her now-shattered life \\"all over again.\\" The novel is rich in Caribbean folklore and tradition and post-colonial identity politics, including black self-identification by its white protagonist. Plot summary =Part One= # Anna compares England to her Caribbean, where everything was colourful. By contrast, England is greyish. She dislikes England throughout the novel, always feeling like an outsider. She is always cold and describes all of the towns that she tours as part of a chorus line as identical. The book begins with Anna living in Southsea with a friend, Maudie. The two have trouble persuading a landlady to take them in, the implication being that chorus girls are 'professionals' or prostitutes. The landlady complains about the way that they walk around in their dressing gowns. Anna goes for a walk with Maudie, and they meet two men whom they take back to their flat for some tea, much to their landlady's disgust. When Anna goes to London, she agrees to meet one of the men, Walter. # Walter takes her to dinner in a restaurant with a private dining room and a bedroom attached, a place clearly meant to be used for illicit rendezvous. He is obviously wealthy. After a meal, he makes a pass at Anna, and she goes into the bedroom, shuts the door and lies down on the bed for a long time. She is nervous as she has never had sex before, but is interested in becoming sexual with Walter, but does not know how to go about it. Walter comes in and apologises and walks her to a taxi. The next day she receives some money in a letter from him, in which he apologises. She goes out to buy some clothes with the money. Back home she becomes ill and sends him a letter asking him to visit. Walter visits, buys her food and a warm coverlet for her bed, and pays a doctor to see her. # Anna visits Walter again, and when he puts his hand on her knee, says that she must go, and begins to cry. But he tells her to be brave and they end up going to bed together. She loses her virginity. # Anna is now supported as a \\"kept woman\\"; she moves to better quarters and waits all day for letters from Walter arranging meeting times. She has fallen in love with him. One day a letter arrives from Maudie, saying that she will visit soon, and they go for a walk in Hyde Park. # Anna goes to visit Walter and meets Vincent, his cousin. She tells Walter she doesn't like him and then begins to tell him about her early life in the Caribbean. They make love, and she lies awake. # Anna goes to visit her stepmother, Hester, who tells her that there is no more money for her from her father's Caribbean estate, which Hester has sold. Hester also explains that she sent a letter to Anna's Uncle Bo saying Anna would be better off in the Caribbean, but that he would need to pay half of her fare to get there. Uncle Bo's reply accuses Hester of cheating Anna out of her inheritance, which Hester denies vehemently. She argues she cannot afford to help Anna financially any longer, and that it is her uncle's responsibility. Hester states that she does not approve of Anna's uncle because he is open in his acceptance of both the black and white children in his family, and gives all the children the family's last name. Her abhorrence of miscegenation is depicted negatively in the text, as a sign of her intolerant bigotry, for her major concern is the appearance of impropriety and not the impropriety itself. Hester doesn't approve of black-white friendship at all; we learn that she got very annoyed when Anna got too close to the black servant, Francine, and eventually had her sent away. Anna's uncle, in turn, doesn't approve of Hester, accusing her of mismanaging her husband's property and failing to support Anna. # Anna is desperately afraid that Walter will get bored and leave her. One day he takes her to the country for what is at first a wonderful time. The trip is cut short, however, when Vincent and his French lover, who have joined them, fall out and decide to leave early. Walter tells Anna that the reason for the argument was because Walter is taking Vincent when he goes to the US for a while ‚Ä¶ the first time that Anna has heard of the trip. # Anna receives a letter from Vincent saying that Walter is sorry, but he is no longer in love with her. They both still want to assist her as much as possible. # Anna asks Walter to meet her, despite the fact that Vincent has said it is better that they don't see each other. She tries to get him to take her home, but he will not, so they part. Anna decides to break from him altogether, and she leaves the lodging he has paid for without leaving a forwarding address. =Part Two= # Anna sells some clothing to raise money to pay her rent. In her new accommodations, she meets a woman called Ethel who is only there, she tells Anna, while her new place is being refurnished. They go to the pictures together, and Ethel, who runs a manicure and massage business, offers Anna accommodation and a job. # One day Anna goes out and meets Laurie by chance, along with two American boyfriends of hers, Carl and Joe. They go out for drinks and get a little tipsy. # They go out again to a hotel. It is implied that Laurie is a prostitute, and Anna goes into hysterics, and throws a scene. # Anna goes and visits Ethel, and is taken up as the manicurist, even though she has no experience. =Part Three= # Anna isn't very good at her job. Ethel is obviously running a bit of a racket. Her adverts are suggestive, but not explicitly so, so that the men arrive expecting more than a massage, and when they don't get it there is nothing that they can do. One day Ethel's massage table breaks and the man on it jumps off into some hot water and injures himself. Anna doesn't show much sympathy, and Ethel becomes angry. She tells Anna that she is too moody, no good at the job, and never invites Ethel along when she goes out. It appears that Ethel had expected that Anna might prostitute herself and that Ethel expected to act as a madam, though she does not say this explicitly. She orders Anna to leave, then quickly reverses her decision and begs her to stay. Anna says that she must go for a walk, and Ethel tells her that if she is not back within an hour she will gas herself. She goes half way to Walter's place and then returns to find a very relieved Ethel. # Anna is ill. When she meets up with Laurie, one of her boyfriends, Carl Redman, asks her if she is on ether. She ends up going to sleep with him. # Ethel is inquisitive about Carl and doesn't seem to disapprove. Carl tells Anna that he is leaving the country soon; both he and Joe have wives in the States. One day Anna meets Maudie, who borrows some money. She needs to buy new clothes or else she thinks the man she is going out with won't marry her. # Anna almost ends up going to bed with a man with a broken hand. While they are dancing in her bedroom at Ethel's, Anna throws her shoe at a picture of a dog she imagines is smirking at her, shattering the glass. Soon after she has a fit of morning sickness, and when the man won't release her from his grip she hits him on his injured hand, and throws up. He leaves. # Anna is now staying with Laurie, who has received a 'peach of a letter' from Ethel, saying that Anna owes her money for destroying her room. She also mentions that Anna was bringing many men back to the apartment, which she could not stand, and also that she has become aware that Anna is pregnant. Anna and Laurie discuss the possibilities of an abortion. Anna has waited too long to seek this abortion, ambivalently wishing to keep the baby she cannot support, while also drinking concoctions that are supposed to induce abortion. # Laurie and Anna meet up with Vincent to arrange the money for the abortion. He assures her that everything will be all right, but commands Anna to return the letters between her and Walter, which she does. # Anna goes to Mrs. Robinson's and has the abortion. =Part Four= # The abortion is botched, and Anna becomes extremely ill. Anna hears Laurie talking to her new landlady, Mrs Polo about her condition. She is still unwell. She hallucinates, her mind fills with scenes of the masquerade in the Caribbean of her childhood, recent seductions, and the dark room that she is in. A doctor comes to attend her and says, \\"She'll be alright [‚Ä¶] Ready to start all over again in no time, I've no doubt.\\" The last paragraph returns to Anna's stream of consciousness narrative voice pondering repeatedly the idea of \\"all over again.\\" Thematic connections to other works The title Rhys chose for her depiction of European modernity recalls another work of modernist literature, Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (first serialized in 1899). Rhys's title turns Conrad's on its head: instead of a journey from England to the dark depths of savagery in colonial Africa, it is in England that Anna travels through darkness and despair, while the colonies created in the West Indies are depicted as places of light and innocence. London is represented as a monotonous, suffocating, and alien city, in contrast to Anna's bright, vibrant, and sensual home in Dominica. Through the character of Anna, Voyage in the Dark presents the tension between wanting to be integrated into English society and simultaneously resisting it, a trait it shares with other works of modernist literature written by Anglophone authors such as the MƒÅori writer Witi Ihimaera, whose characters express a desire to engage with and absorb the best of the colonial legacy, yet simultaneously seek to assert their own identity and to avoid becoming absorbed by the culture of the colonial power. Anna's alienation and subordination is caused not only by her heritage but also by her sex, and it is possible to read her mistreatment at the hands of men as a metaphor for rejection of traditional values. Anna is represented as being caught between worlds: finding herself isolated socially and emotionally from those around her, she is unable to comfortably reconcile her West Indian and her British heritage. The novel employs modernist techniques to represent this, merging fragments of Anna's past with the action in England by means of a dreamlike stream of interior monologue, which destabilizes and ruptures the narrative, and emphasizes Anna's detachment from English society.

Her father, Alexandre Marchant de Saint Michel, was born a French Roman Catholic but later converted to the Church of England. He married Dorothea, a daughter of Sir Francis Kingsmill, in Ireland. Elizabeth was born at or around Bideford in Devon on 23 October 1640. She died of typhoid on 10 November 1669. Elisabeth was a second cousin once removed of the writer Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea. Diary of Samuel Pepys Samuel Pepys by John Hayls, who also painted Mrs Pepys Most of what is known about Elisabeth Pepys comes from her husband's diary, which he kept between January 1660 and 31 May 1669. Their marriage and relationship are a key theme throughout. They were married on 1 December 1655 at St Margaret's, Westminster, not by a clergyman but by Richard Sherwyn, Esq., a Westminster Justice of the Peace, an arrangement for civil marriages put in place by Cromwell‚Äôs government.The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 189 (1850), p. 367 Samuel Pepys later remembered the wedding in great detail, recalling that Elisabeth had worn a petticoat trimmed with gold lace. Although the couple had a civil ceremony on 1 December 1655, they celebrated their wedding anniversary on 10 October, when a religious ceremony was held and they started to live together. Richard Ollard attributes this lapse of time to Elisabeth's youth. It is well known that Samuel himself was unfaithful to Elisabeth, often with their own maids. His best documented affair is one with the young housemaid Deb Willet, whom Pepys became particularly fond of, referring to her in the second to last line of his diary. However, it is clear that Pepys held strong feelings for his wife throughout their marriage. When they were away from each other, Samuel greatly missed Elisabeth. Although they were separated for several months shortly after marrying, this has been considered to be a result of Samuel's strong feelings of jealousy. They reunited shortly before the diary was begun and lived in Axe Yard. Samuel's changeable feelings for Elisabeth can be seen throughout his diary. A resentful sentence from 25 April 1663 suggests jealous feelings surrounding her and her dancing teacher, or perhaps a simple familiarity with Elisabeth and her self-confidence: \\"...merrily practising to dance, which my wife hath begun to learn this day of Mr. Pembleton, but I fear will hardly do any great good at it, because she is conceited that she do well already, though I think no such thing.\\"The Diary of Samuel Pepys, 25 April 1663. Memorial to Elisabeth Pepys, St Olave‚Äôs Samuel's affection towards Elisabeth can be seen prominently in letters during her severe typhoid fever and after her death, as he apologises to fellow politicians and naval captains for not attending board meetings for four weeks after the death and not keeping up to date with letters during her illness: \\"CAPTAIN ELLIOT, I beg you earnestly to believe that nothing but the sorrow and distraction I have been in by the death of my wife, increased by the suddenness with which it pleased God to surprise me therewith, after a voyage so full of health and content, could have forced me to so long a neglect of my private concernments.\\"Samuel Pepys to Captain Elliot, 3 May 1669‚Äì70 Following Elisabeth‚Äôs death, Samuel‚Äôs continuing affection towards her has been suggested through his succeeding relationship with Mary Skinner and his decision to not marry her, even though, as evidenced in his letters to John Evelyn, she acted as his wife in all but name. Similarly, when he himself died in 1703, regardless of his long-term relationship with Mary Skinner, on his own orders Pepys was laid to rest next to his wife. Memorial to Samuel Pepys, St Olave‚Äôs In popular culture In 1991, Dale Spender published a fictional literary spoof, The Diary of Elizabeth Pepys (1991 Grafton Books, London). Purportedly written by Elisabeth, the book is a feminist critique of women's lives in Restoration London.

Manley of Boston, MA. WestShore Plaza was opened in 1967 and was touted as Tampa's first shopping center that was fully air-conditioned. WestShore houses many specialty shops including Francesca's Collection, LOFT, New Balance, H&M;, Old Navy, Sunglass Hut, and more. The property is owned and managed by Washington Prime Group. The mall's anchors are JCPenney, flagship Macy's and Dick's Sporting Goods stores, and an AMC movie theater, with one vacant anchor last occupied by Sears. Restaurants include P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Grimaldi's Pizzeria, Irish 31, the Bay Area's only Maggiano's Little Italy, Seasons 52, and Mitchell's Fish Market Restaurant and there is also a kids play area near JCPenney. A nursing room can be found in the women's restroom and baby changing stations in all restrooms. History Westshore Plaza opened on September 28, 1967, as the Tampa Bay area's first enclosed shopping mall. The mall's first anchor was Maas Brothers, which actually opened a year before the rest of the mall on October 28, 1966, featuring the Suncoast Room Restaurant on the third floor. The store, which was built to complement their flagship store in downtown Tampa, became their second to be located in a shopping mall a year later (their first was at the Edison Mall in Fort Myers), and they later went on to open more mall stores on Florida's Gulf Coast. JCPenney opened on September 7, 1967, as a second anchor and only original anchor remaining today. It opened along with the first mall segment between it and Maas Brothers, which was dedicated a month later. Like Edison Mall, the center most notably included a Woolworth's five-and-dime store upon its opening, but also featured Walgreens and a Pantry Pride grocery store. The mall was expanded for the first time with a northeast wing in 1974 along with the north parking garage and a third anchor, Robinson's, who sold its Florida stores to Maison Blanche in 1987, which in turn then sold its store and six others on the West Coast of Florida to Dillard's in 1991, and this building in 2001 also in turn was snatched away by the upscale International Plaza and Bay Street a mile away. Sears took over the site after moving from Tampa Bay Center in 2002, which closed as a result and announced on December 28 that the store would be among 80 stores to shutter nationwide in March 2019. Also in 1991, Maas Brothers was acquired by Miami-based Burdines, which in turn was renamed Burdine's-Macy's in 2003, dropping the Burdine's name two years later. WestShore Plaza was acquired by the Grosvenor Group in 1990, which led to a large renovation to the mall. The mall interior was remodeled with a more Spanish-Mediterranean style interior with a three-story bell tower built over the center court. Saks Fifth Avenue opened on the west end of the mall along with a third expansion on November 12, 1998, but closed in 2013 and became a flagship Dick's Sporting Goods in 2014. In March 2014 the Palm restaurant closed after more than a dozen years in business at the WestShore Plaza.Tampa Bay Business Journal, March 17, 2014 The fourth and most recent expansion in 2000 involved relocating the food court east into the former Pantry Pride building and a new west wing of mall space with a 14-screen AMC Theatres on the second level. On June 4, 2020, JCPenney announced that it would be closing as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide.https://companyblog.jcpnewsroom.com/storeclosings/ However, the store was removed from the list on June 24, 2020 along with 17 other stores so it would be remaining open for now.https://www.tampabay.com/news/business/2020/06/24/jc-penney-takes- westshore-plaza-store-off-closing-list/ Anchors =Current=AMC WestShore 14 (opened in 2000 as part of fourth mall expansion on an upper level) *Dick's Sporting Goods (opened in 2014 in former Saks location) *JCPenney (original anchor to the mall) *Macy's (former Maas and Burdines location) =Former=Maas Brothers (became Burdines in 1991) *Burdines (became Macy's in 2005) *Robinson's (became Maison Blanche in 1987) *Maison Blanche (became Dillard's in 1991) *Dillard's (closed in 2001 and reopened as Sears in 2002) *Sears (former Robinson's, Maison Blanche, and Dillard's location, closed March 2019) *Saks Fifth Avenue (closed in 2013 and gutted and redone as Dick's Sporting Goods in 2014) References External linksWestshore Plaza Official Website *Family-Friendly Tampa Bay Buildings and structures in Tampa, Florida Shopping malls in Florida Washington Prime Group Shopping malls established in 1967 Tourist attractions in Tampa, Florida 1967 establishments in Florida ","title":"WestShore Plaza"},{"id":"1844495","text":"Stephen Booth (born April 20, 1933) is a professor emeritus of English literature at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a Marshall Scholar and studied at the University of Cambridge and Harvard University. He first attracted attention with his controversial 1969 essays On the Value of Hamlet and An Essay on Shakespeare's Sonnets, in which he reread the works in a manner considerably different from contemporary Anglo-American readings. Frank Kermode praised the former essay in the New York Review of Books in 1970 as being worth several full books of Shakespeare studies. In 1977 he published an edition with \\"analytic commentary\\" of the sonnets, again attracting both controversy and praise within the academy for his precision and bold rereadings. In 1983 followed King Lear, Macbeth, Indefinition, and Tragedy, probably his best-known work after the study of the sonnets.

On February 12, 1946, hours after being honorably discharged from the United States Army, he was attacked while still in uniform by South Carolina police as he was taking a bus home. The attack and his injuries sparked national outrage and galvanized the civil rights movement in the United States. The attack left Woodard completely and permanently blind. Due to South Carolina's reluctance to pursue the case, President Harry S. Truman ordered a federal investigation. The sheriff, Lynwood Shull, was indicted and went to trial in federal court in South Carolina, where he was acquitted by an all-white jury. Such miscarriages of justice by state governments influenced a move towards civil rights initiatives at the federal level. Truman subsequently established a national interracial commission, made a historic speech to the NAACP and the nation in June 1947 in which he described civil rights as a moral priority, submitted a civil rights bill to Congress in February 1948, and issued Executive Orders 9980 and 9981 on June 26, 1948, desegregating the armed forces and the federal government. Early life and military service Woodard was born in Fairfield County, South Carolina, and grew up in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He attended local segregated schools, often underfunded for African Americans during the Jim Crow years. On October 14, 1942, the 23-year-old Woodard enlisted in the United States Army at Fort Jackson in Columbia, South Carolina. He served in the Pacific theater in a labor battalion as a longshoreman and was promoted to sergeant.Andrew Myers, Resonant Ripples in a Global Pond: The Blinding of Isaac Woodard, \\"Honorable Discharge Paperwork\\", presented at American Humanities Conference, 2002 He earned a battle star for his Asiatic-Pacific Theater Campaign Medal by unloading ships under enemy fire in New Guinea, and received the Good Conduct Medal as well as the Service medal and World War II Victory Medal awarded to all American participants.Woodard testimony, November 1947 Part 2 He received an honorable discharge. Attack and maiming On February 12, 1946, Woodard was on a Greyhound Lines bus traveling from Camp Gordon in Augusta, Georgia, where he had been discharged, en route to rejoin his family in North Carolina. When the bus reached a rest stop just outside Augusta, Woodard asked the bus driver if there was time for him to use a restroom. The driver grudgingly acceded to the request after an argument. Woodard returned to his seat from the rest stop without incident, and the bus departed. The bus stopped in Batesburg (now Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina), near Aiken. Though Woodard had caused no disruption (other than the earlier argument), the driver contacted the local police (including Chief Lynwood Shull), who forcibly removed Woodard from the bus. After demanding to see his discharge papers, a number of Batesburg policemen, including Shull, took Woodard to a nearby alleyway, where they beat him repeatedly with nightsticks. They then took Woodard to the town jail and arrested him for disorderly conduct, accusing him of drinking beer in the back of the bus with other soldiers. Newspaper accounts vary on what happened next (and accounts sometimes spelled his name as \\"Woodward\\"), but author and attorney Michael R. Gardner said in 2003: > In none of the papers is there any suggestion there was verbal or physical > violence on the part of Sergeant Woodard. It's quite unclear what really > happened. What did happen with certainty is the next morning when the sun > came up, Sergeant Isaac Woodard was blind for life. During the course of the night in jail, Shull beat and blinded Woodard, who later stated in court that he was beaten for saying \\"Yes\\" instead of \\"Yes, sir\\". He also suffered partial amnesia as a result of his injuries. Woodard further testified that he was punched in the eyes by police several times on the way to the jail, and later repeatedly jabbed in his eyes with a billy club.Myers (2002), Blinding Isaac Woodard: Woodard testimony, November 1947 Part 3 Newspaper accountsWhile newspaper accounts indicate that Woodard's eyes had been \\"gouged out\\"; historical documents indicate that each globe was ruptured irreparably in the socket.Myers (2002), Blinding Isaac Woodard: \\"Isaac Woodard, Jr.: Medical reports\\" The following morning, the Batesburg police sent Woodard before the local judge, who found him guilty and fined him fifty dollars. The soldier requested medical assistance, but it took two more days for a doctor to be sent to him. Not knowing where he was and suffering from amnesia, Woodard ended up in a hospital in Aiken, receiving substandard medical care. Three weeks after he was reported missing by his relatives, Woodard was discovered in the hospital. He was immediately rushed to an Army hospital in Spartanburg. Though his memory had begun to recover by that time, doctors found both eyes were damaged beyond repair. =National outcry= Though the case was not widely reported at first, it was soon covered extensively in major national newspapers. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) worked to publicize Woodard's plight, campaigning for the state government of South Carolina to address the incident, which it dismissed. On his ABC radio show Orson Welles Commentaries, actor and filmmaker Orson Welles crusaded for the punishment of Shull and his accomplices. On the broadcast July 28, 1946, Welles read an affidavit sent to him by the NAACP and signed by Woodard. He criticized the lack of action by the South Carolina government as intolerable and shameful.Orson Welles Commentaries ‚Äî \\"Affidavit of Isaac Woodward\\", July 28, 1946 Woodard was the focus of Welles's four subsequent broadcasts.Leaming, Barbara, Orson Welles, A Biography. New York: Viking, 1985 \\"The NAACP felt that these broadcasts did more than anything else to prompt the Justice Department to act on the case,\\" wrote the Museum of Broadcasting in a 1988 exhibit on Welles.Orson Welles on the Air: The Radio Years. New York: The Museum of Broadcasting, catalog for exhibition: October 28 ‚Äì December 3, 1988, p. 66 Musicians wrote songs about Woodard and the attack. A month after the beating, calypso artist Lord Invader recorded an anti-racism song for his album Calypso at Midnight; it was entitled \\"God Made Us All\\", with the last line of the song directly referring to the incident. Later that year, folk artist Woody Guthrie recorded \\"The Blinding of Isaac Woodard,\\" which he wrote for his album The Great Dust Storm. He said that he wrote the song \\"...so's you wouldn't be forgetting what happened to this famous Negro soldier less than three hours after he got his Honorable Discharge down in Atlanta....\\"\\"The Blinding of Isaac Woodward\\" (Woody Guthrie; 1946) , Fortune City =Federal response= On September 19, 1946, seven months after the incident, NAACP Executive Secretary Walter Francis White met with President Harry S. Truman in the Oval Office to discuss the Woodard case. Gardner writes that when Truman \\"heard this story in the context of the state authorities of South Carolina doing nothing for seven months, he exploded.\\" The following day, Truman wrote a letter to Attorney General Tom C. Clark demanding that action be taken to address South Carolina's reluctance to try the case. Six days later, on September 26, Truman directed the Justice Department to open an investigation. A short investigation followed, and on October 2, Shull and several of his officers were indicted in U.S. District Court in Columbia. It was within federal jurisdiction because the beating had occurred at a bus stop on federal property and at the time Woodard was in uniform of the armed services. The case was presided over by Judge Julius Waties Waring. By all accounts, the trial was a travesty. The local U.S. Attorney charged with handling the case failed to interview anyone except the bus driver, a decision that Waring, a civil rights proponent, believed was a gross dereliction of duty. Waring later wrote of being disgusted at the way the case was handled at the local level, commenting, \\"I was shocked by the hypocrisy of my government ...in submitting that disgraceful case\\". The defense did not perform better. When the defense attorney began to shout racial epithets at Woodard, Waring stopped him immediately. During the trial, the defense attorney stated to the all-white jury that \\"if you rule against Shull, then let this South Carolina secede again.\\"The Stan Iverson Memorial Library, Infoshop & Anarchist Archives (Due to disfranchisement of blacks in the South, they were also excluded from juries.) After Woodard gave his account of the events, Shull firmly denied it. He claimed that Woodard had threatened him with a gun and that Shull had used his nightclub in self-defense. During this testimony, Shull admitted that he repeatedly struck Woodard in the eyes. On November 5, after 30 minutes of deliberation (15 according to at least one news report), the jury found Shull not guilty on all charges, despite his admission that he had blinded Woodard. The courtroom broke into applause upon hearing the verdict. The failure to convict Shull was perceived as a political failure by the Truman administration. Shull was never punished, dying in Batesburg on December 27, 1997, at age 95. Woodard moved north after the trial during the Second Great Migration and lived in the New York City area for the rest of his life. He died at age 73 in the Veterans Administration hospital in the Bronx on September 23, 1992. He was buried with military honors at the Calverton National Cemetery (Section 15, Site 2180) in Calverton, New York. Aftermath =Influence in American politics= In December 1946, after meeting with White and other leaders of the NAACP, and a month after the jury acquitted Shull, Truman established the Civil Rights Commission by Executive Order 9808; a fifteen-member, interracial group, including the President of General Electric, Charles E. Wilson; academics such as John Sloan Dickey from Dartmouth College; and Sadie Tanner Alexander, a black attorney for the city of Philadelphia, as well as other activists. He asked them to report by the end of 1947. Truman made a strong speech on civil rights on June 29, 1947, to the NAACP, the first American president to speak to their meeting, which was broadcast by radio from where they met on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The President said that civil rights was a moral priority, and it was his priority for the federal government. He had seen by Woodard's and other cases that the issue could not be left to state and local governments. He said: > It is my deep conviction that we have reached a turning point in our > country's efforts to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizens. > Recent events in the United States and abroad have made us realize that it > is more important today than ever before to ensure that all Americans enjoy > these rights. When I say all Americans‚ÄîI mean all Americans. On February 2, 1948, Truman sent the first comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress. It incorporated many of the thirty-five recommendations of his commission. In July 1948, over the objection of senior military officers, Truman issued Executive Order 9981, banning racial discrimination in the U.S. Armed Forces, and Executive Order 9980 to integrate the federal government. (Facilities had been segregated under President Woodrow Wilson). This was in response to a number of incidents against black veterans, most notably the Woodard case. The armed forces and federal agencies led the way in US for integration of the workplace, public facilities and schools. Over the decades, the decision meant that both institutions benefited from the contributions of minorities. Nevertheless, polls showed opposition to Truman's civil rights efforts. They likely cost him some support in his 1948 reelection bid against Thomas Dewey.Gardner, Michael. Harry Truman and Civil Rights: Moral Courage and Political Risks, Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois Press, 2002 Although Truman narrowly won, Gardner believes that his continued championing of civil rights as a federal priority cost him much support, especially in the Solid South. Southern Democrats had long exercised outsize political power in Congress, having disfranchised most blacks there since the turn of the 20th Century, but benefiting by apportionment based on total population. Truman's efforts threatened other changes, since numerous communities across the country had restrictive covenants that were racially discriminatory. Because of his low approval ratings and a bad showing in early primaries, Truman chose not to seek re-election in 1952, though he could have done so. He had been exempted from the term limitations under the 22nd amendment. =Influence on popular culture= Welles revisited the Woodard case in the May 7, 1955, broadcast of his BBC TV series, Orson Welles' Sketch Book.Welles, Orson, and Peter Bogdanovich, This is Orson Welles. New York: HarperCollins Publishers 1992 Guthrie later recalled, \\"I sung 'The Blinding of Isaac Woodard' in the Lewisohn Stadium (in New York City) one night for more than 36,000 people, and I got the loudest applause I've ever got in my whole life.\\" In January 2019, a new book about the Woodard story and its aftermath, Unexampled Courage: The Blinding of Isaac Woodard and the Awakening of President Harry S.

Definition If :\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = A(t)\\\\mathbf{x} is a linear non-autonomous dynamical system in Rn with fundamental solution matrix Œ¶(t), Œ¶(0) = I, then the equilibrium point 0 is said to have an exponential dichotomy if there exists a (constant) matrix P such that P2 = P and positive constants K, L, Œ±, and Œ≤ such that : \\\\Phi(t) P \\\\Phi^{-1}(s)  \\\\le Ke^{-\\\\alpha(t - s)}\\\\mbox{ for }s \\\\le t < \\\\infty and : \\\\Phi(t) (I - P) \\\\Phi^{-1}(s)  \\\\le Le^{-\\\\beta(s - t)}\\\\mbox{ for }s \\\\ge t > -\\\\infty. If furthermore, L = 1/K and Œ≤ = Œ±, then 0 is said to have a uniform exponential dichotomy. The constants Œ± and Œ≤ allow us to define the spectral window of the equilibrium point, (‚àíŒ±, Œ≤). Explanation The matrix P is a projection onto the stable subspace and I ‚àí P is a projection onto the unstable subspace. What the exponential dichotomy says is that the norm of the projection onto the stable subspace of any orbit in the system decays exponentially as t ‚Üí ‚àû and the norm of the projection onto the unstable subspace of any orbit decays exponentially as t ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû, and furthermore that the stable and unstable subspaces are conjugate (because \\\\scriptstyle P \\\\oplus (I - P) = \\\\mathbb{R}^n). An equilibrium point with an exponential dichotomy has many of the properties of a hyperbolic equilibrium point in autonomous systems. In fact, it can be shown that a hyperbolic point has an exponential dichotomy. References Coppel, W. A.

Pg 139 Salama Musa was a journalist, writer, advocate of secularism, and pioneer of Egyptian socialism. He wrote or translated 45 published books; his writings still influence Arab thought and he is frequently referred to. Salama Musa campaigned against traditional religion and urged Egyptian society to embrace European culture.Meisami, S. Julie, Starkey, Paul. Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature, Volume 2. Routledge, New York, NY 1998 pp. 554-555 He looked for political and economic independence of Egypt from the British colonization. To this end he corresponded with Gandhi who provided him with his tools of economic struggle against the British hegemony over the Indian textile industry. Mousa made use of his contact with Gandhi in helping out the national Egyptian industrialist Tala'at Harb (1867-1941) to set up independent outlets for the Egyptian textile industry nationwide in Egypt - an attempt that was vehemently resisted by the British colonial powers of the time. Mousa pleaded, for instance, in his book Ha'ula'i 'allamuni (Those who inspired me, Cairo, 1953) for the independence of thought and indigenous creativity of the contemporary Egyptians and Arabs. Mousa went in his youth to England and adhered there to Bernard Shaw's Fabian Society. Early life Musa's father died when Salama Musa was still a young child, leaving the family an inheritance that allowed them to live comfortably. Salama Musa received his elementary education in a Coptic school, but in 1903 he moved to Cairo to receive a secondary education. The Khedivial College where Musa attended was run like a military camp with harsh punishment for misbehavior dished out by the British instructors.Musa, Salama. The Education of Salama Musa. E.J. Brill, Leiden, Netherlands. 1961 In Cairo during the early 20th century there was rising anti-British sentiment rooted in the nationalist movement, and Qasim Amin's movement for the liberation of women was creating a stir. While in Cairo, Musa was exposed to writers such as Farah Antun, Jurji Zaydan, and Ahmad Lutfi Al-Sayyid that discussed modern and at the time radical ideas such as Social Darwinism, women's rights, and nationalism. Growing up as a religious minority in Muslim dominated Egypt he was attracted to these ideas. After secondary school Musa was interested in studying European literature and science, but was unable to receive a postsecondary education in Egypt, because this advanced education was monopolized by Al Azhar and Dar al-‚ÄòUlum, both of which required students to be Muslim.Ibrahim, A. Ibrahim \\"Salama Musa: An Essay on Cultural Alienation\\". Middle Eastern Studies. Vol. 15, No. 3 (October 1979), pp. 346-357 Europe In 1907, Musa traveled to France to continue his education and he was exposed to a modern, secularized Europe rampant with socialist ideologies. Musa also experienced a new and empowered woman with social freedoms. In Montlh√©ry, a small village near Paris, he started studying socialism and evolution, and the French language.Egger, Vernon. \\"A Fabian in Egypt: Salamah Musa and the Rise of the Professional Classes in Egypt, 1909-1939.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 20, No. 1 (February 1988), pp. 123-126 Musa studied Egyptian civilization upon his return to Egypt in 1908.Egger, Vernon. \\"A Fabian in Egypt: Salamah Musa and the Rise of the Professional Classes in Egypt, 1909-1939.\\", Lanham, MD 1986 University Press of America, Inc In 1909 he moved to England to improve his knowledge of the English language, and briefly studied law at Lincoln's Inn. In England, socialism was on the rise as well as ideas of Social Darwinism, Musa had a lot of interactions with members of the Fabian Society and became a member in July 1909. Musa embraced Fabian ideas of getting rid of the landed classes and empowering the peasant the ideas, and wanted to realize them in Egypt. In 1910, he wrote his first book, Muqaddimat al-superman, comparing European life with the lives of the Egyptians and the social injustices they faced on a daily basis. In 1914, Salama Musa returned to Egypt and started his first weekly magazine, Al-Mustaqbal, with Farah Antun and Yaqub Sarruf on topics such as evolution, national unity, and socialism. The British- controlled government responded to these radical ideas by shutting down the magazine after 16 issues. The 1920s were an active time for Musa as well as Egypt and were considered a revolutionary period in culture and literature; Musa formed a socialist party, which was promptly dissolved under pressure and intimidation by the government.Sami, A. Hanna., George, H. Gardner. Arab Socialism: A Documentary Survey. E.J. Brill, Leiden, Netherlands 1969, pp. 49-57 In the same year, he proceeded to establish the Egyptian Academy for Scientific Education, which was, after only 10 years of operation, shut down by the government as well. Musa wanted Egypt to shift to a Europeanized thought and abandon old traditions and customs regarding the role of women in Egyptian life and secularism and so was criticized and attacked. In 1936, he proclaimed that socialism would sweep Egypt before he turned 100 years old. He spent a brief stint as editor for the social affairs ministry and, in 1942, Musa was jailed on charges of sabotage, which were trumped up charges for criticizing the ruling family. Revolution The 1952 revolution was a turning point in Egyptian history where Nasserism was taking hold and nationalization of Egypt had begun. Salama Musa remained an important figure during this period and was appointed supervisor of the science section in Akhbar el-Yom, a position that he held until his death in 1958. Legacy Salama Musa believed that the minority Copts were descended from the Pharaohs and therefore the true Egyptians. He fought to try to get the Egyptian dialect taught as the official language. In the 1930s Musa affirmed his belief in a shared humanity and was an advocate of secularism, democracy, and the liberation of women. Salama Musa at this time supported workers' and peasants' rights, an improved working environment, and reforms in public education. Seminars led by Musa discussing social issues drew large crowds of young intellectuals. However, Musa abandoned these ideas in the mid 1940s and retreeted to Coptic communalism. Salama Moussa became seriously ill and died on 4 August 1958, a few months after turning 71.

Language The Delaware peoples traditionally spoke the Delaware language (also known as the Lenape language), Munsee and Unami, two closely related languages of the Eastern Algonquian subgroup of the Algonquian language family. History The Lenape people were divided into three dialectal divisions, which later became the basis for the three Clans of the Lenape. These divisions were the Monsi (Munsee) or Wolf, the Unami or Turtle, and the Unilactigo or Turkey. Today the clans are known as the T√πkwsit (Wolf Clan), P√πkuw√†nko (Turtle Clan), and P√´le (Turkey Clan). The Delaware Nation is the P√πkuw√†nko (Turtle Clan). The Delaware Nation was the first Indian nation to enter into a treaty with the newly formed government of the United States; the treaty was signed on September 17, 1778. The Oklahoma branches were established in 1867, with the purchase of land by Delaware from the Cherokee Nation; they made two payments totaling $438,000. A court dispute followed over whether the sale included citizenship rights for the Delaware within the Cherokee Nation. In 1867, the courts ruled that they had only purchased rights to the land for their lifetimes. The Curtis Act of 1898 dissolved tribal governments and ordered the allotment of tribal lands to individual members of tribes. The Lenape fought the act in the courts but lost. The lands were allotted in lots in 1907, with any land left over sold to non-Indians. The tribe became federally recognized on July 5, 1958 as the \\"Delaware Tribe of Western Oklahoma.\\" They ratified their current constitution in 1972. In November 1999, the tribe officially changed its name to the Delaware Nation.McCollum, Timothy James. Delaware, Western. Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture.

Because the extinguishment occurred prior to the passage of the first Indian Nonintercourse Act in 1790, that Act did not avail the Delaware. As a result the court granted the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss.

It spoofs George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead and shows many similarities to Peter Jackson's Braindead.  Plot  Woody Invincible and Crazy Bee are two young men selling bootlegged DVDs at a small stall in the New Trend Plaza Mall. They spend most of their days gambling and committing petty crimes. They meet Rolls, an employee at the beauty parlor, then have a run-in with Mr. Kui, the cellphone store owner. Rolls frequents a sushi bar in the mall, and flirts with the waiter Loi, who is smitten with her. Elsewhere, black market dealers sell to three government agents a bioweapon which turns people into zombies. They brought a zombie to demonstrate the substance's effect, but it breaks out and kills two agents. On the way back after picking up their boss' fixed car, Woody hits the surviving agent, who is carrying a sample of a bioweapon contained in a soft drink bottle. Thinking he needs a drink, Woody pours the sample into his mouth. The two bring him back to the mall, and Woody damages the car again. The reanimated agent slips out of the car, dropping his cellphone. Woody sells the cellphone to Kui, but still doesn't have enough money to fix the car. The two then robs Rolls‚Äô money and ring. A suspicious Rolls asks Woody to find the robbers in return for a free meal. She intends to get him drunk, so he would admit committing the robbery. At the Sushi bar, they get drunk, much to the chagrin of Loi. Woody and Rolls head to the bathroom to have sex. An anxious Loi follows them, but is injured by the zombified agent. He alerts Woody and Rolls, but the zombie is already gone when they check. Rolls lets Loi rest at the beauty parlor. Loi reanimates and keeps Rolls captive as he still has affection for her. The agent retrieves his cellphone from Kui's shop. Kui accuses Woody and Bee of theft, and Ox, a security guard, calls the police. Two policemen, known only by their badge numbers, #3001 and #9466, question the Kui's, Woody and Bee. Woody and Bee's behaviors makes the officers suspicious, and #9466 eventually handcuffs them in the security guard's office. While #3001 goes around the mall to find witnesses to the theft, he is killed by Loi. The agent burst into the security office, kills Ox and attacks #9466. The policeman kills the zombie, but dies from his injuries. Bee gets the handcuff key from #9466, and frees himself and Woody. The two heads to the mall entrance, and sees Jelly, Rolls' co-worker, who just got back after a walk. The reanimated Ox remotely closes the mall's shutter, trapping everyone inside. The three then meets the Kui's, who just had a brief run-in with a zombie, and the group hides in the beauty parlor. Woody heads out alone to call the police. He rescues Rolls while Loi is distracted fighting off the zombies coming for her. They head back to the beauty parlor, and the group decide to escape instead of waiting for rescue. They board an elevator, but it cannot move due to the weight limit. When a zombie closes in, Kui pushes Jelly out. Disgusted, the rest of the group exits the elevator and goes back for Jelly, but finds her dead. They head to the security office, killing zombies on the way. Mrs. Kui is separated from the group and attacked by zombies. Kui, who is hiding nearby, tries to help, but is killed along with his wife. Bee arrives and, distracted by Mrs. Kui's death, is bitten. At the security office, Woody, Rolls and Bee cannot find the security key to open the entrance door. After saying his last words, Bee is killed by Ox. Enraged, Woody beheads Ox, then cuts off Bee's head before he reanimates. Woody and Rolls head down the parking garage, now crawling with zombies. Fighting their way through the shambling undead, they reach Woody's boss‚Äô car. Loi appears, lifts up the garage shutter, then pushes the car out so that the two can escape. At a gas station, Woody is unable to find a working phone. He sees an emergency broadcast, which warns people against drinking soft drinks. Looking outside, Woody sees Rolls drinking from the bottle which he earlier took from the agent. Woody briefly considers killing Rolls, but instead drinks the rest of the soft drink, and the movie ends.

Programme of work UNA-UK's policy work can be split into three main areas: *A Safer World: UNA-UK's peace and security programme focuses on three issues crucial to building a safer world: nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation; preventing and resolving conflict; and emerging security challenges. *A Fairer World: UNA-UK's human rights and humanitarian programme focuses on three issues crucial to building a fairer world: protecting civilian lives; upholding international law; and securing rights for everyone. *A Sustainable World: UNA-UK's international development and environment programme focuses on three issues crucial to building a more sustainable world: building food security, growing responsibly and tackling poverty. Alongside these broad policy areas, UNA-UK's campaigns include: * Keeping Britain Global: UNA-UK seeks to highlight the need for the UK to develop a comprehensive strategy for investing in the health of the UN and urges an increased awareness of how Britain's own conduct, both domestically and on the world stage, affects the well-being of the international system. * Mission Justice: UNA-UK calls for greater decisive action in order to combat sexual abuse by peacekeepers. * 1 for 7 Billion campaign: Co-founded by UNA- UK, this campaign calls for national governments to stand up for a fairer process at the United Nations. All-Party Parliamentary Group on the United Nations UNA-UK acts as the secretariat for The All‚ÄêParty Parliamentary Group on the United Nations (UN APPG), a cross‚Äêparty group supporting the aims and ideals of the United Nations. The UN APPG's primary objective is to raise awareness among MPs and Peers ‚Äì about the UN; about its myriad contributions across the areas of peace and security, development and human rights; about the scope of international law and its relevance to the UK; and about the applicability of the UN to the people who make up the British electorate. In partnership with UN APPG Officers, UNA-UK sets out the strategic plan for the Group for each parliamentary session and reports back on the activity of the Group to its members. The UN APPG meets six to eight times a year to provide a platform for high‚Äêlevel international speakers. The Sir Brian Urquhart Award Each year, UNA-UK presents the Sir Brian Urquhart Award for Distinguished Service to the UN. The award celebrates Sir Brian's unparalleled contribution to the UN, and is presented to individuals whose work reflects Sir Brian's own dedication and endeavour. During his four decades of service to the UN, Sir Brian was instrumental in creating the organisation's administrative framework. He is now a member of UNA-UK's expert advisory panel. Past recipients of the award include: *2011: Dame Margaret Anstee *2012: Sir Richard Jolly * 2013: Ian Martin * 2014: Lynn Davies * 2015: Lord Hannay of Chiswick * 2016: Christine Chinkin * 2017: Lord Judd of Portsea 'In Larger Freedom in the UK' In early 2005 UNA-UK was tasked by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to conduct a public and expert engagement process on UN reform in the lead up to the UN Millennium Review Summit in September 2005. A series of national and regional public debates were undertaken to examine the recommendations made in the UN Secretary-General's Report, In Larger Freedom. The purpose of the debates was to ensure the widest possible public input into the development of the UK government's priorities for the 2005 World Summit. The events proved very popular, attracting a cross- section of society, including youth, trade unions, parliamentarians, NGOs, the armed services and academia. Common themes emerged: a clear and widespread support for a strengthened United Nations, and a reaffirmation of the UN's unique importance as both a forum for negotiating viable solutions to collective threats, and an instrument for taking collective action to meet diverse threats, from climate change to terrorism. UNA-UK compiled a report based on the feedback received and supplemented this with expert input. On 28 November at Portcullis House Foreign Office Minister Lord Triesman and UNA-UK Executive Director Sam Daws launched 'In Larger Freedom in the UK'. The launch took place following a talk by Edward Mortimer, Director of Communications and Chief Speechwriter in the UN Secretary-General's Office, at the inaugural meeting of the United Nations All-Party Parliamentary Group. The audience included parliamentarians, UNA-UK members, staff from the UN family in London, civil servants and NGO representatives.

From its modest start in 1923 until the chain's demise in 1987, Ohrbach's expanded dramatically after World War II, and opened numerous branch locations in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. Its original flagship store was located on Union Square in New York City, and they maintained home and administrative offices in Newark as well as in Los Angeles. The retailer would eventually close the Newark offices in the 1970s. Paul L√°szl√≥ designed the Union Square store as well as many of their other stores. History Ohrbach's first store opened on October 4, 1923, in the fire-damaged building where Adolph Zukor operated the world's first nickelodeon.Ferry, John William. A History of the Department Store. Pages 80-81. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1960 ASIN B000E1B216 Founder Nathan M. Ohrbach launched his store with partner Max Wiesen, a dress manufacturer. After a time there was a falling-out between the partners. Wiesen refused to sell out so Ohrbach leased quarters nearby to open a second store. This move forced Wiesen to sell out.Mahoney, Tom, and Leonard Sloane. The Great Merchants: America's Foremost Retail Institutions and the People Who Made Them Great. Page 312. New York, NY: Harper & Row, 1974 =Sale policies= When Ohrbach opened his store, he believed in cutting service to the bare essentials and sharing the savings with his customers. He also priced his goods in even numbers, while most of his competitors priced their goods in odd prices. Wiesen brought women's ready-to-wear in the form of job lots, seconds, manufacturer's overstocks, and irregulars. Ohrbach sold these in large volume and at low prices. After buying out Wiesen in 1928, he added men's and children's furnishings and accessories. He started to ‚Äútrade up‚Äù his women's wear and offer higher style garments. Other policies formalized at this time were no price advertising, minimum sales force, no alterations, no deliveries, cash and carry, and no special sales periods.Mahoney, Tom, and Leonard Sloane. The Great Merchants: America's Foremost Retail Institutions and the People Who Made Them Great. Pages 312-314. New York: Harper & Row, 1974 =Expansion to California= The growth of the fashion industry in California encouraged the company's expansion to the state. The firm employed the services of a buying office in Los Angeles as early as 1939 and by 1945 opened its own. In 1948, it leased three floors and the mezzanine in a wing of the Welton Becket- William Wurdeman designed Prudential Insurance Company building on Wilshire Boulevard‚Äôs Miracle Mile. The success of the Miracle Mile store led the firm in 1953 to open another branch in Downtown Los Angeles when it acquired the twelve-story Milliron's building at 5th and Broadway. The success at this branch was short-lived, however; it first closed five floors as an economic move, but finally, in 1959, closed the branch because of poor results. In the 1960s, additional branches were opened in La Mirada Mall and in 1964 a store in the San Fernando Valley's Panorama City Shopping Center (the building is now occupied by the Valley Indoor Swap Meet.Mahoney, Tom, and Leonard Sloane. The Great Merchants: America's Foremost Retail Institutions and the People Who Made Them Great. Page 320. New York: Harper & Row, 1974 In 1965, the Miracle Mile store was relocated in the former Seibu Department Store at Wilshire and Fairfax Avenue. This is the current location of the Petersen Automotive Museum.Roderick, Kevin, and Lynxwiler, J. Eric. Wilshire Boulevard: Grand Concourse of Los Angeles, Pages 140,143. Santa Monica, CA: Angel City Press, 2005 Ohrbach's was an anchor of the Los Cerritos Center in Cerritos, in the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, they opened another store in the Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California. The architecture of the Cerritos and Glendale store had an unusual tile front which helped customers know which store was Ohrbach's in these new large malls with several major department stores. Ohrbach's supplied clothing for the television soap operas: All My Children, Dark Shadows, The Doctors, the short lived weekly drama Coronet Blue, the comedy Mister Ed, I Love Lucy, The Donna Reed Show, and others. =Later history= In 1954, Ohrbach's moved from its Union Square location to West 34th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues across from the Empire State Building. The eleven-story building was formerly occupied by McCreery's Department Stores. In 1962, the Netherlands based Brenninkmeyer Company started buying into the firm until Nathan Ohrbach's retirement in 1965 when it had complete control. Hendrickson, Robert. The Grand Emporiums: The Illustrated History of American‚Äôs Great Department Stores. Page 445. New York, NY: Stein and Day, 1979, In 1967, they opened their first suburban New Jersey store at The Bergen Mall. Ohrbach's was one of five anchor stores located in downtown Newark, New Jersey during the last half of the 20th century. Following race rioting in July 1967, business started to fall off at downtown stores, and conditions continued to worsen during the early 1970s. In 1973, Ohrbach's announced that it would close its store in Newark following the Christmas shopping season of that year. The store closed in January 1974 following a liquidation sale, and the remaining corporate offices located on the 5th and 6th floors of the Newark building relocated to space at the 34th Street store. The company's credit operations, also headquartered in the Newark building were moved to space in the firm's Bergen Mall location. At the time of Ohrbach's departure the other department stores operating in Newark stated they were still committed to downtown, but they would start to close in 1976, and by 1992, the last remaining hold out, Macy's/Bamberger's , shuttered its downtown location. In June 1986, Brenninkmeyer's Amcena (renamed American Retail Group in 1994) acquired Howland-Steinbach from Supermarkets General Corp and announced the shuttering of all six California locations as well as Ohrbach's flagship store on 34th Street. The remaining five stores, plus one unit under construction in the Smith Haven Mall reopened under the Steinbach banner on February 1, 1987.

The original railway closed in 1965, with the track being lifted in 1975.  Original line  The broad-gauge railway was opened in 1860 from Carmarthen to Conwil (now Cynwyl) by the ill-fated Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway Company (CCR), which fell in and out of insolvency until it was eventually absorbed by the Great Western Railway. Despite hostility from GWR, the line never actually reached Cardigan - getting no further than Newcastle Emlyn. The Manchester and Milford Railway made a junction with the CCR at Pencader, making a through route to Lampeter which, in turn, later extended to Aberystwyth. In 1872, the line became the last in Wales to be converted from Brunel's gauge to . In its early days, the line thrived by serving the local farming and wool industries though, in the years following the First World War, this traffic gradually declined. The Second World War brought another lease of life as a relief route carrying heavy ammunition trains between south and north Wales. Between the wars, the GWR sought to encourage traffic, opened several new halts along the route and provided camping coaches at several stations. The route earned a reputation as a meandering rural branch; where trains trundled along, often flagged down by market-bound farmers' wives making their way across the fields to board the carriages. In fact, nearly three hours was permitted for the journey between Carmarthen and Aberystwyth. In the post-war years, closure of the spurs off the main line began. The Branches to Aberaeron and Newcastle Emlyn closed in 1952 which left only the route between Carmarthen and Aberystwyth open to traffic. The line enjoyed a brief resurgence in the 1950s, when the Royal Train traversed the route and other new traffic included Butlins through- specials taking holidaymakers to the new camp in Pwllheli. However, declining passenger figures meant that the Beeching Axe was inevitable. In the end however, it was nature that struck the first blow. Heavy flooding severed the line from Aberystwyth in December 1964, this taking place in the same weekend that storms that caused the Ruabon to Barmouth Line to suffer a similar washout. The last passenger train ran along the truncated route on 22 February 1965, two Hymek diesels providing the motive power. The line remained open for freight using Hymek locomotives until around 1970, then by Class 37 locomotives. The freight traffic that kept the remainder of the line open was dominated mainly by milk traffic between Carmarthen and Lampeter where traffic was routed to both the last remaining part of the main line to Aberystwyth as far as the milk creamery at Pont Llanio (near Llanddewi-Brefi which survived until 1970, plus the Aberaeron branch as far as the milk creamery at Green Grove near Felin Fach which continued in service until discontinued by British Rail in 1973. This resulted in the final closure of the line. Track was left in place until the summer of 1975.  Gwili Railway Preservation Company  Following the line's closure, the Gwili Railway Preservation Company was formed with the ambition to preserve at least of track of the former route, from Abergwili Junction right up the Gwili Valley to the station site at Llanpumpsaint. Track lifting had already started at the time of the formation of the new Company and, as a result, only of track north of Bronwydd Arms was left in situ, the Company being able to acquire the full stretch of trackbed from Abergwili Junction to Llanpumsaint for both rebuilding and preserving. Over time, the Railway has extended the operational length from to over , as well as reconstructing original features at Bronwydd Arms station and amassing a collection of locomotives and rolling stock. The Gwili Railway was set up in 1975, and within three years the railway had purchased of track (between the sites of Abergwili Junction and Llanpumpsint railway station) and was running an initial steam-hauled service on a section. In April 1978, it re-opened the section of the Carmarthen-Aberystwyth route from its base at Bronwydd Arms, ( north of Carmarthen), making it the first standard-gauge heritage railway to operate in Wales. The railway had been working south towards Carmarthen to a new station site named \\"Abergwili Junction\\" built on the northern outskirts of Carmarthen, at the site of the old and former Abergwili junction.http://www.ukplanning.com/carmarthenshire/showCaseFile.do;jsessionid=27B2FF9A2CBDA35BFB4A3DBCE0608AEC.wam2?action=show&appType;=planning%20folder&appNumber;=W/19935 PLANNING ON OLD ABERGWILI JUNCTION SITE from Carmarthenshire County Council =Route of the Gwili Railway= Trains on the Gwili start from Bronwydd Arms where the replica GWR station is dominated by a Signal Box saved from Llandybie railway station on the Heart of Wales Line. The Signal box, which is open to the public, was built in 1885 and has been restored to operate signalling within the station area. Typical features on the line include the gradients such as the 1 in 60 on the bank immediately north of Bronwydd Arms, the meandering River Gwili and the A484 road which are never far away and the wooded forests and sharp curves as the railway twists its way through the valley. Peckett 0-4-0ST 'Olwen' at Bronwydd Arms From Bronwydd, the line climbs between rural hills and meadows alongside the river River Gwili past the site of the first terminus of the newly opened Gwili Railway next to the old mill at Cwmdwyfran. From here, the line continues climbing until it passes under a rusticated brick bridge at the second terminus at the now defunct Penybont station. The line carries over a redecked bridge crossing the River Gwili. This expansion was achieved in time for its 10th anniversary celebrations in 1988. At the same time, the new terminus of Llwyfan Cerrig was opened to the public. In 2001, a further extension built by volunteer labour was opened to a new halt at Danycoed. Llwyfan Cerrig (in English, Stone Platform) was a former quarrymen's halt and the Gwili Railway has created a nature trail which winds through the old quarry and emerges above the stock sheds. The station building, which originally stood at Felin Fach on the Aberaeron branch and dates from 1911, was dismantled by volunteers and re- erected in the early 1990s. It has been restored and furnished to an authentic 1950s style. From the platform, a path leads to a picnic area on the bank of the Gwili River where kingfishers and heron can sometimes be glimpsed. A miniature railway runs from this station and refreshments can be bought. From Llwyfan Cerrig, the line runs uphill for another with the River Gwili on one side and a rock face on the other, until it reaches the present end of the line at Danycoed (English translation being 'under the wood') where a typical GWR rural halt has been recreated. Operationally, the railway is normally run on a 'one engine in steam' basis although the facility exists to pass trains at Llwyfan Cerrig at busy periods such as Day Out With Thomas events. In recent years, the Railway has expanded the portfolio of events on offer with Dining Trains, Driver Experience days and Jazz and other themed nights now being part of the annual timetable. =Incident= On 19 July 2006 a volunteer was killed in an accident when coupling carriages together for the train that was due to run that day.  Future expansion  = Northwards = Restoring the line northwards has proven to be more difficult than the Gwili Railway had initially anticipated, volunteers' high hopes of reaching either Cynwyl Elfed or Llanpumsaint having been hindered by the cost of repairing a number of bridges en route. There are a total of nine bridges between Danycoed Halt and Llanpumsaint, all of which are in poor condition and require extensive refurbishment to be made worthy for rail traffic once more. Eight of the bridges cross the River Gwili, whilst the ninth crosses a road immediately south of the site of Llanpumpsaint railway station. An attempt was made in the early to mid 1990s to extend the railway by laying track southwards from the disused Conwil station site towards the railhead at Llwyfan Cerrig, but was frustrated by the escalating cost of repairing the three river bridges en route. Beyond Llanpumsaint, the track-bed is virtually intact through the tunnel and up to just south of the site of Pencader station; however, the Gwili Railway has no plans to extend further in that direction as it neither owns the land nor has the necessary statutory powers to operate a railway north of Llanpumsaint.https://www.pressreader.com/uk/steam-railway- uk/20170324/282969629889691 = Southwards = RSH Austerity 0-6-0ST 'Welsh Guardsman' runs round at Abergwili Junction The closure of the former (now defunct) Swansea Vale Railway in 2007 resulted in a merger of that society with the Gwili. This has provided a boost to the southern extension (to Abergwili) with track materials, a footbridge, water tanks/cranes and signalling equipment from Swansea now earmarked for use on the Abergwili extension. In 2011, over of track was laid on the southern extension to Abergwili Junction and work started to improve signalling and the level crossing at Bronwydd Arms for future passenger operation. By 2016 the track had extended all the way down and into Abergwili Junction station itself. The extension of the railway to Abergwili Junction finally opened in July 2017, this brings the line up to a total of in length. On 1 July the extension opened for 150 invited guests, with the extension opening to the public the day after, on the 2nd. Abergwili Junction is the permanent southern terminus of the Gwili Railway. The Carmarthen East by-pass (constructed 1997 -1999) followed the course of the old line from Carmarthen to Llandeilo, rendering any extension of the line south beyond Abergwili Junction impossible. However the Aberystwyth-Carmarthen Feasibility study states there is sufficient land alongside the west side of the bypass to reconnect the 2km to Carmarthen station though it would require a new 100m skew bridge across the Afon Tywi just north of Carmarthen station.https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2018-10/aberystwyth- to-carmarthen-rail-reinstatement-feasibility-study.pdf Locomotives =Steam locomotives= Vulcan Foundry Austerity 0-6-0ST 'Haulwen' runs round at Danycoed * 3879 Vulcan Foundry-built Austerity locomotive built in 1945 (works number 5272).

O'Shanassy was born near Thurles in County Tipperary, Ireland, the son of a surveyor, and came to the Port Phillip District (later Victoria) in 1839. He went into business in Melbourne as a draper, and by 1846 he was rich enough to be elected to the Melbourne City Council and to become the founding chairman of the Colonial Bank of Australasia. By the 1850s he was a major landowner and one of the wealthiest men in the colony. He also became a recognised leader of the large Irish Catholic community.  Biography  O'Shanassy was elected to the inaugural Victorian Legislative Council for City of Melbourne in 1851. When Victoria gained responsible government in 1856, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for both Melbourne and Kilmore districts, he decided to represent the latter resulting in a by-election for Melbourne. In 1868 he returned to the Council as member for Central Province, then in 1877 he went back to the Assembly as member for Belfast (later known as Port Fairy), which he represented until 1883. Although he had been regarded as a liberal in his early career, in the colonial Parliament O'Shanassy emerged as the leader of the conservative opposition to the reforming ministry of William Haines, although there was no formal party system in Victoria at this time. His alienation from the liberals was mainly as a result of the tariff issue: most colonial liberals were protectionists, but O'Shanassy was a free trader. When Haines's ministry fell in March 1857, O'Shanassy succeeded him as Premier, but his government fell in April and Haines returned to office. O'Shanassy was Premier again from March 1858 to October 1859 and his deputy was Charles Gavan Duffy. The combination of these two Irish Catholics heading up the colony's administration was a source of great consternation among the Protestant elite and ensured that sectarian issues emerged in the election of 1859.(G. Serle) However, the Duffy/O'Shanassy link strained, possibly, because O'Shanassy departed Ireland before the turmoil of 1848, while Duffy was involved in the 1848s troubles.(O'Brien) O'Shanassy was Premier again from November 1861. By the 1860s O'Shanassy had become a thorough-going conservative and his government was bitterly opposed by the liberal newspaper The Age and its fiery proprietor, David Syme. In retaliation, O'Shanassy withdrew government advertising from the paper. O'Shanassy's government was finally defeated in June 1863 over the land reform issue, and he never held office again. O'Shanassy was awarded a papal knighthood in 1859, but news of that award did not reach Victoria until early 1860. The award was pilloried in the Melbourne Punch (19 January 1860, p. 209). Further, he received CMG in 1869 and a in 1874. He retired from Parliament in February 1883, shortly before his death in Boroondara, Victoria, Australia.

In March 2008 following the success of phase one - direct services between Cardiff Central and Ebbw Vale - the Welsh Government's Minister for Economy and Transport launched a feasibility study into the restoration of direct trains from Newport. Significant works need to be carried out including the re-instatement of a set of points, refurbished track, new signals at the Gaer and Park junctions as well as track extensions between Crosskeys and Llanhilleth. The Welsh Government announced in July 2009 that the relevant works to enable direct trains between Ebbw Vale and Newport would be complete by 2011. After securing the Wales & Borders franchise in 2018, Transport for Wales announced that services will reopen between Newport and Ebbw Vale by 2021. History British Railways Western Region \\"totem\\" sign for Newport High Street. Up freight in 1963 Down iron ore train entering the station in 1963 The current station layout consists of four through-platforms numbered 1 to 4 from the south side. The original broad gauge station had only two through platforms and a bay platform at the east end of the down platform. The Hillfield railway tunnels to the west of the station were dug under Stow Hill in the 1840s. On the closure of Dock Street and Mill Street stations to passengers in 1880, High Street station was greatly expanded: The up platform was made into an island - the north face in length, and the south side . The down platform was extended to , with the west end bay extended to . Two scissors crossovers were provided on these new platforms, effectively dividing them into two. The original down platform became Nos. 1 and 2. The bay became No. 3, the south face of the up platform Nos. 4 and 5 and the north face Nos. 6 and 7. The bay platform was mostly used for Monmouthshire western valleys services, but with the quadrupling of the line in 1912 trains from the bay platform (on the south side) now had to cross the entire station to get to the Gaer Tunnel on the north side. To address this the former loading dock on the north side of the station was made into a passenger platform (No. 8). April 1961 saw the introduction of colour Multiple-Aspect Signalling and associated modifications to the station layout. The north face of the island platform became the new up platform, with the south face becoming the new down. The platforms were also renumbered in the opposite direction to match the new line designations  No. 8 became No. 1, Nos. 6/7 became 2, Nos. 4/5 became No. 5 and Nos. 1/2 became No. 6. Lines 3 and 4 became the designations for the through non-platform lines. Subsequent removal of the scissors crossovers saw a further combination and renumbering of platforms to the current layout. =Name= Exterior of the old concourse, converted to offices in 2011 Originally named Newport High Street, the suffix High Street became unnecessary on the closure of Mill Street and Dock Street stations to goods traffic in the 1960s.Railway Magazine, July 1960 Printed tickets and National Rail enquiries use the suffix \\"South Wales\\" to differentiate this station from its namesake in Essex. In 2007 the Newport Unlimited urban regeneration company proposed the station be renamed Newport City railway station; however, this suggestion was not taken up. Accidents and incidentsOn 19 August 1938, a passenger train was sent into a siding due to a signalman's error. It crashed through the buffers but the locomotive stopped short of falling into the River Usk. Facilities The \\"Archform\\" sculpture by Harvey Hood, in the station forecourt on the site of the old west-facing bay platform Platform 1 is only mainly used for westbound services to Cardiff Central during peak times. Platform 2 is usually the stopping point for all westbound services to Cardiff Central. Platform 3 is usually the stopping point for eastbound services to London Paddington and Nottingham. Platform 4 is usually the stopping point for eastbound services to Manchester Piccadilly, Holyhead, Portsmouth Harbour, Taunton and Cheltenham Spa and will also be used by trains to Ebbw Vale following the full re-opening of the Ebbw Valley Railway. A British Transport Police station and a branch of WH Smith are situated on platform 1. The waiting room and customer toilets are situated between platforms 2 and 3, as is the Upper Crust caf√©. Also between platforms 2 and 3 is a customer help desk. The booking hall is situated between the main entrance and platform 1. There are three main windows for tickets for immediate travel and a travel centre which handles enquiries, complaints and issues tickets for future travel. In the booking hall there is also a small buffet, telephones, automatic ticket machines and a photo booth. Wheelchair access between platforms is provided by a subway, accessed by a lift from the platforms. Also, a ramp from platforms 2 and 3 leads into a subway that links Mill Street to the city centre. There is a short-stay car park and taxi rank situated to the front and a long-stay car park to the rear which is accessible via a footbridge from all platforms. Since October 2005, automatic ticket barriers have been installed. At the same time, the ticket barriers are being used more often, before used during peak periods and match days, now manned throughout the day until late in the evening. =2007 development= The Welsh Government and Network Rail agreed a ¬£20 million makeover for the station that provided two new concourses, a second pedestrian bridge over the tracks and a user-friendly bus-rail interchange at the station. The plans also included an extended platform 4 capable of accommodating up to twelve-carriage intercity trains and a new multi-storey car park for long-stay travellers. The initial redevelopment of Platform 4 did not allow for disabled access, resulting in station staff using a locally contracted taxi firm at ¬£3 a passenger to move disabled and elderly passengers the half-mile from one side of the station to the other, in a complimentary service provision.Taxis used between rail platforms BBC News - 17 August 2007 The first phase, platform 4 extension, was completed on 2 July 2007, with design works completed by Atkins. =2009 development= Panorama of the interior of the new footbridge at the south stairwell. The new concourse during construction in December 2009 Exterior of the new concourse opened 2010 Planned to enable the station to cope with passenger traffic associated with the 2010 Ryder Cup, a second passenger bridge was built linking the whole station with a lift for all platforms. Network Rail claimed accessibility and safety are at the heart of the new design. The new bridge is clad in ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), the material which protects the Eden Project in Cornwall. The station enhancements were engineered by Atkins Engineers, based in Exeter and Swindon, with design support from Grimshaw Architects and Vector Foiltec working as sub-consultants. The new north and south concourses opened on 13 September 2010. The development was criticised by RAIL magazine columnist Barry Doe for being at the wrong end of the station, a lack of seating and generally poor design. The station was nominated in 2011 for the Carbuncle Cup, awarded for the ugliest building of the year. Arriva Trains Wales had expressed concern about a leaking roof, an inadequate customer service area and insufficient ticket gates. Network Rail said the roof was fixed in mid-May 2011, but issues had resumed in 2013. Transport for Wales acquired the management of the station in 2018 and are replacing station infrastructure across the network. =Subsequent developments= The whole Newport area was re-signalled from 2009‚Äì12, providing speed improvements on the relief lines. The Great Western Main Line from London to Cardiff was electrified as part of the Great Western Main Line electrification scheme. As part of this the former footbridge was removed in 2017.Newport railway station footbridge set to be removed South Wales Argus 18 March 2017 Following the introduction of Hitachi Rail British Rail Class 800/802 trains and the new timetable introduced on 15 December 2019, journey times between Newport and London Paddington were reduced to around 1 hour 30 minutes The power from Bristol Parkway through Newport was switched on on 14 September 2019, with electric running extended to Newport from 15 December, and as far as Cardiff over the Christmas period. In September 2018, plans were submitted to Newport City Council for a new footbridge between Devon Place and Queensway, to replace the subway used since the closure of the previous footbridge. The South East Wales Transport Alliance (SEWTA) have proposed an additional service (one in every two hours) to Abergavenny with a re-opened station in Caerleon, two trains per hour between Cwmbran and Abergavenny, and an hourly service to Pontypool and New Inn, subject to line enhancements in Abergavenny. Transport for Wales have included some of these proposals in their plans for the later stages of their South Wales Metro scheme.

A Great Britain international representative or , he began his career at Warrington before joining St Helens, with whom he won a total of four Grand Finals, four Challenge Cups and two World Club Challenges, as well as becoming the first (and currently only) player to win the Man of Steel Award on two consecutive occasions. He is the older brother of former player Danny Sculthorpe. Early years Sculthorpe was born on 22 September 1977 in Burnley, Lancashire, England. He grew up in Oldham, and was educated at Watersheddings Primary School and then Counthill School. He played junior rugby league for Waterhead. He started his professional career with Warrington, making his d√©but in 1995. In 1996, he was named in the inaugural Super League Dream Team, and in the post season he went on the 1996 Great Britain Lions tour of Oceania. Sculthorpe moved to St. Helens in 1997 for ¬£375,000, at the time a record transfer fee for a forward (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£516,500 in 2013). In the 1997 post season, Sculthorpe was selected to play for Great Britain at loose forward in all three matches of the Super League Test series against Australia. St Helens Sculthorpe played for St Helens as a in their 1999 Super League Grand Final victory over Bradford Bulls. Having won the 1999 Championship, St. Helens contested in the 2000 World Club Challenge against National Rugby League Premiers Melbourne Storm, with Sculthorpe playing as a loose forward in the loss. He also played for St Helens at loose forward and kicked a drop goal in their 2000 Super League Grand Final victory over Wigan. As Super League V champions, St Helens played against 2000 NRL Premiers Brisbane Broncos in the 2001 World Club Challenge. Sculthorpe played at loose forward, scoring a try and kicking a drop goal in Saints' victory. Sculthorpe was named as Man of Steel in 2001 and 2002. He was Saints‚Äô sole representative in the 2002 Super League Dream Team, a feat he repeated in 2004. Sculthorpe played for St Helens at stand-off in their 2002 Super League Grand Final victory against Bradford. Having won Super League VI, St Helens contested the 2003 World Club Challenge against 2002 NRL Premiers Sydney Roosters. Sculthorpe played at loose forward in Saints' 38-0 loss. Sculthorpe was named St Helens captain in 2004, and led the team to victory over Wigan in the 2004 Challenge Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. That year he also joined a select band of players to have scored 100 tries and 100 goals in Super League. In the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament, in the final against Australia he played at loose forward in the Lions' 44-4 loss.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/4046521.stm In 2005 Sculthorpe scored his 1,000th point for Saints.He was named as Great Britain captain in 2005, although injury ruled out for the most of 2005's Super League X and prevented him from leading the side in the 2005 Tri-Nations tournament. As one of the stars of the world game, Sculthorpe secured a lucrative sponsorship deal as the face of Gillette, which at the time was the most lucrative sponsorship deal made by any rugby league player worldwide. In March 2006, Sculthorpe signed a deal with Random House to publish his autobiography, Man of Steel, which was published in August 2007. Sculthorpe captained St Helens as a in their 2006 Challenge Cup Final victory against Huddersfield. However his time as Great Britain captain was less successful, as he only ever captained the side for 18 minutes. This came in the one off test game at Knowsley Road in 2006 between Great Britain and New Zealand, in which he was forced off after injuring his knee. Sculthorpe returned from the injury and was named man-of-the-match in St. Helens' win over Brisbane Broncos in the 2007 World Club Challenge. In September 2007 he signed a new 12-month contract with St Helens which saw him celebrate his testimonial season at the club. Sculthorpe's final game for St. Helens was in the 2008 Challenge Cup Final, where he injured his shoulder in the opening minutes. After being injury hit in 2008's Super League XIII with only a handful of games played, St. Helens announced they would release Sculthorpe at the end of the season. He was touted as a potential signing for Salford, or joining up with brother Danny at Wakefield Trinity in time for the 2009 Super League season. However, Sculthorpe announced his retirement from the game on 19 September 2008. He was awarded the honour of MBE in the 2013 New Year's Honours List, for \\"services to Rugby League and to charity\\".

From this, a force is transferred to the mouth / jaw(s) of the subject. Thus a headgear is an orthodontic appliance used to correct bite and support proper jaw alignment and growth. Headgear is typically recommended for children whose jaw bones are still growing. Unlike braces, headgear is worn partially outside of the mouth. An orthodontist may recommend headgear for a patient if their bite is more severely out of alignment. Full view of combination pull orthodontic headgear with facebow The device typically transfers the force to the teeth via a facebow or J hooks to the patient's dental braces or a palatal expander that aids in correcting more severe bite problems or is used in retention of the teeth and jaws of the patient.  Need for treatment and concurrent corrections  Headgear is most commonly used to correct anteroposterior discrepancies. The headgear attaches to the braces via metal hooks or a facebow. Straps or a head cap anchor the headgear to the back of the head or neck. In some situations, both are used. Elastic bands are used to apply pressure to the bow or hooks. Its purpose is to slow or stop the upper jaw from growing, thereby preventing or correcting an overjet. Other forms of headgear treat reverse overjets, in which the top jaw is not forward enough. It is similar to a facemask, also attached to braces, and encourages forward growth of the upper jaw. Headgear can also be used to make more space for teeth to come in. In this instance the headgear is attached to the molars, via molar headgear bands and tubes, and helps to draw these molars backwards in the mouth, opening up space for the front teeth to be moved back using braces and bands. Multiple appliances and accessories are typically used along with the headgear, such as: power chains, coil springs, twin blocks, plates or retainers, facemasks, a headgear helmet (a headgear helmet is a cervical headgear with a cap or rigid helmet that covers the entire head), lip bumpers, palate expanders, elastics, bionaters, Herbst appliances, Wilson appliances, other headgear, hybrid twinblocks, positioner retainers, and jasper jumpers. Many patients wear a combination of, or all of these appliances at any given time in their treatment.  Forms of headgear treatment  Headgear needs to be worn between 12 and 23 hours each day to be effective in correcting the overbite, typically for 12 to 18 months depending on the severity of the overbite, how much it is worn and what growth stage the patient is in. Typically however the prescribed daily wear time will be between 14 and 16 hours a day. Orthodontic headgear will usually consist of three major components: Full orthodontic headgear with headcap, fitting straps, facebow and elastics # Facebow: first, the facebow (or J-Hooks) is fitted with a metal arch onto headgear tubes attached to the rear upper and lower molars. This facebow then extends out of the mouth and around the patients face. J-Hooks are different in that they hook into the patients mouth and attach directly to the brace (see photo for example of J-Hooks). # Head cap: the second component is the headcap, which typically consists of one or a number of straps fitting around the patients head. This is attached with elastic bands or springs to the facebow. Additional straps and attachments are used to ensure comfort and safety (see photo). # Attachment: the third and final component ‚Äì typically consisting of rubber bands, elastics, or springs ‚Äì joins the facebow or J-Hooks and the headcap together, providing the force to move the upper teeth, jaw backwards. Soreness of teeth when chewing or when the teeth touch is typical. Patients usually feel the soreness to 2 to 3 hours later, but younger patients tend to react sooner, (e.g., 1 to hours). The headgear application is one of the most useful appliances available to the orthodontist when looking to correct a Class II malocclusion.  Facemask and reverse-pull headgear  Facemask or reverse-pull headgear with straps hooks for connection of elastic bands into the patients mouth, typically worn 12 to 23 hours a day. Facemask or reverse-pull headgear is an orthodontic appliance typically used in growing patients to correct underbites (technically termed Class-III orthodontic problems) by pulling forward and assisting the growth of the upper jaw (maxilla), allowing it to catch up to the size of the lower jaw (mandible). Facemasks or reverse-pull headgear needs to be worn between 12 and 23 hours per day, but typically 14 to 16 hours a day is effective in correcting the underbite. Overall wear time is usually anywhere from 12 to 18 months depending on the severity of the bite and how much a patient's jaws and bones are growing over this time. The appliance normally consists of a frame or a center bars that are strapped to the patient's head during a fitting appointment. The frame has a section which is positioned in front of the patient's mouth, which allows for the attachment of elastic or rubber bands directly into the mouth area. These elastics are then hooked onto the patient's braces (brackets and bands) or appliance fitted in his or her mouth. This creates a forward pulling force to pull the upper jaw forward. The orthodontic facemask typically consists of three major components: # Face frame: first, the face frame is a metal and plastic structure which is adjusted to fit onto the patient's face. The frame is normally stabilized on the child's face with the aid of a chin cup and a forehead pad. These are padded to ensure patient comfort. The frame typically has a horizontal bar or mouth-yoke, which the orthodontist will adjust so it is correctly positioned in front of the patient's mouth to get the elastics to apply the force in the desired direction. The mouth yoke has a number of hooks (four to six depending on type of appliance, see photo with six hooks), which allows the orthodontist to attach elastics or springs directly into from the facemask into the patient's mouth. The frame allows the patient to move his or her head freely and to talk. All other oral activities are typically limited or restricted, such as eating or playing sports or playing a wind musical instruments, although drinking is recommended using a straw so as not to remove the whole appliance at night or in the day when thirsty. # Head cap: some facemasks and all reverse-pull headgear have a second part which consists of a head cap, and is made up of a number of straps fitting around the patient's head. In this case the head cap is used to stabilize the face-frame described above and to ensure it is held correctly in position (see photo example of reverse-pull headgear with head-strap/cap). # Attachment: the third and final component is the mouth attachment ‚Äì typically using rubber bands ‚Äì joins the facemask from the mouth-yoke into the patient's mouth. The elastics hook on the patient's braces or other such suitable oral appliance. As the elastics are flexible, up to six elastics may be used to provide various forward and sideways forces on the patient's teeth and arch, while still allowing the patient to open and close his or her jaw. Facemask or reverse-pull headgear shows preparation for fitting to a patient with a number of elastic bands into the patients mouth. In some cases surgery is required in conjunction with a facemask or reverse- pull headgear. Many parents and doctors recommend using early intervention (typically between ages 7 to 13) by using a facemask to avoid costly and painful surgical procedures later. The appliance is very effective in correcting Class III orthodontic problems in younger or adolescent patients that are still growing. Initially, it can be difficult for children to wear a mask or headgear, however most doctors and parents agree that children and adolescence adapt quickly to such changes and requirements. Parents should be aware that their child is often better-off wearing a facemask or headgear to avoid later surgery and the patient, friends and school peers normally get used to the new appliance after just a few weeks of wear.  Adverse effects and controversy Researchers who have studied the long-term effects of orthodontic headgear have found that it may flatten the face and prevent the chin from coming forward, pushing both the upper and lower jaw down and back, into the airway. In more technical terms, it inhibits the natural growth of the jaws and lead to a reduction in the SNA and ANB angles, which relate to the forward position of the maxilla and the mandible, and good indicators of the size of a person's airway. The controversy about headgear intensified beginning in the 1980s when formerly head-gear treated patients developed severe health symptoms, such as sleep apnea, breathing problems and acute TMD. In some cases, eye injuries have been reported, which is minimized with the use of safety release straps and safety facebows. Teenagers prescribed orthodontic headgear often face social stigma and bullying. The need for headgear in orthodontics and its application by practitioners has somewhat decreased in recent years as some orthodontists use temporary implants (i.e., temporary anchorage devices) inside the patient's mouth to perform the same tooth movements however the headgear is still widely used and a very effective appliance used by orthodontists today. Soreness of teeth when chewing, or when the teeth touch, is typical. Adults usually feel the soreness 12 to 24 hours later, but younger patients tend to react sooner, (e.g., 2 to 6 hours). Adults are sometimes prescribed headgear but this is less frequent. The headgear is one of the most useful appliances available to the orthodontist, but many patients find it difficult to comply with daytime wear, so it is mainly worn in the evenings and when sleeping. A similar appliance is the reverse-pull headgear or orthodontic facemask, which pulls the patients teeth forward (rather than back, as in this case).

In World War II she served at sea as an engineering officer in the British Merchant Navy and received awards for bravery under enemy fire. Childhood Victoria Drummond was born on 14 October 1894 at Errol, Perthshire, Scotland. Her father was Captain Malcolm Drummond of Megginch, Groom in Waiting to Queen Victoria and Deputy Lieutenant of Perthshire. Her mother, Geraldine Margaret Tyssen-Amherst was the daughter of William Tyssen-Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney. She had two sisters, Jean and Frances, and a younger brother, John Drummond, 15th Baron Strange. She was baptised Victoria after Queen Victoria, who was one of her godmothers. September 2004. Drummond and her siblings were brought up in both the Church of Scotland and the Scottish Episcopal Church. All four worked as children: growing vegetables and flowers to sell and keeping poultry. Drummond's speciality was hand-churning butter. Their privileged upbringing was straitened after one pair of grandparents lost a fortune in investments in 1906. One of Drummond's grandmothers turned wood and ivory and belonged to the Worshipful Company of Turners. Drummond herself became a prizewinning model maker, making her own toys that were shown in exhibitions and won prizes in competitions. Drummond used to visit the engineering works of Robert Morton and Sons in Errol, which built steam-powered and petrol-engined lorries and buses. As a young girl she asked Mr Morton how she could learn to be a marine engineer and go to sea. Morton may or may not have taken the young girl seriously, but he told her to serve an apprenticeship, find a shop with a vacancy and start at the beginning, serve her time and then find a ship that would give her a berth as an engineer. In February 1913 Drummond's parents took her to London where she was presented at court to King George V and Queen Mary as a Debutante. Apprenticeship In 1915 Drummond turned 21 and her father encouraged her to choose her own career. She repeated her ambition to be a marine engineer. From 18 October 1916 she was apprenticed at the Northern Garage, South Street, Perth. Her wage as a first year apprentice was three shillings a week, from which sixpence was deducted for National Insurance so her net wage was half a crown. In her second year her wage before National Insurance was six shillings. Her foreman, a Mr Malcolm, who had worked in Clyde shipyards, gone to sea and risen to be a Chief Engineer at sea, supported her training. On three evenings a week a teacher from Dundee Technical College (now Abertay University) taught her maths and engineering. Mr Malcolm supported Drummond's training but in 1918 the garage dismissed him for drunkenness. Drummond took this as the right time to move on and resigned from the garage. Her father got her an introduction to the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company in Dundee, which took her on in its engine and boiler works at Lilybank in Dundee. She started as a pattern maker for metal casting, and in 1919 was promoted to the finishing shop. She joined the Women's Engineering Society and completed her apprenticeship in 1920 afer which she was elected a graduate of the Institute of Marine Engineers. She stayed on at Caledon as a journeyman, later transferring to the drawing office. . In 1922 Caledon suffered a decline in orders and laid off many workers, including Drummond who left on 7 July. Early years at sea =Anchises= Blue Funnel's , on which Drummond was 10th Engineer 1922‚Äì24 Early in Drummond's time at Caledon, the founder W.B. Thompson introduced her and her parents to Henry Wortley, a director of Blue Funnel Line. Wortley offered Drummond the promise of a position as an engineer at sea when she completed her apprenticeship. When Caledon gave her notice in 1922, Drummond wrote to Wortley to take up his offer. Unknown to Drummond, Wortley had died in 1919. However, Lawrence Holt honoured Wortley's promise and invited her to Liverpool for an interview. Blue Funnel employed Drummond initially in its engineering record office in Liverpool on a salary of ¬£12 a month. About a month later, on 25 August, she was instructed to sign on the passenger liner for a trial trip from Liverpool to Glasgow as an Assistant Engineer. On 2 September she signed on Anchises again as Tenth Engineer. The salary of ¬£10 a month was ¬£2 less than the company had paid her ashore! She served on the ship until 1924, making four voyages to Australia and one to China. On Anchises all the crew, all but one of the officers and most of the passengers accepted having a woman engineer. A few of the women passengers passed demeaning remarks at her. When Anchises usual Second Engineer was taken ill his position was covered by an extra Second, Mr Howard, who Drummond says \\"persecuted\\" her. Drummond was friends with the usual Second Engineer, Malcolm Quayle, who supported her career, was her escort for social events ashore and whom she called her \\"protector\\". The pair had prickly tempers, for which Drummond nicknamed Quayle \\"hedgehog\\" and he nicknamed her \\"Kate\\", after Katherina in William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Quayle was married and had two children, and Drummond was emphatic that there was never any impropriety between them. However, when in 1924 she wanted to take her exams to become a Second Engineer, she unwisely wrote to her manager at Blue Funnel, Mr Freeman, suggesting that Quayle be promoted to Chief Engineer and she could be his Second. This gave Freeman the damaging impression that Quayle and Drummond were having an affair. Drummond left Anchises and Blue Funnel in April 1924. =Mulbera= Drummond began study for her Second Engineer's qualification. In October 1926 she obtained her Second Engineer's Certificate becoming Britain's first certificated woman marine engineer. However, after qualifying, she was able to find work only as a Fifth Engineer, signing on the British-India Steam Navigation Company steam turbine liner on 14 April 1927. She served on the ship until 4 December 1928, completing one voyage to East Africa and four to India and Ceylon. Aboard Mulbera Drummond was again accepted by nearly all the ship's company. The exception was the Second Engineer, Mr Lamb, who on Drummond's first day aboard told her that he didn't want her there. Drummond said Lamb often shouted at her, occasionally swore at her and thus wore her down. Drummond privately nicknamed Lamb the Tiger Cat or just \\"The Tiger\\". On occasion she also encountered passengers who initially did not believe a woman could be a marine engineer. Drummond won them round by competently doing her job. In port in Aden on 11 May 1928 Drummond received an air mail letter telling her that aboard her former ship Anchises on 13 April her friend Malcolm Quayle had died. The letter gave no details of what had happened and she found out none until some time thereafter. 12 years ashore From about 1919 Drummond's sister Jean ran the Queen Victoria Girl's Club at 122 Kennington Road, Lambeth, south London: a job that included a flat at the top of the building. From 1929 Victoria and Frances leased a house almost opposite at 143 Kennington Road, which they named The Studio. Frances worked as a commercial artist and she and Victoria also developed a business, the Golden Fisheries, trading goldfish that they kept in their garden pond and in tanks in the house. From October 1929 Drummond repeatedly sat the Board of Trade examination for Chief Engineer, but every time the examiners failed her. Mr Martin at Dundee continued to support her and eventually in 1936 tackled the examiners, who privately admitted to him that they always failed her because she was a woman. Indeed, to prevent any accusations of unfairness, the Board of Trade Examiners habitually failed all candidates who sat the examinations with her. From 1935 Frances and Victoria's business took them abroad to trade fairs in Leipzig, Prague and Vienna. In March 1938 when German forces occupied Austria in the Anschluss, the two sisters were at a trade fair in Vienna. Drummond photographed Hitler in his motorcade and later described that time in Vienna as very tense, chaotic and dangerous. Philanthropy As a response to their experience, they took it upon themselves to enable several Austrian children to enter the UK as refugees and sponsored them by finding schools, accommodation and paying for their expenses for a year. Source: Gertrude Maiman (1922 - ) one of the children brought over from Vienna. World War II service In 1939 war seemed to grow inevitable so Drummond applied to return to sea as a Second Engineer. Despite her good service on liners of two of the most prestigious companies in the Merchant Navy, and glowing references from numerous superior officers, all her many applications were declined. Therefore, on the eve of World War II she joined Jean and Frances enlisting as Air raid wardens in Lambeth, London. =Har Zion= Model of in the Israeli National Maritime Museum Drummond then tried visiting the Royal Docks in the hope of finding a ship that would take her on. Eventually on such a visit a donkeyman,A donkeyman was a crewman who operated and maintained machinery other than the ship's main engines. His exact responsibilities varied widely between different ships. who had served with her on Mulbera 12 years earlier, recognised Drummond in a caf√©. He and his shipmates advised her that if no British company would take her she should try for a berth on a foreign ship. They introduced her to a representative of Palestine Maritime Lloyd, owned by a group of Jewish businessmen based in Haifa, Palestine. He was sceptical of signing a woman engineer until he saw her papers. Palestine Maritime Lloyd operated mostly coasters of to , but had also one small deep-sea cargo and passenger ship, the (Mount Zion), that which could carry both cargo and 110 passengers. Har Zion needed a new Second Engineer so he immediately offered Drummond a berth at a salary of ¬£41 10s. Har Zion was registered at Famagusta in the British Protectorate of Cyprus. Her officers and crew were a mixture of Arab, Czech, Egyptian, German, Hungarian, Russian, Spanish, and the ship's dog was Polish. She was built in 1907 and by 1940 was in poor condition. Drummond mastered disciplinary problems among the engine room crew and then in drydock in Antwerp completed enough furnace and boiler repairs for Har Zion to pass its Lloyd's Certificate inspection. In Antwerp Har Zion took on a Greek Third Engineer who clashed with Drummond. The ship worked to Beirut, Haifa and back, and on its return trip evacuated the British Consul and part of the British Expeditionary Force from Marseille to Gibraltar. When the ship returned to London in July 1940 Drummond left to get away from the Third Engineer. About a month later, in August 1940, Har Zion was sunk in the Western Approaches by the , with the loss of 36 of the 37 people aboard. =Bonita= In August 1940 a Panamanian company, Compa√±√≠a Arena Limitada, gave Drummond a berth on its cargo ship at a salary of ¬£46 10s ‚Äî ¬£5 a month more than on Har Zion. Drummond joined her at Fowey in Cornwall where the ship loaded china clay for the USA. Being a neutral ship she was not offered the protection of a place in a convoy. On the morning of Sunday 25 August 1940 Bonita was in the North Atlantic about from land when Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor aircraft attacked. Drummond was on watch and immediately ordered the fireman and greaser to join her on the starting platform ready in case they needed to escape. Near misses from bombs blew all the lagging off the pipes in the engine room and split the main water service pipe feeding the boilers. Fuel oil started leaking from somewhere, hitting Drummond in the face and closing one of her eyes. She ordered her fireman and greaser to open the fuel injectors and main steam throttle to increase speed and then get out of the engine room in case they needed to abandon ship. Drummond remained alone at her post. Bonita had never before exceeded but in 10 minutes Drummond somehow increased speed to . The Master, a Captain Herz from Hungary, used the extra speed to change course sharply and avoid being hit whenever a Condor bombed the ship. The bombs were heavy enough to lift Bonita in the water and cause damage even by near misses. The ship was hit by both and machine-gun fire. Drummond says 25 bombs were dropped; this suggests that six or seven aircraft took part in the attack, which continued for 30‚Äì35 minutes. Bonita continued her crossing without further incident and reached Norfolk, Virginia on 8 September. There Drummond received news that The Studio at 143 Kennington Road had been bombed but Frances and Jean were safe. Aboard Bonita Drummond formed a close friendship with another married man, the First Mate Mr Warner. In a published account of her conduct in the air raid, Warner described Drummond as \\"about the most courageous woman I ever saw\\". Newspapers in Norfolk, VA quoted Captain Herz commending Drummond as \\"one of the most competent engineers ever employed on this vessel\\". In Norfolk, Drummond made friends with a Virginian woman, Mrs Julia Davies, who was engaged in charitable work collecting goods to send to Britain that were in short supply because of the War. Davies engaged Drummond as a speaker at charitable events, and in return directed to Lambeth much of the goods that her charitable network was collecting. At Norfolk Bonita discharged her china clay and loaded scrap iron. The ship made her return crossing via Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she joined an eastbound convoy. The oil-burning ship was unable to stop making black smoke, which made her dangerously conspicuous. When the third or fourth engineer were on watch the ship lost speed and fell behind the convoy. Whenever Drummond was on watch the ship managed to increase speed and regain her station. =Developments ashore= By Christmas 1941 Drummond's sisters Jean and Frances were preparing to move into a flat in Restormel House, Chester Way, Kennington. By 1941 Drummond had qualified as a Panamanian chief engineer. These examinations were a purely written paper, with the gender or status of the candidate not being known to the examiners. By then the Board of Trade had failed her for Chief Engineer 31 times. Due to the needs of war the Board of Trade was now granting Chief Engineer certificates to experienced Second Engineers on the sole basis of an oral examination. However, when Drummond requested this dispensation the Board refused. Because of the dangers of war, the Board patronisingly suggested that Drummond take a shore job as an instructor. Drummond replied firmly that numerous Chief and other engineers with whom she had served had lacked the nerve to cope while under enemy attack, and therefore the best service she could give was as a Chief Engineer at sea. In about April 1941, Drummond learnt that Mrs Davies in Virginia had raised ¬£400 toward the provision of a \\"Victoria A. Drummond Ambulance\\" for the people of Lambeth. In raising funds Davies and a Mrs Leitch had even enlisted the poet Robert Frost to give a public reading of his works. However, what Lambeth needed more was a British Restaurant for people who had been bombed out of their homes. Accordingly, the \\"Victoria A. Drummond Canteen\\" was opened in Westminster Bridge Road near Lambeth North tube station. The canteen served hot meals for sixpence a head and remained open for the remainder of the war. For her courage aboard Bonita Drummond was awarded the MBE and the Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea in July 1941. Her MBE was presented by George VI. =Czikos= In February 1941 Warner and Drummond signed on as Captain and Second Engineer of an old Panamanian steamship, . The ship was in Lisbon so a skeleton crew including Warner and Drummond sailed out to join her on Yeoward Brothers' passenger liner . They sailed Czikos to Gibraltar, where they joined a convoy bound for the Firth of Clyde. About northwest of Ireland a Luftwaffe Fw 200 Condor attacked Czikos. As with Bonita, none of the bombs hit but the near misses damaged the ship. The Condor also machine-gunned the ship, killing a quartermaster at the helm and wounding two other crewmen. =Manchester Port= Manchester Liners' , on which Drummond was Fifth Engineer in 1942 In April 1942 Drummond joined Manchester Liners' in Liverpool as Fifth Engineer. The ship was unkempt and filthy, including the galley, the food was ill-served and the Master, Captain Davis, seemed permanently drunk. Nevertheless, Manchester Port was made Commodore Ship for convoy ON 89 to North America. The ship survived the crossing and on 17 May loaded dynamite at Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec. On 20 May the ship reached Halifax to join an eastbound convoy. Drummond reported Davis for drunkenness and on 21 May he was removed under police escort, replaced by a Captain Middleton. Manchester Port joined convoy HX 191, which left Halifax on 24 May and reached Liverpool on 6 June. The ship discharged her explosive cargo in Manchester and Drummond returned to her sisters in Lambeth. =Danae II= At the end of August 1942 Drummond and Warner joined the cargo steamer at Boston, Lincolnshire as First Mate and Second Engineer. The ship was owned by the Ministry of War Transport and managed by Ambrose, Davies and Matthews, who had chosen someone else for Second Engineer. The Third and Fourth Engineers were unqualified. The Master, Captain Cheek, the Chief Engineer and either the third or fourth engineer were all heavy drinkers. Drummond called Danae II \\"The worst ship I ever sailed in\\". The ship steamed north via North Shields in Northumberland to Methil Docks in Fife. There Cheek tried to give Drummond her notice on medical grounds, but doctor ashore stopped him. When the ship reached Aultbea in Ross Cheek sacked Drummond with 24 hours' notice, although she had signed on for two years. The firemen, greasers and donkeyman all refused to sail without Drummond, and so did the deck crew. Her friend Warner, however, refused to leave the ship, leaving Drummond feeling betrayed. Drummond reported the mismanagement of Danae II to the MoWT and Ambrose, Davies and Matthews. Cheek's solicitors threatened to sue Drummond for defamation, but no action followed. =Perseus= At the end of January 1943 Drummond returned to Blue Funnel, signing on as refrigeration engineer on the refrigerated cargo ship . Again Drummond was beset by a hostile Second Engineer always being rude to her, giving her extra work and trying to prevent her from getting shore leave. Perseus circumnavigated the World westbound from Liverpool via New York, Cuba, the Panama Canal, Australia, South Africa, Sierra Leone and Gibraltar, returning to Liverpool in September 1943. In July 1943 the ship visited Cape Town, where Drummond was able to go ashore and visit her friend Malcolm Quayle's grave outside the city. After an eight-month voyage Drummond did not want to return to sea immediately. After leaving Perseus in September 1943 she returned to her sisters in Lambeth, where Restormel House had been damaged by a bomb but their flat remained intact. Drummond did not seek another position at sea until January 1944. =Karabagh= In April 1944 Drummond signed on as Assistant Engineer of a diesel ship, the Baltic Trading Company's oil tanker , with which she sailed on an Arctic convoy to Onega in the USSR. On return to England in May 1944 Drummond signed onto Karabagh again as Fourth Engineer. After D-Day on 6 June 1944 the tanker spent three months shuttling supplies such as aviation spirit across the English Channel for the Invasion of Normandy, initially from the Solent and later from Newport, Wales. Drummond formed a friendship with Karabaghs Master, a man from Northern Ireland called Captain Charlton. In Newport the two took occasional trips ashore, and once on a visit to Tintern Abbey he proposed to her. She did not accept, and later explained that this was because both he and she had short tempers. Post-war years After the War the bomb-damaged Restormel House was demolished. In December 1945 and January 1946 Drummond's sisters Jean and Frances moved into 160 Kennington Road, which they named Tresco. , one of two Blue Funnel ships whose completion Drummond supervised at Caledon's yard in Dundee In April 1946 Blue Funnel appointed Drummond to return to Caledon in Dundee to supervise the completion of the sister ships and , which she did until July. Karabagh had given Drummond enough experience to take her Second Engineer's motor examination. She passed in May 1946 on her second attempt. In September Drummond returned to sea as Second Engineer, now with Cunard-White Star Line. She worked as a relief Second Engineer, serving for short periods on Cunard cargo ships until January 1947. After leaving Cunard she served on the MoWT's Type C1 ship for five months, signing on in May 1947 at Fowey in Cornwall, leaving in September in Philadelphia and returning to Britain as a passenger on Cunard's . For the next four years Drummond worked as Chief or Second Engineer for short periods for various shipping companies. They included Elsie Beth, which she joined at Barry, South Wales in August 1949 and left in Dublin in December. The voyage took Drummond back to Onega in the USSR, where she had previously been in 1944 on Karabagh. In February 1952 Drummond returned to supervising shipbuilding in Scotland. The Phocian Ship Agency sent her to the Burntisland Shipbuilding Company in Fife to oversee building of the until the ship was launched in September. Drummond would have liked further jobs supervising shipbuilding, but instead Phocian offered her a berth on the . She spent a month on Markab as Second Engineer in October and November 1952, then returned to the ship as Chief Engineer in January 1953. This turned out to be a year-long voyage that included the Suez Canal, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the US, the Caribbean, Argentina, Brazil, Cape Verde and ended in Antwerp in January 1954. Drummond next spent another three years serving for short periods for various shipping companies. Then in April 1957 in London she signed on Monarch Steamship Company's . This turned out to be a six-month voyage: across the Atlantic to the US, through the Panama Canal, across the Pacific to Japan, south to Fiji, north to British Columbia and back through the Panama Canal, back across the Atlantic and ending in Liverpool in November 1957. Drummond returned home to Kennington Road until May 1958, when she began a two-month voyage as the engineer of an old motor yacht, My Adventuress, from Southampton to Istanbul. The engine was unreliable and Drummond's relationship with the owner and his family was strained. Thereafter she stayed ashore in Kennington for another year. Jebshun Shipping Company =Grelrosa / Shantae= Drummond spent her final three years at sea as a Chief Engineer with the Jebshun Shipping Company of Hong Kong. Her first Jebshun ship was the former Empire ship Grelrosa, which Drummond joined in Garston, Merseyside, Liverpool in July 1959. The ship had been laid up for 18 months and needed extensive work to pass its Lloyd's inspection. Grelrosa steamed via the Suez Canal and Singapore to Japan, China and Hong Kong, where Jebshun renamed her Shantae. As Shantae in 1960 the ship sailed to Malaysia and Thailand. In February 1960 in Bangkok Port the ship loaded a flammable mixed cargo of rice, firewood, paper, cotton, palm husks, charcoal, flour and palm oil, all carelessly and chaotically packed into the holds. On top of this, 580 head of live buffalo were crammed on as deck cargo. En route to Hong Kong on 1 March the cargo in number 2 hold caught fire. Drummond provided steam to smother and contain the fire, but this depleted the ship's water supply which was needed to make steam to power the main engine. Shantae reached Hong Kong on 3 March, where the port's fire service used carbon dioxide gas to extinguish the fire. The ship returned to sea 11 days later, trading to Chinese ports including Tsingtao. Drummond signed off at Hong Kong in mid-April. =Shun Fung= Drummond's next Jebshun vessel was the Park ship Shun Fung, which she joined in Kristiansand, Norway in September 1960. This was another steamship that had been laid up and needed work to make her reliable. Drummond served on her for 14 months, sailing via the Suez Canal to Japan and China, then via Durban to West Africa, back to Hong Kong, then to India, and back via Singapore and Chinese ports to Hong Kong, where she signed off in November 1961. =Santa Granda= Drummond's final Jebshun ship, and the final vessel of her career, was the Liberty ship Santa Granda. Only 10 days after signing off Shun Fung in Hong Kong she signed on Santa Granda for six months. She found Santa Granda to be in very poor condition: rusty, dirty and in poor repair. The governor, a vital piece of safety equipment, was missing from the engine. Santa Granda worked to Shanghai and then Basuo on Hainan Island, where it loaded iron ore in December 1961. The ship left port on 8 December, and by midnight was struggling against a strong headwind. The next day water was found in the Number one hold bilge, which took an hour and a half to pump out. On 11 December the Number one hold bilge again needed pumping out, which took an hour and three-quarters. From 12 December the Number one hold bilge needed pumping continuously. Finally on 13 December the Master and Drummond inspected the Number One hold. They found about 10 frames adrift, a plate near the bulkhead split either side of the frame, and frames corroded through at the bottom and broken across. With the motion of the ship, plates and frames were moving past each other and friction was heating the metal. If a plate failed and flooded Number One hold, the Number One bulkhead would be likely to fail. In that case, and laden with dense iron ore, Santa Granda would be likely to sink within a very few minutes. Santa Granda initially made for Shanghai, until the Number One Hold's bulkhead began to buckle. Then the Master put the ship about for Whampoa on the Pearl River Delta, arriving on 17 December. After the iron ore was unloaded, ship surveyors allowed the damaged Santa Granda to leave to make for Hong Kong for repairs. Christmas was spent in Hong Kong, with Drummond arguing against Jebshun representatives who wanted to postpone many of the repairs essential to make the ship safe. Drummond began engine and boiler repairs, and on 29 December the ship moved to drydock in Kowloon. A fortnight later Santa Granda returned to sea, continuing to take cargoes of iron ore from Basuo to other Chinese ports. On 25 March 1962 Drummond advised that the ship was still in too poor a condition to pass its forthcoming Lloyd's inspection. Two days later Santa Granda reached Hong Kong, where Jebshun told the Master they would transfer the insurance from Lloyd's to a French company. Drummond believed this was to avoid inspection, and on 30 March she gave the Master her notice that she would quit the ship the next day. Then Drummond spent 10 days in Hong Kong and visited friends in Japan before returning to London and retirement. Retirement Drummond and her two sisters spent the next 12 years living at 160 Kennington Road. She attended annual meetings of the Institute of Marine Engineers (now IMarEST) and wrote her life story. In the early 1970s Drummond grew less mobile and more dependent on Jean and Frances. In 1974 she fell out of bed, broke her leg and was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital. Soon Jean and Frances were admitted to the same hospital, where they died within two days of each other. Drummond recovered physically but her state of mind deteriorated and she was discharged to St George's Retreat, a church-run nursing home at Ditchling Common in East Sussex. She died there on Christmas Day 1978, and is buried at Megginch Castle beside her parents and sisters. In a career spanning 40 years Drummond made 49 ocean-going voyages. She persevered with her career through hardship and some discrimination, doing the hard physical work of the engine room, managing the engine room crew and at times enduring prejudice and discrimination from some of her immediate superiors. However, she won acceptance and support from most of her fellow-officers and near-universal support and loyalty from crewmen.  Commemoration  She is commemorated by a Victoria Drummond Room at the IMarEST headquarters in London. Her biography, The Remarkable Life of Victoria Drummond ‚Äì Marine Engineer, was written by her niece, Cherry Drummond, 16th Baroness Strange. In 2013 Drummond was featured in an exhibition 'Women in Science' showcasing the legacy of some remarkable Scottish women scientists at the National Library of Scotland. Abertay University has a blue plaque on its Old College building,commemorating her time spend there (when it was Dundee Institute of Technology) training to be an engineer. The plaque features on the Dundee Women's Trail and Dundee Global Trail. In 2018 she was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.http://www.engineeringhalloffame.org/listing-9.html Notes References Sources 1894 births 1978 deaths British Merchant Navy officers British women in World War II British marine engineers Members of the Order of the British Empire People associated with Dundee Drummon, Victoria Scottish engineers Patternmakers (industrial) Scottish women engineers Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame inductees Women's Engineering Society Members of the Women's Engineering Society Women engineers Marine engineers 20th-century engineers ","title":"Victoria Drummond"},{"id":"1844690","text":"Alfapet was the original Swedish name for the popular word game Scrabble.An edition from the 1990s.

He first became known as one of the core members of the British avant-rock group Henry Cow, which he formed with Fred Frith in 1968. After the demise of Henry Cow, he participated in numerous bands and projects, eventually concentrating on composing contemporary music and performing as an improviser. Biography Tim Hodgkinson was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire in England on 1 May 1949, and was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated in social anthropology from Cambridge in 1971, but chose to pursue a musical career instead. His interest in anthropology, however, remained and he drew on it later during a series of study trips to Siberia. =Henry Cow= While still at university, Hodgkinson and fellow student Fred Frith formed the seminal avant-rock group Henry Cow in 1968. Hodgkinson remained with Henry Cow as one of the band's core members until their demise in 1978 and composed a number of their musical pieces, most notably, \\"Living in the Heart of the Beast\\" (recorded on their 1975 album, In Praise of Learning), and \\"Erk Gah\\" (never formally recorded, but live versions appearing in The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set). Henry Cow was the foundation of Hodgkinson's musical education, and it was an opportunity for him to work closely with other instrumentalists and develop new musical landscapes. After Henry Cow split, Hodgkinson and fellow band member Chris Cutler compiled The Henry Cow Book, a collection of documents and information about the band, published in 1981. In November 1973, Hodgkinson (and other members of Henry Cow) participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield's Elements DVD. =Other projects= In 1980 Hodgkinson formed The Work, a post-punk band with guitarist-composer Bill Gilonis, bassist Mick Hobbs and drummer Rick Wilson. At the same time Hodgkinson and Gilonis formed the independent record label, Woof Records. Over the next few years, The Work toured Europe. After performing at a Rock in Opposition festival in Bonn with vocalist Catherine Jauniaux in 1982, the band and Jauniaux recorded Slow Crimes (1982) for the Woof label. Later that year, with a slightly altered line-up of Hodgkinson, Gilonis, Amos and Chris Cutler, they performed in Japan. A concert in Osaka in June 1982 was recorded with a cassette recorder halfway down the hall and was later cleaned up and released on an LP Live in Japan (1982). After the Japanese tour, The Work disbanded but reformed again in 1989 with the original line-up to record two industrial/noise albums, Rubber Cage (1989) and See (1992). In February 1987 Hodgkinson toured with South African band Kalahari Surfers, playing at the \\"Rote Lieder DDR\\" Festival of Political Songs. In 1990 Hodgkinson and Ken Hyder, a Scottish percussionist and improviser, who had been performing together since 1978 (and used to be called Shams), toured Siberia, Soviet Far East and the heart of USSR (Moscow, Leningrad) as a duo under the banner \\"Friendly British Invasion‚Ñ¢: In Search for the Soviet Sham(an)s\\" ‚Äì probably the longest tour produced at the time independently from major Soviet concert officials (by distant Far-Eastern member of the Soviet Jazz Federation and due to the latter's assistance). Later on, they made many other trips to Russia and study trips to Siberia particularly to make contact with local musicians and ritual specialists. It was during these times that they met shamanic musician Gendos Chamzyryn from Tuva and as a trio, they toured Altay villages in the summer of 1998. Chamzyryn played a variety of traditional Tuvan instruments and used the deep- vocal Kargiraa style of overtone-singing. The success of this \\"shaman\\" project resulted in the formation of K-Space, a band comprising Hodgkinson, Hyder and Chamzyryn. K-Space's name came from Kozyrev-Space, a space/time warp named after Russian astrophysicist Nicolai Kozyrev using a device called Kozyrev's Mirrors. Their music was \\"sham beat\\", which incorporated elements of shamanic culture and jazz. From 1999 they began touring Asia and Europe and have released four CDs since 2002. A free improvisation band Hodgkinson is deeply involved with is Konk Pack. Formed at the Szuenetjel Festival in Budapest in 1997 with Thomas Lehn from Cologne on synthesizer, Roger Turner from London on percussion and Hodgkinson on reeds and prepared guitar, the trio performs a blend of psychedelia, free jazz and electroacoustic improvisation. In 1999 they released a CD of live recordings The Big Deep and made further CDs in 2001, 2005, 2010 and 2013. In 2005 Konk Pack toured the United Kingdom with Lol Coxhill replacing Thomas Lehn. In 2007 they toured The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany with the original line-up. As an improviser, Tim Hodgkinson performed with many musicians over the years, including Lol Coxhill, Fred Frith, Chris Cutler, Tom Cora, Lindsay Cooper, John Zorn, Evan Parker, Catherine Jauniaux and Charles Hayward. In December 2006, Cutler, Frith and Hodgkinson performed together at The Stone in New York City, their first concert performance since Henry Cow's demise in 1978. From 1983 to 1985 Hodgkinson managed the Cold Storage Recording Studios in Brixton, London, producing records for Fred Frith's Skeleton Crew, Peter Blegvad and others. He has written a book on the anthropology of music and contributed to periodicals such as Contemporary Music Review, Musicworks, Musica/Realta, and Resonance on music and technology, ethnomusicology, improvisation and other topics. In 2016 his book Music and the Myth of Wholeness ‚Äì Toward a New Aesthetic Paradigm was published by MIT Press. Hodgkinson appeared in Nicolas Humbert and Werner Penzel's 1990 documentary film on Fred Frith, Step Across the Border, rehearsing with Frith at Hodgkinson's home in Brixton, London in December 1988. Tim Hodgkinson's first solo album was Splutter in 1986, consisting of improvisations on alto and baritone saxophones and clarinet, sometimes accompanied by electronics, sometimes multi-tracked. He followed it up with KLARNT in 2008, an album of eleven solo clarinet improvisations. =Composition= Beginning in the early 1990s Hodgkinson again applied himself to composition, initially returning to the approach developed in his Henry Cow period. In 1994 he released Each in Our Own Thoughts, a collection of pieces including his first string quartet, and a piece written for Henry Cow in 1976 (\\"Hold to the Zero Burn, Imagine\\"), which was performed at the time (as \\"Erk Gah\\") but never recorded in the studio. When finally recorded in 1993 he brought in three other members of the original band: Chris Cutler, Lindsay Cooper and Dagmar Krause. A further piece \\"Numinous Pools For Mental Orchestra\\" was realised entirely with MIDI-instruments. However his work as an improviser by now made him far more aware of the limitations of his current way of writing. An encounter with Iancu Dumitrescu and the Romanian Spectralist school provided a turning point, after which he began to find new ways of developing musical structures out of the behaviours of sounds and unstable acoustic systems. This became evident with the release of the CD Pragma in 1998, on which the pieces are realised on a computer using a mix of live instruments and samples. In 2000 Hodgkinson made Sang, a collection of new compositions. The first and third pieces were performed by Hodgkinson alone, playing viola, piano, alto saxophone, percussion and MIDI instruments; the second piece GUSHe, which he has often performed live, is for clarinet with electronic accompaniment, while the last, M√Ä was performed by Federica Santoro (singing) with a montage made from recordings of other pieces of Hodgkinson's (a rehearsal with Banda Municipal de Barcelona and fragments of his second String Quartet). Hodgkinson then released Sketch of Now on the Mode label in 2006. It comprises three compositions for the Romanian Hyperion Ensemble, of which Hodgkinson conducted two and played on one (conducted by Iancu Dumitrescu); two compositions performed by Hodgkinson: one for bass clarinet and tape, one for computer-modified cello and electric guitar; one piece for two clarinets, one doubling on bass, and piano, performed by Isabelle Duthoit, Jacques Di Donato and Pascale Berthelot. The track, \\"Fragor\\" appears in the 2010 film Shutter Island, but was not featured on the soundtrack CD. This was followed up in 2014 with Onsets, a second CD for the Mode label. Five of the six pieces are performed by the Hyperion Ensemble, and one piece by the New York based ensemble Ne(x)tworks. Hodgkinson conducts all the pieces and also plays bass clarinet on ‚ÄúUlaaraar.‚Äù In 2015, he released CUTS on the Freeform Association label, which groups together three compositions having a mathematical approach in their structure. ‚ÄúHard without I‚Äù is performed by the composer on solo bass clarinet. ‚ÄúOn Earth‚Äù is Hodgkinson's second piece to be performed by Ne(x)tworks, this time with Joan La Barbara. ‚ÄúAnank√©‚Äù is performed by the Hyperion Ensemble. The latter two pieces are conducted by the composer. Music Tim Hodgkinson (left) and Chris Cutler in Schiphorst, Germany, 6 July 2008. Tim Hodgkinson's music displays many personalities: from the serious and complex musical structures of Henry Cow to the angry post-punk crash of guitars in The Work; from free- wheeling improvisations with Konk Pack to the contemporary classical music of his recordings for the Mode label. The instruments he plays are principally reeds (clarinet, bass clarinet, and alto saxophone), but with Henry Cow he mostly played keyboards, and with The Work, K-Space and Konk Pack he played and plays lap steel guitar. He also sang in The Work. For his solo recordings he added viola, percussion, sampling, sequencing and MIDI. Hodgkinson is a self-taught musician. He started formal piano and clarinet lessons as a child, but quickly abandoned them. He then began writing down music, initially using a keyboard but soon switched to writing the sounds in his head directly onto paper. To assist with this process, he studied sight-singing with Andras Ranki at Morley College, London in 1983.

It is known for being the birthplace of the Tudors of Penmynydd, which became the House of Tudor. The population according to the United Kingdom Census 2011 was 465. The community includes the village of Star. Description Penmynydd is located on Anglesey off the north west coast of Wales, situated on a slight hill on the B5420 road between Menai Bridge and Llangefni, at . The Royal Mail postcode begins LL61 with a community population taken at the 2011 census of 465. Edward Greenly gave the name of the village to the Monian ‚ÄòPenmynydd Zone of Metamorphism', a Precambrian blueschist terrane stretching along the hill from Red Wharf Bay to Newborough; the blueschist event has been dated to about 550 million years ago.M. F. Howells, British Regional Geology, Wales, British Geological Survey 2007 When Welsh nobleman Rhys ap Tudur was executed in 1412, lands of the Penmynydd family were forfeited. The village is notable for its early 17th century almshouses. The bwthyn at Minffordd was the first place on Anglesey used for Nonconformist worship in the early 18th century,.http://www.capeli.org.uk/uploads/newsletter_40.pdf The village includes the Neuadd Lwyd, a former Victorian rectory that was converted into a country-house hotel. A radio communication transmission mast was installed in 2002 a few yards north of the village at the top of the hill. The Tudor Family Effigy of Goronwy ap Tudur at St Gredifael's Church, Penmynydd Penmynydd was the home of the Tudors of Penmynydd, from which sprang the House of Tudor. In the 14th century, a resident of Penmynydd, Tudur ap Goronwy, had five sons, of whom one, Maredudd ap Tudur, was father of the Owen Tudor who joined Henry V of England's army and subsequently established himself at court. After Henry died, his widow, Catherine of Valois, married Owen Tudor in secret around 1429 and had three sons. Their grandson, Henry Tudor, successfully claimed the crown of England, becoming King Henry VII. The village contains the Grade II* listed building Plas Penmynydd. The house was originally built in 1576 by Richard Owen Tudor, a representative of the senior line of the Tudors of Penmynydd. It was sold following the death of his descendant, another Richard Owen Tudor who had been Sheriff of Anglesey in 1657, and the house passed through several families. It was listed on 2 May 1952. In the 2000s, it was restored by Richard Cuthbertson and featured on the BBC Wales television series Hidden Houses of Wales in 2010. Governance The community was part of the Llanfihangel Ysgeifiog electoral ward for elections to the Isle of Anglesey County Council. Following the 2012 Isle of Anglesey electoral boundary changes Penmynydd was transferred to a new multi-councillor ward of Aethwy.

Both musicians are of the singer-songwriter style. Their self-titled debut was released in 2003, spawning a top ten song and three wide release singles. Across the Sky's music is a style combining light rock, pop, and folk. The group toured and recorded for two years under the Word Records Label before disbanding in 2005 when both artists decided to pursue different career paths. Early life Ben Kolarcik's earliest performances were in his home church of Southeast Christian Church, in Louisville. These experiences led him to the decision to be a full time independent artist. After high school, he married Melissa Strandell. Opportunities came about to perform consistently, nationally and internationally, including such places as Australia, Costa Rica, New Zealand, and Poland. A self-taught guitarist, he also learned to play piano and lap dulcimer. Kolarcik references his influences as being The Beatles, The Police and Jeff Buckley to Keith Green, Rick James, Jimi Hendrix and Rich Mullins. Justin Unger had similar experiences. Unger was raised on Christian music. Justin began playing piano at age 10, and trumpet in the school band. Unger began writing music at 17 for his grandfather, who was a pastor. He also started a Christian band called \\"Emmaus,\\" performing as lead vocalist on the songs that his grandfather and he had written. Musical career Across the Sky was formed when solo artists, Ben Kolarcik and Justin Unger, who were under consideration by Word Records, met and began collaborations in Nashville. Both artists had a history of performance and music ministry in their hometowns and in regional tours. After deciding on becoming a duo act, the pair sat down to work on music together. After composing 50 or so titles, they settled on 12 for their first album. The pair was assisted along the way by such notable Contemporary Christian musicians and writers as Cindy Morgan, Scott Krippayne, Matthew Gerrard, Jeff Borders, Kyle Matthews and Tony Wood. Their self-titled album was released in 2003. Much of the music on this project is artist composed. During their run they toured extensively around the US and internationally. They toured with major established artists such as Michael W. Smith, Mark Schultz, Avalon, and MercyMe. Their debut album and tours garnered the duo a GMA Dove Award nomination for New Artist of the Year in 2004. Also in 2004 their song \\"Masquerade\\" was included on the Platinum Album WOW Hits 2004, an annual compilation CD of top artists of the previous year. While still together they received radio play throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, and Australia. During this period, their single \\"Found By You\\" peaked at number 5 on the AC Christian Charts in the United States. Across the Sky disbanded in 2005. The songs \\"Broken World\\" and \\"Give it all Away\\" were released as singles and received airplay in the US and radio stations in Australia, Canada, South America, and Europe. Their song \\"Everywhere She Goes\\" was featured in the first season of \\"One Tree Hill\\" on the WB network. Personal lives After the disbandment of Across the Sky in 2005, Justin Unger moved to Prescott, AZ with his wife and children where he is a music minister at an alternative style megachurch called The Heights. Unger continues song-writing and composition. He released a solo CD titled \\"Disengage\\" on October 30, 2007, followed by 4 other albums in 2009, 2012, and 2016. Ben Kolarcik resides in Phoenix, Arizona with his wife and children where he has pursued a career as a writer and composer. Kolarcik tours as well.

She was the daughter of Katarzyna Sobieska, who was the sister of Jan III Sobieski, the king of The Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Her father was W≈Çadys≈Çaw Dominik Zas≈Çawski, a Polish nobleman of Ruthenian stock of the house of Ostrogski, one of the richest magnates in Poland. Teofila Ludwika Zas≈Çawska was an heiress of the Ostrogski family, one of the great Ruthenian princely families of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. She was the fifth ordinate of the Ostrogski Ordination (one of the largest landed estates in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth). Her father was the third, and one of her sons would become the sixth ordinate of it. Life Baran√≥w owned consecutively with both of her husbands (1677‚Äì1720), where Teofila lived with her children Teofila Ludwika Zas≈Çawska married the Great Crown Hetman of the Commonwealth, Dymitr Jerzy Wi≈õniowiecki in 1671, and after his death in 1682, married Prince J√≥zef Karol Lubomirski (Joseph Carl Lubomirski) in 1683. Upon her first husband's death, she inherited holdings that included Baran√≥w Sandomierski Castle, which had become her main residence in 1677. After the death of her brother, Aleksander Janusz Zas≈Çawski in 1673, she became the only heir to one of the largest estates in the Commonwealth, the Ostrogski Ordination. This ordination was the largest one in the Volhyn, accounting for ‚Äì about a third of the Volhynian Voivodeship ‚Äì with over 1,000 settlements, including several dozen towns. As a result of her marriage to Lubomirski, the large landed estates of the Ostrogski Ordination in Poland were transferred to the Lubomirski family. The combined fortune of Zas≈Çawskis and Lubomirskis would become for a time the largest fortune in the Commonwealth. Lubomirskis owned several palaces where they lived, all of them designed or redesigned by the royal architect Tylman van Gameren, including palaces in Lublin, Warsaw, Lubart√≥w, and the Baran√≥w Sandomierski Castle in Baran√≥w. The Baran√≥w Sandomierski Castle with arcaded courtyard, and surrounded by massive gardens, became commonly known as the \\"little Wawel\\". She and Lubomirski had three children, Prince Aleksander Dominik Lubomirski, Princess Teresa Lubomirska, and Princess Marianna Lubomirska.

There are 145 permanent residents as of 1 January 2016.\\"Danmarks Statistik.\\" Retrieved 23 May 2016. Anholt is seven miles (11 km) long and about four miles (6.4 km) wide at its widest, and covers an area of . Anholt is part of Norddjurs Municipality in Region Midtjylland. Before the 2007 municipal reform, it was in Gren√• Municipality. The western fifth of Anholt consists of hilly moraine country, while the eastern four-fifths of the island consist of mostly flat raised seabed with some low hills, former wind-blown sand dunes. Only the western moraine hills are inhabited. The eastern part, called \\"√òrkenen\\" (The Desert) is treeless; the government has protected the area and permits no building there. The desert has never been ploughed. For this reason the original stone age topography from when the glaciation ceased, at the end of the last ice age 10,000 years ago, is still visible in many places. This includes former shorelines inland, consequences of different sea levels over time. The unploughed features of The Desert are unique for Denmark, as well as for this part of Europe. The inhabited part of Anholt has two villages, The Harbour and Anholt Town, inland. There are also 300 to 400 summer houses, some of them rentals. √òrkenen (The Desert) with sparse vegetation, covers 80 percent of the island.  Terrain The western part of Anholt is a moraine landscape. The small village is situated in the middle of the landscape, whereas the harbour (built 1902) is at the northwestern tip of the island. The eastern part of the island is known as √òrkenen (the desert). This desert-like area is the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The desertification was caused by deforestation. It is not a true desert, but a lichen heath, with some 300 to 400 types of lichen. Great efforts are being taken to preserve the scenery and prevent the effects of erosion. In 1995/6 the Danish Heath Society cleared large areas in the south part of √òrkenen of mountain pine. On Totten, the eastern tip of the island, there is one of the biggest colonies of seals in Denmark. This part of the island is closed to visitors. =Lighthouse= Bascule light at Skagen Dangerous reefs and shoals surround Anholt. Consequently, in 1560 King Frederick II ordered the erection of bascule lights at Skagen, Anholt, and Kullen Lighthouse to mark the main route through Danish waters from the North Sea to the Baltic. Despite the bascule light, on 10/11 November 1716 the 60-gun third-rate , Captain Robert Johnson, ran ashore on the island of Anholt during heavy weather and was wrecked. Most of the people on her were saved. An ecological consequence of the introduction of the bascule light was the deforestation of Anholt for firewood, resulting in Anholt's \\"desert\\". By the time of the switch after 1600 to imported pit coal, considerable damage had been done. In 1785 a 35-meter tower was erected with an open fire. In 1805 a lantern replaced the fire and in 1838 a mirror was added. Then in early 1842 a flashing light replaced the fixed light, and a lightship was towed to a station of the Knobben, off Anholt. Around the mid-19th century there was also a floating light stationed several miles out from the lighthouse, near the end of the several miles long reef. This floating light operated from May to December. Today's tower dates to 1881, at which time an oil lamp replaced the fire. At one time there was also a beacon fire in the middle of the east coast of the island, but that has disappeared. The present Anholt Fyr (lighthouse) belongs to the Danish Maritime Safety Administration and has the status of a protected historical landmark. History Anholt has been settled since the New Stone Age and one may still find flint flakes on the ‚Äúdesert‚Äù. There have been some Old Stone Age finds as well. The island has never been the object of systematic archaeological investigation, so no Bronze Age remnants have been found. Some Viking finds have been made. The 1231 land register of King Valdemar II shows that the king owned a house or a hunting lodge on the S√∏nderbjerg, the island's highest point. Anholt was thus property of the crown. In 1441 the island was under the administration of Kal√∏ Lehn, headed by Otto Nielsen Rosenkrands. Anholt belonged to the parish of Morup in the Danish province of Halland until the middle of the 16th century, when a church was built on the island itself.Store Danske Encyklop√¶di, CD-ROM edition, entry Anholt, 2004. The island remained Danish when Denmark ceded Halland to Sweden in 1645. A story claims that a negotiator had left a glass of beer placed over the island on the map during the peace negotiations. A more plausible explanation is that Swedish forces had not conquered the fairly remote island and had little interest in it. In 1668 Anholt was sold to the tax farmer Peder Jensen Grove. Six years later his widow married Hans Rostgaard of Krogerup and the island then came at the hands of the Rostgaard von der Maase family. Most recently, lawyer Jens Christian Rostgaard von der Maase, of Copenhagen, has owned the greater and protected part of the island. =British occupation (1809‚Äì1814)= Early in the Gunboat War (part of the Napoleonic Wars), the Danish authorities shut off the lighthouse on Anholt. On 5 December 1808 the bomb ketch was wrecked on the Anholt Reef while trapped in floating ice; the Danes rescued all her crew and immediately made them prisoners of war. Proselyte had stationed herself off the island on 9 November 1808 to carry a light for the safety of passing convoys. Following the loss of Proselyte, on 18 May 1809 the 64-gun third rate , under Captain Askew Paffard Hollis, and the 36-gun frigate captured the island. A party of seamen and marines under the command of Captain William Selby of Owen Glendower, with the assistance of Captain Edward Nicolls of the Standards marines, landed. The Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp but ineffectual resistance that killed one marine and wounded two; the garrison then capitulated. The British took immediate possession of the island. The principal objective of the mission was to restore the lighthouse on the island to its pre-war state to facilitate the movement of British men of war and merchantmen navigating the dangerous seas there. The Danes, upon hearing of their defeat, attempted to retake the island and launched an expedition. However, the battle of Anholt resulted in a significant British victory and the Danes made no further attempts to recapture the island. There is a monument commemorating the battle in Anholt village. While captain of , Francis Austen visited Anholt in 1812 and wrote about it to his sister, the novelist Jane Austen. He described the lighthouse in some detail and also gave some impressions of the island: On 28 February 1812, the 16-gun brig was wrecked on Anholt, but without loss of life, as the British garrison on the island were able to rescue the crew. The British held Anholt until the Treaty of Kiel, which was signed on 15 January 1814, ended the war and returned the islands to Denmark. In the 1940s a British visitor heard children reciting a verse which they did not understand the meaning of: \\"\\". The ditty, it turned out, had been a nursery rhyme brought to the island by British soldiers during the Napoleonic wars. =World War I= Denmark remained neutral during the war and neither side ventured into the Kattegat until late in the war when the British laid a minefield in the path of German merchantmen. During the operation the mines managed to sink 10 German trawlers off Anholt. =World War II= There were several World War II sinkings off Anholt. *On 11 April 1940, the British submarine torpedoed and sank the German steamer (2,593grt) thirteen miles (19 km) south of Anholt. Sealion fired two torpedoes, one of which found its mark. *On 1 May 1940, the British submarine , (Lt.Cdr. R.J. Burch, RN), torpedoed and sank the German troop transport (6,097 GRT) and torpedoed and damaged the German troop transport (8,580 GRT) in the Kattegat about north of Anholt. Bahia Castillo reached port but was declared a total loss. *On 20 May 1940, the troop transport SS Batavier III, owned by Wm.H. van M√ºller & Co., hit a mine and sank northwest of Anholt. *On 21 April 1945, British bombers sank Ostmark (ex-C√¥te d'Argent, launched 1932 and 3,047 GRT). *On 5 May 1945, a RAF bomber sank the . The submarine was on the surface with three other submarines when the attack occurred. The Germans shot down one of the British bombers; all its crew were lost. All of the crew of U-534 escaped the submarine, but three died of exposure or lung damage in surfacing; lifeboats from a lightship in the vicinity rescued the 49 survivors. On 25 August 1993, U-534 was pulled 220 feet (67 m) to the surface of the Kattegat Sea, 13 miles (20 km) northeast of Anholt Island. After being housed at a museum that later closed, the submarine was moved to the Woodside Ferry Terminal in Liverpool for an exhibition on U-Boats that opened in February 2009. *On 19 April 1945, rockets from eight British and Norwegian Mosquito aircraft sank the German submarine south of Anholt. Thirty-nine of her crew died; four survived. There is a small graveyard on Anholt that holds the remains of five allied airmen. Three are from an Avro Lancaster of 428 (RCAF) Squadron that crashed into the Baltic on 30 August 1944 on a raid to Stettin. Another grave is of Flying Officer Ronald Kenneth Stratford DFM of 460 (RAAF); his Lancaster was also shot down on a raid to Stettin on 30 August 1944. On 15 December a Ju 88 night fighter shot down an Avro Lancaster of 106 Squadron, which had a crew of eight. Only three bodies washed ashore, one of them on Anholt; the others were never recovered. Connections The Anholt Ferry in Grenaa Harbor. A daily ferry from Gren√• on the eastern coast of Jutland takes about three hours to reach Anholt. The ferry detours around the wind farm, which will compensate for the increased fuel consumption in order to maintain sailing schedules.Anholt Havm√∏llepark Anholt.dk. Accessed: 10 December 2011. Anholt has an airport with a grass runway. There are daily flights to Anholt during the summer and weekly flights in the winter. Flights depart from Roskilde Airport on the Danish main island, Zealand, via Copenhagen Air Taxi. The flights also go on to L√¶s√∏ Island, and return to Roskilde from there, via Anholt. One can also fly from Varberg, Sweden, via charter from Varbergs Flygklubb, a flying club. =Port= Anholt port After some years of political debate, construction commenced in 1899 on a fishing harbour for the island. The construction was finished and the port entered service in 1902. The harbour functioned as a safe haven in storms for the vessels fishing in the Kattegat, as well as a home port for Anholt's own fishermen. Today there is a marina at the harbour and the ferry docks here too. In 2003 Anholt celebrated the 100th anniversary of the opening, but one year late. The first rescue facility on the island was established in 1878 at the lighthouse. It was abandoned in 1926. The second rescue facility was built in 1919, but abandoned in 1938. Today there is a rescue vessel stationed at a mole in the harbour. Over the last 200 years over 200 vessels have foundered near Anholt. Tourism Anholt Nordstrand - the sandy, , northern beach with characteristic coastal dunes in the background. 60,000 people visit Anholt each year. From the end of June to the first half of August the harbor is a tourist resort with restaurants and shops. Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and German yachts are among the most common sailing boats seen at Anholt. From the two highest points on the island ‚Äì S√∏nderbjerg (48 m) and Nordbjerg (39 m) ‚Äì one can see Jutland or Sweden on a clear day. Outside the summer season, there are few visitors to Anholt. Currently an effort is made to extend the tourist season via events such as an Anholt Marathon and festivals. Offshore wind farm Anholt Wind Farm - 110, 4.5 MW, Turbines. The ferry passes close by. DONG Energy has built the Anholt Offshore Wind Farm in the Kattegat, between Anholt island and Djursland (on the mainland). It consists of 111 wind turbines and has a nameplate capacity of 400 megawatts (MW). it is Denmark's largest marine wind park, and among the five largest marine wind parks in the world. It provides energy to the island to replace much of the current diesel- powered electricity. The main part of the electricity is distributed to the mainland via a sea cable to Jutland, entering land by the town, Gren√•. Fishermen have been compensated for the loss of fisheries during construction. With the wind farm complete, net fishing is allowed, but trawling is banned inside the park-area. School The school, north of the meeting house, was built in 1917 and enlarged in 1956. It teaches students from kindergarten to year nine. The present church was built in 1819, after the previous one was heavily damaged during the Danish attempt to re-capture the island. There is evidence in the foundations of an even older church. Anholt has a tradition for building houses that include materials from flotsam. Citations References Hahn-Pedersen, Morten (2003) \\"Reports on Baltic Lights - Denmark\\", in Jerzy Litwin (ed.)

The film starred Errol Flynn, Juliette Gr√©co, Trevor Howard, Eddie Albert, Orson Welles, Paul Lukas, Herbert Lom and Gr√©goire Aslan. The film itself was shot on location in French Equatorial Africa. Huston later said Roots of Heaven \\"could have been a very fine film.

Sight and Sound; London Vol. 42, Iss. 1 Filmink called it \\"possibly the first big budget studio film about an eco-terrorist (unless you count Tarzan movies).\\" Plot Set in French Equatorial Africa, the film tells the story of Morel (Trevor Howard), a crusading environmentalist who sets out to preserve the elephants from extinction as a lasting symbol of freedom for all humanity. He is helped by Minna (Juliette Gr√©co), a nightclub hostess, and Forsythe (Errol Flynn), a disgraced British military officer hoping to redeem himself. Cast Errol Flynn as Maj.

In May, Darryl F. Zanuck announced he would produce the film independently for Fox (he had a contract with the studio to make films for them), and wanted John Huston to direct. (This was before the novel had even been published in the US, but it had already sold over 300,000 copies in Europe). Zanuck said the theme of the film was \\"simple... A man comes to the conclusion that if we don't stop killing people we destroy ourselves.\\" And he says, \\"Why not start with our biggest companions on earth, the elephants, whose only enemy is man?\\" He later added: > This picture is really great for us ‚Äì intellectually great. Whether it's > commercially great, whether people will grab on to it, we must wait and see. > If they grab on to a man in love with a bridge, then why shouldn't they grab > on to a man in love with an elephant? Huston said he wanted to direct the novel before Zanuck approached him: > After my experience with Selznick [on A Farewell to Arms] ‚Äì all those > memorandum! ‚Äì I'd sworn never to work with a producer again, but I did want > very much to make this particular film. So we met several times and talked > it through and finally agreed to try it. Huston agreed to direct for a fee he described as \\"slightly higher\\" than $300,000. Regarding the irony of a big game hunter like Huston making a movie about a militant elephant conservationist, Huston said \\"Contrary to prevailing opinion, I never found an elephant big enough to justify the sin of killing one.\\" Zanuck headed to the Belgian Congo in late 1957 to scout locations, and Gary was hired to write the script. =Casting= William Holden was mentioned as a possibility for the lead part of Morel, as was James Mason. Holden wanted to make the film but he was under contract to Paramount, who would not let him make the film unless he signed another contract with them, which he refused to do. The lead role was taken by Trevor Howard. Errol Flynn signed to play a key support role but was given top billing. Flynn left the cast of the play The Master of Thornfield to appear in the movie. (Flynn and John Huston had famously brawled at a Hollywood party over a decade earlier.) Juliette Gr√©co, who had been in Zanuck's version of The Sun Also Rises and since become the producer's lover, was signed as the female lead. Eddie Albert and Paul Lukas rounded out the main cast. Orson Welles signed to do a cameo. The book was eventually published in the US and became a best seller. =Shooting= The film was mostly made on location in Africa over five months, in the Belgian Congo and Chad in the Northern Cameroons, where the elephants were located. The cast and crew suffered from the heat, malaria and other tropical diseases. Temperatures would routinely reach 134 degrees in the day and 95 degrees at night; people had to shower four or five times a night. On some days it would be a four-hour drive to the location and back and all the water had to be flown in. It is the memories of the challenging location that Flynn mentions with affection in his memoirs My Wicked, Wicked Ways (1959). The company reported 900 sick calls from a cast and crew of 120 ‚Äì however Flynn did not fall ill. Juliette Gr√©co contracted a serious illness. \\"I would never make a picture there again\\", said Zanuck of Africa. However he was proud that \\"There is not one dubbed line, transparency plate or process shot in the whole picture.\\" The unit then moved to Paris for studio filming. While there, Gr√©co fell ill with a re-occurrence of her illness. Errol Flynn had a re-occurrence of his malaria, requiring hospitalisation as well. Orson Welles did his part in two days at a Paris studio. His rate was normally $15,000 but he did it gratis in order to repay Zanuck for helping Welles find the funds to complete the movie Othello (1952). Huston later said, \\"I still don't want to have to work with a producer again but if I had to, I'd certainly choose Darryl. He's been very good, co-operative and decent throughout.\\" Huston later said he was \\"completely responsible... for the badness of The Roots of Heaven. I really wanted to make that one and Daryl Zanuck got me everything and everybody I wanted. But I had the screenplay done by someone who had never done one before, and it was bad. By then the cast, crew and me were in Africa; it was too late to turn back, we would have spent a fortune for nothing, so we went ahead and did the best we could.\\"John Huston: As He Was, Is, and Probably Always Will Be By BRIAN ST. PIERRE. New York Times 25 Sep 1966: 121. =Post- production= The movie was edited in London rather than Paris so that Zanuck could be near Gr√©co, who was making a movie there. Reception =Box office= The film earned rentals of $3 million in the United States and Canada and recorded admissions of 1,266,452 in France.1958 French box office figures at Box Office Story =Critical= The Los Angeles Times thought that \\"John Huston may have bitten off more than he could chew in \\"The Roots of Heaven\\", but much of it makes for thoughtful mastication... it sometimes seems too strange to be real.\\" See also List of American films of 1958 References Bibliography Flynn, E.

Early life and education Robert Gottlieb was born to a Jewish familyReimer, Susan (December 16, 2012), \\"The Good Old Days Of The Future Of Publishing\\", Times of Israel. in New York City in 1931 and grew up in Manhattan. During his childhood, he \\"was your basic, garden-variety, ambitious, upwardly mobile, hard-working Jewish boy from Brooklyn. I was bound to go beyond my parents. It was simply the way things were.‚Äù His middle name was given to him in honor of his uncle, Arthur Adams who is now known to have been a Soviet spy.Avid Reader: A Life, p. 313. Gottlieb graduated from Columbia University in 1952, and then spent two years at Cambridge University before joining Simon & Schuster in 1955. Career Gottlieb joined Simon & Schuster in 1955 as an editorial assistant to Jack Goodman, the editor-in- chief.The Paris Review Interviews, Vol. 1, p. 337, New York: Picador, 2006. Within ten years he himself became the editor-in-chief. At that publisher, Gottlieb's most notable discovery, which he edited, was Catch-22, by the then- unknown Joseph Heller. In 1968, Gottlieb along with Nina Bourne and Anthony Schulte, moved to Alfred A. Knopf as editor-in-chief; soon after he became president. He left in 1987 to succeed William Shawn as editor of The New Yorker, staying in that position until 1992. After his departure from The New Yorker, Gottlieb returned to Alfred A. Knopf as editor ex officio. Gottlieb has been a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, and The New York Times Book Review, and has been the dance critic for The New York Observer since 1999. He is the author of biographies of George Balanchine, Sarah Bernhardt, and the family of Charles Dickens, as well as of a collection of his critical essays. A Certain Style, Gottlieb's lavishly illustrated book about the plastic handbags of which he was a major collector, was published by Alfred A. Knopf. He edited three major anthologies: Reading Jazz, Reading Dance, and (with Robert Kimball) Reading Lyrics. Gottlieb suffered some ignominy for rejecting A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, a book that later won the Pulitzer Prize when it was published posthumously after the author's suicide. Gottlieb's autobiography, Avid Reader: A Life, was published in September 2016.Alter, Alexandra (September 23, 2016), \\"Robert Gottlieb: Avid Reader, Reluctant Writer\\", The New York Times.

In a 1994 interview with The Paris Review, Gottlieb described his need to \\"surrender\\" to a book. \\"The more you have surrendered,\\" he said, \\"the more jarring its errors appear. I read a manuscript very quickly, the moment I get it. I usually won't use a pencil the first time through because I'm just reading for impressions.

The origins of the Todd River are in the MacDonnell Ranges, where it flows past the Telegraph Station, almost through the centre of Alice Springs, through Heavitree Gap at the southern end of Alice Springs and continuing on for some distance, passing through the western part of the Simpson Desert, as it becomes a tributary of the Hale River, and eventually flowing into Lake Eyre in South Australia.Todd River - A Rare Occurrence The indigenous Arrernte people know this river as Lhere Mparntwe (pronounced ler- ra m-barn-twa). The Todd is in a very arid part of Australia and has zero to very low flow during 95% of the year. When it does flow, it carries a heavy sediment load picked up from the grazing land around the Bond Springs homestead which lends its waters a milky chocolate colour and renders them completely opaque. The Todd River's English name, and that of its tributary, the Charles River, were given by surveyor W. W. Mills, after Charles Todd, then South Australian Superintendent of Telegraphs and Postmaster General of South Australia, who was largely responsible for the construction of the Overland Telegraph Line.Todd River Northern Territory Government Place Names Register Retrieved 9 June 2020.Charles River Northern Territory Government Place Names Register Retrieved 9 June 2020.  Significance to Alice Springs  Todd River flooding in 1988 The Todd River is integral to the city of Alice Springs, which has its central business district built on the edge of the river. A large portion of the Alice Springs municipal area is situated on a flood plain of the Todd River, created by flooding upstream of the east-west barrier created by the Heavitree Range, a local segment of the MacDonnell Ranges.Todd River during a rare flood event, Wills Terrace Causeway, Alice Springs, 31 March 1988 The Todd runs south through this range at Heavitree Gap along with the main road and rail links connecting Alice Springs to Adelaide. Heavy flows of the Todd can cut road and rail access, and the bottle neck effect of the Gap can cause flooding in many parts of the town. There have been numerous cases of people drowning as often people camp in the riverbed and the flooding can occur very rapidly and unexpectedly from heavy rains upstream. Heavy rainfalls in the catchment to the north of Alice Springs cause the river to start flowing through the town around 6 to 8 hours later. The river can change from its normal dry bed to a bank-to-bank flow within a matter of 15 minutes, and it is possible to follow the leading edge of the flow as it snakes through town at a walking pace. The riverbed contains sites and trees sacred to the local Arrente people including strong associations with Yeperenye (Caterpillar) Dreaming and with certain old red-river gums in the river representing Kwekatja; pre-initiated boys following the river north.  Recreation and social events  The Henley-on-Todd Regatta has been held in Alice Springs annually since 1961. The ironic regatta is held on the dry riverbed, and draws up to 20,000 spectators. Bottomless boats are picked up by the competitors standing within them and running down the course. The regatta carries insurance against the risk of water in the riverbed. The Henley-on- Todd Regatta has been cancelled once, in 1993, due to flooding - the river had too much water for the race. Other events are held in the dry riverbed, including the closing ceremony for the 2006 Alice Festival. Camping in the riverbed is illegal, although this law is rarely enforced. A flow of water in the river is quite an event for the people of Alice Springs, who flock to the causeways and the Telegraph Station to play in the fleeting waters. Although the riverbed is wide and of gentle gradient through the town the opaque waters combined with trees, waterborne and man-made hazards make playing in the flowing river dangerous. Upstream from Alice Springs the Todd River descends quite rapidly, dropping 100 metres from Junction Waterhole to the Telegraph Station over 8 km of river length (5 km direct). This is a hilly area, and the river bed is strewn with rocks creating some lively rapids during the short- lived flood events. Many locals are wary of these waters, remembering the death of a local man in 1997 who drowned whilst riding the river on a lilo. Local paddlers have recently taken to kayaking this section of grade 2 to 3 rapids.

Political structure in 750-490 BCE Archaic Greece was the period in Greek history lasting from the eighth century BC to the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC, following the Greek Dark Ages and succeeded by the Classical period. In the archaic period, Greeks settled across the Mediterranean and the Black Seas, as far as Marseille in the west and Trapezus (Trebizond) in the east; and by the end of the archaic period, they were part of a trade network that spanned the entire Mediterranean. The archaic period began with a massive increase in the Greek population and a series of significant changes that rendered the Greek world at the end of the 8th century entirely unrecognisable from its beginning. According to Anthony Snodgrass, the archaic period was bounded by two revolutions in the Greek world. It began with a \\"structural revolution\\" that \\"drew the political map of the Greek world\\" and established the poleis, the distinctively Greek city- states, and it ended with the intellectual revolution of the Classical period. The archaic period saw developments in Greek politics, economics, international relations, warfare and culture. It laid the groundwork for the Classical period, both politically and culturally. It was in the archaic period that the Greek alphabet developed, the earliest surviving Greek literature was composed, monumental sculpture and red-figure pottery began in Greece and the hoplite became the core of Greek armies. In Athens, the earliest institutions of democracy were implemented under Solon, and the reforms of Cleisthenes at the end of the archaic period brought in Athenian democracy as it was during the Classical period. In Sparta, many of the institutions credited to the reforms of Lycurgus were introduced during the archaic period, the region of Messenia was brought under Spartan control, helotage was introduced and the Peloponnesian League was founded and made Sparta a dominant power in Greece. Historiography gymnasium and palaestra at Olympia, the site of the ancient Olympic games. The archaic period conventionally dates from the first Olympiad. The word \\"archaic\\" derives from the Greek word archaios, which means \\"old\\" and refers to the period in ancient Greek history before the classical period. The archaic period is generally considered to have lasted from the beginning of the 8th century BC until the beginning of the 5th century BC, with the foundation of the Olympic Games in 776 BC and the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC forming notional starting and ending dates. The archaic period was long considered to have been less important and historically interesting than the classical period and was studied primarily as a precursor to it. More recently, however, archaic Greece has come to be studied for its own achievements. With this reassessment of the significance of the archaic period, some scholars have objected to the term \\"archaic\\" because of its connotations in English of being primitive and outdated. No term which has been suggested to replace it has gained widespread currency, however, and the term is still in use. Much evidence about the Classical period of ancient Greece comes from written histories, such as Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War. By contrast, no such evidence survives from the archaic period. Surviving contemporary written accounts of life in the period are in the form of poetry. Other written sources from the archaic period include epigraphical evidence, including parts of law codes, inscriptions on votive offerings and epigrams inscribed on tombs. However, none of that evidence is in the quantity for which it survives from the classical period. What is lacking in written evidence, however, is made up for in the rich archaeological evidence from the archaic Greek world. Indeed, although much knowledge of Classical Greek art comes from later Roman copies, all surviving archaic Greek art is original. Other sources for the archaic period are the traditions recorded by later Greek writers such as Herodotus. However, those traditions are not part of any form of history that would be recognised today. Those transmitted by Herodotus were recorded whether or not he believed them to be accurate. Indeed, Herodotus did not even record any dates before 480 BC. Political developments Politically, the archaic period saw the development of the polis (or city-state) as the predominant unit of political organisation. Many cities throughout Greece came under the rule of autocratic leaders, called \\"tyrants\\". The period also saw the development of law and systems of communal decision-making, with the earliest evidence for law codes and constitutional structures dating to the period. By the end of the archaic period, both the Athenian and Spartan constitutions seem to have developed into their classical forms. =Development of the polis= The archaic period saw significant urbanisation, and the development of the concept of the polis as it was used in Classical Greece. By Solon's time, if not before, the word \\"polis\\" had acquired its classical meaning, and though the emergence of the polis as a political community was still in progress at this point, the polis as an urban centre was a product of the eighth century. However, the polis did not become the dominant form of socio-political organisation throughout Greece in the archaic period, and in the north and west of the country it did not become dominant until some way into the Classical period. The urbanisation process in archaic Greece known as \\"synoecism\\" - the amalgamation of several small settlements into a single urban centre - took place in much of Greece in the eighth century BC. Both Athens and Argos, for instance, began to coalesce into single settlements around the end of that century. In some settlements, this physical unification was marked by the construction of defensive city walls, as was the case in Smyrna by the middle of the eighth century BC, and Corinth by the middle of the seventh century BC. It seems that the evolution of the polis as a socio-political structure, rather than a simply geographical one, can be attributed to this urbanisation, as well as a significant population increase in the eighth century. These two factors created a need for a new form of political organisation, as the political systems in place at the beginning of the archaic period quickly became unworkable. Athens reformed the Athenian constitution at the beginning of the sixth century BC Though in the early part of the Classical period the city of Athens was both culturally and politically dominant, it was not until the late sixth century BC that it became a leading power in Greece. The attempted coup by Cylon of Athens may be the earliest event in Athenian history which is clearly attested by ancient sources, dating to around 636 BCE. At this time, it seems that Athens' monarchy had already been ended and the archonship had replaced it as the most important executive office in the state, though the archonship could only be held by members of the Eupatridae, the families which made up Athens' aristocracy. The earliest laws of Athens were established by Draco, in 621/0; his law on homicide was the only one to have survived to the Classical period. Draco's law code aimed to replace private revenge as the first and only response of an individual to an offence committed against them. The law code of Draco, however, failed to prevent the tensions between the rich and poor which were the impetus to Solon's reforms. In 594/3 BC, Solon was appointed \\"archon and mediator\\". Exactly what his reforms consisted of is uncertain. He claimed to have taken up the horoi to set the land free, but the exact meaning of horoi is unknown; their removal seems, however, to have been part of the problem of hektemoroi - another word whose meaning is obscure. Solon was also credited with abolishing slavery for debtors, and establishing limits on who could be granted Athenian citizenship. Solon instituted radical constitutional reform, replacing noble birth as a qualification for office with income. The poorest - called thetes - could hold no offices, although they could attend the Assembly and the law courts, while the richest class - the pentacosiomedimni - were the only people eligible to become treasurer, and possibly archon. He set up the Council of the Four Hundred, responsible for discussing motions which were to come before the Assembly. Finally, Solon substantially reduced the powers of the archon by giving citizens the right of appeal; their case was judged by the Assembly. A second wave of constitutional reform in Athens was instituted by Cleisthenes towards the end of the sixth century. Cleisthenes apparently redivided the Athenian population, which had previously been grouped into four tribes, into ten new tribes. A new Council of 500 was instituted, with members from each deme represented. Demes were also given the power to determine their own members (which, in turn, provided them with influence over the membership of the citizen body more generally) and to somewhat determine their own judicial arrangements. These reforms gave the citizen body a sense of responsibility for what happened in the community for the first time. Between the reforms of Solon and Cleisthenes, the Athenian constitution had become identifiably democratic. Sparta Sparta's constitution took on the form it would have in the Classical period during the eighth century BC. By the classical period, Spartan tradition attributed this constitution to Lycurgus of Sparta, which was dated by Thucydides to a little over four centuries before the end of the Peloponnesian War, or around the end of the ninth century. The First Messenian War, probably taking place from approximately 740 to 720 BC, saw the strengthening of the powers of the Gerousia against the assembly, and the enslavement of the Messenian population as Helots. Around the same time, the ephors gained the power to restrict the actions of the kings of Sparta. Thus by the late seventh century, Sparta's constitution had recognisably taken on its classical form. From around 560 BC, Sparta began to build a series of alliances with other Greek states, which became the Peloponnesian League: by 550, cities such as Elis, Corinth, and Megara would be part of the alliance. This series of alliances had the dual purpose of preventing the cities of the League from supporting the Helot population of Messenia, and of helping Sparta in its conflict with Argos, which in the archaic period was along with Sparta one of the major powers in the Peloponnese. =Colonization= Areas settled by Greeks by the close of the archaic period Ruins of the Temple of Heracles, Agrigento, Sicily, within the Valle dei Templi, built in the late 6th century BC during the late archaic period In the eighth and seventh centuries BC, Greeks began to spread across the Mediterranean, the Sea of Marmara, and the Black Sea. This was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements. These Greek colonies were not, as Roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right. Greeks settled outside of Greece in two distinct ways. The first was in permanent settlements founded by Greeks, which formed as independent poleis. The second form was in what historians refer to as emporia; trading posts which were occupied by both Greeks and non-Greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods. Examples of this latter type of settlement are found at Al Mina in the east and Pithekoussai in the west. The earliest Greek colonies were on Sicily. Many of these were founded by people from Chalcis, but other Greek states, such as Corinth and Megara were also responsible for early colonies in the area. By the end of the eighth century BC, Greek settlements in southern Italy were also well established. In the seventh century, Greek colonists expanded the areas that they settled. In the west, colonies were founded as far afield as Marseilles. In the east, the north Aegean, the Sea of Marmara, and the Black Sea all saw colonies founded. The dominant coloniser in these parts was Miletus. At the same time, early colonies such as Syracuse and Megara Hyblaia began to themselves establish colonies. In the west, Sicily and southern Italy were some of the largest recipients of Greek colonisers. Indeed, so many Greek settlements were founded in southern Italy that it was known in antiquity as Magna Graecia - \\"Great Greece\\". It has been observed that in the last quarter of the eighth century, new Greek settlements were founded in Sicily and southern Italy at an average rate of one every other year, and Greek colonists continued to found cities in Italy until the mid-fifth century BC. =Tyranny= Archaic Greece from the mid-seventh century BC has sometimes been called an \\"Age of Tyrants\\". The word œÑœçœÅŒ±ŒΩŒΩŒøœÇ (tyrannos, whence the English \\"tyrant\\") first appeared in Greek literature in a poem of Archilochus, to describe the Lydian ruler Gyges. The earliest Greek tyrant was Cypselus, who seized power in Corinth in a coup in 655 BC. He was followed by a series of others in the mid-seventh century BC, such as Orthagoras in Sicyon and Theagenes in Megara. Various explanations have been provided for the rise of tyranny in the seventh century BC. The most popular of these explanations dates back to Aristotle, who argued that tyrants were set up by the people in response to the nobility becoming less tolerable. As there is no evidence from the time that the nobility were becoming increasingly arrogant during the period, modern explanations of seventh century tyranny have tried to find other reasons for unrest among the people. Against this position, Drews argues that tyrannies were set up by individuals who controlled private armies, and that early tyrants did not need the support of the people at all, whilst Hammond suggests that tyrannies were established as a consequence of in- fighting between rival oligarchs, rather than between the oligarchs and the people. However, recently historians have begun to question the existence of a seventh century \\"age of tyrants\\". In the archaic period, the Greek word tyrannos, according to Victor Parker, did not have the negative connotations it had gained by the time Aristotle wrote his Constitution of the Athenians. When Archilochus used the word tyrant, it was synonymous with anax (an archaic Greek word meaning \\"king\\"). Parker dates the first use of the word tyrannos in a negative context to the first half of the sixth century, at least fifty years after Cypselus took power in Corinth. It was not until the time of Thucydides that tyrannos and basileus (\\"king\\") were consistently distinguished. Similarly, Greg Anderson has argued that archaic Greek tyrants were not considered illegitimate rulers, and cannot be distinguished from any other rulers of the same period. Demography The Greek population doubled during the eighth century, resulting in more and larger settlements than previously. The largest settlements, such as Athens and Knossos, might have had populations of 1,500 in 1000 BC; by 700 they might have held as many as 5,000 people. This was part of a wider phenomenon of population growth across the Mediterranean region at this time, which may have been caused by a climatic shift that took place between 850 and 750, which made the region cooler and wetter. This led to the expansion of population into uncultivated areas of Greece and was probably also a driver for colonisation abroad. Ancient sources give us little information on mortality rates in archaic Greece, but it is likely that not many more than half of the population survived to the age of 18: perinatal and infant mortality are likely to have been very high. The population of archaic Greece would have consequently been very young - somewhere between 40% and two thirds of the population might have been under 18. By contrast, probably less than one in four people were over 40, and only one in 20 over the age of 60. Evidence from human remains shows that average age at death increased over the archaic period, but there is no clear trend for other measures of health. The size of houses gives some evidence for prosperity within society; in the eighth and seventh centuries, the average house size remained constant around 45‚Äì50 m, but the number of very large and very small houses increased, indicating increasing economic inequality. From the end of the seventh century, this trend reversed, with houses clustering closely around a growing average, and by the end of the archaic period the average house size had risen to about 125 m. Economy =Agriculture= Not all arable land in Greece was yet under cultivation in the archaic period. Farms appear to have been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements. They were highly diversified, growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was not too much of a disaster. Crop rotation was practiced, with fields left fallow every other year. Though wheat was preferred, in some parts of Greece barley was the staple grain; where wheat was grown it was durum rather than bread wheat. Alongside these, farmers cultivated pulses, vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables. Olives and grapes, which could be turned into oil and wine respectively, served as cash crops; farmers who cultivated land near population centres could also sell soft fruits and leafy vegetables at market. Livestock were of secondary importance. Sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth. A team of oxen could increase agricultural output significantly, but were expensive to maintain. As they had in the Dark Ages, the wealthiest members of Greek society could own large herds of cattle. This pattern had probably developed before the beginning of the period and remained relatively consistent throughout it. The idea that it was preceded by a period of pastoralism and that agriculture only became dominant in the course of the archaic period is not supported by the archaeological or literary evidence.; No technological innovations in agriculture appear to have occurred, except possibly the increased use of iron tools and more intensive use of manure. The main source for the practice of agriculture in the period is Hesiod's Works and Days, which gives the impression of very small subsistence holdings in which the owner performed most of the labour personally; close reading reveals that much of the produce is to be sold for profit, much of the work to be performed by slaves (douloi or dmoes), and much of the owner's time to be spent away from the farm. Slaves' labour was supplemented by labourers who worked for a wage, as sharecroppers (called hektemoroi at Athens), or to pay off debts; this practice seems to have increased in the eighth century as the growth of the population increased the number of workers available, and intensified in the seventh century with the development of legally enforced debts and the status of the labourers increasingly becoming a source of social strife. =Trade= The Vix Krater, an imported Greek wine-mixing bronze vessel found in the Hallstatt/La T√®ne grave of the \\"Lady of Vix\\", Burgundy, France, c. 500 BC By the late eighth century BC, the archaic Greek world had become involved in an active trade network around the Aegean. It was this trade network which was the source of the orientalizing influence on Greek art in the early part of the archaic period. Meanwhile, to the west, trade between Corinth and Magna Graecia in Southern Italy and Sicily was booming. The eastern trade mainly involved the Greek islands, with Aegina, for instance, acting as an intermediary between the east and the Greek mainland. East Greek states would go on to become extremely prosperous through the sixth century due to the trade with Asia and Egypt. Of the mainland cities, those on the coast were the biggest recipients of trade from the east, especially Corinth. In the early part of the archaic period, Athens does not seem to have been particularly actively involved in this eastern trade, and very few examples of eastern imports have been found in Athens from the eighth or early seventh centuries. By contrast, nearby Euboea had trade-links with the east as early as the first half of the eighth century, and the earliest pottery from the Greek islands found at Al Mina in modern Syria is from Euboea. By the sixth century, Greece was part of a trade network spanning the entire Mediterranean. Sixth century Laconian pottery has been found as far afield as Marseilles and Carthage to the west, Crete to the south and Sardis to the East. =Coinage= At the beginning of the archaic period, coinage had not yet been invented. The Greeks measured the value of objects or fines using certain valuable objects, such as oxen, tripods, and metal spits, as units of account. As in the Near East, precious metal bullion was used as a medium of exchange, principally gold at first, but mainly silver by the beginning of the sixth century. The weight of this bullion (often known as hacksilber) was measured using standard units, named for their value in terms of metal spits (obeloi) and handfuls (drachmai) of metal spits; these terms would later be used as names for Greek coin denominations. Coinage was invented in Lydia around 650 BC. It was quickly adopted by Greek communities in western Asia Minor, although the older system of bullion remained in use as well. The island of Aegina began to issue its distinctive \\"turtle\\" coins before 550 BC, and from there coinage spread to Athens, Corinth and the Cycladic Islands in the 540s BC,; ; Southern Italy and Sicily before 525 BC,; and Thrace before 514 BC. Most of these coinages were very small and were mostly only used within the community that issued them, but the \\"turtles\\" of Aegina (from 530 or 520 BC) and the \\"owls\\" of Athens (from 515 BC) were issued in great quantity and exported throughout the Greek world.; The images on coins initially changed rapidly, but increasingly each community settled on a single image or set of images. Some of these were the symbol or image of an important deity in the city or visual puns on the city's name,For instance, the city of Phocaea issued coins depicting a seal (phoke, in Greek) but in many cases their meaning is obscure and may not have been chosen for any special reason. The reasons for the rapid and widespread adoption of coinage by the Greeks are not entirely clear and several possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, have been suggested. One possibility is the increased ease of commerce which coinage allowed. Coins were of standardised weights, which meant that their value could be determined without weighing them. Furthermore, it was not necessary for users of coinage to spend time determining whether the silver was pure silver; the fact that the coin had been issued by the community was a promise that it was worth a set value. Another possibility is that coinage was adopted specifically to enable communities to make payments to their citizens, mercenaries and artisans in a transparent, fair and efficient way. Similarly, when wealthy members of the community were required to contribute wealth to the community for festivals and the equipment of navies, coinage made the process more efficient and transparent. A third possibility, that coinage was adopted as an expression of a community's independence and identity, seems to be anachronistic.; in more detail: Culture =Art= In the visual arts, the archaic period is characterised by a shift towards representational and naturalistic styles. It was the period in which monumental sculpture was introduced to Greece, and in which Greek pottery styles went through great changes, from the repeating patterns of the late geometric period to the earliest red-figure vases. The early part of the archaic period saw distinctive orientalizing influences, both in pottery and in sculpture. Sculpture Life-size human sculpture in hard stone began in Greece in the archaic period. This was inspired in part by ancient Egyptian stone sculpture: the proportions of the New York Kouros exactly correspond to Egyptian rules about the proportion of human figures. In Greece, these sculptures best survive as religious dedications and grave markers, but the same techniques would have also been used to make cult images. The best-known types of archaic sculpture are the kouros and kore, near life-size frontal statues of a young man or woman, which were developed around the middle of the seventh century BC in the Cyclades. Probably the earliest kore produced was the Dedication of Nikandre, which was dedicated to Artemis at her temple on Delos between 660 and 650 BC, while kouroi began to be created shortly after this. Kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities. Some kouroi, such as the Colossus of the Naxians from around 600 BC, are known to represent Apollo, while the Phrasikleia Kore was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked. Early in the seventh century around 650 BC when kore are widely introduced, Daedalic style made an appearance in Greek sculpture. This style consisted most noticeably of a geometric pattern of female subjects' hair framing their face. On male sculptures they were often posed with one foot in front, as if in motion. Over the course of the sixth century, kouroi from Attica become more lifelike and naturalistic. However, this trend does not appear elsewhere in the Greek world. The genre began to become less common over the last part of the sixth century as the elites who commissioned kouroi declined in influence, and by around 480 kouroi were no longer made. Pottery The period saw a shift in the decoration of Greek pottery from abstract to figurative styles. During the Greek Dark Ages, following the fall of the Mycenaean civilisation, Greek pottery decoration had been based around increasingly elaborate geometrical patterns. Human figures first appeared on Greek pots in Crete in the early part of the ninth century BC, but did not become common on mainland Greek pottery until the middle of the eighth century BC. The eighth century saw the development of the orientalizing style, which signalled a shift away from the earlier geometric style and the accumulation of influences derived from Phoenicia and Syria. This orientalizing influence seems to have come from goods imported to Greece from the Near East. At the beginning of the seventh century BC, vase painters in Corinth began to develop the black-figure style. At the same time, potters began to use incisions in the clay of vases in order to draw outlines and interior detailing. This adoption of incision, probably taken from eastern metalwork, allowed potters to show fine details of their decorations. As the archaic period drew to a close, red-figure pottery was invented in Athens, with the first examples being produced about 525 BC, probably by the Andokides painter. The invention of the red-figure technique in Athens came at around the same time as the development of other techniques such as the white ground technique and Six's technique. =Literature= Attic black-figure vessel with double alphabet inscription, showing new letters Œ•Œß[Œ¶]Œ®, and Œ•ŒßŒ¶Œ®Œ©. Probably early 6th c. BC The earliest extant Greek literature comes from the archaic period. Poetry was the predominant form of literature in the period. Alongside the dominant lyric and epic traditions, tragedy began to develop in the archaic period, borrowing elements from the pre-existing genres of archaic Greek poetry. By the sixth century BC the first written prose in Greek literature appeared. Writing After the end of the Mycenaean period, the art of writing was lost in Greece: by the ninth century probably no Greeks understood the Bronze Age Linear B writing system. From the ninth century BC, however, objects inscribed with Phoenician writing began to be brought into the Greek world, and it was from this Phoenician script that the Greek alphabet developed in the eighth century BC. By the middle of the eighth century BC, pottery inscribed in Greek begins to occur in the archaeological record. The earliest known inscriptions in Greek tend to identify or explain the object on which they are inscribed. Possibly the earliest known Greek inscription is found on a jug from the first half of the eighth century BC, discovered in Osteria dell'Osa in Latium. Most early inscriptions were written in verse, though some from Ionia were in prose, influenced by the prose traditions of Ionia's eastern neighbours. From the beginning of the seventh century, curses and dedications began to be inscribed on objects, and by the sixth century, surviving inscriptions include public records such as law codes, lists of officials, and records of treaties. Poetry Greek literature in the archaic period was predominantly poetry, though the earliest prose dates to the sixth century BC. archaic poetry was primarily intended to be performed rather than read, and can be broadly divided into three categories: lyric, rhapsodic, and citharodic. The performance of the poetry could either be private (most commonly in the symposium) or public. Though there would certainly have been a pre-existing literary tradition in Greece, the earliest surviving works are by Homer. Homer's poetry, though it dates to around the time that the Greeks developed writing, would have been composed orally ‚Äì the earliest surviving poetry to have certainly been composed in writing is that of Archilochus, from the mid-seventh century BC. In contrast with the Classical period, in which the literary culture of Athens dominated the Greek world, the archaic poetic tradition was geographically spread out. Sappho and Alcaeus, for instance, were from Lesbos, while Pindar came from Thebes, and Alcman from Sparta. The beginnings of Greek tragedy also have their roots in the archaic period, though the exact history is obscure. The competition in tragedy at the Great Dionysia began in the 530s BC. Aristotle believed that early tragedy developed from the dithyramb, a choral hymn to Dionysius; by ancient tradition the development from dithyramb to tragedy was ascribed to Thespis. =Religion= Temples were an innovation in the archaic period. These columns are the remains of the Temple of Apollo at Corinth, the first Greek temple to be built in stone. Evidence from Linear B tablets shows that the gods worshipped in archaic and classical Greece shared names with those worshipped by their Mycenaean predecessors. However, the practice of religion changed significantly in the archaic period. The most significant change of the eighth century was the development of permanent temples as a regular feature of sanctuary sites, where in the Dark Ages there had probably been no building specifically used for cult purposes. In the seventh century, this development of temples continued with the appearance of the first monumental stone temple buildings, beginning with the temple of Apollo at Corinth. These temples were probably built to house cult statues of the god. Except on Crete, where there may have been a continuous tradition of cult statues from the Mycenaean period, these cult images were a new development in Greek religion - there is no evidence that Greek Dark Age cult on the mainland used cult images. Along with the introduction of temples came an increase in the number of dedications at cult sites. In the seventh century, the number of surviving dedications decreases again, but there is also a marked change in the character of dedications, from the figurines of animals common in the eighth century to human figurines. In the eighth century, some sanctuaries - for instance at Olympia - begin to attract dedications from outside the local area. Olympia The sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia had been a cult site in the Dark Ages, with dedications there dating back to the tenth century BC, but the eighth century saw an explosion in the number of dedications: 160 animal figurines are known from the 9th century, compared to 1,461 from the 8th. Bronze tripods and jewellery have also been discovered as dedications at archaic Olympia. Though most of the dedications from the 8th century were manufactured in the Peloponnese, dedications also came from Attica, and even as far afield as Italy and the eastern Mediterranean. This enormous explosion in cultic activity in Olympia apparently coincides with the establishment of the Olympic Games as a major event. According to Greek tradition the first games at Olympia had been established by Herakles, but these had fallen out of practice until they were revived in 776 BC. Delphi Delphi, on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, had been continuously occupied from the Bronze Age, but the first evidence of a sanctuary there dates to the eighth century BC, when dedicatory bronze tripods and votive figurines begin to appear in the archaeological record. In the last quarter of the eighth century, the number of offerings at Delphi significantly increased, and there is evidence that these offerings were beginning to come from across Greece. This pan-Hellenic interest in the sanctuary at Delphi was presumably driven by the development of the oracle there. =Philosophy= The archaic period saw the beginning of philosophical and scientific thinking in Greece, and the Greeks' interaction with other cultures from Italy, Egypt, and the Near East in this period had a significant impact on their thought. In the archaic period, the boundaries between disciplines had not yet developed, and so the thinkers who were later identified as philosophers also engaged in practical pursuits: Andrea Nightingale describes them as \\"pragmatic and polymathic\\". For instance, ancient traditions about Thales of Miletus, traditionally identified as the first philosopher, also show his skill in such diverse fields as astronomy, engineering, politics, agriculture, and commerce. Military developments In the archaic period, the most significant military development was the adoption of hoplite warfare by the Greek states. This occurred in the early part of the seventh century BC. The panoply, or hoplite's armour, began to appear in the eighth century, and the earliest known example comes from Argos in the late eighth century. While the pieces which made up the panoply were all in use in Greece by the end of the eighth century, our first evidence for it being worn as a complete set of armour does not come until around 675 BC, where it is depicted on a Corinthian vase painting. The adoption of the phalanx tactics which would be used by hoplites in the Classical period does not appear to have taken place until the mid-seventh century; before this point, the older style of combat in which spears were thrown at the enemy before closing quarters was still used. In the naval sphere, the archaic period saw the development of the trireme in Greece. In the eighth century, Greek navies began to use ships with two banks of oars, and the three banked trireme seems to have become popular in the seventh century. Corinth was probably the first place in the Greek world to adopt the trireme in the mid seventh century BC. It was not until the mid-sixth century, however, that the trireme became the most popular design for Greek battleships, due to its expense. According to Thucydides, the period saw the first Greek naval battles; he dates the first to around 664 BC.

Its source lies near Diamantina in the Espinha√ßo Mountains at an elevation of , after which it flows northward and then east-northeastward across the uplands. At Salto da Divisa, it is interrupted by the Cachoeira (falls) do Salto Grande, high. The river descends to the coastal plain at the city of Jequitinhonha, beyond which it is also called Rio Grande do Belmonte, and empties into the Atlantic Ocean at Belmonte in Bahia state after a course of approximately . The main tributaries are the Ara√ßua√≠ River, Piau√≠, S√£o Miguel, Itacambiru√ßu, Salinas, S√£o Pedro, and S√£o Francisco. The valley of the Jequitinhonha is one of the poorest regions of Brazil and is still prone to endemic yellow fever. It covers , twice the size of Switzerland, and has an approximate population of one million people, distributed in about 80 municipalities. The most populous of these is Almenara (36,254 in 2004) located on the middle Jequitinhonha. The valley is known for its variety of gemstones, colonial-era towns, unique handicrafts and starkly beautiful landscapes immortalized by the Brazilian author Jo√£o Guimar√£es Rosa. Most of the soil is arid and is periodically affected by drought or floods. The economically active population numbers over 400,000, of which 180,000 are in the rural areas practicing rudimentary agriculture and cattle raising. Industry employs 50,000 people and is the most important economic source for the municipalities. In the past the region was covered by forests and occupied by indigenous people. What contributed to the deforestation and subsequent degradation of the region was the predatory activity of mining and extraction of diamonds. Today there are attempts to develop the work of local artisans, especially in ceramics. While living in total isolation, they have developed ceramic craftwork that is mainly performed by the women, who belong to associations. They make utilitarian pieces that are ranked as the most creative works of Brazilian popular art. The famous \\"dolls\\" from that region are in fact pitchers for holding fresh water, thus losing this function and becoming decorative objects.

The story is set in a small Midwestern town, with references later in the story to mysterious \\"pools\\" which seem to cause mutations. Certain families in the area have begun to give birth to abnormal children ‚Äì \\"crawlers\\" ‚Äì with long, soft, pale, elongated bodies. They have poisonous stings (one crawler stung a dog, who promptly turned black and hard, and died soon after) and pulpy exteriors, and seem to emit a kind of glue that allows them to build. The crawlers seem to love building, and a colony of survivors, crawlers who were not killed by disgusted parents, have set up a hive not far from the town. A government official proposes a plan to move the crawlers to an island, where they can be alone, unpersecuted and with the ability to build as much as they like. The story ends the same way it started; from the point of view of a crawler. The crawler mentions how happy the colony is, and that building is progressing quickly.

Work Life Born at Orvieto, Barzini started his career as a journalist in 1898, working for minor Italian magazines and was almost immediately noticed and hired by Luigi Albertini, then director of the Corriere della Sera, the most prestigious Italian newspaper. In 1900, he was sent as war correspondent to Qing Dynasty China, where he witnessed and reported about the Boxer Rebellion, distinguishing himself for his ability to get first hand information. During the Russo- Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, he was embedded within the Imperial Japanese Army, and covered its campaigns in Manchuria. The Itala which won the 1907 Peking to Paris race As a journalist of the Corriere della Sera, in 1907 he accompanied Prince Scipione Borghese in the famous Peking to Paris motor race, winning it after a journey of two months in an Itala car across China and Siberia, traveling amongst regions and people that had never seen a car before. Of this adventure, he left a wonderful memoir, filled with hundreds of photographs, in his book Peking to Paris, that was published in 1908 in eleven different languages: a \\"publishing raid\\", as his proud Italian editor noted in the preface of the book. During World War I, Barzini was the official correspondent with the Italian Army; an account of his experiences was published in The War Illustrated. In 1921, Barzini left the Corriere della Sera and moved to the United States, where he directed the Italian-American newspaper Corriere d'America from 1923 until his return to Italy in 1931. In 1932 he became director of the Il Mattino,Sarti, Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present, p. 142 but in 1933 lost his position when Mussolini mistakenly thought him to be the author of a critical article appeared in the French press. The misunderstanding was soon cleared but Barzini had no further chances to direct a newspaper. After the nomination as senator, he continued to work as a correspondent for the Fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, covering the Spanish Civil War and the Russian Invasion.  Barzini and Fascism  Barzini had pro-Fascist sentiments since before Mussolini's rise to power. He signed his name on the Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals in 1925, and was made a senator in 1934, serving on the Commission of the Armed Forces (April 17, 1939 ‚Äì February 11, 1941), the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Customs legislation (December 31, 1941 ‚Äì February 12, 1943 and June 16 to August 5, 1943), Affairs Committee of Italian Africa (April 15, 1942 ‚Äì June 16, 1943) and the Board of Finance (February 12 to June 16, 1943). He continued to collaborate with Mussolini in the Italian Social Republic, where he directed the official press agency Agenzia Stefani. In 1945, he was convicted for his involvement in the Fascist regime and forbidden to practice the profession of journalist. Death and family Barzini died destitute in Milan in 1947. His son Luigi Barzini, Jr. was also a journalist and writer. His other son Ettore, after joining the Italian resistance movement, was arrested in 1943 and deported to a concentration camp in Germany where he died in 1945, despite his father's efforts to save his life.

Heb. \\"dedication\\", traditionally \\"clinging on\\" to God) is a Jewish concept referring to closeness to God. It may refer to a deep, trance-like meditative state attained during Jewish prayer, Torah study, or when performing the 613 mitzvot (the \\"commandments\\"). It is particularly associated with the Jewish mystical tradition. Etymology ◊ì◊ë◊ß, or deveq, the modern Hebrew word for glue, literally means 'to cling'. It is sometimes referred to as devequt, \\"dvequt\\" or devequs. The concept of Devequt is important in Jewish culture, particularly in Hasidism and in the history of Jewish thought, mysticism, and ethics. In modern Israeli Hebrew, \\"Devequt\\" or \\"dvequt\\" is also often a synonym for dedication toward a particular goal. In religious Judaism and in academia, \\"Dvequt\\" refers most commonly to the philosophical, mystical and Hasidic understanding of \\"Devequt\\" as \\"cleaving\\" or \\"attaching oneself\\" to God in all areas of life. In Kabbalah In Kabbalah, close circles of elite scholars would seek elevated mystical states of devekut, often through ascetic practices. The path in devekut of historical Kabbalah, both in its first Medieval dissemination, and in its 16th century Renaissance, was dependent on many conditions. Kabbalistic thought was limited to more advanced scholars. This was both a historical tradition, and an inherent characteristic. The form of historical Kabbalah embodied in its texts required extensive understanding of mainstream Rabbinic texts, in order to correctly understand its subtle metaphors, and to avoid their anthropomorphism. This danger was subsequently born out in the heretical misinterpretations of Kabbalah by the Sabbateans and their successors. With advanced understanding, dveikut was allied with ascetic practices. In Hasidism With its emphasis on Divine Omnipresence, Hasidic philosophy sought to unify all aspects of spiritual and material life, to reveal their inner Divinity. Dveikut was therefore achieved not through ascetic practices that \\"broke\\" the material, but by sublimating materialism into Divine worship. Nonetheless, privately, many Hasidic Rebbes engaged in ascetic practices, in Hasidic thought for mystical reasons of bringing merit to the generation, rather than formerly as methods of personal elevation. The Baal Shem Tov taught of the superior advantage in Jewish service, of incorporating materialism within spirituality. In Hasidic thought, this was possible because of the essential Divine inspiration within Hasidic expression. In its terminology, it takes a higher Divine source to unify lower expressions of the material and the spiritual. In relation to the Omnipresent Divine essence, the transcendent emanations described in historical Kabbalah are external. This corresponds to the Kabbalistic difference between the Or (Light) and the Maor (Luminary). Essential Divinity permeates all equally, from the common folk to the scholars. =Love of God, Awe of God, and nullification of the ego in Hasidism= Hasidus and Mussar Traditional Jewish philosophical, ethical and mystical thought describes the two fundamental emotions in spiritual devotion, of \\"love of God\\" and \\"fear/awe of God\\". Hasidic thought gives these standard notions its own interpretations. The founder of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov, opposed the ethical practices of admonishment (see Maggid), that could interpret fear of God as fear of punishment. In Hasidism such fear is seen as superficial, egotistical and misrepresentative of the Divine love for Creation. Hasidism sought to replace Jewish observance based on self-awareness with an overriding perception and joy of the omnipresent Divine (see Divine immanence). It likewise reinterpreted the traditional Jewish notion of humility. To the Hasidic Masters, humility did not mean thinking little of oneself, a commendable quality that derives from an external origin in Jewish spirituality, but rather losing all sense of ego entirely (bittul-the negation of ego). This inner psychological spirituality could only be achieved by beginning from the inside, through understanding and awareness of Divinity in Hasidic philosophy. The Hasidic leaders say that \\"to dispel darkness (spiritual impurity and obstacles), one does not fight it\\", the method of Mussar, as such success has the drawback of immersing oneself in the problems. Rather, \\"one turns on the light\\", as \\"a little bit of light gets rid of a lot of darkness\\". The light represents the illumination in the psyche of Hasidic thought. The great Masters of Mussar would counter that such a path has the danger of escapism, as understanding oneself is the basis of mature consciousness. In some Hasidic schools, this pitfall of mystical escapism is avoided. In Habad Hasidism, for example, Jewish meditation differed from \\"General Hasidism\\" in seeking intellectual understanding and inward contemplation over more external forms of emotional enthusiasm. Negation of ego and self sacrifice for another person The Baal Shem Tov taught the value of both laymen and scholars. In a parable, the Tzadik's prayers are like standing on shoulders to reach a high bird. The people give the Rebbe mystical abilities. The Rebbe lives for the followers Across all Hasidism the continual mystical joy and bittul-humility \\"between man and God\\", is ideally reflected likewise in self-sacrifice to help another person \\"between man and man\\". In Jewish law, self-sacrifice is called \\"mesiras nefesh\\", and involves the occasional situations when one forfeits life. In daily terminology in Hasidism, mesiras nefesh means instead devoted sacrifice for God or another person. It is indicative of this that the two Hasidic schools most focused on daily learning of Hasidic thought, Habad (Lubavitch) and Breslav, have also become the two schools involved in the Baal Teshuva movement. In Habad, the talented young men and women devote themselves to going on Shlichus (outreach), rather than the traditional and commendable devotion to Torah study and personal spiritual advancement. In Habad thought, such material and spiritual help for another person achieves its own manifold spiritual illumination and refinement of one's personality. Just as some traditional forms of Jewish thought gave emphasis to fear of punishment as a helpful contribution to beginning Jewish observance, before progressing to more mature levels, so too do some Jewish approaches advocate motivation from eternal reward in the Hereafter, or the more refined ideal of seeking spiritual and scholarly self-advancement through Torah study. Study of Torah is seen by Rabbinic Judaism as the pre-eminent spiritual activity, as it leads to all other mitzvot (Jewish observances). To seek personal spiritual advancement through learning is a commendable ideal of Rabbinic Judaism. Hasidism, ideally, rejected the focus on spiritual reward, or ultimately also the ideal of spiritual self-advancement, as too self-centred. Before the magnificent awareness of Divine majesty, through the mystical path, the automatic response is sincerity and a desire to nullify oneself in the Divine presence. The Habad Shaliach, for example, who moves to a remote place to offer Jewish life there, generally absorbs the notion that it is worthwhile to reject even refined levels of self-centred spiritual advancement, from advanced Yeshiva study, to help another person in their spiritual and physical needs. This attitude has also spread in recent times to non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewish Orthodoxy, as part of the spiritual campaign of the Baal Teshuvah movement. Traditionally, part of the early opposition of the Talmudic focused Mitnagdim, centred in Lithuania, was their fear that Hasidism demoted the traditional importance on Torah study, from its pre-eminent status in Jewish life. Some Hasidic interpretations saw mystical prayer as the highest activity, but their practitioners thought that through this, all their Jewish study and worship would become more spiritualised. By the mid-19th Century, the schism between the two interpretations of Eastern European Judaism had mostly healed, as Hasidism revealed its dedication to Talmudic scholarship, and the Lithuanian World saw advantages in ethical focus. Hasidic anecdotes illustrate its mystical idea of rejecting notions of reward and punishment in favour of bittul (nullification) of the ego and devoted self-sacrifice. In one account: > The first leader of Habad Schneur Zalman of Liadi kept in his desk some of > his unpublished Hasidic mystical writings. A fire broke out that destroyed > them. Afterwards, he asked if anyone had secretly copied them. His close > associates replied that no one had, since he had written atop their pages > the warning of \\"a mystical cutting off of one's soul in the next World for > anyone who copies these manuscripts\\". It seems that Schneur Zalman felt that > he had not been given permission to distribute these teachings from Heaven. > In response to their answer, he replied \\"what has become of Hasidic self- > sacrifice for the sake of Heaven?\\"! Forms of love and fear of God Awe of God are compared to the warmth of gold and luminosity of silver. The rise of a flame reflects the soul's desire to rise The \\"love of God\\" and \\"fear of God\\" receive different interpretations across the historic texts of Judaism, from their different appellations in the Song of Songs, through the Talmud, Medieval Jewish Philosophers, Musar literature and the Kabbalah. To Maimonides, for example, based on the synthesis of Jewish revelation with Greek philosophy, love and fear were to be awakened by contemplating the wonders of Creation, which could reveal the presence of their Creator. Hasidism adopts the Kabbalistic interpretations of the different forms of love, and the mystical interpretations of fear as awe before the Divine majesty. Basing itself on the Kabbalistic explanations of the terminology in the Song of Songs, the classic Hasidic manual for serving God, the Tanya by Schneur Zalman of Liadi, describes many types of mystical love and awe. The methods of Jewish meditation advocated here are particular to the Chabad school of thought, but this text is revered across general Hasidism, as being a systematically structured guide to daily Hasidic life. In all Hasidism, as in Kabbalah, love and awe are awakened by study of mystical texts, in Hasidism of Hasidic philosophy, and in the varying ways of the different schools within Hasidism of applying this in daily Jewish life. Based on Kabbalah, it differentiates between lower and higher forms of love, awe and nullification of the ego. Love of God and spiritual reward The soulful advantage of Hasidism over Kabbalah is expressed in its ability to be expressed without recourse to the esoteric terms of Kabbalah. This is brought out most in the charismatic spiritual stories told about the beloved Masters of Hasidism, as well as in the mystical parables they told to illustrate ideas. One such parable differentiates between superficial forms of love of God and spiritual reward, with true forms of selfless love: > A powerful King was grateful to two simple poor people for their devotion, > and decided to show his gratitude. The poor labourers had never been into > the palace before, but had only seen the King at state occasions. After > receiving their invitations to see the King, in trepidation and excitement, > they approached the palace. As they entered, they were amazed to behold the > magnificence of the palace. One servant was so enamoured of these riches, > that he stopped in the great halls to delight in their beauty. He never > progressed beyond these chambers. Meanwhile, the other servant was wiser, > and his desire was only for the King. The beautiful ornaments did not > distract him, as he entered the inner chamber, where he delighted in > beholding the King himself. Likewise a story is told of how in moments of mystical rapture, Schneur Zalman of Liadi would be seen rolling on the floor, exclaiming \\"God, I don't want your Garden of Eden (Heavenly World), I don't want your World-to-Come (Messianic days), I just want You!\\". =The psychological experience of devekut= The teachers of Hasidism point out that fear of God is different from natural forms of worldly fear, which are uncomfortable experiences, and when experienced, at the time remove other emotions. The awe and trepidation felt when perceiving the mystical greatness of God carries its own delight and bittul-nullification, and can be felt together with longing and delight of mystical love. The natural experience of Nature, and the mystical experience of Nature Hasidic stories recount the travels of Tzadikim Nistarim (hidden Tzadikim) and Hasidic Rebbes among the Shtetls and countryside of Eastern Europe For one who has studied the texts of Hasidism, and has responded to their \\"Wellsprings\\",The Baal Shem Tov's \\"Torah\\", the new teachings of Hasidism, is traditionally called his \\"Wellsprings\\". In the famous mystical account he related in a letter to his brother-in-law Abraham Gershon of Kitov, in which he describes the ascent of his soul to the Heavenly realms on Rosh Hashanah of the year 5507 (1746), he says: \\"I asked the Mashiach, 'When will the Master come?' And he answered, 'By this you shall know: When your teachings will become public and revealed in the world, and your wellsprings burst forth to the farthest extremes..'\\" they can then carry this mystical perspective into daily life. Especially opportune, in traditional Hasidic life, was seeking times of solitude amongst Nature. In Breslov Hasidism, the simple prayers of one's heart in such a setting (Hitbodedut) becomes of central importance. Rabbi Nachman of Breslav poetically depicts the spiritual lifeforce in the grasses of the field as joining and helping in one's prayers. Psychologically too, the aesthetic beauty of Nature becomes elevated by seeing the Divine transcendence reflected in it. To a sensitised soul, a tree can take on the extra dimension of a mystical beauty, that unites the Divine immanence of God with the transcendence. Divine transcendence and immanence are traditional notions in Jewish thought. The Panentheism of the Baal Shem Tov gave new emphasis on the theology and perception of the immanent Divine in all things. This carried earlier Kabbalistic notions, that saw Nature as a manifestation of God, to their theological conclusions. (The Kabbalists explain that one of the Hebrew names of God \\"Elo-h-im\\", representing Divine immanence, is numerically equivalent in Gematria with \\"HaTeva\\" meaning \\"Nature\\"). In the second section of the Tanya, Schneur Zalman of Liadi articulated the philosophical explanations of this. Similarly, the Baal Shem Tov gave a new interpretation of Divine Providence, that described how the movement of a leaf in the wind is significant in the Divine plan. A tale of the Baal Shem Tov also depicts the relationship between consciousness of the Divine immanence in Nature, infused with the higher light of Divine transcendence: > Once, when the Baal Shem Tov was on a journey, Sabbath overtook him on the > highway. He stopped the wagon, and went out into the field to perform the > services that welcome the coming of Sabbath, and to remain there until the > Sabbath was ended. On the field, a flock of sheep were grazing. When the > Baal Shem Tov raised his voice and spoke the prayers that welcome the > Sabbath as the coming of a Bride, the sheep rose upon their hind legs, and > lifted their heads in the air, and stood like people listening.

In the tale, the sheep become aware in their instinctive feelings of the existence of a Divine transcendent reality. According to the tale, the Baal shem Tov's prayers could be holy enough for even instinctive creatures to perceive this. =Deveikut and Jewish observance= Deveikut in cleaving to the Tzadik The early Hasidic movement around the Baal Shem Tov developed from elite esoteric mystical circles of pneumatics,A circle of pneumatics in pre-Hasidism: Article in Studies in East European Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism, Joseph Weiss, Littman Library of Jewish Civilization sometimes connected in practical fellowship. True Deveikut in early Hasidism reflected the superior nature of elevated mystical conduct, beyond the attainment of the regular community, though reaching out to encourage the common folk through popular mystical teaching. With the development of Hasidism as a large scale social movement through the disciples of Dovber of Mezeritch, the doctrine of Mainstream Hasidic \\"Popular Tzadikism\\" developed, especially by Elimelech of Lizhensk. In this, while true deveikut was unattainable by the common folk through their own efforts, the substitution of attachment, sometimes called \\"Deveikut\\", to the Tzadik enabled everyone to perceive and experience Divinity.God and the Tzadik as the two focal points of Hasidic worship, Ada Rapoport-Albert in Essential Papers on Hasidism, edited by Gershon David Hundert, New York University Press This was the first time that Jewish mysticism, embodied in the elite esoteric deveikut of the Tzadik, was combined with practical, popular social doctrine and movement. Tzadikism, and its parallel worship of God through materiality, became the most distinctive feature of Hasidic Judaism, distinguishing Hasidism from other forms of traditional Judaism. The Tzadik embodied Divinity, through Hasidism's adaption of the Kabbalistic notion of Yesod-Foundation, becoming the channel of Divine spiritual and physical blessing to his followers. The Russian Chabad school of Shneur Zalman of Liadi and his successors became the exception from Mainstream Hasidism, in seeking to communicate the elite esoteric dimension of deveikut as widely as possible, through its approach of intellectual investigation of Hasidic thought.Comminicating the Infinite: The emergence of the Habad school, Naftali Loewenthal, University of Chicago Press In this, as in the different Polish Peshischa-Kotzk school that stressed personal autonomy, the main role of the Tzadik was as teacher in Habad, or mentor in Peshischa. The most extreme form of Mainstream Tzadikism, sometimes opposed by other Hasidic leaders, was embodied in \\"Wonder-working\\" Rebbes, for whom Divine channelling of blessing through theurgic practice became central, at the expense of Torah teaching. Hasidism developed the customs of Tish (gathering), Kvitel (request) and Yechidut (private audience) in the conduct of the Tzadik. Deveikut and Teshuvah Teshuvah, often translated into English as \\"Repentance\\", literally means \\"Return\\" to God in Judaism. Halachic codes identify its defining stages in personal spiritual repentance and atonement from sin. Musar literature generally see its role in broader self- understanding, spiritual growth, and personal fidelity. Hasidic thought, based upon Kabbalistic exegesis, gives it a mystical ascending structure. It interprets two levels of return, \\"Lower Teshuvah\\" (Lower Return to God), and \\"Higher Teshuvah\\" (Higher Return). In Hasidic philosophy,The two levels of Teshuvah in Hasidism are defined in the third section of the Tanya. The Hasidic approach to Teshuvah began with the seminal stories, parables and teachings of the Baal Shem Tov Teshuvah does not only involve repentance and rectification of previous spiritual faults. Rather, as the Baal Shem Tov taught, even perfectly righteous Tzadikim need to return to God, in the higher Teshuvah of continual ascent in holiness. With new revelations of mystical Divinity, come new awareness of Bittul (self-nullification) and desire for God in Deveikut. According to Kabbalistic exegesis of the Hebrew word \\"Teshuvah\\" (◊™◊©◊ï◊ë◊î), it can be read as \\"Returning the letter hei\\" (◊™◊©◊ï◊ë-◊î). The Tetragrammaton essential Divine name has two letters \\"hei\\", the second one corresponding to the lower revealed levels of the Four Worlds in Kabbalah, and the first one corresponding to the higher concealed realms. Spiritual lapses by man only reach the lower realms. Lower teshuvah returns the second hei in rectification, higher teshuvah redeems the higher hei in holy ascent. The service of the Hasidic Rebbe Tzadik is continual ascent in dveikut of love, awe and faith of God. This is called the service of \\"Eschapchah\\" (\\"Transformation\\" of darkness to light). The regular folk who rise and fall spiritually, engage more in the service of \\"Iskafiah\\" (\\"Subjugation\\" of impurity). With its characteristic articulation of Divine Omnipresence in everything, Hasidism emphasises the superior quality of both services. Stories are told of Hasidic Rebbes who envied the battle with impurity of the common folk. When a person falls spiritually, and is in need of \\"Lower Teshuvah\\", then Hasidic thought gives encouragement in their new reality. Talmudic theology describes its own two types of Teshuvah, \\"Teshuvah from Fear\\" of God, which erases sin, and \\"Teshuvah from Love\\" of God, which transforms sin into merit. In the path of Hasidic rectification of sin, through mystical dveikut the sin can be transformed (Eschapchah) into full inner merit. Once the Hasidic follower perceives their inner exile from God that sin caused, through mystical study they become awakened to an even stronger desire for God than the Tzadik can reach. This is compared to the thirst of a person in a dry desert without water. With devoted dveikut they can become a fully transformed person, and the route to their superior Divine level was through the sin itself. Accordingly, the Baal Shem Tov interpreted the Hebrew word for sin (◊ó◊ò◊ê-\\"Cheit\\") as possessing a silent letter Aleph at the end. This represents, he said, the concealed spark of holiness within the sin itself, that is revealed in Teshuvah. The Hasidic Rebbe Nachman of Breslov inspires a search for deveikut in distanced Jews. The annual Rosh Hashana kibbutz pilgrimage to his grave in Uman Ukraine, attracts many secular seekers of spirituality Kabbalah describes this process as \\"every spiritual descent is only in order to reach an even higher subsequent ascent\\". In Hasidic Omnipresence, the Baal Shem Tov taught a new view of individual Divine Providence. In this every detail is a concealed part of the Divine plan. Each individual is destined to personally redeem their personal sparks of holiness. In Hasidism, therefore, the spiritual failure is itself the concealed inner beginning of the ultimate ascent. In Hasidic lore, the path of Nachman of Breslov is especially related to giving redemption and encouragement to those people who are caught up in personal difficulties and spiritual impurity. Through his creative articulation of Hasidic mysticism, his teachings can awaken a desire for deveikut, the path of personal hitbodedut expression of one's problems, and a mystical Tikkun HaKlali rectification for all. His main work Lkkutei Moharan is colloquially referred to as the Hasidic book to help those in spiritual difficulties (\\"wickedness\\"). The Tanya of Schneur Zalman of Liadi is subtitled the \\"Hasidic book for the intermediate person\\" who has ease to intellectually meditate on Hasidic philosophy to reach inner Teshuvah. The work Noam Elimelech by Elimelech of Lizhensk instructs the \\"Hasidic book for the righteous\\", and the Mainstream Hasidic path of Teshuvah through cleaving to the Tzadik. Deveikut and Hasidic prayer Mikveh (Ritual immersion pool) in Bircza, Poland. Hasidic custom encouraged male followers to prepare for daily or Sabbath prayer with immersion for mystical elevation The Baal Shem Tov taught the spiritual value of simple Jewish folk. This was at a time after the 17th century Khmelnytsky Uprising had devastated Jewish communities in the Ukraine, and a gap had evolved between the centres of Talmudic scholarship and the unlettered masses. With the traditional preeminence in Rabbinic Judaism on Torah study, it was perceived that the unlettered masses, though not at fault, were spiritually inferior. Maggidim toured Jewish communities offering admonishment of further punishment as a means of encouraging Jewish observance among the disenfranchised masses. In this arena, the Baal Shem Tov's mysticism taught that the sincere common folk could be closer to God than a scholar who has self-pride in his accomplishments. He conveyed his revolutionary ideas in parables, stories and terse teachings among the market places of the populace. The legendary tales about him, later copied in Shivchei HaBesht and other hagiographic compilations describe how much he cherished the sincere prayers of the simple, artless folk. In perhaps the most characteristic Hasidic story, the Baal Shem Tov's conduct instructed his new mystical teaching and boundless delight in the unlettered deveikut of the simple folk: > The saintly prayers of the Baal Shem Tov and his close circle were unable to > lift a harsh Heavenly decree they perceived one Rosh Hashanah (New Year). > After extending the prayers beyond their time, the danger remained. An > unlettered shepherd boy entered and was deeply envious of those who could > read the holy day's prayers. He said to God \\"I don't know how to pray, but I > can make the noises of the animals of the field. \\"With great feeling, he > cried out, \\"Cock-a-doodle-do. God have mercy!\\" Immediately, joy overcame the > Baal Shem Tov, and he hurried to finish the day's prayers. Afterwards, he > explained that the heartfelt prayer of the shepherd boy opened the Gates of > Heaven, and the decree was lifted. Through this emphasis, Hasidism popularised Jewish mysticism. It offered deveikut, that had previously been restricted in transcendent Kabbalistic forms, in new tangible, direct immanent perception. Later Hasidic paths adopted different methods in Jewish meditation for prayer, from the Breslov fostering of emotional Hitbodedut (\\"secluded\\" prayer), to Chabad intellectual Hitbonenut (\\"Contemplative\\" prayer). A part this simple and emphatic inclusion in meditation for God, in the text Likutey Halakhot of Breslov hassidic groups, they teach one of the most hidden form of jewish prayers: one prayer is usually realized after some time, for example to have good business, sons and other important desires of religious man, but this is manifestation before or at the instant of \\"Devekut\\", as follow: \\"Devekut\\" will be direct real revelation of good jewish intention to do Mitzvot and this should be unic true method to have miracle and manifestation of God. Musical expression of Deveikut in Niggunim Hasidism found expression in distinctive Niggunim (ecstatic melodies). Private meditative deveikut niggunim, often in prayer, are usually wordless and bring elevation in worship Joyous niggunim bring the inspiration of deveikut into action and celebration of Hasidic camaraderie A revival of interest in Jewish music was sparked as part of Hasidism. Hasidic niggunim melodies are a distinctive form of voice instrumental music, expressing its mystical emotions of deveikut. Hasidism gave new emphasis to song as a form of worship in prayer. As many niggunim are without words, it is taught that the niggun can reach spiritual levels higher than the words of prayer can reach, as they open the heart to love and awe of God. As many niggunim were composed by Hasidic Masters, it is thought that through singing their melodies, the follower can be attached and inspired by the soul of their Rebbe. This musical dimension of Hasidic deveikut, similar to the new forms of worship in Hasidic storytelling, captures the characteristics of its mystical ecstasy. Different Hasidic groups evolved their own distinctive styles of niggun. Followers customarily gather around on Jewish holidays to sing in groups, receive and give spiritual inspiration, and celebrate brotherly camaraderie. Hasidic custom venerated pilgrimage to the particular Rebbe one had allegiance to, either to gain a private audience or to attend their public gatherings (Tish/Farbrengen). The celebrations give over his Torah teachings, sometimes personal messages, and are interspersed with inspirational niggunim. There are nigunim for private meditation, often in prayer, called devekus nigunim. These are usually slower than communal nigunim, and without lyrics. The Baal Shem Tov spoke of devekus nigunim as \\"songs that transcend syllables and sound\\". Several tunes attributed to him are still used today. Some niggunim originate from non-Jewish sources. Hasidic custom, based on a practice of the Baal Shem Tov, adapted secular anthems, marches and folk songs, ascribing to them a new spiritual interpretation. Hasidic belief is that these songs, in their secular forms, are in spiritual exile. By adapting them to liturgical forms, they are raising \\"Sparks of Holiness\\", based on the Kabbalistic rectification of Isaac Luria. On Jewish festivals, such as in the intermediate days of Sukkot and during the traditional celebration of Simchat Torah, the most joyous day in the Jewish calendar, joyful niggunim are sung in the dancing in the synagogue. Deveikut and Mitzvot There is a historical debate in Rabbinic literature as to whether Torah study or Mitzvot (Jewish observances) are spiritually superior. The 613 Mitzvot themselves are able to be divided into ethical (\\"between man and man\\") and ritual (\\"between man and God\\") observances. Mystical literature, based on Kabbalah, gives its own metaphysical reasons for the mitzvot. Hasidism arose at a time when advanced Talmudic study was seen as the supreme Jewish activity, yet was out of reach of the unlettered masses. The Baal Shem Tov gave new prominence to prayer and sincere observance of the mitzvot by the artless common folk. To the Baal Shem Tov, \\"God desires the heart\\".A Talmudic aphorism that the Baal Shem Tov put at the centre of his teaching Just as the simple prayers of the common masses could reach beyond the self-aware spirituality of scholars, so too, their mitzvot could also reach spiritual levels that the Tzadikim envyed and emulated. In the profound dimension of Hasidic philosophical interpretation of Kabbalah, the mitzvot are described as the metaphorical \\"limbs of the King\\" (God) and an embrace of the Divine essence expressed within the Will of the commandments. Hasidic tales are told of the deveikut of Rebbes and simple Jewish folk in their fulfilment of the mitzvot. Many tales are related of the fervour of Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev, called the \\"Heavenly Advocate of Israel\\" before God. His saintly emotional response to deveikut would break restrained rules of conduct, sometimes humorously in public. In one story, he prepares himself to ritually slaughter a chicken according to the halachic laws of shechita: > As he recited the blessing prior to the act, he dwelt on the holy > commandment he was about to perform. \\"Blessed art Thou, God..\\", he began. > \\"..Who commands us concerning Shechita\\", he concluded in such fervour that > he lost all sense of his surroundings. Opening his eyes after the blessing, > he looked around to find an empty room, with the chicken escaped. \\"Where is > the chicken\\" he began asking!

He was the most honored documentary filmmaker in the Academy history, winning four Oscars from twelve nominations.  Early life  Guggenheim was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, into a prominent German-Jewish family, the son of Ruth (Stix) and Jack Albert Guggenheim. His father and grandfather had a furniture business.Encyclopaedia Judaica (2007) He suffered from dyslexia as a child but the condition went undiagnosed and he was thought to be a \\"slow learner.\\" He did not learn to read until the age of nine.Newsmakers (2003) Gale. Detroit While studying farming at Colorado A&M; in 1943, Guggenheim was drafted into the United States Army assigned to the 106th Division. Due to a severe foot infection, he avoided active duty in the Battle of the Bulge. Upon discharge from the service, he finished his college education at University of Iowa in 1948 and then moved to New York City to pursue a career in broadcasting.  Career  Guggenheim's first job was working for Lew Cohen at CBS, where he was exposed to the new media of film and storytelling. He was subsequently recruited to St. Louis, Missouri, to serve as director of one of the first public television stations in the country, KETC. Two years later in 1954, Guggenheim founded his film production company, Charles Guggenheim and Associates, and produced his first feature film, The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959), starring Steve McQueen. In 1956, he produced the first political advertisement broadcast on television (for Adlai Stevenson). In the early 1960s, Guggenheim formed a partnership with television and documentary film producer Shelby Storck and he and Storck collaborated on several documentaries which were nominated for and/or won Academy Awards. Guggenheim received his first Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject for 1964's Nine from Little Rock, about the desegregation effort in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957. Storck and Guggenheim also collaborated on a well-received political film for Pennsylvania governor Milton Shapp in 1966. That year, Guggenheim moved his company and his family to Washington, D.C., where he became a media advisor to many Democratic political figures. He worked on four presidential campaigns and hundreds of gubernatorial and senatorial campaigns. Guggenheim worked on Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign; after Sen. Kennedy was assassinated, Guggenheim was asked by the Kennedy family to put together a tribute for the 1968 Chicago Convention. It was completed in less than two months. It was shown at the convention and broadcast simultaneously. The convention hall came to a standstill for twenty minutes. The resulting film, Robert Kennedy Remembered (1968), won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. Although Guggenheim occasionally ventured into feature and political film production, he stayed mostly with documentary films. Charles quit producing political campaign advertisements in the early 1980s saying, \\"If you play the piano in a house full of ill repute, it doesn't matter how well you play the piano.\\" He won two more Oscars for short subject documentary film-making, for The Johnstown Flood (1989) and A Time for Justice (1995). He received twelve nominations in total. His last documentary was produced with his daughter and colleague (since 1986) Grace Guggenheim: the 2003 TV documentary film Berga: Soldiers of Another War, a little-known story about a group of 350 American soldiers captured by the Nazis during the Battle of the Bulge who, because they were Jewish or the Nazis thought they \\"looked Jewish\\", were sent to slave labor camp and worked beside civilian political prisoners. (Guggenheim, who was Jewish, had himself been a member of the 106th Division, which had the highest casualty rate of the Allied Divisions. But a severe leg infection caused him to be left behind when his unit was shipped overseas.) Guggenheim finished the film six weeks before his death in October 2002 from pancreatic cancer. Soldiers and Slaves, a companion book to the film, was published by Roger Cohen, New York Times and Herald Tribune columnists using research materials. Personal life Guggenheim married Marion Streett in 1957. They had three children: Davis, Grace, and Jonathan. Davis followed in his father's footsteps as a documentary filmmaker and won an Oscar for best documentary in 2007 for An Inconvenient Truth. Honors and Legacy Guggenheim is recognized with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Archives The moving image collection of Charles Guggenheim is held at the Academy Film Archive. The Charles Guggenheim papers at the Academy‚Äôs Margaret Herrick Library complement the film material at the Academy Film Archive.

It was founded by Filipe Bole, a former Cabinet Minister, as a merger of the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (which had dominated the government in the 1990s), the Fijian Association Party, the Christian Democratic Alliance, and the New Labour Unity Party. All but the last of these had been eliminated from Parliament in the parliamentary election of 2001. The party aimed to secure a niche in the middle ground of Fijian politics, offering a multiracial alternative to the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua/Conservative Alliance coalition of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase (supported almost exclusively by indigenous Fijians) on the one hand, and the Fiji Labour Party of former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry (supported mostly by Indo-Fijians) on the other. Among its policies was a proposal to abolish race-based voting and to introduce universal suffrage for all electorates (at present, 46 of the 71 seats in the House of Representatives represent ethnic communities and are elected from closed electoral rolls). In April 2005, the FDP announced its own dissolution and merger with the newly formed National Alliance Party of Fiji, founded by Ratu Epeli Ganilau, a chief whose father and father-in-law both served as President of Fiji.

Scott. Based on the 1967 novel Un animal dou√© de raison (lit. A Sentient Animal), by French writer Robert Merle, the screenplay was written by Buck Henry. Plot A brilliant and driven scientist, Jake Terrell, and his young and beautiful wife, Maggie, train dolphins to communicate with humans. This is done by teaching the dolphins to speak English in dolphin-like voices. Two of his dolphins, Alpha (\\"Fa\\") and Beta (\\"Bea\\"), are stolen by officials of the shadowy Franklin Foundation headed by Harold DeMilo (Fritz Weaver), the supportive backer of the Terrells' research. After the dolphins are kidnapped, an investigation by an undercover government agent for hire, Curtis Mahoney (Paul Sorvino), reveals that the Institute is planning to further train the dolphins to carry out a political assassination by having them place a magnetic limpet mine on the hull of the yacht of the President of the United States.

The film version was originally going to be directed by Roman Polanski for United Artists in 1969, with Polanski writing the script. However, while Polanski was in London, England, looking for filming locations in August 1969, his pregnant wife, the actress Sharon Tate, was murdered in their Beverly Hills home by disciples of Charles Manson. Polanski returned to the United States and abandoned the project. The following year it was announced Franklin Schaffner would make the movie for the Mirisch Corporation. These plans were frustrated and Joseph Levine ended up buying the project from United Artists for Mike Nichols. Scott was paid $750,000 for his role. The film was mostly shot on Abaco Island in The Bahamas. Production was extremely difficult. Scott allegedly held up production for three days at the start of the shoot. Nichols later described it as the toughest shoot he had done to date.  Reception  The film received mixed reviews when released in 1973. Pauline Kael, the film critic for The New Yorker, suggested that if the best subject that Nichols and Henry could think of was talking dolphins, then they should quit making movies altogether. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune penned a positive review commenting that, \\"Ultimately, The Day of the Dolphin works because of the values it celebrates and Scott communicates. The values are communication and love. In spite of their material, Nichols and Scott have given us a film that reminds us what love and care can do not so much for the object of affection, but for the person who tenders it. On that level, The Day of the Dolphin is really a fable.\\" The film was not successful commercially, though it was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Best Original Score (Georges Delerue) and Best Sound (Richard Portman and Larry Jost). Levine also claimed the movie had guaranteed pre-sales of $8,450,000 to cover costs, including a sale to NBC, which had expressed interest into turning the story into a TV series. Alpha the dolphin was named best animal actor in the 24th Patsy Awards. Levine admitted the film was not a success: > The rushes looked great. But it just didn't jell somehow.

As of July 2020, The Day of the Dolphin holds a rating of 42% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/day_of_the_dolphin Differences from the novel and other sources of inspiration Merle's novel, a satire of the Cold War, is supposedly the basis for this film, but the film's plot was substantially different from that of the novel. The movie is instead inspired in part from the scientist John C. Lilly's life. A physician, biophysicist, neuroscientist, and inventor, Lilly specialized in the study of consciousness. In 1959, he founded the Communications Research Institute at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and served as its director until 1968.

Newnes, The section of river named Kagera begins in Burundi, flowing out from Lake Rweru. From the lake, it flows east along the Rwanda-Burundi and Rwanda-Tanzania borders to a confluence with the Ruvubu River. The waters of the Kagera are thus provided by two major tributaries, the Nyabarongo of Rwanda, which feeds Lake Rweru, and the Ruvubu of Burundi. It is unknown which of these two feeder rivers is the longer and hence the ultimate source of the Nile. From the confluence, the Kagera flows north along the Rwanda-Tanzania border, over Rusumo Falls and through Akagera National Park. It then takes a turn to the east, following the Tanzania-Uganda border and emptying into Lake Victoria in Uganda. In 1898, Richard Kandt discovered the source of the Kagera. The river has featured prominently in the histories of the countries it runs through, particularly Rwanda. In 1894, German Gustav Adolf von G√∂tzen crossed the Kagera at Rusumo Falls, beginning the Rwandan colonial era; and in 1916, during World War I, the Belgians defeated the Germans, entering Rwanda by the same route. The river gained international notoriety in 1994 for carrying bodies from the Rwandan genocide into Lake Victoria, causing a state of emergency to be declared in areas of Uganda, where these bodies eventually washed up. Geography The Kagera rises in Burundi and flows into Lake Victoria. It is the largest single inflow into the lake, contributing approximately 6.4 billion cubic metres of water a year (about 28 per cent of the lake's outflow). The Kagera is formed by the confluence of the Ruvuvu and the Nyabarongo, close to the northernmost point of Lake Tanganyika. It forms parts of the Burundi‚ÄìTanzania, Rwanda‚ÄìTanzania, Burundi‚ÄìRwanda, and Tanzania‚ÄìUganda borders. It lends its name to Akagera National Park in northern Rwanda, as well as to the Kagera Region of Tanzania. On the river are the Rusumo Falls, an important crossing point between Rwanda and Tanzania. It is near the town of Rusumo. Fish The Kagera River basin is rich in fish. , there were at least 55 species known from the Rwandan section alone and the actual number is likely higher. Additionally, there are at least 15 undescribed species of haplochromine cichlids that are endemic to some of the lakes in the upper parts of the river basin. Because of the many waterfalls and rapids, the various sections of the Kagera River basin are clearly separated, making movements between them difficult or even impossible to fish. Genocide During the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the Kagera was used to dispose of corpses as thousands of Tutsis and Hutu political moderates were murdered on the river banks. The river brought the massacred bodies into Lake Victoria, creating a serious health hazard in Uganda.

It is a fast- growing city that experienced a population boom in the latter half of the twentieth century. Around 1800 BCE, the area around Mardan was part of the homeland of the Gandhara grave culture. Rock edicts of the ancient Indian King Ashoka in the nearby Shahbaz Garhi, written in the right-to-left Kharosthi script, date from the Mauryan period (mid-200s BCE) and represent the earliest irrefutable evidence of writing in South Asia. The nearby Takht-i-Bahi which has remains of an ancient Buddhist monastery was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. History Mardan is located in a region rich in archaeological sites. In 1962, the Sanghao Caves were discovered outside of Mardan, which yielded artefacts from the Middle Paleolithic period, over 30,000 years ago. Other sites in the immediate area have yielded evidence of human activity from the Upper Paleolithic period. Further excavations from the area around Jamal Garhi near Mardan recovered artefacts from the Mesolithic period. The Edicts of Ashoka were carved on a massive boulder near Mardan around 250 BCE. The Takht-i-Bahi complex near Mardan dates from the first century CE. The area around Mardan then formed part of the homeland of the Gandhara grave culture around 1800 BCE. The Gandharan grave culture appears to have been a Central Asian group that may represent part of the Indo-Aryan invasion into the subcontinent.

A member of the Church of the Nazarene, his \\"magnum opus\\" was the three volume systematic theology Christian Theology. Early Life and education Henry Orton Wiley was born in Marquette, Nebraska on 11 November 1877. The Wiley family moved to California in April 1886, then to Oregon in 1893. H. Orton Wiley graduated from Medford High School in Oregon on May 31, 1895. In his last year of high school, Wiley was employed at a local drugstore and began the study of Pharmacy and was awarded his certificate of Pharmacy by the Oregon State Board of Pharmaceutics on March 9, 1897. He later received a diploma in Pharmacy in 1897 from the National Institute of Pharmacy in Chicago, Illinois. Wiley converted to Christianity in 1895. Wiley met his wife, Alice, while working at his father's store. They were married in 1902. Wiley decided to further his education and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of the Pacific in 1910 and also a Bachelor of Divinity from Pacific Theological Seminary the same year. Career in education In 1910, Wiley was elected dean of the Pacific Bible College under President Phineas F. Bresee. Wiley was asked by President Phineas F. Bresee to write the first catalogue for the college. In it, Wiley defended the role of the Christian liberal arts college, emphasizing its roles as a cultural custodian and promoter of spiritual intensity. Later, Wiley would himself become president of Nazarene University in 1913, but leave in 1916 to become president of the Idaho-Oregon Holiness School, which would be renamed Northwest Nazarene College under Wiley's leadership. He would leave Idaho to become president in California again in 1927 until leaving again in 1928, and was president at Pasadena one more time from 1933 to 1949. Upon arriving at the Idaho-Oregon Holiness School, Wiley was offered a notable ten-year contract as president, during which he published the first Oasis yearbook and Nazarene Messenger, wrote a standard three-volume theological statement of the Church of the Nazarene. He ‚Äúguided the school between Scylla of emotionalism and the Charybdis of formalism.‚Äù His leadership pushed the upstart institution to become a liberal arts school, a dream represented through changing the school‚Äôs name to Northwest Nazarene College. Theology In his book Introduction to christian theology, Wiley argues for the Arminian views of unlimited atonement, conditional election and prevenient grace in opposition to the main points of Calvinism and also the Penal substitution theory. In Christian theology, he stresses that the prevenient grace, operates in a continuous way from \\"the first dawn of the moral life\\". This would allow a synergistic co-operation with the human will, that doesn't undermine the responsibility and the total depravity of man. Wayne Grudem considers this work to be the best Arminian systematic theology from the twentieth century, but not reaching to the level of John Miley‚Äôs. Memorial/legacy Orton died of cancer in his residence in Pasadena the 22nd August 1961. The H. Orton Wiley House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in part for its association with Wiley.

The community population at the 2011 census was 874. History River Ely near Peterston-super-Ely As its name suggests, the local parish church, now in heavily restored simple Perpendicular style, is dedicated to Saint Peter situated close to the River Ely (). In the conservation area, the oldest structure is what remains of Peterston Castle built by the Norman lords of the manor, Le Sor family, probably in the mid-13th century and replacing an earlier structure which had been destroyed by the Welsh and again by Owain Glynd≈µr in 1403. Despite being a scheduled monument, the castle remains have been progressively destroyed by housing development. The earliest feature of St. Peter‚Äôs Church is the 14th-century chancel arch but the church is more notable for its Perpendicular style tower. The west tower with its corbelled battlements and gargoyles is 15th century. The chancel was mostly rebuilt in 1890-91 by Kempson & Fowler. From the medieval period until the 19th century, the settlement was a small rural community with the majority of its inhabitants deriving an income from agriculture. Major change arrived with the construction of the railway (opened 1850) and the opening of a railway station west of the village in the second half of the 19th century. A comparison of the pre-railway Tithe Map of c. 1840 with the First Edition Ordnance Survey of c.1880 shows that the railway required a slight re-alignment of the through road giving rise to the unusual alignment of properties south of the railway bridge. The train station closed in 1971 and demolished. During the immediate post-railway period a school was built south of the church. The Old Rectory was built in 1857 and the chancel of St. Peter‚Äôs Church was largely reconstructed. It has been suggested that the higher roots of the older yews in the churchyard indicate that the churchyard was cleared in the 19th century. In the early 20th century John and Reginald Cory, coal magnates, began a Garden Village to the south of, and quite separate from, the historic village, now known as Wyndham Park. Main Avenue was, and remains, a wide and straight spine road uphill from a bridge over the river. The road originally crossed the river on the site of today‚Äôs footbridge but is now re-directed westwards along Wyndham Park Way. The former mill is now a private residence. The church‚Äôs lynch gate is dedicated to those who fell in the Great War. The cost of the playing fields was deferred by grateful parishioners following the 1939-1945 War. Further housing development took place in the late 20th century adding to the settlement‚Äôs population and thereby helping the village to continue to support a village shop and school. The Peterston Church in Wales Primary School has about 180 pupils. Amenities Entering the village from the east, the village primary school is on the right; the Three Horse Shoes pub is on the left. Past the pub, is the village shop and post office, the local BT telephone exchange, the church and the railway bridge over the South Wales Main Line from to and . The Sportsmans Rest, a freehold pub, is on the right. In 2009, the church was an outdoor and indoor filming location for the third series of Gavin & Stacey. Local residents were used as extras. The memorial park is opposite the church. The playing fields are used by the Peterston Juniors Football Club and the local tennis club. The tennis club contains three modern all-weather courts and youth community coaching is available. A community playground was erected in 1975 and upgraded to modern standards in 2013 by local residents through fundraising. In 2019, the tennis courts at the south-western end of the playing fields were converted to a multi-use-games area, created for the use by local sports clubs and for residents alike. This is managed by the Peterston Sports and Social Club. Peterston-super-Ely is an outdoor filming location for the Welsh language soap opera, Pobol y Cwm. Governance The Peterston-super-Ely Community Council is elected by the community. As of 2017, the council comprises eight Independent councillors with no political affiliation. Four of these have been co-opted onto the council. Peterston-Super-Ely is included in a Peterson- super-Ely electoral ward with a representative on the Vale of Glamorgan Council.

Early life Anne was born in Paris, France, the only daughter of Prince Ren√© of Bourbon-Parma and Princess Margaret of Denmark. With her three brothers she spent her childhood in France. To her family she was known as Nane (in English Nan).Romania Regala Their holidays were spent alternately at the Villa Pianore in Lucca with their paternal grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Parma, or at Bernstorff Palace in Copenhagen with their maternal grandfather. Anne's paternal aunt was the last Austrian Empress Zita while maternal great aunts were Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom. In 1939 her family fled from the Nazis and escaped to Spain. From there they went on to Portugal and then to the United States. She attended the Parsons School of Design in New York City from 1940 to 1943. She also worked as a sales assistant at Macy's department store. In 1943, she volunteered for military service in the French Army. She served in Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Luxembourg and in liberated Germany, as an ambulance driver. Anne received the French Croix de guerre for her wartime service. Marriage =Engagement= In November 1947, Anne met King Michael I of Romania who was visiting London for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten. In fact, a year previously Queen Mother Elena had invited Anne, her mother, and brothers for a visit to Bucharest, but the plan did not come off. Meanwhile, Michael had glimpsed Anne in a newsreel and requested a photograph from the film footage. She did not want to accompany her parents to London for the royal wedding as she wished to avoid meeting King Michael in official surroundings. Instead, she planned to stay behind, go alone to the Paris railway station and, pretending to be a passerby in the crowd, privately observe the king as his entourage escorted him to his London-bound train. However, at the last moment she was persuaded by her first cousin, Prince Jean of Luxembourg, to come to London, where he planned to host a party. Upon arrival in London, she stopped by Claridge's to see her parents, and found herself being introduced unexpectedly to King Michael. Abashed to the point of confusion, she clicked her heels instead of curtseying, and fled in embarrassment. Charmed, the king saw her again the night of the wedding at the Luxembourg embassy soir√©e, confided in her some of his concerns about the Communist takeover of Romania and fears for his mother's safety, and nicknamed her Nan. They saw each other several times thereafter on outings in London, always chaperoned by her mother or brother. A few days later, she accepted an invitation to accompany Michael and his mother when he piloted a Beechcraft aeroplane to take his aunt Princess Irene, Duchess of Aosta, back home to Lausanne. Sixteen days after meeting, Michael proposed to Anne while the couple were out on a drive in Lausanne. She initially declined, but later accepted after taking long walks and drives with him. Although Michael gave her an engagement ring a few days later, he felt obliged to refrain from a public announcement until he informed his government, despite the fact that the press besieged them in anticipation. Michael returned to Romania, where he was told by the prime minister that a wedding announcement was not \\"opportune\\". Yet within days it was used as the government's public explanation for Michael's sudden \\"abdication\\", when in fact the king was deposed by the Communists on 30 December. Anne was unable to get further news of Michael until he left the country. They finally reunited in Davos on 23 January 1948. =Wedding= Michael and Anne on a 2014 Romanian stamp As a Bourbon, Anne was bound by the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church, which required that she receive a dispensation to marry a non-Catholic Christian (Michael was Orthodox). At the time, such a dispensation was normally only given if the non-Roman Catholic partner promised to allow the children of the marriage to be raised as Roman Catholics. Michael refused to make this promise since it would have violated Romania's monarchical constitution, and would be likely to have a detrimental impact upon any possible restoration. The Holy See (which handled the matter directly since Michael was a member of a reigning dynasty) refused to grant the dispensation unless Michael made the required promise. Helen, Queen Mother of Romania and her sister Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, Duchess of Aosta (an Orthodox married to a Catholic Prince) met with the fianc√©e's parents in Paris, where the two families resolved to take their case to the Vatican in person. In early March, the couple's mothers met with Pope Pius XII who, despite the entreaties of the Queen Mother and the fact that Princess Margrethe pounded her fist on the table in anger, refused permission for Anne to marry Michael. It has been surmised that the Pope's refusal was, in part, motivated by the fact that when Princess Giovanna of Italy married Anne's cousin, King Boris III of Bulgaria, in 1930, the couple had undertaken to raise their future children as Roman Catholics, but had baptized them in the Orthodox faith in deference to Bulgaria's state religion. However, Michael declined to make a promise he could not keep politically, while Anne's mother was herself the daughter of a mixed marriage between a Catholic (Marie d'Orl√©ans) and a Protestant (Prince Valdemar of Denmark), who had abided by their pre-ne temere compromise to raise their sons as Protestant and their daughter, Margrethe, as Catholic. Although under a great deal of stress, the engaged couple resolved to proceed. Anne's paternal uncle, Xavier, Duke of Parma, issued a statement objecting to any marriage conducted against the will of the Pope and the bride's family. It was he, not the Pontiff, who forbade Anne's parents to attend the wedding. Michael's spokesman declared on 9 June that the parents had been asked and had given their consent, and that the bride's family would be represented at the nuptials by her maternal uncle, the Protestant Prince Erik of Denmark, who was to give the bride away. The wedding ceremony was held on 10 June 1948 in Athens, Greece, in the throne room of the Royal Palace; the ceremony was performed by Archbishop Damaskinos, and King Paul of Greece served as koumbaros. Guests at the wedding included: Michael's mother Helen, Queen Mother of Romania, aunts Queen Frederica, Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, Duchess of Aosta, Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark; cousins Alexandra, Queen Consort of Yugoslavia, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark, Crown Prince Constantine of Greece and Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, the three youngest ones serving as bridesmaids and pageboy; Anne's maternal uncle Prince Erik of Denmark; Princess Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, Princess Olga of Yugoslavia, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, Prince George William of Hanover and many other dignitaries. Michael's father, Prince Carol, and his sisters, Maria, Queen Mother of Yugoslavia, Princess Elisabeth of Romania (ex-Queen Consort of Greece) and Princess Ileana of Romania were notified, but not invited. As no papal dispensation was given for the marriage, when it was celebrated according to the rites of the Eastern Orthodox Church, it was deemed invalid by the Roman Catholic Church, but perfectly legal by every other authority. The couple eventually took part in a religious ceremony again, on 9 November 1966, at the Roman Catholic Church of St Charles in Monaco, thus satisfying Roman Catholic canon law.  Adult life  After their wedding in 1948, Anne and Michael rented a house in Hertfordshire for four years, where they became market gardeners and farmed poultry. In 1956 they moved to Versoix on Lake Geneva, and raised five daughters there. In 1992 Anne and Michael visited Romania for three days; it was Anne's first visit to the country. From 1993 to 1997, despite repeated attempts, Michael was refused entry to Romania by the hostile Romanian government. During these years Anne visited the country a number of times representing her husband. After 1997, there were no restrictions on Anne and Michael's entry into Romania. Elisabeta Palace was put at their disposal by the government, and they recovered some properties from the state, including SƒÉv√¢r≈üin Castle and Pele≈ü Castle. In June 2008, Anne and Michael celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary with three days of events in Romania, which was the largest celebration the couple ever had since their wedding in June 1948. * Events were:  On the 10th, a concert by the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra was held in their honour at the Romanian Athenaeum.  On the 11th, there was a reception held at Athenee Palace in Bucharest where members of the Romanian Government and Diplomatic corps had the chance to congratulate the couple.  On the 12th, in the morning at the National Museum of Romanian History there was a book release about Anne and King Michael's 60 years together published by Agerpres. In the evening there was a private formal dinner held at Pele»ô Castle in Sinaia. Guests at the events included: their two eldest daughters Crown Princess Margareta and Princess Elena, their sons-in-law Prince Radu and Alexander Nixon and Princess Elena's two children: Prince Nicholas and Elisabeta-Karina; Michael's maternal cousins ex-King Constantine II of Greece, Queen Sofia of Spain, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta and Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark who were the original attendants at their wedding in 1948; Queen Anne-Marie of Greece, King Simeon II of Bulgaria and his wife Queen Margarita, Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia and his wife Crown Princess Katherine, Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, Maximilian, Margrave of Baden and his wife Archduchess Valerie, Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este, Princess Silvia, Duchess of Aosta, Princess Marie Astrid of Luxembourg, Prince Philip of Bourbon-Parma and his wife Princess Anette.

She has been both an enemy to and a member of the Teen Titans, and she is the daughter of Deathstroke. Rose Wilson first appeared in Deathstroke the Terminator #15 and was created by Marv Wolfman and Art Nichols. A loose variation of the character (with different name Isabel Rochev and Ravager alias) appears in the second season of Arrow, portrayed by Summer Glau, while the version of Rose Wilson makes her live adaptation debut in the second season of the DC Universe series Titans, played by Chelsea Zhang. Fictional character biography =Introduction= Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) meets a Cambodian woman named Lillian Wilson (born: Lillian Worth) on a search-and-rescue mission a few years after his divorce from Adeline Kane. His mission is to make sure that she escapes war-torn Cambodia safely. After an intermittent love affair with Wilson, Worth gives birth to a daughter whom she names Rose. Believing it to be in the child's best interest, Worth keeps Rose a secret from Wilson. Worth eventually settles down at a brothel in New York City, and, during a time when Deathstroke is injured and a fugitive from the law, Worth takes him in and nurses his wounds. Wintergreen (Deathstroke's butler) discovers 14-year-old Rose and suspects that she is Deathstroke's daughter. When Ravager (Wade DeFarge ‚Äì Deathstroke's half-brother) kills Deathstroke's friends and family, Ravager discovers Rose, captures her, and tells her that Deathstroke is her father. Wintergreen and Worth launch a rescue attempt, but Worth is presumed dead after she drives a Jeep off a cliff while trying to run over DeFarge. Wintergreen successfully rescues Rose and escapes. Rose tries to reach out to her father, but he turns her away. He fears for her safety because he believes himself to be responsible for the deaths of two of his sons. Deathstroke leaves her in the care of the Teen Titans superhero team. During a training exercise, Rose is injured and taken to the hospital, and her precognitive powers emerge for the first time when she has a lengthy vision of Deathstroke's future. She awakens before she can test her powers further. She leaves the Titans shortly after and does not see them again until the Technis Imperative conflict, where she allies herself with the Titans to save fellow Titan Cyborg. During this incident, she vocally challenges the New God Big Barda, as the Titans and the Justice League had come to blows. Barda seems more amused than concerned over Rose and their potential fight is neutralized by other forces. New Ravager The Madison family in Chicago adopt Rose, but DeFarge kills her new family. The Ravager claims to have been offered $100,000 for her death by an anonymous source, but neither of them know that Deathstroke hired DeFarge in an attempt to bring Rose closer to him. Deathstroke anonymously alerts the Titans that Rose's life is in danger, and they fight to defend her. All of the fighters are rendered unconscious by an explosion of halothane gas, and Rose awakens in Deathstroke's lair. He apologizes to Rose for abandoning her and says that she is the only family he has left. Deathstroke suggests that she become his apprentice, offering DeFarge as her first kill. Rose accepts and takes the name ‚ÄúRavager‚Äù for herself. Deathstroke secretly injects Rose with the same serum that gave him his abilities, and it causes her to suffer from psychosis. Deathstroke doubts Rose's readiness to work with him and plans to disown her after she hesitates and is unable to kill Deathstroke's son Jericho (when he possesses Beast Boy's body). To prove her loyalty, she gouges out an eye to match his missing eye. Batgirl vs Ravager. Cover to Batgirl #64 (2005). Art by Al√© Garza. After Rose suffers a defeat at the hands of Batgirl, Deathstroke places her under the tutelage of Nightwing after Slade is led to believe he has given up being a hero. Nightwing agrees to train Rose, while surreptitiously teaching her the values of heroism. Although Rose develops a crush on Nightwing as the training progresses, the attraction seemed entirely one-sided. In order to test Grayson's loyalty, Deathstroke replaces Rose's missing eye with one carved from Kryptonite and pits her and Nightwing against Superman. Rose attempts to kill Superman, but Nightwing uses Superman's concern for the safety of not only the civilian bystanders, but Rose herself as her final lesson on altruism. Nightwing agrees to stay away from Rose on the condition that Bl√ºdhaven remained off-limits to the latest incarnation of The Society, of which Deathstroke is a charter member. Following the bombing of Bl√ºdhaven on Deathstroke's orders in Infinite Crisis, Nightwing returns and informs Rose that the Kryptonite Deathstroke had implanted in her eye-socket is not just a danger to Kryptonians, but it is also carcinogenic and is indeed lethal to humans under extended periods of prolonged exposure. Enraged and heartbroken that her father would endanger her life so dismissively, and emboldened by Nightwing's tutelage, Rose breaks all ties with her father and runs away. One year after the events depicted in the Infinite Crisis crossover, Rose once again joins the Teen Titans. She wears the same costume and wields two katana- style swords. With Deathstroke and his serum's influence gone, Rose appears more balanced than previously depicted. Robin admits Rose to the team as a favor to the team founder and ex-leader, her former mentor Nightwing. Rose forms a friendship with Kid Devil, using his flame breath to light her cigarettes. When Kid Devil is injured during a mission, Rose defends him, and on multiple occasions threatens those she deemed a threat to him. She later admits to Kid Devil that she is afraid of being kicked out, should the old members return to the team. Over the lost year, the Teen Titans came to the conclusion that they needed more members. After discovering that Raven believes there was a traitor on the team during the previous year, the team agrees to begin with her. The team travels the world in search of Raven apparently on the run from the traitor. They also meet several other former Titans, such as Red Star, Zatara, and Bombshell. During a meeting with Bombshell, Rose is accused of being the latest traitor, working for Deathstroke instead. She denies the accusation, supported by not only Kid Devil, but also Wonder Girl, who believes Rose would never go back to her father. Robin and Cyborg agree that Ravager would return to the Tower. Furious, Rose prepares to quit the team altogether until the team's caretakers Wendy and Marvin reveal to her that the traitor had stolen one particular object: the computer disk containing Jericho's essence. Realizing why Raven is truly on the run, Ravager quickly returns to the Titans' aid, just as the traitor is revealed to be Bombshell. Ravager manages to save Raven, just as the empathic Titan uses the same spell which resurrected her to resurrect Rose's dead and previously insane half-brother Jericho. Upon the resurrection of her elder brother, Joseph and Rose begin fraternizing, unaware that Bombshell's betrayal was orchestrated by Deathstroke, and that their teammates have been subdued by his associates. Later, Rose and Joseph fly to New York to have lunch with Nightwing, after which they go to the original Titans Island and discover that someone has built a demented version of the original tower there. Upon entering, they find that their father has kidnapped their teammates, all in order to gain control of them again. Rose and Joey then rescue Robin from Slade and Batgirl, during which Rose finally has her rematch with Cassandra Cain. Rose and Joey both attempt to stop their father, but they are defeated and left at his mercy until Nightwing, Donna Troy, Raven, Cyborg, Duela Dent, Beast Boy, and Bart Allen arrive. Following the death of her former-teammate Bart Allen, Rose attends his funeral in Countdown #43 along with the rest of the Teen Titans. In Teen Titans #50, Rose is present for Bart's wake, although she slips off after a while, bored with the somber, reminiscent atmosphere, and invites Kid Devil to join her in skinny-dipping in the Titans' swimming pool. In Teen Titans vol. 3 #51, the Titans Tomorrow‚Äîa possible future version of the current Titans team‚Äîarrive in the present to aid the Teen Titans against Starro-controlled villains. Ravager's future-self is absent from the group and it is revealed that she betrays the team (primarily Bart Allen and Kid Devil) at some point. Kid Devil, his adult version Red Devil, and Rose are then sent to battle against Rampage & Livewire. Red Devil tries to convince Eddie to let Rose die during the fight, so that she does not manage to betray them in the future. Initially, it appears that Eddie intends to do so, before betraying his older self in order to aid Rose. Later, the trio return to the Titans Lair (home of the original Teen Titans), where they meet with Blue Beetle. There, Red Devil attacks Blue Beetle, claiming that he too cannot be trusted. Eddie, Rose, and Jaime find themselves surrounded by an army of Titans led by Lex Luthor before they all battle against an invading army of Starros. Thanks in large part to Blue Beetle's powers and Robin and Wonder Girl managing to supposedly alter Robin's future (and thus alter the future of the Titans as a whole), the army of Titans is apparently defeated. In Teen Titans #57, Rose is attacked by Persuader, Copperhead, and Dreadbolt of the Terror Titans, who had managed to infiltrate Titans Tower. During the battle, they goad Rose about the fate of Kid Devil, whom they had earlier captured. Despite overwhelming numbers, they are unable to take down Rose. Rose ruptures a gas line with her energy swords, blowing up a section of the tower. Rose is revealed to have survived the explosion by crossing the swords, creating a forcefield. She then follows the Terror Titans back to their base, saving Wonder Girl from Disruptor and Persuader. She then battles Clock King, her own precognitive powers matching him. Clock King offers Rose a place on his team, but she refuses. Clock King then ejects the Titans from his base. Back at the tower, Rose overhears Robin and Wonder Girl talking about her almost killing Persuader during battle, and deciding there will be \\"repercussions\\". Rose decides to leave the Titans, using one of Clock King's teleportation devices to do it. In Terror Titans #1, Ravager is seen talking with Clock King, negotiating her role within his group. She agrees to take part in one of The Dark Side Club's arena battles, fighting against Fever. Rose defeats Fever, but when given the order to finish her, refuses, prompting Clock King to have Fever shot in the head. Although appalled by Fever's death, Rose stays, hoping to find out what Clock King's plan is. Continuing to fight in the tournament, Rose faces off against Static, and is almost killed.Terror Titans #4 Rose eventually discover that Clock King intends to use the mind-controlled teen heroes as his own \\"Martyr Militia\\" to destroy Los Angeles, entirely for his own amusement. Attempting to get help, Rose is attacked by the Terror Titans, who overwhelm her.Terror Titans #5 Help comes in the form of Miss Martian, who had been posing as one of the brainwashed teens, and had managed to use her telepathy to free them. Ravager follows the retreating villains back to their base, where she confronts Clock King. Despite their equal precognitive abilities, Ravager is able to defeat him, although she was unable to prevent his escape.Terror Titans #6 Ravager returns during the Teen Titans/Titans/Vigilante crossover \\"Deathtrap\\", seeking to save Jericho, who had been targeted by Vigilante. However, the unbalanced Jericho refuses her offer of help, continuing in his plot to kill the Titans, forcing Rose to team up with the heroes to stop him.Teen Titans vol. 3, #70 It is also apparent that she has become addicted to the adrenaline given to her by the Clock King. Following the \\"Deathtrap\\" storyline, Rose briefly tries her hand at being a part of the Titans, but finds that she does not belong with them. After an altercation with Bombshell, staged to ensure her loyalty to the team, Rose leaves to find her own way in life.Teen Titans vol. 3, #71 From Teen Titans #72 onwards, Ravager is featured in a 10-page, 9 part co-feature, Ravager: Fresh Hell, written by Sean McKeever and drawn by Yildiray Cinar. In the Teen Titans tie-in to the Blackest Night crossover, Rose tracks Deathstroke down to his old mentor Wintergreen's house and attacks him. During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as Black Lanterns. When Grant attacks Deathstroke, intending to burn him in a fireplace, Rose reluctantly intervenes, saving her hated father. She then attempts to incinerate Wade, but is surprised when Jericho jumps out of his body.Teen Titans vol. 3, #77 (November 2009) Jericho, whose eyes had grown back since Vigilante's attack, uses his powers to make the Black Lanterns destroy themselves. After the battle, Rose refuses to reconcile with Deathstroke, despite acknowledging her daughterly love for him. She also realises that her mother may still be alive, as she was not among the attacking Black Lanterns.Teen Titans vol. 3, #78 (December 2009) Following an adventure in another dimension, Static, Miss Martian, Bombshell, and Aquagirl leave the Titans, and Rose is invited to rejoin the team in order to help build it back up. While staying in the Tower, Rose hacks into the team computer and begins searching for information on her mother.Teen Titans vol. 3, #88 During her time with the group, Rose begins flirting with Superboy, and befriends Damian Wayne, the new Robin. She remains with the team up until the final battle with Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Doom, where she teams with Speedy to take down Persuader, one of her former teammates on the Terror Titans. She and Damian also help turn the tide of the battle by using a piece of Kryptonite to destroy several evil clones of Superboy.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #98-100 =The New 52= Following the events of \\"Flashpoint\\", the DC Universe was relaunched. In the New 52, Rose now has both eyes intact and does not go by the name Ravager, though she still appears to have her martial arts training and trademark swords. She is a teenaged mercenary hired by the shadowy organization N.O.W.H.E.R.E. to act as a handler for Superboy after he destroyed the N.O.W.H.E.R.E. lab used to create him in self-defense. Rose has a rivalry with Caitlin Fairchild, a young N.O.W.H.E.R.E. researcher who cares for Superboy.Superboy #1 (September 2011) Her origin is altered so that she is now the daughter of Slade Wilson and his wife Adeline Kane, removing her Asian heritage in the process. After last seen by the side of her father Deathstroke, following the events that happened in The Ravagers, she reappears in a possible future 20 years distant. In this timeline she is along her husband Garfield Logan, now labeled as Beast Man, living together in the Justice League Watchtower as Beast Man is the only Justice Leaguer alive. The two also have a daughter named Red who is being mentored by them along other superpowered teenagers in order for them to become a team. After an encounter with three members of the Teen Titans from the present Red Robin, Wonder Girl and Superboy, Rose and Gar put in action a plan to swap Superboy (Kon-El) with the man of whom he is a clone (Jon Lane Kent, son of Superman and Lois Lane), who is responsible for the tragedy that happened in that future, in order to prevent those events from happening again. The plan is a success as Raven's soul-self departs with the Titans from the present and the unconscious Jon Lane, not Conner. Once alone, Rose asks Gar if they really did the right thing, which Gar responds: \\"I damn well hope so Rose. I damn well hope so\\".Teen Titans Annual #2 (2013) =DC Rebirth= Rose later reappears after the DC Rebirth relaunch, with her original Cambodian origin and mixed-race heritage now restored.Deathstroke (vol. 4) #2 She is seen working as a strip club bouncer who moonlights as a teenage mercenary, and reunites with her father after someone puts a hit on her. Her past in the New 52 continuity also appears to be retconned, as she makes no mention of N.O.W.H.E.R.E., and claims to have been trained by Nightwing, much to Slade's annoyance.Deathstroke (vol. 4) #3 Powers and abilities =Original powers= Injected with the same serum that enhanced her father Deathstroke, Rose has increased reflexes, stamina, and strength, but is also prone to psychotic episodes, such as when she gouged out her own eye to be more like her father. She has received some training from Nightwing, including the virtues of being a hero. She also possesses a precognitive sense that lets her see into the immediate future. This allows her to react to oncoming attacks against her and to counter them accordingly. She currently wields twin energy katanas that can cut through anything except flesh, and briefly merge into an energy shield. She also carries with her a small stash of adrenaline, both because Clock King had briefly managed to make her addicted to the substance, and also because while high on adrenaline her precognitive sense evolves into the ability to glimpse scenes from her immediate future. However, the more she uses adrenaline to enhance her powers, the more her metabolism is unbalanced, straining her health. =The New 52/Rebirth= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the source of Rose's powers are metagenes. She can dampen another person's powers and abilities such as weakening invulnerability and do damage to people such as Superboy or Mister Majestic.Deathstroke vol. 2 #20 She also has psionic powers, that make her immune to Jericho's possession abilities and Superboy's telekinesis.Superboy vol. 6 #7 These facilities also psychically link her to other Gen-Actives, enabling multi-way mental communication with people enhanced by the Gen Factor.Ravagers vol. 1 #2-6 The limits of these powers are still unknown. In Rebirth publishing, Ravager reacquires her old superhuman skill set prior to Flashpoint. The only difference being she now derives her abilities from the hereditary metagene begotten from her father, which became active due to prolonged exposure to Mr. Wilson's sword; The Deathstroke.Deathstroke Vol. 4 #10 Retaining the enhanced conditional practices of superhuman strength, durability, agility, healing, etc. She also had been bestowed a unique variation of the enhanced mind her father possessed; beyond the simple augmented brain percentage giving Deathstroke his genius intellect, Rose has an accelerated probability factor wherein she can predict the future via cataloging and assembling details in a highly accurate outcome assessment.Deathstroke Vol. 4 #10 Other versions =Teen Titans (TV series)= While Rose never appeared in the Teen Titans animated series, she appeared as the antagonist in an issue of the tie-in comic, Teen Titans Go! issue #49. As Ravager, she returns to Jump City, hoping to claim \\"what is rightfully hers\\". Ravager finds and attacks Wintergreen and Professor Chang, both of whom had something which belonged to her father. After blowing up Chang's robot factory, she goes on a rampage in Jump City, determined to carry on her father's legacy by defeating the Teen Titans once and for all. After a duel with Robin, the Titans help her understand that she does not have to carry on her father's legacy and offer her a home and a family while convincing her that she is free to make her own decisions in life. Touched by the Titans' words of friendship, she decides to frequently train (but not officially join) with them until she is ready to face her future as a better person.Teen Titans Go! #49 =Titans Tomorrow= In the \\"Titans Tomorrow\\" storyline, the Teen Titans are thrown back in time after teaming up with the Legion of Super-Heroes, only to arrive ten years into their own future. They discover that as adults, they are evil authoritarian dictators. However, a Titans East team has been formed to stop them. Rose Wilson is a member of the Titans East and is in love with Bart Allen, then the Flash, who is spying on the evil Titans. Rose and the Flash help the Teen Titans to return home. The concept is revisited in Teen Titans vol. 3, where it revealed that the future has changed somewhat. Future Bart Allen is now just as unscrupulous as his teammates, and Rose's counterpart is dead. There exists no Titans East/Titans West division, as all belong to a greatly expanded teammates Titans Army.Teen Titans vol. 3, #51-54 =Tiny Titans= Rose appears in Tiny Titans, although she does not go by Ravager.

This version is a prophetic pirate and uses her abilities to predict the moves of her opponents and to warn her comrades not to stray from the Belle Reeve Manor.

These lakes are Bekuan (area 1,268 hectares), Belida (600 ha), Genali (2,000 ha), Keleka Tangai (756 ha), Luar (5,208 ha), Pengembung (1,548 ha), Sambor (673 ha), Sekawi (672 ha), Sentarum (2,324 ha), Sependan (604 ha), Seriang (1,412) Sumbai (800 ha), Sumpa (664) and Tekenang (1,564 ha).MacKinnon, pp. 152, 159 When the monthly precipitation exceeds about , the river overflows its banks, diverting much of its waters to the lakes at a rate of up to , and forming a single volume of water with them. This outflow prevents massive flooding of the lower reaches of the river; it also promotes fish migration from the river to the lakes for spawning, but drives birds away from the lakes. The river discharges into the South China Sea creating a marshy delta, which spreads both inland and into the sea, with the silt deposits extending up to from the Borneo coast. The delta is located west-southwest of Pontianak, the capital of West Kalimantan province, which lies at the equator. The delta has five arms, of which the northernmost one is the widest, and is therefore called the Big Kapuas (). The largest tributary is the Melawi River, which occurs to the left near the city of Sintang, about 465 km from the mouth. Other major tributaries are the Landak, Kubu, Punggur and Sekayam rivers.South Kalimantan Climate The climate is warm and very humid, with the average annual precipitation ranging from year to year between , and the number of rainy days between 120 and 309; the largest precipitation was observed in 1976 (120 rainy days) and the wettest in 1988, with only 184 rainy days. The temperature is rather stable with a typical minimum of and maximum of through the whole year.Pontianak, Borneo Climate. ClimaTemps.com  Flora and fauna  A bridge on the outskirts of Pontianak In the upper and middle reaches, the river flows through dense tropical forests; the rich flora and fauna are the subject of international research. Discoveries of new species are frequent, such as of the Kapuas mud snake (Enhydris gyii), which was discovered in 2003‚Äì2005 by German and American herpetologists. This species is remarkable in that it can spontaneously change its skin color, similar to the chameleon. Otters and crocodiles are common in the Kapuas River, but frogs are nearly absent.MacKinnon, p. 162 Agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis), M√ºller's Bornean gibbons (Hylobates muelleri), Prevost's squirrels (Callosciurus prevostii) and treeshrews inhabit the trees above the river.MacKinnon, pp. 52‚Äì53 There are two national parks on the river banks, Betung Kerihun with an area of 8,000 km2 and Danau Sentarum (area 1,320 km2), the latter includes the Kapuas Lakes. =Fish= The super red arowana, either considered a variant of the Asian arowana or its own species, is only found in Kapuas About 300 species of fish have been identified in the river basin, of which 234 are of high economical value. This is more fish species than any other river basin in Indonesia. They belong to 120 genera and 40 families with the two major groups being cyprinids and catfish. More than 30% of the species originate from the sea and inhabit the delta areas.MacKinnon, p. 143 Among the economically important species are food fish such as Pangasius catfish, giant gourami, kissing gourami, snakeheads and large barbs (Leptobarbus, Puntioplites, Tor and others), and species from the aquarium trade such as the super red arowana and rasboras. Because of overfishing and habitat degradation, several species are threatened. Among these are the endangered arowana and white-edge freshwater whipray, and the wallago catfish, which formerly migrated in large groups in the Kapuas River. Part of the high species diversity in the Kapuas is related to the many different habitats in the river basin. In the headwaters are fast- flowing highland streams, typically dominated by small loaches, and small ‚Äîoften acidic (blackwater)‚Äî forest streams and peat swamps with species such as the tiny Sundadanio rasboras and macropodusine gouramis. The main river itself also includes several habitats, ranging from the nearshore to open waters. In the deepest sections, no light exists and in one species, Lepidocephalus spectrum, this has resulted in a complete reduction of both eyes and pigmentation (similar to cavefish). Female Hemirhamphodon pogonognathus, about long Owing to the warm climate and abundance of food, most fishes breed all through the year with only a few species like fire eel (Mastacembelus erythrotaenia) having certain reproduction periods. The number of individuals per species is relatively low. The large variety of species may be explained by the fact that some 6,000 years ago, the Kapuas River, as a tributary of the Sunda River, was connected to other tributary rivers of South Sumatra, Java and Malay Peninsula. Apart from fish, there are numerous crabs, prawns, water striders and other aquatic insects.MacKinnon, p. 132 The rich flora and fauna results in very complex food chains, with fishes consuming foods ranging from fruits to other fish. For example, Hemirhamphodon pogonognathus feeds exclusively on terrestrial insects. Abundant fruits and seeds enter the river after falling from large trees which bend over its waters.MacKinnon, p. 161 The feeding habits of the fish in the Kapuas River are distributed as follows: 54% are omnivores; 36% are carnivorous and eat other fish (14%), insects (5%) and mixed small forest animals (17%). The remaining 10% are herbivorous, with 4% of them specialising in algae.  Transport and economic value  The Kapuas River is the major waterway connecting the center of the island with its western coast. The large river width and depth (up to 27 meters) support intensive cargo and passenger shipping over most of the river length. Ships with a draft of up to 3 meters can navigate up to Sintang, 465 km from the mouth, and those with a draft up to 2 meters can reach the town of Putussibau (902 km from the mouth). Logging and rafting of timber occur all along the river. Fishing is also common, especially at the Kapuas Lakes and near the river delta.MacKinnon, p. 457 The Tayan Bridge, opened in 2016, crosses over the river and is the longest bridge in Kalimantan.

Avoidance speech is found in many Australian Aboriginal languages and Austronesian languages as well as some North American languages, Highland East Cushitic languages and Bantu languages. Avoidance speech styles tend to have the same phonology and grammar as the standard language they are a part of. The lexicon, however, tends to be smaller than in normal speech since the styles are only used for limited communication. Australia Avoidance speech in Australian Aboriginal languages is closely tied to elaborate tribal kinship systems in which certain relatives are considered taboo. Avoidance relations differ from tribe to tribe in terms of strictness and to whom they apply. Typically, there is an avoidance relationship between a man and his mother-in-law, usually between a woman and her father-in-law, and sometimes between any person and their parent-in-law of the same sex. For some tribes, avoidance relationships are extended to other family members, such as the mother-in-law's brother in Warlpiri or cross-cousins in Dyirbal. All relations are classificatory ‚Äì more people may fall into the \\"mother-in- law\\" category than just a man's wife's mother. Avoidance speech styles used with taboo relatives are often called mother-in-law languages, although they are not actually separate languages but separate lexical sets with the same grammar and phonology. Typically, the taboo lexical set has a one-to-many correspondence with the everyday set. For example, in Dyirbal the avoidance style has one word, jijan, for all lizards and iguanas while the everyday style differentiates many varieties. In Guugu Yimidhirr the avoidance speech verb bali-l \\"travel\\" covers several everyday verbs meaning \\"go\\", \\"walk\\", \\"crawl\\", \\"paddle\\", \\"float, sail, drift\\", and \\"limp along\\". Corresponding avoidance and everyday words are generally not linguistically related. Avoidance forms tend to be longer than everyday forms. In some areas, the avoidance style is used by both members of the avoidance relationship; in others the senior member may talk to the junior in everyday style. Behavior associated with avoidance speech is a continuum and varies between tribes. For the Dyirbal people, a man and his mother-in-law may not make eye contact, face one another or directly talk to each other. Rather, they must address a third person or even a nearby object. For slightly less restricted relationships, such as between a man and his father-in-law, avoidance style is used and must be spoken in a slow, soft voice. An extreme case of avoidance behavior is found in the Umpila, in which a man and his mother-in-law may not speak at all in each other‚Äôs presence. Children in these cultures acquire avoidance speech forms as part of their normal language development, learning with whom to use them at a fairly young age. Additionally, a few languages have another style, called a \\"secret language\\" or \\"mystic language\\", that is taught to boys as part of initiation rituals, and is only used between men. There is also the tradition of avoiding reference to the names of people who have died during the mourning period as a mark of respect‚Äîand also because it is considered too painful for the grieving family. Today the practice continues in many communities, but has also come to encompass avoiding the publication or dissemination of photography or film footage of the deceased as well. Most forms of media in Australia include a disclaimer warning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders that the material may contain images and voices of such people who have died. (as recommended by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation). The avoidance period may last anywhere from 12 months to several years. The person can still be referred to in a roundabout way, such as, \\"that old lady\\", or by their generic skin name, but not by first name. In some Central Australian communities, if for example, an individual named Alice dies, that name must be avoided in all contexts. This can even include the township Alice Springs being referred to in conversation in a roundabout way (which is usually fine, as the Indigenous name can be defaulted to). Those of the same name as the deceased are referred to by a substitute name during the avoidance period such as Kuminjay, used in the Pintubi-Luritja dialect, or Galyardu, which appears in a mid-western Australia Wajarri dictionary for this purpose. Africa A special system of avoidance vocabulary is traditionally used by married women speaking Highland East Cushitic languages in southwestern Ethiopia. In Kambaata and Sidamo, this system is called ballishsha, and includes physical and linguistic avoidance of parents-in-law. Women who practice ballishsha do not pronounce any words beginning with the same syllable as the name of their husband‚Äôs mother or father. Instead, they may use paraphrase, synonyms or semantically similar words, antonyms, or borrowings from other languages. Hlonipha, or isihlonipho, is a traditional system of avoidance speech in Nguni Bantu languages and Sotho of southern Africa including Zulu, Xhosa and Swazi and Sotho. This special speech style and correlating respectful behaviors may be used in many contexts, but is most strongly associated with married women in respect to their father-in-law and other senior male relatives. Women who practice hlonipha may not say the names of these men or any words with the same root as their names. They avoid the taboo words phonologically (substituting sounds) or lexically (substituting words with synonyms, etc.). The hlonipha system also includes avoidance of the names of certain relatives by all speakers and physical avoidance of certain relatives.

While in the WWE, their ring personas were those of a duo of superheroes. In mid-2003, The Hurricane \\"discovered\\" Rosey and from there on they wrestled together as a team. Two years later, they won the World Tag Team Championship. During that time, The Hurricane and Rosey joined forces with Stacy Keibler, who adopted a superhero ring persona and the name Super Stacy. After losing the World Tag Team title, the team disbanded. History Shortly after Rosey's old tag team partner Jamal was released from WWE in 2003, The Hurricane \\"discovered\\" Rosey's potential as a superhero, and christened him Rosey, the Super Hero in Training (or the S.H.I.T.). Throughout this time, Rosey came to the ring clad in makeshift superhero costumes, with each clearly depicting the S.H.I.T. reference on the front, and skits aired weekly showing Rosey training to be a superhero. The Hurricane and Rosey began teaming together, and competed sporadically on Raw, making more regular appearances on Heat. They faced the teams of Chris Jericho and Christian and Evolution, before beginning a long-running feud (scripted rivalry) with La R√©sistance. The feud continued for most of 2004, and The Hurricane and Rosey faced La R√©sistance several times on Raw and pay-per-view, including at Backlash. On the July 19, 2004 episode of Raw, Rosey appeared with a new costume, showing that he seemingly graduated to a full superhero. The Hurricane and Rosey finished out the year competing against teams including Rhyno and Tajiri and Val Venis and Steven Richards. =World Tag Team Champions= World Tag Team Champion In early 2005 at May's pay-per-view event Backlash, The Hurricane and Rosey won the World Tag Team Championship in a Tag Team Turmoil match after defeating then-champions Tajiri and William Regal, The Heart Throbs (Romeo and Antonio), Simon Dean and Maven and La R√©sistance (Rob√©rt Conway and Sylvain Grenier) by last eliminating La R√©sistance. During this time, the team successfully retained the championship against various teams, including La R√©sistance, Simon Dean and Maven, and The Heart Throbs. While on Raw, Stacy Keibler joined forces with The Hurricane and Rosey, acting as their valet. She accompanied them to the ring wearing a mask and superhero costume of her own, calling herself \\"Super Stacy\\" until she was traded to the SmackDown! brand on August 22. On the September 5, 2005 episode of Raw, The Hurricane and Rosey were defeated by the team of Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in Cade and Murdoch's debut match for the brand. Although this was a non-title match, the pair earned themselves a title match at the September pay-per-view, Unforgiven. During the title match at the event, Murdoch delivered an elevated DDT on The Hurricane outside the ring. The DDT caused The Hurricane to suffer a storyline \\"stinger\\" and allowed Cade and Murdoch to beat the injured Hurricane later in the match to win the World Tag Team Championship. =Split and aftermath= Stacy Keibler, as \\"Super Stacy\\", was the valet for The Hurricane and Rosey in 2005 The loss of the World Tag Team Championship signalled the end of the team; in the following weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by The Hurricane's injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle at the request of Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey (who had come to the ring to his aid). The following week, The Hurricane did not show up in a World Tag Team title match leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared at the top of the entrance ramp, now going by his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd and that he had been carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. Helms requested a match with Rosey, and defeated him with a shining wizard to end their partnership permanently. This was one of Rosey's last matches with WWE, as he was released shortly thereafter while Helms went on to win his third Cruiserweight Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble in January, resulting in Helms returning to the SmackDown! roster and subsequently establishing himself outside The Hurricane identity, while Stacy Keibler left WWE in early 2006.

Lee Thompson and starring Deborah Kerr, David Niven and Sharon Tate. The film is set in rural France and was filmed at the Ch√¢teau de Hautefort and in England. Eye of the Devil is based on the novel Day of the Arrow by Robin Estridge and was initially titled Thirteen. Plot from the film's trailer David Niven plays the owner of a vineyard, who is called back to the estate when it falls on hard times. Accompanied by his wife (Deborah Kerr), the couple are confronted by a beautiful witch (Sharon Tate), who also lives on the estate with her brother (David Hemmings). As time passes it becomes clear that a blood sacrifice is expected to return the vineyard to its former glory.

The New York Times praised it for telling the story from a male point of view, but said the ending would not surprise anyone who had read The Golden Bough. Film rights were bought by Martin Ransohoff of Filmways, who had a multi-picture deal with MGM. The script was written by Robin Estridge, author of the novel. Terry Southern was brought in to do an uncredited \\"tighting and brightning\\" of the screenplay. Kim Novak was signed to play the lead. (Novak had signed a three-picture deal with Ransohoff in 1961.) David Niven joined her as co-star. It was the first feature film for Sharon Tate who had been discovered by Ransohoff when she went to audition for Petticoat Junction; he was impressed and put her under a seven-year contract. Tate had spent months studying and playing small roles at Ransohoff's expense before making her debut. \\"Everybody should make an effort to show a new face in every major picture,\\" said Ransohoff. The original director was Sidney J. Furie, who had signed a three-picture deal with Ransohoff. In August 1965, shortly before filming was to begin, Furie was replaced by Michael Anderson. When Anderson fell ill, he was replaced in turn by J. Lee Thompson. Shortly before filming started the title of the movie was changed to 13. =Shooting= Filming started on 13 September 1965. In November, with only two weeks of shooting to be completed, Novak injured her back in a riding incident. While doing an important scene on location in France, she was thrown from a horse. The film was shut down while Novak sought treatment. She tried to resume filming two weeks later but was exhausted after only one day of work and was unable to go on. \\"There is no permanent damage to Kim's back,\\" said her husband Richard Johnson. \\"It is not something that will trouble her for the rest of her life. She will recover eventually. It is going to take time and will not be an easy matter.\\" (Novak later said the injury was a broken vertebra.) \\"It is tragic, but without Kim or a replacement, we cannot go on,\\" said David Niven. \\"The person I feel most sorry for is director J. Lee Thompson. He has put everything into this picture.\\" She was replaced by Deborah Kerr. As a result, many scenes had to be reshot, with Novak seen only in some long shots. However, David Hemmings recalls in his autobiography that he witnessed a bitter argument between Kim Novak and Martin Ransohoff near the end of filming led Kim Novak to be sacked and the film to be reshot with Deborah Kerr. Filming resumed with Kerr in December. When asked what it was like to act with such a distinguished cast Tate said \\"Of course I was nervous but I was flattered rather than intimidated because everybody put me at such ease. They are such pros. You don't see their technique but when you are surrounded by the best it brings out the best in you.\\" To give the pagan rites some authenticity, Alex Sanders, an English occultist and Wiccan, was hired as a consultant to the film. Critical reception and box office The film features the debut performance of Sharon Tate, cast by Filmways executive Martin Ransohoff, who hailed her as his great discovery. The film attracted little attention and had little impact on Tate's career. A The New York Times review referred to Tate's \\"chillingly beautiful but expressionless\\" performance. Although Eye of the Devil was not a commercial success in the United States when first released, it was popular in Europe, and it has acquired a degree of cult status, largely due to its surreal themes, and the 1969 murder of Tate. The film is also notable for its distinguished supporting cast, which includes veteran actors Donald Pleasence, Flora Robson, Emlyn Williams, Edward Mulhare and John Le Mesurier. In 1968 the film was listed as one of only three Ransohoff films that did not make money, the other two being Don't Make Waves and The Loved One. DVD Eye of the Devil was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on 21 February 2011 via its Warner Archive DVD-on- demand service as a Region 1 widescreen DVD.

In the United States, bursars usually exist only at the level of higher education (four-year colleges and universities) or at private secondary schools. In Australia, Great Britain, and other countries, bursars are common at lower levels of education. Duties The bursar is responsible for billing of student tuition accounts. This responsibility involves sending bills and making payment plans; the ultimate goal is to bring all student accounts to a \\"paid off\\" status. Bursars are not necessarily involved in the financial aid process. Bursars' duties vary from one institution to another. At many institutions, bursars deal only with student finances. At other institutions, bursars also deal with some faculty finance issues. Elsewhere, they also oversee accounts receivable, or the payments that the university receives from outside organizations for which it performs services. In some institutions, all money held by the institution is the bursar's responsibility. Some bursars (in the UK for instance) also have responsibility for payroll, investments, facilities, IT, human resources, health and safety and oversight of administrative functions at an institution. The bursar statement is also known as a tuition bill or a student account bill. The bursar often reports to a comptroller. For example, Barnard College employs an Associate Comptroller‚ÄìBursar.Barnard College Bursar's webpage In other cases, the bursar has the same level as the comptroller, and both report to the director or vice president of finance.

Biography =Early life= Raised and educated in Memphis, Clement was performing at an early age, playing guitar and Dobro. Before embarking on a career in music, he served in the United States Marines. In 1953, he made his first record for Sheraton Records in Boston, Massachusetts, but he did not immediately pursue a full-time career in music, instead choosing to study at Memphis State University from 1953 to 1955. Nicknamed \\"Cowboy\\" Jack Clement, during his student days, he played steel guitar with a local band. In 1956, Clement was part of one of the seminal events in rock-and-roll history when he was hired as a producer and engineer for Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Subsequently, Clement worked with future stars such as Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Most notably, he discovered and recorded Jerry Lee Lewis while Phillips was away on a trip to Florida. One of those recordings, \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\", was selected in 2005 for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress. =Career= In 1957, Clement wrote the song \\"Ballad of a Teenage Queen\\", which became a crossover hit for Johnny Cash. Other Cash hits written by Clement include \\"Guess Things Happen That Way\\", which was No. 1 on the country chart and No. 11 on the pop chart in 1958, and the comedic \\"The One on the Right Is on the Left\\", which was a No. 2 country and No. 46 pop hit in 1966. Clement also produced (and came up with the horn intro) Cash's No. 1 hit, \\"Ring of Fire,\\" in 1963. Clement performed \\"Guess Things Happen That Way\\" on the \\"Johnny Cash Memorial Tribute\\" on CMT (Country Music Television) in November 2003. In 1958, Clement released the single \\"Ten Years\\",Billboard, June 2, 1958. p. 48: \\"Jack Clement ... has made his vocal debut on Sun with \\"Ten Years\\" and \\"Your Lover Boy\\", which was covered by Johnny Western (1959), Rex Allen (1962) and Roger Mews. In 1959, Clement accepted an offer to work as a producer at RCA Victor in Nashville, then the most important label in the record industry. In 1961, he moved to Beaumont, Texas, joining the producer and publisher Bill Hall in opening the Gulf Coast Recording Studio and the Hall-Clement publishing company. He returned to Nashville permanently in 1965, becoming a significant figure in the country music business, establishing a publishing business, and founding a recording studio, making records for stars such as Charley Pride and Ray Stevens. In 1971, he co-founded JMI Records, which can be credited with launching the career of Don Williams. Clement wrote a number of highly successful songs that have been recorded by singing stars such as Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Ray Charles, Carl Perkins, Bobby Bare, Elvis Presley, Jim Reeves, Jerry Lee Lewis, Cliff Richard (\\"It'll Be Me\\"), Charley Pride, Tom Jones, Dickey Lee and Hank Snow. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1973. He also produced albums by Townes Van Zandt and Waylon Jennings. Clement was involved in a few film projects as a singer or songwriter of soundtracks. He produced the 1975 horror film Dear Dead Delilah, the last film performance by the actress Agnes Moorehead. =Later life= In 1987, Clement was approached by U2 to record at Sun Studio in Memphis. Clement was then oblivious to U2's catalog, but nonetheless agreed to arrange the session upon the urging of someone in his office. The result was a portion of the U2 album Rattle and Hum (\\"When Love Comes to Town\\", with BB King; \\"Angel of Harlem\\", a tribute to Billie Holiday; and \\"Love Rescue Me\\", with backing vocals by Bob Dylan), as well as the Woody Guthrie song \\"Jesus Christ\\", which was included on the 1988 album Folkways: A Vision Shared‚ÄîA Tribute to Woody Guthrie & Leadbelly. Portions of the two sessions also appear in the film Rattle and Hum. In 2005, a documentary about Clement, Shakespeare Was a Big George Jones Fan, was created by Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville, pieced together from Clement's home videos and interviews with peers, including Jerry Lee Lewis and Bono. Clement hosted a weekly program on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. He was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and the Music City Walk of Fame. On June 25, 2011, a fire destroyed his home and studio on Belmont Boulevard in Nashville. Clement was unhurt, but many priceless recordings and memorabilia were lost. On April 10, 2013, it was announced Clement would be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Clement died at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, on August 8, 2013. He had suffered from liver cancer. He had two children, a daughter, Alison, also a singer and writer, and a son, Niles, an engineer and photographer.

Oblates are individuals, either laypersons or clergy, normally living in general society, who, while not professed monks or nuns, have individually affiliated themselves with a monastic community of their choice. They make a formal, private promise (annually renewable or for life, depending on the monastery with which they are affiliated) to follow the Rule of the Order in their private lives as closely as their individual circumstances and prior commitments permit. Such oblates are considered an extended part of the monastic community; for example, Benedictine oblates also often include the post-nominal letters 'OblSB' or 'ObSB' after their names on documents. They are comparable to the tertiaries associated with the various mendicant orders. The term \\"oblate\\" is also used in the official name of some religious institutes as an indication of their sense of dedication. Origins and history The word oblate (from the Latin oblatus - someone who has been offered) has had various particular uses at different periods in the history of the Christian church. The children vowed and given by their parents to the monastic life, in houses under the Rule of St. Benedict, were commonly known by this term during the century and a half after its writing, when the custom was in vogue, and the councils of the Church treated them as monks. This practice continued until the Tenth Council of Toledo in 656 forbade their acceptance before the age of ten and granted them free permission to leave the monastery, if they wished, when they reached the age of puberty. The term puer oblatus (used after that Council) labels an oblate who had not yet reached puberty and thus had a future opportunity to leave the monastery, though puer oblatus can also refer to someone entering an abbey. At a later date the term \\"oblate\\" designated such lay men or women as were pensioned off by royal and other patrons upon monasteries or benefices, where they lived as in an almshouse or homes. In the 11th century, Abbot William of Hirschau or Hirsau (died 1091), in the old diocese of Spires, introduced two kinds of lay brethren into the monastery: # the fratres barbati or conversi, who took vows but were not claustral or enclosed monks # the oblati, workmen or servants who voluntarily subjected themselves, while in the service of the monastery, to religious obedience and observance. Afterwards, the different status of the lay brother in the several orders of monks, and the ever-varying regulations concerning him introduced by the many reforms, destroyed the distinction between the conversus and the oblatus. The Cassinese Benedictines, for instance, at first carefully differentiated between conversi, commissi and oblati; the nature of the vows and the forms of the habits were in each case specifically distinct. The conversus, the lay brother properly so called, made solemn vows like the choir monks, and wore the scapular; the commissus made simple vows, and was dressed like a monk, but without the scapular; the oblatus made a vow of obedience to the abbot, gave himself and his goods to the monastery, and wore a sober secular dress. But in 1625, we find the conversus reduced below the status of the commissus, inasmuch as he could make only simple vows for a year at a time; he was in fact indistinguishable, except by his dress, from the oblatus of a former century. Then, in the later Middle Ages, oblatus, confrater, and donatus became interchangeable titles, given to any one who, for his generosity or special service to the monastery, received the privilege of lay membership, with a share in the prayers and good works of the brethren. Canonically, only two distinctions ever had any consequence: # that between those who entered religion \\"per modum professionis\\" and \\"per modum simplicis conversionis\\" the former being monachi and the latter oblati # that between the oblate who was \\"mortuus mundo\\" (\\"dead to the world,\\" that is, who had given himself and his goods to religion without reservation), and the oblate who retained some control over his person and his possessions ‚Äì the former only (plene oblatus) was accounted a persona ecclesiastica, with enjoyment of ecclesiastical privileges and immunity (Benedict XIV, \\"De Synodo Dioce.\\", VI). Oblates today =Secular oblates = In modern practice, many Benedictine communities have a greater or smaller number of secular oblates. These are either clergy or laypeople affiliated in prayer with an individual monastery of their choice, who have made a formal private promise (annually renewable or for life) to follow the Rule of St Benedict in their private life at home and at work as closely as their individual circumstances and prior commitments permit. In the Roman Catholic Church the oblate is in an individual relationship with the monastic community and does not form a distinct unit within the Church, there are no regulations in the modern canon law of the Church regarding them. One consequence is that non-Catholic Christians can be received as oblates of a Catholic monastery. Similarly in Methodist monasteries, non-Methodist Christians can be received as oblates. The same is the case with many Anglican monasteries, which accept non-Anglican Christians as oblates. By contrast, the Eastern Orthodox require that Oblates be baptized in the Orthodox faith and in good standing with their local parish. =Conventual oblates= There is a small number of conventual or claustral oblates, who reside in a monastic community. If the person has not done so previously, after a year's probation they make a simple commitment of their lives to the monastery, which is received by the superior in the presence of the whole community. More on the level of committed volunteers, they would share in the life of the community and undertake, without remuneration, any work or service required of them. They are not, however, considered monks or nuns themselves. Often they wear a religious habit similar to, but distinct from, that of the monks or nuns. A conventual oblate may cancel this commitment at any time; and it is canceled automatically if the superior sends the oblate away for good reason, after simple consultation with the chapter. Religious congregations that use \\"Oblate\\" in their name There are several religious orders (i.e., living the consecrated life according to Church Law) that use the word \\"Oblate\\" in their name, or in an extended version of their common name. These are not oblates like the oblates (secular) and (regular), and should not be confused with them. Examples include the: *Oblates of St. Francis de Sales *Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate *Oblates of the Virgin Mary *Oblates of St Frances of Rome (founded 1433 in Italy, as a community of professed oblates living in common) *Oblate Sisters of Providence *Oblates of St. Joseph *Oblate Missionaries of Mary Immaculate, a female secular institute Notable oblates Saint Boniface * Bede * St. Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor * St. Hildegard of Bingen * St. Frances of Rome * The Servant of God Dorothy Day * Kathleen Norris (poet) * Walker Percy * Gottschalk of Orbais * Cardinal Francis Eugene George, O.M.I. * Saint Bishop Eugene de Mazenod, O.M.I. * Cardinal Jean-Marie Rodrigue Villeneuve, O.M.I.

Total Demand for this seafood is a convex function of household income, making it a superior good. Superior goods or luxury goods make up a larger proportion of consumption as income rises, and therefore are a type of normal goods in consumer theory. Such a good must possess two economic characteristics: it must be scarce, and, along with that, it must have a high price.Shellfish Economics A course outline for the FAO of the United Nations; Fisheries and Aquaculture Department. Retrieved April 18, 2008. The scarcity of the good can be natural or artificial; however, the general population (i.e., consumers) must recognize the good as distinguishably better. Possession of such a good usually signifies \\"superiority\\" in resources, and usually is accompanied by prestige. A Veblen good is a superior goods with a prestige value so high that a price decline would lower demand. The income elasticity of a superior good is above one by definition, because it raises the expenditure share as income rises. A superior good also may be a luxury good that is not purchased at all below a certain level of income. Examples would include smoked salmon and caviar, and most other delicacies. On the other hand, superior goods may have a wide quality distribution, such as wine and holidays; however, though the number of such goods consumed may stay constant even with rising wealth, the level of spending will go up, to secure a better experience.  Confusion with normal goods  The choice of the word \\"superior\\" to define goods of this type suggests that they are the antonym of \\"inferior goods\\", but this is misleading; an inferior good can never be a superior good, but many goods are neither superior nor inferior. If the quantity of an item demanded increases with income, but not by enough to increase the share of the budget spent on it, then it is only a normal good and is not a superior good. Consumption of all normal goods increases as income increases. For example, if income increases by 50%, then consumption will increase (maybe by only 1%, maybe by 40%, maybe by 70%). A superior good is a normal good for which the proportional consumption increase exceeds the proportional income increase. So, if income increases by 50% then consumption of a superior good will increase by more than 50% (maybe 51%, maybe 70%). In economics terminology, all goods with an income elasticity of demand greater than zero are \\"normal\\", but only the subset having income elasticity of demand > 1 are \\"superior\\". Some texts on microeconomics use the term superior good as the sole alternative to an inferior good, making \\"superior goods\\" and \\"normal goods\\" synonymous. Where this is done, a product making up an increasing share of spending under income increases is often called an ultra-superior good.

The village gives its name to a Cardiff local authority electoral ward, Pentyrch, which covers the village and immediate surrounding area. The Pentyrch community includes the neighbouring village of Creigiau and Gwaelod y Garth. People living in Pentyrch are commonly known as \\"Penterchyians\\". Geography The village is situated next to the Garth Mountain, high above the River Taff. The village can be reached from junction 32 of the M4 Motorway, then A470, then via Heol Goch, a hill flanked by a quarry and nature reserve. Alternatively, Church Road provides access from Llantrisant Road near St Fagans. Other approaches are from Creigiau and Gwaelod-y-Garth. Demographics At the 2001 census, Pentyrch contained 3,535 individuals, in 1,358 households. Governance Pentyrch became the newest addition to the Cardiff unitary authority in 1996. The electoral ward of Pentyrch elects one councillor to Cardiff Council. It falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff West and is represented by the Labour Party in the Houses of Commons and the National Assembly. The ward is bounded by Rhondda Cynon Taf to the north; and by the wards of Whitchurch & Tongwynlais to the east; Radyr & Morganstown to the southeast; and Creigiau & St. Fagans to the southwest. =Local elections= Pentyrch was represented by Conservative councillor Craig Williams on Cardiff Council until he stepped down in 2015, following his election to Parliament for Cardiff North. A by-election for the Pentyrch ward took place on Tuesday 30 June 2015 which, despite a 27% swing to Plaid Cymru's Hywel Wigley, resulted in a narrow win for Conservative candidate Gavin Hill- John by 18 votes. At the Cardiff Council election on 4 May 2017 Cllr Hill-John successfully defended his seat, increasing the margin between himself and Hywel Wigley to 215 votes. The turnout was 56%. = Community Council = The Pentyrch Community Council has thirteen elected (or co-opted) members, representing the villages of Pentyrch, Creigiau (including Capel Llanilltern) and Gwaelod y Garth (the three community wards) on a ratio of 6:5:2. Elections are held every five years. 2017 Community Council Election Ten candidates (6 Independent, 3 Welsh Labour, 1 Plaid Cymru) stood for election during the 2017 Cardiff Council election. All candidates were therefore elected unopposed. The following by-elections took place between May 2017 and the next election in 2022.

A tributary of the Red River of the South, its headwaters rise on Pine Mountain in the Ouachita Mountains near the Arkansas border. From its source in LeFlore County, Oklahoma, it flows approximately U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 3, 2011 to its confluence with the Red River south at Hugo, Oklahoma. Name source The origin of the word Kiamichi is a matter of debate and may never be fully known. Most accounts say the word is a French word, which has been transliterated phonetically, for \\"horned screamer\\" or \\"noisy bird,\\" a reference to woodpeckers or other birds living along the river's banks. The spelling of the modern word was not standardized until the twentieth century, making its origin more difficult to determine. The Antlers News, a newspaper published in what was then Antlers, Indian Territory (now in Oklahoma) first used the spelling \\"Kiamichi\\" in November 1900. Prior to this, the newspaper, along with other authoritative sources, spelled the name of the river as \\"Kiamichia\\" or \\"Kiamitia\\" (the latter is closest to a French spelling).(George Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 117; Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, entry for Kiamichi River; Antlers News, November 22, 1900.) Muriel H. Wright suggested that Kaimichi may be from the French word kamichi, which meant \\"horned screamer\\", and possibly referred to the whooping cranes along the river.Wright, Muriel H. \\"Some Geographic Names of French Origin in Oklahoma.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Volume 7, Number 2, pp. 188-193. Accessed March 5, 2016. Other spellings of the name have included: Kiomitchie, Cayameechee, Kiamisha, Kimesha, Kimichy, and Kimishi. Another possibility could be the Kichai tribe of the area and dates back to time of Caddo indians. Geography From Pine Mountain the Kiamichi River flows southwest, past Talihina, Tuskahoma and Clayton to Antlers, where it turns abruptly southeast, flowing in this direction to its confluence with Red River. For much of its journey the river flows through the picturesque and highly defined Kiamichi River valley, framed by mountains of the same name. Pine Mountain, at approximately , is the highest, although the mountains lining its course, such as Flagpole Mountain at Clayton, are significant, rising generally between and . At Antlers the river meets the massive geological formation known as Standpipe Hill, forcing its turn to the southeast. From Antlers to the Red River the Kiamichi is generally characterized by flowing through a broad alluvial plain, particularly on its approach to the Red. The river or its tributaries is impounded by two lakes: Sardis Lake and Hugo Lake. Sardis Lake, named for the small settlement displaced during its construction, impounds Jack's Fork Creek. Hugo Lake, named for the nearby town of Hugo, impounds the river itself. Both are flood control reservoirs built and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Additional, smaller dams have impounded the waters of the tributaries over time, mostly for the purpose of powering sawmills and other light, localized industry. Notable geological features of the Kiamichi River valley include McKinley Rocks, the Potato Hills, Rock Town, and Lost Mountain. =Tributaries= Major tributaries of the Kiamichi River include Anderson Creek, Big Cedar Creek, Buck Creek, Buffalo Creek, Gates Creek, Jacks‚Äô Fork Creek, Pine Creek, Tenmile Creek and Waterhole Creek. Watershed =Drainage area= The area of the river's watershed is . History =Prehistoric era= The Kiamichi River defined its region during prehistoric days. Its valley provided the only convenient means of traversing the region from north to south‚Äîmuch as now‚Äîand Native American peoples used it as a corridor. The Native Americans who lived in the region prior to European colonization of the Americas were generally Caddo, who were nomads. The powerful Caddoan Mississippian culture based at Spiro Mounds held sway over the Kiamichi River valley, which formed a part of its trade network. Archeological finds across the Kiamichi River basin attest to early life in its valley. A prehistoric fish weir, or trap, in the river in Pushmataha County, excavated by the Oklahoma Archeological Survey, is a particularly revealing site. Ancient Indians diverted the flow of the river with walls of stone to create a chute into which fish would flow. Radiocarbon dating of charred hickory and pecan hulls found at the site indicate a date of approximately 1,200 BC. Also found were stumps of cypress trees, a tree which has not grown in that portion of the county in perhaps hundreds of years. Over 220 archeological sites have been identified in Pushmataha County alone, indicating how widespread ancient and more recent settlement was in the region prior to European settlement. Of those sites, three date from at least 8,000 years ago; 145 date from between 2,000-8,000 years ago; and 22 date from between 500‚Äì1000 years ago.(\\"Oklahoma's Past‚ÄîPushmataha County,\\" Oklahoma Archeological Survey, [www.ou.edu/cas/archsur/counties/push.htm]) =Modern era= Discovery by Europeans occurred in 1719, when French explorer Bernard de la Harpe explored the Kiamichi River valley. French explorers were quickly followed by French fur trappers; they named most of Oklahoma's rivers.(Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, plate 13) American explorers followed French ones, and were the first organized scientific surveys of the Kiamichi River. Thomas Nuttall traversed the Kiamichi and Little River valleys in 1819 and Stephen H. Long explored the Kiamichi River in 1821. Nuttall and Long were the precursors of empire; the region was actively settled by Choctaw Indians displaced from elsewhere in the United States starting in 1832.(Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, p. 16.) After the relocation of the Choctaw Nation to the Indian Territory in 1832, the river defined the political boundary or border between counties and districts. Forming an easily recognizable geographic frontier, it served in this capacity until Oklahoma's statehood in 1907, when the Choctaw Nation ceased to exist and its political subdivisions were eliminated. A Choctaw county was named after the river, although generally using the Choctaws‚Äô spelling, Kiamitia. The river formed the eastern boundary of Jack's Fork County and Kiamitia County, and the western boundary of Cedar County and Towson counties.(Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, p. 38.) Navigability of the Kiamichi River was an important goal but proved elusive due to a massive logjam in the Red River which prevented river traffic from going much beyond Nachitoches. In 1825 the Arkansas legislature petitioned the United States Congress to remove the Great Raft, as the logjam was called, so that boats could ply the Red River as far west as the mouth of the Kiamichi and the newly established Fort Towson. Within several years, the Army Corps of Engineers had done so.(Grant Foreman, \\"River Navigation in the Early Southwest,\\" The Mississippi Valley Historical Review, June 1928, p. 47.) Security along the Red River, the United States' (US) international frontier with the Spanish Empire was a concern, and the US established a chain of forts along the border. Fort Towson in the Choctaw Nation was one. It was built on Gates Creek near the mouth of the Kiamichi. A military road was built from Fort Smith to Fort Towson through the valley of Little River, switching to the Kiamichi River near its southern terminus. During the American Civil War, the last Confederate Army troops to surrender did so at Fort Towson on June 23, 1865. The Confederate States government had disintegrated by this time, and its individual armies surrendered one by one. While the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, Virginia signaled the end to the conflict, it did not truly end until the surrender of the last fighting Southern troops at Fort Towson. Transportation in the Kiamichi River valley was revolutionized between 1882 and 1887 with the construction of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad, commonly known as the Frisco. Part of a national network connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas with Paris, Texas, the railway was constructed parallel to the Kiamichi River from Talihina to Kellond, a small settlement three miles north of Antlers, Oklahoma.(Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, p. 64.) With the train came the telegraph and later the telephone. The coming of the Frisco stimulated settlement in the Choctaw Nation by European Americans and European immigrants. Population centers formed around each of the railroad's station stops, stimulated by trade and new markets. The river was important as a source of fresh, plentiful water for the trains, several of which ran daily. The frequent Frisco service encouraged developers to come for resource extraction. Timber companies and individual loggers soon moved in. Over the next several decades, they cleared the old-growth forest in the Kiamichi Mountains. Forestry remains the area's chief industry. Numerous rail spurs were developed from the Frisco outward along the creek valleys stretching away from the river. Large saw mill operations became common in the valleys for processing the lumber. During World War II, a training flight conducted by Britain's Royal Air Force‚Äîflying from a base in Texas‚Äîwent awry in poor weather and two planes crashed. One crashed into the south slope of White Rock Mountain above Moyers, Oklahoma, and another crashed on Big Mountain between Moyers and Kosoma. Two fliers lost their lives in the latter crash. In 2000 school children from Rattan, Oklahoma erected the AT6 Monument in their honor on Big Mountain. Also during World War II, the U.S. Navy honored the river with the launch of the USS Kiamichi, hull number AOG-73, built by St. Johns River Shipbuilding in Jacksonville, Florida. She launched on August 17, 1945, three days after the surrender of Japan. Because of the end of the war, completion of the ship was canceled on August 29. A Klickitat-class gasoline tanker, she was later completed for International Tankers of Panama. The ship was renamed Transmere in 1951 and in 1952 was sold to Colombia; it was renamed Sancho Jimeno.Navyhistory.com On October 29, 1961, President John F. Kennedy visited Big Cedar, east of Talihina, Oklahoma to give a speech marking the opening of U.S. Route 259.American Presidency Project, John F. Kennedy, speech #441, presidency.ucsb.edu In August 1975 the Kiamichi River made national news when its bottomlands were the scene of a days-long hunt for two elephants that had escaped from a circus in Hugo, Oklahoma. They were found at Hugo Lake.\\"The Great American Elephant Hunt,\\" vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com, Sports Illustrated, 4 August 1975 Recreation Fishing and hunting are common along the river, as is boating. American Whitewater, a private organization, defines seven miles of the river near Big Cedar as a \\"Class II-III rapid\\". In these upper reaches of the river, kayaking is a popular sport among tourists. In Hugo Lake, boating and camping are popular. Sardis Lake has yet to be tapped for large-scale tourism, but its campgrounds are well used. Some boating and waterskiing takes place on the lake. In 1988 Congress created the Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness. Defined as a territory at and below the headwaters of the Kiamichi River at Pine Mountain and Rich Mountain, the wilderness now encompasses 9,754 acres. It is part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. A portion of the river's watershed is also protected by the Ouachita National Forest.Wilderness.net  Wildlife  Red-cockaded woodpecker Three federally designated endangered species occupy the river valley ‚Äì the Indiana bat, red-cockaded woodpecker and leopard darter. It is also home to a variety of mussels, including several that are somewhat rare. The Kiamichi River has been studied since at least 1894, when the first scientific fish collection was made at Walnut Creek at Albion, Oklahoma. This collection netted 36 different kinds of fish. Since construction of Sardis and Hugo dams in the 1970s and 1980s the river has suffered in environmental quality. Its mussels decrease significantly below the inflow from Sardis dam, and almost extinguished as a species below the inflow from Hugo dam.

Barclays Investment Bank has offices in over 29 countries and since the acquisition of Lehman Brothers' main U.S. division in September 2008, employs over 20,000 people, with over 7,000 people working in the IT division. This has significantly increased Barclays' presence in North America. History Barclays' first investment banking arm was established in 1985 under the name Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW) in response to the Big bang in UK financial services. It was formed through the merger of Barclays Merchant Bank with a UK stockbroker de Zoete & Bevan and one of the London jobbing firms Wedd Durlacher. The equity and Corporate Finance Divisions were sold to Credit Suisse First Boston in 1998 with the remaining businesses dominated by Fixed Income and Structured Capital Markets being retained by Barclays and rebranded Barclays Capital (BarCap). Bob Diamond took charge of Barclays investment banking business in 1996. Diamond led the effort to purchase key assets of Lehman Brothers after its bankruptcy in September 2008, giving Barclays a key and instant foothold in investment banking.

It is the second longest river in Malaysia with a length of from its headwaters in the mountains of southwest Sabah, to its outlet at the Sulu Sea, east of Sandakan. The area is known for its high-biodiversity habitats including its limestone caves at Gomantong hill, dryland dipterocarp forests, riverine forest, freshwater swamp forest, oxbow lakes and salty mangrove swamps near the coast.  Etymology and history  With the early Chinese traders settlement around the river mouth area, the name \\"Kina Bata√±gan\\" has been used by indigenous people with the word \\"Kina\\" itself is a reference by indigenous Dusun for the Chinese people. The Orang Sungai traditionally lived along the river banks and of mixed ancestry including Dusun, Suluk, Bugis, Bajau as well the Chinese. The earliest Chinese traders settlement on the banks of Kinabatangan River has been established since the 7th century where they trade in edible-nest swiftlet, beeswax, rattan and ivory. In the 15th century, a sister of the Chinese Kinabatangan settlement leader married with the Sultan of Brunei. During the era of British North Borneo, the river serves as the route for goods and timber exports, navigable for steam launches as well for smaller boats. William Burgess Pryer did attempt to establish a market at one location called Domingol in the river coast but the plan did not flourish.  Geology and ecology  The river area including Labang and Kuamut are form since the Early and Middle Miocene period while large parts of its river system from the Maliau Basin is form during the Early and Late Miocene. Towards the river mouth, the area is made of Middle Miocene chaotic deposits. The ecology of the upper reaches of the river has been severely disrupted by excessive logging and clearing of land for plantations although the original lowland forests and mangrove swamps near the coast have largely survived, provide sanctuary for a population of saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) and contain some of Borneo's highest concentrations of wildlife. In many villages along the river, the demand for freshwater fish always high where the livehood of the villagers greatly depend on the income from their catches. Each year, the lashing rains of the northeast monsoon cause the river to swell rapidly. Unable to disgorge into the sea quickly enough, the river frequently overflows its banks and spreads across the flat land of its lower reaches, creating a huge floodplain.  Conservation efforts  In 1997, of the lower Kinabatangan floodplain were declared a protected area. Much of the deeper river area are protected under the Lower Kinabatangan Sanctuary, a reserve established in 1999 which provides a variety of habitats for flora especially freshwater swamp forest, mangrove, palms and bamboo as well fauna such as hose's langur, proboscis monkey, orangutan, pig-tailed macaque, gibbon, slow loris, elephant and rhinoceros. In 2001, the lower Kinabatangan floodplain was upgraded into bird sanctuary area through the efforts of non- governmental organisation (NGOs). Following media attention after a decapitated elephant's head was found floating down the river in 2006, the protected area been gazetted as the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary through the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment of 1997 under the purview of the Sabah Wildlife Department in 2009. Since the modern era in the early 1950s until 1987, the lower Kinabatangan area has been subjected to commercial logging activities and more than of its lowland rainforest has been developed into cocoa and palm oil plantations. This resulted in severe pollution to the river which have greatly affected the life of villagers who depended their livelihood on the river and attracting the attention of Minister for Tourism, Culture and Environment Department of the government of Sabah. In 2011, Nestl√© launch a reforestation project of the riparian along the Kinabatangan River in Sukau to create a landscape where people, nature and agriculture activities can co-exist harmoniously in their need for water. Most nature tourism is the Kinabatangan River area is concentrated around Sukau since it is accessible by road and offering comfortable accommodation to visitors prepared to pay for well-managed tours.  Accessibility  The only bridge crossing the river is located at Federal Route , about from Sandakan. A bridge linking Sukau with Litang and Tommanggong was planned but cancelled in April 2017 after opposition from conservationists including David Attenborough due to potential adverse effect on the local pygmy elephant population. The river can be visited all year round, though it is often flooded during the wettest part of the year in December and January. From April to October during the main flowering and fruiting season, the climate is generally fairly dry and a good time to spot many birds and animals. During the northeast monsoon from November to March, there are often heavy showers during the afternoons which usually extended until December and January. Through the rainy season, it is possible to negotiate many of the river channels leading into the oxbow lakes, where there is a greater concentration of wildlife.

As a result, heating equipment in the majority of Alchevsk's buildings was frozen and ruptured, leaving about 60,000 residents with only the protection of individual electric heaters. A few days later the sewage system also froze due to a lack of warm tap water. An investigation revealed the massive, long-time negligence of the city authorities. The whole heating system was designed in a hyper-centralized way, depending on only two boilers and few main pipelines. Moreover, the housing company failed to react to the pipe incident properly: the water from the system wasn't immediately dumped to prevent further freezing. The Ukrainian government took massive emergency actions to protect Alchevsk residents from freezing. Engineering teams sent by cities and industrial companies from other regions of the country were gradually restoring heating appliances in every apartment affected. Hundreds of children together with their schoolteachers were evacuated to the resorts and hotels in the warmer regions of Ukraine. According to the governor of Luhansk Oblast G. Moskal, it has been the worst human-made disaster in the history of independent Ukraine. =War in Donbass (2014-present)= Starting Mid-April 2014 pro-Russian forces conquered several towns in Luhansk Oblast,https://newrepublic.com/article/117387/putin-accidentally-helping- unite-eastern-and-western-ukrainehttp://en.itar-tass.com/world/735082 including Alchevsk.http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/pro-russian-rebels- release-four-of-eight-osce-monitors-held-hostage-in-eastern- ukraine-353655.html In the following war in Donbass, the city became a part of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic.http://www.rferl.org/media/video/ukraine-separatist-funeral- mozgovoi/27040918.html  Economy  The main branches of Alchevsk industry - metallurgical and chemical.

Byzantine Empresses. New York, NY: Alfred A. Knopf, 1963. 257.) was a Byzantine Empress by marriage to Alexios II Komnenos and Andronikos I Komnenos. She was a daughter of Louis VII of France and Ad√®le of Champagne.  Betrothal and marriage  In early 1178, Philip, Count of Flanders visited Constantinople on his way back from the Holy Land. The Eastern Roman Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, who had already entertained Louis VII in Constantinople at Christmas 1147 during the Second Crusade, was perhaps finally convinced by Philip that France would be a desirable ally in Western Europe. Over the winter of 1178-1179 an Imperial embassy accompanying Philip, and led by the Genoese Baldovino Guercio,Bernardo and Salem Maragone, Annales Pisani pp. 68-9 Gentile. was sent to the French court to secure a match between Agnes and Alexios, the only son and heir apparent of Manuel by his second wife Maria of Antioch. This or some similar marriage alliance had been favored by Pope Alexander III as early as 1171.Letter of Alexander III to Archbishop Henry of Reims, 28 February 1171 (Patrologia Latina vol. 200 column 783). It was not uncommon for princesses, when a future marriage had been agreed, to be brought up in their intended husband's family; this, indeed, is why Agnes probably never met her elder sister Alys, who lived in the Kingdom of England from the age of about nine, when her marriage to the future Richard I of England was agreed on (though this marriage never took place). Agnes took ship in Montpellier, bound for Constantinople, at Easter 1179. At Genoa the flotilla increased from 5 to 19 ships, captained by Baldovino Guercio.Annales Pisani; Ottobono, Annales Genuenses, 1179. On arrival in Constantinople in late summer 1179 Agnes was met by seventy high-ranking ladiesGarland. p. 5. and lavish festivities were organized for her. She was greeted with an oration from Eustathios, former Master of the Rhetors and archbishop of Thessalonica.W. Regel, Fontes rerum byzantinicarum (St Petersburg, 1892-1917) p. 84. She was perhaps now presented with an elaborate volume of welcoming verses by an anonymous author, sometimes called the Eisiterion. According to William of Tyre, Agnes was eight on her arrival at Constantinople, while Alexios was thirteen. William got Alexios' age wrong (he was born on 14 September 1169)For references see Alexios II Komnenos. and there is no other source for Agnes' year of birth. If she was in fact eight, she was at least three years too young for marriage, according to most 12th-century views.For example, Irene Doukaina, wife to Alexios I Komnenos and paternal grandmother to Manuel, was twelve years old at her marriage in 1078. Theodora Komnene, niece of Manuel and Queen consort of Baldwin III of Jerusalem, was thirteen years old at her marriage in 1158. Margaret of Hungary would marry Isaac II Angelos in 1185 when she was approximately ten years old, but this was an exceptional case, Isaac in 1185 being far from secure in his hold on power and having an urgent need for dynastic support. However, William of Tyre, who was present at the ceremony, seems to describe it as a full wedding (matrimonii legibus ... copulare); in this he is followed by some other non-Byzantine sources and by many modern authors.William of Tyre, Historia Transmarina 22.4; Roger of Howden, Chronicle, year 1180. The ceremony took place in the Trullo Hall, in the Great Palace, on 2 March 1180. Agnes was officially renamed Anna. Eustathios of Thessalonica produced a speech to celebrate the occasion, whose title in the manuscript is Oration on the Public Celebrations of the Betrothal of the Two Royal Children.Madrid MS Esc. Gr. 265 [Y.II.10] fols 368-372 (as described in G. de Andr√©s, Cat√°logo de los c√≥dices griegos de la Real Biblioteca de El Escorial Vol. 2 [Madrid, 1965] pp. 120-131). This ceremony came approximately one month after the wedding of Alexios' half-sister Maria Porphyrogenita to Renier of Montferrat, conducted by the Patriarch of Constantinople, Theodosios. Empress On 24 September 1180, Manuel died and Alexios succeeded him as Emperor. He was too young to rule unaided; his mother, Maria of Antioch, exercised more influence in affairs of state than Alexios or Anna. In 1183 Maria of Antioch was displaced by a new power behind the throne, Andronikos I Komnenos. Andronikos was a first cousin of Manuel and was known to have harbored imperial ambitions for himself. He is believed to have arranged the deaths by poisoning of Maria Porphyrogenita and her husband Renier; he certainly imprisoned, and soon afterwards executed, Maria of Antioch.For details, with references to sources, see Maria of Antioch. Andronikos was crowned co-ruler with Alexios; then, in October of the same year, he had Alexios strangled. Anna was now 12, and the approximately 65-year-old Andronikos married her. Andronikos had previously been married (his first wife's name is unknown). He had had sexual relationships with two nieces (Eudokia Komnene and Theodora Komnene) and with Philippa of Antioch. Philippa was a daughter of Constance of Antioch and her first husband and consort Raymond of Poitiers; she was also a sister of Maria of Antioch and thus maternal aunt of Alexios. Andronikos had two sons by his first wife; he also had a young son and daughter from his affair with Theodora. His eldest son, Manuel already had a son of his own, the future Alexios I of Trebizond. Anna was Empress consort for two years, until the deposition of Andronikos in September 1185. In an attempt to escape the popular uprising that ended his rule, Andronikos fled from Constantinople with Anna and his mistress (known only as Maraptike). They reached Chele, a fortress on the Bithynian coast of the Black Sea, where they tried to take ship for the Crimea. Their ship was prevented from sailing by contrary winds. Andronikos was eventually captured and returned to the capital,Niketas Choniates, Histories p. 347 van Dieten. where he was tortured and killed on 12 September 1185.  Later life  Anna survived Andronikos' fall and is next heard of in 1193, when she is said by a Western chronicler to have become the lover of Theodore Branas,Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Chronicle 1193. a military leader who fought on the Empire's northern frontier. They did not at first marry. After the fall of Constantinople in 1204, Agnes derived respect from the Latin barons due to her being a former empress. According to Robert of Clari, Agnes had a bad reputation and could only talk through a translator because she did not know French. At that time she was 30 years old and had spent most of her life in the Byzantine court. Anna and Theodore eventually married, at the urging of the Latin emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople, in summer 1204.Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Chronicle 1204. According to the Crusade memoir of Robert of Clari they were already married; however, Alberic's information appears more soundly based. Theodore Branas continued to fight for the Latin Empire, and is last heard of in 1219, by which time Agnes has already disappeared from the historical record. They had at least one daughter, who married Narjot de Toucy.Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Chronicle 1205 and 1235. Her date of death is sometimes given in modern genealogies as \\"1220\\" or \\"after 1240\\".  Cultural references  The crusader Robert of Clari, writing only 25 years after the event, is clear about the rich entourage that accompanied Agnes to Constantinople: :then the king arrayed his sister very richly and sent her with the messengers to Constantinople, and many of his people with her ... When they were come, the emperor did very great honor to the damsel and made great rejoicing over her and her people ... In that account the embassy is attributed to Agnes' brother, Philip II of France, but in fact it was sent by her father, Louis VII. Agnes is the subject of the historical novel Agnes of France (1980) by Greek writer Kostas Kyriazis (b. 1920). The novel describes the events of the reigns of Manuel, Alexios and Andronikos through her eyes. She is also part of the cast of the sequels Fourth Crusade (1981) and Henry of Hainaut (1984).
