As of the 2010 census, the city population was 7,289.

Issues 2. Nebraska State Legislature. p. 7. Nebraska City is home of Arbor Day, the Missouri River Basin Lewis and Clark Center (which focuses on the natural history achievements of the expedition), and the Mayhew Cabin, the only site in the state recognized by the National Park Service as a station on the Underground Railroad. History Early European-American official exploration was reported in 1804 by Lewis and Clark as they journeyed west along the Missouri River. They encountered many of the historic Native American tribes whose ancestors had inhabited the territory for thousands of years. During the years of early pioneer settlement, in 1846 the US Army built Old Fort Kearny at Nebraska City. Several years later, the army abandoned it to relocate the fort to central Nebraska, now south of present-day Kearney. Shortly after the post was vacated, John Boulware developed an important river-crossing and ferry service from Iowa to present-day Nebraska City. He and his father expanded their business and in 1852 or 1853 built a ferry house, the first residence in Nebraska City. In 1854 the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act allowed legal settlement in the regional area. Three townships were incorporated by settlers including Stephen Nuckolls, one of the fathers of Nebraska City. Nebraska City and Kearney City were incorporated in 1855, and South Nebraska City was incorporated in 1856. During those years, Nebraska City competed fiercely to become the Nebraska Territory capital. On December 31, 1857, these three town sites along with Prairie City joined, incorporating as present-day Nebraska City. Before the American Civil War, Nebraska City was noted as having the Territory's largest population of slaves. Many worked on the riverfront as laborers, involved with moving freight and luggage associated with steamboat traffic. J. Sterling Morton, ca. 1858 By the mid-19th century, steamboats on the Missouri River were the vitalizing force behind Nebraska City's growth, bringing commerce, people and freight to the west. In the spring of 1858 Russell, Majors and Waddell started freighting from Nebraska City on a government contract to transport all provisions for all western forts. The supplies were brought up the Missouri River by steamboat and then taken out by wagon train. Nebraska City's favorable position (with a gradual slope from the river to the table land above) and good trail made it an important link to the west. Since that beginning, the city became established as a regional transportation, economic, and agriculture hub for the three state area. Additional forms of transportation were important, including the steam wagon and the first locomotive engine of the Midland Pacific. J. Sterling Morton came to Nebraska City in 1855 to edit the Nebraska City News. Originally from Michigan, he and his wife Caroline were lovers of nature. Morton served as Secretary of Agriculture under President Grover Cleveland‚Äôs administration and in 1872 he was instrumental in establishing the annual tree planting day, Arbor Day. Governor Robert Furnas of Nebraska issued the first Arbor Day Proclamation on March 31, 1874. The holiday is celebrated around the world. Nebraska City has its own hospital, St Marys Hospital.

The entry of the United States into World War I was followed by anti-German sentiment, which extended to a town that bore the name of Germany's capital. A 1918 series of fires that destroyed a block of the town's main street was attributed to anti-German crusaders. In October 1918, less than a month before the war's end, the town's name was changed to its current Otoe. Berlin Precinct was left unchanged, however.

The population was 5,495 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Phelps County. The Nebraska Prairie Museum is located in Holdrege. History Holdrege was established in 1883 when the railroad was extended to that point. It was named for George W. Holdrege, a railroad official. Holdrege was designated county seat in 1884. Holdrege was settled primarily by immigrants from Sweden in the 1880s and was named after George W. Holdrege, general manager of the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad Company. He constructed most of the line‚Äôs mileage in Nebraska, including a section through this small settlement in Phelps County. On December 10, 1883, the first train arrived in Holdrege, a little pioneer town inhabited by 200 people. In 1884, a campaign was started to move the county seat from Phelps Center to Holdrege, and an election was scheduled for October. By that time, the town had acquired a block of ground on which to erect a courthouse. With calm assurance of victory at the polls, Holdrege laid the cornerstone of the building intended to be the Phelps County Courthouse. At the special election, Holdrege received a majority of the votes but the legality of the election was questioned. So citizens of Holdrege went to Phelps Center, picked up the official records and books and hid them for two months pending the arrival of new county officials who would take over on January 1, 1885. Holdrege succeeded in becoming the county seat and the courthouse was completed. Holdrege was incorporated on February 14, 1884 and quickly became the metropolis of the county, being well located with good roads from all directions. The early history of the town was one of ups and downs‚Äîgood crops one year then drought and no crops at all for several years. In 1910, C. W. McConaughy, a Holdrege grain dealer, began crusading for use of the Platte River to supplement subsoil moisture for farmlands in the area. His dream became reality when Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District began its power production and irrigation operations and water flowed into Phelps County for irrigation in 1941. A large increase in the population of Holdrege in the immediate post-war years was due mostly to irrigation. With irrigation came both stable and increased crop production, which brought a pipeline company, grain elevators, and agriculture-related businesses to town.

He was a member of the patrician Basel Merian family. Biography =Early life and marriage= Born in Basel, Merian learned the art of copperplate engraving in Z√ºrich. He next worked and studied in Strasbourg, Nancy, and Paris, before returning to Basel in 1615. The following year he moved to Oppenheim, Germany where he worked for the publisher Johann Theodor de Bry, who was the son of renowned engraver and traveler Theodor de Bry. In 1617, Merian married Maria Magdalena de Bry, daughter of the publisher, and was for a time associated with the de Bry publishing house. In 1620, when Oppenheim was destroyed by fire during the Spanish occupation, they moved back to Basel, but three years later returned to Germany, this time to Frankfurt. They had four daughters and three sons, including Matth√§us Merian the Younger. Maria Magdalena de Bry died in 1645 and the following year Matth√§us married Johanna Catharina Hein. Five years later, Matth√§us died, leaving his wife with two small children, Anna Maria Sibylla Merian (born 1647), who later became a pioneering naturalist and illustrator, and a son, Maximilian, who died before his third birthday. =Later career= In 1623 Merian took over the publishing house of his father-in-law after de Bry's death. In 1626 he became a citizen of Frankfurt and could henceforth work as an independent publisher. He spent most of his working life in Frankfurt. Early in his life, he had created detailed town plans in his unique style, e.g. a plan of Basel (1615) and a plan of Paris (1615). With Martin Zeiler (1589‚Äì1661), a German geographer, and later (circa 1640) with his own son, Matth√§us Merian (der J√ºngere, i.e. \\"the Younger\\" or \\"Jr.\\") (1621‚Äì1687), he produced a series of Topographia. The 21-volume set was collectively known as the Topographia Germaniae. It includes numerous town plans and views, as well as maps of most countries and a World Map‚Äîit was such a popular work that it was re-issued in many editions. He also took over and completed the later parts and editions of the Grand Voyages and Petits Voyages, originally started by de Bry in 1590. Merian's work inspired the Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna by Erik Dahlberg. The German travel magazine Merian is named after him. He was also noted for the finesse of his alchemical illustrations, in books such as the Musaeum Hermeticum (1678) and Atalanta Fugiens (1618). Matth√§us Merian died after several years of illness in 1650 in Langenschwalbach, near Wiesbaden. After his death, his sons Matth√§us Jr. and Caspar took over the publishing house. They continued publishing the Topographia Germaniae and the Theatrum Europaeum under the name Merian Erben (i.e. Merian Heirs).

(1969). The Great Platte River Road. Nebraska State Historical Society. p 6. For travellers following the north bank of the Platte, the Loup River, with its soft banks and quicksands, represented a major obstacle. In the absence of a ferry or a bridge, most of these followed the Loup for a considerable distance upstream before attempting a crossing: the first major wave of Mormon emigrants, for instance, continued up that river to a point about three miles downstream from present-day Fullerton.Mattes (1969), p. 132. =Settlement and early history= Columbus, seen from an airplane, looking south The site of Columbus was settled by the Columbus Town Company on May 28, 1856. The group took its name from Columbus, Ohio, where most of the settlers had originally lived. The townsite was selected for its location on the proposed route of the transcontinental railroad.Evans, Marion Reeder (1936). \\"80 Years of Progress\\". Columbus 1856-1936. The Art Printery. Just west of the Columbus site, the Elk Horn and Loup Fork Bridge and Ferry Company, headed by James C. Mitchell, had laid out the townsite of Pawnee. In 1855, Mitchell had obtained from the First Nebraska Territorial Legislature the right to operate a ferry across the Loup River. The two companies consolidated in November 1856. At the time of its initial settling, the land Columbus occupied still belonged to the Pawnee. However, in 1857, the Pawnee signed a treaty whereunder they gave up the bulk of their Nebraska lands, save for a reservation on what is now Nance County, Nebraska.Hyde, George E. (1951). Pawnee Indians. University of Denver Press. p. 183. In 1858, the Platte County Commissioners passed an act of incorporation making Columbus a town;Platte County, Part 2. Andreas' History of the State of Nebraska. Retrieved 2009-12-13. at this time there were 16 citizens. It became the county seat shortly thereafter. In that same year, at the recommendation of the U.S. Army, a ferry across the Loup was installed; contemporary documents suggest that the Mitchell company had failed to act on its right to operate such a ferry. =Railroads and growth= Growth of the town was slow until 1863. In that year, construction began in Omaha on the transcontinental railroad. The Homestead Act, passed the previous year, attracted a host of settlers to the Plains and gave rise to increased emigrant traffic business. The ferry across the Loup was replaced by a seasonal pontoon bridge, used in the summer and taken up in the winter. The railroad reached Columbus in June 1866, when the city's population was about 75. Union Pacific depot in Columbus The energetic and eccentric promoter George Francis Train envisioned building \\"a magnificent highway of cities\\" from coast to coast along the Union Pacific route; Columbus was to be one of these.Larsen, L. H., B. J. Cottrell, H. A. Dalstrom, and K.C. Dalstrom. (2007) Upstream Metropolis: An Urban Biography of Omaha and Council Bluffs. University of Nebraska Press. p 62. In 1865, he bought several hundred lots in the city. In the following year, seeing the nearby townsite of Cleveland as a threat to his plans for Columbus, he bought the only building on the site, a hotel, and moved it to Columbus. He renamed the building the Credit Foncier Hotel, after his land company, Credit Foncier of America;Curry, Margaret. History of Platte County. Culver City, California: Murry & Gee, Inc., 1950. in it, he set aside a room permanently reserved for the President of the United States. Train believed that the capital of the United States should be in the geographic center of the nation, and promoted Columbus as \\"...the new center of the Union and quite probably the future capital of the U.S.A.\\"Howard, R. W. (1962) The Great Iron Trail: The Story of the First Transcontinental Railroad. Putnam. p. 206. Columbus grew and prospered during the 1870s, as a result of both expanding agriculture in Platte County and traffic on the railroad. During the decade, the population of the county grew threefold, and Columbus became the trade center for an eight-county area. The Black Hills Gold Rush in 1875 led the city's merchants to promote it as a staging and outfitting area for gold seekers, who could ride the railroad to Columbus and then travel overland to the gold fields. In 1879, Columbus became the focus of a war between railroad companies. The Burlington and Missouri proposed to develop a line from Lincoln through Columbus and into northwestern Nebraska, and urged the citizens of Platte County to vote a bond of $100,000 for construction expenses. Union Pacific financier Jay Gould, displeased at the prospect of competition, informed the voters of the county that if the measure passed, he would do his best to ruin Columbus. After a heated campaign, the measure passed despite Gould's threats. The Burlington and Missouri built a line from Lincoln to Columbus, but stopped there; for their diagonal route across Nebraska, they chose one that crossed the Union Pacific at Grand Island rather than Columbus. Gould sought to make good on his threat. When the Union Pacific developed its subsidiary Omaha, Niobrara and Black Hills Railroad, he directed that it cross the Loup River at Lost Creek, then run south to join the Union Pacific's main line at Jackson (since renamed Duncan), bypassing Columbus. Fortunately for Columbus, an ice jam destroyed the Lost Creek bridge in the spring of 1881. Railroad officials agreed to reroute the line down the north bank of the Loup to Columbus in exchange for a $25,000 contribution from the city. =Automobile age= Lincoln Highway Garage, built in downtown Columbus in 1915 In 1911, the Meridian Highway project was launched with the formation of a Meridian Road association in Kansas. Later that same year, John Nicholson, originator of the highway, spoke at a meeting in Columbus, at which the Nebraska Meridian Road Association was organized. The proposed north-south transcontinental highway crossed the Platte and the Loup rivers at the Columbus bridges. In 1922, it was designated a state highway. The completion of the Meridian Bridge in 1924, replacing a seasonal ferry across the Missouri River at the Nebraska-South Dakota border, made the highway a year-round route from Canada to Mexico. In 1928, the route became U.S. Highway 81.Slattery, Christina, Chad D. Moffett, and L. Robert Puschendorf (2001). National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Meridian Highway. Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 2010-04-14. In 1913, the Lincoln Highway was established as an east-west transcontinental highway.

Hotels were expanded and new ones built; service garages were opened. To make the route through Columbus more attractive to motorists, the city undertook to illuminate and pave the downtown streets. By 1925, all of the city's major commercial thoroughfares were paved, and almost every lot along 13th Street (the Lincoln Highway) between 23rd and 29th Avenues was occupied by a commercial building.Kooiman, Barbara M. and Elizabeth A. Butterfield (1996). National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Columbus Commercial Historic District. Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 2010-04-14. Rural Platte County suffered badly from the Great Depression. Grain and livestock prices had been high during World War I, engendering a bubble in farmland; to acquire additional acres, farmers had secured them with mortgages not only on the newly purchased land, but also on their older holdings. The fall in the prices of agricultural commodities, combined with drought-induced crop failures in 1934 and 1936, forced many such farmers to abandon their lands.Olson, Ralph Eugene (1937). Water Power Development on the Lower Loup River: A Study in Economic Geography. Master's thesis, Department of Geography, University of Nebraska at Lincoln. Retrieved 2010-04-14. The civic and commercial leaders of Columbus aggressively sought federal and state funds for local construction projects during this time. In 1931, the Meridian Viaduct was completed, carrying the combined Meridian and Lincoln highways across the Union Pacific tracks and eliminating a grade-level crossing. In 1930‚Äì31, the aging and inadequate bridge across the Platte was replaced; in 1932‚Äì33, a new bridge was built at the Loup crossing. =Hydro power= The most expensive and ambitious of Columbus's Depression-era public-works efforts was the construction of the Loup Project. This was a canal running from a diversion weir on the Loup River in Nance County to the Platte River about below the mouth of the Loup.Firth, Robert E. (1962). Public Power in Nebraska.

At its peak, in October 1936, the project directly employed 1,352 people. To make payments on the Loup Project bonds, the Loup River Public Power District had to find a market for its electricity. Rural electrification was not expanding rapidly, and private power companies in Nebraska were only willing to buy a small fraction of the project's power. Although the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 gave East Coast holding companies an incentive to sell off their Nebraska subsidiaries, bankers were unwilling to finance their sale to the Loup District because of its debts from the canal project. In 1939, Consumers Public Power District was formed in Columbus. The new organization's purpose was to buy power from the Loup Project and from the Tri-County and Sutherland projects on the Platte in central Nebraska, and to market it to consumers and municipal utilities. To this end, it was authorized to issue revenue bonds for the purchase of privately held power companies. By 1942, it had purchased all of the private electrical utilities in Nebraska outside of the immediate vicinity of Omaha; by 1949, the last of the private utilities had been bought up, making Nebraska the only state in the nation to be served entirely by public power.\\"The Tri-County Project: Public Power in Nebraska\\".

Davis is credited with naming the settlement after a city of the same name in Iowa, which had been named after Chief Osceola of the Seminole people. After three years of settlement and disputes over the permanent location, the town itself was organized by frontiersmen William Francis Kimmel and John Hopwood Mickey in the early fall of 1871. It had been decided in an election by a margin of 14 votes, prior to the formation that the \\"geographic center of the county\\" was best suited to be the settlement's site. A courthouse was erected the following spring and a general store was founded in May. During the summer, a post office was built, which served as a terminus between the cities of Lincoln and Ulysses. The town's first full year concluded with the establishment of a public school. The following year brought Methodism to the town, and a church for the faith had been completed by 1878. In the succeeding year, Nebraska Wesleyan college was founded in the church, serving 11 students by means of 4 instructors. The school would later move to Fullerton.

In 1879, with the coming of the railroad, a second post office named Arcade was established one mile east of the present site of Shelby. In the winter of 1880, the post office was moved again a mile west to where Shelby is today. Postal authorities objected to the name \\"Arcade\\" due to confusion with the town of Arcadia in Loup County. In search of a new name for the settlement, the people chose \\"Shelby\\", after the name of an official with the Omaha and Republican Valley Railway (a branch of the Union Pacific). The land which Arcade was established on was owned by Gilbert Van Vorce and Peter Matter. Seeing a need for a trade center in the area, these men gave the railroad company half interest in their property and the town was established. After the railroad retained its on each side and closest to the tracks, eight blocks were located on each side parallel to the tracks. The original streets are still present and retain the names of Walnut, Elm, Chestnut, Pine, Cherry, and Oak.

The population was 1,171 at the 2010 census.  History  Stromsburg was settled early in Nebraska history. A group of Swedish settlers coming from the town of Ockelbo arrived in the 1860s after several years in Illinois. This group had a leader named Lewis Headstrom, who was a real estate agent. Seeing some similarities to their old Swedish homeland the settlers formed what would be called Stromsburg, named after a section of Ockelbo, Sweden. By the 1880s two brickyards were in operation in the town. Many buildings from ‚Äònative‚Äô brick still stand, including the Viking Center, now a community center that was originally The Opera House; the Cornerstone Bank; two businesses on the east side of the square; and several homes. Brick streets still surround the city square in Stromsburg. A brick Carnegie library was built in Stromsburg in 1918. The downtown area of Stromsburg has a town square in its center. This square forms a park, with lawns and mature trees, where festivals and events are held. In the center of the square is a two-story Swedish style building made of brick with decorative toll painting and the phrase \\"V√§lkommen\\" (Swedish for \\"Welcome\\"). Stromsburg was given the title of the ‚ÄúSwede Capital of Nebraska‚Äù by Governor Frank B. Morrison in 1966 at the Swedish Festival. The Swedish festival is held in June each year and showcases Stromburg's Swedish heritage. Stromsburg Public School was established in 1887. It operated until 2002, when the Stromsburg district consolidated with Benedict, Nebraska to form Cross County Community School. Stromsburg Library Geography Stromsburg is located at (41.115580, -97.593551). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Swedish Festival Every summer, Stromsburg holds its weekend-long Swedish Festival, a celebration of the town's Swedish heritage.

Information within the BNF includes indication(s), contraindications, side effects, doses, legal classification, names and prices of available proprietary and generic formulations, and any other notable points. Though it is a national formulary, it nevertheless also includes entries for some medicines which are not available under the NHS, and must be prescribed and/or purchased privately. A symbol clearly denotes such drugs in their entry. It is used by pharmacists and doctors (both general practitioners (GPs) and specialist practitioners), and by other prescribing healthcare professionals (such as nurses, pharmacy technicians, paramedics, and dentists); as a reference for correct dosage, indication, interactions and side effects of drugs. It is also used as a reassurance by those administering drugs, for example a nurse on a hospital ward, and even for patients and others seeking an authoritative source of advice on any aspect of pharmacotherapy. The British Pharmacopoeia (BP) specifies quality standards for the making of drugs listed in the BNF. Development Many individuals and organisations contribute towards the preparation of the BNF. It is jointly authored by the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS); and is jointly published by the BMJ Group (which is owned by the BMA), and the Pharmaceutical Press (owned by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society). It is published under the authority of a Joint Formulary Committee (JFC), which comprises representatives of the two professional bodies, and the Department of Health (DoH). Information on drugs is drawn from the manufacturers' product literature, medical and pharmaceutical literature, regulatory authorities and professional bodies. Advice is constructed from clinical literature, and reflects, as far as possible, an evaluation of the evidence from diverse sources. The BNF also takes account of authoritative national guidelines and emerging safety concerns. In addition, the Joint Formulary Committee takes advice on all therapeutic areas from expert clinicians; this ensures that the BNF's recommendations are relevant to practice. However, in September 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK opened a consultation on its draft decision not to give NICE accreditation to the processes to produce BNF publications following a review by an independent advisory committee. History It was first published in 1949 as the National Formulary, with updated versions appearing every three years until 1976. The fifth version in 1957 saw its name change to The British National Formulary. A new look version, under the auspices of Owen Wade, was released in 1981. A study in Northern Ireland looking at prescribing in 1965, reported that the BNF was likely able to serve the requirements of prescribers in general practice, while also achieving a cost saving. By 2003, issue 46 of the BNF contained 3000 interactions or groups of interactions, with about 900 of these marked by a bullet. Editions A new edition of the BNF book is published twice-yearly; in March and September. , the current edition is 79, which was published in March 2020. It is a customary tradition that the colour of each new edition is radically different from the previous. Availability The BNF is presently available as a book, a website, and mobile applications - the latter for use on smartphones and tablets. The book is available for purchase, and the September edition is distributed to healthcare professionals in the UK at no direct cost to them. NHS workers and healthcare professionals in the HINARI group of developing nations are entitled to free access via MedicinesComplete following registration (requires provision of a name, an address, an email address, and a phone number). Other visitors can subscribe to the BNF on MedicinesComplete. MedicinesComplete Healthcare organisations can also subscribe to a customisable BNF via their corporate online intranet.http://www.bnfformularycomplete.com BNF on FormularyComplete In June 2012, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) released applications for offline access to the BNF on iOS and Android devices. An NHS Athens log-in is required to use this application, and monthly content updates are available, over an internet connection. NICE also provides a website providing the content of the BNF to the public, including non-NHS users.https://bnf.nice.org.uk/ Sister publications The British National Formulary for Children (BNFC) British National Formulary for Children book, first published September 2005, is published yearly, and details the doses and uses of medicines in children from neonates to adolescents. The Nurse Prescriber's Formulary for Community Practitioners (NPF) is issued in print every two years (September, odd-numbered years), for use by District Nurses and Specialist Community Public Health Nurses (including Health Visitors) who have received training to become nurse prescribers.

The population was 4,325 at the 2010 census, down from 4,671 in 2000. History Falls City was founded in the summer of 1857 by James Lane, John Burbank, J.E. Burbank, and Isaac L. Hamby. The town is located on the north side of the Big Nemaha River, in the southeast corner of the state. The river in 1857 had banks and bed of rock and stone. The town was located near where the river flowed over a four-foot (1.3 m) rock ledge called the \\"Falls of Nemaha\\", for which the town was named. Over time the river has changed to the extent that the falls no longer exist. The town was a stop on the Underground Railroad for escaping slaves during the struggles resulting from the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. Early in the city's history, it won a prolonged process to become the county seat of Richardson County. The county originally selected Salem, Nebraska to be the county seat, but due to Salem's lack of a suitable building site, a new election was held which Falls City tied in the vote. Finally in a third election in 1860, Falls City was declared the permanent site of the county seat. Falls City grew in the late 19th century due to the arrival of the Atchison & Nebraska Railroad in 1871 and the Missouri Pacific in 1882, for which Falls City was designated as a division point in 1909. The population of the city peaked at 6,200 citizens in 1950. In the summer of 1966, Braniff Airlines Flight 250 crashed near Falls City due to bad weather, killing all 42 on board. The BAC One-Eleven aircraft was on the Kansas City to Omaha leg of a multi-stop flight from New Orleans to Minneapolis on Saturday night, August 6. In 1993, Brandon Teena, a trans man who had recently arrived in Falls City, was murdered by two acquaintances who, upon discovering that he had been assigned female at birth, had beaten and raped him about a week previously. Brandon had reported the rape to the police, but the Richardson County sheriff had failed to take steps to protect him; in particular, he had not arrested the two alleged rapists. Learning that the rape had been reported, the two tracked Brandon to a farmhouse near Humboldt, where they killed him and two others. Brandon's mother subsequently sued the sheriff and the county for negligence, wrongful death, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Briefs were filed in the case by thirty-four civil-rights groups, including the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund; the matter eventually came before the Nebraska Supreme Court, which found the county negligent in failing to protect Brandon. The episode was dramatized in a 1999 film titled Boys Don't Cry; actor Hilary Swank received an Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Brandon.

Economy A popular tool, called the Vise-Grip, was first manufactured in De Witt. The Vise-Grip was originally manufactured in De Witt by Petersen Manufacturing, founded by Danish immigrant William Petersen. Petersen, a blacksmith by trade, invented the first locking pliers and began selling them from the trunk of his car to farmers and people in surrounding towns. In 1985 American Tool Companies Inc. was formed by the Petersen family, and it in turn acquired Petersen Manufacturing. In 1993 American Tool acquired Irwin Industrial. The company operated under the Irwin Industrial name beginning in 2002 when it was purchased by Newell Rubbermaid. On October 31, 2008 the plant was closed and 330 jobs were lost when manufacturing of Vise- Grips and other tools moved to China. In 2009 Gerry Durnell writing in Automobile Quarterly said: \\"The original Vise-Grip manufacturing plant now sits vacant. One auction has already taken place, another is contemplated, and the building is for sale.

This (now the senior) branch of the Cavendish family has been one of the wealthiest British aristocratic families since the 16th century and has been rivalled in political influence perhaps only by the Marquesses of Salisbury and the Earls of Derby. History Although modern usage outside of the county itself now rarely refers to Devon as \\"Devonshire\\", the title remained \\"Duke of Devonshire\\". Despite the territorial designation of the dukedom and the subsidiary title of the earldom of Devonshire, the family estates are centred in Derbyshire. The title \\"Duke of Devonshire\\" should not be confused with the ancient title of Earl of Devon. Uniquely, every Duke of Devonshire has so far been appointed a Knight of the Garter, except () the present one. =Cavendish knights, and the 1st Earl of Devonshire= William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire briefly Prime Minister between 1756 and 1757. The Cavendish family descends from Sir John Cavendish, who took his name from the village of Cavendish, Suffolk, where he held an estate in the 14th century. He served as Chief Justice of the King's Bench from 1372 to 1381, and was killed in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. Two of his great-grandsons were George Cavendish, Thomas Cardinal Wolsey's biographer, and George's younger brother Sir William Cavendish. Sir William gained great wealth from his position in the Exchequer and also (allegedly) from unfairly taking advantage of the dissolution of the Monasteries. He married (1547) as his third wife the famous Bess of Hardwick, with whom he had eight children. One of their sons, Sir Charles Cavendish (1553‚Äì1617), was the father of William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1592‚Äì1676; see Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne for more information on this branch of the family), while another son, Henry Cavendish, was the ancestor of the Barons Waterpark. Yet another son, William Cavendish (1552‚Äì1626), was a politician and a supporter of the colonization of Virginia. In 1605 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cavendish, of Hardwicke in the County of Derby, and in 1618 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Devonshire. Both titles are in the Peerage of England. =The 2nd Earl of Devonshire and the first five Dukes of Devonshire= He was succeeded by his eldest son, William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire, who served as Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire and was a patron of the philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679). On his early death in 1628 the titles passed to his son, William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire, who also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He was a strong supporter of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and later served under William III and Mary II as Lord Steward of the Household. In 1694 he was created Marquess of Hartington and Duke of Devonshire in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Duke, who held political office as Lord President of the Council and Lord Privy Seal and was also Lord-Lieutenant of Devonshire. His eldest son, the third Duke, served as Lord Privy Seal, as Lord Steward of the Household and (from 1737 to 1745) as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Duke, who was a prominent politician. He was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Cavendish, of Hardwicke in 1751 and served as First Lord of the Treasury and titular Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1756 to 1757. Devonshire married Charlotte Boyle, 6th Baroness Clifford, daughter of the famous architect Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (on whose death in 1753 the earldom of Burlington became extinct). Their third and youngest son Lord George Cavendish was recreated Earl of Burlington in 1831. Devonshire was succeeded by his eldest son, William Cavendish, who became the fifth Duke of Devonshire. He had already succeeded his mother as seventh Baron Clifford in 1754. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire from 1782 to 1811 but is best rememberedThe Duchess for his first marriage (1774) to Lady Georgiana Spencer (1757-1806), the celebrated beauty and society hostess. =The sixth, seventh and eighth Dukes= Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire Their only son, the sixth Duke, served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household from 1827 to 1828 and from 1830 to 1834. Known as the \\"Bachelor Duke\\", he never married and on his death in 1858 the barony of Clifford fell into abeyance between his sisters. He was succeeded in the other titles by his first cousin once removed, the second Earl of Burlington, who became the seventh Duke (see the Earl of Burlington for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was the son of William Cavendish, eldest son of the aforementioned first Earl of Burlington, youngest son of the fourth Duke. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire and Derbyshire and Chancellor of the University of London and of the University of Cambridge. He was succeeded by his second, but eldest surviving son, the eighth Duke. The eighth Duke was a noted statesman and the most famous member of the Cavendish family. Known under his courtesy title of Marquess of Hartington until 1891, he held political office for a period spanning 40 years, notably as Secretary of State for India and as Secretary of State for War, and three times declined to become Prime Minister. He married Louise, Dowager Duchess of Manchester, who became known as the \\"Double Duchess\\". =The ninth, tenth and eleventh Dukes= Devonshire died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Duke. He was the eldest son of Lord Edward Cavendish, third son of the seventh Duke. He was a Conservative politician and served as Governor-General of Canada from 1916 to 1921 and as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1922 to 1924. His elder son, the tenth Duke, also a Conservative politician, served as Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, as Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma and as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. He married Lady Mary Gascoyne- Cecil, who was Mistress of the Robes to Queen Elizabeth II from 1953 to 1966. Their elder son and heir apparent William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, married Kathleen Kennedy, daughter of Joseph Kennedy and sister of the future President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Lord Hartington was killed in the Second World War in 1944 shortly after the marriage. The couple had no children. Devonshire was therefore succeeded by his second and only surviving son, the eleventh Duke. He sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and held political office (under his uncle Harold Macmillan and later under Sir Alec Douglas-Home) from 1960 to 1964. Devonshire married the Hon. Deborah Mitford, the youngest of the famous Mitford sisters. As of 2009 the titles are held by their second and only surviving son, Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire, who succeeded in 2004. =Other notable members of the Cavendish family= Numerous other members of the Cavendish family have also gained distinction. Lord Henry Cavendish (1673‚Äì1700), second son of the first Duke, was Member of Parliament for Derby. Lord James Cavendish (died 1751), third son of the first Duke, also represented this constituency in the House of Commons. Lord Charles Cavendish (1704‚Äì1783), second son of the second Duke, was a politician and scientist. His son Henry Cavendish (1731‚Äì1810) was an influential scientist noted for his discovery of hydrogen. Lord James Cavendish (1701‚Äì1741), third son of the second Duke, was a soldier and briefly represented Malton in Parliament. Lord George Cavendish (died 1794), second son of the third Duke, was a long-standing Member of Parliament and served as Comptroller of the Household from 1761 to 1762. Lord Frederick Cavendish, third son of the third Duke, was a Field Marshal in the Army. Lord John Cavendish, fourth son of the third Duke, was a politician and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1782 and 1783. Chatsworth House, the ancestral seat of the Dukes of Devonshire Lord Richard Cavendish, second son of the fourth Duke, represented Lancaster and Derbyshire in the House of Commons. Lady Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of the fourth Duke, married Prime Minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (who assumed the additional surname of Cavendish) and was an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth II. Augustus Clifford, illegitimate son by the fifth Duke and his mistress and later second wife Elizabeth Hervey, was a naval commander and was created a baronet in 1838 (see Clifford baronets). William Cavendish, eldest son of the first Earl of Burlington and father of the seventh Duke, represented Aylesbury and Derby in Parliament. George Henry Compton Cavendish, second son of the first Earl of Burlington, was Member of Parliament for Aylesbury. The Hon. Henry Frederick Compton Cavendish, third son of the first Earl of Burlington, was a general in the Army. The Hon. Charles Compton Cavendish, fourth son of the first Earl of Burlington, was created Baron Chesham in 1858. Lord Frederick Cavendish, third son of the seventh Duke, was a Liberal politician. He had just been appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1882 when he was assassinated by nationalists in Phoenix Park, Dublin. His wife Lady Frederick (Lucy) Cavendish was a pioneer of women's education. Lord Edward Cavendish, fourth and youngest son of the seventh Duke, sat as Member of Parliament for several constituencies. His second son Lord Richard Cavendish represented North Lonsdale in Parliament. In 1911 he was one of the proposed recipients of peerages in case the Bill that was to become the Parliament Act 1911 was not accepted by the House of Lords. His grandson Hugh Cavendish was created a life peer as Baron Cavendish of Furness in 1990. Lady Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of the ninth Duke, was the wife of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. =Courtesy titles and family seats= The Duke of Devonshire's eldest son may use the courtesy title Marquess of Hartington, whilst the eldest son of the eldest son may use the title Earl of Burlington, and his eldest son may use the title Lord Cavendish. St Peter's Church, Edensor, Cavendish family plot with the graves of the Dukes of Devonshire The family seats are Chatsworth House, Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire, and Lismore Castle in Co Waterford, in the Republic of Ireland. Compton Place in Eastbourne belongs to the family (which developed Eastbourne as a seaside resort in the 19th century) but is let. In 1908 Holker Hall, then in Lancashire, now in Cumbria, was left to a junior branch of the family. The family previously owned Londesborough Hall, Yorkshire; Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire; Chiswick House, Middlesex; and two London mansions on Piccadilly: Devonshire House and Burlington House. In 1907 the Duke owned 192,322 acres across the British Isles, principally in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, County Cork and County Waterford.H.

It is a separate title from that of Earl of Devon, which still belongs to the Courtenay family. In fiction The fifth Duke and Duchess of Devonshire are portrayed in the 2008 film The Duchess directed by Saul Dibb. The film is based on Amanda Foreman's biography of the scandalous 18th-century English aristocrat Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (portrayed by Keira Knightley) and her relationship with the Duke (Ralph Fiennes) and his next wife, Lady Elizabeth Foster. Along with Jane Austen, the fifth Duke and his second wife appear, soon after Georgiana's death, in Jane and the Stillroom Maid, a murder mystery by Stephanie Barron. In John Buchan's novel The Three Hostages (1924), 'the late Duke of Devonshire' is cited as an epitome of Englishness. This probably refers to the eighth duke.

The population was 4,441 at the 2010 census. History Gretna started shortly after the Burlington Railroad built a short line between Omaha and Ashland in the summer of 1886. Advent of the village of Gretna on this new laid rail line was the cue for the exit of the nearby trading post of Forest City, which had existed since 1856. In its day, Forest City, located 2.5 miles southwest of where Gretna now stands, was a flourishing and busy place, but it was doomed by the rail road which passed it by. The only marker that exists today to show the site of old Forest City is the cemetery (Holy Sepulcher) which is located a little to the east of what was the center of activity in the settlement. Names that were prominent in the beginnings of Forest City were the families of William Langdon, John Thomas and John Conner. The Lincoln Land Company, recognizing the potential of the site, surveyed and platted the town site of Gretna in 1887. The village was incorporated by July 10, 1889. The name suggests Scotland's Gretna Green, the ancestral county of some of the earliest settlers. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

It is the headquarters of the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), the 557th Weather Wing, and the 55th Wing (55 WG) of the Air Combat Command (ACC), the latter serving as the host unit. Aviation use at Offutt began in September 1918 during World War I as an Army Air Service balloon field.World War I Group, Historical Division, Special Staff, United States Army, Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the World War (1917‚Äì1919) Originally named Fort Crook, it was renamed in honor of World War I pilot and Omaha native 1st Lt. Jarvis Offutt in 1924. Offutt AFB's legacy includes the construction of the Enola Gay and Bockscar, the planes that dropped Little Boy and Fat Man over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. Offutt served over 40 years as the headquarters for the former Strategic Air Command (SAC) and home for its associated ground and aerial command centers for the U.S. in case of nuclear war during the Cold War. The population was 8,901 at the 2000 census. History Offutt AFB is named in honor of First Lieutenant Jarvis Jennes Offutt (26 October 1894 ‚Äì 13 August 1918). The first native of Omaha to become a casualty in World War I, Lieutenant Offutt died of injuries sustained when his SE-5 fighter crashed during a training flight near Valheureux, France. The airfield portion of Fort Crook was designated Offutt Field on 10 May 1924. =Fort Crook= Offutt's history began with the commissioning by the War Department in 1890 of Fort Crook. Located some 10 miles south of Omaha and two miles west of the Missouri River, the fort was constructed between 1894 and 1896. The fort's namesake was Major General George Crook, a Civil War veteran and Indian fighter. It was first used as a dispatch point for Indian conflicts on the Great Plains. Troops from Fort Crook fought during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War when the 22nd Regiment under Charles A. Wikoff was dispatched to Cuba. The regiment suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of El Caney. Only 165 of the 513 regiment members survived with most succumbing to tropical diseases after the battle. The oldest surviving portion of Fort Crook is the parade grounds and surrounding red brick buildings that were constructed between 1894 and 1896. These structures are still in active use today as squadron headquarters, living quarters for high-ranking generals (Generals Row), and Nebraska's oldest operational jail. =Offutt Field= left In 1918, the 61st Balloon Company of the Army Air Corps was assigned to Fort Crook at the close of World War I, which performed combat reconnaissance training. In the spring of 1921, the plowing, leveling, and seeding of 260 acres of land at Fort Crook created an airfield suitable for frequent takeoffs and landings and as a refueling stop for mail and transcontinental flights. The first permanent aircraft hangars were completed in 1921. Other known organizations assigned to the field were the 74th Balloon Company in November 1918; 60th Balloon Company in December 1918. On 6 May 1924, the airfield was officially named \\"Offutt Field\\". The field accommodated interim reserve flying training and regular Post Office Department airmail flights during the 1920s and 1930s; a small detachment of enlisted men (detached service) from Marshall Field and Fort Riley, Kansas, constituted the only military presence on the field between 1935 and 1940. =Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant= Offutt in the mid-1940s as a war production plant for the Glenn L. Martin company In 1940 as American involvement in World War II loomed, the Army Air Corps chose Offutt Field as the site for a new bomber plant that was to be operated by the Glenn L. Martin Company. The plant's construction included a two-mile (3 km)-long concrete runway, six large hangars, and a aircraft-assembly building. Production switched to B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombers in 1944, and 531 Superfortresses were produced before the end of World War II. Among these were the Enola Gay and Bockscar, the B-29's that dropped the first atomic weapons to be used in a military action (against the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan). Production ended on 18 September 1945, when the last B-29 rolled out of the assembly building. With the manufacturing plant's closure, custody of the airfield and ground facilities were assumed by the 4131st Army Air Force Base Unit, Air Materiel Command. =Postwar use= left In the initial months after the end of World War II, Offutt was used by the 2474th Separation Processing squadron to demobilize service members out of the armed forces after their return from overseas duty. In June 1946, the Army Air Force re- designated Fort Crook and the Martin-Nebraska facilities as Offutt Field. It became the headquarters for the Air Defense Command Second Air Force on 6 June. In 1947, the airfield opened for operational use, with the 381st Bombardment Group being assigned to the field with one squadron of B-29 Superfortresses, although the facility remained primarily a separation center. The newly established United States Air Force took control of the facility in September 1947, and on 13 January 1948, it was renamed Offutt Air Force Base. Later that same year, on 26 September, the 3902nd Air Base Group (later Wing) became the host unit at Offutt. =Strategic Air Command= Strategic Air Command insignia At one minute past midnight, on 9 November 1948, Offutt gained international prominence when it became the host base for Headquarters Strategic Air Command, which was moved from Andrews AFB, Maryland. Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington chose to locate the Air Force's crucial long-range atomic strike force at Offutt primarily because the base was centrally located on the North American continent, placing it well beyond the existing range of long-range, nuclear-armed bombers to (then) stay safely out of range of hostile missiles or bomber aircraft. Offutt's population and facilities grew dramatically to keep pace with the increased operational demands during the Cold War. Several new dormitories and more than 2,000 family housing units ‚Äì built in the late 1950s and 1960s under incremental Wherry and Capehart projects ‚Äì quickly replaced the old quarters of Fort Crook. Headquarters SAC moved from the Martin-Nebraska complex to Building 500 in 1957, and new base facilities in the 1960s and 1970s included a hospital, main exchange, commissary, and library. During the late 1950s, Offutt housed a Royal Air Force facility for servicing Avro Vulcans, which visited the air base frequently while on exercise with SAC. Operational use of Offutt Air Force Base included the basing of alert tankers in the late 1950s and 1960s, support for intercontinental ballistic missile sites in Nebraska and Iowa in the 1960s, and worldwide reconnaissance from the mid-1960s to the present. To provide air defense of the base, the United States Army established the Offutt AFB Defense Area, and Nike-Hercules Surface-to-air missile sites were constructed during 1959. Sites were located near Cedar Creek, Nebraska (OF-60) , and Council Bluffs, Iowa (OF-10) . They were operational between November 1960 and March 1966. The missiles were operated by the 6th Battalion, 43d Artillery.Lincoln Air Force Base Online Museum During the Cold War, a general and various support personnel from the base were airborne 24-hours a day on an EC-135 from 3 February 1961 to 24 July 1990 in Operation Looking Glass, creating an airborne command post in case of war. Operation Looking Glass carried out its mission without any mishaps or incidents during its 29 years of existence. The 3902d Air Base Wing was inactivated on 1 March 1986, and the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing assumed host-unit responsibilities for Offutt. Increased defense spending during the 1980s brought additional operational improvements to Offutt, including the Bennie Davis Aircraft Maintenance Hangar, and a new command center for Headquarters SAC. =U.S. Strategic Command= Gen. Curtis E. LeMay Building, U.S. Strategic Command HeadquartersOffutt again faced monumental changes in 1992 when the easing of world tensions allowed the United States to reorganize the Air Force. The Strategic Air Command (SAC) was inactivated on 1 June, succeeded by the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), a Unified Combatant Command of the Department of Defense. The 55th Strategic Wing then became the 55th Wing, under the newly created Air Combat Command. In 1998, the Strategic Air and Space Museum moved 30 miles (48 km) southwest to Ashland, just off Interstate 80, midway between Omaha and Lincoln. In 2005, Offutt began several major renovations. The on-base Wherry housing area was demolished for replacement with new housing. A new fire house, AAFES mini-mall, and U.S. Post Office were completed in 2006. Additionally, the Air Force Weather Agency broke ground on a new facility which was completed in 2008. The new headquarters for STRATCOM, the Command and Control Facility (C2F), is expected to be operational in September 2018. The base sustained significant damage in the spring of 2019 as a result of the Missouri River flooding; at one point, almost half of the base's runway was underwater. Flight operations and some support staff were temporarily relocated to nearby Lincoln Air National Guard Base while repairs (as well as some pre-planned construction projects) were undertaken. =President Bush Offutt Conference on 11 September 2001= On 11 September 2001, President George W. Bush conducted one of the first major strategy sessions for the response to the September 11 attacks from a bunker at the base. Bush, who was in Florida at the Emma Booker Elementary School in Sarasota at the time of the attacks, first flew from Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana and then to Offutt en route back to Washington, DC. Bush arrived at 2:50 pm (Eastern), conducted a video conference in an underground command bunker and left for Washington, DC at 4:30 pm.left Air Force One left Barksdale AFB for Offutt AFB around 1:30 pm. Air Force One entourage was pared down to a few essential staffers such as Ari Fleischer, Andrew Card, Karl Rove, Dan Bartlett, Brian Montgomery, and Gordon Johndroe, plus about five reporters. During the flight, Bush remained in \\"continuous contact\\" with both the White House Situation Room and Vice- President Dick Cheney in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. Air Force One landed at Offutt shortly before 3:00 pm. At 3:06, Bush passed through security to the US Strategic Command Underground Command Center () and was taken into an underground bunker designed to withstand a nuclear blast. There, he held a teleconference call with Vice-President Cheney, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, CIA Director George Tenet, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, and others. The meeting lasted about an hour. Rice recalled that during the meeting, Tenet told Bush, \\"Sir, I believe it's al- Qaeda. We're doing the assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al-Qaeda.\\" The White House staff was preparing for Bush to address the nation from the Offutt bunker, but Bush decided instead to return to Washington. Air Force One left Offutt around 4:30 pm. =Whistleblower suit= In May 2011, base civilian employee George Sarris successfully settled with the government over claims that he was subjected to retaliation for talking to the media in 2008 about poor maintenance of RC-135 aircraft at the base. After Sarris' allegations appeared in the Kansas City Star, base officials revoked his security clearance and reassigned him to menial duties. Later investigations by the government substantiated many of Sarris' claims. As part of the settlement, the USAF agreed to pay Sarris his full salary until he retired in 2014 and paid $21,000 of his attorney's fees. After retiring, Sarris published a book titled, Cowardice in Leadership ‚Äì A Lesson in Harassment, Intimidation, and Reprisals. Ten years after blowing the whistle, the Omaha World Herald published a three-part series, \\"In-flight emergency\\" which confirmed Sarris' earlier claims. =Previous names= * Fort Crook, 3 March 1891 * Offutt Flying Field, Fort Crook, 1920 * Offutt Field, 6 May 1924 Space Shuttle Atlantis being shuttled through Offutt following a mission on 1 July 2007 = Major commands to which assigned = * Seventh Corps Area, United States Army, 1920 * Army Air Forces Materiel Command, 13 October 1942 * Army Air Forces Materiel and Services Command, 17 lui 1944 : Redesignated: AAF Technical Service Comd, 31 August 1944 : Redesignated: Air Technical Service Command, 1 lui 1945 : Redesignated: Air Materiel Command, 9 March 1946 : : The United States Army Seventh Service Command exercised overall jurisdiction until 11 June 1946 * Air Defense Command, 11 June 1946 * Strategic Air Command, 1 October 1948 * Air Combat Command, 1 June 1992 =Major units assigned= * Second Air Force, 6 June 1946 ‚Äì 1 July 1948 * 381st Bombardment Group, 24 July 1947 ‚Äì 27 June 1949 * Tenth Air Force, 1 July ‚Äì 24 August 1948 * 3902d Air Base Group (later Wing), 26 September 1948 ‚Äì 1 March 1986 * Strategic Air Command, 8 November 1948 ‚Äì 1 June 1992 * 438th Troop Carrier Wing, 27 June 1949 ‚Äì 14 March 1951 * 5th Air Division, 14 January ‚Äì 25 May 1951 * 1st Weather Group, 20 April 1952 ‚Äì 8 October 1956 * 544th Strategic Intelligence Wing, 12 April 1952 ‚Äì 1 June 1992 * 3d Weather Wing, 8 October 1956 ‚Äì 1 June 1992 * 34th Air Refueling Squadron, 1 October 1958 ‚Äì 25 June 1966 * 4321st Strategic Wing, 1 October 1959 ‚Äì 1 January 1963 * 549th Strategic Missile Squadron, 1 July 1961 ‚Äì 15 December 1964 * 385th Strategic Aerospace Wing, 1 January 1963 ‚Äì 15 December 1964 * 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (and subsequent redesignations), 16 August 1966 ‚Äì present * Air Force Global Weather Center (and subsequent redesignations), 8 July 1969 ‚Äì present * 1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron (and subsequent redesignations), 1 July 1977 ‚Äì present * United States Strategic Command, 1 June 1992 ‚Äì present * 55th Electronic Combat Group, 1 April 1992 ‚Äì present * General Curtis Lemay Offutt Composite Squadron Civil Air Patrol * 595th Command and Control Group * 1st Air COMM Group, then 1st Air Comm Wing, then 1st Air Information Systems Wing at least August 1984 ‚Äì April 1988.

The construction project was completed on 28 July 1960. In April and May 1961, the three complexes became the last Atlas D missiles to go on alert. The missiles were manned by the 549th Strategic Missile Squadron which was activated on 1 October 1960. The squadron began to phase down with the inactivation of the Atlas-D on 1 October 1964, and was inactivated 14 December 1964. Confusingly, the squadron was originally the 566th but on 1 July 1961 SAC swapped designators with the 549th at F.E. Warren AFB. The 549th SMS was under the 385th Strategic Aerospace Wing. Site \\"A\\" was abandoned for many years, until the late 1970s when the Nebraska National Guard took over ownership of the site to establish a training area called the Mead Training Site. The site is managed by the Camp Ashland Training Site Command. The training area has been used by the National Guard, United States Air Force, local law enforcement, and other entities as a training site for many years. 3/209th RTI out of Camp Ashland began using Mead Training Site in 2008 as the primary training facility for their 88M military occupational specialty reclassification school and continues to use the site year round. A MOUT site (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) was constructed at the site in 2009. Two Nebraska National Guard armories were built directly alongside the training area in 2012. Many other National Guard units use the site for drill weekends and annual trainings. Airmen out of Offutt Air Force Base practice Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) Training at the site several weekends a year. Site \\"B\\" is in use for agricultural storage.

Offutt in popular culture Offutt was brought to popular attention during its SAC period when the command was depicted in the 1955 film Strategic Air Command starring Jimmy Stewart, the 1963 film A Gathering of Eagles starring Rock Hudson, and 1964's Fail-Safe starring Henry Fonda (which not only claimed to show portions of the base but also a nearby Omaha neighborhood) and Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb starring Peter Sellers (which depicts a nuclear first strike from a mad general at the fictional Burpelson Air Force Base). Offutt appeared in the Star Trek episode \\"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\\" (identified as 'the Omaha installation'), when a fighter pilot stationed there detects the approaching USS Enterprise and is transported aboard. The Dale Brown novel Plan of Attack saw nuclear missiles launched by Russian bombers attacking multiple bomber bases all over the U.S, including Offutt, which is destroyed by four Kh-15 (AS-17 Kickback) missiles. Only one Boeing E-4 NEACP escapes in time, and the officials of the Eighth Air Force and STRATCOM are eliminated in the process. Pat Frank's iconic Cold War novel Alas, Babylon (1959) has Air Force Colonel Mark Bragg, the brother of the protagonist Randy Bragg, stationed at Offutt. In the 1983 post apocalyptic feature film for television, \\"The Day After\\", Offutt is represented as a SAC Aircraft departs the field as the cameras then change focus to the countryside as the credits roll.

Designated as the county seat, it developed as an 1870s railroad town and suburb of Omaha. The city is part of the larger five-county metro area of Omaha. Papillion's population was 18,894 at the 2010 census. Its growth since the late 20th century has reflected Omaha's. Overview The city was named after the creek of the same name which flows through its center; this had been named by early French explorers, as France had claimed this territory through the eighteenth century. The name Papillion is derived from the French term (papillon) for butterfly. According to local tradition, the early French explorers named the creek as Papillon because they saw so many butterflies along its grassy banks.usgennet.org - Nebraska place names - Sarpy County - accessed 2011-09-08 The spelling was changed through a transliteration of the French word. Papillion was platted in 1870 when the railroad was extended to that point. Papillion (sometimes referred to as \\"Papio\\" by its residents) is one of the last of the late 18th-century, Paris-inspired frontier cities left in the Midwestern United States. Halleck Park, a recreation area in the heart of the city, includes many trails, open spaces, trees and a number of areas of interest, including Papio Fun Park, Papio Bay Aquatic Park, Papio Pool, and Papio Bowl. The park also offers tennis courts, volleyball courts, playgrounds, \\"The Duck Pond\\", Monarch Field (\\"The Pit\\"), and E.A. Fricke Field. It also has nine other softball diamonds within the park for youth. The diamonds are sited on three fields: Halleck, Blonde, and Papio Bay. Village Park, Papio Bay Aquatic Center (including two water slides and a zero depth pool) and Walnut Creek recreational park are among the other recreational amenities in the city. Papillion Middle School is in the downtown area south of Papio Creek; the building formerly was used as the high school until August 1971. The former junior high was located directly west, across the street. Also downtown are the Old A.W.

Other areas of interest in Papillion include the Sarpy County Court House and Jail, Shadow Lake Towne Center, and Midlands Hospital, all along Nebraska Highway 370 in the southern portion of the city. Papillion has a Triple-A minor league baseball team. Werner Park, located (5 km) west of the city on Highway 370 in unincorporated Sarpy County, opened in 2011 as the new home of the Omaha Storm Chasers of the Pacific Coast League. The Storm Chasers were formerly the Omaha Royals; after 42 years at Rosenblatt Stadium in south Omaha, the team moved out following the 2010 season and changed their nickname. They have been the only AAA- affiliate of the Kansas City Royals, an expansion club that entered the American League in 1969. Politics Papillion City Hall Papillion is divided into four wards, with two councilmembers elected from each. One seat for each ward is up for election every two years, with each term lasting four years. The mayor is the head of the city council and is elected at-large to four-year terms.

The population was 2,453 at the 2010 census. History Ashland is located at the site of a low-water limestone ledge along the bottom of Salt Creek, an otherwise mud- bottomed stream that was a formidable obstacle for wagon trains on the great westward migrations of the late 1840s and 1850s. The Oxbow Trail, a variant route of the Oregon Trail, ran from Nebraska City (on the Missouri River) to Fort Kearny (on the Platte River), where it joined the main route of the Oregon Trail. The limestone bottom of Salt Creek at Ashland made it an excellent fording site. Ashland was established in 1870 and named after Ashland, the estate of Henry Clay. Today, Ashland benefits by its proximity to Interstate 80 and the cities of Omaha and Lincoln. While in some respects Ashland is becoming a \\"bedroom community\\" of those much larger cities, it retains a rural character.

It had the Nebraska legislature proclaim him an admiral in the Great Navy of the State of Nebraska, as well as inundate Letterman with letters, postcards, and bribes of flowers, clothing, animals, alcoholic beverages, shredded money, and free checkups at the Wahoo Medical Center. When Letterman jokingly said he wanted more, Wahoo sent him a '76 Ford Pinto with a sofa attached to the hood, a wall clock made of cow droppings, and two of the town's teenagers, brothers Jeff and Josh Price. This brought some degree of fame and tourism to the town. The nightly recap of the show on the CBS web site is titled The Wahoo Gazette.

It is part of the Lincoln, Nebraska Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 216 at the 2010 census.  History  In 1874, the Midland Pacific Railroad built the first railway in Seward County, laying tracks from Lincoln to Seward. To finance the construction of the new line, the railroad sought money from the county. However, the residents of the southern portion of the county voted overwhelmingly against the bond issue in an 1871 election: they were displeased at having been bypassed by an earlier railroad line, anticipated no benefits from the new line, and were angry with Seward, which had won the county seat away from the southern town of Milford. The failure of the bond issue forced the railroad to seek support from the northern portions of the county; so rather than following the desirable route up the valley of Middle Creek, the company agreed to build the line through Malcolm and then up into the hills of northeastern Seward County. This measure won enough support for the bonds to be approved in 1872. A depot was established on a level place along the line, and the town of Germantown, named for the ethnicity of the local settlers, was platted in 1874 by Hiland Fraisure. With the entry of the United States into World War I, anti-German sentiment was rampant. German-language newspapers were closed and German- language Lutheran church services were ended. Sauerkraut was dubbed \\"liberty cabbage\\", and dachshunds \\"liberty hounds\\". In this environment, the Germantown city council decided that the name had to be changed; and they resolved to rename the town after the first local soldier to die during the war. Although several residents later fell by enemy action, the resolution had failed to specify the manner of death; so the honor went to Raymond Garland, who died of pneumonia before he ever reached France. On December 11, 1918, a month after the signing of the Armistice, Germantown became Garland. Geography Garland is located at (40.945501, -96.985926).

Marx arrived at the name because he liked the lyric \\"this old Nebraska town.\\" He wrote to Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, asking for a list of Nebraska towns with two syllables and found Hazard ideal for its double meaning. (The lyrics refer to a river, which the real Hazard does not possess; however, there is a muddy creek.) Although the song didn't cast the town in a positive light, the locals invited Marx to be Grand Marshal at Sherman County's Fourth of July parade in 1993, an invite that the singer accepted.

Alexandria grew rapidly; its early growth was augmented by residents and businesses moving from the town of Meridian, established as the county seat of Jones County (now Jefferson County) but bypassed by the railroad and eventually abandoned. The town supported a flour mill on Big Sandy Creek; a newspaper, the Alexandrian, was established in 1879; and by 1882, there were four churches. The town was beset by three severe storms in the decade following its establishment. In 1875, a tornado levelled a school building that had just been completed at a cost of $6,000. A second storm, in 1877, did only minor damage; a third, in 1881, produced several fatalities and widespread property damage. Sports For many years, Alexandria fielded a men's softball team that played other town teams from around the state, and then venturing to the State Tournament in Hastings. Alexandria has claimed two trophies from the Tournament, a third place in Class D-2 in 2002 and a State Championship in class D in 1996. The local leagues have since fizzled out, and many teams around the area have dissolved, but Alexandria has still taken a team to the State Tournament to compete until 2012.http://www.nebraskasoftball.org Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

Railroad operations brought a measure of prosperity to the town, and promoted its growth. Between 1918 and 1923, the Potash Highway, running from Grand Island to Alliance, was constructed parallel to the Burlington's route; it ran through the center of Seneca. The town boasted a number of retail businesses, including hotels, banks, a lumberyard, a railroad cafe, and an automobile dealership. For some years, it was the largest municipality in Thomas County, reaching a peak population of 476 in 1920.Nebraska Historic Highway Survey. Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 2011-10-05. pp. 87-99. In 1926, the Potash Highway was reconfigured as Nebraska Highway 2. In the early 1940s, a re-alignment to reduce the number of railroad crossings shifted the highway to the south of Seneca. The railroad moved its operations out of the town, eliminating jobs and causing the loss of population and the closing of additional businesses.Sources differ on the dates on which railroad facilities in Seneca were closed. According to Hugley et al. (1989), \\"the railroad pulled out of the town in the [sic] 1922\\". According to Hanson, the roundhouse closed \\"[n]ot long after the highway moved\\" (in the late 1940s), and \\"[i]n 1973, Seneca ceased being a crew-change point\\". In about 2013, a dispute arose over the Village Board's passage of an ordinance prohibiting the keeping of horses in the town. It gave rise to a petition to disincorporate Seneca; in May 2014, the residents voted for disincorporation by a 17-16 margin, and the village was dissolved by the Thomas County Board at the end of June 2014.Hansen, Matthew. \\"Hansen: How tiny Seneca, Nebraska ‚Äì torn apart by bitterness ‚Äì voted itself out of existence\\".

A municipal borough until 1974, Buxton was then merged with other localities lying primarily to the north, including Glossop, to form the local government district and borough of High Peak within the county of Derbyshire. It is also near to Greater Manchester. The population of the town was 22,115 at the 2011 Census. Buxton landmarks include Poole's Cavern, an extensive limestone cavern open to the public, and St Ann's Well, fed by the geothermal spring bottled and sold internationally by Buxton Mineral Water Company. Also in the town is the Buxton Opera House, which hosts several music and theatre festivals each year. The Devonshire Campus of the University of Derby is housed in one of the town's historic buildings. Buxton is twinned with two towns: Oignies in France and Bad Nauheim in Germany.Town Twinning website History The origins of the town's name are uncertain.

The Stone Age settlement (a Scheduled Monument) was discovered in 1984 with remains of a Mesolithic timber roundhouse & Neolithic longhouses. = Roman settlement = The Romans developed a settlement known as Aquae Arnemetiae (or the baths of the goddess of the grove). The discovery of coins indicates that the Romans were in Buxton throughout their occupation.About Buxton , History of Buxton, accessed June 2009 Batham Gate (\\"road to the bath town\\") is a Roman road from Templebrough Roman fort in South Yorkshire to Navio Roman Fort and on to Buxton. = Middle Ages = The town's name Buckestones was first recorded in the 12th-century as part of Peverel family's estate. From 1153 the town became part of the Duchy of Lancaster's Crown estate, close to the Royal Forest of the Peak (which lay on the Fairfield side of the River Wye). In the 1200s monastic farms were set up in Fairfield. In the 1300s the town's Royal ownership was reflected in its name of Kyngesbucstones. By 1460 Buxton's spring had been pronounced a holy well dedicated to St Anne (who was canonised in 1382) and a chapel had been built by 1498. =Spa town boom= People filling up bottles with water at St Ann's Well Buxton Wells, from a 1610 map Built on the River Wye, and overlooked by Axe Edge Moor, Buxton has a history as a spa town due to its geothermal springDunn, Paul. \\"Great British Weekend: Buxton\\", The Sunday Times, 17 April 2010, accessed 20 September 2011 which rises at a constant temperature of 28 ¬∞C. The spring waters are piped to St Ann's Well (a shrine to St. Anne since medieval times) at the foot of The Slopes, opposite the Crescent near the town centre. The well was declared to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Peak by philosopher Thomas Hobbes in his 1636 book De Mirabilibus Pecci: Being The Wonders of the Peak in Darby-shire. The Dukes of Devonshire have been closely involved with Buxton since 1780, when the 5th Duke used the profits from his copper mines to develop the town as a spa in the style of Bath. Their ancestor Bess of Hardwick had taken one of her four husbands, the Earl of Shrewsbury, to \\"take the waters\\" at Buxton shortly after he became the gaoler of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1569, and they took Mary there in 1573. She called Buxton \\"La Fontagne de Bogsby\\", and stayed at the site of the Old Hall Hotel. The area features in the poetry of W. H. Auden and the novels of Jane Austen and Emily Bront√´. Buxton in 1965 with shoppers and tourists filling Spring Gardens Instrumental in the popularity of Buxton was the recommendation by Erasmus Darwin of the waters at Buxton and Matlock to Josiah Wedgwood I.

Two of Charles Darwin's half-cousins, Edward Levett Darwin and Reginald Darwin, settled there.Darwin, Charles, Frederick Burkhardt and Sydney Smith. The Correspondence of Charles Darwin, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1985 The arrival of the railway in 1863 stimulated the town's growth: the population of 1,800 in 1861 had grown to over 6,000 by 1881.Railways of the Peak District, Blakemore & Mosley, 2003 Geography and geology Although outside the National Park boundary, Buxton is geologically in the Peak District and built between the Lower Carboniferous limestone of the White Peak and the Upper Carboniferous shale, sandstone and gritstone of the Dark Peak. The early settlement (of which only the parish church of St Anne, built in 1625, remains) was largely of limestone construction while the present buildings, of locally quarried sandstone, mostly date from the late 18th century. At the southern edge of the town the River Wye has carved an extensive limestone cavern, known as Poole's Cavern. More than 330 yards (300 metres) of its chambers are open to the public. The cavern contains Derbyshire's largest stalactite and there are unique 'poached egg' stalagmites. A notorious local highwayman called Poole gave the cavern its name.Oldham, T. \\"History of Poole's Cavern\\" , Showcaves.com (2002) =Climate= At about above sea level, Buxton is the highest market town in England.

The present building dates from 1670 and has a five-bay front with a Tuscan doorway.Information about Buxton buildings Buxton Crescent and St Ann's Well The Crescent was built between 1780 and 1784, modelled on Bath's Royal Crescent by John Carr along with the neighbouring irregular octagon and colonnade of the Great Stables. The Crescent features a grand assembly room with a fine painted ceiling. Nearby stands the elegant and imposing monument to Samuel Turner (1805‚Äì1878), treasurer of the Devonshire Hospital and Buxton Bath Charity, built in 1879 and accidentally lost for the latter part of the 20th century during construction work before being found and restored in 1994. The Crescent has been unoccupied for many years, but plans were in place in 2012 for it to be converted into a hotel.\\"Historic agreement paves way for Crescent development\\" , High Peak Borough Council, 2 April 2012 Corbar Hill and the Dome The neighbouring Great Stables were completed in 1789, but in 1859 were largely converted to a charity hospital for the 'sick poor' by Henry Currey, architect to William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire and previously of St Thomas' Hospital in London. It became known as the Devonshire Royal Hospital in 1934. Later phases of the conversion following 1881 were by local architect Robert Rippon Duke including his design for The Devonshire Dome, which was the world's largest unsupported dome with a diameter of , larger than the Pantheon at , St Peter's Basilica at in Rome, and St Paul's Cathedral at . The record was surpassed by space frame domes such as the Georgia Dome (). The building and its surrounding Victorian villas are now part of the University of Derby. Currey also designed The Natural Mineral Baths, opened in 1854 on the site of the original Roman baths, and The Pump Room, built in 1884 opposite The Crescent. The Natural Baths feature a barrel-vaulted stained glass canopy ‚Äî the largest stained glass window in Britain ‚Äî designed by the artist Brian Clarke, and were re-developed as an arcade in 1987.\\"Natural Mineral Baths, Buxton\\" , BritishListedBuildings.co.uk, accessed 4 May 2012 Visitors could 'take the waters' at The Pump Room until 1981. Between 1981 and 1995 the building housed the unique Micrarium Exhibition.Micrarium Enterprises The building is being refurbished as part of the National Lottery-funded Buxton Crescent and Thermal Spa re-development. Beside it, added in 1940, is St Ann's Well. When the railways arrived in Buxton in 1863, Buxton railway station was opened under the design of Joseph Paxton, previously gardener and architect to William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. Paxton also designed the layout of the Park Road circular estate; he is perhaps most famous for his design of the Crystal Palace in London. = Other architecture = Buxton Opera House was designed by Frank Matcham in 1903 and is the highest opera house in the country. Matcham was a prolific theatrical architect who designed several London theatres, including the London Palladium, the London Coliseum and the Hackney Empire. Opposite is an original Penfold octagonal post box. The opera house is attached to the Pavilion Gardens, Octagonal Hall (built in 1875) and the smaller Pavilion Arts Centre (previously called The Hippodrome and the Playhouse Theatre). The Buxton Pavilion Gardens, designed by Edward Milner, contain 93,000 m¬≤ of gardens and ponds and were opened in 1871. The Pavilion Gardens is a Grade II* listed public park of Special Historic Interest and Milner's design was a development of Joseph Paxton's landscape design of the Serpentine Walks from the 1830s.

In the other direction, on Corbar Hill, 1,433 feet (437 m) above sea level, is Corbar Cross, a tall, wooden cross. Originally given to the Roman Catholic Church by the Duke of Devonshire in 1950 to commemorate Holy Year, it was replaced in the 1980s.

On March 22, 2016, the United States Supreme Court resolved a disagreement as to whether Pender is located on the Omaha Indian Reservation, holding unanimously that \\"the disputed land is within the reservation‚Äôs boundaries.\\" The predominantly European-American population was 1,002 at the 2010 census. The village is the county seat of Thurston County. European-American settlers founded the village in April 1885, naming it in honor of the Scottish politician and businessman Sir John Pender, a pioneer of the Transatlantic Cable. He founded what is now Cable & Wireless Worldwide, and was a director of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railway.Honoring Pender's 125th Anniversary, Legislative Resolution 570 Geography Pender is located at (42.111563, -96.710612). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. Current issues Tribal authorities of the federally recognized Omaha Nation assert that Pender is within the boundaries of the reservation as defined in its 1865 treaty with the United States. However, a Nebraska state court held in 1999 that the western boundary was a railroad right-of-way east of Pender, because of Omaha land sales to white farmers over the decades. The tribe's response is that the state does not have the power to redefine the boundary set by the Omaha treaty with the US government in 1865.Paul Hammel, ‚ÄúDebate Over Tribal Jurisdiction at Standstill Police on the Omaha Reservation; Want the Authority to Arrest non-Indians,‚Äù, Omaha World Herald (Nebraska), 15 February 2004, p. 3b, accessed 27 February 2012 The boundary and jurisdiction issues have received recent testing related to traffic control and liquor sales.Paul Hammel, \\"Nebraska, Indian Officials to Meet They Will Discuss Their Differences Over the Boundaries of the Omaha Tribe's Reservation and who Polices its Roads\\", Omaha World-Herald, 7 January 2003, 1b Seeking to gain revenue from \\"nuisance\\" businesses, the Omaha in 2006 passed a law establishing the requirement for liquor merchants to pay the tribe license fees and a 10% sales tax to operate within the reservation. It notified the seven liquor stores in Pender, as well as those in Rosalie, and Walthill, Nebraska, all within reservation boundaries, that as of January 1, 2007, they would have to pay the Omaha Tribe licensing fees and a 10 percent tax on sales in order to continue to operate within the reservation. Ben Thompson, an Omaha attorney who represents the tribe, said that it had the legal right to establish such laws within the reservation. The executive director of the Nebraska State Liquor Commission said that he would consult with the state attorney general on the issue.Paul Hammel, \\"Tribe's Liquor Tax May Restart Old Boundary Dispute,\\" , Omaha World-Herald (Nebraska), 28 December 2006, p. 03B, at H-Amindian Discussion Log, accessed 27 February 2012 In April 2007, liquor merchants in Pender (later joined by the village) filed a federal lawsuit challenging the tribe's authority to demand the liquor taxes, based on their contention that Pender was outside the reservation boundaries. In October 2007 the US District Court ordered the parties first to take their challenge to the Omaha Tribal Courts, as part of the \\"tribal exhaustion doctrine\\" established by federal precedent, and denied the plaintiffs' request for dismissal. Judge Richard Kopf said he may not be bound by the tribal court, but wanted to hear their opinion.Timberly Ross (Associated Press), \\"Judge orders liquor lawsuit to Omaha tribal court\\", News from Indian Country, October 2007, accessed 1 March 2012 He required the parties to report back to him regularly until a ruling was made by the Omaha Tribal Courts. While the case was pending, the judge ordered a temporary stay on the merchants' paying the liquor sales tax to the Omaha Tribe. In January 2012, the plaintiffs in Pender v. Omaha Tribe filed a request with the Omaha Tribal Courts for a summary judgment due to the length of time the case had taken. The defendants requested that no hearing be held before June 2012. The plaintiffs had submitted a detailed report to them by an expert witness on transactions related to Pender and the western boundary. In 2008 the village had voted for a five-year, 1% sales tax to finance its lawsuit related to the boundary and liquor tax issues, as well as to promote economic development in the town.\\"Pender has spent $285,000 on reservation boundary dispute\\", The Pender Times online, January 2012, accessed 1 March 2012 On March 22, 2016, the Supreme Court unanimously held that Pender was within the boundaries of the Omaha Indian reservation.

History  The village of Milford began with the building of a sawmill by Elizur and Stanley Ruggles in 1832.Lowe, S. D., Bourns, M. J., Young, B. B., & Barr, C. L. (1982). Ten minutes ahead of the rest of the world: A history of Milford. Milford, MI: Milford Historical Society. Early county records indicate that the mill was erected in the \\"Township\\" at that time, and that formal organization would occur in 1834. That same year, the first gristmill was erected by Luman Fuller. In 1835, the first post office was established with Aaron Phelps as postmaster. The Lower Mill Pond was created in 1836 to provide waterpower for the various types of mills and factories. The Upper Mill Pond followed in 1845. In 1911, the Hubbell Pond was created by a dam built on the Huron River to generate electricity. The village was incorporated in 1869. Hydropower made it possible for Milford to become one of the first communities to have electric lights, in 1892. A year later, telephone service was available in the Village. As a point of reference, nearby South Lyon did not have electric lights until 1932. By 1939, Henry Ford built a carburetor plant and two hydroelectric stations intended to allow residents to maintain their agricultural work while working in the factories. The former carburetor plant was demolished in 2002. The Art Deco station still remains on Pettibone Creek in the village, and restoration work began in 2004.

The first European explorers in the Ottawa County region were the French-Canadian explorers Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette, who passed through the region in the mid 17th century. European settlement in the area proceeded slowly until the mid 19th century, when zinc was discovered in Crockery Creek in 1858. (Barnes, 1997) In 1872, the town of Nunica was officially incorporated, the name taken from the Ottawa word for zinc. The 1880 census showed approximately 1,000 settlers in the region.

Boulder City is one of only two places in Nevada that prohibits gambling, the other being the town of Panaca. History =Beginnings as federal company town= The land upon which Boulder City was founded was a harsh, desert environment. Its sole reason for existence was the need to house workers contracted to build the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River (known commonly as Boulder Dam from 1933 to 1947, when it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress). Men hoping for work on the dam project had begun settling along the river in tents soon after the precise site for the dam had been chosen by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1930. Their ramshackle edifices were collectively known as \\"Ragtown\\".Boulder City City Design.

The sheer scale of the dam and duration of the project required the Bureau of Reclamation to consider the construction of a semi- permanent town rather than a temporary arrangement.Boulder City Documentary Manuscript. Accessed 5 April 2011 Boulder City was exceptionally rare as an example of a town fully planned under government supervision. This is unlike 19th century privately funded company town examples found in the United Kingdom, such as Port Sunlight, or in the United States, such as Pullman, Chicago. =Early years: 1930‚Äì1934= Boulder City, 1932 Boulder City was carefully planned through federal supervision as a model community, with Dutch-born urban architect Saco Rienk de Boer contracted to plan it. DeBoer had been a planner for Denver, Colorado, and was to design many towns and suburbs around the Rocky Mountain region. Because the Hoover Dam project itself represented a focus for optimism for a country suffering from the effects of the Great Depression, the town itself was to be an additional manifestation of this optimism. There was to be an emphasis on a clean-living environment for dam workers. The plan submitted by DeBoer in 1930 was formal and symmetrical with a park and the Bureau of Reclamation building at the termination of the two main axes.Cheryl Ferrence, Around Boulder City. Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina, 2008, p 10. The plan was deemed too expensive to carry out in its original form and was modified to allow for more regular block sizes. Nevertheless, its allowance for public space and copious amounts of landscaping earned it the moniker \\"Nevada's Garden City\\".\\"Henry Kaiser\\". Accessed 10 April 2011. The provision of green landscape was another expression of the Bureau of Reclamation's \\"mission to reclaim and 'green' the American West.\\"\\"Nevada: Landscaping of the Bureau of Reclamation Regional Office, Boulder City\\" . Accessed 10 April 2011. The town was designed to house approximately 5,000 workers. The status of the workers on the Hoover Dam was reflected in their house sizes and locations. The most important employees had their residences on top of the hill nearer the apex. Managers were housed further down the hill, and dwellings for manual laborers were located furthest away from the public buildings and parks.M. Gottdiener, Claudia C. Collins, David R. Dickens, Las Vegas: The Social Production of an All-American City. Blackwell, Malden, Massachusetts, 1999, p. 128 The most radically modified portions of DeBoer's plan were in these lower-class residential blocks, where open space and parks were largely eliminated. Commercial development was restricted and severely regulated under Sims Ely, the city manager. There were limits to the number of different types of stores allowed in the city, and all who wished to begin a business were screened for character and financial viability.Andrew J. Dunar, Dennis McBride, Building Hoover Dam: an Oral History of the Great Depression. University of Nevada Press, Las Vegas, Nevada, 2001, p. 119 On the other hand, there was no provision for schools in the burgeoning city, probably because the Bureau of Reclamation expected that single male workers would populate the town.Dunar & McBride, p. 127 The town made do with makeshift schoolrooms until the city won the right for state- funded schools to be established on the federal reservation upon which Boulder City was situated. No hospitals were provided in the city either. Injured workers had to travel to Las Vegas Hospital, and when a hospital was established in the city, females were not admitted for a number of years.Dunar & McBride, p. 128 =Similarity to earlier company towns= Like early model company town Port Sunlight, the workers of Boulder City were under strict monitoring: alcohol was prohibited in the town until 1969, and gambling has been prohibited since the city's outset.Gottdiener, Collins & Dickens, p. 128 The city was founded during the Prohibition era. Boulder Theatre, established in 1931, meant that workers were not obliged to travel to Las Vegas for amusements. Such measures were common for company towns dating back to the 19th century, since sober workers surrounded by their own gardens and provided with appropriate entertainment would be more productive during their working days. In the case of Boulder City, the prohibition of alcohol and gambling was at least partly due to the proximity of Las Vegas, which had a notoriously rowdy vice district. Visitors to Boulder City were admitted by permit, and by 1932, there was a gatehouse through which all visitors had to pass.Dunar & McBride, p 109 =Trendsetter for decentralization= While the establishment of Boulder City occurred while Las Vegas was modest in size with approximately 5,000 inhabitants, it was effectively the beginning of the fragmentation of cities in the region of Clark County. This move to disperse to multiple centers predated the decentralization movement of the 1970s. The nearby city of Henderson, founded in 1943 and based around the magnesium industry, was another early example of decentralization before Clark County had a significant population: \\"...the region began to decentralize and regroup as a multi-centered area early in its history.\\"Gottdiener, Collins & Dickens, p. 26 The independent governments of Henderson, North Las Vegas, Las Vegas, and Boulder City have perpetuated the fragmented nature of the region, giving each city its individual character, as well as generally stymieing the outward growth of these cities.Gottdiener, Collins & Dickens, p. 28 =1960s onwards= The government did not relinquish control of Boulder City until 1959, when the town was incorporated. Boulder City's incorporation ceremony took place on January 4, 1960. The city council selected pharmacist Robert N. Broadbent as the town's first mayor. The city charter, approved by the residents, prohibited gambling within the city limits. This provision still exists, making Boulder City one of only two locations in Nevada where gambling is illegal (the other is the town of Panaca). The Hoover Dam Lodge hotel- casino permits gambling and has a Boulder City mailing address, but it is located on a parcel of private land within the boundaries of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area and thus not within city limits. Another casino on the other end of town is the Railroad Pass Hotel and Casino, which has a Boulder City telephone prefix, but is within the boundary of the neighboring city of Henderson. Alcohol sales were first permitted in 1969. On August 9, 2018, the Boulder City Bypass opened to the public as part of the Interstate 11 project. The bypass is still within Boulder City's city limit, but bypasses the populated area. Initially, businesses and the populace were concerned that the bypass would have a negative effect on the local economy, though it seems that the opposite was true for some businesses. =Accolades= In 2009, Money magazine ranked Boulder City sixth in its annual list of the top 25 places to retire in the United States, which was based on affordable housing, medical care, tax rates and arts and leisure.MONEY Magazine: 25 Best Places To Retire(6) 2009: Boulder City, NV snapshot Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.02%, is water.

It is named after Edward Bunker, who was already a seasoned pioneer settler before he came to Bunkerville, having pioneered the settlement at Santa Clara, Utah.Bunker, Gaylen (2006). \\"Chapter 17: Bunkerville\\". The Annotated Edward Bunker. Bunker, on his own initiative but with permission from Brigham Young, moved his large polygamous family southwest to Bunkerville after the settlers in Santa Clara had failed to live the communitarian United Order. The residents of Bunkerville, so named by Brigham Young, established a new communal effort, sharing the work and the fruits of their work, with all land being held in common. The communal experiment ended in 1880. According to the Federal Writers' Project, Bunkerville had 287 inhabitants in 1941. In the 1950s, Bunkerville was downwind of nuclear test sites, which caused a spike in childhood leukemia and other cancers in the region. Residents recall playing in nuclear fallout as if it were snow, and report a lasting mistrust of the government. In the spring of 2014, Bunkerville was the scene of the Bundy standoff, an armed confrontation between protesters and law enforcement over the non-payment of the grazing fees by Cliven Bundy, a local rancher.

The population was 108,481 at the 2010 U.S. Census, up from 14,676 at the 2000 census. It was founded on December 17, 1996. Like other unincorporated towns in the Las Vegas Valley, it uses Las Vegas ZIP Codes for addresses within its boundaries. History The first inhabitants of what is now Enterprise would have been the Paiute Indians, who were spread across the Las Vegas Valley. In 1905, the railroad town of Arden was formed for miners who worked at the nearby gypsum mines just west of the area. The area was part of Lincoln County until 1909, when Clark County was split off from Lincoln County. The oldest structure in the area is a water tower, which was built in 1926. References to the area as \\"Enterprise\\" date back to at least 1918, when county commissioners established an Enterprise school district. According to one historian, the word may simply have been chosen at that time as a positive-sounding name. On April 21, 1958, United Airlines Flight 736 and an Air Force jet collided into each other, causing 49 fatalities. A metal cross was put up by the son of a victim in 1999 on the site of the crash. Enterprise was formed as an unincorporated town on December 17, 1996, in response to a petition from residents who hoped it would help preserve the community's semi-rural identity. This was made to prevent annexation by nearby Henderson. Immediately afterwards, Clark County commissioners voted to annex about five square miles of land into neighboring Spring Valley that included the master-planned community of Rhodes Ranch and a regional park. The annexation plan was developed by commissioner Erin Kenny. The vote was almost unanimous, with the sole exception of Bruce L. Woodbury voting against annexation. The chairwoman of the county commission, Yvonne Atkinson Gates, was against the annexation, but voted for annexation anyway because she wanted to recall the situation after the next advisory board meeting in January 1997. Residents, both governmental and non-governmental, opposed the annexation because they had no say in the vote. On January 19, 1999, an interlocal agreement was approved by the Clark County Commission and the Henderson City Council to annex about 5,000 to 6,000 acres of land into the City of Henderson, with most of the land belonging to the Bureau of Land Management southwest of the master-planned community of Anthem, but also including 1,400 acres that were part of Enterprise. The city wanted to annex land so it could have an exit on Interstate 15 (specifically the Sloan exit ), and so they could maintain Lake Mead Drive (now St. Rose Parkway). Residents of Enterprise did not approve of the annexation plan because they wanted to preserve their rural lifestyle. County commissioners told some residents that the county could not stop Henderson from annexing a piece of their town, and said that the interlocal agreement was the best they could do. This agreement stopped Henderson from annexing section 33 (which was a heavily populated section of Enterprise), and instead annex sections 26 and 34, which were, at the time, undeveloped. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place (CDP) of Enterprise (which may not coincide exactly with the town boundaries) has a total area of 46.51 square miles (120.5 km2).

The population was 229 at the 2010 census. History The Pioneer Saloon, built in 1913 Named for Joseph Good, whose cattle frequented a spring nestled in the southeastern foothills of the Spring Mountains, Goodsprings was once the heart of the most productive mining districts in Clark County. Over the years, lead, silver, copper, zinc and gold have all been mined from this area. Before 1900, a small cluster of tent cabins and a mill were erected, and a post office. Lincoln County established Goodsprings Township. In 1904, Salt Lake City mining interests platted the Goodsprings Township. Most early buildings in the town were constructed during the boom spurred by the railroad in 1910‚Äì1911. After a number of moves, the current Goodsprings Schoolhouse was erected in 1913. Now on the National Register of Historic Places, it is the oldest school in Clark County that was built as a school and is still used as a school. Due to a shortage of funds, however, the Clark County School District is currently considering shutting the school down. After World War I, mining slowed and families moved away. World War II created a second boom, but it too slowed after the war ended. The town's population has dwindled to approximately 200. Goodsprings is currently the home of the Pioneer Saloon, considered to be one of the oldest saloons in Nevada (over 100 years old). The saloon houses a bullet hole on the side of the building and a coroner's letter describing how it was created. The saloon is said by many to be haunted by the victim's ghost. In addition, the Pioneer Saloon has a small memorial to both Clark Gable and Carole Lombard. Ms. Lombard's plane TWA Flight 3 crashed into nearby Potosi Mountain on January 16, 1942. The saloon and hotel were the centers of operations for the search. The accident resulted in her death. The Goodsprings Waste Heat Recovery Station opened in 2010, providing 7.5MW (nameplate) of energy from waste heat produced at a Kern River Pipeline compressor station.

The population was 991 at the 2010 census. History The community was named for the fact Indians had settled on the springs near the original town site. In 1906, Indian Springs became a way station and watering place for the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad. The original rail line ran under what is now US 95. The LV&T; ceased operation in 1918. =Army Air Forces to Air Force Base= Indian Springs Auxiliary Airfield also known as Indian Springs Field, was rapidly constructed in Nevada by the United States Army Air Forces the month after the Pearl Harbor attack. Indian Springs was immediately entered into service as a training camp for Army Air Force B-25 air-to-air gunnery training, and as a divert field for Las Vegas Army Airfield. In 1947, Las Vegas AAF was inactivated, and so was Indian Springs. One year later, Indian Springs was reactivated as Indian Springs Air Force Base by the new United States Air Force, with a new role as a new weapons systems and aircraft research and testing. Among these missions were support for nuclear arms testing at the Nevada Proving Grounds, high-altitude balloon search and retrieval, new gunnery and rocketry systems, and testing of experimental aircraft. For a period of the 1950s and 1960s Indian Springs AFB housed some of the most advanced aircraft and air weapons systems in the world. In the 1960s, Indian Springs AFB was transferred to the Tactical Air Wing and re- designated as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field. The Indian Springs mission was focused on monitoring of Nellis range, and became the remote training site of the USAF Thunderbirds elite air demonstration squadron. The 1982 \\"Diamond Crash\\" caused the deaths of four Thunderbird pilots and hastened their transition from the T-38A Talon to the F-16C Fighting Falcon. Creech Air Force Base Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field was renamed Creech Air Force Base in 2005, in honor of General Wilbur L. \\"Bill\\" Creech, a former commander of the Tactical Air Command.http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wlcreech.htm Also in the 2000s, Creech AFB began to host the 432d Wing and 432d Air Expeditionary Wing, operating/flying unmanned aerial vehicles, and returning the base to its history as a base of advanced special aircraft development. The base also hosts the operations of the 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron and 99th Ground Combat Training Squadron, The National Desert Warfare Center, and those of the Air Force Reserve's 78th Reconnaissance Squadron, 91st RS, and Nevada Air National Guard's 232nd Operations Squadron. =\\"Wild Bill\\" Williams= George and Belle Lattimer owned a ranch where the Indian Springs Hotel & Casino was located until October 1, 2014 when it was closed by the USAF to expand a security buffer around Creech AFB. In 1906, George Lattimer was bitten by an insect, or perhaps a brown recluse spider, and Belle hitched the wagon to take him into the doctor. A 16-year-old Paiute Indian boy named Coachie Siegmuller was left to watch the ranch. While they were gone, Siegmuller saw another Paiute named Bill \\"Wild Bill\\" Williams approached the ranch. Williams was known as \\"bad\\" and Siegmuller was terrified of him. Williams was notorious for exploiting young Paiute men by hiring them out to local ranchers and then pocketing their wages. Williams was there that day to collect some of these wages. Finding no one home, Williams stretched out on the porch and was soon fast asleep. Siegmuller felt he needed to defend the ranch, fetched a rifle from the kitchen, silently crept up on Williams, and shot him dead in the head. Coachie Siegmuller pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to death. The area's Paiute Reservation, the Las Vegas Indian Colony, threatened to go to war over the death penalty, and to keep the peace Siegmuller was instead sentenced to three years in the Carson City Prison. The Lattimers buried Wild Bill Williams behind the ranch. Dogs kept digging his remains up, so they were buried a few times before staying under.

Education Indian Springs has a public library, a branch of the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District. Climate Indian Springs experiences a desert climate, typical of southern Nevada. Precipitation is rare throughout the year, and summers are hot, although very low humidity helps temper the effects of the heat. Indian Springs' climate is similar to that of nearby Las Vegas, but with some significant differences. Nighttime temperatures at Indian Springs are much cooler than those in Las Vegas. This is due both to Indian Springs' higher elevation, and the lack of the Urban heat island effect that prevents temperatures in Las Vegas from falling quickly after dark.

Laughlin lies south of Las Vegas, in the far southern tip of Nevada, and is known for its gaming and water recreation. As of the 2010 census, the population was 7,323. The nearby communities of Bullhead City, Arizona; Needles, California; Fort Mohave, Arizona; and Mohave Valley, Arizona, bring the area's total population to about 100,000. Laughlin is also northeast of Los Angeles. Laughlin was named for Don Laughlin, an Owatonna, Minnesota native who purchased the southern tip of Nevada in 1964 (informally called South Pointe). At the time, Don Laughlin operated the 101 Club in Las Vegas. He opened what would become the Riverside Resort, and later wanted to call the community Riverside or Casino, but the post office opted for Laughlin instead. History Avi Resort and Casino Golf Course in Laughlin in 2007 The southernmost tip of Nevada, along the Colorado River, where Nevada, California, and Arizona meet, has become a major national tourist destination and gambling resort within the last few decades. The townsite of Laughlin was established in the 1940s as South Pointe because of the proximity to the southern tip of the state of Nevada. The early town consisted of a motel and bar that catered to gold and silver miners, construction workers building Davis Dam, and fishing enthusiasts. In the 1950s, construction workers left, and the town all but disappeared. In 1964, Don Laughlin, owner of the 101 Club in Las Vegas, flew over the site and saw its tourism potential. He offered to buy the land, and within a few years, the small motel and casino, consisting of only 12 slots and two live tables, was bustling. In 1966, the Riverside Resort built the first 14-floor high-rise; in 1972, 48 rooms were added, followed by several additions. A second casino, the Bobcat Club, opened in 1967, where the Golden Nugget Laughlin currently operates. In 1968, a third casino, the Monte Carlo, opened its doors. Across the river, Bullhead City, Arizona, sat in the glow of the casino light. Shuttle boats transported customers from the Arizona side of the river to Laughlin's resorts and back. The 1980s saw the construction of several more hotels and casinos. The Colorado Hotel (now the Pioneer), The Regency, Sam's Town Gold River (now the Laughlin River Lodge), and The Edgewater opened in the early 1980s. Other investors saw the growth as an opportunity to get in on the action. A second boom resulted in the construction of The Colorado Belle, Harrah's Del Rio, and The Ramada Express (now The Tropicana Express). In 1987, Don Laughlin funded and built the Laughlin Bridge at a cost of $3.5 million. He donated the bridge to the states of Nevada and Arizona. The bridge carries 30,000 vehicles daily. In 1988, a megaresort called the Emerald Resort, that would have been the biggest in southern Nevada, was announced but its first tower was left unfinished due to the junk bond market's collapse in 1990. Only the project's golf course opened and it operated from 1991 to 2005. The Flamingo Hilton, now known as The Aquarius, was built in 1990. Today there are nine hotel/casinos and one motel in Laughlin providing over 10,000 rooms, of meeting space, 60 restaurants, two museums, a 34-lane bowling center, and a variety of boutiques, spas, and salons.

History =Native American= The Moapa Valley was originally settled by the Anasazi people around 350 B.C. Around 500 A.D., farming supplanted hunting as the major food source for the people known as \\"Basketmakers\\". It was also around this time that the art of pottery was introduced. By 600 A.D. the people, now known as \\"Puebloans\\", began building their dwellings above ground, using wood and brush plastered with adobe. Farming was a well-established practice with corn, beans, squash, and cotton being the primary crops. The Puebloans also hunted mule deer, desert bighorn sheep, rabbits, and rodents using bows and arrows. Around 1000 A.D. Southern Paiutes moved into the Moapa Valley area. The Paiutes were hunter-gatherers who did not utilize agriculture as a primary source of subsistence. They lived in temporary brush dwellings, spoke the Southern Paiute language, and practiced a style of pottery that was less sophisticated than the methods used by the Anasazi. The Paiutes and Anasazi people coexisted with little effort in the valley. Sometime around 1150 A.D., the Anasazi abandoned Moapa Valley, possibly due to a drought which gripped the Desert Southwest during that time. When the first European settlers arrived, the Paiutes were relocated to a reservation north of Moapa Town, where they continue to live today. =Settlers= The first Euroamerican settlers in the Moapa Valley were Mormon pioneers in the latter 1860s. The area has remained heavily populated by Mormons to the present time. Many streets bear the names of prominent Mormon families, including Barlow, Hinckley, Leavitt, Lyman, Perkins , Whitmore, Wells, and Andersen. The LDS Logandale Stake has thirteen wards. The Huntsmans, a well known pioneer family of Moapa Valley, established the Huntsman Ranch, which the cabin still remains today near Kane Springs. It is a State of Nevada designated historical site. =Modern times= In 1980, residents of Overton and Logandale approved a referendum on merging the two towns into the town of Moapa Valley. The Clark County Commission affirmed the vote, legally creating Moapa Valley on February 13, 1981. The town had a population of about 1,400 people at the time. Radio stations There are four radio stations licensed to Moapa Valley. KRRN 92.7 has a Spanish format. KXLI 94.5 has a dance format mainly targeted to Las Vegas.

Originally established by Detroit Edison president Alex Dow on land acquired for the Barton Dam, Barton Hills was designed as an exclusive, forested residential enclave just outside Ann Arbor. In 1944, the community was sold to its residents, and a village was incorporated in 1973. As of the 2010 census, the village population was 294. The village is located just northwest of Ann Arbor. The streets in the village were formerly owned by the Barton Hills Maintenance Corporation but were purchased by the village itself in 2010.  History  Adjacent to the City of Ann Arbor, an area known as \\"Huron Farms\\" was established by the Detroit Edison Company in 1913. The company acquired 2,000 acres in Ann Arbor township on both sides of the Huron River to build a series of dams for electric power production, including the Barton Dam. Land owned by the company was also used for agricultural purposes, including farms, dairy cattle, and fruit orchards. Detroit Edison's president, Alex Dow, devote parted of the company's acquisition as an exclusive residential community for company executives. Dow and his wife Vivienne selected a site just north of the Barton Dam, on former pastureland, for their own house. In 1915, the company contracted with the Olmstead Brothers, famous for their park and subdivision designs, as landscape architects for the new community. At first a denuded hill sloping into the pond, jokingly referred to as \\"Barren Hill,\\" the Olmstead Brothers plan prescribed that the area be reforested. When homes were constructed in the 1920s, restrictions attached to each deed stipulated that the homes must be designed by a registered architect. The Barton Hills Country Club, the only business establishment within the township, was founded in 1917. Membership in the Barton Hills Country Club was considered by many to be a mark of distinction. In 2020, about 45% of Barton Hills residents were members of the country club.

The name, popularly believed to refer to the fact that the township is in the northern part of the county, also points back to the New England heritage of many of its first settlers, whose practice it was to bring part of their homeland with them by naming new places after the ones they had left.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 216,961, with an estimated population of 251,974 in 2019. The city was incorporated on May 1, 1946. It is a part of the Las Vegas‚ÄìHenderson‚ÄìParadise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area and is the fourth largest city in the state of Nevada. History During the 1860s, Conrad Kiel established a ranch at the modern- day intersection of Carey Street and Losee Road in what would be North Las Vegas. In 1917, libertarian Thomas L. Williams of Eureka, Utah visited the Las Vegas Valley, back when Las Vegas, Las Vegas Indian Colony, and Arden were the only entities in the valley. He did not approve of Las Vegas, perhaps because of its rowdiness (he was a Christian, or at least went to church), or because Las Vegas' attempts at municipal control over its citizens. However, he was pleased by the abundance of the valley's artesian water and potential for agriculture. Two years later in 1919, he moved himself and his family (his wife and three sons) to a 160 acre piece of land a mile from Las Vegas. That year, he founded his town, developing the town by building he and his family a house, sinking a well, grading roads, extending power lines, and forming a system of irrigation ditches. Williams believed that churches and church people should govern the new town, and so encouraged churches to buy property in the town. In 1919, the federally enforced Volstead Act was passed, which prohibited the sale, possession, and consumption of alcohol. Since there was no local law against alcohol, and because of a system of tunnels that would connect the town's underground speakeasies, the town attracted bootleggers from Las Vegas, although Williams was initially unaware of this. This gave his town the nickname of \\"Old Town\\". When he did discover of it, he sticked with agriculture for his economic purposes. In 1924, Williams built his second house that was the first business of the town. It was named the Oasis Auto Court, and it contained a grocery store, a campground, a post office, a community center, and a telephone. At the time, it was the town's only telephone. Between 1928 and 1935, a large influx of workers from the Hoover Dam settled in Williams' town, as Las Vegas was intolerant towards them. In 1932, the town board was created. That same year, the town's first grammar school, Washington School, opened. A proper name had not yet been established for the town, and Williams did not want it named after himself, which lead to the town board voting for either \\"North Las Vegas\\" or \\"Vegas Verde\\" (which means \\"Green Meadows\\" in Spanish). \\"Vegas Verde\\" won, and that became the name for the town for a few months. George Hansen, a town board member who voted for the name \\"North Las Vegas\\", noticed that at one town board meeting, two members who voted the name \\"Vegas Verde\\" were absent. The vote for a name came once again, and \\"North Las Vegas\\" won. In 1939, Williams died of stroke, and that left North Las Vegas to the ruling of the town board. An elementary school, and a road, were eventually named after him. During World War II, the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School opened in North Las Vegas. It would eventually become Nellis Air Force Base. North Las Vegas was the subject of many annexation attempts from Las Vegas. On May 1, 1946, North Las Vegas was incorporated as a city. In 1957, North Las Vegas planned to annex an area to its southeast, and in response, the Clark County Commission created the town of Sunrise Manor to prevent further annexation attempts. On May 13, 1964, First Lieutenant Raynor Lee Hebert, a student pilot from Port Arthur, Texas, took off from Nellis Air Force Base at approximately 2:00 PM on an F-105 fighter jet. He radioed his flight leader saying that he could not retract his nose gear, and thus couldn't gain altitude. He was at an height high enough to bail out, but too low that if he did, he would've hit Lincoln Elementary School, which was in session with 800 students. He kept the plane nose up long enough to pass the school, and eventually hit nine residential houses on Lenwood Avenue. The crash killed Hebert and four civilians. Hebert Memorial Park was created by the City of North Las Vegas with a plaque at the crash site to commemorate Hebert.\\"JET HITS 9 HOMES, KILLS 5‚Äî F-105 Plows Through Area in N.

The population was 231,858 as of 2017, making it the most populous CDP in the United States and the 4th biggest city in Nevada. As an unincorporated town, it is governed by the Clark County Commission with input from the Paradise Town Advisory Board. Paradise was formed on December 8, 1950. Paradise contains McCarran International Airport; the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV); and most of the Las Vegas Strip. Paradise contains most tourist attractions in the Las Vegas area, excluding downtown. Despite this, the name Paradise remains relatively unknown because all of the ZIP Codes serving Paradise are assigned the default place name \\"Las Vegas\\". History The southern part of the Las Vegas Valley was referred to as Paradise Valley as early as 1910, owing to a high water table that made the land particularly fertile for farming. County commissioners established a Paradise school district in 1914. Neighborhoods on the east side of Paradise In 1950, mayor Ernie Cragin of Las Vegas sought to annex the Las Vegas Strip, which was unincorporated territory, in order to expand the city's tax base to fund his ambitious building agenda and pay down the city's rising debt. A group of casino executives, led by Gus Greenbaum of the Flamingo, lobbied the county commissioners for town status, which would prevent the city from annexing the land without the commission's approval. The commission voted to create the unincorporated town of Paradise on December 8, 1950. The town encompassed a strip one mile wide and four miles long, from the southern city limits of Las Vegas to just south of the Flamingo. The town board initially consisted of five casino managers, chaired by Greenbaum. A month after its establishment, the town was expanded to include the residential areas of Paradise Valley, giving it a total area of . Months later, however, it was reported that county officials had determined that the town had not been properly established, because the petition for the town's formation had an insufficient number of signatures and because it had violated a state law forbidding formation of a town spanning multiple school districts. On August 20, 1951, county commissioners accepted petitions to create two new towns covering the area of the putative town. Town \\"A\\" of Paradise included the areas that lay within a Las Vegas school district, extending from the city limits to a point one mile south, while Town \\"B\\" included the areas within the Paradise school district. In 1953, Town A was renamed as Winchester, and Town B became known simply as Paradise. In 1975, Nevada enacted a law that would have incorporated Paradise (along with Sunrise Manor and Winchester) into the City of Las Vegas. Before it could take effect, however, the bill was struck down as unconstitutional by the Nevada Supreme Court.

The population was 38,144 at the 2010 census, down from 40,008 at the 2000 census. With a population density of at the 2010 census, Lincoln Park is the second most-densely populated municipality in the state after Hamtramck. Lincoln Park contains Council Point Park, which dates back to 1763 when Chief Pontiac met with other tribal leaders along the banks of the Ecorse River to plot a rebellion against increasing European settlers, specifically those in nearby Fort Detroit. The Potawatomi eventually ceded the land to the French in 1776. Lincoln Park is considered part of the Downriver collection of communities within Metro Detroit. The city borders Detroit to the north and also shares borders with Allen Park to the west, Ecorse to the east, Melvindale to the north, and Southgate and Wyandotte to the south. It developed as a bedroom community, providing homes to workers in the nearby steel mills and automobile plants of the Detroit area, while having no industries of its own. Lincoln Park was originally part of the now-defunct Ecorse Township, incorporating as a village in 1921 and again as a city in 1925.  History  Pontiac's council Long before Lincoln Park was incorporated as a city, an area along the Ecorse River was the site of a pivotal meeting during Pontiac's Rebellion. On April 27, 1763, a council of several American Indian tribes from the Detroit region listened to a speech from the Ottawa leader Pontiac. Pontiac urged the listeners to join him in a surprise attack on the British Fort Detroit, which they attempted on May 9. Today, the area is known as Council Point Park, and a small engraved boulder marks the site of the historic meeting. Neighborhoods were first laid in the area of Ecorse Township that would become Lincoln Park in 1906. It was incorporated as a village in 1921, and as a city in 1925. Preston Tucker, famous for his controversial financing and development of the revolutionary 1948 Tucker Sedan, grew up in Lincoln Park in the early 1900s. Tucker joined the Lincoln Park Police Department in his early years to gain access to the high performance cars the department used. During the 20th century, Lincoln Park grew as a bedroom community for the numerous workers at Henry Ford's River Rouge Plant and other mills and factories of the auto industry. Two major shopping hubs were constructed in the 1950s: Lincoln Park Plaza in 1955 on the southeast side and the Lincoln Park Shopping Center the following year on the northwest side. Among Lincoln Park's minor claims to fame is that it was the home of the members of the seminal punk rock group MC5 in the 1960s. The band was rumored to have evolved out of the group's habit of listening to music from a car radio in the parking lot of the local White Castle restaurant in the small downtown area. Gary Grimshaw, a noted rock concert poster artist, grew up in Lincoln Park at the same time. In 2015 the city planned to hold its first Cinco de Mayo event.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The north and south branches of the Ecorse River run through Lincoln Park and join just before leaving the city. Lincoln Park borders the cities of Detroit, Allen Park, Melvindale, Ecorse, Wyandotte, and Southgate.

History After most members of the indigenous tribes were pushed out of the area, ethnic European-American pioneers from New England and New York settled here. The borders of Livonia Township were defined by the Legislature of the Territory of Michigan on March 17, 1835. The settlers named the community \\"Livonia\\", after Livonia, New York, a town in the western part of the state from where many had migrated. \\"The name Livonia was chosen because a number of the earliest settlers had come from western New York, where there was also a town named Livonia.\\"City of Livonia.History.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 539. History According to former U.S. Senator Harry Reid, who has written extensively about his hometown, the most likely story as to how the town received its name was that when George Frederick Colton was looking for gold in the area on May 6, 1897, he supposedly said that it would take a searchlight to find gold ore there. Shortly thereafter he found gold, leading to a boom era when Searchlight had a larger population than Las Vegas. At the time, it was in Lincoln County, Nevada. As talk surfaced for carving Clark County, Nevada out of Lincoln County, Searchlight was initially considered to be the county seat. Between 1907 and 1910 the gold mines produced $7 million in gold and other precious minerals, and the town had a population of about 1,500. The ore was shipped to Barnwell via the Barnwell and Searchlight Railway. Other stories on the origin of the name include a story that Colton was lighting a Searchlight brand match when he discovered the gold ore. Reid dismisses this story, saying that the Searchlight matches were not available in 1898. Yet another story says that Colton thought the area would be a good place because it was on a hill. Colton's mine was called the Duplex, because the gold ore was found on two levels.Harry Colton - 1st100.comSearchlight: The Camp That Didn't Fail, by Harry Reid. University of Nevada Press (January 1998), Searchlight declined after 1917 but hung on as a stop on the Arrowhead Highway. In 1927, U.S. Route 91 bypassed the town and its population dropped to 50. The town had a resurgence in the 1930s and 1940s with the construction of nearby Hoover Dam and was home to the El Rey Bordello in the 1940s and early 1950s until it burned. The last gold mine ceased operating around 1953. Geography =Climate= The city experiences a desert climate (K√∂ppen: BWh) with hot summers and cool winters, but not uncommon temperatures below freezing Searchlight's elevation makes temperatures somewhat cooler than lower-elevation areas in the Mojave Desert, such as Baker, California; Needles, California; and Fort Mohave, Arizona. However, summers can still be extremely hot. Due to Searchlight's altitude and aridity, temperatures drop quickly after sunset, especially in the summer. Daytime highs in the winter are usually well above freezing, and nighttime lows drop below freezing only a few nights a year.

The population was 178,395 at the 2010 census. Spring Valley was formed in May 1981. History In 1965, the Stardust International Raceway was built by the Stardust Resort and Casino. In 1969, the Stardust was sold to the Parvin- Dohrmann Corporation, which had little interest in the raceway and then leased it until in 1970, when Pardee Homes purchased the land. They began developing a master-planned housing community called Spring Valley. The community was named by Doug Pardee and sales manager Jack Whiteman, in reference to its views of the Spring Mountains and its location in the Las Vegas Valley. In 1981, residents grouped together to solicit the Clark County Commission to create an unincorporated town, which it did that May. The residents wanted to create the town due to hypothetical annexations into other communities in the Las Vegas Valley, and because they claimed they did not pay their taxes fairly for county services.

Kris Bryant lived in Spring Valley. =Chinatown= Las Vegas Chinatown Plaza paifang Spring Mountain Road and surrounding streets, from Valley View to Jones Boulevard in Spring Valley and a part of Paradise, is a series of strip malls with ethnic Chinese and other pan-Asian businesses, with the original called Chinatown Plaza. Historically, the strip mall was conceived by Taiwanese American JHK Investment Group, Inc. and opened in 1995. Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn officially designated the area as Chinatown in October 1999 and it continues to grow as the Asian population in Las Vegas expands rapidly. The Chinatown area has gained much popularity, receiving national attention in a 2004 article by The Wall Street Journal (See Further Reading below for the specific citation). Huffington Post classifies Las Vegas Chinatown along with Atlanta- Chamblee, Dallas-Richardson, and North Miami Beach as a \\"modern\\" styled Chinatown, that contrasts with the historic core Chinatowns like New York and San Francisco. The Chinatown is pan-Asian in nature instead of being completely Chinese according to the previous source. The official website for the Chinatown Plaza indicates that Spring Mountain Road is the general corridor for the neighborhood. The history of Chinese population in the Las Vegas Valley shows that the Chinese population remained small throughout most of its history. As a result, a Chinatown could only be created with initiative from entrepreneurs that would in essence fabricate a scenario that came naturally in other large cities that have historically important Chinatowns. According to Tsui in her book, Las Vegas's Chinese population boomed starting from the 1960s and by the 1990s, the Chinese population grew to 15,000 with the majority working in the casino industry. Even as the population grew, the \\"Chinatown experiment\\" could not rely on the local Chinese population to create it, but relied on a label on the plaza itself before people knew it was \\"Chinatown\\". As a saleswoman visiting the Chinatown answered \\"How do I know this is Chinatown?\\" Her answer was \\"Because it says so right on the arch, in Chinese characters (Zhongguo Cheng)\\" According to Tsui's book, Senator Harry Reid \\"... ordered a sign to be put up for Chinatown [along Interstate 15]...\\" but was taken down by the order of the governor of Nevada Bob Miller. In 1996, the Clark County, Nevada designated the area as \\"Chinatown\\". To date, Chinatown Vegas has over 150+ restaurants, 50 foot reflexology and massages spas, 6 large Asian Supermarkets and more than one dozen Chinese and Asian churches.

The town of Whitney was established in 1931, when Whitney subdivided his ranch due to the construction of the Boulder Highway. Much of this land is now within Henderson city limits.

Prior to the 1970s, Whitney was one of a few small communities between Las Vegas and Henderson along Boulder Highway (which was US 93, US 95 and US 466 at the time). Whitney Elementary School was a converted barracks. It housed grades from first to seventh until the 1960s, then the seventh graders were moved to Henderson Junior High. In the early years, the town's post office was operated by John and Nellie Bunch, owners of much of the Whitney property and surrounding areas. The town consisted of three streets running east and west: Whitney Avenue, Keenan Avenue, and Missouri Avenue. Cross streets running north and south were 1st Street, 2nd Street, and 3rd Street. Older students attended Basic High School in Henderson. In the early 1990s, the outward growth of development in Las Vegas and Henderson, as well as the construction of the Interstate 515 bypass of Whitney, had a negative impact on businesses in the area. It wasn't until the early 2000s that business began to recover. The area has seen several new housing developments on vacant land. It was the home to Sam Boyd Stadium (formerly Las Vegas Stadium, Las Vegas Silver Bowl and Sam Boyd Silver Bowl), the home of the UNLV Rebels college football team.

The population was 12,773 at the 2010 census and is 14,146 according to 2019 census estimates. It is located on a set of rapids on the Mississippi River near its confluence with the Sauk River. Sauk Rapids is part of the St. Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area. History BNSF Railway in Sauk Rapids. Sauk Rapids was originally little more than a forest of oak, maple and basswood trees along the Mississippi River until the first home was constructed there in 1851, a large mansion named Lynden Terrace erected by W.H. Wood. Soon other settlers followed and the town was named Sauk Rapids after the rapids just below the Sauk River's mouth on the Mississippi. The new settlement was along the Red River Trails. Soon a general store was built, then a hotel, and a large jail. The first settlers organized a Congregational church that was soon followed by a Methodist, an Episcopalian and a Lutheran church. The first paper outside of St. Paul was the \\"Sauk Rapids Frontiersman,\\" founded in 1854. A flour mill was erected in 1875, but was destroyed in 1886. In 1876, the first bridge was built, was destroyed later in 1876, but rebuilt in 1879. The first school was built in 1886. In 1874, Sauk Rapids was the end of the line for the new railroad. Settlers from as far away as the Red River Valley brought their produce there to ship it. A six-horse stage coach made bi-weekly trips between St. Cloud and Crow Wing. In 1856, the county seat moved to Watab, then returned to Sauk Rapids in 1859. A new courthouse was built, but in 1897 the seat moved to Foley where it currently resides. In 1917 the courthouse burned down. Sauk Rapids was one of the most important cities in Minnesota until 1886, when, on April 14 at approximately 4:00 p.m., a tornado struck the town. The twister swept through the heart of the city, destroying all of the stores. In Sauk Rapids alone, 44 people were killed and several hundred were wounded. The event was a great setback for the city, and though it has rebuilt since then it never regained its former prominence in statewide affairs. In recent years, the downtown area of Sauk Rapids has gone through substantial changes due to the construction of the New Sauk Rapids Bridge. This was primarily because the new bridge links to 2nd Street rather than 1st Street, as the original Sauk Rapids Bridge did. Also the intersection of Benton Drive and 2nd street was adjusted so the new bridge would extend over the railroad tracks and land on Benton Drive. Several buildings had to be demolished during the construction process, which meant that some parts of downtown were rebuilt. In addition, some sidewalks were repaved with cobblestone and the medians were filled with granite blocks. Law and government Sauk Rapids' city council consists of a mayor and four City Council members elected at-large to represent the community and legislate citywide policy. Sauk Rapids' mayor is Kurt Hunstiger and its four council members are Steve Heinen, Nick Sauer, Jason Ellering, and Ellen Thronson. They possess the authority to pass and enforce ordinances, establish public and administrative policies, create advisory boards and commissions, and limit the number of garbage trucks traversing the city streets. The City Council also appoints a City Administrator who oversees the day-to-day operations of the city and implements the policies of the Council. City recreational facilities include 22 parks, nature preserves, paved walking paths, playgrounds, tennis courts, baseball and soccer fields, a golf course, public splash pad, and a wading pool. Schools Sauk Rapids has 5 schools present with 4 public and 1 private. The schools include Mississippi Heights Elementary, Pleasantview Elementary, Sauk Rapids-Rice Middle School, Sauk Rapids-Rice High School, and Petra Lutheran School. The mascot for Mississippi Heights Elementary, Pleasantview Elementary, Sauk Rapids-Rice Middle School, and Sauk Rapids-Rice High School is the Storm, a reference to the tornado of 1886.

It lies next to the California state line and City of South Lake Tahoe. The population was 842 at the 2010 census. The population swells considerably during the busy winter and summer seasons, due to the high number of hotel rooms and rental accommodations available. Attractions U.S. Route 50 in central Stateline, October 2015 Stateline is home to five open casinos, four of which qualify as resorts: MontBleu (formerly Caesar's), Harrah's Lake Tahoe, Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Lake Tahoe (formerly Horizon), and Harveys Lake Tahoe. Until its closure on April 14, 2020, the Lakeside Inn catered to locals and modest gamblers. Many of the hotels in the neighboring city of South Lake Tahoe, California, organize buses to take residents to the casinos in Stateline. Stateline and South Lake Tahoe are effectively a single settlement, with the state line intersecting with U.S. Route 50 immediately after the Harrah's and Harvey's casinos. As commercial gambling establishments are illegal in California unless built on Indian reservations, the casinos are extremely popular with California residents due to their strategic location right on the state line. Another well-known feature of Stateline is Kingsbury Grade, which runs up and over a mountain pass, rising from Lake Tahoe and dropping down to the Carson Valley on the other side. Most of Stateline's residential and seasonal accommodation, amenities and services are located on or near Kingsbury Grade. The route can be difficult in the winter months and snow chains are essential during this time. Larger vehicles are required to allow traffic to pass when five or more vehicles are queued behind them. Notable events * The Harvey's Resort Hotel bomb threat began on August 26, 1980 and continued for 2 days. The event ended when the bomb was inadvertently detonated during an attempt to disarm it. As a result, the north side of the building was destroyed. * On the afternoon of January 5, 1998, the Heavenly Ski Resort was the scene of the death of musician and politician Sonny Bono. While skiing alone, Bono struck a tree on \\"Orion\\", an intermediate slope high on Heavenly's Nevada side, in Stateline. * The 2007 film Smokin' Aces was filmed at the Horizon and MontBleu Resort Casino & Spa featuring many views of the shore from Aces' suite at the casino. History Most of the town and surrounding land has been maintained by the heirs of the historic Friday's Station of the Pony Express; it is leased to the casinos. The duplex naming of the community originated in part because of an interstate border dispute, resulting from differences in several boundary surveys. The erroneous 1872 Von Schmidt survey of the California-Nevada boundary found the stateline crossing U.S. 50 on the west edge of present-day Applebee's, and the east edge of the Ashley Marcus Gallery in Tahoe Crescent V Shopping Center in California. The community of Stateline, California, contended to be in Nevada, emerged just east to benefit from Nevada law‚Äîincluding tax-free status and later gambling which was legalized in 1931. However, an 1893 United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (C.G.S.) placed the border several thousand feet east of 1872 Von Schmidt line, creating a discrepancy which left the community in legal jeopardy. The Stateline Country Club operated in the 1930s. By the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, gambling development moved east across the 1893 C.G.S. line to a new adjacent community of Edgewood, NV. After a 1980 US Supreme Court ruling, the east- migrated gambling community of Egewood formally regained its name Stateline, this time in NV.; the California portion which had been contested by Nevada was dissolved into the city of South Lake Tahoe. The currently accepted interstate border is marked by the 1893 US CGS Federal Survey Monuments No. 1, No. 2, and No.3. Geography Stateline is located at (38.970512, ‚àí119.945714). It lies on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe to the east of the California-Nevada state line from which it takes its name, and the city of South Lake Tahoe, California.

It is home to Great Basin College, as well as to the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office serving most of northern and central Nevada. History Elko was settled with the coming of the railroad, which still runs past downtown Elko near the Humboldt River. Though Elko lies along the route of the historic California Trail, it was first inhabited only in 1868, when it was at the east end of the railroad tracks built by the Central Pacific Railroad (the portion of the First Transcontinental Railroad built from California to Utah). When the railroad crews moved on, Elko remained, serving as a center for ranching, mining, rail freight and general supplies. View southwest along the Humboldt River from the 9th Street Footbridge in downtown Elko Elko is said to have been named by Charles Crocker, a superintendent of the Central Pacific Railroad. He was especially fond of animal names and added the letter \\"o\\" to Elk. There is no definitive evidence of this naming history, but it has become the widely accepted version. The first Elko County Courthouse was built in 1869. Elko was officially incorporated as a city in 1917. In 1925, the Kelly Act (also known as the Airmail Act of 1925) authorized the United States Postal Service to contract with private airlines for the feeder routes that fed the main transcontinental route. The first commercial airmail flight in the United States was on the Airmail Route #5 from Pasco, Washington, to what would become Elko Regional Airport on April 6, 1926. The flight was piloted by Leon D. Cuddeback and included a brief stop in Boise, Idaho, to pick up more mail. The 1910 replacement for the original courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The U.S. Post Office-Elko Main, built in 1933, is also listed.

Economy Goldstrike mine, a large gold mine near Elko Elko's economy is based heavily on gold mining, with ranching and tourism providing additional jobs. The city is considered the capital of Nevada's goldbelt. The state of Nevada produces more gold than all but four countries, and most of the gold from Nevada is mined near Elko. This has caused the town to have a boom and bust economy consistent with the rises and declines in the price of gold. The town is surrounded by hundreds of abandoned mining camps, and viewing them is a popular local activity. A gold boom in the 1980s that ended in a bust in the late 1990s left the town with large numbers of abandoned homes and left the local governments struggling to survive on reduced tax revenues. With a new gold boom starting in 2009, city officials have been reluctant to hire new employees and have decided to build a reserve in the city budget to prepare for the next bust. Elko has struggled to bring in other industries, mostly because of its isolation and the surrounding harsh desert environment. Hunter S.

The population was 953 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Elko Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is the primary town of the federally recognized Shoshone-Paiute tribe's Duck Valley Indian Reservation, which covers portions of northern Nevada and southern Idaho, and the majority of its population are Native American. Owyhee, along with the rest of Nevada except for the city of West Wendover, is legally in the Pacific Time Zone. But, along with other Idaho border towns such as Jackpot, Mountain City and Jarbidge, it unofficially observes the Mountain Time Zone as it has closer proximity to and greater connections with towns in southern Idaho.  History  The Tribes once freely occupied the land in the tri-state area of what is now Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon. This changed with the coming of migrants from the eastern United States and Europe, especially after the mid-19th century. Land and resources were wrestled away from the Shoshone and Paiute. The tribes made treaties with the United States, of which some were ratified by the Senate and others not. The chiefs signed all the treaties in good faith and for the survival of their peoples. Descendants of the Western Shoshone and the Northern Paiute occupy the Duck Valley Indian Reservation of Idaho and Nevada. Various bands of the two closely related tribes have jointly used the area for seasonal hunting and gathering from time immemorial. On April 16, 1877, United States President Rutherford B. Hayes established the reservation for the Western Shoshone. In the early days of the Duck Valley reservation, the people built and lived in their traditional earthen, willow and sagebrush huts. Bands of Western Shoshone occupied and revolved on and off the reservation, depending on their survival needs and because of the unfulfilled promises of food and supplies from the federal government. Some bands adapted as best they could. Others did not want to leave their homelands and campsites which were located off the reservation. The Northern Paiute bands became allied with their kin, the Bannock, in the Bannock War of 1878. After their defeat by the United States, survivors were relocated as prisoners to an Indian reservation in Yakima, Washington. Upon their release, the survivors were returned to their homelands, and the Western Shoshone reservation was expanded for their use in 1886. In 1884, local settlers tried to get the Western Shoshone removed to the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho, in order to open up Duck Valley lands for non-Indian homesteads, but the chiefs successfully resisted this effort. The tribal bands located at Duck Valley were supervised by the Indian Agent and later Indian Police. Farming and ranching became the mainstay for the people. From 1884 through 1911 an Indian boarding school operated on the reservation. Thereafter three day schools were operated in three separate locations on the reservation. In Owyhee, the Swayne School was built. In 1931, during the Great Depression, the day schools were closed, and all students were sent to the Swayne School. Students of the higher grades were sent off reservation to boarding schools until 1946, That year high school classes were finally added to the reservation school. In 1956 the reservation school system was consolidated into the Elko County School District of Nevada and today is known as the Owyhee Combined Schools (K-12). Recently, a community education center was placed in Owyhee for GED and higher education courses. The first full-time physician was assigned to Duck Valley in 1882. By 1897 a small one-room infirmary hospital was built. It was replaced by 1920 with a structure which had two seven-bed wards. The Shoshone and Paiute united at Duck Valley under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and formed a tribal government through adopting a constitution and bylaws for elected government in 1936. In July 1937 the native stone hospital was completed with a 20-bed ward, X-ray and laboratory facilities. The native stone hospital was closed in 1976 when the modern Owyhee Community Health Facility was completed. Government The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley are governed by the Business Council. The Business Council is composed of a chairman, vice-chairman and five council members, all of whom are elected to serve three-year terms. The Business Council directs the tribal government. The chairman manages the operations of tribal government. There are four divisions of tribal administration: Health & Human Services, Judicial Services, Tribal Programs and Support Services. Farming and ranching are still mainstays for Duck Valley and is reflected in the of lands. The Duck Valley Reservation is composed of held in trust by the United States government for the use and occupancy of the Shoshone-Paiute tribes. Included in the total acreage of the reservation are of wetlands. Wild Horse Reservoir was constructed in 1936 for the Duck Valley Irrigation Project. Tribal membership is more than 2,000, with approximately 1,700 living on the reservation. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley continue to live within the historic territories of their ancestors.

The population was 4,410 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Elko micropolitan area. West Wendover is located on the eastern border of Nevada and the western edge of the Great Salt Lake Desert and is contiguous with Wendover, Utah, with which it is sometimes confused. Interstate 80 runs just north of the cities, while Interstate 80 Business (Wendover Boulevard) runs through the two cities. History USAAF Monument in West Wendover West Wendover began to develop in the 1930s and 1940s with the introduction of legalized gambling in the State of Nevada. William \\"Bill\\" Smith founded a small cobblestone service station that provided a needed rest to weary travelers crossing the desert terrain of western Utah and eastern Nevada. Today this facility is known as the Wendover Nugget. It held the record as the oldest continually operated gaming license for a casino in the State of Nevada for over 66 years, until December 2001, when the former State Line Casino and Hotel came under new ownership. Through the 1970s and 1980s, West Wendover began to emerge as a destination resort. Additional business arrived constructing more casinos, hotels and other service establishments as well as recreational venues such as the Toana Vista Golf Course. As growth continued to spiral up, the citizens of West Wendover, Nevada, then a township of Elko County, elected to incorporate under self- rule. On July 1, 1991, the city of West Wendover, Nevada, came into existence. Amber S Holt named the city seal of West Wendover encouraging people to \\"Come Grow With Us.\\" In October 1999, the U.S. Department of Transportation moved West Wendover out of the Pacific Time Zone due to the strong economic ties between West Wendover and neighboring Utah. This made the city of West Wendover the only portion of Nevada legally in the Mountain Time Zone. The communities of Jackpot, Jarbidge, Mountain City, and Owyhee in northern Elko County also observe Mountain Time, but only on an unofficial basis. West Wendover has thrived under a lucrative gambling industry in Nevada, which has generated tax revenue for city services and better schools. Residents in both cities have voted to annex Wendover into Nevada, saying they are one community that has been divided for too long. Some politicians in both the State of Utah and the State of Nevada have endorsed the idea, but the U.S. House of Representatives resolution permitting Wendover to leave Utah and join Nevada was stalled in the U.S. Senate in 2002 and did not become law. However, the politicians in Wendover, Utah, placed a permanent halt to the annexation process through a vote on November 15, 2006. The motion made was to halt the annexation process. The vote was a tie, with two Council Members voting to halt the process and two Council Members supporting the continuation of the process. The tie vote was broken up by a vote of Wendover, Utah, Mayor Brett Shelton who voted to discontinue the annexation process. Previously, West Wendover had decided to halt any further work after Wendover, Utah, indicated they were going to discuss and make a decision as to whether or not they would proceed. Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution requires that any change in state boundaries be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by the two state legislatures.

McDermitt's economy has historically been based on mining, ranching, and farming. The last mining operation closed in 1990, resulting in a steady decline in population. As of the 2010 census, the combined population was 513. Seventy-five percent of the residents were American Indian, predominantly Northern Paiute of the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation, whose members include Shoshone people. History The community, originally called Dugout, was named after Fort McDermit. It was named after Lt. Col. Charles McDermit, commander of the Military District of Nevada, who was killed by Indians in a skirmish in the area in 1865. It is not known why there is a discrepancy in the spelling. Fort McDermit, which was outside the current township, was originally established to protect the stagecoach route from Virginia City through Winnemucca to Silver City, Idaho Territory. The stage road was the military's most important transportation route in southeast Oregon. The township of Dugout was established as support for Fort McDermit. Geography and climate The community is on U.S. Highway 95, north of Winnemucca. The elevation of McDermitt is above sea level. McDermitt is in the Oregon High Desert with a desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification 'BSk'), averaging of rain annually with hot, dry summers and cold winters. Most precipitation (47%) occurs from March through June. About 23% occurs from September through November, and 25% from December through February, much as snow. The McDermitt area boasts the longest climatic record in Nevada, with data beginning in 1866. The earliest Nevada climate stations were at Army posts. The U.S. Army Signal Corps was responsible for weather duty in the late 19th century and established the National Weather Service in 1870.

Economy Desert Inn Casino McDermitt's economy has historically been based on mining, ranching and farming. In the period 1917 to 1989 it was home to four nationally significant mercury mines in the McDermitt CalderaBretz, Opalite, Cordero and McDermittwhich from 1933 to 1989 were the largest producers in North America. In 1985 of the 16,530 flasks of mercury (each containing produced in the US, 16,337 came from the McDermitt Mine. The closure of mercury mining in 1990 resulted in a significant decline in population. Significant gold mines in the nearby Santa Rosa Mountains were the National that produced in excess of , and the Buckskin National that produced of gold and of silver over the period 1906‚Äì1941. Current development activities that may result in renewed mining are at Cordero (gold and silver), Cordero (gallium), Buckskin-National (gold- silver), Aurora (uranium) and Disaster Peak (gold). The largest employers in McDermitt are the Say When Bar, Restaurant & Casino and the McDermitt Combined School.

History Gold and copper mines in the Battle Mountain Mining District. As of 2019, the mines are operated by Newmont Goldcorp as the Phoenix Mine. The Battle Mountain area was home to the Northern Paiute and Shoshone peoples. The area was noted by fur trappers in the 1820s and '30s. It served as a waypoint for westward-bound travel on the Emigrant Trail along the Humboldt River by 1845. According to local legends the name stems from confrontations between Native Americans and early settlers during the 1850s and '60s.Battle Mountain Community, Lander County Online Government When copper ore was discovered in 1866 and mining began, the Central Pacific Railroad started a station to support the mining activity. In 1870 the railroad moved the Argenta station to Battle Mountain and established a townsite to serve the Battle Mountain copper and gold mining district.About Battle Mountain In 1874, the Nevada Legislature overrode the governor's veto and approved a railroad from Austin to Battle Mountain. The Nevada Central Railroad from Battle Mountain to Austin was completed in 1880. The rail line was constructed to connect the silver mines around Austin to the Central Pacific line at Battle Mountain. The rail line served the Austin area until it was abandoned in 1938.Michael Brown, Nevada Central Narrow Gauge, in Narrow Gauge and Short Lines Railroads of the West Ulysses S. Grant spoke in the town in 1879 during his western speaking tour. President Woodrow Wilson established Battle Mountain Indian Colony by executive order (Lander) in 1917. In 1919, Nevada's Red Scare Miners held a ten-day strike at the Battle Mountain Copper Mines. In a 1979 ruling, the Nevada Supreme Court moved the Lander County seat to Battle Mountain.

Geology Copper mining started in 1866 and the Copper Canyon Mine operated from 1917 until 1955. The Tomboy-Minnie ore deposits were developed after the depletion of the West ore body, which was developed after the depletion of the East ore body. Open-pit mining started in 1967. Placer gold was discovered in 1912. Mining switched from the copper-gold-silver ores to gold-silver ores in 1979. The Fortitude gold-silver skarn body was discovered in 1981. The Surprise gold deposit was discovered in 1986. The economic geologic zone is primarily in the Antler Sequence, consisting of the Middle Pennsylvanian Battle Formation, the Pennsylvanian to Permian Antler Peak Limestone, and the Permian Edna Mountain Formation. These Paleozoic rocks were intruded in the Tertiary by a granodiorite porphyry which generated the ore bodies as zones of disseminated sulfide minerals. These zones include copper-gold-silver next to the granodiorite, followed by a gold-silver zone, then a lead-zinc-silver zone.

The population was 8,964 at the 2010 census. Dayton is the first Nevada settlement and home to the oldest hotel in Nevada. The micronation of Molossia is located in Dayton. History The Carson River in Dayton Dayton is at the western end of the Twenty-Six Mile Desert at a bend in the Carson River. Immigrants stopping there for water would decide whether to follow the river south or continue west, giving the location its first name, Ponderers Rest. In 1849, Abner Blackburn, while heading for California, discovered a gold nugget in nearby Gold Creek, a tributary of the Carson River. By 1850, placer miners settled at the mouth of Gold Ca√±on, working sand bars deposited over the millennia along the path of the creek. At first the settlement was just called \\"Gold Ca√±on\\" or \\"Gold Ca√±on Flat\\". Throughout the 1850s, Dayton served as the commercial hub for miners working in the canyon. In 1857 many Chinese miners came to the area to avoid mining taxes directed at the Chinese in California. With the 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode, newly founded Gold Hill and Virginia City, to the north, assumed prominence and most miners headed up the ca√±on. By 1860 the town was primarily occupied by Chinese miners and it was called \\"China Town\\" in the U.S. census of that year. However, soon people began to realize there was more profit in providing milling, goods, and services to the miners and thus came or returned to the area.http://www.daytonnvhistory.org/history Dayton courthouse, built in 1864 In 1861, the town officially adopted the name \\"Dayton\\", after John Day, a local surveyor who was later elected Surveyor General of Nevada in 1868, 1870, and 1874. On November 29, 1861, Dayton became the governmental seat for Lyon County. Because of the availability of water from the Carson River, it soon became the first major milling center of the Comstock, and grew rapidly‚Äîfrom 78 residents in 1860 to 2,500 in 1865. Its 1864 courthouse was one of the first in Nevada. Union Hotel, Dayton, built in the early 1870s In 1866 and 1870 devastating \\"Great Fires\\" in Dayton greatly reduced the size of the town. The 1869 opening of the Virginia & Truckee Railroad shifted ore processing upstream to the Carson River Canyon, but Dayton continued to serve as a lesser center of commerce and government. Nonetheless, in the 1870s it was a much quieter, less prosperous town. The coming of the Carson & Colorado Railroad in 1881 brought back some prosperity to Dayton, but the population nonetheless hovered around 500 residents until after World War I. In 1909, fire destroyed the Lyon County Courthouse. Residents of the growing agricultural community of Yerington to the south called for a shift of the Lyon County seat, which occurred in 1911, leaving Dayton with a shrinking economy and population. By the 1920s, the Lincoln Highway was bringing some tourists to Dayton, but the town remained a quiet reminder of a time when Nevada's gold and silver strikes captured national attention. It did not surpass its 1865 peak population of 2,500 until 1930. In 1961, Dayton won fame as a setting for John Huston's film, The Misfits, the last movie appearances of Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. Beginning in the 1990s, Dayton experienced phenomenal growth as residential development expanded on the east side of the Carson River. The historic part of Dayton is within the Comstock Historic District, featuring a small but impressive main street, the monumental Odeon Hall, and a charming local museum located in an 1865 schoolhouse‚Äîthe oldest in Nevada in its original location. Dayton claims the designation of Nevada's oldest settlement, a title disputed by the residents of Genoa. Dayton points to the fact that when the wagon train of pioneer Lucena Parsons stayed at the mouth of Gold Ca√±on (today's Dayton) for several weeks waiting for the snow to leave the Sierra Nevada, she recorded in her journal that Colonel Reese and his party passed along the Carson River as they headed for the Sierra foothills to establish Mormon Station (today's Genoa). She had noted also that upon the wagon train's arrival about three weeks earlier, more than 200 miners were working the ca√±on. Today's residents of Genoa point to the region's first post office and several other aspects of town government, noting that their community deserves the title of \\"Nevada's first town\\", a claim that Dayton residents do not care enough to dispute. Dayton is listed as Nevada Historical Marker 7. Geography Dayton is located in western Lyon County at (39.251707, -119.561943).

History Fernley schoolhouse Fernley, established in 1904, developed as primarily an agricultural and ranching community in proximity to Reno. It is unknown why the name \\"Fernley\\" was applied to this community. Analysis of Fernley's name by Guy Rocha, Nevada State Archivist ‚Äì as published on Official city website, snapshot 11/11/2014 Much of the farmland in the Fernley area was developed through the Newlands Irrigation Project, which was a result of the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902. The project established an irrigation system that delivers water to an area stretching from Derby Dam, along the Truckee River, to the Lahontan Reservoir near Fallon, Nevada. Construction and expansion of the system took place from the inception through the 1960s. Many of the concrete irrigation headgates, still in use today, are embossed with the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) stamp and date of construction. In addition to the irrigation system in the Fernley area, a drainage system was also constructed to carry away excess water and mineral salts from the farmlands. This system consists of channels ( deep) dug adjacent to fields; it eventually terminates in the sink northeast of Fernley. The irrigation system is administered and maintained through the Truckee‚ÄìCarson Irrigation District. Until 1904, there was no place named \\"Fernley\\" in the area. It was not until the Southern Pacific Railroad realigned its route through northwestern Nevada that the Fernley siding was created. Fernley first shows up as a station stop, but with no other services, on Southern Pacific employee timetables beginning with the June 19, 1904, edition (SP Salt Lake Division ETT No. 1). By September 3, 1905, Fernley is listed with a day and night telegraph office and wye facilities. The descendants of the telegrapher James A. Galbraith, who arrived with his family in 1906, still reside in the region. In the meantime, a community emerged and took the name Fernley. The general area was part of the fledgling Truckee-Carson Reclamation Project created by Congress in 1902 and later named the Canal District because of the newly created Truckee Canal connecting the Truckee River to the Lahontan Reservoir. Workers and settlers found their way to the western edge of the first federal reclamation project. On June 9, 1904, the Lyon County Commissioners created the Canal Township and appointed a constable, Robert A. Benson, and a justice of the peace, Edgar I. Parker, both men filing for homesteads in late 1903, according to records housed at the National Archives. In 1907 more settlers arrived and established homesteads. On April 21, 1908, the Fernley post office opened. A public school also began operating in the 1908‚Äì1909 school year. According to the 1910 U.S. Census, 159 people lived in the Fernley area. Some were appointed postmaster, and others elected to the school board, the office of the Justice of the Peace, and the State Assembly. The Southern Pacific Railroad completed the Fernley and Lassen Railway in 1914, and a suitable depot was constructed in Fernley. Residents welcomed the completion of the transcontinental Lincoln/Victory Highways through town in the 1920s. The town grew slowly & unpredictably at first. In 1960, only 654 people were enumerated in the U.S. Census. However, the population had more than doubled by 1970 with the construction of Interstate 80 and the Nevada Cement Company opening its operation in 1963. By 1980, the population had more than doubled again. By the 1990s, the population had reached 5,164, and in 2000 the census counted 8,543 residents. The population more than doubled yet again over the next decade, reaching 19,368 by the 2010 census. =Recent history= In 1965, the Nevada Cement CompanyUntitled Document started operation in a new plant built on the north side of the city between Fernley and Wadsworth. This was the first significant non-agricultural/ranching business to come to Fernley, aside from the railroad. Primary employment in Fernley began a steady transition to an industrial and commuter base continuing to the present time. Beginning in the 1970s, parts of the formerly agricultural and ranching-based lands were transitioning to housing subdivisions to support the growing population, much of which was spilling over from rapid growth in the Reno-Sparks area. Close proximity to Interstate 80 and abundant land for housing made Fernley an attractive alternative to the increasingly congested and expensive Truckee Meadows housing market. Beginning near the established parts of the town, growth moved to the Fremont Street area in the mid to late 1970s, nearer farming areas in the 1980s, and has continued along the Farm District Road areas to the present. Numerous subdivisions now exist along the Farm District Road, including an 18-hole golf course and a new elementary school. In 1999, Amazon.com opened a order fulfillment center in the industrial park located in the northeast side of the city, following major initiatives and investments by investors from Seattle. Stanley Works had previously used the facility; Amazon.com redesigned the interior systems and greatly expanded the capacity in the years since. The investment has provided thousands of new jobs for the city and invigorated the economy in the metropolitan area. Since that time, more companies have opened facilities in the park, including Trex Inc., Allied Signal, UPS Worldwide Logistics (Honeywell), ARE Campers, Johns Manville, and Sherwin Williams Paint.Fernley, NV ‚Äì Official Website On July 1, 2001, the city of Fernley was incorporated.

During Beatty's first year, wagons pulled by teams of horses or mules hauled freight between the Bullfrog district (that included the towns of Rhyolite, Bullfrog, Gold Center, Transvaal, and Springdale) and the nearest railroad, in Las Vegas, and by the middle of 1905, about 1,500 horses were engaged in this business.McCracken, History, p. 52 In October 1906, the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad (LV&T;) began regular service to Beatty; in April 1907, the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad (BG) reached the community, and the Tonopah and Tidewater (T&T;) line added a third railroad in October 1907. The LV&T; ceased operations in 1918, the BG in 1928, and the T&T; in 1940. Until the railroads abandoned their lines, Beatty served as the railhead for many mines in the area, including a fluorspar mine on Bare Mountain, to the east.McCracken, History, pp. 62‚Äì70 Beatty's first newspaper was the Beatty Bullfrog Miner, which began publishing in 1905 and went out of business in 1909. The Rhyolite Herald was the region's most important paper, starting in 1905 and reaching a circulation of 10,000 by 1909. It ceased publication in 1912, and the Beatty area had no newspaper from then until 1947. The Beatty Bulletin, a supplement to the Goldfield News, was published from then through 1956.McCracken, History, pp. 49‚Äì51 Beatty's population grew slowly in the first half of the 20th century, rising from 169 in 1929 to 485 in 1950.McCracken, History, pp. 102‚Äì03 The first reliable electric company in the community, Amargosa Power Company, began supplying electricity in about 1940. Phone service arrived during World War II, and the town installed a community-wide sewer system in the 1970s.McCracken, History, pp. 92‚Äì93 When a new mine opened west of Beatty in 1988, the population briefly surged from about 1,000 to between 1,500 and 2,000 by the end of 1990. Since the mine's closing in 1998, the population has fallen again to near its former level. Geography and climate The Amargosa River flows through Beatty. Beatty lies along U.S. Route 95 between Tonopah, about to the north, and Las Vegas, about to the southeast. State Route 374 connects Beatty to Death Valley National Park, about to the west. Yucca Mountain and the Nevada Test Site are about to the east. The most densely populated part of the census-designated place (CDP) of Beatty is at (36.909337, ‚àí116.754531), although the CDP extends well beyond this urban center. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. The most populated area lies at above sea level between Beatty Mountain and Bare Mountain to the east and the Bullfrog Hills to the west. The Amargosa River, an intermittent river that ends in Death Valley, flows on the surface through part of the CDP but has not been counted as water in the Census Bureau statistics. Nevada's main climatic features are bright sunshine, low annual precipitation, heavy snowfall in the higher mountains, clean, dry air, and large daily temperature ranges. Strong surface heating occurs by day and rapid cooling by night, and usually even the hottest days have cool nights. The average percentage of possible sunshine in southern Nevada is more than 80 percent. Sunshine and low humidity in this region account for an average evaporation, as measured in evaporation pans, of more than of water a year. Beatty receives only of precipitation a year. Precipitation of at least falls on an average of 21 days annually. The wettest year was 1941 with and driest year was 1953 with . The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in December to in July. On average, there are 26 days of + highs, 97 days of +, and 38 days where the high remains at or below ; the average window for freezing temperatures is November 2 to April 6. Snow is uncommon and measurable (‚â•) amounts occur in less than 60 of seasons. The highest recorded temperature was on June 11, 1961, and the lowest was on February 2, 1933.

Economy Downtown Beatty in 2012 Early businesses in Beatty included the Montgomery Hotel, built by a mine owner in 1905, and freight businesses first centered on horse-drawn wagons and later on railroads serving the mining towns in the Bullfrog district.McCracken, History, pp. 52‚Äì59 Beatty became the economic center for a large sparsely populated region. Aside from mining, other activities sustaining the community during the 1920s and 1930s included retail sales, gas and oil distribution, construction of Scotty's Castle, and the production and sale of illegal alcohol during Prohibition.McCracken, History, p. 74 Nevada's legalization of gambling in 1931, the establishment of Death Valley National Monument in 1933, and the rise of Las Vegas as an entertainment center, brought visitors to Beatty, which became increasingly tourist-oriented.McCracken, History, pp. 101‚Äì02 As underground mining declined in the region, federal defense spending, starting with the Nellis Air Force Range in 1940 and the Nevada Test Site in 1950, also contributed to the local economy. However, in 1988, an open-pit mine and mill began operations about west of Beatty along State Route 374. Barrick Gold acquired the mine in 1994 and continued to extract and process ore at what became known as the Barrick Bullfrog Mine. At its peak, the mine employed 540 workers, many of whom lived in Beatty.McCracken, History, pp. 155‚Äì57 The mine closed in 1998. In 2004, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) named the closed Barrick Bullfrog mine site as one of six slated for pilot reclamation projects under the national Brownfields Mine-Scarred Land Initiative. A local group, the Beatty Economic Development Corporation (BEDC), in discussions with the EPA, suggested solar-power generation as a potential use for the site. Barrick Gold later transferred of its land to Beatty. In February 2009, the New York Times published a Greenwire article suggesting that part of the economic stimulus money from the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act might finance the Beatty project. \\"Studies show that the Beatty area has some of the best solar energy potential in the United States, as well as a high potential for wind-power generation,\\" the Greenwire story said. The Beatty Chamber of Commerce web site describes the community as the Gateway to Death Valley, a small rural locality that has \\"everything the desert visitor needs\\" including motels and recreational vehicle (RV) sites. Aside from tourism, businesses contributing to the local economy include mining, retail trade, public administration and gambling. Burro races From 1961 until 1972 the local Lions Club held annual burro races that drew competitors from the United States, Canada, and as far away as Iran. National attention was brought to the race when Reg Potterton wrote a feature article about the 1971 race for Playboy magazine. The story, appearing in the May 1972 issue, featured stories about the town, the contestants, and the tourists who attended. Eventually the races were discontinued after organizers decided that the visitors they attracted were not good for Beatty's image. Infrastructure and culture Beatty Public Library The community is home to the Beatty Museum and Historical Society. The ghost town of Rhyolite and the Goldwell Open Air Museum, a sculpture park, are about to the west. Bailey's Hot Springs and bathhouses are about north of Beatty in the Oasis Valley. In addition to highways, Beatty has a general aviation airfield, Beatty Airport, about south of downtown. Beatty Medical Center, which opened in 1977, provides family medicine and other services. The Beatty Library is the only library in Nevada that is housed in a geodesic dome. Beatty's combined elementary and middle schools, serving kindergarten through eighth grade, and Beatty High School, grades 9‚Äì12, are part of the Nye County School District. The Beatty Water and Sanitation District supplies drinking water from three wells to the town residents and treats the community's wastewater. References Works cited * Lingenfelter, Richard E.

The population was 269 at the 2010 census and it is the northernmost community of Greater Las Vegas. History Gabbs was founded circa December 1941 as a company town for Basic Magnesium, Inc. (BMI), which operated a magnesium production plant in the area. The town grew out of an earlier mining camp named Brucite (after the magnesium oxide brucite that occurred locally), and took the name of the surrounding Gabbs Valley, itself named after paleontologist William Gabb (who had studied fossil specimens from the area). World War II demand for magnesium fueled the plant's expansion under the direction of the War Production Board, and policing, a jail, and a school district were established during 1942. Gabbs became a township in June 1943, with a population of 426. Settlements at North Gabbs, South Gabbs, and Tent City (which later largely merged into North Gabbs) were served by a library, city hall, parks, and tennis courts, and a succession of local newspapers. The city incorporated on March 29, 1955.Hall, Shawn Preserving the Glory Days: Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of Nye County, Nevada. University of Nevada Press, 1999, p.16 Mine entrance in Gabbs In September 1944 the original magnesium plant was closed, having produced enough ore to meet targets for the projected duration of the war. The local population initially fell, but revived when a new plant administered by Basic Refractories, Inc., producing magnesium for the private sector, was opened in 1955. The town's population climbed to 796 by 1960. In 1982 BRI laid off half its 350 workers, prompting the town's population to decline once more. An influx of workers to a gold mine in nearby Paradise Peak briefly expanded the population again during the 1980s and 1990s, but this plant too closed in 1994, and in 2001 Gabbs lost its incorporated status.Marschall, Peter, \\"Gabbs\\", in the Online Nevada Encyclopedia.

History Tonopah in 1913 Mizpah mine The American community began circa 1900 with the discovery of silver-rich ore by prospector Jim Butler. The legendary tale of discovery says that he went looking for a burro that had wandered off during the night and sought shelter near a rock outcropping. When Butler discovered the animal the next morning, he picked up a rock to throw at it in frustration, noticing that the rock was unusually heavy. He had stumbled upon the second-richest silver strike in Nevada history. Men of wealth and power entered the region to consolidate the mines and reinvest their profits into the infrastructure of the town of Tonopah. George Wingfield, a 24-year-old poker player when he arrived in Tonopah, played poker and dealt faro in the town saloons. Once he had a small bankroll, he talked Jack Carey, owner of the Tonopah Club, into taking him in as a partner and to file for a gaming license. In 1903, miners rioted against Chinese workers in Tonopah. This resulted in China enforcing a boycott in China of U.S. imported goods. By 1904, after investing his winnings in the Boston-Tonopah Mining Company, Wingfield was worth $2 million. When old friend George S. Nixon, a banker, arrived in town, Wingfield invested in his Nye County Bank. They grub-staked (provided with food, supplies and tools in an exchange for a percentage of mine yield) miners with friend Nick Abelman, and bought existing mines. By the time the partners moved to Goldfield, Nevada and made their Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company a public corporation in 1906, Nixon and Wingfield were worth more than $30 million. Tonopah (Nevada) Meteorite. Weight 3,275 lbs. Wingfield believed that the end of the gold and silver mining production was coming and took his bankroll to Reno, where he invested heavily in real estate and casinos. Real estate and gaming became big business throughout Central Nevada. By 1910, gold production was falling and by 1920, the town of Tonopah had less than half the population it had fifteen years earlier. Small mining ventures continued to provide income for local miners and the small town struggled on. Located about halfway between Reno and Las Vegas, it has supported travelers as a stopover and rest spot on a lonely highway. Today the Tonopah Station has slots and the Banc Club also offers some gaming. Also in Nye County is the Yomba Band of the Yomba Shoshone Tribe of the Yomba Reservation, a federally recognized band of Western Shoshone people. The Western Shoshone dominated most of Nevada at the time of American settlement in the 1860s. Since the late 20th century, Tonopah has relied on the nearby military Tonopah Test Range as its main source of employment. The military has used the range and surrounding areas as a nuclear bomb test site, a bombing range, and as a base of operations for the development of the F-117 Nighthawk. In 2014, California-based solar energy company SolarReserve completed construction on a $980 million advanced solar energy project near Tonopah. The Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project uses liquid sodium as a heat transfer medium for its solar energy storage technology. The plant began producing power in November 2015. On May 15, 2020, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck west of Tonopah, followed by a series of aftershocks, the largest of which was a magnitude 5.1. However, no injuries were reported. It was the largest earthquake in Nevada since 1954. Etymology and pronunciation The founder, Jim Butler, named the settlement, from what is thought to be a Shoshoni language word, pronounced \\"TOE-nuh-pah.\\" Although the town previously had a variety of names, including Butler City, Jim Butler's name has survived. According to local history, the name is said to mean \\"hidden spring\\". Linguistically, the name derives from either Shoshone to-nuv (greasewood), or Northern Paiute to-nav (greasewood), and pa, meaning water in both dialects. Climate Tonopah has an arid, cold desert climate with cool winters and hot summers. Due to Tonopah‚Äôs aridity and high altitude, daily temperature ranges are quite large. Nights are cool, even in summer. There are an average of 50.3 afternoons with highs at or above , 157.8 mornings with lows of or lower, 7.6 afternoons where the high does not top freezing and 1.7 mornings with lows below . The record high temperature in Tonopah was on July 18, 1960, and the record low on January 24, 1937 and January 23, 1962. There are an average of 38 days with measurable precipitation. The wettest calendar year was 1946 with and the driest 1927 with . The most precipitation in one month was in November 1946. The most precipitation in 24 hours was on August 17, 1977.

Transportation During the silver bonanza of the first decade of the 20th century, the need in the precious- metal fields for freight service led to construction of a network of local railroad lines across the Nevada desert to Tonopah. Examples include the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad, the Tonopah and Goldfield Railroad, and the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad. Coal was hauled to the silver mines to power mine operations and also the stamp mills built in and around Tonopah to break apart the hard-rock ore for milling and refining. As the railroad lines were reduced with the decline of mining and restructuring of railroads in the late 20th century, 18-wheelers became the dominant method of moving freight. Tonopah took on a new identity as an extreme freight destination. The chorus of the song \\"Willin'\\" by Lowell George of Little Feat on the albums Little Feat, Sailin' Shoes, and Waiting for Columbus refers to Tonopah, Nevada: In the early 21st century, Tonopah is served by two U.S. Highways, Routes 6 and 95. There is no rail service. General aviation facilities are located at nearby Tonopah Airport. The nearest airport with scheduled passenger service is Mammoth Yosemite Airport, about away. The nearest major airports are McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, and Reno‚ÄìTahoe International Airport in Reno, each more than away. Daily bus service between Las Vegas, Tonopah, and Reno was provided by Silverado Stages. However, Silverado Stages ceased operations in December 2018, having declared bankruptcy.

Formerly a stop for settlers on their way to California and later a train depot, the town's economy remains based on farming, mining and increasingly on tourism. History The area in which the township of Lovelock was to be established first came to prominence as a midpoint on the Humboldt Trail to California. According to an 1849 description of what were then called the Big Meadows, \\"This marsh for three miles is certainly the liveliest place that one could witness in a lifetime.

Toll, A brief Description & History of Lovelock, Nevada, available online A few settlers stopped there to harvest the wild rye growing in the meadows and scythe the hay each fall, which they then sold. Arriving there from California in 1866, the English settler George Lovelock (1824‚Äì1907) bought the squatters' right for and received with it the oldest water rights on the Humboldt River. Although born in Wales, Lovelock was from a family of Wiltshire origin that is known to family historians as the Lyneham Line.Sue Lovelock, From Wiltshire to Nevada ‚Äì tracing the Lovelock connection, Lovelock Lines 4, January 2006 pp.3-5 His brother Daniel moved to Australia‚Äîand one of Daniel's sons to New Zealand‚Äîso that the relations of the man after whom the Nevada town was named are now widely scattered.

George Lovelock provided for the site, so the depot was therefore named 'Lovelock's' after him and appears as such on old maps.An early example is on Mitchell's map of Nevada (1872) Thereafter he put his mining expertise to work and discovered many valuable lodes in the surrounding area, which contributed to enhanced railway traffic. He also acted as the town's first postmaster and invested in hotels. In particular he was the first proprietor of the Big Meadows Hotel on Main Street, adjacent to the train station and what was eventually the Greyhound Bus depot. By 1900, the town of Lovelock had a school, churches and a business district along what was then called Railway Street‚Äîlater renamed West Broadway.Thomas Wren, A History of the State of Nevada: Its Resources and People, Lewis Publishing Company 1904 available online Also included among the businesses were no less than three weekly newspapers: The Lovelock Tribune, which ran from May 1898 until February 1912; the short-lived Lovelock Standard (April‚ÄìSeptember 1900); and The Argus (May 1900-Jan 1905). In August 1908 the weekly Lovelock Review was founded, becoming Lovelock Review-Miner in January 1911 and remaining under that name to the present day.Richard E. Lingenfelter, Karen Rix Gash, The newspapers of Nevada: a history and bibliography, 1854-1979, University of Nevada 1984 pp.144-7 Lovelock was incorporated as a city in 1917 and in 1919 it was named the county seat when Pershing County was carved out of the southern part of Humboldt County. Its famous round Court House was built at the end of Main Street, on the site of a school, which was then relocated. While mining and agriculture acted as the commercial centre for the locality, the community thrived on the state speciality of gambling, with many casinos and three legalised brothels, although all of the latter are now closed. The town's centenary was celebrated in 1968 with a Frontier Days theme suggested by two of the founder's great-great granddaughters, Elaine Pommerening and Pat Rowe, who had only recently moved back to Lovelock. In 1983, old U.S. Route 40 through downtown was bypassed by Interstate 80, and in the early 1990s the rail depot closed. Since then it has promoted itself as a tourist attraction with its historic buildings and special events. There have been several mining booms in the neighboring mountains. These included intensive activity in the Rochester and Seven Troughs areas at the start of the 20th century and subsequent drilling with more advanced techniques later in Rochester. The Coeur Rochester mine began further open cast mining for silver and gold in 2011,Coeur.com test drilling for gold continues at Relief Canyon,Pershing Gold Co. and diatomite is dug at the Colado Mine.Mine data online Geography Lovelock lies in the Humboldt River Basin, very near the terminus of the river. Some 20 miles outside the town is the Lovelock Native Cave, a horseshoe-shaped cave of about and where Northern Paiute natives anciently deposited a number of duck decoys and other artifacts.\\"Lovelock Caves, Lovelock Nevada\\" NevadaBeautiful.com, Retrieved 14 February 2010. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. It has four differently designed welcome signs with pioneer and Wild West themes placed on its approach roads. At the southern end of town is the 20-acre reservation of the Lovelock Paiute Tribe, which has recently profited from a change in state law to open a marijuana dispensary there. Facebook.

Portuguese festival in May and what became the annual Frontier Days weekend in July. There are also hot air balloon races (Lovers Aloft, inaugurated in February 2004) and the Lovelock Street Fever car show, begun in June 2007. A major draw is the Lovers Lock Plaza in the shaded area at the back of the Court House where couples symbolise their love by attaching a padlock to an 'endless chain', a practice begun on Valentine's Day, 2005. The following year saw the construction of a dirt-racing track known as the Lovelock Speedway. Lovelock's heritage buildings include the wooden built Grace Methodist Church on the corner of Cornell Avenue and 8th Street, dating from 1886. It was destroyed by fire in 1922 and the tower was rebuilt without the original spire; in 1983 the church was badly damaged by another fire and was restored again. Marzen House Museum is another Victorian building, built in 1874. The Italianate farmhouse was transported from Big Meadow Ranch in the 1980s and has on its site an assay office, farm machinery sheds, and buildings housing vintage automobiles, while inside it contains 1800s furnishings and a museum, shedding light on the area's history.Online information The Longhorn Bar beside the tracks on West Broadway is one of the few remaining commercial buildings in typical Nevada style. Not far away is the railroad depot dating from 1880. In 1999 it was presented to the town by the Union Pacific Railroad to be restored and moved to another lot for use as an eatery. This was registered as a historic building in 2004. The Pershing County Courthouse was built in 1919. Pershing County officials approached Frederic Joseph DeLongchamps, by then the architect of six Nevada courthouses, and asked for a design that would be low in price but distinctive in appearance. As a solution, DeLongchamps designed a round courthouse, patterning it after Thomas Jefferson's library at the University of Virginia campus. The circle-over- hexagon design includes a circular interior hallway and a round courtroom decorated with Corinthian pilasters. A broad, sweeping concrete staircase leads to the main floor of the Beaux-Arts classical structure. Its entrance includes a pedimented portico supported by six Ionic columns. Doric pilasters separate the main story windows. Cream-colored brick and terracotta finish the exterior. A shallow dome crowns the roof and provides the courtroom with a dramatic, soaring ceiling.'Julie Nicoletta, Buildings of Nevada, Oxford University Press USA, 2000, Notable people *Alan Bible, lawyer and politician *Robert Heizer, archaeologist *Joseph Lang, US Boxing team in the Los Angeles (1932) Olympic Games *Adrian C.

It was founded in 1904, incorporated on March 15, 1905, and is located just east of Reno. The 2019 U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey population count was 105,006. It is the fifth most populous city in Nevada. It is named after the late Nevada Governor John Sparks, a member of the Silver Party. Sparks is located within the Reno‚ÄìSparks metropolitan area. History The area that is now Sparks was first inhabited by the Washoe people. Euro-American settlement began in the early 1850s, and the population density remained very low until 1904 when the Southern Pacific Railroad built a switch yard and maintenance sheds there, after moving the division point from Wadsworth. In 1902, The Southern Pacific purchased a large tract of swamp-like land near its newly built railyard, and gave everyone clear deed to a 50' x 140' lot for the grand sum of $1. They also offered to pick up and move ‚Äî free of charge ‚Äî every house in Wadsworth and reassemble it in this new town. As the population increased, a city was established, first called Harriman, after E.H. Harriman, president of the Southern Pacific, and then renamed Sparks, after John Sparks, then governor of Nevada. View of Sparks from an airplane departing from nearby Reno‚ÄìTahoe International Airport Sparks remained a small town until the 1950s, when economic growth in Reno triggered a housing boom north of the railroad in the area of Sparks. During the 1970s, the area south of the railroad started to fill up with warehouses and light industry. In 1984, the tower for the Nugget Casino Resort was finished, giving Sparks its first, and currently only, high-rise casino. In 1996, the redevelopment effort of the B Street business district across from the Nugget that started in the early 1980s took a step forward with the opening of a multi-screen movie complex and the construction of a plaza area. This area, now known as Victorian Square, is a pedestrian-friendly district that hosts many open-air events. Under direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a comprehensive dynamic water quality computer model, the DSSAM Model, was developed (Earth Metrics, 1987) to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and stormwater management decisions throughout the Truckee River basin; this model was used to develop a set of surface runoff stormwater management measures for Sparks in the 1980s.C.M.Hogan, Marc Papineau et al.

Sparks is connected directly to south Reno by the Southeast Connector. It is a northerly extension of Veterans Parkway to the Sparks Boulevard at Greg Street. It serves as an expressway, with only 2 signaled intersections along its 5.5 mile stretch (one at Pembroke Drive and one at Mira Loma Drive), and constitutes a major arterial connection between Reno and Sparks. It provides an alternative route to existing, overcrowded routes such as the US-395/I-580 freeway, Rock Boulevard, and McCarran Boulevard. Construction began in late 2013, and was completed in July 2018. Sparks also is gearing up for the record of decision on a major, $1.1 billion (estimated) arterial road project, one that will turn a large portion of Pyramid Highway through nearby Spanish Springs into a controlled access, high speed arterial road that connects directly with the US 395 freeway via a complex interchange at the current Parr Boulevard connection. This will directly connect Spanish Springs, a major population center (parts of which are annexed with the city of Sparks), located in the valley just north of Sparks, with the existing Reno/Sparks freeway system which consists currently of Interstate 80 and US 395. This project will also offer more direct freeway system and inter-valley connections to and from Sun Valley, another major population center of the Reno/Sparks metropolitan statistical area. Sun Valley is located just north of Reno and just west of Spanish Springs, and is home to just over 20,000 residents as of 2020.

The population was 61,567 at the 2010 census but has been growing rapidly since then, as 2019 US census estimates rank Maple Grove as Minnesota's eighth largest city with 72,622 residents. Maple Grove serves as the retail, cultural and medical center of the northwest region of the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area. One of the Twin Cities' largest shopping centers, The Shoppes at Arbor Lakes, is located in Maple Grove. Additionally, Maple Grove is also home to the Hindu Temple of Minnesota, which is the largest Hindu temple in the state. History Winnebago were the only inhabitants in the area of Maple Grove until 1851 when Louis Gervais arrived and settled. Four years later, in 1855, city growth included a church, town hall and many homes. The Pierre Bottineau House was the first wood frame house built in Maple Grove Township in 1854. The house has been moved from its original location and is currently located in the Elm Creek Park Reserve. The city was known for its large stands of maple trees and was, therefore, a significant source for maple syrup. With the completion and major upgrades to Interstates 94 / 694, 494, and U.S. Highway 169, Maple Grove has grown at a rapid pace since the 1970s. Maple Grove has grown into one of the most populous cities in the Twin Cities area, and identified as one of the fastest growing cities in the state. Maple Grove was also named the second best place to live in 2014 by Money magazine.

Other major employers include the Independent School District 279 and the city of Maple Grove. The city is home to a gravel mining area owned by Tiller Corporation and C.S. McCrossan. Active since the 1920s, the GMA is slowly being developed into a residential and commercial downtown. The first phase included Main Street, a collection of one- and two-story buildings with storefronts built in new urbanist (or neotraditional) style. The second phase was generally considered to be the Shoppes of Arbor Lakes and the third phase was the Fountains at Arbor Lakes. Minnesota's first so-called 'lifestyle center', The Shoppes at Arbor Lakes, is designed in the spirit of a mid- century American village and includes stores such as Pottery Barn, Brooks Brothers, Williams Sonoma, GoodThings, Hot Mama, Anthropologie, P.F. Chang's, World Market, and numerous other upscale stores. This lifestyle center was built in 2003 and has been replicated in Woodbury, Minnesota (Woodbury Lakes). Maple Grove's Shoppes at Arbor Lakes is in size and is home to more than 65 stores and restaurants. The most recent Arbor Lakes development is a hybrid power center development called The Fountains at Arbor Lakes. At , this retail complex includes stores such as Costco, Caribou Coffee, Subway, DSW, Lowe's, REI and a Holiday Inn & Suites with a water park. The Fountains also includes Minnesota's most energy efficient building, Great River Energy Headquarters. Maple Grove's most recent development, The Grove, is located at the intersection of Interstate 94 and Maple Grove Parkway. This district is home to the new North Memorial/Fairview hospital complex, SuperTarget, Home Depot, Slumberland and other stores. The central portion of the project is designed to be pedestrian-friendly and encourage a small-town atmosphere within the larger scale of the development. Maple Grove is home to more retail than nearly any other city in the state, second only to Bloomington, the home of the Mall of America. Maple Grove itself is likely to have nearly 6 million square feet (600,000 m2) of commercial development at build-out, which may soon push the city into the number one spot for retail square-footage. One prominent retail complex is the Grove Square shopping mall, which has a JCPenney anchor store. Opus Northwest, the developer of the property, selected the location of the initial property development because \\"it‚Äôs the first major city in upstate Minnesota\\" and serves as \\"a major hub for that submarket\\" drawing consumers from the entire upstate region.

The population was 13,953 at the 2010 census. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Minnesota State Highway 100 and County Road 81 are two of the main routes in the city. History Shortly after the Minnesota Territorial Legislative Assembly created Hennepin County in 1852, John C. Bohanon filed the first claim in the Township of Crystal Lake. Railroads didn't reach the area until 1880. A flag station was established near the farm of Alfred Parker and six years later he donated land for a depot. The community that grew around it came to be known as Parker's Station. In 1887 Minneapolis made an effort to secure more taxable property by annexing neighboring townships. In response, Crystal Lake farmers incorporated the Village of Crystal. Later that year, entrepreneur and real estate developer, Andrew B. Robbins came to Parker's Station on behalf of an Illinois business interest. Robbins was a former state senator and the brother-in-law of lumber baron, Thomas Barlow Walker. Robbins purchased 90 acres (360,000 m2) to the west of Lower Twin Lake to incorporate into the Robbinsdale Park subdivision. The summer of 1888 brought the first land boom. New industries moved in and a large Lutheran Seminary was built and Robbins began work on his Northern Car Company. The trolley manufacturing firm would eventually employ 150 people. In 1890 the Robbins built a 16-room Queen Anne-style mansion on Lower Twin Lake. After he moved his family in Robbins gathered investors and built the Hubbard Specialty Manufacturing Company. The firm made chairs and wheelbarrows. Despite his connections, Robbins was unable to persuade the Minneapolis Street Railway Company to extend a streetcar line up West Broadway. In 1891 he organized the North Side Street Railway Company and built his own line from the Minneapolis city limits to Robbinsdale Park. The street cars were pulled by horses until the line was converted to electricity. Robbins' development efforts led to tension between farm families and residents near the village center. A special election was held and a vote to dissolve the Village of Crystal carried unanimously. On April 19, 1893, the new 2.9 square mile village of Robbinsdale was organized.Robbinsdale by Peter James Ward Richie p.7 Arcadia Publishing, July 2014 Fawcett Publications was founded in 1919 in Robbinsdale with the publication of Captain Billy's Whiz Bang. In 1922 Fawcett introduced True Confessions magazine. The new publication, modeled on popular detective and romance pulps attracted a large female readership. In 1929 Fawcett launched Modern Mechanics. The magazine championed Yankee ingenuity and do it yourself projects. The first issue's cover line was \\"Build your own airplane!\\". Modern Mechanics was later renamed Mechanix Illustrated. Fawcett Publications eventually outgrew their offices in the Security State Bank Building on West Broadway. In 1930, the company relocated to the Sexton Building in downtown Minneapolis. The city's pulp magazine history is echoed in Robbinsdale's annual summer celebration, Whiz Bang Days. In 1940 Dr. Samuel Samuelson built Victory Hospital on property he already owned in Robbinsdale. The original marble faced, three story building had five operating rooms and 70 beds. In 1954, Victory Hospital was reorganized as a non-profit and renamed North Memorial . Over the next 50 years North Memorial grew into 518 bed medical center. Today North Memorial Medical Center is a regional trauma center with eight helicopters, 120 ambulances, and 725 employees. North Memorial Medical Center. Besides being one of the state's Level 1 Trauma Centers, it also operates AirCare, an air medical transport service. They have five flight bases around Minnesota. In 1951, Sidney and William Volk hired the architectural firm of Liebenberg and Kaplan to the Terrace Theatre. Situated on a rise overlooking Crystal Lake and Bottineau Boulevard, the theater is considered by many to be a masterpiece of mid-century modern design. The building's rectangular volumes originally contained a 1300-seat auditorium, an expansive lobby, sunken garden style lounge with a large copper fireplace, sweeping foyers and two snack bars. The Terrace closed in 1999 and its out-of- state owner posted a \\"For Lease\\" sign but did not take care of the property. In May 2016 the City of Robbinsdale and State of Minnesota passed resolutions commemorating the Terrace as an important historic landmark. However, the city pursued demolition, giving rise to controversy between those who felt the theater was now a blighted property and others who wanted to reopen the Terrace as a point of community pride and a unique gathering place for music, film, and theater. A group of more than 2,000 supporters had petitioned the city to preserve and restore the theater, but area residents who wanted a nearby grocery store prevailed. After the city granted Tax Increment Financing to a developer to demolish the theater and the nearby mall and build a big box grocery store, a group of Terrace supporters filed a lawsuit to prevent demolition. The lawsuit was denied, and the theater was torn down in 2016 to be replaced by a 96,000 sq. ft. Hy-Vee grocery store.http://www.kare11.com/news/robbinsdale-theatre-torn-down-city-looks-to- future/328345283 Education Robbinsdale is served by Robbinsdale Area Schools.

The population was 8,597 at the 2010 census. However, the population increased to over 11,000 upon the annexation of surrounding Hassan Township in 2012. The population of Hassan Township was 2,600 in 2010, giving the current city a population base of 11,197 as of the census. In the 2010 census, the center of population of Minnesota was located in Rogers.https://www.census.gov/geo/www/2010census/centerpop2010/statecenters.html The city is a northwest suburb of the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area. Located on either side of Interstate 94, with Minnesota State Highway 101 running north, Rogers has been teeming with growth for the past 20 years. The 2000‚Äì2010 (8,597) population growth rate was +139.6%. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, as of the 2010 Census, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Upon the 2012 annexation of Hassan Township, the total land area of the City grew to approximately 26 square miles. History In the 1880s, John Rogers sold an acre of his land, then part of Hassan Township, to Great Northern Railroad for a dollar. The new depot provided a convenient stop for the rich timber resources of the area, and served as the beginning ground of a new community. When St. Martin Catholic Church and school were added, Rogers grew in local importance, consequently causing new businesses to be built and the town to be regarded as more of a local hub than other nearby communities such as Fletcher. In 1914, the city was incorporated. Throughout the years the town grew slowly until, in 1972, Interstate 94 was constructed. Running right through Rogers, the new freeway provided easy access to Minneapolis and Saint Paul, causing additional businesses such as Graco, CDI, Dept. 56 and Reinhart FoodService to add operations. The additional jobs created new population growth. As growth occurred, additional land was required, causing Rogers to annex more and more land from the surrounding Hassan Township. Hassan was completely annexed into Rogers on January 1, 2012. Early founding families names still serve as key contributors to the community. Otto Scharber was a prominent local businessman, owning a grocery store, hardware store, and a John Deere implement dealership, which is still in family operation today. Tornado On September 16, 2006, an F2 tornado damaged homes in Rogers, killing one person. The tornado began three miles west of Rogers at 9:52 p.m. The tornado made its first strike on Rogers at 9:54 p.m. The tornado traveled along a path that was eight miles, and lasted for approximately 12 minutes. The tornado also resulted in six injuries and the death of a 10 year old girl Jayme Wendt Annexation of Hassan Township On January 1, 2012, Hassan Township, Hennepin County's last township, was completely annexed into Rogers. Talks of annexation between Rogers and Hassan Township can be traced back to the 1970s, but the formal agreement was approved on December 30, 2003. In 2008, the Rogers City Council and the Hassan Town Board accelerated the annexation date to January 1, 2012. This was the third and final phase of annexation, boosting the Rogers population to over 11,000 residents. Education Rogers has multiple schools within its borders, including four public schools: Rogers Elementary, Hassan Elementary, Rogers Middle School, and Rogers High School, with the mascot being the Rogers Royal. Numerous private schools have also cropped up over the city's history. Rogers High School was ranked #32 in Minnesota for 2018 by U.S. News and World Report based on performance on state-required tests and how well they prepare students for college.

Ely was founded as a stagecoach station along the Pony Express and Central Overland Route. In 1906 copper was discovered. Ely's mining boom came later than the other towns along US 50\\\\. The railroads connecting the transcontinental railroad to the mines in Austin, Nevada and Eureka, Nevada have long been removed, but the railroad to Ely is preserved as a heritage railway by the Nevada Northern Railway and known as the Ghost Train of Old Ely. As of the 2010 census, the population was 4,255. History Ely, 1906 In 1878, Vermont resident J. W. Long came to White Pine County and soon set up a camp known as \\"Ely\\", after discovering gold. The name \\"Ely\\" has been credited to several possible origins: Long's hometown of Ely, Vermont; a New York Congressman with the surname Ely, who sent Long as a representative according to local historians; Smith Ely, a Vermont native who financed one of the city's early mineral operations; and John Ely, an Illinois native who came to Nevada for mining. Ely was founded as a stagecoach station along the Pony Express and Central Overland Route. Ely's mining boom came later than the other towns along US 50, with the discovery of copper in 1906. This made Ely a mining town, suffering through the boom-and-bust cycles so common in the West. Originally, Ely was home to a number of copper mining companies, Kennecott Utah Copper being the most famous. With a crash in the copper market in the mid-1970s, Kennecott shut down and copper mining disappeared (temporarily). With the advent of cyanide heap leaching‚Äîa method of extracting gold from what was previously considered very low-grade ore‚Äîthe next boom was on. Many companies processed the massive piles of \\"overburden\\" that had been removed from copper mines, or expanded the existing open-pit mines to extract the gold ore. Gold mines as widespread as the Robinson project near Ruth, and AmSelco's Alligator Ridge mine from Ely, kept the town alive during the 1980s and 1990s, until the recent revival of copper mining. As Kennecott's smelter was demolished, copper concentrate from the mine is now shipped by rail to Seattle, where it is transported to Japan for smelting. The dramatic increase in demand for copper in 2005 has once again made Ely a copper boom town. The now-defunct BHP Nevada Railroad ran from the mining district south of Ruth through Ely to the junction with the Union Pacific at Shafter from 1996‚Äì1999.

The population was 1,148 at the 2010 census. History In 1872, John Cowger established a ranch in the Steptoe Valley and acquired the water rights for the area. William Lyons and William McGill purchased the ranch in 1886. A post office was established at the ranch, now named McGill Ranch, in 1891. The Nevada Consolidated Copper Company had numerous mines in the region and was seeking a partner to create a smelter in the area. The Cumberland and Ely Mining Corporation had acquired of land near the ranch and thought it would be ideal for a smelter location due to access to a plentiful water source. The two companies formed a partnership, the Steptoe Valley Smelting and Mining Company. In 1906, a pipeline was built to bring water from Duck Creek to reservoirs near the smelter site and construction began on the smelter. The smelter was completed and operations began on May 15, 1908. The first copper was shipped from the smelter on August 7 of the same year. The town was briefly known as Smelter, before being renamed McGill, after the ranch. The population of the town grew from its inception to 1,904 in 1910 and 2,864 in 1920. Kennecott Utah Copper acquired Nevada Consolidated Copper Company, which included Steptoe Valley Smelting and Mining Company and the smelter at McGill in 1932. In 1983, the price of copper along with the low grade ore being mined led to Kennecott closing the smelter and demolishing it.

History Originally called \\"New Durham Gore\\"Hayward's New England Gazetteer (1839) because of rocky upland areas, or \\"gores\\", the town was settled in 1770, mainly by farmers because the highland areas provided less frost. Merchants then filled the lowlands. Early Alton history recounts stories of the merchants trying to convince the farmers to incorporate.

The lakeside village of Glendale lies within Gilford's borders. History Settled in 1778 and originally a part of Gilmanton, the town was first called Gunstock Parish. In 1812, Captain Lemuel B. Mason, who had fought in the 1781 Battle of Guilford Court House in North Carolina during the Revolutionary War and subsequently retired to Gunstock Parish, successfully proposed incorporation of a new town to be named Guilford after that battle. The name would later be contracted by clerical error. The original parish name is used by Gunstock Mountain and the ski resort located on it.

Gilford lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed. New Hampshire Route 11 crosses the town from east to west, connecting Alton and Rochester to the east with Laconia to the west. NH 11 joins U.S. Route 3 near the western border of Gilford, and together they turn south on the Laconia Bypass, which is largely within the Gilford town limits, traveling southwest towards Tilton and Franklin. New Hampshire Route 11A is an alternate east-west route to NH 11, passing through the center of Gilford and by the entrance to Gunstock Mountain Resort. New Hampshire Route 11B leaves NH 11 near Sanders Bay on Lake Winnipesaukee and proceeds northwest to Weirs Beach in Laconia. = Adjacent municipalities = *Moultonborough (north) *Alton (east) *Gilmanton (southeast) *Belmont (south) *Laconia (west) *Meredith (northeast) Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 6,803 people, 2,766 households, and 2,019 families residing in the town.

But workarounds are frequently as creative as true solutions, involving outside the box thinking\\"It requires that social workers think 'outside the box' - outside their normal frames of ... in their creation. Typically they are considered brittle in that they will not respond well to further pressure from a system beyond the original design. In implementing a workaround it is important to flag the change so as to later implement a proper solution. Placing pressure on a workaround may result in later system failures. For example, in computer programming workarounds are often used to address a problem or anti-pattern in a library, such as an incorrect return value. When the library is changed, the workaround may break the overall program functionality, effectively becoming an anti-pattern, since it may expect the older, wrong behaviour from the library. Workarounds can also be a useful source of ideas for improvement of products or services.  Legal workarounds  When the legal system places an obstacle in the form of a restriction or requirement, the law may provide a possible workaround. Laws intended to tap into what may seem to be deep pockets may lead to what are at least temporary solutions such as: * Since \\"most French workplace laws affect businesses with 50 or more employees... many French companies opt to employ only 49 people in avoidance of crippling legislations.\\" * An injunction against Microsoft regarding XML features and an easy technical workaround, a patent attorney suggested having two versions of MS Word, one with and one without the feature. = Acronyms = Some well-known acronyms were created to work around bureaucratic or contracting restrictions: * PDP - The term was used to describe a computer by another name, due to contracting complications for purchasing or leasing computers.

Tilton (1827‚Äì1901) was the owner of textile mills and the community's wealthiest citizen. Nathaniel Tilton established an iron foundry and the area's first hotel, the Dexter House. Charles E. Tilton donated many statues to the town, a unique feature, and his estate is now part of the Tilton School. Tilton Hall, his former mansion built in 1861, houses the Lucian Hunt Library. The attached carriage house was renovated in 1980 to become the Helene Grant Daly Art Center. Charles E. Tilton also donated what is perhaps the most notable landmark in the area, the hilltop Memorial Arch, located in the neighboring town of Northfield, across the Winnipesaukee River from the center of Tilton.

History Settled in 1726 by Scots-Irish immigrants, the town was first named Coleraine after the Protestant-majority town of that name in County Londonderry in what has since become Northern Ireland. Fertile ground made it popular with farmers. It was later renamed Brookfield, after Brookfield, Massachusetts, and made a part of Middleton. But in 1785 Brookfield petitioned, unsuccessfully, to be set off from Middleton. This was due to the division of the original town of Middleton into two parts by the long, high ridge of Moose Mountain, then a considerable obstacle to travel. Town meetings, traditionally held in the muddy season of March, were particularly difficult to attend for those beyond the ridge. In 1794, however, permission was granted, and Brookfield incorporated. And in 1840, when Carroll County was set off from Strafford County, Brookfield went with Carroll, and Middleton remained with Strafford. In 1874, the Wolfeborough Branch Railroad passed through this town.Article in Statistics and Gazetteer of New-Hampshire (1875) Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water, comprising 1.68% of the town.

History Storefronts in Two Harbors In the early years Two Harbors consisted of two separate communities, Agate Bay and Burlington. The village of Burlington along Burlington Bay was platted in 1856, first incorporated on May 23, 1857; it had a post office that operated from 1856 until 1862. The first residence constructed in Agate Bay was owned by Thomas Sexton (1854); it was a 14- by 16-foot shack. Early settlers lived in primitive conditions, which was common for both the area and time. Their homes were made of logs and had dirt floors. Diets often consisted of homegrown vegetables and animals caught in the area (at that time there were many dense forests, so deer meat was not an abundant food source). The village of Agate Bay was created with the construction camp as work on the new railroad began in 1883. The village of Two Harbors was platted in 1885 but not incorporated until 1888. Early transportation to the village was by boats under contract with the new Duluth and Iron Range Railroad. It took only \\"one short day\\" to get from Duluth to Two Harbors. By 1886 the D&IR; completed the Lake Division connecting Duluth and Two Harbors with passenger service that extended to Ely. Thirty-five logging camps were set up within the vicinity, one of them on Fourth Avenue. On February 26, 1907, the village reincorporated as the City of Two Harbors. The town's history is included in the Lake County Historical Depot Museum. =Whiskey Row= Loading Docks at Two Harbors, 1927 By 1883 the Minnesota Iron Company had purchased all but four acres of Thomas Sexton's land around Agate Bay. Sexton leased his remaining four acres to merchants seeking to capitalize on the 600-man workforce arriving to build the Duluth & Iron Range Railroad. He divided his four acres into 32 lots. As with any frontier town of the day it was a largely male population. The infamous four-acre plot earned the nickname \\"Whiskey Row\\", and was said to exist for the sole purpose of \\"relieving a man from his pay\\". Contrary to popular myth, Whiskey Row was not destroyed by a fire in 1888. There was a fire but it occurred before the first load of ore arrived in July 1884 and only seven buildings were damaged. It was reported that the merchants affected were in Duluth the next day purchasing materials to rebuild. Whiskey Row's demise occurred the following year. The railroad rapidly expanded its rail and shipping operations and needed all of the shoreline for its new coal handling and storage facility. By 1885 the Minnesota Iron Company convinced Sexton to sell his remaining four acres along Agate Bay. The railroad then simply evicted the tenants and moved any of the salvageable buildings inland. There are several homes in \\"east\\" Two Harbors whose original structures were on Whiskey Row. =Railroad= Duluth, Missabe & Iron Range Railway 2-8-8-4 \\"Yellowstone\\" preserved at Two Harbors station Had it not been for the discovery of nearby iron ore, Two Harbors would not exist. The Minnesota Iron Company bought of land in order to build their railroad. In Agate Bay (Two Harbors) most of the land was bought from Thomas Sexton, who by that time had owned the land for twenty years. Although different locations were considered for the railroad terminus and shipping port, Agate Bay was chosen because it was closer to the iron ore site and provided a clay bottom bay, while most others were rocky. At time when the track was being developed the main transportation route was Lake Superior. This proved difficult when heavy loads such as railroad engines nearly sank the scows, or tugs, that carried them. The contractor, John. S. Wolfe, was told he would receive a bonus of $50,000 if the railroad was completed by August 1st 1884\\\\. Because the first of August was to fall on a Friday, and construction workers had strong superstitions about Fridays, it became important that the construction be completed by Thursday, July 31st. On that day, the first iron ore cars left Agate Bay early in the morning, along with a caboose for President Tower to ride in on the return trip. The completion of the railway between Duluth and Two Harbors did not occur until 1886. The North Shore Scenic Railroad operates a six-hour excursion starting in Duluth which has a two-hour break in Two Harbors. A 2-6-0 Mogul class steam locomotive with the first style of ore cars and caboose are on display by the historic Duluth and Iron Range depot. A 2-8-8-4 Yellowstone class steam locomotive is on display at Two Harbors. It ranks among the largest steam locomotives ever built. =Former industries= Cigar factories Two Harbors Cigar Factory was built in 1900 by John H. Kallin on the 100 block of 7th Street. The local trade alone required about 30,000 cigars each month. They came in eight regular brands and five specialty. In 1907 Ed Sorenson built Sorenson Cigar Factory. Neither factory is still in operation. Universal Fiberglass In 1964 the abandoned DM&IR; railroad buildings were used to open Universal Fiberglass. Producing three wheel mailsters for the United States Postal Service was their main contract, worth millions. In addition, car fenders and like objects were also produced. When a fire caused enough damage that they could no longer fulfill their contract, the GSA shut them down. The property was sold at a public auction. Bottling works Two Harbors Bottling works began in 1912. They offered flavors of pop such as cream soda, ginger ale, cider, and seltzer water. The company became especially known for their strawberry pop's unique flavor‚Äîa creamier and more natural one than the rest. This business is no longer running. 3M 3M, originally known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, was started by five men from Two Harbors. When the five founders thought they had found mineral called corundum, which could be used to make sandpaper, they began the process of setting up a mining company. The five men were Henry S. Bryan, Dr. J. Danley Budd, Herman Cable, William McGonagle, and John Dwan. To get the company started they erected a large dock, crushing mill and bunk and storage houses. After selling the corundum to a company in Chicago the men learned that it wasn't really corundum and moved on to other ventures. In 1905 the company was moved to Duluth and then in 1907 to St. Paul. The company still had ties in Two Harbors until the death of John Dwan. Now the only tie 3M has to Two Harbors is a museum in Dwan's original office. The museum is in 3M's original building. Exhibits include Dwan's recreated office and other artifacts; a history of the company including photos and documents; a \\"lab\\" area representing the establishment of research and development, product diversification and growth; and hands-on interactive programs and technology applications. The original office building has been restored and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The initial establishment of Angle Township being in the United States was due to a map- maker's error. Benjamin Franklin and British representatives established the initial U.S. and Canadian borders in the Treaty of Paris in 1783 from a map that mis-represented the source of the Mississippi River. In 1997, in order to change what were considered unequal fishing regulations between the U.S. and Canada, Angle Township resident Gary Dietzler utilized this cartographical mishap to implement a mock secession from the United States, going so far as to get a bill issued by their Congressman Collin Peterson (D) in the U.S. House of Representatives. The mock secession succeeded in getting fishing regulations better synchronized across these international (fresh) waters.

Parts of the White Mountain National Forest are in the west, north and east.  History  Bird's-eye View in 1907 Once consisting of several large land grants by Colonial Governor John Wentworth, the town was first named New Madbury, after the seacoast town of Madbury. In 1772, a road was built through Pinkham Notch, and the area was first settled in 1778 by Benjamin Copp and his family. In 1800, the community was renamed in honor of President John Adams, who was then in office. The name Adams stuck until the town was incorporated in 1829, when Andrew Jackson, the hero of the Battle of New Orleans, was inaugurated president. Governor Benjamin Pierce, a staunch backer of President Jackson, was influential in changing the name to Jackson. Only one vote was cast against the switch. In 1847, artists of the White Mountain School began arriving in Jackson to paint the scenic beauty of the White Mountains. Others would follow, and in 1858, Joshua B. Trickey opened the Jackson Falls House. The Portland & Ogdensburg Railroad began service to Glen station at nearby Bartlett in the early 1870s, and several hotels were built to accommodate a growing infusion of tourists. Thorn Mountain House, built by Trickey in 1869, would evolve during the 1880s into Wentworth Hall, still in business today. Designed as a grouping of cottages around a main service building, the hotel included such amenities as a casino, built in 1886, and a hydroelectric plant, built in the 1890s. By the 1920s, 40 trains a day delivered passengers to Jackson. The increasing use of automobiles, however, reduced travel by train, as vacationers could venture beyond the limits of rail service. Consequently, some grand 19th century hotels lost patrons and closed, although the town itself would never lose popularity. Jackson is one of the region's most picturesque villages, famous in part for Jackson Falls and Jackson X-C, a 150+ kilometer cross-country skiing trail system, rated one of the best in the world. Wildcat Mountain, with an unsurpassed view of Mount Washington, is a favorite alpine skiing destination. Jackson is perhaps best known for its red covered bridge (the Honeymoon Bridge), built in 1876, one of the most photographed in the state.

Moultonborough is bounded in large part by Lake Winnipesaukee in the southwest and to a lesser extent by Squam Lake in the northwest corner. The town includes the census- designated place of Suissevale and the community of Lees Mill. The town generally votes Republican. History Moultonborough Corner in 1910 The first European settlers were grantees from Hampton, among whom were at least sixteen Moultons, giving the town its name. The first recorded town meeting took place on March 31, 1777, at which Jonathan Moulton was elected town clerk, among other officials elected that day. The town was incorporated on November 27, 1777. Colonel Moulton (later a brigadier general) was considered to be one of the richest men in the province at the start of the American Revolution. Moultonborough was chartered in 1763 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, and at the time was described as being near the \\"Winnepisseoky Pond\\". It was officially incorporated in 1777. Native Americans inhabited the area before being killed and/or forcibly relocated by the new settlers. Records indicate parts of the Winnipesaukee lakefront were fishing grounds, such as Greens Basin. Moultonborough is home to the \\"Castle in the Clouds\\", an estate set in the Ossipee Mountains. Thomas Gustave Plant made a fortune manufacturing shoes, bought and hired the Boston architectural firm of J. Williams Beal & Sons to design \\"Lucknow\\", a stone mansion built between 1913 and 1914. The property, with sweeping views of Lake Winnipesaukee, is a popular tourist attraction. A steam boat show occurs in Moultonborough in the summer, usually later in the season, that goes around the rim of the town's extensive waterfront property.

The population was 2,349 at the 2010 census. A year-round resort area, North Conway is the largest village within the town of Conway, which is bounded on the east by the Maine state line. The White Mountain National Forest is to the west and north. Conway is home to Cathedral Ledge (popular with climbers), Echo Lake State Park, and Mount Cranmore. North Conway is known for its large number of outlet shops. Aerial view of North Conway and Mount Cranmore  History  Mount Washington in 1872 Chartered in 1765 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, the town is named for Henry Seymour Conway, ambitious son of a prominent English family, who was elected to the House of Commons at age 20, fought at Culloden, and became Secretary of State. Early settlers called the area Pequawket (known colloquially as Pigwacket), adopting the name of the Abenaki Indian village which stretched down the Saco River to its stockaded center at Fryeburg, Maine. North Conway is in the White Mountains, with Mount Washington to the northwest. The rugged terrain became popular in the 19th century with artists. Their paintings were known collectively as White Mountain art, which in turn attracted tourists to the area, particularly after the Portsmouth, Great Falls & Conway Railroad extended service in 1872 to North Conway. In 1874, the line built a Second Empire depot, designed by Nathaniel J. Bradlee. In 1932, \\"snow trains\\" began carrying enthusiasts to \\"the birthplace of American skiing,\\" as North Conway is known. Increasing automobile travel brought the decline of trains. The railroad, then part of the Boston & Maine, abandoned passenger service to the area in 1961 and freight service in 1972. Subsequently, the Conway Scenic Railroad was established. Today, the line offers visitors a tour of the region, including Crawford Notch. The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the late 1980s, the White Mountain Airport closed and was redeveloped as a large outlet mall called Settlers' Green Outlet Village. Continued growth through the 1990s and 2000s in North Conway and the villages nearby made Conway the most populous community in Carroll County. Traffic congestion led to an overhaul of the road system, including widening Route 16 through North Conway village and constructing a road parallel to Route 16 to allow traffic to move between Redstone and Intervale uninterrupted. A bypass of the area is being developed. North Conway remains a popular destination due to its shopping, recreation, and attractions. North Conway Station Recreation Cathedral Ledge in 1914 North Conway and its surrounding towns offer hiking in the White Mountain National Forest. The area is a major rock climbing destination in the northeastern United States, particularly Cathedral Ledge in Echo Lake State Park. The cliff overlooks Echo Lake and North Conway from the west. Unlike nearby White Horse Ledge, another rock climbing site, Cathedral Ledge has an automobile road to the summit, which provides fine views of the Saco River Valley. In late September through early October, tourists arrive to see the autumn foliage on the surrounding mountains and forests. The Conway Scenic Railroad features train rides that leave from the village's Victorian station. In the winter, the village is the nighttime destination for skiers visiting the area resorts, including North Conway's own Cranmore Mountain as well as nearby Attitash Resort, Black Mountain and Wildcat Mountain.

The population was 4,345 at the 2010 census.United States Census Bureau, American FactFinder, 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011. It is the county seat of Carroll County. Ossipee, which includes several villages, is a resort area and home to part of Pine River State Forest. History Center Ossipee c. 1915 Originally known as Wigwam Village, and then New Garden, the town was named for the Ossipee Indians, one of the twelve Algonquian tribes. It was once the site of an Indian stockade fort, designed to protect the tribe from the Mohawks in the west. In 1725, the Indian stockade was destroyed, and then rebuilt by Captain John Lovewell. The new fort was one of the largest in New England. The fort was located where the second green of Indian Mound Golf now is. Wood, ramrods and the brass bolt used for the gate were discovered when the course was built. On February 22, 1785, the legislature incorporated Ossipee as a town. Although the surface of the town is \\"rough and uneven, and in some parts rocky and mountainous,\\" farmers found it suitable for pasturage, as well as for cultivating wheat and potatoes. Principal goods were produce, lumber and cattle. In 1859, when the population was 2,123, Ossipee contained twelve sawmills, five gristmills, twelve clapboard and shingle mills, one bedstead factory, one door factory, a sash and blind factory, one paper mill and four tanneries.Austin J. Coolidge & John B. Mansfield, A History and Description of New England; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 The Portsmouth, Great Falls & Conway Railroad in 1871 reached Ossipee Corner, with service extended in 1875 to Center Ossipee. The trains brought commerce and tourists, helping the town develop as a summer resort. Railroad service, however, would be discontinued in 1961 for passengers, and in 1972 for freight. The town shares its name with the Ossipee Mountains, a circular mountain range marking the location of an ancient volcanic ring dike, which borders it on the west. Ossipee is a major source of sand and gravel, transported by railroad to Boston, Massachusetts. Ossipee claims to be the home of the first snowmobile. In 1917, Virgil D. White set up to create a patent for his conversion kit that changed the Ford Model T into a \\"snowmobile\\". He also copyrighted the term \\"snowmobile\\". At the time, the conversion kit was expensive, costing about $395. Virgil White applied his patent in 1918 and created his own snowmobile. In 1922, his conversion kit was on the markets and available only through Ford dealerships. The welcome sign for the town that states \\"Home of the First Snowmobile\\" was put up in late 2010. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water, comprising 6.37% of the town. Ossipee is drained by the Ossipee, Pine, Beech, Bearcamp and Lovell rivers. Ossipee Lake is in the northeastern part of the town. The highest point in Ossipee is above sea level on an unnamed ridge in the Ossipee Mountains in the western part of town. The town is crossed by state routes 16, 25, 28 and 171. The two primary settlements in town are Center Ossipee, located near the southern junction of routes 16 and 25, and Ossipee Corner (shown as \\"Ossipee\\" on topographic maps), located south of Center Ossipee at the junction of routes 28 and 171 and close to Route 16. Other villages include West Ossipee, at the northern junction of routes 16 and 25 near the border with Tamworth; Moultonville, directly west of Center Ossipee; and Water Village, along Route 171 near the border with Tuftonboro. =Adjacent municipalities= * Madison (north) * Freedom (north) * Effingham (east) * Wakefield (southeast) * Wolfeboro (south) * Tuftonboro (southwest) * Moultonborough (west) * Tamworth (northwest) Demographics The Carroll County Courthouse in 1921.

The population was 45 at the 2010 census. History Cedar Mills was laid out in 1860, and named for nearby Cedar Lake, located two miles to the northeast. Cedar Mills Lake was first referred to on old maps by the explorers, Fremont and Nicollet. The lake had the Indian name of ‚ÄúRanti-tia-wita‚Äù or ‚Äú Island of the Red Cedar‚Äù. Daniel A. Cross was the first to make a settlement there with his family in 1856. He was later killed during the Sioux Uprising of 1862. In 1857, R. J. Brodwell, O. S. Merriam, Philander Ball, George R. Jewett, Elmer Eighmey, and a few others settled there. George Nichols built a flour mill there in 1858 and he ran it until 1867. The first store was established in the town by J. D. Baldwin. The first school was taught by Sophia Pratt in 1860, in the home of Daniel Cross. In September 1862, a small group of the Hutchinson Guards left the Hutchinson stockade and went to Meeker County in search of Caleb Sanborn and other missing settlers. Some of the Guard were Daniel Cross, T. R. Webb, Lieutenant Oliver Pierce, and Frank Jewett. When the party reached the north side of Cedar Lake woods, they were suddenly ambushed by thirteen Indians. Daniel Cross was shot and killed instantly. The search party had no time to pick up Cross's body as they were running to escape. The Indians quickly scalped Daniel Cross, put his scalp on a pole, and carried it as a battle flag while they chased the men who were fleeing. T.R. Webb ran to Cedar Lake, jumped in a small boat, and paddled his way to Cedar Island where he hid for the night. Webb returned to Hutchinson the next morning. The remaining men also made it to Hutchinson safely. The next day a group of men went out to find the bodies of Cross and Sanborn, which had been badly mutilated, and they brought them back to Hutchinson. Here's another Sioux Uprising story that involved Cedar Mills. On Monday morning, August 18, 1862, Henry J. Lasher learned of the massacre at Acton, and he sent his family to his wife's brother-in-law, D. B. Peck, who lived nearby. Lasher set out to notify the settlers in Greenleaf of the attacks. He found the settlers had already gone, so he made his way back to Peck's. Henry sent his family back to his farm and he stayed to help Peck harvest. On Thursday, he heard gunfire coming from near his farm and so he went to Cedar Mills to get someone to accompany him back to his farm to see if his family was all right. No one would go to help him, so Henry went alone. On reaching his farm, he met a group of about twenty people who had left Forest City to come and bury those killed at Acton. Lasher and his family returned to Cedar Mills, and Peck, with his team of horses, hauled 1,600 pounds of flour and other provisions from his farm to Henry's. When they arrived at Henry's farm, they found some eight or ten families had gathered from the surrounding country, all bent on fleeing for safety. After some talk, it was decided to build a ‚Äúfort‚Äù and remain. Henry was appointed captain, and they decided to fortify ‚Äúthe Point‚Äù in Cedar Lake and remain there until the uprising was over. Weymouth and Lasher stood guard at the crossing by the Cedar Lake mill. On Wednesday, a party of thirty or forty refugees from Yellow Medicine County turned up, accompanied by a friendly Indian named John Other Day. With the refugees who arrived at Cedar Lake with Other Day was Stuart B. Garvie, who had been wounded by buck-shot in the lower abdomen. Garvie died the following day, August 22, in Lasher's house. An Indian named Haypinkpa or ‚ÄúTip of the Horn‚Äù was tried, convicted of the murder of Garvie, and hung in Mankato in the mass hangings. A post office called Cedar Mills was established in 1860 with Charles G. Topping as the postmaster. In 1861, Henry J. Lasher became the postmaster and during the Sioux Uprising he buried all the official papers and for years there was no post office in Cedar Mills. In 1870, it was established again but it closed in 1955. The town itself wasn't organized until January 25, 1870. Both Cedar Mills and Cosmos are located on the South Fork of the Crow River which empties into the Mississippi by Dayton, Minnesota.

Wakefield Corner, popular with tourists, is a picturesque hilltop village of antique buildings. The state of Maine is on the eastern border of Wakefield. History Initially a native settlement, Wakefield was attacked by John Lovewell during Father Rale's War. Settled later by colonists from Dover and Somersworth, the town was granted in 1749 by John Mason. It was called East Town before being incorporated as Wakefield in 1774 by Governor John Wentworth. Wakefield, in Yorkshire, England, is near Wentworth Castle, the home of the Wentworth ancestors. It developed as an important sledge and stage stop between the seacoast and the White Mountains. The Wakefield Inn, built in 1804 beside the principal trade route through Wakefield Corner, remains operating today. Although the soil was considered \\"stubborn,\\" farmers made it productive. Lumber became a chief product, and by 1859 there were five sawmills, five gristmills, and ten shingle, clapboard and planing mills. Shoemaking was another local industry.

History The town was chartered by Massachusetts Governor Jonathan Belcher in 1735 as one in a line of nine forts intended to protect southwestern New Hampshire from Indian attack. It was granted as Newton or Newtown in 1752 by Governor Benning Wentworth, but would be incorporated in 1763 as Alstead. It was named for Johann Heinrich Alsted, who compiled an early encyclopedia that was popular at Harvard College. Settled about 1764, Alstead would be one of the towns that wavered in its allegiance after the Revolutionary War. It decided to join Vermont in April 1781, but at the insistence of George Washington, returned to New Hampshire authority early the next year. Formerly known as Paper Mill Village, Alstead is the location of the state's first paper mill. It was established in 1793 on the Cold River by Ephraim and Elisha Kingsbury. Paper was then a rare and expensive product, made by chopping rags of linen and cotton cloth into pulp. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1880. While Alstead was basically an agricultural community, its streams and ponds once powered a variety of small mills. A turbine water mill at East Alstead is probably the last of its type anywhere in the region.History of Alstead, Cheshire County, New Hampshire Shedd-Porter Memorial Library, built in 1909-1910 in the Beaux-Arts style, was a gift to Alstead and Langdon by native son John G. Shedd, president of Marshall Field's department store in Chicago. Another native son philanthropist, Charles M. Vilas, gave a large public recreation area, school building and the only carillon in Cheshire County. On the weekend of October 8‚Äì9, 2005, parts of Alstead were devastated by a severe flood. Heavy rain in Cheshire County caused the Cold River and its tributaries to swell, washing away homes, cars and four miles of Route 123. Four inhabitants of the town were killed. A Save Our History grant from The History Channel provided funding to the Alstead Historical Society and several students of the local high school, who wrote and printed a book called Too Much Water, Too Much Rain, chronicling the disaster and its aftermath.

Frankford Village The village of Frankford Village was settled along the banks of Deer Creek in 1854 by Lewis Patchin, Bartlett Leathers, and Byron Woodworth. The town was platted in 1856 and it was declared the county seat. At one time it was a bustling frontier village that had three stores, a schoolhouse, a cemetery, three blacksmith and wagon shops, a gristmill, a chair and coffin factory, a shoe shop and the Patchin Hotel which also served as the post office. County court was held here and the county's records were stored in an upstairs room of Patchin's Hotel. After being passed over as the county's seat, its population slowly dwindled. When the Southern Minnesota Railroad was laid in 1870 it ran four miles south of the village and this development is what ultimately spelled doom for the once-thriving community. Rather than move the city to the railroad as the citizens of the Old Village of Le Roy did, the citizens simply relocated to other parts of the township and county. All that is left of the old village is a cemetery, which is still used, that can be found in the northeast quadrant of section 24 of Frankford Township.

History Town center in 1906 In 1749, the Masonian proprietors granted the town as Monadnock No. 3 (or North Monadnock) to Matthew Thornton and 39 others. The 40 grantees came mostly from middle and eastern parts of New Hampshire; none of them grantees became settlers in the township. The deed of grant, which dated November 3, 1749, was given by Col. Joseph Blanchard of Dunstable. The French and Indian War thwarted permanent settlement until the 1760s, when Henry Strongman moved from Peterborough. Other early settlers arrived from Sherborn, Massachusetts. In 1771, Governor John Wentworth incorporated the town, naming it after Strongman's birthplace: Dublin, Ireland. Like all towns in this area, the terrain features hills and valleys. Farmers found the soil hard and rocky, but with effort it yielded maize, oats, barley and potatoes, with some wheat and rye.

History Lake Wilson was platted in 1883 and incorporated as a village on July 12, 1900. It was named by J. E. Wilson (a landowner in the area) who also named the nearby lake for himself. On June 16, 1992, Lake Wilson was struck by a devastating F5 tornado that completely destroyed half of the town, which has since been rebuilt. On January 12, 2004, the city's firehall exploded, destroying it and the nearby elevator. It also damaged many nearby houses and businesses. The blast was audible at 25 miles, and could be felt as far as 30 miles away. The city estimated that recovery costs resulting from the explosion totaled about $4.2 million. Since then both the firehall and elevator have been rebuilt. Politics Lake Wilson is located in Minnesota's 1st congressional district, represented by Mankato educator Tim Walz, a Democrat.

The population was 12,764 at the 2010 census. The city's site was first settled in the 1870s as Okabena Station on a line of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway, later the Chicago and North Western Railway (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad) where steam engines would take on water from adjacent Lake Okabena. More people entered along with one A. P. Miller of Toledo, Ohio, under a firm called the National Colony Organization. Miller named the new city after his wife's maiden name. History The first European likely to have visited the Nobles County area of southwestern Minnesota was French explorer Joseph Nicollet. Nicollet mapped the area between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers in the 1830s. He called the region ‚ÄúSisseton Country‚Äù in honor of the Sisseton band of Dakota Indians then living there. It was a rolling sea of wide open prairie grass that extended as far as the eye could see. One small lake in Sisseton Country was given the name ‚ÄúLake Okabena‚Äù on Nicollet's map, ‚ÄúOkabena‚Äù being a Dakota word meaning ‚Äúnesting place of the herons.‚Äùhttps://books.google.com/books?id=8AMwAAAAYAAJ A.P. Rose's History of Nobles County pp. 34-35 The town of Worthington was founded by \\"Yankees\\" (immigrants from New England and upstate New York who were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s).The expansion of New England: the spread of New England settlement and institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620‚Äì1865 page 247 In 1871, the St. Paul & Sioux City Railway Company began connecting its two namesake cities with a rail line. The steam engines of that time required a large quantity of water, resulting in water stations being needed every along their routes. One of these stations, at the site of present-day Worthington, was designated ‚ÄúThe Okabena Railway Station.‚Äù Meanwhile, in that same year, Professor Ransom Humiston of Cleveland, Ohio, and Dr. A.P. Miller, editor of the Toledo Blade, organized a company to locate a colony of New England settlers who had already settled in Northern Ohio along the tracks of the Sioux City and St. Paul Railway. These people were \\"Yankee\\" settlers whose parents had moved from New England to the region of Northeast Ohio known as the Connecticut Western Reserve. They were primarily members of the Congregational Church, though due to the Second Great Awakening, many of them had converted to Methodism and Presbyterianism, and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Minnesota. This colony‚Äîthe National Colony‚Äîwas to be a village of temperance, a place where evangelical Methodists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists could live free of the temptations of alcohol. A town was plotted, and the name was changed from the Okabena Railway Station to Worthington, the maiden name of Dr. Miller's mother-in-law.Worthington album : A project of the Worthington Daily Globe by Crippen, Raymond. Heritage House Publishers, 1998. On April 29, 1872, regular passenger train service to Worthington started, and on that very first train were the first of the National Colony settlers. One early arrival described the scene: We were among the first members of the colony to arrive at the station of an unfinished railroad‚Ä¶ There was a good hotel, well and comfortably furnished, one or two stores neatly furnished and already stocked with goods, [and] several other[s] in process of erection‚Ä¶ The streets, scarcely to be defined as such, were full of prairie schooners, containing families waiting until masters could suit themselves with ‚Äúclaims,‚Äù the women pursuing their housewifely avocations meanwhile‚Äîsome having cooking stoves in their wagons, others using gypsy fires to do their culinary work; all seeming happy and hopeful. Some settlers from New England were drinking men, most of them Civil War veterans from Massachusetts and Maine, who came into conflict with the temperance movement.Nobles County - Minnesota Historical Records Survey Project - The Project - 1939 A curious event took place on Worthington's very first Fourth of July celebration. Hearing that there was a keg of beer in the Worthington House Hotel, Professor Humiston entered the hotel, seized the keg, dragged it outside, and destroyed it with an axe. A witness described what happened next: Upon seeing this, the young men of the town thought it to be rather an imposition, and collected together, procured the services of the band, and under the direction of a military officer marched to the rear of the hotel, and with a wheelbarrow and shovel took the empty keg that had been broken open, and playing the dead march with flag at half staff marched to the flagpole in front of Humiston's office where they dug a grave and gave the empty keg a burial with all the honors attending a soldier's funeral. They then, with flag at full mast and with lively air, marched back to the ice house, procured a full keg of beer, returning to the grave, resting the keg thereon. Then a general invitation was given to all who desired to partake, which many did until the keg was emptied... In the evening they reassembled, burning Prof. Humiston in effigy about 10 p.m. Thus ended the glorious Fourth at Worthington, Minn. ‚ÄîSibley Gazette July 5, 1872From New Cloth : The making of Worthington by Hudson, Lew. Published by American Legion Post #5, Worthington, MN 1976, In spite of tensions between pro- and anti- temperance factions, the town grew rapidly. By the end of summer in 1872, 85 buildings had been constructed where just one year before there had been nothing but a field of prairie grass. Settlers poured into the region. At first they came almost exclusively from the six New England states due to issues of overpopulation combined with land shortages. Some had come from Upstate New York and had parents and grandparents who had moved to that region from New England during the early 1800s and late 1700s. Due to the large number of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York, Worthington, like much of Minnesota at the time, was very culturally continuous with early New England culture for much of its early history. It was the age of the Homestead Act, when of government land could be claimed for free. All one had to do was live on the land and ‚Äúimprove‚Äù it, a vague requirement. In such an atmosphere, settlers without connection to the National Colony also arrived in great number, and few of those were temperance activists. The ensuing winter was severe, and swarms of grasshoppers stripped farmers‚Äô fields bare in the summer of 1873. Still, settlers came. 1874 produced a bumper harvest, followed by another grasshopper invasion in 1875. 1876 and 1877 were both good farming years. Grasshoppers returned for the last time in 1879, and a bright future began for southwestern Minnesota. According to the 1880 census, Nobles County had 4,435 residents, 636 of them in Worthington. In the early 1900s German immigrants began arriving in Worthington in large numbers, not directly from Germany, but mostly from other places in the midwest, especially Ohio, where their communities had already been established.Nobles County History by Al Goff - Nobles County Historical Society, Minnesota - 1958 Unlike in other parts of the country, the Germans did not face xenophobia in Nobles County, but were welcomed by the Yankee population. This led to many writing back to Ohio, which led to chain migration to the region, greatly increasing the German-American population. The \\"Yankee\\" population of Americans of English descent did not come into conflict with the German-American community for much of their early history together, but the two communities were divided on the issue of World War I, the Yankee community divided about and the Germans unanimously opposed to American entry into the war. The Yankee community was generally pro-British, but many also did not want the United States to enter the war. The Germans were sympathetic to Germany and did not want the United States to enter into a war against Germany, but the Germans were not anti-British. Before World War I, many German community leaders in Minnesota and Wisconsin spoke openly and enthusiastically about how much better America was than Germany, due primarily (in their eyes) to the presence of English law and the English political culture the Americans had inherited from the colonial era, which they contrasted with the turmoil and oppression in Germany they had so recently fled.The German Historians and England: A Study in Nineteenth-century Views by Charles E. McClelland pages 19, 136, 138. 176, 196 Other immigrant groups followed the Germans, including settlers from Ireland, Norway and Sweden. From 1939 to 1940 Worthington was home to the Worthington Cardinals, a minor league baseball team. Worthington played as a member of the Class D Western League. The Worthington Cardinals were an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals.

The population was 6,014 at the 2010 census, and an estimated 6,273 in 2018. Rindge is home to Franklin Pierce University, the Cathedral of the Pines and part of Annett State Forest. History =Native American inhabitants= The land in and around Rindge was originally inhabited by ancestors of the Abenaki tribe of Native Americans. Archeological evidence from nearby Swanzey indicates that the region was inhabited as much as 11,000 years ago (coinciding with the end of the last glacial period). As much as half of the Western Abenakis were victims of a wave of epidemics that coincided with the arrival of Europeans in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Later, many of the Western Abenaki present in southwestern New Hampshire chose to relocate to Canada during Colonial times, primarily due to their allegiance with the French during the French and Indian Wars. =Settlement by European colonists= In the eighteenth century, Massachusetts granted unappropriated land to veterans of Sir William Phipps' 1690 expedition against French-held Canada as compensation for services. Whole townships were granted to certain military companies and became known as \\"Canada\\" townships. Granted in 1736 by Governor Jonathan Belcher to soldiers from Rowley, Massachusetts, Rindge was first known as Rowley-Canada. But the Masonian proprietors were making competing claims to the area, and in 1740 commissioners of the Crown decided that the boundary between Massachusetts and New Hampshire lay south of Rowley- Canada.Stearns, Ezra. History of the Town of Rindge. Boston: George Ellis, 1875, Reprinted by Phoenix Publishing, 1988. p. 37. Consequently, it was re- granted in 1749 by Governor Benning Wentworth as Monadnock No. 1, or South Monadnock. The town would be incorporated in 1768 by Governor John Wentworth as Rindge, in honor of Captain Daniel Rindge of Portsmouth, one of the original grant holders, and the one who represented New Hampshire's claim to the land before the king.Stearns, p. 35. Captain Abel Platts is credited as being Rindge's first temporary settler, arriving in 1738 to take possession of his family's land grant. But disputes about the grants, combined with the outbreak in 1744 of King George's War, made it untenable to remain in Rindge, so early settlers abandoned it. Platts and others returned in 1752, and starting in 1758, settlement increased steadily.Stearns, p. 66‚Äì67. There were 1,274 residents by 1859, when water powered industries included three gristmills, thirteen sawmills, thirteen shingle mills, six stave mills, two planing mills, and several clapboard mills.

History  The smallest town in Cheshire County, Roxbury was incorporated in 1812 from portions of Nelson, Marlborough, and Keene. By then, settlers had established agriculture among the rolling hillsides in the area, and a community center had developed at what is now called Roxbury Center. It was a \\"hill farm\\" community with some scattered small mills.

The population was 1,232 at the 2010 census. Between 1842 and 1873, the town was home to four glass manufacturers. The glass produced by these works, now known as Stoddard glass, is noted for its deep amber colors and design. Stoddard glass products are highly prized by collectors. History This territory was first granted in 1752 to Colonel Sampson Stoddard of Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and others as Monadnock Number 7. It was known locally as Limerick before being incorporated as Stoddard in 1774, in honor of Colonel Stoddard. Colonel Stoddard was appointed to survey southwestern New Hampshire by the colonial government, receiving several land grants for the service. One of his surveying assistants was Benjamin Pierce, father of U.S. President Franklin Pierce. Colonel Stoddard never lived in the town of Stoddard. The town was first settled in 1768 by John and Martha Taggart, immigrants from Derry, Ireland. Three years later, the Richardson family joined the Taggarts in Stoddard. By 1774, the town had 24 residents.Field, Stoddard Glass, pp. 16‚Äì17 The first census taken in Stoddard, in 1790, reported 701 residents. The town's first schoolhouses were built in 1792.Field, Stoddard Glass, p. 17 The first post office was established in 1822; Isaac Duncan was the first Postmaster. In 1800, Stoddard's 1,148 residents outnumbered those of the nearby county seat of Keene. During Stoddard's glass-manufacturing years, 800 people were employed by the industry.Field, Stoddard Glass, p. 19 After the Stoddard glass industry ended in the early 1870s, the town's population declined; by 1960, the census recorded 146 residents. , the town had 1,232 residents. =Stoddard glass= Between 1840 and 1873, Stoddard was a center of glass manufacturing, home to four glass factories whose products are prized by collectors today. The town's abundant forests fed the industry's need for the temperatures necessary to melt sand into glass. Stoddard also had plenty of clear, fine sand. The sand's trace minerals gave Stoddard glass its unique hues: manganese produced the olive green and amber colors most closely associated with Stoddard glass, and oxide of gold created a red-amber glass. The glass houses were located in two settlements within Stoddard: Joseph Foster's and the South Stoddard Glass Company were located in South Stoddard, which was located near the present-day intersection of state Routes 9 and 123. The Granite Glass Company and the New Granite Glass Works were located in Mill Village, near the present town center.Field, Stoddard Glass, p. 26 Among the wide variety of glass pieces turned out by the glass houses were Masonic flasks, containers for liquor and patent medicines, and bottles for mineral water bottled in Saratoga Springs, New York.Field, Stoddard Glass, 28‚Äì37. However, the fame of Stoddard glass does not come primarily from these commercial items, but from the \\"off-blown\\" pieces made by glassblowers at the end of the workday using leftover glass. These items, sometimes called \\"whimseys\\", could be anything desired by the glassblower, and were the property of the glassblower.Field, Stoddard Glass, p. 40. Several factors led to the demise of Stoddard's glass industry in the early 1870s. Other manufacturers had mastered the chemistry needed to create clear glass in quantity; gas and coal were now viable fuels for glassworks, eliminating the need for nearby forests; and improvements in mechanical manufacturing techniques made hand-blown glass economically unviable.Field, Stoddard Glass, pp. 19‚Äì20 The silica in Stoddard's sand prevented its use in making clear glass, which was in high demand after it became viable for bottles and glassware following the Civil War.Field, Stoddard Glass, p. 32.

Education The Town of Sullivan operates its own independent school district and school administrative unit, governed by a five-member elected school board. Students in Sullivan attend neighboring Nelson Elementary School for Kindergarten through grade six, Keene Middle School for grades seven and eight, and Keene High School. From 1960 to 2013, Sullivan had been a member of the cooperative Monadnock Regional School District. Its elementary-aged students attended school at the Sullivan Central School on Centre Street (until its closure in 2012) and neighboring Gilsum Elementary School. Middle and high school students attended Monadnock Regional High School in Swanzey. At the March 2012 annual town meeting, residents of Sullivan voted to begin the process of withdrawing from the cooperative school district. A withdrawal plan was passed by a district study committee and approved by school district voters on November 27, 2012. On July 1, 2013, the town began operating its own independent school district. By law, the former Sullivan Central School building has been reacquired by the new school district, but is not intended to be reopened.Report of Sullivan Withdrawal Committee, , September 5, 2012.

In addition to the town center, Swanzey includes the villages of East Swanzey, West Swanzey, North Swanzey and Westport. History First granted in 1733 as Lower Ashuelot, Swanzey was one of the fort towns established by Governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts, which then claimed the territory. The town was the site of many battles during King George's War, and in 1747 was abandoned for three years. It was regranted to 62 proprietors on July 2, 1753 by Governor Benning Wentworth as Swanzey, most probably because some early settlers had a connection to Swansea in Wales. Situated on the Ashuelot River and connected by the Ashuelot Railroad, West Swanzey developed as a textile mill town, and East Swanzey produced wooden buckets for generations. By 1859, the population was 2,106. The town features four covered bridges, and was the home of theatrical trouper Denman Thompson, who gained a national reputation by his portrayal of the Yankee farmer, \\"Joshua Whitcomb\\", star of his stage play The Old Homestead. Residents restage Thompson's melodrama every summer at a natural outdoor amphitheater called the Potash Bowl.New Hampshire Economic and Labor Market Information Bureau Profile Because he vacationed in Swanzey during several summers, the town has claimed to be the location of a tree that inspired poet Joyce Kilmer (1886‚Äì1918) to write the popular 1913 poem \\"Trees\\".

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Troy Village Historic District. History Bird's-eye view c. 1905 Settled in 1762, by 1815 the community had grown so much that it sought its own incorporation. It was set off from Marlborough that year, and included parts of Fitzwilliam, Swanzey and Richmond. A prominent citizen and friend of Governor John Taylor Gilman, Captain Benjamin Mann of Mason, suggested the name Troy. His daughter, Betsy, was married to Samuel Wilson, famous as \\"Uncle Sam\\", and at that time a resident of Troy, New York. At least seven members of Wilson's family were living in the town at the time, thus securing the name. The town hall, built in 1813-1814 near the rail-fenced common, was originally the village meetinghouse. Troy Mills, which started making horse blankets in the mid-19th century, served as the backbone of the town's economy for nearly 100 years. In 1865, the company was sold by founder Thomas Goodall, who in 1867 would establish Goodall Mills in Sanford, Maine. Troy Mills declared bankruptcy in late 2001, and ceased operations in 2002. The giant mill complex on Monadnock Street now houses two smaller spin-offs of Troy Mills‚ÄîKnowlton Nonwovens and Cosmopolitan Textiles. The Troy trademark is now used for felt made by a company in West Virginia. Wooden-ware, pottery and fine building stone were also once the products of Troy industries.

The population was 3,734 at the 2010 census.United States Census Bureau, American FactFinder, 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011. The town's central settlement, where 605 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the Walpole census-designated place (CDP), and is east of New Hampshire Route 12. The town also includes the villages of North Walpole and Drewsville.  History  The town was first granted in 1736 by Colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts as \\"Number 3\\", third in a line of Connecticut River fort towns. It was settled as early as 1736, and called \\"Great Falls\\" or \\"Lunenburg\\". Colonel Benjamin Bellows, for whom Bellows Falls, Vermont, is named, built a large fort here for defense against Indian attack. After the border between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was fixed (with Number 3 on the New Hampshire side of the line), the town was regranted by Governor Benning Wentworth as \\"Bellowstown\\", after its founder. It was incorporated in 1756. The grant was renewed in 1761, when the town was renamed \\"Walpole\\", in honor of Sir Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, and first Prime Minister of Great Britain. The first bridge across the Connecticut River, an engineering feat in its day, was built at Walpole in 1785, and is regarded as one of the most famous early spans in the United States. The town contains many architecturally significant old houses, including several associated with Colonel Bellows and members of his family. Walpole Academy, built in 1831 and attributed to master-builder Aaron Prentiss Howland, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The abundant lilacs in the town inspired Louisa May Alcott to write the 1878 book Under the Lilacs. The Alcott family moved to Walpole temporarily beginning in the summer of 1855 after Benjamin Willis, brother-in-law of matriarch Abby May Alcott, offered the family rent-free use of his home. Louisa was the first to move there and called the town \\"a lovely place, high among the hills\\". Her father Amos Bronson Alcott was initially happy with his hardworking neighbors there and wrote, \\"'Tis refreshing to yoke one's idealism with this team of tug-along-the-rut of realism, and so get practical wisdom out of it, and sanity.\\" Louisa eventually moved to Boston for the summer and her sister Anna took a teaching job in Syracuse, New York. With his family split, Bronson came to dislike his experience in Walpole and found it difficult, as he wrote, \\"to make the most of myself and them in this little river town and its quiet population\\". Abby had been working with one of the town's poorest families and from them the Alcott contracted smallpox. In the fall of 1857, the family moved to Concord, Massachusetts to live in the home they named Orchard House.Matteson, John. Eden's Outcasts: The Story of Louisa May Alcott and Her Father.

Westmoreland is historically an agricultural town, with much arable farmland. History Once known as Great Meadow, this town was first granted in 1735 by Governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts as Number 2, second in a line of Connecticut River fort towns designed to protect the colonies from Indian attack. This part of the river was a favorite Indian campsite, and the settlers who came beginning in 1741 were several times victims of attack. When the border between Massachusetts and the Province of New Hampshire was fixed (with Number 2 on the New Hampshire side), the town was regranted in 1752 by Governor Benning Wentworth as Westmoreland, named for John Fane, 7th Earl of Westmorland. The Park Hill Meetinghouse, built in 1762, has a Paul Revere bell.

But it is tourism that brought fame and prosperity to the area. Hannah and Abel Crawford turned their log cabin into an inn, then built The Notch House in 1828. In 1874, the Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad reached Fabyan Station, an important junction joined the next year by the Portland & Ogdensburg Railroad. Here stood the Fabyan House, a grand hotel built by Sylvester Marsh and his colleagues, who also built the nearby Mount Washington Cog Railway.Sylvester Marsh and the Mount Washington Railway The hotel burned in 1951. The Mount Pleasant House was built in 1875, although demolished in 1939. But the grandest of all was the Mount Washington Hotel, built in 1902 and still operating. Here was held the 1944 International Monetary Conference, which resulted in the creation of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. =Zealand= Zealand was a logging community within Carroll, established by James Everell Henry (1831‚Äì1912) circa 1880. By 1884, Henry had started the Zealand Valley Railroad, which would extend about into the forest. Zealand was a company town with various buildings including a boarding house, store, engine house, and a post office that operated from 1883 to 1897. After much lumber had been removed through clearcutting, Henry moved his operations to Lincoln in 1892. George Van Dyke then leased land and the Zealand mill from Henry, and constructed the Little River Railroad in 1893. Following a major fire in May 1897, and the removal of most remaining lumber, the railroad and ultimately Zealand were abandoned circa 1900. It is commemorated by a New Hampshire historical marker (number 233), installed in Carroll in 2013. A few remnants of the Zealand community can still be found.

The population was 5,321 at the 2010 census. It became a village in 1949 and a city in 1973. Falcon Heights is the home of the University of Minnesota's St. Paul Campus; the Gabbert Raptor Center and Les Bolstad Golf Course, the Minnesota State Fairgrounds, and the Gibbs Museum of Pioneer and Dakotah Life. Its University Grove neighborhood is known for its modern architecture. History Heman Gibbs settled in the 1850s near the modern intersection of Cleveland and Larpenteur Avenues. His homestead is on the National Register of Historic Places and his home is a county museum. On September 2, 1901, then-Vice President Theodore Roosevelt first publicly used the African proverb \\"Speak softly and carry a big stick\\" in a speech at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds, which was still a part of St. Paul at the time. Roosevelt became president just two weeks later, upon the assassination of William McKinley, and built the phrase into his concept of Big Stick Diplomacy. Snelling and Larpenteur Avenues in 1920 Between the 1910s and 1930s, Curtiss Northwest Airport was located at the intersection of Snelling and Larpenteur Avenues. The airfield was important in Minnesota aviation history, hosting Charles Lindbergh, Speed Holman, and Phoebe Fairgrave. Part of the land is now a city park named Curtiss Field. In the 1930s, a real estate agent named Faulkner developed land owned by a 3M executive and named this development‚ÄîFalcon Heights‚Äîafter himself. The first house arose in 1937. In 1949 residents rejected annexation by Roseville or St. Paul, and voted to incorporate themselves. The expanded Falcon Heights included the University of Minnesota Golf Course and Test Fields as well as the Minnesota State Fairgrounds. Two-thirds of Falcon Heights is public land, chiefly the university and state fair. Falcon Heights is where a legally armed 32-year-old African American man, Philando Castille was fatally shot by police, causing civil unrest, and calls for police reform and justice for the man, and for African Americans in general. Parks Falcon Heights Community Park and Curtiss Field have recreational sports in the summer for kids and an ice rink and warming house in the winter. The community park also has a soccer field and a fitness course. Grove Park, in University Grove, also has a temporary warming house and ice rink in the winter.

The population was 2,301 at the 2010 census.United States Census Bureau, American FactFinder, 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011. Situated in the Great North Woods Region, it is bounded on the west by the Connecticut River and home to Beaver Brook Falls Natural Area. The main village of the town, where 1,394 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the Colebrook census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 3 with New Hampshire Route 26. The town also includes the villages of Kidderville, Upper Kidderville, and Factory Village. Colebrook is part of the Berlin, NH‚àíVT Micropolitan Statistical Area. History First granted in 1762 by New Hampshire's Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, the territory was named \\"Dryden\\", after English poet and playwright John Dryden. Due to the inability of its original grantees to settle the remote area, however, it was regranted in 1770 by Colonial Governor John Wentworth, who renamed it \\"Colebrook Town\\" after Sir George Colebrooke, the East India Company's chairman of the board. It was settled that same year by a single family by the name of Rosebrook, but the family was driven out by the Revolutionary War, and further settlement did not occur until after the war's end.Granvyl Hulse, \\"The Early History of Colebrook\\" (lecture series), 2007 The 1790 census recorded a population of 29, and the town was incorporated as Colebrook on June 11, 1796. For many years, it was the shire town of the Northern Judicial District of Coos County. Today, it has a district branch of the Lancaster Superior Court. A conflicting account holds that the town \\"was originally called Coleburne and was granted to Sir George Colebrook and others. It was incorporated June 11, 1795.\\"Article in Statistics and Gazetteer of New-Hampshire (1875) The first road through the town was known as River Road, taking a route that is roughly followed today by U.S. Route 3, the Daniel Webster Highway. The first surveyed lots in the town comprised about each, running from River Road to the Connecticut River. Settlement then proceeded up two new roads, Titus Hill Road and what is now Pleasant Street. Titus Hill leads southeast out of the town center up to high ground in the neighboring town of Columbia that supports farming, while Pleasant Street, now a short road in Colebrook village, led east up the valley of the Mohawk River (now the route of New Hampshire Route 26) to the area of East Colebrook, the present-day village of Kidderville, and what was known as \\"Factory Village\\", which grew about east of the present village of Colebrook around a woolen mill constructed in 1816. In 1803, seven years after the incorporation of the town, historian Timothy Dwight wrote, \\"Everything in this township exhibits the activity and enterprise of its inhabitants; their roads, plantations, barns and schoolhouses are well built. Their dwelling houses are principally of logs; but they are beginning to form better, and will soon be lodged very comfortable. Mills they have already.\\" The first sawmill and gristmill in the town were constructed around 1800 by Andrew McAllaster and his son, William, on the west side of the Beaver Brook bridge on what is now Main Street (Route 3) at the north end of the present village. The first brick maker was the Loomis kiln, located north of the current village approximately where the IGA grocery store now stands. A larger brickmaker, Pratt & Smith, constructed a large kiln about 1826 in the Factory Village area. In 1822 a new brick woolen mill was constructed in Factory Village along the Mohawk River and produced at its peak of finished wool per year. It was capable of producing of cloth per day, including flannel and blankets. What is now Colebrook village, located on the eastern edge of the Connecticut River bottomlands where the Mohawk River enters, began to grow in the decade following 1811, when the Walker House was constructed at the corner of present-day Main and Pleasant streets. Commercial buildings began to appear in 1816 on the block of Main Street between Pleasant Street and Parsons Street. The area was noted for excellent farming soil. After the Coos Trail through Dixville Notch was created in 1803, farmers loaded sleds each winter with potash, pearlash, wheat and other produce, including potato whiskey, to exchange in Portland, Maine, for molasses, saltfish and other necessities. According to the 1874 Gazetteer, Colebrook was the Potato Capital of New Hampshire, producing over 120,000 bushels per year, most of which were milled into potato starch. Some were distilled into \\"potato whiskey.\\" This industry dated back to 1848, when Sherburn R. Merrill bought land in Factory Village along the Mohawk River to build a starch mill, originally with 150 tons capacity. Other starch factories soon followed. At its peak, the town was producing, according to James O. Adams in 1877, \\"approximately one third of the potato starch in the state. Considered another way, one twentieth of all the starch produced in the United States came from the Colebrook area during this period.\\" The starch industry began to decline after 1880, due to lack of fertilization in the area's potato farms. Gradually, the area turned to dairy farming. Abundant regional forests helped Colebrook become a lumbering center, with the first sawmill established at Beaver Brook in 1800. Between 1868 and 1915, the town was witness to great log drives. Other local manufacturing businesses, including blacksmiths, bobbin mills, boot- and shoemakers, carriage shops, cheesemakers, and tanneries, grew in the area through the 1800s, until the arrival of the railroad in 1887 connected the town to larger suppliers of goods. Tourism has been a growing component of Colebrook's economy since the 19th century. As early as 1804, an inn was constructed by the McAllaster family on what is now North Main Street. Chamberlain's Tavern was built in 1816 and was for a time the meeting place of the town's militia; it is now the Jenkins/Jacoby Funeral Home. Three large hotels were built in Colebrook in the mid 1800s. The earliest was the Colebrook House, originally a large private home that was converted to an inn in the 1840s. After a series of conversions of use and two fires, a new hotel occupying the site was built in 1903 and still is in operation. The second hotel to be built in the town was the Parsons House (1862) on the south corner of Main and Parsons streets; it had a dining room that could seat 125 guests. The Parsons House burned in 1890 and was not rebuilt. The Monadnock House, built in the late 1860s, burned in 1895 and was replaced with a new structure that had 70 guest rooms. By the late 1940s, it had been sold to the Daughters of Charity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus for a convent and boarding school. In 1971 it was sold to the town of Colebrook, and the building was torn down in 1977. During the Gilded Age, a new grand hotel was planned for Colebrook. Called the Metallak after Native American chief Metallak, the imposing Victorian structure was designed by architect John Calvin Stevens, and intended to attract tourists arriving by railroad to escape the summer heat and pollution in big cities. Construction began on Lombard's Hill, but a violent windstorm in April 1893 destroyed the frame, and investors abandoned the project. Stevens then reused the building's scheme, while reducing its size by two-fifths, to become the Bay of Naples Inn at Naples, Maine, which opened in 1899. Although the Metallak itself was never finished, its extensive plans are preserved among the architect's papers at the Maine Historical Society, making the ill-fated Colebrook hotel perhaps the most thoroughly documented design of its type in the White Mountains. The Balsams Grand Resort Hotel was built in neighboring Dixville Notch in 1874. The resort's golf course is located on land in Colebrook that overlooks the notch and the hotel. Another hotel, the Hampshire Inn, was located on the Colebrook/Columbia town line and enjoyed a heyday in the 1890s and 1900s. The building was demolished in the 1970s, and the land was part of the Shrine of Our Lady of Grace along U.S. Route 3, which itself closed in July 2014. Serial killer Christopher Wilder's nationwide murder spree ended at a Colebrook gas station on April 13, 1984, when two New Hampshire state troopers attempted to apprehend him, but in a scuffle Wilder shot and killed himself as well as seriously wounding one of the troopers.

The population was 1,118 at the 2010 census. It is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 110. The paper mill, which was the primary employer in Groveton, was closed by Wausau Papers in 2008. Groveton is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area. History =Fort Wentworth= Fort Wentworth was a colonial fort built in 1755 at the junction of the Upper Ammonoosuc River and Connecticut River, in Northumberland, New Hampshire, just downstream from the present site of Groveton. =Paper mill= Diamond International Papers was originally the hub of Groveton. Diamond International was replaced by James River Paper Company, which was followed by Wausau Paper. In 2008 Wausau ceased production in its Groveton mill, which in turn precluded the trains from stopping in Groveton any more. There were plans to turn the mill into a biomass plant, but as of January 2012, plans for buying the mill had fallen through. After an interview with former mill employees, the Town of Northumberland has decided to demolish the mill for scrap metals. With the price of metals at an all-time high, the town would make more money with the metals than waiting for the mill to sell. Plans for the future site include a LNG Plant bringing 80 or so vital jobs to the North Country. As of late 2014 the plans are on hold. =Steam locomotive= A coal- powered steam engine was owned by the Odell Manufacturing Company paper mill for use as a switch engine. Having last seen use in the mid-1960s, it is presently maintained by Wausau Mills and Groveton Paper Board. The community beautification committee \\"dresses it up\\" every Christmas and keep it clean. =Riverside Speedway and Adventure Park= In 1964 Riverside Speedway, a 1/4 mile banked oval track, opened in Groveton.

It is home to parts of the White Mountain National Forest in the south and northeast and to Santa's Village, a Christmas-themed amusement park. There are also several private campgrounds, motels and inns. Jefferson is part of the Berlin, New Hampshire-Vermont Micropolitan Statistical Area.  History  Carter's Tower in 1906 Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth first made land grants in this area in 1765, but the location was so deep in unexplored territory that few settlers took up their claims. So soon after the French and Indian War, in which certain Native American tribes in New England were allied with the French, English colonists did not want to be exposed on the frontier. Colonel Joseph Whipple (1738‚Äì1816) took a grant and cut trails through the forests to build a \\"manor\\" house. He named the town \\"Dartmouth\\" after William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, the patron of Dartmouth College. Brother to William Whipple, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Colonel Whipple renamed the town \\"Jefferson\\" four years prior to Thomas Jefferson's election as president. The state legislature granted the town a new charter as \\"Jefferson\\" in 1796. In the mid-19th century, the boundary with the adjacent township of Kilkenny was moved so as to include that township's few residents in Jefferson. Cherry Mountain from the Waumbek Hotel, c. 1910 Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, a local farm boy born in 1832, became a world-famous inventor of aerostats (dirigibles) and other devices. Consulting President Abraham Lincoln, he organized a balloon corps during the Civil War, and went on to invent the ice-making machine, and later the water-gas process. For years, the latter was used to fuel gas lights in hundreds of cities. His father, Clovis Lowe, had been part owner in 1832 of nearby Low and Burbank's Grant, which contains much of Mount Adams and Mount Madison. Lowe is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 19) in Jefferson. In 1885, a landslide on the north side of Cherry Mountain demolished the Stanley farm, mortally wounding a worker. Local hotels immediately arranged daily excursions to view the scene, now marked by a New Hampshire historical marker (number 152) titled \\"Cherry Mountain Slide\\". Jefferson's third marker (number 229) honors Deborah Vicker, known as \\"Granny Stalbird\\", who is said to have brought the first bible to the north country. The Waumbek c. 1905 During the early 1900s, Jefferson was a popular summer resort, boasting one of the largest \\"grand hotels\\" in the White Mountains‚Äîthe Waumbek, with accommodations for nearly 300 guests. The hotel had its own rail branch, to deliver guests directly to the hotel from Boston and New York without changing trains. It was destroyed by fire on May 9, 1928. At tourism's peak, Jefferson had over 30 inns and boarding houses, accessible by several mainline depots, including Riverton, Baileys, Meadows, and Highlands. Some of the original station buildings remain, although most have been moved to nearby locations. The tracks were removed in the 1920s. The wider ownership of automobiles gave people more choices for vacation destinations, and the Great Depression reduced vacations for years. By the end of this period, many people sought other venues than grand hotels. A number of historic, architecturally interesting structures remain from the resort era. The Waumbek Cottages provided a backdrop for the popular White Mountains Festival of the Arts until 1979. In March 2006, the Waumbek Cottages Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1988 and 1989, Jefferson gained national attention when a local volunteer firefighter was charged and tried in connection with dozens of arson fires that had plagued the area.

The population was 134 at the 2010 census. Saint Louis County Highway 133 (CR 133), County 5 (CR 5), and County 29 (CR 29) are three of the main routes in Meadowlands. History Meadowlands, as its name would suggest, is one of the few areas of arable land in Saint Louis County. While Meadowlands prospered and grew due to the support it provided to the region's farms, the steady decline in those same farms (and the large families they supported) during the mid-late 1980s and early 1990s heralded the beginning of the town's gradual decline. During its heyday, Meadowlands was home to a number of businesses including a Ford dealership (which also carried New Holland farm machinery), a bank, a farmer's cooperative store, a grocery store, a commercial laundry, a cheese factory, various restaurants, a movie theater and the Toivola‚ÄìMeadowlands School, a K‚Äì12 institution. However, the loss of the large farm families gradually reduced the student population until Independent School District 710 chose to close the school. An attempt was made to covert T‚ÄìM into a \\"Charter School\\", but it ultimately proved unsuccessful. Before closing, the school sent its 9-man football team to the Minnesota State Finals twice in the 1980s. Currently it possesses only a single bar/grill establishment, and four places of worship. The retail and service related facilities have seen a slight increase in business due to the recent expansion of tourism related to bird-watching. The rivers, lakes, fields and arboreal bog areas around Meadowlands offer visitors the opportunity to view species ranging from small song birds, such as the waxwing, to Bald Eagles. Also winter brings with it increased snowmobile traffic, as a former Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railroad line runs along the eastern edge of the town.

It is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area. It was named for the city of Milan in Italy.  History  Milan village in the 19th century Originally named Paulsburg in 1771 after Paul Wentworth, the town was incorporated on December 16, 1824. In that year, Governor Levi Woodbury authorized a name change to Milan, in honor of Milan Harris. Prior to 1820 there were but few inhabitants. In 1819 the population was about fourteen; ten years passed and the number had increased four-fold. Like the other towns around it, Milan's first industries were lumbering operations, and agriculture was for some time subordinate to this. The firms farms were developed on Milan hill. The soil was warmer, more free from frost, and, for some years, produced quite liberally in response to the labors of the pioneers. But they were not permanently as productive as they gave promise, and many of those settlers who remained south the most valuable lands along the river. Some of the names of the early pioneers of Milan include Ellingwood, Hodgdon, Fogg, Hinds, Roberts, Hagar, Sargent, Nay, Twitchell, and Newell.

Pierz described the Sauk River Valley as a \\"land flowing with milk and honey\\" as well as safe from disease and anti-Catholic oppression.

It is the northernmost town in New Hampshire and the largest town by area in New England. U.S. Route 3 is the only major highway in the town, although the northern terminus of New Hampshire Route 145 also lies within Pittsburg. Pittsburg is part of the Berlin, New Hampshire‚ÄìVermont Micropolitan Statistical Area.  History  Pittsburg derives its name from William Pitt, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Prior to its incorporation in 1840, the area was settled c. 1810 and known as the Territory of Indian Stream. It had the unique distinction of having been its own microstate briefly during the 1830s, called the Republic of Indian Stream, due to an ambiguous boundary between the United States and Canada.  Geography  Pittsburg shares an international border with Qu√©bec province, Canada to its west and north, and borders the states of Maine (to the east) and Vermont (a very small portion to the southwest). Directly to the south is Clarksville. Pittsburg is the only New Hampshire municipality to border Canada, the only one that borders both Maine and Vermont, the only one to share a land border with Vermont, and the only town entirely north of the 45th parallel. Pittsburg contains the only part of New Hampshire west of the Connecticut River, as that river defines the Vermont state line from Clarksville southward. The Pittsburg‚ÄìChartierville Border Crossing, New Hampshire's only Canadian border crossing, is located in the town, at the northern terminus of U.S. Route 3. The western edge of Pittsburg is defined by Halls Stream, being the \\"northwesternmost headwaters of the Connecticut River\\", which defined (ambiguously) the border in the Treaty of Paris of 1783. Contained within the boundaries of Pittsburg are the Connecticut Lakes, which form the beginning of the Connecticut River. Early maps (e.g. 1854) also show several grants that were incorporated into the eastern edge of Pittsburg, including Carlisle No. 1, Webster/Carlisle No. 2 and Hubbards No. 3, all north of Atkinson and Gilmanton Academy Grant. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , the largest of any municipality incorporated as a town in both New Hampshire and New England. A total of is land and is water, the latter comprising 3.37% of the town. The highest point in Pittsburg is the summit of Stub Hill, at above sea level.

Tourism Looking south across Back Lake, August 2019 Pittsburg is a destination for snowmobile and ATV enthusiasts year round. In the winter months thousands of people visit Pittsburg to take advantage of the state-funded and club-supported and maintained trails that can bring snowmobilers from elsewhere in the state of New Hampshire to Pittsburg, with access to the states of Maine, Vermont and the border crossing to Canada. Some of the same trails are used in the summer for ATVs. Another focus in the area for tourists is fishing and hunting. Pittsburg is home to the four Connecticut Lakes, Back Lake, part of Lake Francis, and numerous smaller water bodies. The lakes are annually stocked with fish and allow for fishing weekends. The area is known for fly fishing. Two sections of the Connecticut River are fly fishing only, including the \\"Trophy Stretch\\". The Connecticut Lakes Region has attracted anglers and hunters since the early 1900s. There are maps on the local snowmobile club's website that show trails in Pittsburg as well as roads and access points to the lakes and rivers. Lake Francis State Park allows for lakeside camping, fishing, and canoeing on the lake or the Connecticut River. Deer Mountain Campground enables camping and picnicking on the Connecticut River.

There are no trails maintained to the top of Black Crescent Mountain or Pond Hill. The highest point in Randolph is on the town's southern border, atop a knob on Howker Ridge, a spur of Mount Madison. The settled part of Randolph is divided into two main areas: Randolph \\"valley\\", where town hall is, and Randolph Hill, which has several roads all connected to a main road called Randolph Hill Road. Randolph Hill has the site of the Mt. Crescent House (hotel), which opened in 1883 as the \\"Randolph Hill House\\" and was torn down in 1971. Randolph also had \\"Ravine House\\" on Durand Road, straight north of the Appalachia trailhead.

Many houses in Randolph are summer/vacation homes. Historically, vacationers tended to visit the hotels, reachable by horse-drawn carriage from the Randolph train station; but as the automobile became more popular, the hotels declined and private vacation homes became more prevalent. Vacationing in the far north was particularly advantageous before the air conditioner became common, as Randolph summers are rarely very hot‚Äîand never hot at all in the higher mountain areas. The town has a strong group of people who spent entire summers there during the Depression and World War II era. These people all know each other well, and many have retired there. As they age and die off, though, the younger generation of vacationers, who can no longer afford six-week vacations, are less tightly knit.  Recreation  Randolph sign, seen when entering Randolph on U.S. Route 2 from the east or west. Randolph is located in a mountainous region that attracts hikers. Because of this, the RMC (Randolph Mountain Club) was formed (see subsection below). The Randolph town sign (when entering and leaving Randolph through U.S. Route 2) is a picture of a person hiking. In some ways, this is the logo of Randolph. Trails in Randolph include the Mt. Crescent trail (leading to the top of Mt. Crescent), the Pasture Path, Grassy Lane, the Carlton Notch Trail, and many others. In 2003 a large section of the forest was turned into the Randolph Community Forest, which extends into the town of Jefferson. Wildlife in Randolph includes moose, deer, foxes, porcupines, snakes, and bears. =Randolph Mountain Club= The Randolph Mountain Club (or RMC) is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1910 and incorporated in 1915 by John H. Boothman. As of 2017, there were over 750 members. The mission of the RMC is \\"to promote the enjoyment of the Randolph area through hiking, trail development and maintenance, upkeep of camps and shelters, and the sharing of the collective knowledge of its members.\\" The club maintains a network of trails in the town, including on the northern slopes of the Presidential Range of the White Mountains, within the inhabited sections of Randolph, and also on Mts. Randolph and Crescent. Many of the trails lie within the White Mountain National Forest or the Randolph Community Forest. In 2011, the RMC became a member of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and responsible for maintenance of a 2.2 mile long section of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, along the route of the Gulfside Trail between Edmands Col and Madison Spring Hut. The RMC finished work on the Four Soldiers Path in 2003, a path that connects with the Pasture Path and ends at the Pond of Safety, a pond where fugitive soldiers stayed during the American Revolution. (See RMC website). There are four \\"camps\\" or shelters maintained by the RMC, all located on the north slopes of Mt. Adams in the White Mountain National Forest: Gray Knob, Crag Camp, the Perch and the Log Cabin. Accommodations at the camps are first-come, first-served; the on-site caretaker collects fees from overnight guests. The Randolph Mountain Club also organizes social events. For instance, there is an annual tea on the Fourth of July, held in the Town of Randolph. There is also the Annual Picnic the third Saturday in August, held in Mossy Glen, accessed from Durand Road. The annual picnic is characterized by \\"The Charades.\\" These so-called \\"charades\\" are actually skits where words are acted out. The town is divided into 3 teams: Hill, Midlands, and Valley for these skits. Often there is also a \\"Mountain\\" team, consisting of RMC trail crew members and caretakers. Members of the teams prepare for a couple of weeks for the skits, choosing words, writing scripts, going to rehearsals. The picnic includes traditional round-singing. The Randolph Mountain Club typically organizes two hikes per week in July and August, one difficult and one easier. Some volunteer trail work trips are also organized. Many community members have helped to maintain the trails. The RMC is led by a volunteer board of directors and many other regular volunteers drawn from the year-round and seasonal residents of Randolph, and from among other members. Employment opportunities with the club include summer jobs on the trail crew, and camp caretaker positions year-round. On the occasion of its centennial in 2010, the RMC published \\"Peaks and Paths: A Century of the Randolph Mountain Club\\" by Judith Maddock Hudson, a longtime member of the Club and currently its historian. = Swimming = There are two artificial lakes (or ponds) in Randolph; one is called Durand Lake and is present year round, while the other is known as the Ravine House Pool. The latter exists only in summer when it is created by damming up a mountain stream. The Ravine House Pool was previously used by the Ravine House, a defunct hotel, for swimming. There is still a small sandy beach at the pool, a dressing house, a water fountain, a raft, and a lifeguard station. There is also a playground area with swing set, slide, and small climbing structure nearby. = Tennis = There are tennis courts near the Ravine House Pool, and also a table top tennis club on Randolph Hill Road.

Geography  In New Hampshire, locations, grants, purchases, and townships (which are different from towns) are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self- government (if any, as many are uninhabited). The grant is bounded by the Maine border to the east, Atkinson and Gilmanton Academy Grant to the north, Dix's Grant to the west, and Wentworth's Location to the south. One of the other contemporaneous \\"Dartmouth\\" grants was to the north of Dixville but was annexed as the eastern end of Clarksville. According to the United States Census Bureau, the grant has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.22%, is water. The highest point is a knoll just west of Mount Tucker. The confluence of the Swift (left) and Dead (right) Diamond rivers Two rivers, the Dead Diamond and the Swift Diamond, flow through and join together in the Second College Grant.  History  In 1766, New Hampshire Governor John Wentworth promised Eleazar Wheelock a grant of a township on which to build Dartmouth College. In 1770, a month after Wheelock received the royal charter, the governor granted the college the township of Landaff (east of Woodsville, New Hampshire), but Wheelock, after viewing the land and others under consideration, decided to establish the college in Hanover. After the American Revolution the college lost its claim to Landaff in 1791, because of the grant‚Äôs royal derivation and rival claims by American settlers in Landaff. While the Landaff case underwent litigation to resolve the rival claims, Vermont (then meeting in Norwich) came to the aid of the college and granted it the township of Wheelock (northwest of St. Johnsbury) in 1785. The college divided the town into lots and leased these to settlers. Over the years the college has sold most of the lots to meet financial needs but still holds title to some properties in the town. In 1789, New Hampshire, anticipating the college‚Äôs loss of the Landaff Grant, made good on its original promise of a grant with the town of Clarksville (in northern New Hampshire). This is considered the First College Grant, as it was intended to replace the loss of the original Landaff Grant. The college sold most of this land in the first two years, and had sold off the rest by 1872. The sale of the Clarksville Grant properties proved to be inadequate, and the college petitioned the state for an additional grant in 1792. Several proposals were made in the legislature, but it wasn‚Äôt until 1807 that the state responded with the Second College Grant. The lands of the Second College Grant proved to be unattractive to settlers, but sale of timber provided a small but steady income to the college over the next century and a half. In 1947, Robert S. Monahan ‚Äô29 was hired as College Forester to oversee the College Grant, and since that time the multiple use philosophy of forest management has been formalized. As a result, the recreational and education concepts have become a prominent part of the Grant‚Äôs management with untold opportunities for use by the Dartmouth Family. In 1970, Monahan retired, and cutting operations were suspended while a committee, named by the Trustees of the College in 1968 in anticipation of Monahan‚Äôs retirement, evaluated the existing policies. The Prentiss & Carlisle Company of Bangor, Maine subsequently prepared a management plan which was transmitted to the College by the committee in early January 1970. This was adopted and referred to as the 10-20 Year Plan with provisions for an annual sustained yield cut of approximately 4,000 cords per year for the following twenty years. The Seven Islands Land Company of Bangor was retained by the College to oversee forestry management and to implement the Prentiss & Carlisle plan. It was at this same time that Al Merrill was named Director of Outdoor Affairs and given responsibility for recreational and educational use of the Second College Grant along with oversight of the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge and the Dartmouth Outing Club. In 1976 evidence of an increase in the spruce budworm had already reached epidemic proportions in Maine and Canada. In response to this blight, the College imposed a two-year moratorium on logging while a plan was developed. In 1978 the College implemented a salvage operation designed to remove the dead fir while saving as much spruce and hardwood as possible. The salvage operation lasted until 1986, at which time the remaining standing dead fir had decayed beyond use. Once again the harvesting activity was halted while the College took stock of its forest resources and considered its future management options. Seven Islands Land Company conducted a timber cruise survey and used the growth and inventory data to prepare a new 10-20 Year Management Plan. A consensus was reached that the College would be better served by having its own forester. A decision was then made to release Seven Islands Land company of its forest management responsibilities on the College Grant and to once again employ a College forester, Edward Witt. After carefully analyzing the data prepared by Seven Islands, Witt decided that the annual growth rate of the forest would allow for a sustainable annual cut of 6,000 cords. The forest plan was modified to allow harvesting as much as 10,000 cords for ten years in an effort to remove the poorer quality trees and improve the overall quality of the forest. This would be followed by several years of cutting lesser volumes but higher quality trees. Further, because the forest is managed for the benefit of wildlife, cutting operations were modified to reflect that policy. Since 1987, the forest has been managed accordingly with the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department actively involved in the location, design, and methodology of the harvesting activity.  Demographics  As of the 2010 census, there were no people living in the township. In 1930, there were 17 people living in the grant; the population has been less than 10 since then, with the last non-zero census figure being recorded in 1980.

Located near the geographical center of the state, Ashland is home to Scribner-Fellows State Forest. The main village of the town, where 1,244 people lived at the 2010 census, is defined as the Ashland census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 25 with NH Route 132. History Ashland was once the southwestern corner of Holderness, chartered in 1751 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. But hostilities during the French and Indian War delayed settlement, and in 1761, it was regranted as \\"New Holderness\\" (although \\"New\\" would be dropped in 1816). Settled in 1763, the town was predominantly agricultural except for Holderness Village on the Squam River, with falls that drop about before meeting the Pemigewasset River. The falls provided water power for mills, and in 1770‚Äì1771, a sawmill and gristmill were built. The Squam Lake Woolen Mill was established in 1840. Goods manufactured at local factories included hosiery, gloves, sporting equipment, wood products and paper. The Boston, Concord & Montreal RailroadArticle in Statistics and Gazetteer of New-Hampshire (1875) entered in 1849, carrying freight but also tourists bound for hotels on the Squam Lakes, to which they traveled by steamer up the Squam River. The interests of the industrialized settlement increasingly diverged from those of the farming community, however, and in 1868 Holderness Village was set off as Ashland, named for Ashland, the Kentucky estate of Henry Clay. The last textile mill, the L.W. Packard Company, would close in 2002, and Ashland is today a residential and resort community.

Bath before the 1872 fire A disastrous fire swept through Bath village on 1 February 1872, destroying the Congregational church, Bath Hotel and several dwelling houses. The church was rebuilt in 1873.Article in Statistics and Gazetteer of New-Hampshire (1875) By 1874, Bath was served by the Boston, Concord and Montreal and White Mountains (N.H.) Railroad. But nearby Woodsville developed into a major railroad junction, and the region's commercial center shifted there. By 1886, once thriving Bath was described as in decay. But this economic dormancy of the Victorian era preserved much early architecture in the village, particularly in the Federal and Greek Revival styles. The Brick Store, built in 1824, is today the oldest continuously operating general store in the United States.Grafton County Heritage Sites  Bath, New Hampshire The Moses P. Payson Mansion (1810), designed by Alexander Parris, once dominated the town center. But fire and neglect took a heavy toll; it is being dismantled for architectural salvage.

The eastern half of the town is within the White Mountain National Forest. The Appalachian Trail crosses in the south. The main village of the town, where 972 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the Bethlehem census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 302 with New Hampshire Route 142. The town also includes the villages of Maplewood and Pierce Bridge.  History  Panoramic Map of Bethlehem in 1883 Granted as \\"Lloyd's Hills\\" in 1774 by Colonial Governor John Wentworth, the town was named for James Lloyd of Boston. It was the last of the provincial grants in New Hampshire. In the aftermath of the Revolutionary War, the original grant could not be found. Lack of documentation deterred settlement until 1787, when the first permanent houses were built. Dropping its homage to Lloyd, a Loyalist, the town was incorporated as \\"Bethlehem\\" on December 27, 1799, the name having been selected on Christmas Day. There were just 33 families, with agriculture the only industry. By 1850, the population had grown to 950, and the town contained a gristmill, five large sawmills, and two starch factories. In 1867, the railroad came to Bethlehem Junction. With it traveled tourists from Boston, New York and elsewhere, many to avoid respiratory ailments in the low pollen count environment of \\"the highest town in New Hampshire\\" (as claimed on a present-day sign in the village). Others were attracted by the paintings of the White Mountain artists. Conveniently located near Mount Washington and other attractions of the White Mountains, Bethlehem developed into a Gilded Age resort for the rich and famous. The Maplewood Hotel c. 1905 In 1873, at the beginning of a building boom, Governor Henry Howard of Rhode Island built Howard House. Eventually, over 30 hotels would line Bethlehem's streets. Seven trains arrived daily, some direct from Grand Central Terminal, stopping at Bethlehem's five depots. Patrons included Presidents Grant, Hayes, Roosevelt, Taft and Harding, as well as author Thornton Burgess and poet Robert Frost. Entertainments included strolling Main Street on a two and a half mile raised boardwalk, carriage rides in the countryside, croquet games or simply lounging about the hotels' sweeping piazzas. On the hills and thoroughfares were built large summer \\"cottages\\", including that of the Woolworth family. Beginning in 1887, an annual Coaching Parade was held, with prizes awarded for lavishly decorated horse-drawn carriages. Ornamentations cost as much as $5,000, prompting visitor Phineas T. Barnum to proclaim it \\"the Second Greatest Show on Earth.\\" But the rise of the automobile would bring the decline of grand hotels. Tourists could now explore regions beyond the limits of rail service. Beginning about 1916, Jewish families began arriving in town, often seeking relief from hay fever symptoms. In fact, an organization named the Hebrew Hay Fever Relief Association, which was organized in the 1920s, existed in Bethlehem for many years.The New Hampshire Atlas and Gazetteer. (1988). Freeport, ME: DeLorme Mapping Company. See Map 44.The Bethlehem Landfill Controversy WhiteMountainNews.com June 20, 2010 For a town in northern New Hampshire, contemporary Bethlehem has a sizeable Jewish community (and a number of synagogues), a legacy of its hay-fever-relief experience. It was at Bethlehem that the National Hay Fever Relief Association was founded. World War II gave the hotels a second life, as tourists avoided war-ravaged Europe and stayed closer to home. By the 1950s, however, hotel attendance had dwindled. Many would close and be demolished. Today, the town is known for its special Christmas postal cancellation stamp. Every year, people from all over the world send Christmas cards to the Bethlehem post office to have them postmarked. In 2000, it handled 56,000 Christmas cards. Bethlehem has experienced a continuing controversy, beginning in the 1980s. Casella Waste Systems of Rutland, Vermont, through its subsidiary North Country Environmental Services, purchased the town dump and created a landfill. The company has made efforts to expand the landfill. Town residents have tried to terminate the landfill, but Casella has repeatedly challenged the residents in court.

The population was 3,909 at the 2010 census. It is the location of Mascoma State Forest. Canaan is home to the Cardigan Mountain School, the town's largest employer. The main village of the town, where 524 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the Canaan census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 4 with New Hampshire Route 118. History Chartered in 1761 by Governor Benning Wentworth, the town was named after the hometown of many early settlers, Canaan, Connecticut, which had been named by Puritans for the biblical land of Canaan. It was settled in the winter of 1766-1767 by John Scofield, who arrived with all his belongings on a hand sled. The land was filled with rocks, making agriculture difficult. The town constructed a broad road for its main street on a stretch of level land. In 1828 attorney George Kimball helped organize building the town's Congregational church. He was among the New England abolitionists who founded Noyes Academy in March 1835, one of the first schools in the region to admit students of all races. It opened with 28 white students, drawn largely from local families, and 17 black students; most of the latter came from outside the town and across the Northeast. Many local residents opposed bringing blacks into the town. On August 10, 1835, five hundred white men from Canaan and nearby towns used \\"nearly 100 yoke of oxen\\" to pull the building off its foundation, then burned it. Fearing for their safety, the black students left town, as did Kimball, who moved to Alton, Illinois.Child (1886), pp. 73 and 234 Canaan Union Academy was built on the site and was limited to white students; it operated for the next 20 years. After the Academy's closing, residents sympathetic to fugitive slaves operated a station of the Underground Railroad to help the people reach Canada or settle in New England. The Northern Railroad (predecessor of the Boston & Maine Railroad) was constructed to the town in 1847, spurring development. Water powered mills were built on the streams. By 1859, the population had reached 1,682, and Canaan had one gristmill, three lath and clapboard mills, and one tannery. Canaan was the site of a famous train wreck on September 15, 1907. Four miles west of Canaan Station, the southbound Quebec to Boston express, crowded with passengers returning from the Sherbrooke Fair, collided head-on with a northbound Boston & Maine freight train.

History Named after President Grover Cleveland, the town began formation in 1869 as people moved inland from the Mississippi River. The Louisville, New Orleans & Texas Railroad ran through the town and a portion of the railroad remains there today. Early records show the community was called Fontaine in 1884 and at some point Coleman's Station. Moses W. Coleman built the first home on the bayou in the area. In 1885, it was officially named Sims after Rueben T. Sims, who owned part of the land on which the town stood. The village of Cleveland was chartered on March 25, 1886, and the United States Post Office recognized the town as such on August 5, 1887. It was Sims's son, B.C. Sims, who was responsible for the name change to Cleveland. In 1967, Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Joseph S. Clark, Jr. began Senate hearings to assess the effectiveness of the War on Poverty programs. The first field hearings were held in Jackson, Mississippi, and the following day Kennedy and Clark set out to visit \\"pockets of poverty\\" in the Mississippi Delta. They arrived in Cleveland, along with Marian Wright and Peter Edelman, for a tour conducted by Amzie Moore. There they observed barefoot, underfed African-American children in tattered clothing, with vacant expressions and distended bellies. Kennedy told Edelman that he thought he had seen the worst poverty in the nation in West Virginia, but it paled in comparison to the poverty he observed in Cleveland.

Set in the White Mountains, Franconia is home to the northern half of Franconia Notch State Park. Parts of the White Mountain National Forest are in the eastern and southern portions of the town. The Appalachian Trail crosses the southern part. History quarter The town was first granted in 1764 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth as Franconia,The Franconia Charter, 1764 a name widely applied to the region by 1760Herbert, Phyllis Bond. The Early History of Franconia, N.H., p. 6 due to the terrain's resemblance to the Franconian Switzerland in the region of Franconia in Germany. Upon claims that a settlement was not made within the time prescribed under the terms of the charter, it was regranted in 1772 by his nephew, Governor John Wentworth, as Morristown. Sometime between 1779 and 1782, after a legal battle over the two grants, the first grant was recognized and the original name of the town was resumed.Welch, Sarah Nelson. A History of Franconia New Hampshire, p. 32Franconia Area Heritage Council. Old Landmarks of Our Neighborhood, p. 32. The town sits on a rich iron deposit, and the region once produced pig iron and bar iron for farm tools and cast iron ware. Franconia is home to the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway, which rises to the summit of Cannon Mountain. Built in 1938, it was the first passenger aerial tramway in North America. From the time of its construction in 1938 to its retirement in 1980, the original tramway carried 6,581,338 passengers to the summit of Cannon Mountain. The original tramway was replaced by a new 80-passenger tram in 1979. Construction and testing of the new tram were completed in February 1980, and the red and yellow tram cars are still running year-round today. Around 1940, actress Bette Davis vacationed in Sugar Hill, the town bordering Franconia to the west. On a solo hike to Bridal Veil Falls at the western foot of Cannon Mountain, she got lost in the woods. Arthur Farnsworth, who worked at Peckett's Ski School, found her and rescued her from the woods. They fell in love and soon married. Farnsworth died unexpectedly as a result of freak accident in Los Angeles. Davis had erected in a rock on the trail to Bridal Veil Falls a plaque to commemorate Farnsworth, in which was inscribed the words \\"The Keeper of Stray Ladies,\\" although Davis did not include her name in the plaque. The plaque can be seen today on the Coppermine Trail to Bridal Veil Falls. The town was home to Franconia College during the 1960s and 1970s.

Southaven is traversed from north to south by the I-55/I-69 freeway. The city's name derives from the fact that Southaven is located south of Whitehaven, a neighborhood in Memphis. History Southaven began as a village when Memphis homebuilder Kemmons Wilson (founder of Holiday Inn) wished to develop a few residential subdivisions featuring small starter homes just across the Mississippi border from Whitehaven, Tennessee, an unincorporated suburb of Memphis. Whitehaven was eventually annexed by Memphis. Officially incorporated in 1980, Southaven is one of the fastest- growing cities in the southeastern United States. In just 20 years, Southaven doubled its land area, while its population tripled. The construction of Interstate 55 through Southaven in the 1970s helped to promote growth and make for easier access to the city from Memphis, Jackson, St. Louis, and Chicago. Interstate 69, which will eventually run from Canada to Mexico, was cosigned with I-55 in Southaven in 2007. In 1988, Baptist Hospital-DeSoto opened in Southaven as a two-story hospital. In 2001, Baptist DeSoto started an expansion project, nearly doubling the size of the hospital. In 2002, Baptist Hospital-DeSoto added an Outpatient Diagnostic Center and a Women's Center. In November 2006, Baptist DeSoto opened an eleven-story hospital tower that added 140 beds to the facility, allowing it to offer all private rooms. In addition, the new hospital tower added a new and expanded Emergency Department, more operating suites and space for future additions. It is the first high-rise building constructed in DeSoto County. The exponential growth of Memphis International Airport (2 miles north of the city limits) in the 1980s led to increased air traffic over Southaven. The city continues to see large amounts of air traffic from Memphis International Airport, as flight paths to both north/south runways lead directly over the city. October 2007 saw the opening of Southaven's first large-scale shopping mall, Southaven Towne Center, which is located just south of Goodman Road between I-55/I-69 and Airways Boulevard.

Government Grafton is governed by a three-person select board. Politics Grafton was once an active hub for libertarians in the Free State Project. Grafton's appeal as a favorable destination was due to its absence of zoning laws and a very low property tax rate. Grafton County, within which the town of Grafton resides, ranks number 100 in terms of highest property taxes levied in the United States. As of 2019, Grafton itself has the 16th highest property tax rate in the state of New Hampshire. Grafton was the focus of the \\"Free Town Project\\", a movement begun by members of the Free State Project that sought to encourage libertarians to move to the town. Despite the fact that the project became defunct after controversy between organizers and local residents, many libertarians continue to move as part of the overall Free State Project. Since then, Grafton has become a center of libertarian activism with a strong focus on homesteading, marijuana legalization and agorism. Matt Hongoltz-Hetling's \\"A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear: The Utopian Plot to Liberate an American Town (and Some Bears)\\" documents how these policies led \\"twitchy\\" bears to overrun the town.

Woods operated a sawmill on the Ammonoosuc River, and developed a railroad supply enterprise following the establishment of the Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad. The village of Pike was settled by future employees of the Pike Manufacturing Company, which was once the world's leading manufacturer of whetstones. While the village of Haverhill Corner was historically considered to be the major settlement in town, the town's municipal offices are currently located in the village of North Haverhill, with Grafton County's offices and courthouse located just two miles farther north along Route 10. Woodsville served as the county seat until 1972, when the administrative offices relocated to rural land halfway between Woodsville and the smaller village of North Haverhill. The village of Woodsville is now the commercial center of Haverhill and its smaller surrounding towns, including several in Vermont. Woodsville is home to the town's supermarkets, pharmacies, banks (including the headquarters of the regional Woodsville Guaranty Savings Bank), state liquor store, and most of its restaurants and chain stores, although a few are located in North Haverhill.

Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, founder of the colony of Louisiana, left a more detailed account from an expedition of this region in 1700. The first detailed account comes from Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, younger brother of Iberville, whom the Pascagoula visited at Fort Maurepas in present-day Ocean Springs, shortly after it was settled and while the older brother was away in France. There are few details that are certain about these people, except that their language seemed not to have shared an etymological root with the larger native groups to the north, the Choctaw particularly. Instead, their language seems more akin to that of the Biloxi, who have been linked in this way to the Sioux, Crow, and Ho-Chunk. The territory of the Biloxi people seems to have ranged from the areas of what are now called Biloxi Bay to Bayou La Batre (Alabama) and up the Pascagoula River, and the Pascagoula people's territory seems to have ranged between some distance north of there to the confluence of the Leaf and Chickasawhay rivers.Cain, Cyril Edward: Four Centuries on the Pascagoula, Vol. 1 (1953) The first European settlers of Pascagoula were Jean Baptiste Baudreau Dit Graveline, Joseph Simon De La Pointe and his aunt, Madame Chaumont. =Modern history= The region changed hands over the next century, being occupied variously by the English, French, and Spanish until well after the American Revolutionary War. It did not come into the permanent possession of the United States until 1812 when it was added to the Mississippi Territory. At one point, for 74 days in 1810, Pascagoula was a part of what was known as the Republic of West Florida. Pascagoula was incorporated as a village in 1892 and obtained city status in 1901. Today's downtown Pascagoula used to be the town of Scranton, Mississippi (incorporated in 1870) until the two towns merged in 1912. In October 1973, an alleged unidentified flying object sighting and alien abduction is said to have occurred when co-workers Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed they were abducted by aliens while fishing near Pascagoula. The incident, Pascagoula Abduction, earned substantial mass media attention. In June 2019, Pascagoula placed an historical marker near the alleged abduction site. =Hurricane Katrina= Houses destroyed or flooded by Hurricane Katrina On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina's storm surge devastated Pascagoula,\\"National Weather Service Forecast Office ‚Äì Mobile/Pensacola.\\" NOAA.

Nearly 92% of Pascagoula was flooded. Most homes along Beach Boulevard were destroyed, and FEMA trailers became an omnipresent sight. Due to the media focus on the plight of New Orleans and Biloxi-Gulfport in the aftermath of Katrina, many Pascagoula citizens have expressed feeling neglected or even forgotten following the storm. Most Pascagoula residents did not possess flood insurance, and many were required to put their homes on pilings before being given a permit to rebuild. Additionally, TITANTubes (sometimes referred to as geotubes) were installed under the beach to serve as low-profile dune cores to protect the evacuation route. United States Navy officials announced that two guided missile destroyers that were under construction at Northrop Grumman Ship Systems in Pascagoula had been damaged by the storm, as well as the amphibious assault ship . Hurricane Katrina damaged over forty Mississippi libraries, flooding the Pascagoula Public Library's first floor and causing mold in the building. Point of interest Pascagoula Art Depot, a gallery for local artists The United States post office in Pascagoula contains a mural, Legend of the Singing River, painted in 1939 by Lorin Thompson. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The mural was restored in the 1960s as the building became the Pascagoula Public Library. The building was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the mural was placed in storage. In 2010, it was re-installed at the new Pascagoula post office on Jackson Avenue. Pascagoula is the home of the Old Spanish Fort, the oldest building in the Mississippi Valley. It was built sometime in the 1750s. Geography Pascagoula is located along Mississippi Sound, on the east side of the mouth of the Pascagoula River. It is bordered to the north by Moss Point and to the west, across the Pascagoula River, by Gautier.

Prior to World War II, the town was a sleepy fishing village of about 5,000. The population skyrocketed with the war-driven shipbuilding industry. Although the city's population seemed to peak in the late 1970s and early 1980s as Cold War defense spending was at its height, Pascagoula experienced some new growth and development in the years before Hurricane Katrina. Today, Pascagoula is home to the state's largest private, single-site employer, Ingalls Shipbuilding, owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries. Other major industries include the largest Chevron refinery in the world; Rolls Royce Naval Marine specializing in U.S. Navy ship propulsion; and First Chemical/Chemours.

The population was 2,108 at the 2010 census.United States Census Bureau, American FactFinder, 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011. An agricultural and resort area, Holderness is home to the Squam Lakes Natural Science Center and is located on Squam Lake. Holderness is also home to Holderness School, a co- educational college-preparatory boarding school. History The Squam Lakes were a trade route for Abenaki Indians and early European settlers, who traveled the Squam River to the Pemigewasset River, then to the Merrimack River and seacoast. In 1751, Thomas Shepard submitted a petition on behalf of 64 grantees to Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth for 6 miles square on the Pemigewasset River. The governing council accepted, and the town was named after Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness. The French and Indian War, however, prevented settlement until after the 1759 Fall of Quebec. The land was regranted as New Holderness in 1761 to a group of New England families, and first settled in 1763. As proprietor of half the town, Samuel Livermore intended to create at New Holderness a great estate patterned after those of the English countryside. By 1790, the town had 329 residents, and in 1816, \\"New\\" was dropped from its name. Holderness became a farming and fishing community, except for the \\"business or flat iron area\\" located on the Squam River, which has falls that drop about 112 feet before meeting the Pemigewasset River. With water power to operate mills, the southwestern corner of town developed into an industrial center, to which the Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad entered in 1849. But the mill village would be at odds with the agricultural community, especially when denied civic amenities including gaslights and sidewalks. Consequently, in 1868, it was set off as Ashland. Tourists in the 19th century discovered the region's scenic mountains and lakes. Before the age of automobiles, they would depart the train in Ashland and board a steamer, which traveled up the Squam River to rustic fishing camps or hillside hotels beside Squam Lake. Today, Holderness remains a popular resort area, where in 1981 the movie On Golden Pond was filmed.

It is part of the Hattiesburg metropolitan area. It had a decline in population from 6,305 at the 2000 census to 5,909 at the 2010 census. Geography West Hattiesburg is in northeastern Lamar County and is bordered to the north, east, and south by the city of Hattiesburg. The area of West Hattiesburg dropped from at the 2000 census to as of 2019, primarily due to annexation of land by the city of Hattiesburg. Of the CDP's area in 2019, , or 0.31%, are water. Lairds Lake is the main water body in the community. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 6,305 people, 4,464 households, and 2,601 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 892.0 people per square mile (377.3/km). There were 2,633 housing units at an average density of 372.5/sq mi (143.8/km).

Incorporation A movement for incorporation has been attempted repeatedly over the years, but the courts have never ruled on the substance of it. The issues involve getting articles of incorporation which all would agree to, as well as who wants incorporation (who will profit, who will end up paying more in taxes). Proponents say incorporation will benefit all residents, but the opposition says it will only benefit the persons who hold that property which is yet to be fully developed within the real estate market over the next few years. Another argument against incorporation is that the proposal and its budget outline didn't fully account for the additional expenditures and costs of running the new city. Proponents counter that the overall cost will be lower, because of a more distributed risk amongst homeowners, who would essentially bear about 80% of the additional taxes to support this city. http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com has extensive archives about this issue, including opinion columns authored by the actual people engaged in the debate both pro and con. It is a good case study in local politics. Origins of \\"West Hattiesburg\\" West Hattiesburg was a rarely used term by residents, and was first popularized by out of towners who saw the area listed on Google Maps with that name, with the original source of the name from the U.S. Census Bureau. Residents of the area are gradually picking up the term. West Hattiesburg should not be confused with Oak Grove which is directly to the west close but considered its own area. This can be complicated because (as of 2016) West Hattiesburg public school students are still educated in the Oak Grove school system. Roads Two major highways pass near West Hattiesburg. Interstate 59 forms the eastern border of the community, and U.S. Highway 98 passes just north of the current CDP, through land annexed by the city of Hattiesburg. Due to recent population growth and migration the area (and Lamar County) the traffic has gotten worse on Highway 98, which has led to Highway 98 being widened from 4 to 6 lanes and recently 4 to 8 lanes (only near Interstate 59) in the area. Three major roads parallel U.S. Highway 98 (4th Street, Oak Grove Road, and Lincoln Road) have also been victim to large inflows of traffic due to the large amount of motorists trying to avoid major traffic on 98. Education The Lamar County School District serves West Hattiesburg with neighboring Oak Grove's school system. There have been calls, however, for the district to build West Hattiesburg its own schools due to overpopulation. =High school= * Oak Grove High School (Grades 9-12) =Middle school= * Oak Grove Middle School (Grades 6-8) =Elementary schools= * Oak Grove Upper Elementary School (Grades 4-5) * Oak Grove Lower Elementary School (Grades 2-3) * Long Leaf Elementary School (Grades K-5) * Oak Grove Primary School (Grades K-1) References Category:Census- designated places in Lamar County, Mississippi Category:Census-designated places in Mississippi Category:Hattiesburg metropolitan area ","title":"West Hattiesburg, Mississippi"},{"id":"124685","text":"Landaff is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. At the 2010 census, the town population was 415.United States Census Bureau, American FactFinder, 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011.  History  The name on the town charter is Llandaff, after the Bishop of Llandaff, chaplain to England's King George III. Originally, however, the land was granted as Whitcherville to James Avery and 60 others on January 31, 1764. But those settlers forfeited their grant by failure to comply with the requirements of the charter, so the territory was re-granted to Dartmouth College on January 19, 1770. Settlements were made under the Dartmouth grant. Roads and a mill were built at the expense of the college, and on November 11, 1774, the town was incorporated. After the Revolutionary War, however, the first grantees successfully claimed that their forfeiture was illegal, so the college had to abandon its title and lose what it had expended in making the settlements. Landaff was originally much larger than today. It was changed by legislative actions over the years: * On July 2, 1845, it gained a small tract from the then-adjoining town of Lincoln. * On June 23, 1859, all of Landaff lying northwest of the Ammonoosuc River was annexed to the town of Lisbon. * On July 20, 1876, the town was divided, with the eastern half becoming the town of Easton. The Lisbon Area Historical Society promotes the public's interest in and appreciation for the Towns of Lisbon, Landaff and Lyman, and maintains the collection, preservation and cataloging of materials which establish or illustrate the history of the three Towns, their indigenous history and heritage, their exploration, settlement and development, as well as their cultural and artistic heritage.

The population was 13,151 at the 2010 census and an estimated 13,651 as of 2019. Lebanon is in western New Hampshire, south of Hanover, near the Connecticut River. It is the home to Dartmouth‚ÄìHitchcock Medical Center and Dartmouth Medical School, together comprising the largest medical facility between Boston, Massachusetts and Burlington, Vermont. Together with Hanover, New Hampshire, and White River Junction, Vermont, Lebanon is at the center of a Micropolitan Statistical Area, encompassing nearly 30 towns along the upper Connecticut River valley.  History  Lebanon was chartered as a town by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth on July 4, 1761, one of 16 along the Connecticut River. It was named for Lebanon, Connecticut, from where many early settlers had come or would come, including the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock, who arrived in 1770 and founded Dartmouth College. Lebanon, Connecticut was the original home of Moor's Indian Charity School, the antecedent of Dartmouth College. Early settlement concentrated along the Connecticut River in what is now West Lebanon, and along the Mascoma Lake region near Enfield. In the mid-19th century, a mill district developed at falls on the Mascoma River. Industries included, at various times, furniture mills, a tannery, several machine shops, a woolen textile mill and a clothing factory. In the mid-19th century, this district attracted many French workers from Canada's Quebec province. This became the center of town, although West Lebanon grew into a railroad hub with a separate identity after lines entered from Boston. This rail center would become known as Westboro after two trains collided when West Lebanon was mistaken for Lebanon. The mill district, like the railroad, declined into the 1950s and 1960s. The town suffered two major fires; the second, in 1964, destroyed a large portion of the old mill district. Reconstruction resulted in a controversial urban renewal project featuring a closed-off district, called The Mall, built to replace the destroyed Hanover Street area. Partly in defiance of economic decline, and partly to counter a movement by West Lebanon to declare itself an independent town, Lebanon re- incorporated as a city in 1958. The routing of Interstates 89 and 91 through Lebanon and nearby White River Junction, Vermont, in addition to the growth of Dartmouth College, led to the area's economic revival. The former mill town now has a mixed economy based on education, medical services, high-technology and retail. Just south of the village of West Lebanon, a major shopping district has sprung up at the intersection of Route 12A and I-89. Lebanon has undertaken improvements to its recreational facilities, including miles of hiking trails, a municipal ski area, a swimming pool and several sports fields. In 1991, the Dartmouth‚ÄìHitchcock Medical Center, along with most departments of Dartmouth Medical School, moved from Hanover to a new campus just south of the Lebanon-Hanover town line. A number of medical and high-tech firms have located facilities near the medical center campus. TomTom, a leading worldwide developer of mapping databases, has its North American headquarters in Lebanon. Novo Nordisk and Microsoft also have major facilities here.

It was a center of cotton planter culture in the 19th century. The population was 15,205 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the Greenwood Micropolitan Statistical Area. Greenwood developed at the confluence of the Tallahatchie and the Yalobusha rivers, which form the Yazoo River. Throughout the 1960s, Greenwood was the site of major protests and conflicts as African Americans worked to achieve racial integration, voter registration and access during the civil rights movement. History Howard Street, Greenwood Front Street buildings along the Yazoo River =Native Americans= The flood plain of the Mississippi River has long been an area rich in vegetation and wildlife, fed by the Mississippi and its numerous tributaries. Long before Europeans migrated to America, the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian nations settled in the Delta's bottomlands and throughout what is now central Mississippi. They were descended from indigenous peoples who had lived in the area for thousands of years. The Mississippian culture had built earthwork mounds in this area and throughout the Mississippi Valley, beginning about 950 CE. Their culture thrived for hundreds of years. In the nineteenth century, the Five Civilized Tribes in the Southeast suffered increasing encroachment on their territory by European-American settlers from the United States. Under pressure from the United States government, in 1830 the Choctaw principal chief Greenwood LeFlore and other Choctaw leaders signed the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, ceding most of their remaining land to the United States in exchange for land in Indian Territory, what is now southeastern Oklahoma. The government opened the land for sale and settlement by European Americans. LeFlore came to regret his decision on land cession, saying in 1843 that he was \\"sorry to say that the benefits realized from [the treaty] by my people were by no means equal to what I had a right to expect, nor to what they were justly entitled.\\" =European settlement= The first Euro-American settlement on the banks of the Yazoo River was a trading post founded in 1834 by Colonel Dr. John J. Dilliard and known as Dilliard's Landing. The settlement had competition from Greenwood Leflore's rival landing called Point Leflore, located three miles up the Yazoo River. The rivalry ended when Captain James Dilliard donated parcels in exchange for a commitment from the townsmen to maintain an all-weather turnpike to the hill section to the east, along with a stagecoach road to the more established settlements to the northwest.Smith, Frank E. (1954). The Yazoo River. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. pp. 57-58. The settlement was incorporated as \\"Greenwood\\" in 1844, named after Chief Greenwood LeFlore. The success of the city, founded during a strong international demand for cotton, was based on its strategic location in the heart of the Delta: on the easternmost point of the alluvial plain, and astride the Tallahatchie and Yazoo rivers. The city served as a shipping point for cotton to major markets in New Orleans, Vicksburg, Mississippi, Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri. Thousands of slaves were transported as laborers to Mississippi from the Upper South through the domestic slave trade, in a forced migration that moved more than one million slaves in total to the Deep South to satisfy the demand for labor. Cotton cultivation was developed in these new territories of the Deep South. Greenwood continued to prosper, based on slave labor on the cotton plantations and in shipping, until the latter part of the American Civil War. =Later 19th century= With the abolition of slavery after the end of the Civil War in 1865, the labor market was changed to one of free labor. Away from the riverfronts, the state was 90 per cent undeveloped frontier. Many freedmen withdrew from working for others. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, many blacks managed to clear and buy their own farms in the bottomlands behind the rivers.John C. Willis, Forgotten Time: The Yazoo- Mississippi Delta after the Civil War. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2000 With the disruption caused by war and with changes to labor, cotton production initially declined, harming Greenwood's previously thriving economy. The construction of railroads through the area in the 1880s revitalized the city; two rail lines ran to downtown Greenwood close to the Yazoo River, and shortened transportation to markets. Greenwood again emerged as a prime shipping point for cotton. Downtown's Front Street, bordering the Yazoo, was dominated by cotton factors and related businesses, earning that section the name 'Cotton Row'. =20th century= The city continued to prosper well into the 1940s. Cotton production suffered in Mississippi during the infestation of the boll weevil in the early 20th century; however, for many years the bridge over the Yazoo displayed the sign \\"World's Largest Inland Long Staple Cotton Market\\". Cotton cultivation and processing became largely mechanized in the first half of the 20th century, displacing thousands of sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Since the late 20th century, some Mississippi farmers have begun to replace cotton with corn and soybeans as commodity crops; with the textile manufacturing industry having shifted overseas, farmers can gain stronger prices for the newer crops, used mostly as animal feed.Krauss, Clifford. \\"Mississippi Farmers Trade Cotton Plantings for Corn\\", The New York Times, May 5, 2009 Greenwood's Grand Boulevard was once named one of America's 10 most beautiful streets by the U.S. Chambers of Commerce and the Garden Clubs of America. Sally Humphreys Gwin, a charter member of the Greenwood Garden Club, planted the 1,000 oak trees that line Grand Boulevard. In 1950, Gwin received a citation from the National Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution in recognition of her work in the conservation of trees.Kirkpatrick, Mario Carter. Mississippi Off the Beaten Path, GPP Travel, 2007. Civil rights era In 1955, following the US Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that segregated public education was unconstitutional, Robert B. Patterson in Greenwood founded the White Citizens' Council to fight against racial integration. Chapters were established across the state. From 1962 to 1965, Greenwood was a center of protests and voter registration struggles during the Civil Rights Movement. The SNCC, COFO, and the MFDP were all active in the city. During this period, hundreds of African Americans were arrested in nonviolent protests; civil rights activists were subjected to repeated violence by police and whites. In addition, whites used economic retaliation against African Americans who attempted to register to vote: they fired them from jobs, evicted them from rental housing, and cut off federal commodity subsidies in poor communities.Mississippi Voter Registration ‚Äî Greenwood, crmvet.org; accessed June 29, 2018. The city police set their police dogs on protesters, with white counter-protesters yelling \\"\\" from the sidewalk. The Catholic peace organization Pax Christi, which had a chapter in the city, organized an economic boycott of businesses that discriminated against blacks, thereby supporting the civil rights movement. Pax Christi's ultimately successful efforts were encouraged by native Mississippian Joseph Bernard Brunini, the Bishop of Jackson. Major gains were achieved by the movement with Congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. However, much remained to be accomplished in terms of enacting these laws. White resistance to change continued. In June 1966, James Meredith, the first African American to attend the University of Mississippi, announced that to protest racism, he was going to walk from Memphis to Jackson, a distance of more than 200 miles, in a March Against Fear. He invited only men to walk with him, in a journey he wanted to be independent of the movement organizations. After Meredith was shot and hospitalized for injuries two days into his walk, a number of high-profile civil rights leaders of major organizations, including Stokely Carmichael of SNCC, Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Floyd McKissick and Roger Wilkins of the NAACP, vowed to continue the march. They encouraged others to join them. Their goals differed, and organizing the logistics of food and shelter for larger groups were more difficult. The state committed to protect the marchers if they obeyed the law. Some groups expanded their goals in the march to achieve community organizing and voter registration in the Delta communities they encountered. National leaders tended to come and go, checking in on the march in the midst of other responsibilities; some marchers also walked for short periods, while others stayed through most of the journey. With high- spirited gatherings and song, they recruited marchers from local residents, for at least part of the journey. Many local whites jeered and threatened the marchers, driving near them and waving Confederate flags. When the group reached Greenwood on June 17, Carmichael was arrested but released after a few hours. Later, in Greenwood's Broad Street Park, Carmichael gave his Black Power speech, which became well known, stating: The speech marked a turning point in the civil rights movement; many younger members took up Carmichael's slogan, and used it to support the use of violence to defend their freedom. This seemed to catalyze the fragmentation of the civil rights movement in the mid 1960s, but the process was already under way. On this occasion, the marchers persisted, growing in number as they neared the capital, and totaled more than 15,000 when they entered Jackson. =21st century= In 2006, the first female and first African-American mayor, Sheriel F. Perkins, was elected. Geography Greenwood is located at (33.518719, -90.183883). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The population was 12,520 at the 2010 U.S. Census. It is the county seat of Lincoln County. It was named after the town of Brookhaven, New York, by founder Samuel Jayne in 1818. History South Railroad Avenue, 1952 Brookhaven is located in what was formerly territory of the Choctaw. The city was founded in 1818 by Samuel Jayne from New York, who named it after the town of Brookhaven on Long Island.Brookhaven, Mississippi. Most of the Choctaw were forced out of Mississippi in the 1830s under Indian Removal, and were given lesser land in Indian Territory. The railroad was constructed though Brookhaven in 1858. It connected Brookhaven with New Orleans to the south and Memphis to the north. During the Civil War, Brookhaven was briefly occupied at noon on April 29, 1863, by a raiding party of Union cavalry under the command of Colonel Benjamin Grierson. The Union force burned public buildings and destroyed the railroad. This was rebuilt after the war. In 1936 Brookhaven was chosen as the site of the Stahl-Urban garment plant.Stahl-Urban Photograph Collection In 1955, Lamar Smith, a black farmer and World War I veteran, was shot to death by whites mid-day on the lawn of the county courthouse in Brookhaven. He had been working to organize voter registration among blacks, who had been largely disenfranchised in the state since 1890 by barriers created by whites. After World War II, Smith was among the many veterans who became activists for civil rights, determined to regain their constitutional rights. No one was prosecuted for his murder. Geography Brookhaven is in central Lincoln County. Interstate 55 passes through the west side of the city, with access from Exits 38, 40, and 42. I-55 leads north to Jackson, the state capital, and south to Hammond, Louisiana. U.S. Route 51 runs parallel to I-55, passing through the west side of Brookhaven closer to the city center. US-51 leads north to Hazlehurst and south to McComb. U.S. Route 84 passes through the south side of Brookhaven, leading east to Prentiss and west to Natchez. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.41%, are water. The city expanded in late 2007 to almost triple its previous area, through a vote of annexation, to bring in suburban developments surrounding the older town and equalize taxing and services provided to the new metropolitan area.BrookhavenMS.org Brookhaven, MS (BRH) ‚Äî Great American Stations Demographics As of the 2010 census, there were 12,513 people, 4,768 households, and 3,146 families residing in the city of Brookhaven. The population density was 1,714.1 people per square mile (658.6/km2). There were 5,519 housing units at an average density of 756.0 per square mile (290.5/km2). The racial makeup of the city was fairly evenly split with 43.8% White, 54.1% African American, 0.1% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.2% from other races, and 1.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.9% of the population. There were 4,768 households, out of which 34.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.7% were married couples living together, 24.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.0% were non-families. 30.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48 and the average family size was 3.10. In the city, the population was spread out, with 26.4% under the age of 18, 5.5% from 20 to 24, 29.2% from 25 to 44, 25.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.1% who were 65 years of age or older.

Education The city is served by the Brookhaven School District of public schools. Up until 1970, separate systems were maintained for black students and white schools. When Brown v. Board required integration of schools in 1954, white citizens refused. In 1970, when the state finally capitulated and desegregated public schools, a private school, Brookhaven Academy, was created to allow white parents to keep their children from attending schools with black children. In 1988, Brookhaven High School hired a football coach, Hollis Rutter, from Brookhaven Academy. This so upset the black population, who felt that this was a racially-insensitive move, that a school boycott ensued, ultimately resulting in the rescission of Rutter's hiring. This school again came into the spotlight in 2018 when it became known that Cindy Hyde-Smith, a candidate for U.S. Senate known for making racially- incendiary statements, sent her daughter to this school. The statewide magnet high school, the Mississippi School of the Arts is also located in the city. Four Lincoln County public schools are also located in Brookhaven's rural areas: Bogue Chitto Attendance Center, Enterprise Attendance Center, Loyd Star Attendance Center and West Lincoln Attendance Center. The former institution of higher learning Whitworth Female College, founded in 1858, was located in Brookhaven. The all-girls college closed its doors in 1984. Media Brookhaven is a part of the Jackson, Mississippi television market, including news stations WLBT, WJTV, WAPT, and WDBD. The city is served by a daily newspaper called The Daily Leader.

It was briefly inhabited as a logging town in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The site of the former village is about west of North Conway, about from US Route 302 (the Crawford Notch Highway) via the U.S. Forest Service Sawyer River Road. The logging operation was established by Daniel Saunders Jr. and Charles W. Saunders, members of the Saunders family. The town was named for Samuel Livermore, a former United States senator who was the grandfather of Daniel Saunders' wife. The population was reported as 0 at the 2010 census.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.27%, is water. Nearly all of the town's area (99.7%) is part of the White Mountain National Forest.NH GRANIT Conservation Lands Data Layer, 2010. To the south is Waterville Valley, to the north and west is Lincoln (and a southern tip of Bethlehem), and to the east are Hart's Location, Bartlett and the northwestern corner of Albany. The village of Livermore was benchmarked with an elevation of , a quarter mile from the eastern boundary adjoining Hart's Location. Livermore is a long, relatively narrow township, forming a very rough approximation of a crescent with its endpoints at the north and west. Livermore and its neighbor to the west, Lincoln, occupy a large area of uninhabited woodland once known as the \\"Pemigewasset Wilderness\\" (a portion of which is preserved in the present-day WMNF Pemigewasset Wilderness in Lincoln). The original boundary between the two towns did not follow natural features, such as the crest of the divide that separates the Pemigewasset River and Saco River drainages, which led to numerous charges and countercharges of cutting over the line between the two owners, the Saunders family in Livermore and James Everell Henry in Lincoln. In addition, it was difficult to haul timber over the ridgecrest. Eventually a settlement was reached by which the New Hampshire legislature redrew the town boundary to run along the ridgecrest, with the Lincoln portion defined as that part of the territory that is drained by the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River and the Livermore portion as that drained by other rivers. This definition produced a peculiar result: there is a small piece of Livermore at the head of the Little River valley (part of the Ammonoosuc River drainage) that is not contiguous to the rest of the town - it is, in fact, from the nearest corner of the main part of the town. Since this fragment and all lands bordering it are now part of the White Mountain National Forest, this historical peculiarity no longer has any practical consequences. The curving northwestern border of the township follows the height of land between the drainage of the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River to the west and the headwaters of the Sawyer River and the Swift River to the east. Important summits along the border (from northeast to southwest) include Mount Bemis, at above sea level; Mount Lowell, at ; Mount Carrigain, the highest point in Livermore at ; Mount Kancamagus, at ; and Mount Osceola, at . Two roads cross the township of Livermore, although neither one is close to the site of Livermore village. The Kancamagus Highway (New Hampshire Route 112) crosses Kancamagus Pass () on the Lincoln/Livermore boundary and passes through several miles of the southeastern part of Livermore to a point just west of Sabbaday Falls. The Tripoli Road (not usually maintained for winter travel), which runs from the northern tip of Thornton through Thornton Gap to Waterville Valley, crosses the southwest corner of the township.  Demographics  As of the census of 2010, there were no people living in the township. Historical census figures are shown in the adjacent table. As a logging town where most of the actual logging was done in the winter by transient men hired for the season only, ascertaining the actual population of Livermore at any given time would have been problematic, and these census figures may have been influenced by how these transients were counted.  History  * 1874 - Grafton County Lumber Co. incorporated. * 1875 - Sawyer River Railroad incorporated. * 1876 - Livermore incorporated. * 1877 - Construction of Sawyer River Railroad begins to support logging activity. * 1896 - Topographic map shows railroad and twelve inhabited buildings. * 1927 - A November storm devastates the local lumber industry. * 1928 - The last mill is closed. * 1937 - All but one parcel of land is sold to the United States Forest Service for inclusion in the White Mountain National Forest. * 1949 - The last resident leaves town. * 1951 - Livermore dissolved by an act of the New Hampshire legislature. * 1970s - Bill defeated in State House for Lincoln to annex Livermore. Diatomaceous earth‚Äîalso called tripolite‚Äîwas once mined in Little East Pond and processed in a mill located in the southwestern part of Livermore township. The Tripoli Road received its name from this mill. The USFS Little East Pond Trail follows for some distance the grade of the old railroad that served the mill, and the ruins of the mill can still be found by following the line of the railroad grade into the woods for a short distance. However, this mill was far from the village of Livermore and was historically more identified with Thornton.

Phoenix Publishing: Canaan, NH. 1976 In the late 1770s, the town petitioned (ultimately unsuccessfully) to join Vermont. The scenic town common is surrounded with houses and public buildings dating from the late 1700s to the early 1900s. Stagecoaches traveling the old \\"Boston Turnpike\\" from Montreal in the 1830s passed through Lyme, stopping at the Lyme Inn (recently renovated), built in 1809. Next door to the inn is the 200-year- old Congregational Church. Its original 1815 steeple bell was cast by Paul Revere. It was later replaced with a bell cast by Henry N. Cooper & Co., Boston. A hand-wound clock mechanism from E. Howard & Co. strikes the hour. Behind the church is a row of horse sheds dating from 1810. The row of twenty- seven sheds standing today is the longest line of contiguous horse sheds in New England, and possibly in the United States.https://www.lymenh.gov/about- lyme/pages/heritage Originally each shed had the name of the owner on a sign above the door. The signs are still there, though not necessarily over the original shed. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water, comprising 1.62% of the town. Lyme is drained by Hewes, Grant, and Clay brooks, all flowing to the Connecticut River, which forms the western boundary of the town (and of the state of New Hampshire). The Lyme Common occupies the center of the village of Lyme, located about east of the Connecticut River. Lyme is a rural town. Most human development is in the western half of the town along the Connecticut River and New Hampshire Route 10, known as the Dartmouth College Highway. The eastern half of the town is mostly forest. The town is home to four great ponds: Post Pond, Pout Pond, Trout Pond, and Reservoir Pond. Holts Ledge is a cliff that faces east and is part of the Dartmouth Skiway. The edge of the cliff is fenced to protect falcons. The highest point in town is the summit of Smarts Mountain, at above sea level. A fire tower, which was built in 1915, is visible from miles away atop Smarts Mountain and sets it apart from other local mountains. The Appalachian Trail crosses the summits of Holts Ledge and Smarts Mountain. Demographics Lyme Common As of the census of 2010, there were 1,716 people, 705 households, and 503 families residing in the town. The population density was 31.4 people per square mile (12.1/km2).

The town is located along a bend of the Connecticut River, across from Barnet, Vermont. It was originally chartered as part of Lyman.  History  In 1762, Colonial Governor John Wentworth issued a grant (\\"Number 11\\") to 64 persons obligated to clear, farm and settle one tenth of each of their parcels or forfeit the grant. Only two made the attempt, but the charter was extended, in 1769, for another five years. Eleven of the original 64 grantees were named Lyman. In that same year, Wentworth also granted to one Colonel John Hurd of Portsmouth part of the land which is today within the bounds of Monroe. The grant was named Hurd's Location and included five small islands in the Connecticut River, known as \\"Deer Islands,\\" and a parcel of land from below the present Village Bridge to the foot of Fifteen Mile Falls. (reprint by Higginson Book Company, Salem, MA) In addition to Hurd's Location and the governor's , there were 23 lots of the 64 portions of Lyman located in \\"West Lyman,\\" or the \\"Lyman Plain,\\" now Monroe, making up less than of the present area. A portion of Bath, to the south, was annexed in 1897. The first known settlers on the \\"West Lyman\\" portion of Lyman were John Hyndman (also, \\"John Hinman\\"), with his wife and son, who settled on the largest of the Deer Islands (below the present-day Barnet Bridge) in 1784 and built a log cabin. When Colonel Hurd learned of Hyndman's structure, he sued to have him evicted. A Barnet benefactor settled the controversy by purchasing the title from Hurd. The first permanent settlers also came in the 1780s. They were the Olmstead families: Joseph, Timothy, and Israel, their wives and children. The first native son, Ethan Smith, was born in a cabin on the Canaan Road (over the Gardner Mountain to Lyman) in 1784. Because of the difficulty traversing the steep \\"Gardner's Mountain\\" , running north to south through the original Lyman grant of 1761, the settlers of the western portion had different priorities and needs than the rest of Lyman to the east. Monroe was incorporated as a separate town in 1854.Hamilton Child, Gazetteer of Grafton County NH, 1709-1886; Syracuse, NY (June 1886), \\"History of Lyman\\", p. 512 After appropriate consideration, it was named after President James Monroe. In 1860, Monroe had 619 residents. By 1880, the population decreased to 504.Hamilton Child, Gazetteer of Grafton County NH, 1709-1886, Syracuse, NY (June 1886), \\"History of Monroe\\", p. 551 \\"Captain\\"Title was an honorific bestowed by a grateful citizenry on many returning veterans of the Revolutionary War. Paddleford was actually a private Phillip Paddleford, a Revolutionary soldier, settled in 1790, and built Monroe's first sawmill and gristmill on what is now called Smith Brook. Peter Paddleford (1785-1859) was the inventor of the wooden Paddleford Truss for covered bridges. Many of his original bridges still stand. He was the builder of the \\"third Lyman Bridge\\" from Monroe to McIndoes, Vermont, in 1833, after the 1826 floods had taken out all bridges on the Connecticut River. It was a covered bridge of pine, over long, and stood for over 96 years, making it one of the oldest on the river.  Geology  Parts of the Ammonoosuc Gold Fields, which have never been successfully mined, are in Monroe. \\"Within the limits of the town are the narrows, at which place the Connecticut River is only five rods in width, being confined by walls of slate.\\" Several copper mines were excavated along the \\"Back Road\\" (now named Coppermine Road) and many parcels continue to have separate mining rights. Test borings and surface samples during the 1928-1930 construction of Frank D. Comerford Dam, in the Connecticut River, provided new geologic information regarding de-glaciation of the White Mountains, and became the namesake of the \\"Comerford Suite\\". The dam, located on what was once called \\"Fifteen Mile Falls\\", is now used for flood control, irrigation and generation of electrical power for transmission to New England states. At the time of its construction, it was the largest \\"retaining wall\\" in the United States, representing more than of concrete. Prior to the establishment of a series of dams, the river dropped in , from Dalton to Bath.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water, comprising 6.27% of the town. The town is bounded by the Connecticut River (which is also the state boundary with Vermont) to its west and the long ridge of Gardner Mountain to the east. Signal Mountain, a knob on Gardner Mountain, is the highest point in Monroe, measuring above sea level. It has long been a major surveying reference point for maps and plats of the area between Mount Mansfield and Mount Washington. NH 135 runs through the town, substantially parallel to the river, linking Monroe to Littleton to the north and Bath to the south. A northwestern segment of Bath was annexed to Monroe in 1895, stimulated by its shared geography with Monroe.

With a population of 1,353 in the 2010 census, the town is the second most populous city in Smith County, behind the county seat of Raleigh to the north. History Taylorsville was established on the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad in 1900. The site was selected by an employee of the railroad, and soon after a post office was built. The post office was originally located about five miles away in Old Taylorsville (now a community located off of Mississippi Highway 531), but was later moved to New Taylorsville. It was the moving of the post office to New Taylorsville that established the present location of the town. Soon after, the Old Stringer Hotel was built. Many years later, in 1946, it was burned down in an arson fire. The town of Taylorsville was founded as a result of the extensive pine forests that grow in Smith County and the surrounding areas. The vast majority of the area was cut by Eastman-Gardiner. As lumber was a very plentiful resource, new businesses and homes both were rapidly built. Today, the lumber industry remains a vital part of the town's economy, with Georgia Pacific having two lumber processing plants and one chemical plant (Plywood and Chemical Divisions in West Taylorsville, and the Paper Division in East Taylorsville) in the city. Today, the city is a bustling small town full of life. There are several major companies that have major branches (or are even headquartered) in Taylorsville, and the town has several stores and gas stations. It has several restaurants, including Catfish Cabin, 28 Diner and Los Charros. It also has a junior college vocational training facility run by Jones College, formerly known as Jones County Junior College. Taylorsville is the headquarters of Southern Pine Electric Power Association, an electric co-op chartered in March 1938 to serve 481 homes and farms. Today, Southern Pine Electric is one of the largest electric cooperatives in the United States with nearly 10,000 miles of energized line serving more than 65,000 meters. The 11-county service area encompasses 14.3% of the total land mass of Mississippi. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The city is located just west of the Leaf River, which passes under Mississippi Highway 28 about 1 mile outside of the Taylorsville city limits. The Leaf River is a main tributary of the Pascagoula River, which flows to the Gulf of Mexico.

History The Ridge c. 1912 First called Number Seven in a line of Connecticut River fort towns, Orford was incorporated in 1761 by Governor Benning Wentworth and named for Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford, who was England's first prime minister. It was settled in 1765 by Daniel Cross and wife from Lebanon, Connecticut.A. J. Coolidge & J. B. Mansfield, A History and Description of New England; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 By 1859, it had 1,406 inhabitants, most involved in agriculture. There was a large tannery, chair factory, 10 sawmills, a starch factory, a gristmill, a sash, blind and door factory, and 2 boot and shoe factories. An original grantee was General Israel Morey, whose son Samuel Morey discovered a way to separate hydrogen from oxygen in water, making possible the first marine steam engine. He recognized the potential of steam power after working at his father's ferry. In 1793, on the river at Orford, he was first to demonstrate the use of a paddlewheel to propel a steam boat. Author Washington Irving visited Orford in 1832 and is quoted as saying, \\"In all my travels in this country and in Europe, I have seen no village more beautiful than this. It is a charming place  nature has done her utmost here.\\"The White Mountains: A Handbook for Travellers; James R.

The population was 10,683 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Sunflower County. History In 1891, Minnie M. Cox was appointed postmaster of Indianola, becoming the first black female postmaster in the United States. Her rank was raised from fourth class to third class in 1900, and she was appointed to a full four-year term. Cox's position was one of the most respected and lucrative public posts in Indianola, as it served approximately 3,000 patrons and paid $1,100 annually, then a large sum. White resentment to Cox's prestigious position began to grow, and in 1902 some white residents in Indianola drew up a petition requesting Cox's resignation. James K. Vardaman, editor of The Greenwood Commonwealth and a white supremacist, began delivering speeches reproaching the people of Indianola for \\"tolerating a negro [sic] wench as a postmaster.\\" Racial tensions grew, and threats of physical harm led Cox to submit her resignation to take effect on January 1, 1903. The incident attracted national attention, and President Theodore Roosevelt refused to accept her resignation, feeling Cox had been wronged, and the authority of the federal government was being compromised. \\"Roosevelt stood resolute. Unless Cox's detractors could prove a reason for her dismissal other than the color of her skin, she would remain the Indianola postmistress.\\" Roosevelt closed Indianola's post office on January 2, 1903, and rerouted mail to Greenville; Cox continued to receive her salary. The same month, the United States Senate debated the Indianola postal event for four hours, and Cox left Indianola for her own safety and did not return. In February 1904, the post office was reopened but was demoted in rank from third class to fourth class. In July 1954, two months after the Supreme Court of the United States announced its unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education, ruling that school segregation was unconstitutional, the local plantation manager Robert B. Patterson met with a group of like-minded people in a private home in Indianola to form the White Citizens' Council.

The population was 1,677 at the 2010 census. History The current town square of Coldwater is approximately two miles south of the Coldwater River, hence the name. The original town began in 1856, called the village of Elm Grove. Construction of the Mississippi and Tennessee Railroad through here in 1858 stimulated development. Rows of stores and other businesses developed on both sides of the tracks, along with houses of worship. Coldwater was officially incorporated in 1872. At that time, the Town was located in DeSoto County and was a mile square, with the railroad depot at the center. The area was developed for cotton plantations and Coldwater became a trading center. In 1873 during Reconstruction, the legislature organized Tate County from portions of DeSoto, Marshall and Tunica counties. Coldwater fell into the new county. The Town began to grow with an influx of settlers from Virginia, the Carolinas, Alabama, and other areas seeking a better life for themselves and their families. There were 397 residents of Coldwater according to the 1890 census. By 1884, there were 96 small schools in Tate County: 54 white and 42 black. They were mostly one teacher, one-room log houses with split logs for seats. Coldwater steadily grew in numbers. However, periodic river flooding plagued the town, although it was also the basis of the farmland's fertility. The Army Corps of Engineers built the Arkabutla Lake and Dam project along the Coldwater River in the early 1940s. Town residents believed they needed to move and the Town was relocated and reconstructed on land about a mile and a half south of its original location. The site of the old town of Coldwater is MSL. Parts of it are underwater year round. Radio station WREC was founded in Coldwater by Hoyt B. Wooten. It broadcast news talk information. The station is now called WREG-TV and broadcasts news on a major news network.

The population was 1,096 at the 2010 census. The Woodville Republican, a weekly newspaper founded in 1823, is the oldest surviving business (and thus the oldest newspaper) in Mississippi. History This historic town, one of the oldest in Mississippi, is set among the rolling hills and pastures of Wilkinson County, just north of the Louisiana- Mississippi border in the southwest corner of the state. It was incorporated in 1811, after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and not long before Mississippi's admission to the United States in 1817. It was developed along the historic corridor between St. Francisville, Louisiana, 24 miles to the south and Natchez, Mississippi, 34 miles to the north. Since pre-colonial times, communities within this corridor have been linked, first by the Lower Natchez Trace, a footpath and portage developed by Native Americans and serving the east bank of the Mississippi River. In the 20th century, U.S. Highway 61, the \\"Blues Highway,\\" was later built along this route; it is considered the spine of jazz and blues music. Painter John James Audubon visited Woodville during his sojourn in St. Francisville in the 1820s. Here he found more than 26 of the species which he documented and painted for his Birds of America series. Numerous residents are descended from 18th-century settlers. Much of its significant architecture was built in the 19th century when cotton was the chief commodity crop and generating great profits for major planters. The community has organized the Woodville Main Street Association; the Wilkinson County ‚Äì Woodville Public Library; and the Wilkinson County Museum and the African-American Museum, both restored and owned by the Woodville Civic Club. Among the Main Street Association's initiatives are the Woodville Hospitality Station, providing tourist information and a rest stop to travelers on Highway 61, near the town boundary. The annual Deer and Wildlife Festival is staged each October on and around the Courthouse Square. The Civic Club has published three volumes of The Journal of Wilkinson County. A fourth book is in the works. A public school system (Wilkinson County School District) and a private alternative, the Wilkinson County Christian Academy (WCCA), offer co-educational grades K through 12. The town has a medical clinic and churches with active Catholic, Episcopal, Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian congregations. Woodville was developed based on two commodities: cotton and timber. The first was most important during the antebellum period. Planters developed numerous Wilkinson County cotton plantations, based on the intensive labor of enslaved Africans, with many relocated to the region from the Upper South. Merchants served the planters' families and freedmen after the Civil War. To get cotton to market, planters supported construction of the West Feliciana Railroad, the oldest standard-gauge system in the country, which once extended from Woodville to Bayou Sara, on the Mississippi River just south of St. Francisville. The West Feliciana Railroad had a terminus on Depot Street, where the railroad's office was located. The planter community thrived from the 1830s until the Civil War. It began to recover in the late 19th century, as the labor system settled into most freedmen working as sharecroppers or tenant farmers. Cotton continued to be important until 1920, by which time the boll weevil had decimated the cotton crop. In that second period of prosperity, the town was called \\"Little Jerusalem.\\" Sephardic Jewish businessmen came for economic opportunities and made significant contributions to the town's built environment and culture. Most of them later moved away. Woodville's synagogue burned in the 1930s, but its Jewish cemetery may be visited. Woodville remains notable for its role in a flourishing timber industry; the dedication and commitment of its residents, many of whom are third and fourth generation; its assemblage of 19th-century buildings in various classic styles; and its abundance of outdoor recreation, hunting and fishing in particular. Exploratory oil and gas drilling is taking place in the county. The town is home to the oldest continuously operating newspaper in Mississippi, the Woodville Republican, founded by W. A. Chisholm in 1821. It is published weekly by a great-grandson of John S. Lewis. who settled here in 1810. His family acquired the paper in 1878. The grocery store is Treppendahl's Super Foods, operated by a great-grandson of the first owner. The Treppendahls are now sixth-generation Woodvillians. Woodville's town plan is centered on a courthouse square planted with ancient oaks. The turn-of- the-20th century Beaux Arts-style courthouse has a spire. More than 100 buildings contribute to Woodville's National Register Historic District: they include structures from the first quarter of the 19th century, with examples of Federal, Eastlake, Arts and Crafts, Greek Revival, Beaux Arts, and Neo- classical architecture. Fronting Courthouse Square are the monumental office and banking house of the West Feliciana Railroad (c. 1834). The former railroad office now serves as the Wilkinson County Museum. The classic Federal-style former Branch Banking House of the State of Mississippi (c. 1819), the state's oldest existing bank building, has been adapted to serve as the African-American Museum. Notable domestic architecture includes the Neo- classical Lewis house (c. 1832) at 458 Church St., the monumental Feltus- Catchings house (c. 1820) at the southwest corner of First South and Depot, the Greek Revival Carnot Posey House (c. 1845) at 432 Church St., and the John William Goddard house at 940 Main Street.

The population was 563 at the 2010 census. The town overlooks the White Mountain National Forest, with views of the Presidential, Franconia, Kinsman and Dalton ranges. Sugar Hill was incorporated as a town in 1962, making it the most recent in New Hampshire to be split from another town.  History  Incorporated in 1962 out of the town of Lisbon after considerable litigation, Sugar Hill is the most recently incorporated town in the state. The name \\"Sugar Hill\\" comes from the large groves of sugar maples within the town limits. Offering clean air and panoramic views from atop Sunset Hill Ridge of both the White Mountains and Green Mountains, the community became a fashionable Victorian resort. First attracted by paintings of White Mountain artists, the wealthy arrived by train to escape the heat, humidity and pollution of summers in Boston, Hartford, New York and Philadelphia. Several hostelries were built, including the Hotel Lookoff. But the grandest was the Sunset Hill House, built in 1880 after rail service arrived in neighboring Lisbon Village (Sunset Hill Station). With the longest porch on a single side in New Hampshire, the Second Empire hotel accommodated 350 guests and 300 staff. Patrons found amusement in the casino, bowling alley, or on carriage rides touring nearby Franconia Notch. Built in 1897, the 9-hole Sugar Hill House Golf Course, together with its 1900 clubhouse, are the oldest in the state and today listed on the National Register. Bobby Jones played the links. With the advent of automobiles came a decline in grand hotels, however, as tourists were no longer restricted by the limits of rail service. The Sunset Hill House remained open until 1973, longer than many of its type in the region. But it closed at season's end, when the furnishings were sold at auction. The aging structure was demolished in 1974, although its annex survived and was purchased in 2013 by new owners, to reopen in 2015 as \\"The Inn at Sunset Hill\\". 247x247px = Peckett's-on-Sugar Hill = Robert P.

History  The French were the first Europeans to assert any territorial rights over the Poplar Bluff area. The French held the area until 1770 when it was ceded by treaty to Spain. Spain held the area until 1802 when it was returned to France. During this time the area of Poplar Bluff, as well as all of Butler County, held almost no European settlements until 1819, when the first white settler family moved into the Poplar Bluff area. It was reported that about 300 Native Americans resided in the area at that time. The earliest permanent settlements in what is now Butler County occurred in the early 19th century along the Natchitoches Trail, an old Native American Trail west of what is now Poplar Bluff on Ten Mile Creek and Cane Creek. Butler County was organized in 1849 and Poplar Bluff was chosen as the county seat. In 1855 the first courthouse was built and the town grew. In 1927 a tornado leveled most of the city, especially the original business district along Main and Broadway streets.

Parts of the White Mountain National Forest are in the east and west. The Appalachian Trail crosses the town's northwest corner. Russell Pond Campground is in the east. West of North Woodstock is the Lost River Reservation.  History  First granted in 1763, Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth named the town Peeling after an English town. Many of the first colonists were originally from Lebanon, Connecticut. In 1771, his nephew, Governor John Wentworth, gave it the name Fairfield, after Fairfield, Connecticut. The town was renamed Woodstock in 1840 for Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, England, possibly due to the popularity of the 1826 Walter Scott novel Woodstock. Logging became a principal early industry, with sawmills established using water power from the Pemigewasset River. The entrance of the railroad in the 19th century opened the wilderness to development, carrying away wood products to market. It also brought tourists, many attracted by paintings of the White Mountains by White Mountain artists. Several inns and hotels were built to accommodate the wealthy, who sought relief from the summer heat, humidity and pollution of coal-age Boston, Hartford, New York and Philadelphia. They often relaxed by taking carriage rides through the White Mountains, or by hiking along the Lost River in Lost River Reservation. But with the advent of automobiles, patrons were no longer restricted by the limits of rail service. Consequently, many grand hotels established near depots declined and closed. Woodstock, however, remains a popular tourist destination. The Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, an outdoor laboratory for ecological studies founded by the United States Forest Service in 1955, is located in the southern part of town.

History Most of the pioneers in the early settlements were from the state of Virginia. One among them was Abner Holt who with his family traveled to Howard County, Missouri, in 1819. They settled there for the winter. The men built a house in Callaway County in the unnamed community now known as Holts Summit, and the family settled in during the spring. In 1870, Holt's grandson, Timothy Holt, plotted Holts Summit around a general store built by his father James Holt. They named the village ‚ÄúHolts Summit‚Äù because it was the highest point from there to the Missouri River. ‚ÄúHibernia Station‚Äù was once located across from where North School is now located. The train carried travelers between Hibernia and Holts Summit. Because of declining traffic as autos became more popular, the train depot was torn down in 1934. Holts Summit was incorporated in 1973. In the 1960s and 1970s, winemakers began to rebuild the Missouri wine industry. Summit Lake Winery was founded in 2002 in Holts Summit, linking the town to what is called the Missouri Rhineland, the area defined by vineyards along the Missouri River from Callaway County to the western part of St. Charles County.

The population was 1,126 at the 2010 census. Although North Haverhill is now the county seat of Grafton County, the village of Woodsville has traditionally been considered the county seat, as the county courthouse was originally located there. The county buildings are now located halfway between Woodsville and the village of North Haverhill to the south. History Woodsville on US302 Woodsville was named for John L. Woods, a figure in its early development. He arrived from Wells River, Vermont, a village across the Connecticut River narrows in Newbury, and in 1829 purchased a sawmill which had been operating on the Ammonoosuc River since 1811. He manufactured pine lumber, and opened a store in his house.Hamilton Child, Gazetteer of Grafton County, N.H.; Syracuse, New York 1886 Spring snowmelt carried log drives down the Connecticut and Ammonoosuc rivers. A log boom was built across the Connecticut River to Wells River to hold the logs briefly for sorting. Logs not destined for Woods' mill were released gradually to avoid jams in the Ox Bow meadow downstream. Log drivers detailed to work at the boom enjoyed Woodsville's saloons and red- light district. The Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad opened at Woodsville in 1853 and built its division offices and a branch repair shop. It replaced the original 1805 bridge between the states with a two-level span, featuring a toll highway below and railroad tracks on the roof. The village boomed into an important railway town and junction, endowed with fine examples of Victorian architecture. It also became a center for legal affairs. The log drives were stopped after 1915, when pleasure boat owners complained about the hazards to navigation. In 1889, the Grafton County Court moved from Haverhill Corner to Woodsville, where it remained until moving halfway to North Haverhill in 1972.Katherine Blaisdell, \\"The Grafton County Seat;\\" Outlook Magazine 1983 Image:Maple Street, Woodsville, NH.jpgMaple Street in 1906 Image:Railroad Bridge, Woodsville, NH.jpgRailroad bridge c. 1906 Image:Opera Block, Woodsville, NH.jpgOpera Block c. 1915 Geography Woodsville is in the northwest corner of the town of Haverhill, bordered to the north by the town of Bath and to the west by the Connecticut River, which forms the state border with Vermont.

The population was 85 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Cape Girardeau- Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. Name The first settlement was made at Old Appleton in 1824. The community of Old Appleton was originally known as Apple Creek, named after the stream Apple Creek on which the village is located. By the 1870s the village had become known as Appleton. In 1918, the word \\"Old\\" was incorporated into the name to eliminate confusion with Appleton City in St. Clair County, Missouri.The State Historical Society of Missouri: Cape Girardeau Place Names http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_cape_girardeau.html History Although it is not known who the original native inhabitants were of the Old Appleton area, the area eventually become home to the Shawnee and Delaware Indians. Having originated in present-day Delaware and Pennsylvania, the Shawnee and Delaware Indians had been pushed off their lands by white settlement. In the 1780s, Pierre Louis Lorimier, a French Canadian who had worked as an Indian-interpreter for the British, found it in his best interest to leave the American states. He settled Cape Girardeau in the Ste. Genevieve District with his wife, who was of mixed French and Shawnee ancestry. Lorimier was subsequently made the Indian Agent by the Spanish colonial authorities. Like Lorimier, the Shawnee and Delaware Indians had sided with the British, and found themselves in an unsavory situation. Lorimier appealed for land grants from the Spanish authorities for the settlement of Shawnee and Delaware Indians from American territory.Ozark Historical Resource Study, CHAPTER 2: Early Native American and European Contact http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/ozar/hrs2.htm The Spanish granted Lorimier two large tracts of land in the Apple creek watershed, with the intention of the Shawnee and Delaware acting as a buffer against the Osage Indians, who were not on friendly terms with the Spanish authorities. Lorimer then convinced 1,200 Shawnee and 600 Delaware to relocate to the Apple Creek watershed, and in 1784 the group of Shawnee and Delaware migrated and settled down in the area of Old Appleton. The \\"Le Grand Village Sauvage\\" was to the west of present-day Old Appleton and the \\"Petit Village Sauvage\\" was to the east of Old Appleton. The Shawnee and Delaware villages had a significant amount of racial mixing with the French, and were said to have as much French ancestry as the French had Indian ancestry. Culturally, the Shawnee and Delaware had largely adopted French and American ways and lifestyles, and had built granaries and barns for the storing of their crops and housing of their cattle and horses. The Shawnee and Delaware built their log homes in the French fashion with posts set together and interstices filled with clay, with wood shingled roofs. Jefferson National Expansion Memorial: Shawnee and Delaware http://www.nps.gov/jeff/historyculture/shawnee-and-delaware.htm In the early 1800s American settlers began encroaching on the Shawnee and Delaware lands around Apple Creek. In 1807 the Shawnee requested protection from the Osage. Although the Americans had agreed to honor Spanish treaties and articles made with local tribes, the treaties were eventually ignored. In 1809, harassment and stealing by American settlers eventually drove the Shawnee and Delaware to visit the territorial governor Meriwether Lewis and pressed their \\"long-expressed wish\\" to exchange of their lands in the Apple Creek watershed with lands farther west. The Shawnee and Delaware stayed, but by 1815 the situation had worsened so much that territorial governor William Clark and US president Madison ordered all white intruders removed from Shawnee and Delaware lands. However, this order was largely ignored by the authorities. By 1816, the encroachment by white settlers left the US Federal Government no choice but to relocate the Shawnee and Delaware to lands further west. In 1824, John McClain and John Schatz established a settlement on Apple Creek known as \\"Apple Creek\\". By the time the post office was established in 1876 the town had become known as Appleton. Old Appleton was also home to several breweries, among them \\"The Old Appleton Brewery\\", until prohibition forced their closures. In 1982, a flood on Apple creek destroyed McClain Mill and Old Appleton's original bridge. The historic bridge was restored in 2006. The Old Appleton Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

History Post Office Square in 1910 Like many New England towns, Amherst was the result of a land grant given to soldiers ‚Äì in this case, to soldiers in 1728 who had participated in King Philip's War. Settled about 1733, it was first called \\"Narragansett Number 3\\", and then later \\"Souhegan Number 3\\". In 1741, settlers formed the Congregational church and hired the first minister. Chartered on 18 January 1760Hayward's New England Gazetteer (1839) by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, the town was named for General Lord Amherst,Statistics and Gazetteer of New-Hampshire (1875) who commanded British forces in North America during the French and Indian War. Lord Amherst is also known for initiating the practice of giving smallpox blankets to Native Americans in an effort \\"to Extirpate this Execrable Race\\" (as quoted from his letter to Colonel Henry Bouquet on July 16, 1763). In 1770, Amherst became the county seat of Hillsborough County, due largely to its location on the county's major east-west road. It continued to prosper through the Revolutionary War and afterwards. In 1790, the southwestern section broke off and became the town of Milford, and in 1803, the northwest section departed to become Mont Vernon. The development of water-powered mills allowed Milford to grow at Amherst's expense, and the county seat was moved to Milford in 1866. The town population remained relatively stagnant until after World War II, when Amherst and many surrounding towns saw an influx of newcomers as they became part of the greater Boston region. Franklin Pierce, who later become the 14th President of United States of America, studied under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst. He wed Jane Means Appleton, the daughter of a former president of Bowdoin College, in a house on the town green. The Nashua and Wilton Railroad passed through Amherst.
