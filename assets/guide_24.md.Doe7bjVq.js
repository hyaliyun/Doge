The internationally co-produced film is notable for its innovative use of fiction and documentary. Manchevski attributes his experiment to his interest in the blurring lines between truth and fiction, drama and documentary. The three stories focus on three aspects of life in contemporary Republic of Macedonia (a city, a small town and a deserted village). Mothers, whose motto is “The Truth Hurts” explores the nature of truth – all three stories (two fiction and one documentary) are based on real events, but only one - the most incredible - is told as documentary. This story examines the unsolved mystery of the Kichevo serial killer who murdered several retired cleaning women. A crime reporter who covered the stories was arrested, and two days later he was found dead with his head in a bucket of water. A suicide note was found in his cell. Mothers premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and had its European premiere in the Panorama section of the 61st Berlin International Film Festival. Premise Three stories, all true, one real. Employing an innovative structure, the three stories in Mothers highlight the delicate relationship of truth and fiction, of drama and documentary. What is the nature of truth? The film eschews neat narrative devices and pushes to confront their own definitions of filmic reality.

He is Emeritus Professor of Development Studies and former Director of the International Migration Institute, University of Oxford. Career Robin Cohen was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. He left in 1964, returning to the country for three years in the post-Mandela period, when he served as Dean of Humanities at the University of Cape Town (2001–04). He has held appointments at the universities of Ibadan, Nigeria (1967–69), Birmingham, UK (1969–77), the West Indies (Professor of Sociology, 1977-9), Warwick, UK (Professor of Sociology, 1979–2006) and Oxford (2006–). He is former director of the International Migration Institute which forms part of the Oxford Martin School. Cohen was principal investigator on the Oxford Diasporas Programme, funded by the Leverhulme Trust. Intellectual contribution Robin Cohen's doctoral work was published as Labour and politics in Nigeria (1974). There followed collaborative work on labour movements and labour history in other parts of Africa. However, his interest and expertise in labour developed into a wider project about the continuing significance of the movement of people across national boundaries and the problems to which this has given rise in very many parts of the world. In The new Helots (1987), he suggested that Marx had underestimated the continuing salience of migrant labour, a feature that allowed capitalism to thrive and thereby evade the fundamental confrontation between worker and employer that Marx predicted. Cohen made a number of other contributions to the field of migration studies by giving new understandings to key contested concepts such as diaspora and borders, citizens and denizens, and collective or national identity. In Frontiers of identity, (1994) he argued that 'fuzzy' frontiers within the UK and between Britain, the Commonwealth, and the wider world create a particular ambiguous notion of 'Britishness'. His most influential work, Global diasporas, (1997, with subsequent editions and translations) continued his analysis of the relationship between identity and migration. Through the use of typologies, comparisons and suggestive lists of shared characteristics, Cohen was able to employ the ancient concept of diaspora to enrich the study of present-day transnational migrant flows.“Global Diasporas: An Introduction” by Robin Cohen. Andrew Blackman (16 April 2010). Retrieved on 13 November 2010.

She made significant contributions to the field of music librarians, and authored several books and articles regarding musical information and resources in New Zealand.  Early life and family Freed was born in Dunedin, New Zealand. Her father was James Gerald Stokely Doorly, a mariner and Antarctic explorer, musician, and author, and her mother was Forrestina Muriel Whitson. She was the younger of two daughters. Early in her childhood, her family moved from New Zealand to Williamstown, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. She completed her public education in Melbourne, before returning to New Zealand in 1936, when she was 17. In New Zealand, she found work in a secretarial and media role. She married her husband William Ian Freed in 1940, and together they had three children.  Education  While Freed was raising her three children, she enrolled at Victoria University College to study composition. She studied under Douglas Lilburn, and graduated with a Bachelor of Music in composition in 1958, at the age of 39. In 1959, she qualified and began her career as a librarian in Wellington. She also underwent additional compositional training from 1964 to 1966, when she travelled to London and studied with composers Peter Racine Fricker and Elisabeth Rutyens.  Career  From the start of her tenure as a librarian in 1959 to her retirement in 1986, Freed worked tirelessly as a music librarian, as well as an advocate for other New Zealand composers. As part of her work, she helped to found SOUNZ, the Centre For New Zealand Music, which is an online library that contains a large selection of scores, CDs, books, and resources. This library also contains biographical information about composers, helping to create a comprehensive database for the preservation of New Zealand music. In addition, she founded the New Zealand division of the International Association of Music Librarians in 1982, and then served as its president. The association holds annual board conferences, launches collaborative projects between library branches, and publishes journals, which all help to strengthen the library community in New Zealand.  Awards and recognition  In 1958, Freed won the New Zealand Broadcasting Service/Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Award for a New Zealand song. She also won the Phillip Neill Memorial Prize in composition, an award seeking to acknowledge the compositional accomplishments of students in New Zealand. In 1980, she was again recognized by APRA for outstanding services to music. She was awarded a Lilburn Trust Grant for services to music librarianship and music in New Zealand in 1991. In the 1998 Queen's Birthday Honours, Freed was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to music.  Legacy  Freed left behind two personal memoirs, written towards the end of her life. “A Grandmother’s Story” was written for her granddaughters, and follows her personal account of her early life, her marriage, her time at the University of Wellington, and her career as a musician and librarian. The other memoir, “I Seem To Have Forgotten The Elephants”, contains 32 shorter memoirs from various parts of her life. She never sought to publish her memoirs, but they are available on her personal website, which is maintained by Freed’s grandniece.

The character originated in a short story written by the film's director, Sam Raimi, titled \\"The Darkman,\\" and is based on the Universal Pictures' movie monsters while retaining traits of the DC Comics World War II disfigured hero the Unknown Soldier. He was portrayed by Liam Neeson in the original film and Arnold Vosloo in the sequels.  Fictional character biography  In the third film and the un-aired television pilot, his biography is slightly retconned, but the character's canonical history is as such: Peyton Westlake was a mild-mannered and brilliant scientist working on a synthetic \\"skin\\" capable of aiding burn victims. He had a good relationship with district attorney Julie Hastings, who indirectly caused his injuries by telling corrupt developer Louis Strack, Jr. that he could not build his \\"city of the future\\" without a permission document from Westlake's laboratory. At this, Strack hired sadistic mobster Robert G. Durant to get the document and in the process, Durant and his gang brutally disfigured Westlake, killed his assistant and destroyed his lab. Julie believed he was dead and a funeral was held, but Westlake's hideous body was placed in a clinic that was used for various experiments to sever Westlake's pain receptors, which enhances his strength but leaves him unable to feel tactile sensations. The experiments, however, affected Westlake's mental stability and he became an impulsive, bipolar, sarcastic, and violent man. Westlake escaped the clinic and sought refuge in an abandoned building in the film's city. He hid his grotesque appearance with bandages and a trenchcoat and used his synthetic skin, which only lasts 99 minutes in the light. He managed to rebuild a relationship with Julie, claiming he survived his \\"accident\\" and was constantly fleeing so that she does not see his true face. As \\"Darkman\\", he begins ruining Durant's illegal activities by framing his gang so Durant kills his own men, including his possible implied lover. After discovering the culprit is Darkman, Durant attempts to kill him from a helicopter using a grenade launcher. Darkman manages to defeat his archenemy by clinging to the helicopter and using his strength to pull it into a tunnel and explode the chopper. Darkman gratifyingly yells, \\"Burn in Hell!\\" After this, Darkman poses as Durant in order to infiltrate Strack's new skyscraper, which was the reason the developer hired Durant in the first place. Strack suspects Darkman will come after him and takes Julie hostage. Strack suggests they join forces but when he refuses they battle atop the skyscraper. Darkman has the chance to spare his life but instead throws Strack to his death. Believing he has become too much of a monster to be with Julie, that he abandons her, vowing to become a vigilante and bringer of justice. After a year of crimefighting, Darkman is shocked to discover that Durant is alive and back in town and that he must again battle his archenemy. He also wishes to avenge a scientist named Brinkman, who he had been partnering with in order to perfect his synthetic skin so he may lead a normal life. After defeating Durant, Darkman found a new enemy in drug lord Peter Rooker who proved to be his most powerful adversary after going through a process that makes his strength equal to Darkman's. Darkman managed to bring down Rooker by posing as him but felt conflicted as he fell in love with Rooker's wife and young daughter, who he had to abandon as well to resume his life as a vigilante. Beforehand, however, he finally manages to perfect his synthetic skin but uses the only sample to heal Rooker's daughter.  Powers and abilities  Due to clinical experiments, the nerve endings connected to Darkman's skin have been severed, rendering him immune to pain, but unable to feel physical sensations. Additionally, to compensate for his loss of physical feelings, adrenaline flows unchecked through Darkman's body, enhancing his physical strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, and durability. Using his synthetic skin, Darkman is able to pose as criminals, imitate their voices, and trick them into engineering their own downfall. He's also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and an expert in the fields of science with a genius-level intellect.  Personality  Darkman possesses similar ethics to those of a superhero, such as not harming the innocent, but has the tenacity and impulsiveness of a sociopath, as demonstrated when he revels in the suffering of criminals. He also has a dangerous temper, as seen in Darkman when he (disguised as his former self) breaks the fingers of an obnoxious carnival worker for refusing to give Julie Hastings the prized elephant. When Julie refuses the prize, he remarks, furiously, \\"Take the fucking elephant!\\" When a cat hisses at him, he is enraged and argues with the cat, and accuses it of thinking he is a \\"freak of nature.\\" Despite his temper and preference for violence, Darkman also has a morbid sense of humor in sticky situations. For example, Darkman breaks into a business meeting while attached to Durant's chopper. He remarks to the businessman, \\"Excuse me!\\" before being pulled off again, and when Strack begs for mercy, stating murder will haunt his conscience. Darkman, after only some hesitation, drops him to his death and remarks, \\"I'm learning to live with a lot of things.\\"  Appearances  =Films=  Darkman  This film documents Darkman's origins and his relationship with Julie, and systematically showing his transformation into a vengeful criminal killer and his first battle with Durant and the businessman Strack.  Darkman II: The Return of Durant  Durant survives his ordeal from the first film and plans to take over the city using futuristic weaponry. Only Darkman can stop his archenemy and avenge one of Durant's latest victims.  Darkman III: Die Darkman Die  Drug lord Peter Rooker allies with a scientist who also worked on Darkman's superhuman strength and invulnerability. He invents a steroid that gives test subjects superhuman strength, but leaves them mentally unstable. Darkman then poses as Rooker to foil his plan, but ends up having to save the villain's family. =Novels= At the time of the first film’s release Jove Books published a novelisation written by Randall Boyll. In 1994 Boyll wrote four new novels (The Hangman, The Price of Fear, The Gods of Hell, and In the Face of Death) which continue Darkman’s story and expands his character and background. =Comics= At the time of the film’s release in 1990 Marvel Comics published a three issue comic book adaption. In 1993 Marvel also published a six issue miniseries about the character. In 2006 Dynamite Entertainment published a crossover comic where Darkman teams up with another Sam Raimi creation Ash Williams. =Unaired Television= The character also appears in an unaired TV pilot played by Christopher Bowen, with a similar origin to the movie version with some alterations. In this version while Robert G.Durant (Larry Drake reprising his role) retains his role in causing the explosion that turned Peyton into Darkman, Julie as also killed in the explosion. Darkman then seeks vengeance on Durant and eventually killed him. =Video Games= Darkman was developed by Ocean Software (Painting By Numbers on the NES version, Twilight on the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions) and published by Ocean Software in 1991. It was released for the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Atari ST. It also had two different games of the same name for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name.

Each store, along with golfsmith.com, housed a wide selection of golf clubs, shoes, apparel, gadgets and gear from all the major brands as well as proprietary offerings. They also offered custom club fitting, lessons and services for golfers. Founded by Carl and Barbara Paul in 1967, Golfsmith began as a custom golf club components supplier. As of August 2014, the company had expanded to comprise over 100 retail stores in over 20 states, selling golf clubs, performance apparel, skills improvement products, etc. Golfsmith generated net revenues of over $338 million in fiscal year 2009. In May 2012, Canadian pension fund OMERS announced plans to take over Golfsmith for $6.10 per share, and the transaction was completed in July 2012. OMERS also owns Golf Town, the largest golf retailer in Canada. The two brands operated as Golfsmith International, the largest golf specialty retailer in the world. On November 3, 2016, Golfsmith was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy court of Delaware to be acquired by Dick's Sporting Goods after being purchased for 69 million dollars.  History  In 1967, Carl Paul and his wife Barbara Paul founded Golfsmith in their Edison, N.J. home. Inspired by a custom club maker who had built him a tailor-made set, Carl recognized an unfilled niche in the golf industry: the design and distribution of custom golf clubs and their components, along with instruction about how best to assemble them. Beginning with a typewritten, hand illustrated catalog, Golfsmith first became successful by helping transform club repair shops across the country into custom golf club makers. In the early 1970s, Carl’s brother Frank joined the family business, and it moved to Austin, Texas. The first Golfsmith storefront was a components showroom housed in of unused army barracks. In 1975, the Pauls embarked on their first consumer retail expansion by creating The Golfsmith Store accessory catalog. In 1976, the company first grossed more than $1 million. Golfsmith operated primarily as a catalog-based business until 1992. That year the company moved to its present headquarters location, a 40-acre campus that includes the corporate offices, a practice range, a Golfsmith store, and of shipping and distribution facilities. Golfsmith’s retail expansion began in 1995 with the opening of retail stores in Houston, Denver and Dallas. Golfsmith’s initial public offering of stock was in June 2006. As of August 2014, Golfsmith operated over 100 stores in over 20 states. In October 2002, Golfsmith sold a majority share in the company to First Atlantic Capital. In 2005, Travis Murphy was awarded the Golfsmith International Employee of the Year award and was inducted into the Golfsmith Circle of Excellence. On June 15, 2006, Golfsmith International Holdings Inc. made its initial public offering and since has been traded under NASDAQ symbol GOLF. On September 14, 2016 Golfsmith International Holdings, Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, owing millions to Nike, Inc, Callaway Golf Company, and others. On November 3, 2016, Golfsmith was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy court of Delaware to be acquired by Dick's Sporting Goods after being purchased for 69 million dollars. = Brands = Golfsmith offers golf clubs, apparel, accessories and practice gear from brands like Adams Golf, Adidas, Bridgestone, Bushnell, Callaway, Cleveland, Cobra, ECCO, FootJoy, MacGregor, Mizuno, Nike Golf, Odyssey, OGIO, PING, Scotty Cameron, SkyGolf, Srixon, Sun Mountain, TaylorMade, Titleist, and Wilson Staff. = Proprietary Brands = In 1998, Golfsmith secured a $30 million private placement with DLJ Investment Partners. The private placement helped fund the acquisitions of Lynx Golf Inc., Black Rock Golf Corp. (maker of Killer Bee golf clubs) and Snake Eyes Golf Clubs Inc. In 2003, the company acquired Zevo Golf. In May 2009, Golfsmith acquired the intellectual property rights to MacGregor Golf. Alongside products from external manufacturers, Golfsmith offered complete golf clubs, component club parts, apparel and golf accessories under its own Lynx, MacGregor, Killer Bee, Snake Eyes, Golfsmith, XPC, Zevo, ZTech, Tour Trek, Profinity and MaggieLane brands. = Clubmaking = Beginning in 1970, Golfsmith offered the first golf club maker training programs to teach custom club fitting, assembly and repair. Golfsmith now conducts clubmaking schools throughout the year, at three levels of expertise: the Complete Clubmaker’s Training School, the Advanced Clubmaking, Fitting and Repair School, and the Master Craftsman School. In 1980, Golfsmith established the Golf Clubmakers Association (GCA) to support and guide the growing number of clubmakers around the world. The GCA offers three levels of professional accreditation: Accredited Clubmaker, Professional Clubmaker and Advanced Clubmaker. In 1988, Golfsmith hosted the first GCA International Conference. = Lessons =  Golfsmith Learning Center  In 1993, Golfsmith collaborated with teacher Harvey Penick to develop the Austin-based Harvey Penick Golf Academy, which instructed golfers in the methods and philosophies of the “Little Red Golf Book” coauthor. The academy was renamed the Golfsmith Learning Center in 2009.  Partnership with GolfTEC  In 2004, Golfsmith formed a partnership with GolfTEC, a Denver-based national chain of golf instruction facilities. As of August 2010, GolfTEC provided golf lessons in 57 Golfsmith stores.  Tennis Products and Services  In 2003, Golfsmith acquired six San Francisco-based Don Sherwood Golf and Tennis stores and began offering a wide selection of major-brand tennis merchandise. At one point, the company sold tennis gear in over 55 of its stores nationwide, as well as online and via direct-to-consumer marketing. Golfsmith also offered tennis racquet restringing by technicians certified by the United States Racquet Restringers Association. As of 2013, Golfsmith no longer sold nor serviced tennis related products.  Stores  As of August 2014, Golfsmith operated over 100 stores in over 20 states, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. Golfsmith stores had putting greens, driving ranges and digital swing analysis equipment inside most locations, and tennis courts inside some. In 2009, Golfsmith introduced the Golfsmith Xtreme brand of superstores, which is larger, with more interactive features like indoor hitting bays and sand bunkers.  Bankruptcy/Ceasing of Operations  A few different factors contributed to Golfsmith's bankruptcy, the primary factor being Golfsmith not slowing store openings as its business began to decline. Golfsmith was opening dozens of stores yearly during the 00's while golf was seeing an increase in popularity--mostly attributed to Tiger Woods. Golfsmith took this opportunity to establish itself as the largest golf retailer in North America (164 stores before the bankruptcy). The stores Golfsmith operated were 15,000-40,000 sq. ft each (the average being 23,000 square feet). This led to expensive operating costs, which hurt the company, especially when the golf business began to weaken. Massive amounts of inventory sat in Golfsmith stores losing value as the newer models came out. This was the reason Golfsmith owed $5.5 million to Callaway Golf Co., $5.1 million to Taylormade Golf Co. Inc., $3.5 million to Nike, $2.3 million to PING Inc. and $2.1 million to Titleist. Golfsmith CEO David Roussy blamed \\"a recession-driven decline in golf participation and an oversized brick-and- mortar retail presence\\" for its situation. Golfsmith was purchased at auction by Dick's Sporting Goods. Most Golfsmith stores closed on December 28, 2016. Any remaining Golfsmith stores were converted to Dick's Sporting Goods' Golf Galaxy brand. Hilco Liquidation purchased approximately 80 million dollars of Golfsmith's inventory for approximately 8 million dollars. This led to steady price discounts of everything in the stores, including clubmaking shop tools, hitting bays, shelves, and other fixtures. Hilco dropped prices up to 95% off the original retail price in the final hours of operation.  Website, Mobile Devices and Social Media  Golfsmith’s website, golfsmith.com, offered online shopping, product reviews by customers, streaming videos about products, and services such as golf handicap tracking and live online customer service. In 2007 and 2008, golfsmith.com was cited for exemplary customer service in the E-tailing Group’s annual Mystery Shopping Survey. In 2009 and 2010, Internet Retailer put golfsmith.com on its “Hot 100” list of the best e-commerce sites. In 2010, Golfsmith launched a new mobile website and iPhone application. The company uses both Facebook and Twitter to reach customers.  Catalogs  Golfsmith published and distributed multiple print catalog titles throughout the year, including a general golf equipment catalog, one for custom golf club makers and one offering only tennis products. The company was the first golf retailer to publish a catalog of equipment and fashion exclusively for women.  International Operations  Golfsmith operated Golfsmith Canada LLC, a club components distribution center in Ontario, Canada.

In the Appert topology, the open sets are those that do not contain 1, and those that asymptotically contain almost every positive integer. The space X with the Appert topology is called the Appert space.  Construction  For a subset S of X, let denote the number of elements of S which are less than or equal to n: : \\\\mathrm{N}(n,S) = \\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{ m \\\\in S : m \\\\le n \\\\\\\\} . S is defined to be open in the Appert topology if either it does not contain 1 or if it has asymptotic density equal to 1, i.e., it satisfies :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\text{N}(n,S)}{n} = 1. The empty set is open because it does not contain 1, and the whole set X is open since \\\\text{N}(n,X)/n=1 for all n.  Related topologies  The Appert topology is closely related to the Fort space topology that arises from giving the set of integers greater than one the discrete topology, and then taking the point 1 as the point at infinity in a one point compactification of the space. The Appert topology is finer than the Fort space topology, as any cofinite subset of X has asymptotic density equal to 1. Properties * The closed subsets S of X are those that either contain 1 or that have zero asymptotic density, namely \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\mathrm{N}(n,S)/n = 0. * Every point of X has a local basis of clopen sets, i.e., X is a zero-dimensional space. Proof: Every open neighborhood of 1 is also closed. For any x e 1, \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} is both closed and open. * X is Hausdorff and perfectly normal (T6). Proof: X is T1. Given any two disjoint closed sets A and B, at least one of them, say A, does not contain 1. A is then clopen and A and its complement are disjoint respective neighborhoods of A and B, which shows that X is normal and Hausdorff. Finally, any subset, in particular any closed subset, in a countable T1 space is a Gδ, so X is perfectly normal. * X is countable, but not first countable, and hence not second countable and not metrizable. * A subset of X is compact if and only if it is finite. In particular, X is not locally compact, since there is no compact neighborhood of 1. * X is not countably compact. Proof: The infinite set \\\\\\\\{2^n:n\\\\ge 1\\\\\\\\} has zero asymptotic density, hence is closed in X. Each of its points is isolated. Since X contains an infinite closed discrete subset, it is not limit point compact, and therefore it is not countably compact.  Notes  References * . * .

Photograph from Representative New Mexicans, Vol. I (1912). Frank Wilson Parker (October 16, 1860 – August 3, 1932) was an American judge who served on the New Mexico Supreme Court for 35 years, from its territorial period to after statehood. Parker was born in Sturgis, Michigan, to James W. Parker and Maria Antoinette (Thompson).. He earned a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Michigan Law School in 1880, and practiced law for a year in Sturgis before moving to Mesilla in New Mexico Territory in 1881.. He moved in 1882 to Kingston, a mining town in Sierra County, and then to Hillsboro in 1883.. He served as the Sierra County school superintendent from 1887 to 1889. A Republican, Parker was appointed to serve on the Territorial Supreme Court on January 10, 1898 by President William McKinley, on the recommendation of territorial governor Miguel Antonio Otero... He was reappointed to the Territorial Supreme Court by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 and 1905, and by William Howard Taft in 1909.. While serving as a territorial district court judge,At the time, Territorial Supreme Court justices had trial court as well as appellate duties. he presided over two trials that received national publicity. In 1899, ranchers Oliver Lee and Jim Gilliland were charged with the murder of lawyer and Republican politician Albert J. Fountain and his son, three years after their disappearance. Sheriff Pat Garrett, famous for killing outlaw Billy the Kid, obtained the indictments. The ranchers were defended by Albert Bacon Fall, a Democratic rival of Fountain's, who obtained an acquittal; Fountain's murder was never solved.The trial and the stories of Bacon, Fountain, and Lee are described in detail in . In 1909, Parker presided over the trial of Jesse Wayne Brazel, this time for the murder of Garrett. Fall again represented the defendant, and again obtained an acquittal. Parker served as a member of New Mexico's constitutional convention and as chair of the committee on judiciary. New Mexico achieved statehood in 1912, and Parker was one of the first three justices elected to the Supreme Court. He continued to secure re-election, always running on the Republican ticket, and served on the court until his death in 1932. During his tenure, he served as Chief Justice from 1919 to 1920 and 1922 to 1928. He also served as chair of the state's boundary commission during a boundary dispute with Texas.. In 1923, the New Mexico State Tribune, a pro-Democratic newspaper, suggested that Parker had misused court funds. The paper's editor and publisher, Carl Magee, was subsequently tried and convicted of criminal libel. Parker was married twice. He married Lillian L. Kinney on September 28, 1892; she died on August 11, 1893. They had one daughter, Rosamond Lillian. On October 26, 1904, he married Anna Davis, with whom he had a son, Frank Wilson, Jr. He was a freemason and a member of the Elks Lodge. Parker is buried at Fairview Cemetery in Santa Fe.

Fink taught a course in the Molecular Biology of Yeast at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for 16 years. Many of these students as well as his university students went on to have successful careers in molecular biology.A Conversation with Gerry Fink (7/9/2008) In 1977, Fink and his students Albert Hinnen and Jim Hicks, discovered a method to transform yeast cells, a procedure that allows scientists to introduce genetic material (DNA) from another organism into living yeast cells so that the expression and hereditability of the introduced DNA can be studied.\\"Transformation of yeast.\\" Hinnen A, Hicks JB, and Fink GR, \\"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A\\", 1978 Apr;75(4):1929-33.

Greeks often name as ‘Turks’ various states and groups—such as the Seljuks, the Ottomans, even the Albanians (Turkalvanoi)”. In a broader sense, the term included both Muslim Albanian and Turkish political and military elites of the Ottoman administration in the Balkans. The term is derived from an identification of Muslims with Ottomans and/or Turks, due to the Ottoman Empire's administrative millet system of classifying peoples according to religion, where the Muslim millet played the leading role.Nitsiakos, Vassilis (2010).

I think of how astonished my students always look when I tell them that Ali Pasha was not Turkish but Albanian.

The term has also been noted to be unclear, ideologically and sentimentally charged, and an imperialist and racialist expression.Pettifer James, (2009). Woodhouse, Zerva and the Chams: Exploring Second World War heritage.

In this book Woodhouse laid down the orthodoxy in which the Chams were afterwards seen in British historiography for two generations by adopting the terminology of the Greek extreme Right.\\" Albanians have expressed derision and disassociation toward the terms Turk and its derivative form Turco-Albanian regarding the usage of those terms in reference to them.League of Nations (October 1921). \\"Albania\\".

In reaction, the Albanian utopia crystallized as the logical opposite to that of the Greeks. Emphasizing blood and kinship through the medium of language, it constituted itself as profoundly indifferent to religious divisions-and on these grounds both Western and modern. Greek spokesman Cassavetes conflated Moslem Albanian and Turk, comparing the Greeks in southern Albania to Armenians (1921:473) at the mercy of the \\"Moslem element\\" (1921:471). Albanian official Vrioni responded that, quite to the contrary, Albanians have nothing in common with Turks. There is certainly no such creature as a Turko-Albanian, he argued: \\"The Turk belongs to the Turanian race, whereas the Albanian belongs to an Arian race\\" (1921:478).\\" It has been reported that at the end of the 20th century some Christian Albanians still used the term \\"Turk\\" to refer to Muslim Albanians.Matvey Lomonosov, \\"On Albanian Identity in the Late Ottoman Empire\\", Porta Balkanica, vol. 5, 2013, p.12, Etymology and usage of the term The term Turco-Albanian is a compound made up of the words Turk and Albanian. The word Albanian was and still is a term used as an ethnonym.Lloshi. Albanian. 1999. p. 277. \\"The Albanians of today call themselves shqiptarë, their country Shqipëri, and their language shqipe. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them albanesi (Italian), Albaner (German), Albanians (English), Alvanos (Greek), and Arbanasi (old Serbian), the country Albania, Albanie, Albanien, Alvania, and Albanija, and the language Albanese, Albanisch, Albanian, Alvaniki, and Arbanashki respectively. All these words are derived from the name Albanoi of an Illyrian tribe and their center Albanopolis, noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. Alban could he a plural of alb- arb-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains (ÇABEJ 1976). The name passed over the boundaries of the Illyrian tribe in central Albania, and was generalised for all the Albanians. They called themselves arbënesh, arbëresh, the country Arbëni, Arbëri, and the language arbëneshe, arbëreshe. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by shqiptarë, Shqipëri and shqipe. The primary root is the adverb shqip, meaning “clearly, intelligibly”. There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun Deutsche, “the Germans” and “the German language” (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and Shqipni/Shqipëri is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of Arbëni, Arbëri. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type.

Reference to Muslim Albanian communities as Turco-Albanian is made for those that settled the Peloponnese in order to spread Islam from c. 1715 until after 1770, as part of official Ottoman policy.Nikolaou, 1997, p. 313: \\"Il est à signaler que dans ces contrées s'étaient installés, probablement vers 1715 et après 1770, des Albanais musulmans (Turcalbanais), qui furent l'un des facteurs de diffusion de l'islam.\\" Later in 1770, Muslim Albanian mercenaries referred to as Turco-Albanian were employed by the Ottoman Sultan to suppress the Greek uprising.Nikolaou, 1997, p. 455: \\"L'insurrection de 1770, très mal préparée, a échoué. Cet échec, mais avant tout l'invasion des mercenaires turcalbanais, utilisés par le sultan pour étouffer la révolte, furent lourds de conséquences pour le pays, notamment au niveau économique et démographique. Les effets des destructions causées durant les années critiques de 1770 à 1779 furent bien visibles jusqu'au début du XIX e siècle. [The uprising of 1770, was very ill-prepared and failed. This failure, but above all the invasion of turco-Albanian mercenaries used by the sultan to quell the revolt, were serious consequences for the country, especially in economic and population level. The effects of the destruction caused during the critical years of 1770-1779 were visible until the early nineteenth century.]\\" Their activity included massacres, looting and destruction in the regions of Epirus, Western Macedonia, Central Greece, Thessaly, Peloponnese suffered most destruction and massacre due to the activity of 15,000 Muslim Albanian mercenaries.Nikolaou, 1997, p. 184: Les mercenaires albanais, que la Porte avait utilisés pour la répression de l'insurrection, furent un véritable fléau pour la population grecque. L'Epire, la Macédoine occidentale, la Grèce continentale et surtout la Thessalie, qu'ils traversaient sans cesse en descendant vers le sud ou en revenant chez eux, ont enduré bien des maux : massacres, pillages, destructions, faim. Peut-être que la conséquence la plus douloureuse de cette période fut l'islamisation d'un nombre important d'Epirotes, de Macédoniens et de Thessaliens. Mais le Péloponnèse a souffert plus que toute autre région - pendant et après l'insurrection - car il était envahi, selon les calculs les plus modérés, par 15.000 Albanais environ. [Albanian mercenaries, that the Porte used for the suppression of the uprising, were a scourge for the Greek population. Epirus, Western Macedonia, mainland Greece and especially Thessaly, they crossed constantly down south or returning home, endured many evils: massacres, looting, destruction, hunger. Perhaps the most painful consequence of this period was the Islamization of a significant number of Epirotes, Macedonians and Thessalians. But the Peloponnese suffered more than any other region - during and after the revolution - as it was invaded, according to the most moderate calculations by approximately 15,000 Albanians.]\\"Nikolaou, 1997, p. 174: Nous allons décrire les grandes lignes de l'insurrection de 1770, son étouffement et les conséquences de l'invasion des Turcalbanais dans le Péloponnèse entre 1770 et 1779. Nous jugeons cela tout à fait nécessaire, non seulement parce que les effets directs de cette révolte sont à l'origine, semblet-il, de plusieurs islamisations, mais aussi parce qu'on a pu détecter des conversions juste après l'éclatement de cette révolte. [We will describe the outline of the insurrection of 1770, smothering and the consequences of the invasion of Turco-Albanians in the Peloponnese between 1770 and 1779. We find this very necessary, not only because of the direct effects of this revolt are the cause, it seems, more islamisations but also because we could detect conversion just after the outbreak of the revolt.] In 1779 the Ottoman army finally managed to drive those groups out of Peloponnese, while the remaining ones were either killed by local villagers or found refuge in Muslim Albanian communities in Lala and Vardounia.Nikolaou, 1997, p. 197: Lors de la bataille décisive à Tripolitsa (juillet 1779), les Albanais subirent une défaite totale. Ceux qui survécurent furent ensuite exterminés par les villageois et quelques-uns trouvèrent refuge chez leurs compatriotes turcalbanais à Lala et à Vardounia. [During the decisive battle at Tripolitsa (July 1779), Albanians suffered a total defeat. Those who survived were later exterminated by the villagers and some found refuge among their fellow turco-Albanians Lala and Vardounia.]\\"Nikolaou, 1997, p. 165: \\"Fr. Pouqueville soutient la même position en ajoutant que cette population, tout comme celle des musulmans vardouniotes en Laconie, fut renforcée après 1779 par le reste des mercenaires turcalbanais qui avaient envahi en 1770 le Péloponnèse pour étouffer l'insurrection. [Fr. Pouqueville supports the same position, adding that this population, like that of Muslims Bardouniots in Laconia, was reinforced after 1779 by the remaining turco-Albanian mercenaries who had invaded the Peloponnese in 1770 to quell the insurgency.]\\" The period of 1770-1779 is generally termed as Alvanokratia (Albanian rule) in Greek historiography. As a result, local Greek traditions in Epirus since the late 18th century mention frequent raids and looting by \\"Turko-Albanians\\" or \\"Albanian\\" bands. This kind of activity was connected with the depopulation of settlements. Later, during the Greek War of Independence (1821-1830) reference to Turco-Albanians is made for those Muslim Albanians that fought in the Ottoman side against the Greek revolutionaries. Muslims Albanians are thus often pejoratively named and or called by Greeks as \\"Turks\\", represented in the expression \\"Turkalvanoi\\".Megalommatis, M. Cosmas (1994). Turkish-Greek Relations and the Balkans: A Historian's Evaluation of Today's Problems.

Nation-building and identity in Europe: The dialogics of reciprocity.

Tragically Speaking: On the Use and Abuse of Theory for Life.

All four scholars, for instance, recycled the early modern European usage of \\"Turk\\" as synonymous with both \\"Muslim\\" -regardless of origin-and with \\"Ottoman,\\" while to the Ottomans themselves, the term referred disparagingly to the Anatolian peasantry over whom they had come to rule. Many continue in this habit, one rendered even more confusing and potentially misleading since the Turkish Republic declared all inhabitants to be \\"Turks\\" in order to erase Kurds, Armenians, Laz, and other ethnicities from the national landscape. Acknowledging that the winners write history and that the very instruments of knowledge production were complicit in structures of power and authority, scholars of the Renaissance and early modern period also recognized how Said's analysis of imperial discourses was inappropriate for the era before Europe set out to rule over and colonize Eastern lands.” the expression (rendered also as Turco-Albanian) was employed by some writers mainly in nineteenth and early twentieth century Western European literature regarding Muslim Albanian populations.Blumi, Isa. (1998). \\"The commodification of otherness and the ethnic unit in the Balkans: how to think about Albanians.\\" East European Politics & Societies. 12. (3): 527-569; p. 533. “Such analysis is submerged in a refined treatment of history traditionally skewed for an audience that is more inclined to retain old stereotypes about Albanians, Muslims, and the “other,” than to dig deeper into the intricacies of the homogenized units of analysis being evoked—ethnicity, nation, Islam.” As such, the word Turk within its usage also attained derogatory and derisive meanings that when applied to other words created pejorative meanings of cruel and inhumane behavior and or of being backward and savage.McCarthy, Kevin M. (1970). “The Derisive Use of Turk and Turkey”. American Speech. 45. (1/2): 157. \\"Among the nationalities that seem to have been disparaged throughout history, the Turks hold a prominent place. The name Turk or Turkey has long been associated with cruel, inhuman behavior and has often been used as a descriptive part of our speech in derogatory phrases.\\"; p. 158. \\"As a noun in the English language Turk has meant, according to the OED, ‘a cruel, rigorous, or tyrannical man; any one behaving as a barbarian or savage; one who treats his wife hardly; a bad- tempered or unmanageable man.’\\"; p. 159. \\"Since it has such a tradition of derisive meanings, I was not surprised when I came across a recent application of turk, this time in the field of sports: turk is a nickname that professional football players have given to the bad news that they have been cut from the squad. Such an example points out the fact that, while many ethnic groups have served as the butt of jokes and the object of derision in particular periods of our history (for example, the Poles, Italians, Jews, and Irish), the Turks alone have generally been a constant target for derision and have unwillingly lent their name to many unfavorable situations.\\"Batur- VanderLippe, Pinar (1999). \\"Centering on global racism and antiracism: from everyday life to global complexity.\\" Sociological spectrum. 19. (4): 472. “In the centuries-old stereotype of the “Terrible Turk,” Turks were pictured as the backward and savage enemies of civilization and progress. Whether the Terrible Turk was conceptualized as White or Black, the essential Orientalist categories of “backward” and “savage” always accompanied “darkness,” qualities in stark contrast to the self-image of the colonizer as white, progressive, scientific, and superior (VanderLippe 1997).”Todorova, Maria Nikolaeva (1997). Imagining the Balkans. Oxford University Press. p.90. “English images of the Turk during the sixteenth and much of the seventeenth centuries were ones of tyranny, arbitrariness, extortions, slavery, piracy savage punishments, and Christian ordeals; they were also images of strangeness and diatribe against Islam.” Within a Balkans context during the twentieth century, the usage of the word \\"Turk\\" (and \\"Turkey\\") has also been politically employed to differentiate the “indigenous” from the “alien” that interpreted Balkan Muslims as “foreigners”.Blumi, Isa (2013). Ottoman refugees, 1878-1939: migration in a post-imperial world. A&C; Black. pp. 149-150. “It all started with war. War was the means by which new political elites in neighboring, former Ottoman territories like Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia identified an opportunity to rewrite the demographic landscape and in turn, claim a historical association with newly “ethnically cleansed” territories. As a consequence of the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, in particular, entire city neighborhoods were razed, names of villages changed, their inhabitants expelled, or more dramatically still, collectively “converted.” To many, the problem was that the beginning of World War I left these states not enough time to complete the ugly task of erasing the Ottoman Empire from “Christendom.” As in the Americas, an Ottoman human “refuse” lingered in independent Balkan countries where some of these “left-over” communities survive until today. Despite a long period of imposed socialism and declarations of brotherhood, Balkan Muslims lived in constant fear that one more round of “ethnic cleansing” will come sweeping through their communities. This is especially the case in Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia, where a century now of living as “minorities” often led to opportunistic, “functional” blood-letting campaigns in the larger contexts of “national” politics. In Yugoslavia, the non-Slav Albanian Muslim (and Catholic) evolved into a bureaucratic category especially susceptible to periodic state-led expulsion campaigns—throughout the 1920s, 1935–8, 1953–67, and then again in the 1990s—that passed through the region. Invariably castigated as “outsiders” and “fifth-column” threats to national security, the labeling of entire regions of Kosovo, Novipazaar, Montenegro, and Macedonia as inhabited by generic “Muslim Albanians” often meant the organized expulsion of those communities. In order to justify such measures to an occasional outside traveler bearing witness to the violent process, or delegations sent by the newly created League of Nations at the request of Albania (a member state), the Serbian/ Yugoslav state often rolled out historians, demographers, and anthropologists. In an often repeated exercise throughout the post-Ottoman Balkans, operatives of “ethnic cleansing” campaigns resurrected the “professional knowledge” of race sciences first developed in the United States at the turn-of-the-century. In the 1920s, for instance, state authorities eager to continue a process of expulsion started in 1912—briefly disrupted by World War I—sent an army of European-trained ethnographers to “Southern Serbia” to identify those communities least likely to ever accept Serbian rule. These ethnographers and human geographers adopted many of the same racist epistemologies identified in other Euro-American contexts to identify and catalogue the “sub-human” characteristics of hybrid “Turks” whose very “nature” made efforts to assimilate them into a modernizing Serbian/South Slav society “scientifically” impossible. While these stories now make up a core aspect of Albanian (and Turkish, Greek, Bulgarian) historical memory vis-à-vis Serbia’s torment, it has usefully been forgotten that the dynamics around such systemic violence was informed by a set of ideological and disciplinary frameworks that, once instrumentalized, as by the CUP after 1910, transformed the way once heterogeneous societies interacted with each other. These same ideological principles based on racial segregation and biological hierarchies influenced the intellectual elite of the early twentieth-century world. They ultimately mobilized a so-called fertility politics to justify why violent state-led colonialization/expulsion in Yugoslavia (and earlier in Greece and Bulgaria) was necessary in order to maintain the long-term demographic balance of society. Forced expulsion, the signing of “population exchange” agreements—popularized as a diplomatic “solution” already in the immediate aftermath of the first Balkan War of 1912—and ultimately colonization were all tactics used in the Balkans, as well as throughout the Euro-American dominated world.”Blumi, Isa (2011). Reinstating the Ottomans, Alternative Balkan Modernities: 1800-1912. Palgrave MacMillan. New York. p. 32. \\"As state policy, post- Ottoman “nations” continue to sever most of their cultural, socioeconomic, and institutional links to the Ottoman period. At times, this requires denying a multicultural history, inevitably leading to orgies of cultural destruction (Kiel 1990; Riedlmayer 2002). As a result of this strategic removal of the Ottoman past—the expulsion of the “Turks” (i.e., Muslims); the destruction of buildings; the changing of names of towns, families, and monuments; and the “purification” of languages—many in the region have accepted the conclusion that the Ottoman cultural, political, and economic infrastructure was indeed an “occupying,” and thus foreign, entity (Jazexhi 2009). Such logic has powerful intuitive consequences on the way we write about the region’s history: If Ottoman Muslims were “Turks” and thus “foreigners” by default, it becomes necessary to differentiate the indigenous from the alien, a deadly calculation made in the twentieth century with terrifying consequences for millions.\\" With the case of the Albanians, this at times has resulted in Albanophobia, negative stereotyping, socio-political discrimination and even mass violence.Austin, Robert Clegg (2012). Founding a Balkan State: Albania's Experiment with Democracy, 1920-1925. University of Toronto Press. p. 95. “A cornerstone of Greek policy, an approach also employed by the Yugoslavs, was to encourage religious differences in Albania and stress that Albania was a little ‘Turkey’ hostile to Orthodox Greeks. To popularize the idea of two Albanian states, one Moslem, the other Christian, throughout the early 1920s Greece continually complained that Albania’s majority Moslem population was actively persecuting the Orthodox minority. Albania denied this, stressed its well— documented legacy of religious tolerance, and added that while there was tension in the southern perimeter of the country, it was not between Muslims and Christians, but rather a rift had emerged because of the movement to create an autocephalous Albanian Orthodox Church and some citizens wished to remain under the Patriarchate”.Müller, Dietmar (2009). \\"Orientalism and Nation: Jews and Muslims as Alterity in Southeastern Europe in the Age of Nation-States, 1878–1941.\\" East Central Europe. 36. (1): 66. “Therefore, the Romanian and Serbian intellectuals and politicians considered themselves perfectly in line with the Occident’s mission civilisatrice when denying the Jews the citizenship, when driving out Turks and Albanians, initiating processes to “de-Orientalize” social practices, certain ethnical and religious groups, or whole provinces. More specifically, the Romanian legitimizing discourse directed towards the Great Powers ran as follows: Romanian citizenship could be granted to the Jews only when they had reached the heights of European culture; in the contrary case, Romania could not fulfill its mission civilisatrice in the Balkans. Equally Orientalistic was the Serbian discourse, which claimed as national duty to Europeanize Muslims and Albanians, or at least the territories inhabited by them.Merdjanova, Ina (2013). Rediscovering the Umma: Muslims in the Balkans between nationalism and transnationalism. Oxford University Press. p. 43. \\"Immediately after the establishment of the communist regime, Albanian language schools were opened in both Kosovo and Macedonia, yet a few years later the Yugoslav government launched a crackdown on Albanian self- determination by closing most of the schools and banning Albanian national symbols and holidays. Albanians were encouraged to identify as “Turks” and new Turkish schools were opened, while a 1953 governmental treaty with Turkey, allowing the Turks in Yugoslavia to emigrate, unleashed a massive exodus to Turkey. Many Albanian and Slavic Muslims represented themselves as Turks in order to leave the country.\\"Salla, Michael Emin (1998). \\"Traveling the full circle: Serbia's ‘final solution’ to the Kosovo problem.\\" Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. 18.

The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenia, dominated by the Serbian Karadjeodjic dynasty, began a systematic policy of repression and forced emigration of Albanians in an effort to ‘correct’ the demographic nature of the territories. Many Muslim Albanians were simply categorised as Turks and expelled to Turkey, as part of an agreement between Turkey and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenia. Estimates of Albanians forced to emigrate to desolate regions of Anatolia to form a dependable buffer population for Turkey go as high as 250,000 while 50,000 emigrated to Albania proper.”Hilaj, Arjan (2013). \\"The Albanian National Question and the Myth of Greater Albania.\\" The Journal of Slavic Military Studies. 26.(3): 8. “In the aftermath of World War I, Greece considered all Albanian Muslims in Çamëria as Turks, and therefore transferred them to Turkey with other Turkish nationals, following the international treaty signed between the two states in 1923 at Lausanne.”Baltsiotis.

The central Greek state was eager to push the “hostile” population to migrate to Turkey. To that end it utilized harassment tactics which were carried out by local paramilitary groups. This was a practice that was well known and had been adopted as early as the period of the Balkan Wars. In other cases it just forced people to leave the country, after handing down ultimatums.”Tzanelli, Rodanthi (2010). “Islamophobia and Hellenophilia: Greek Myths of Post-colonial Europe”.

While all Croats were increasingly becoming associated with the Ustasha, Kosovar Albanians and Bosniaks were referred to as “Turks,” implying their supposed collaboration with Serbia’s historic enemy despite the fact that many Albanians had actually fought with the Serbs against the Ottoman invasion and that Bosnia’s Muslims are ethnically Slavs.”; p. 400. “After the outbreak of the war in 1991, the State Council of Education in Belgrade introduced new history textbooks in the elementary and secondary schools. As Dubravka Stojanović has shown, these textbooks cast Serbs as the perennial victims of their neighbors, and, using emotionally charged language in describing certain periods, offered pupils a picture of the world “brimming with xenophobic contempt and hatred for neighboring nations, [as well as for the] European and the world community.” In discussions of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled Serbia for roughly four centuries, the Christian subjects are described as “the enslaved peoples,” with every lesson “followed by a short passage taken from historical sources in which those who commit the described actions (usually atrocities) are called Turks.” Needless to say, there is no mention of the fact that, for most of this period, the Ottomans were more tolerant of both confessional diversity and linguistic diversity than any other state in Europe, with the partial exception of Prussia.”Clark, Howard (2000). Civil resistance in Kosovo. Pluto Press. p.xx. “The claim to be ‘autochthonous’ has particular importance because Serbian authorities, regarding this as an Austrian-instilled myth, treat Albanians as immigrants and twice In the twentieth century they have sought to ‘repatriate’ Albanians to Turkey. Whatever their origins, Albanians and Serbs have coexisted in Kosovo for centuries.”Moe, Christian (2014). \\"Religion in the Yugoslav conflicts: post-war perspectives.\\" Scripta Instituti Donneriani Aboensis. 19: 263-264. In Sells’s interpretation the national mythology thus ‘portrays Slavic Muslims as Christ killers and race traitors’ (1996: 27), identifies them with the Turks who killed Lazar, and unleashes on them the same violence that the blood libel called forth against Jews (p. xv). Sells likens the Serbian government’s use of nationalist propaganda and religious symbols around the commemoration of the 600th anniversary of the Kosovo battle (1989) to the medieval passion play, with its ability to collapse time and incite the audience to commit pogroms. He further interprets the Mountain Wreath as placing the killings ‘explicitly outside the category of the blood feud’, as the Muslim offer of a traditional ceremony of reconciliation is rejected by the Christians on the grounds that it requires baptism. Instead, the conflict becomes a ‘cosmic duality of good and evil’. Killing the ‘Turkifiers’ is explicitly referred to as a ‘baptism by blood’, and Sells argues, questionably, that the poem portrays this killing as ‘an act sacred in itself’ that is not sinful but cleansing (Sells 1996: 42–3) – here, we return to the notion of ‘atrocity as sacrament’. What matters is not whether this is a plausible reading of the 1847 poem, but whether similar readings informed behaviour in the 1990s, a question to be settled empirically. In any case, this only accounts for the demonising of Muslim Bosniaks and Albanians, not for the Croat–Serb conflict.”Mertus, Julie (1999). Kosovo: How myths and truths started a war. University of California Press. p. 184-185. “The importance of the Kosovo myth to Serbian politics, as Gale Stokes has observed, “lies not in these actual histories but in its selection by the nationalists as the appropriate symbolic universe of Serbianness. It provides a vocabulary of experiences outside of time.” In 1989, the “great defeat” served as a reminder of Serbian suffering and the need for Serbs to defend even their motherland, Kosovo. Mention of the Ottoman Empire also triggered the image of the evil Turks — shorthand for all Muslims, including Kosovo Albanians (regardless of their religion) and Yugoslav (“Slavic”) Muslims, who were considered to be race traitors for converting to Islam during Ottoman rule. Milošević had long capitalized on the “vocabulary of experiences” created by the myth of Kosovo. For him, the anniversary extravaganza for the Battle of Kosovo was tailor made. He arrived at the ceremony by helicopter in a display of power and took the place of honor on a stage decorated with the emblems of Serbian nationalism — including an enormous Orthodox Cross encircled by four Cyrillic C’s (for the slogan “Only Unity/Harmony Saves the Serbs”). The entire federal leadership was in attendance to hear his warning: “Serbs in their history have never conquered or exploited others. Through two world wars, they liberated themselves and, when they could, they also helped other people to liberate themselves. The Kosovo heroism does not allow us to forget that at one time we were brave and dignified and one of the few who went into battle undefeated. Six centuries later, again we are in battles and quarrels. They are not armed battles, though such things cannot be excluded yet.” By capitalizing on the greatest myth in Serbian folklore, Milošević pitted Serbs not only against Albanians but also against the other enemy identified by the Kosovo myth: Slavic Muslims. It would be the last time the entire federal leadership would stand on the same stage in unity with Milošević.”Brunnbauer, Ulf (2004). \\"Fertility, families and ethnic conflict: Macedonians and Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia, 1944–2002.\\" Nationalities papers. 32. (3): 583. “Once communist power was established, the Albanians, and the Muslim communities in general, felt increasingly alienated from the state, for example, because of its anti- religious agenda, its ethnic Macedonian outlook, the strong Serbian influence, and its radical attempts to change the role of women…. This alienation from socialist transformation was among the reasons why thousands of Albanians emigrated as “Turks” to Turkey in the 1950s. Hence, the effects of discrimination by state authorities were multiplied by those of self- isolation.” Usage in Greek media and literature At the beginning of the 1880s the Greek press openly used the term \\"Turco-Albanian brigands\\" to incite hate speech and to associate Albanian nationalists with \\"Turkish anti-Greek propaganda\\". During the years 1882-1897 some Greek media and publications initiated a campaign to promote friendship and a potential future alliance between Greeks and Albanians. As such they avoided the use of the term Turco- Albanian and pointed to the common features shared by both populations. New mixed terms Greek-Albanians and Greek-Pelasgians were used instead. The term Turco-Albanian after the Greek War of Independence was also sometimes used in 19th century Greek school text books for Muslim Albanians.Spahiu, Nexhmedin (2008). \\" The National Awakening process and the Orthodox Albanians.\\" Forum Bosnae. 44: 307-308. After the independence of Greece, Greek schools in Albania were organized and furnished with new personnel, programs, and school books by the new Hellenic state. The history and literature taught in these schools indoctrinated pupils with Hellenic chauvinism towards the Muslims - a term that was used by them as a synonym for Turks. They considered Albanian Muslims not to be Albanians or Albanian Muslims, but just Muslims, i.e. Turks or sometimes Turcoalvanoi (Turco-albanians). The fact that there were Catholic Albanians in northern Albania was irrelevant to the Greeks, because that part was too far from the imagined future borders of the Hellenic state. Greek nationalist histories still uses the more widely known pejorative term Turco- Albanian instead of Muslim Albanians. Relative terms Various Muslim Albanian communities by Greeks were similarly also labelled such as the Turco- Bardouniots (or Τουρκοβαρδουνιώτες, Tourko-Vardouniotes).Nikolaou, 1997, p. 313 and Turco-Chams (or Τουρκοτσάμηδες, Tourko-tsamides)Kretsi, Georgia (2002). \\"The Secret Past of the Greek-Albanian Borderlands.

Ethnologia Balkanica. 6: 173. \\"The Greek population often refers to the Chams as “Turks” or “Turkalbanians”, indicating that they are Muslims.\\" In Thesprotia older designations based on religion were used for Albanian Muslim Chams by the local Orthodox population who referred to them as \\"Turks\\" (i.e: Muslims), a term still used in the region by some elderly people.. p. 36 \\"Σε ό,τι αφορά τη λαϊκή γλώσσα, για τον προσδιορισμό της θρησκευτικής ταυτότητας στην περιοχή της Θεσπρωτίας (όπως και αλλού), επικρατούσε, τουλάχιστον μέχρι την κατοχή, ο όρος Τούρκοι για την αναφορά σε Μουσουλμάνους, ανεξαρτήτως καταγωγής, γλώσσας και εθνότητας. Ο ίδιος προσδιορισμός είναι σε χρήση ακόμη και σήμερα από άτομα της τρίτης ηλικίας που ζουν στην περιοχή.\\" (In the popular language, for the characterization of the religious identity in Thesprotia (as well as elsewhere), it was common, at least till the German Occupation, the term \\"Turks\\" for the muslims, independently of origin, language and nationality. The same characterization is still used today by elderly people living in the area.) The term Turco- Albanian was also used by both British intelligence and the German army for Muslim Albanian Chams during World War Two and it was borrowed from Greek usage.Tönnes, Bernhard (1980).

Amongst the wider Greek-speaking population, until the interwar period of the twentieth century, the term Arvanitis (plural: Arvanites) was used to describe an Albanian speaker, regardless of their religious affiliations, including Islam. On the other hand, within Greek Epirus, the term Arvanitis is still used for an Albanian speaker, regardless of their citizenship and religion. \\"Until the Interwar period Arvanitis (plural Arvanitēs) was the term used by Greek speakers to describe an Albanian speaker regardless of his/hers religious background. In official language of that time the term Alvanos was used instead.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 23 August 1972, and was vested in the Trust on 26 March 1974. The church was built of knapped flint, brick and tile with a pyramid spire, by John Loughborough Pearson for the Fowle family. At the time there were 188 parishioners. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury on 15 August 1872. The nave and aisles are spanned by a single roof. There are encaustic tiles on the raised floor of the chancel. The roof is of open trussed timber rafters. There is a three-stage tower topped with the spire which is a highly visible from the surrounding area. The church had six bells cast in 1871 by Mears & Stainbank of Whitechapel Bell Foundry. In 1976 these were removed and rehung in the Church of St Nicholas in Chute. The west window includes stained glass by Clayton and Bell a partnership of John Richard Clayton (London, 1827–1913) and Alfred Bell (Silton, Dorset, 1832–95). The west window has glass also from 1914 but in a different style. There is a wall tablet to Frank G. Fowle who died in 1942. The parish was merged with that of Chute in 1954.

He is inscribed in Zrinjski Mostar history as the manager who \\"brought\\" the first Bosnian Premier League title to the club. The victory was even more immense because it was won in the 2004–05 season, which marked the one hundredth anniversary of Zrinjski. Playing career Born in Mostar, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, present day Bosnia and Herzegovina, Džidić started playing football in 1955. His father was a miner and lived in a mining colony beside local team Velež Mostar's old stadium (today's \\"Old Veležovo\\" or \\"Old Playground\\", a neighborhood in the city of Mostar) and began to train in a football school of Velež. In 1958, Džidić made his first appearance for the first team of Velež. He played for Velež until 1969, after which he joined Borac Čapljina where he remained for three seasons. He had some offers to go abroad, but decided to stay in Yugoslavia, where he remained until the end of his playing career. In 1972, Džidić joined Mladost Lištica, today known as Široki Brijeg, on a player-manager type contract. Džidić ended his playing career and ultimately stepped down as manager in 1974. Managerial career Džidić became a manager after ending his playing career, working as a player-manager at Mladost Lištica, today known as Široki Brijeg, Lokomotiva Mostar and Borac Čapljina, after which for six years he was an assistant manager at Velež Mostar. He assisted Vukašin Višnjevac, Miloš Milutinović and Muhamed Mujić. With Milutinović he won the Yugoslav Cup in 1981, beating Željezničar in the final. One year Džidić was also a football instructor at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then went to Trebinje to manager Leotar. He spent four years in Leotar, making remarkable success. Trebinje is enriched for football and created plenty of players who later earned a football reputation and knowledge. Basically he took the players from Mostar, who could not play in Velež and then gained prominence in Leotar. These were: Ibrahim Rahimić, Lučić, Ronćević and Stipe Jurić. After 4 years in Trebinje, Džidić left Leotar. After Leotar, he went to Iskra Bugojno and spendt there for two years. Then he returned to the Velež team consisting of: Meho Kodro, Joško Popović, Igor Musa and so on. Džidić was also the last manager of Velež before the Bosnian War. After the war, he first went to, at the time, Croatian 1. HNL club Šibenik. After Šibenik, he did a half-season in Samobor, which was then in the 2. HNL, and then returned to Mostar. Then Džidić became manager of HNK Cim and won first place in the Second League of Herzeg-Bosnia, without losing a game. From Cim he went back to Široki Brijeg and in one season won two the First League of Herzeg-Bosnia. After that he was named manager of Zrinjski Mostar. Džidić for the first time led Zrinjski in the 1997–98 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina play-offs. From the First League of Herzeg-Bosnia, Zrinjski and Široki Brijeg were put in two groups where they waited their respective opponents of each group, for Sarajevo and Čelik Zenica. Zrinjski in the final competition suffered two defeats and failed to qualify for the play-offs final. In 2003, Džidić came back to Zrinjski but shortly after got sacked due to poor results. In 2004, he once again came back to Zrinjski. That proved to be the right choice, since Džidić led the Zrinjski teem to win first place in the Bosnian Premier League in the 2004–05 season, with it going down in history as the first title in Zrinjski's history for the club's one hundredth anniversary. After leaving Zrinjski, he worked as manager at Ljubuški and Redarstvenik Mostar. Džidić then decided to end his managerial career, working only as head od the youth football schools of, first Široki Brijeg, and then Zrinjski.

Ingber's early scientific work led to the discovery that tensegrity architecture \\\\- first described by the architect Buckminster Fuller and the sculptor Kenneth Snelson - is a fundamental design principle that governs how living systems are structured, from individual molecules and cells to whole tissues, organs and organisms. Ingber's work on tensegrity led him to propose that mechanical forces play as important a role in biological control as chemicals and genes do, and to investigate the molecular mechanism by which cells convert mechanical signals into changes in intracellular biochemistry and gene expression, a process known as \\"mechanotransduction.\\" Ingber determined that living cells use tensegrity architecture to stabilize their shape and cytoskeleton, that cellular integrins function as mechanosensors on the cell surface, and that cytoskeletal tension (or \\"prestress,\\" which is central to the stability of tensegrity structures) is a fundamental regulator of many cellular responses to mechanical cues. Ingber's tensegrity theory also led to the prediction in the early 1980s that changes in extracellular matrix structure and mechanics play a fundamental role in tissue and organ development, and that deregulation of this form of developmental control can promote cancer formation. Ingber's contributions in translational medicine include discovery of one of the first angiogenesis inhibitor compounds (TNP-470) to enter clinical trials for cancer, creation of tissue engineering scaffolds that led to clinical products, development of a dialysis-like blood cleansing device for treatment of blood stream infections that is moving towards clinical testing,Phillip, Abby (September 16, 2014). \\"From E. coli to Ebola: A device that can filter deadly pathogens out of the body\\", The Washington Post. creation of a mechanically-activated nanotechnology for targeting clot-busting drugs to sites of vascular occlusion, and co- development of a new surface coating based on Slippery Liquid Infused Porous Surfaces (SLIPS) for medical devices and implants that could eliminate the conventional dependency on anticoagulant drugs that pose life-threatening side-effect risks. One of his more recent innovations is the creation of tiny, complex, three-dimensional models of living human organs, known as \\"organs-on- chips\\" (Organ Chips), which mimic complicated human organ functions in vitro as a way to potentially replace traditional animal-based methods for testing of drugs and toxins. The first human Organ Chip, a human Lung Chip, was reported in Science in 2010. Created using microchip manufacturing methods, the Lung Chip is a complex three-dimensional model of a breathing lung that incorporates living human lung alveolar epithelial cells interfaced with endothelial cells within microfluidic channels cast in silicone rubber, which recapitulate structure and function of the tissue-vasculature interface of lung alveolus (air sacs). In 2012, Ingber and his team demonstrated in a study in Science Translational Medicine the ability to mimic a complex human disease on the Lung Chip — specifically pulmonary edema, known commonly as “fluid on the lungs” — and to identify new therapeutics using this model. As an alternative to animal studies, Organ Chips could be used to study the safety and efficacy of new drugs, accelerating the introduction of new drugs to market while significantly lowering research costs. Ingber's group has since expanded this technology to develop other model organs, including the intestine, kidney, bone marrow, blood-brain barrier, and liver. In 2012, Ingber's team was awarded a DARPA contract to string together multiple Organ Chips to build an automated human body-on-chips that will recapitulate whole- body physiology. This system could be used in combination with computational modeling to rapidly assess responses to new drug candidates, providing critical information on their safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics. Other new technologies from Ingber's lab include development of a fully biodegradable plastic alternative inspired by natural cuticle material found in shrimp shells and insect exoskeletons, known as “Shrilk”; a mechanically activated nanotherapeutic that selectively directs clot-busting drugs to sites of vascular occlusion while minimizing unintended bleeding; an siRNA nanoparticle therapy that prevents breast cancer progression; a dialysis-like sepsis device that cleanses blood of all infectious pathogens, fungi and toxins without requiring prior identification; a surface coating for medical materials and devices that prevents clot formation and bacteria accumulation that reduces the need for use of conventional anticoagulant drugs that frequently result in life-threatening side effects, and a computational approach to diagnostics and therapeutics that incorporates both animation and molecular modeling software to virtually develop and test potential drugs designed to fit precisely into their targets’ molecular structures. Leadership and public service Earlier in his career, Ingber helped to bridge Harvard University, its affiliated hospitals, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) through his involvement in the Center for Integration in Medicine and Innovative Technology, Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. He also has been a member of the Center for Nanoscale Systems and the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at Harvard, as well as the MIT Center for Bioengineering. In 2009, Ingber was named Founding Director of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, which was launched with a $125 million gift— which at the time was the largest philanthropic gift in Harvard's history—from Swiss philanthropist and entrepreneur Hansjörg Wyss. The Wyss Institute was founded to enable high-risk research and disruptive innovation, and to catalyze the field of biologically inspired engineering in which newly uncovered biological design principles are leveraged to develop new engineering innovations in the form of bioinspired materials and devices for medicine, industry, and the environment. The Institute is a partnership among Harvard University, its major affiliated hospitals (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital), Boston University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tufts University, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and University of Zurich. Ingber is a member of the National Academy of Medicine, the National Academy of Inventors, the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as a member of the Space Studies Board of the U.S. National Research Council (NRC), which advises the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and National Institute of Medicine, and he chaired its Committee on Space Biology and Medicine. He has been an external reviewer of multiple NRC reports, including “Plan for the International Space Station,” “Future Biotechnology Research on the International Space Station,” \\"Assessment of Directions in Microgravity and Physical Sciences Research at NASA\\", and “The Astrophysical Context of Life.” Ingber also has served as a consultant to numerous companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and cosmetics industries, including Merck, Roche, Astrazeneca, Biogen, Chanel, and L’Oreal, among others.

The red (right) side is the North pole, the green (left) side is the South pole. The demagnetizing field, also called the stray field (outside the magnet), is the magnetic field (H-field)In this article the term 'magnetic field' is used for the magnetic 'H field' while 'magnetic flux density' is used for the magnetic 'B-field'. generated by the magnetization in a magnet. The total magnetic field in a region containing magnets is the sum of the demagnetizing fields of the magnets and the magnetic field due to any free currents or displacement currents. The term demagnetizing field reflects its tendency to act on the magnetization so as to reduce the total magnetic moment. It gives rise to shape anisotropy in ferromagnets with a single magnetic domain and to magnetic domains in larger ferromagnets. The demagnetizing field of an arbitrarily shaped object requires a numerical solution of Poisson's equation even for the simple case of uniform magnetization. For the special case of ellipsoids (including infinite cylinders) the demagnetization field is linearly related to the magnetization by a geometry dependent constant called the demagnetizing factor. Since the magnetization of a sample at a given location depends on the total magnetic field at that point, the demagnetization factor must be used in order to accurately determine how a magnetic material responds to a magnetic field. (See magnetic hysteresis.) Magnetostatic principles =Maxwell's equations= In general the demagnetizing field is a function of position . It is derived from the magnetostatic equations for a body with no electric currents.If there are electric currents in the system, they can be calculated separately and added to the solutions of these equations. These are Ampère's law and Gauss's law The magnetic field and flux density are related by where \\\\mu_0 is the permeability of vacuum and is the magnetisation. =The magnetic potential= The general solution of the first equation can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential : Inside the magnetic body, the potential is determined by substituting () and () in (): Outside the body, where the magnetization is zero, At the surface of the magnet, there are two continuity requirements: *The component of parallel to the surface must be continuous (no jump in value at the surface). *The component of perpendicular to the surface must be continuous. This leads to the following boundary conditions at the surface of the magnet: {\\\\partial n} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial U_\\\\text{out}}{\\\\partial n} + \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n}. \\\\end{align}|}} Here is the surface normal and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\left(\\\\partial/ \\\\partial n\\\\right) is the derivative with respect to distance from the surface. The outer potential must also be regular at infinity: both and must be bounded as goes to infinity. This ensures that the magnetic energy is finite. Sufficiently far away, the magnetic field looks like the field of a magnetic dipole with the same moment as the finite body. =Uniqueness of the demagnetizing field= Any two potentials that satisfy equations (), () and (), along with regularity at infinity, are identical. The demagnetizing field is the gradient of this potential (equation ). =Energy= The energy of the demagnetizing field is completely determined by an integral over the volume of the magnet: Suppose there are two magnets with magnetizations and . The energy of the first magnet in the demagnetizing field of the second is The reciprocity theorem states that =Magnetic charge and the pole-avoidance principle= Formally, the solution of the equations for the potential is {|\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}'|}dV' + \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi}\\\\int_\\\\text{surface} \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{M\\\\left(r'\\\\right)}}{|\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}'|}dS',|}} where is the variable to be integrated over the volume of the body in the first integral and the surface in the second, and is the gradient with respect to this variable. Qualitatively, the negative of the divergence of the magnetization (called a volume pole) is analogous to a bulk bound electric charge in the body while (called a surface pole) is analogous to a bound surface electric charge. Although the magnetic charges do not exist, it can be useful to think of them in this way. In particular, the arrangement of magnetization that reduces the magnetic energy can often be understood in terms of the pole-avoidance principle, which states that the magnetization tries to reduce the poles as much as possible. Effect on magnetization =Single domain= File:SingleDomainMagneticCharges.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of the magnetic charges at the surface of a single-domain ferromagnet. The arrows indicate the direction of magnetization. The thickness of the colored region indicates the surface charge density. default direct SVG link One way to remove the magnetic poles inside a ferromagnet is to make the magnetization uniform. This occurs in single-domain ferromagnets. This still leaves the surface poles, so division into domains reduces the poles further. However, very small ferromagnets are kept uniformly magnetized by the exchange interaction. The concentration of poles depends on the direction of magnetization (see the figure). If the magnetization is along the longest axis, the poles are spread across a smaller surface, so the energy is lower. This is a form of magnetic anisotropy called shape anisotropy. =Multiple domains= Illustration of a magnet with four magnetic closure domains. The magnetic charges contributed by each domain are pictured at one domain wall. The charges balance, so the total charge is zero. If the ferromagnet is large enough, its magnetization can divide into domains. It is then possible to have the magnetization parallel to the surface. Within each domain the magnetization is uniform, so there are no volume poles, but there are surface poles at the interfaces (domain walls) between domains. However, these poles vanish if the magnetic moments on each side of the domain wall meet the wall at the same angle (so that the components are the same but opposite in sign). Domains configured this way are called closure domains. Demagnetizing factor An arbitrarily shaped magnetic object has a total magnetic field that varies with location inside the object and can be quite difficult to calculate. This makes it very difficult to determine the magnetic properties of a material such as, for instance, how the magnetization of a material varies with the magnetic field. For a uniformly magnetized sphere in a uniform magnetic field the internal magnetic field is uniform: where is the magnetization of the sphere and is called the demagnetizing factor and equals for a sphere. This equation can be generalized to include ellipsoids having principal axes in x, y, and z directions such that each component has a relationship of the form: Other important examples are an infinite plate (an ellipsoid with two of its axes going to infinity) which has = in a direction normal to the plate and zero otherwise and an infinite cylinder (an ellipsoid with one of its axes tending toward infinity with the other two being the same) which has = 0 along its axis and perpendicular to its axis.For tables or equations for the magnetizing factors of the general ellipsoid see The demagnetizing factors are the principal values of the depolarization tensor, which gives both the internal and external values of the fields induced in ellipsoidal bodies by applied electric or magnetic fields.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The district derives it name from two different colleges that were located here in the 19th century. History Civil War Monument Iowa College was founded in 1846 by members of the Congregational Church on Western Avenue in Davenport. The land was donated by Antoine LeClaire, one of the city's founders. The school started as a college preparatory school and eventually added a collegiate department. The city decided to extend Western Avenue through the campus so the school moved further east in 1855 to where Central High School is now located. It was at that time that the property was first called College Square. with That year they built a new stone building and boarding house for $22,000. Once again the city council voted to extend Main Street through the campus and in 1858 the trustees decided to move to Grinnell, Iowa in 1859 where the school was renamed Grinnell College. The following year the school property was purchased by Henry Washington Lee, the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Iowa for $36,000. He established Griswold College on the west side of the property. It too contained preparatory and collegiate divisions as well as a seminary department. The college started well at the beginning, but began to have financial problems as a result of the Panic of 1873 and started to decline. Kemper Hall, a college preparatory school for boys, was founded on the property. By the end of the 19th century, the schools were officially closed by the diocese. On the east side of the property, Bishop Lee built Grace Cathedral, which is now known as Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. The diocese sold the property on the west side of Main Street to the Davenport Board of Education for $53,000. They built Davenport High School on the property between 1904-1907. The north part of the district is largely occupied by houses that were built largely in the two decades following the American Civil War. In the middle of the district is the city's Civil War soldier's monument. Also adjacent to the historic district is Palmer College of Chiropractic. The College Square Historic District is part of the larger Hilltop Neighborhood. In 2010 community planners held workshops and other meetings to revitalize the area. They are focused on the commercial district on Harrison Street, which just to the west of the historic district, as well as infill housing in the residential sections. Trinity Episcopal Cathedral Trinity Episcopal Cathedral The cornerstone for the cathedral was laid in 1867 and it was completed in 1873, except for its bell tower and spire. The church was designed by New York City architect Edward Tuckerman Potter and was completed for $80,000. It was only the second Episcopal Church in the United States built exclusively as a cathedral. The attached parish house was completed in 1993, replacing an older building, and the bell tower and spire were completed in 1998 after Potter's original design. The cross on top of the spire reaches above the ground. On the south side of the cathedral is the dean's house. The buildings are harmonious in appearance, scale, and materials. They are all masonry buildings, grey-tan in color and follow the cathedral's Gothic Revival style. The cathedral complex had another building that was a contributing property in the historic district, but it has subsequently been torn down. Davenport architect John W. Ross designed the two-story, brick, Gothic Revival, Ely House (1881). Caroline D. Ely of New York paid for its construction, and its use was intended as the residence for the holder of a theological chair at Griswold College. The chair had been endowed by her late husband, David J. Ely, and the house was named in his memory. Central High School Central High School Davenport Central High School sits directly across Main Street from Trinity Cathedral. Its building's darker coloring create a contrast with those of the cathedral complex, which are lighter in color. The school at one time was a multi-building complex. The main building of the high school was completed in 1907. It was designed by Parke Burrows in the Beaux Arts style and was built in dark red brick. The building is a square plan with a stone basement and hipped roof. On both the Main Street and Harrison Street sides of the building are single round-arched entrances that are framed with Ionic columns. Several additions have been made to the building over the years. In front of the main school building sits the former Kemper Hall. It was designed by Edward S. Hammatt who also designed the buildings for Griswold College and St. Katherine's Hall, the Episcopal girls' school on the east side of Davenport. He utilized a Victorian Romanesque Revival style that was built in dark red brick and red-brown sandstone for the foundation and details. There is a round tower on the southeast corner of the building with a stylized cross on the top of the spire-shaped roof. Before World War I an industrial arts building was built on the campus. It was a side-gable brick building in the Colonial Revival style. The building was illuminated by large multi-paned steel windows that were similar to those used in factories of the era. It has subsequently been torn down. Civil War Monument Between the cathedral and the high school sits the Civil War Soldier's monument in the middle of Main Street. The monument is a stone obelisk topped by a statue of a soldier, which faces south towards the Mississippi River in the valley below. Battles in which local soldiers fought are engraved on each side of the obelisk in two rows. The battles listed are: Shilo, Donelson, Wilsons Creek, Fort Blakely, Corinth, Prairie Grove, and Vicksburg. It was built in 1880, and listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1993. Residential Neighborhood Parker-Ficke House The residential section of the district is a four-block area north of the high school and cathedral complexes. Most of the houses are fairly large in size and reflect various architectural styles. Some of the styles include Second Empire, Queen Anne, Greek Revival, American Craftsman, and Colonial Revival. The most dramatic residence is the Parker-Ficke House on Main Street, across Twelfth Street from Central High School. It is considered one of the finest examples of Second Empire construction in the state of Iowa. Built in 1881, the house features a mansard roof, multicolor slate shingles, wrought-iron roof cresting, brackets, moldings, and fanciful window surrounds. Today the building serves as a fraternity house for Palmer College. It was listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 2003. The neighborhood at one time included the former St. Paul's English Lutheran Church. The Gothic Revival structure that was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places has since been torn down. In addition to the institutional buildings, several houses were also designed by local architects and builders. However, none of the commissions are considered their best work. They include T.W. McClelland (Parker-Ficke House and 133 West 13th Street), G.A. Hanssen (G.A. Koester House), and Edward S. Hammatt who designed a house for himself on West 13th Street.

Life  Papanikolis was born on the island of Psara in 1790. At an early age he joined his father, Georgios, in his trading travels, and participated in fights with the corsairs of the Barbary Coast. During the first months of the Greek War of Independence, the Greek naval vessels, mostly converted and armed merchantmen, were unable to confront the larger and better-armed Ottoman warships. The rebels therefore decided to use fireships. Papanikolis volunteered for the first attempt, which was carried out successfully on in the harbour of Eressos in Lesbos, where the fireship destroyed an Ottoman two-deck frigate which lay in anchor there. This led to the generalized use of fireships by the Greeks, who were thus able to even the balance with the far more powerful Ottoman Navy. Papanikolis remained active for the remainder of the war, distinguishing himself again in the Battle of Gerontas in August 1824. In 1829, after the war's end, he purchased a 1/3 share in the brig Nelson, and pursued trade with it until 1833, when the ship was purchased and commissioned into the Royal Hellenic Navy, with Papanikolis as captain. In 1836 however the ship sank after ramming a reef off Zakynthos, and Papanikolis was placed in suspended service until 1841, when he was given command of the corvette Amalia. In 1843, after the 3 September 1843 Revolution, he was elected as a representative of Psara for the constituent assembly. In 1846, he was placed as chairman of the naval court, retaining the post until his death in 1855.  Honours  In addition to several roads throughout Greece, three submarines of the Hellenic Navy have been named after him.

The story, written almost entirely as dialogue, describes a tense scene between a newly married couple traveling by train to New York City for the first night of their honeymoon. Synopsis An unnamed young couple are traveling in a train car. The dialogue reveals that they have been married for \\"two hours and twenty-six minutes.\\" During the scene, they discuss the wedding, the bridesmaids' dresses, the bride's new hat, what to do at their destination, and other apparently trivial topics. They briefly fall into a petty argument about whether their marriage was a good decision. By the end, they make up and pledge to avoid fighting during the marriage. However, none of what is said is the actual topic of conversation. The two characters are actually attempting to talk about sex—specifically, the fact that they are expected to consummate the marriage that night. It is implied that they have never previously discussed this or, indeed, experienced any degree of physical intimacy. Neither is willing to explicitly broach the topic; rather, each appears to be hoping that the other is making the same assumptions about what is to take place. The petty conflicts that erupt during the conversation represent each character's fear that their new spouse in fact does not have the same assumptions about what is expected of them, and by extension, that the new partner does not love them in the way they want to be loved. The wife in particular is concerned about her powerlessness in the marital arrangement, mentioning several times the fact that she is \\"alone\\" on a train with the husband, away from her family. Although the characters appear to have come to an unspoken consensus by the end, the author makes heavy use of irony to imply that this is only the first of many failures to communicate. Anthologies and adaptations \\"Here We Are\\" has been anthologized in a number of Parker short story collections, including After Such PleasuresAfter Such Pleasures at Goodreads and The Portable Dorothy Parker.The Portable Dorothy Parker at Goodreads It has also been adapted into a one-act play.

He took an active part on the Revolution of the Park and was one of the first to enter the Artillery Park, along with Leandro Alem, being arrested and exiled to Uruguay.

He wrote works on the life of Juan Manuel de Rosas and the Argentine Confederation, which earned him intellectual prestige and good sales income, and the favor of being considered as part of the Buenos Aires intellectual elite. In 1881 he published the first version of what in 1888 would be his master work, the Historia de la Confederación Argentina. With ingenuity, he dedicated it to Mitre and sent it to him for consideration. Mitre responded harshly, condemning the work, his conclusions and the author.

Description Le Défenseur du Temps is a clock made of automata. Close to the dial, a man perched on a rock with a sword and shield fights against a bird, a dragon, and a crab which respectively represent air, earth, and water. As originally designed, every hour from 9 am to 10 pm, he fights one of the three animals chosen randomly by a program. At noon, 6 pm, and 10pm, all three animals attack at the same time. The time is announced by three strokes. While the man fights, he is accompanied by sounds of breaking waves, rumbling earth or the sound of wind, depending on the animal chosen. Le Défenseur du temps is 4 meters high and weighs about 1 ton. The characters, animals and the clock face are hammered brass and gold leaf. The rock on which they sit is composed of oxidized brass. In its original configuration, a master electronic quartz circuit board controlled the random attacks chance, and used six cam timers and five tape recorders. Location Le Défenseur du temps is located at 8 rue Bernard de Clairvaux, in the Quartier de l'Horloge in Paris' 3rd arrondissement. The area around the clock owes its name to this work. History Le Défenseur du temps was commissioned in 1975 by COGEDIM. The scales of the dragon were made by Louis Desouches, and the construction of the steel structure was by Alain Moirod. The clock was partially installed in September 1979. It was formally dedicated on 8 October 1979 by the Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac. The clock underwent restoration in 1995. The master clock's quartz crystal was replaced by a radio clock, and the tape recorders were replaced by a compact disc player. Without funding for maintenance, the clock has been stopped since July 1, 2003.

Having played for the second team since 1952 in the Minor Counties, he made a sensational first-class debut for Surrey at the age of 26 in 1955, taking five Worcestershire wickets for 23 runs in the first innings of the match at The Oval and following that up with five for 50 in the second innings for match figures of 10–73. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he \\"made fast-medium deliveries lift on drying turf\\". He never surpassed either the first innings figures or the match figures. But in the strong Surrey side of the 1950s, Kelleher was unable to retain his place and at the end of the 1955 season he left the county and joined Northamptonshire under special registration. He immediately went into the Northamptonshire first team and retained his place across the damp summer of 1956, often opening the bowling with the England fast bowler Frank Tyson. Wisden noted that he \\"did well in a year when pitches were not in the main suited to his medium-fast bowling\\". In all matches, he took 55 wickets at an average of 28.38. As with his Surrey career, his best day was his first one: in the opening match of the season against Nottinghamshire he took five wickets for 85 (and Tyson took four for 59) in Nottinghsmahire's first innings, and these would be the best innings figures of his Northamptonshire career. The 1957 season, when Northamptonshire finished as runners-up to Surrey in the County Championship, was the most successful in the county's history, but most of the bowling success was down to Tyson, who took 100 wickets in a season for the first time, and the three slow bowlers, George Tribe, Jack Manning and Michael Allen, who took 305 Championship wickets between them. Kelleher took just 44 wickets in 22 matches and his bowling average, 26.90, contrasted with the county's other bowlers, all of whom averaged less than 20 runs per wicket. In 1958, he played in three early matches, but took only one wicket, and lost his place in the attack to Albert Lightfoot, who supplemented his occasional bowling with useful batting, a skill Kelleher never aspired to. He left Northamptonshire at the end of the 1958 season.

Situated on the western edge of the Southern Heath Nature Park in the Lüneburg Heath, about 1 km southwest of Hermannsburg itself, it currently has about 610 inhabitants. The name means \\"village on the Beke\\" (i.e. the stream). In old records it can be found as Beketorpe, Bekendorpe or Beckedorp. In 1973 Beckedorf was incorporated into the parish of Hermannsburg as part of Lower Saxony's territorial and administrative reforms.  Pre-history  In 1936 Dr. Hans Piesker, an archaeologist from Hermannsburg, discovered a settlement of the Beaker culture (ca. 4200-2800 BC) northwest of Beckedorf on the Lührsberg, a low hill 77 metres above sea level and 500 metres wide. Of the original settlement, 30,000 square metres in area, numerous post- and settlement pits were exposed, as well as several house structures. The houses had a length of about 6 metres and were dug between 0.80 m and 1.40 m into the ground. They had braided walls (Flechtwände) coated in clay. In addition, arrowheads, scrapers, a spearhead and fragments of axes made of flint were found and shards of pottery excavated. From the discovery of spindle whorls it can be deduced that also wool or plant fibres were also been processed here. The other partially surviving barrows in the area, the barrows at Wohlde, the burial site at Bonstorf and the megalithic grave at Dohnsen from the Neolithic age, indicate that there was a settlement here before and during the Bronze Age.  History  The first written mention of Beckedorf dates to the year 1235 in a document which is now in the archives of Walsrode Abbey. Here it mentions that Count Siegfried of Osterburg gave the monastery a few houses that had previously been enfeoffed to the knight, Dietrich of Beckedorpe, who had since died.  Economy and Transport  The place was dominated by the railway. The Celle- Soltau railway run by the East Hanoverian Railways runs through the village and branches here; the line to Munster branches off in Beckedorf (see also Celle-Soltau, Celle-Munster Light Railway). Passenger services were reduced in 1970 and cut entirely in 1976; freight services have reduced considerably. The line to Munster is used primarily for military traffic to Munster Training Area and the line to Soltau for transport to the Bergen-Hohne Training Area. Today there are several farms in Beckedorf. Some of them even have Treppenspeicher storage barns from the 19th century. A Häuslingshaus has been partly preserved in its original state. Häuslinge were farm workers who worked on the farm and, for a small rent, or even rent-free, were allowed to live in the house. Through the town flows a small stream, the Hasselbach, which flows into the Örtze.

Background Maqsud Shah was the Khan of Kumul from 1882 to 1930, and served as the eleventh generational ruler of the Khanate. Maqsud's family was descended from Chaghatai Khan and had ruled the area since the time of the Yuan dynasty, though by the 20th century all the other Khanates in Turkestan had disintegrated. Maqsud spoke Turkic in a Chinese accent and often wore Chinese clothing, and also spoke fluent Chinese. He reputedly drank copious amounts of alcohol and did not allow anyone to take pictures of him. Reign Maqsud Shah succeeded his father Muhammmad Shah in 1882 as ruler of the Kumul Khanate. The Khans were officially vassals of the Qing Dynasty, and every six years were required to visit Beijing to be a servant to the Emperor for a period of 40 days. Unlike the rest of Xinjiang which was subjected to state- encouraged settlement, the Kumul Khanate was not opened to settlement by Han Chinese. He sent melons as tribute to the Emperor. Twenty one Begs administered Kumul under the Khan, and he received 1,200 taels in silver from the Xinjiang government after he sent tribute. In 1912, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution and replaced by the Republic of China, which promptly appointed Yang Zengxin as the new Governor of Xinjiang. Yang was a monarchist and supported the Khanate and as a result the Khanate's status as a vassal was undisturbed. When Yang Zengxin was assassinated in 1928, the warlord governor Jin Shuren succeeded him as the governor of Xinjiang, who's period of rule was marked by strife, corruption and ethnic intolerance. Upon Maqsud Shah's death in 1930 Governor Jin Shuren replaced the Khanate with the three provincial administrative districts of Hami, Yihe, and Yiwu. Maqsud Shah's son and designated heir Nasir was not permitted to succeed him to the throne, and the succeeding events set off the Kumul Rebellion with the assistance of Yulbars Khan, who served as Maqsud's chancellor at court.

It began in June 2008. The curriculum includes aerial skills, such as static trapeze, corde lisse or rope, lyra) and juggling, unicycling, tightwire, tumbling, Chinese acrobatics, physical conditioning and other circus arts. Class sessions run four times per year, for eight weeks per session. Classes are for all ages, ranging from children 18 months and older, to adults of any age. In addition to ongoing classes, PSCA offers introductory workshops that are around one hour in length. They introduce potential students to aerials, circus arts, or children's circus arts. These special workshops require no prior experience in circus arts or formal training. The workshops also provide a forum for participants to try out aerials, circus arts and children's circus arts without the commitment of an eight-week session. PSCA has expanded from a school where one can learn circus arts to a performing arts organization that offers performances on-site and in the community. PSCA is a regular participant in the Philadelphia International Children's Festival, Philadelphia Folk Festival, the Chestnut Hill Fall for Arts festival, and other community celebrations. The school presents an annual fall cabaret performance every November. PSCA is also participating in the Kimmel Center for the Arts \\"Philadelphia International Festival of the Arts\\" in spring, 2011. The school is also the home to several performances that are part of the Philadelphia Live Arts/Fringe Festival. In 2009, Philadelphia School of Circus Arts attracted 1,500 patrons to performances and events. Summer camp Every summer, PSCA presents summer camp for children of all ages. The Youth Camp gives children the opportunity to develop skills on the trapeze, aerial rope and silks, juggling, unicycling, plate-spinning, diabolo, devil sticks, tightwire, rolling globe, rola-bola, clowning and tumbling. The Youth Camp also includes activities such as dance and performance classes, student showtimes, lunchtimes in the park, co-operative games. Children must be seven years old and have completed the first grade to attend youth camp. Kindercamp is for children five to six years old. This one-week program places a greater emphasis on play and exploration. Children will learn how to do trapeze, aerial rope and silks, feather-balancing, scarf-juggling, plate- spinning, tightwire, rolling globe, tumbling and obstacle courses. The camp also includes playground visits, arts and crafts projects, as well as rest time. Additional activities at the PSCA studio include children's birthday parties, wedding and social events, private lessons, corporate team-building workshops, guest workshops, and school vacation activities. Coaches The Head coach currently at PSCA is Adam Woolley. He is on the Board of Directors of American Youth Circus Organization and works as Safety Program Manager for the American Circus Educators Association. In addition, he is a sought-after corde and silks instructor. Terry Brennan works as a Parkour instructor and Youth Circus Instructor. He is also head of the PSCA \\"Youth Troupe\\". Aerial instructors include: Adam, Rachel Lancaster, Christine Morano, Shannon Sexton, Megan Gendall, Fenix Cobbledick, Karen Ladd, Molly Wright, and Eric Micheals. Many instructors specialize in acrobatics, handstands, or juggling, like Nicole Burgio and Richard Kennisson. All of the coaches have professional education in circus and/or a long history in its practice. Performances PSCA puts on several shows and performances annually, both in and out of the school itself. They have Student showcases twice a year for adult students and once for younger students in a \\"Youth Soirée\\". in addition to these, many of the staff member at the school participate in gigs and traveling performances throughout the year. The smaller youth group called PSCA's \\"Youth Troop\\" coordinates many shows throughout the greater Philadelphia area. Some students may also coordinate shows with other schools, like the Pennsylvania Academy of Ballet. History PSCA was founded by Shana Kennedy, who is the owner of PSCA along with her husband, Greg Kennedy. Greg is an internationally renowned juggler, who was in Cirque du Soliel's Totem from 2010-2014. Kennedy trained as an aerialist and a juggler at Circomedia, in England. She began teaching aerial skills in her home's backyard in 2001. In 2006, Kennedy formed Air Play, which would become a performance and teaching company. In 2008, Kennedy opened the full-fledged school facility known today as Philadelphia School of Circus Arts. The school's Coordinating Director is Kitsie O'Niel. The school attracts students are all ages and all levels, coming from the local area (Germantown, Mt. Airy, Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, South Jersey) all the way to New York City. The studio space is located in a renovated bowling alley with picture windows that overlook neighboring gardens, an elevated observation deck, rigging points for 18 pieces of aerial equipment and an expanse of bamboo flooring. PSCA is an affiliate member of the Theatre Alliance of Greater Philadelphia. In 2010, PSCA was named \\"Best Children's Entertainment Winner\\" by the voters and readers of MyPHL17 Hotlist/Cityvoter for children's entertainment. In 2009, PSCA was named \\"Best of Philadelphia\\" by Philadelphia Magazine for children's classes.

It did not race successfully in the US but one won the premier cross-country competition in the UK in 1964. It still flies today. Design and development The Cosmic Wind was designed and built by Lockheed's chief test pilot, Tony LeVier, and a group of Lockheed engineers. A very small single- seat racer, it was aimed at the Goodyear Trophy for Formula 1 class racers initiated in the US soon after World War II. It is an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane. Wings and tail surfaces are all straight-edged and tapered. The ailerons are full span and carry trim tabs, as does the full-fin- depth rudder. The undercarriage is fixed, with streamlined main legs and wheels in long fairings. The roller tailwheel is tucked into the rear corner of the fuselage behind the rudder. The cockpit is enclosed with a small, single-piece, perspex canopy. The first aircraft were powered by 85 hp (63 kW) Continental C-85 horizontally opposed engines but more recently at least four have used the 100 hp (75 kW) Continental O-200-A. The engine installation includes a large pointed spinner and long, bulbous cylinder head/exhaust fairings. Operational history Cosmic Wind on display Three Cosmic Winds were built at Lockheed's between 1947 and 1948 and a fourth rather later. A fifth was also built in the US by amateur constructors. The last example was built in the UK as late as 1972. The type was not particularly successful in competitions in the 1940s, coming only 3rd and 4th in the 1947 Goodyear Trophy races. One example of the first three, named Ballerina and exported to the UK as G-ARUL, won the King's Cup Race of 1964; it remains active in the UK, and is a regular participant in air displays. The UK-built Cosmic Wind remains on the civil aircraft register as G-BAER, but currently (2010-10) lacks a Permit to Fly. In the US, the amateur-built example is now in the EAA AirVenture Museum, Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Another Cosmic Wind, built or modified with a shoulder rather than low wing, is in the Planes of Fame museum, Chino.

I see, now, when I go to the wedding), 162', in Weimar for the 20th Sunday after Trinity and first performed it in 1715 or 1716.  History and words  On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the ' (palace church), on a monthly schedule. He wrote the cantata for the 20th Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Ephesians, \\"walk circumspectly, ... filled with the Spirit\\" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the parable of the great banquet (). The cantata text was provided by the court poet Salomon Franck, published in ' (1715). He refers to the gospel and reflects how essential it is to follow the loving invitation of the Lord. Franck's language is rich in contrasts, such as ' (poison for the soul and bread of heaven), and of images derived from the Bible, such as \\"\\" (Heaven is his throne) after Isaiah 66:1. The closing chorale is the seventh stanza of Johann Rosenmüller's hymn \\"\\" (1652). Bach first performed the cantata on 3 November 1715 (according to the musicologist Alfred Dürr) or on 25 October 1716. Bach performed the cantata again on 10 October 1723 in his first year in Leipzig in a revised version, including a corno da tirarsi, a baroque wind instrument mentioned only in Bach's music and thought to have been similar to the slide trumpet (tromba da tirarsi). Bach's score is lost, and some parts seem to be missing as well.  Scoring and structure  Bach structured the work in six movements. Like other cantatas written during this period in Weimar, it is scored for a small ensemble, four soloists, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of corno da tirarsi (likely added in Leipzig), two violins, viola, and basso continuo, including bassoon in movement 1. Only the chorale is set for four voices. # Aria (bass): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (soprano): # Recitative (alto): # Duet aria (alto, tenor): # Chorale:  Music  The cantata opens with a bass aria in A minor, accompanied by three instruments in a polyphonic setting, the two violins and the viola (with the corno). The motif for the first words is present most of the time. The soprano aria seems to lack a part for an obbligato instrument. For the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage of the Monteverdi Choir (and John Eliot Gardiner), Robert Levin reconstructed a version for flauto traverso and oboe d'amore. The duet is also accompanied only by the continuo, but seems complete. The melody of the closing chorale is rare elsewhere, but appeared in Weimar not only in this work, but also in a chorale prelude of Johann Gottfried Walther.

Their band name comes from the Japanese expression バックシャン (bakkushan, a woman that looks better from behind than from the front). The band was formed in June 2007 by Daniel Schmidt, Christian Kalle, Robert Kerner and Jan Siekmann. In 2008, the band signed to EMI Virgin Records and during that year they won the Jägermeister Rock: Liga Video Contest and Beck’s On Stage Festival Challenge. In 2010, they represented the state of Baden-Württemberg, in the Bundesvision Song Contest. They finished in 9th place with 39 points.  History  Bakkushan was formed by singer Schmidt together with Kalle, Kerner and Siekmann in July 2007 during their studies at the Popakademie Mannheim. Their first live performance was at the Academy on 28 July 2007. Schmidt developed the band's first EP at home on the computer, to be used as a demo. On the EP were the songs Baby du siehst gut aus, Lass die Sonne und mich allein and the song after which the EP was named, Springwut. The EP was released later in 2007 after the surprise success of the song Springwut. The accompanying music video was made without outside investors. The first tour with almost 40 concerts was planned and completed successfully in 2008. After winning the Jägermeister Rock:Liga video contest, the band had the opportunity to film a professional music video for the song Springwut. The band also performed at Hurricane Festival 2008 after winning the Beck's On Stage Festival Challenge. After one concert, Bakkushan were offered a contract by a manager from the record label EMI. However they declined, wishing to further hone their sound, contacting the manager six months later to sign to the record label. Under contract from EMI, Bakkushan began to work on their debut album in Cologne. Daniel Schmidt was joined in production by Moritz Enders, who had previously worked with Donots, Revolverheld, Livingston and Blackmail. The band toured Germany, Austria and Switzerland in early 2009. Their first single, Baby du siehst gut aus was released on 12 July 2009. The single was featured in the film Vortstadtkrokodil 2. Bakkushan's eponymous debut album, Bakkushan was scheduled to be released on 11 September 2009 but was instead released on 26 March 2010. Two weeks prior, the single Alles war aus Gold had been released. On 16 April 2010, Bakkushan appeared on MTV Home. On the same day they reached number 96 in the German album chart, ahead of releases by Jennifer Rostock and . Bakkushan toured again in Germany and Austria throughout the Spring and Summer of 2010. On 23 July 2010, Bakkushan released their third single Lass die Sonne und mich allein. Bakkushan represented Baden-Württemberg on 1 October 2010 at the Bundesvision Song Contest, playing their fourth single, Springwut, released on 27 September 2010. They reached ninth place with 39 points. The band announced that they were close to finishing their second album in March 2012 alongside the release of a new single, Böse Mädchen feiern besser. This was followed on 29 June 2012, by Nur die Nacht. Two weeks later, on 13 July 2012, the band's sophomore album, Kopf im Sturm was released. The band released another single, Der letzte Mensch der Welt on 26 October 2012, before beginning their Kopf im Sturm tour throughout Germany.

The film aimed to warn children of the dangers of careless or foolhardy behaviour in the vicinity of water, and was shown regularly on TV for several years during breaks in children's programming. Lonely Water is widely recalled as one of the most memorable and chilling of PIFs. In a poll carried out by the BBC on the 60th anniversary of the COI in 2006, Lonely Water was chosen as the UK's fourth-favourite PIF of all time and the highest ranked one-off production.\\"And the winner is...\\" BBC News Magazine, 28-03-2006.

Retrieved 04-10-2010 Background Lonely Water was directed by Jeff Grant and written and produced by Christine Hermon for Illustra Films, having been commissioned by the COI as a result of official concern over the high number of child fatalities in drowning accidents in the UK. Other PIFs of the early 1970s to tackle the subject of water safety included an instalment of the Charley Says series and Learn to Swim featuring Rolf Harris, which were targeted at younger children and parents respectively. Lonely Water however was aimed squarely at the 7-12 age group and was altogether darker in tone, featuring an eerie faceless black-robed and cowled figure and a voiceover by Donald Pleasence, whose echoing final words \\"I'll be back... back... back...\\" are often said semi-jokingly to have terrified an entire generation of British schoolchildren. Writing for the British Film Institute, Katy McGahan says Lonely Water is \\"eerily redolent of Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now\\" and \\"plays like a distilled horror film, deploying the menacing tone and special effects normally the preserve of X-rated cinema shockers.\\"Lonely Water (1973), McGahen, Katy. BFI Screen Online. Retrieved 04-10-2010 Synopsis The camera pans across a mist-shrouded expanse of water clogged with fallen trees and branches, with a ghostly black-clad figure hovering hazily on the water's surface. \\"I am the spirit of dark and lonely water: ready to trap the unwary, the showoff, the fool...\\" intones the voiceover, \\"...and this is the kind of place you'd expect to find me. But no-one expects to find me here. It seems too ordinary\\", as the scene switches to a group of children playing on the muddy edge of a murky pool. A boy is teetering on the steep, slippery bank attempting to retrieve a football from the pool with a stick. \\"But that pool is deep. The boy is showing off...the bank is slippery,\\" says the spirit, approaching from behind as the child slips into the water. \\"The unwary ones are easier still,\\" observes the spirit, as a boy is seen fishing in a duckpond, leaning out over the water as he holds onto a tree branch. \\"This branch is weak, rotten; it'll never take his weight.\\" The branch gives way and the boy tumbles into the pond as the spirit appears among the reeds. A \\"Danger - No Swimming\\" sign appears on screen. \\"Only a fool would ignore this, but there's one born every minute.\\" The lakeside is littered with rusting junk, and the bed of the lake is also strewn with hidden traps. A boy has gone swimming and got into trouble, waving his arms and floundering. \\"It's the perfect place for an accident.\\" The struggling boy is spotted by a group of children who find a big stick with which to help him out of the water. \\"Sensible children!\\" says the spirit in exasperation as his robes collapse into a heap on the ground, \\"I have no power over them!\\" The boy is rescued, shivering. A girl is told to \\"go over and get that thing to wrap him in\\". She picks up the robes, but throws them into the water in disgust (the girl's line, which baffled many viewers, is \\"Urgh...'orrible fing!\\" spoken in a strong London accent). As the robes sink under the water, the spirit voices his famous echoing threat: \\"I'll be back!\\" Production The script for Lonely Water was written by Christine Hermon for the COI and passed to Jeff Grant for direction. Grant recalled the moment he received the script, \\"I read it and got a bit of a shock. Gone was the gentle cajoling of Rolf Harris, who had recently appeared in a public information film aimed at persuading children to learn to swim. This one plumbed the darkness; it set out to scare.\\"\\"Dark and Lonely Water\\"Besonian, Jeff Grant's journal Retrieved 25-05-2011 It was posited that the COI were being \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"foolhardy\\" with such a frightening script, though Grant praised the creative latitude it gave him as director, \\"something you more often than not had to fight for\\". Lonely Water was filmed over two days a few miles north of London. Initial difficulties with the filming included getting the smoke to drift in the right direction, constructing a wooden platform for the spirit to stand on, and the noise of aircraft flying overhead due to the shooting location being close to Heathrow Airport. Planes can be heard in the tracking shot of the rusted cars and cookers, which were brought in specially for the filming. Reception Many of its viewers took notice of its message by not swimming in dangerous waters for safety's sake, or because the film had scared them so much that they never wanted to go swimming again.BBC News Magazine, comments Retrieved 04-10-2010.

In 1896, she was purchased by Adrien de Gerlache for conversion to a research ship, taking part in the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897–1901, becoming the first ship to overwinter in the Antarctic. In 1902, she was sold to Philippe, Duke of Orléans and used on expeditions to the Arctic in 1905 and from 1907–09. In 1916, she was sold and converted to a passenger and cargo ship, serving Spitsbergen from the Norwegian mainland under the name Isfjord. In 1918, she was sold and renamed Belgica, being converted to a factory ship. Requisitioned by the British in April 1940, she was used as a depôt ship, being scuttled when the Franco-British Expeditionary Force evacuated Harstad in northern Norway. In 2007, plans to build a modern replica of Belgica were announced.  Description  The ship was long, with a beam of and a draught of . She was rigged as a barque. As well as sails, the ship was propelled by a steam engine built by Nylands Verksted, Oslo. The engine drove a screw propellor that was arranged so that could be raised out of the water if necessary.  History  = Early history = Patria was built by Christian Brinch Jørgensen at Svelvik, Norway, as a whaler. The ship was constructed of Pine, American Pine and Oak ribs, with thick Greenheart planks clad in oak and sheeted in Iron. The ship had a strengthened bow to enable her to operate in ice. Her designer and owner was Johan Christian Jakobsen. = Antarctic expedition = Belgica in Antarctic waters In 1896, Patria was bought by Adrien de Gerlache for conversion to a research ship. On 4 July 1896, she was renamed Belgica. A 21-gun salute was fired during the renaming ceremony. De Gerlache raised funds for the expedition from the Société Royale Belge de Géographie. Loaded with 40 tons of food in 10,000 tins, on 16 August 1897, Belgica departed Antwerp, Belgium for the Antarctic, with a crew of 23. Led by de Gerlache, the expedition included Georges Lecointe as captain of Belgica. Other members of the expedition included Roald Amundsen, Henryk Arctowski, Antoni Dobrowolski and Emil Racoviţă. The overloaded Belgica broke down in the North Sea and was forced to put into Ostend for repairs. Two crewmen deserted there and two more crewmen went ashore without permission, returning to Belgica drunk. At one point, Belgica almost rammed the Belgian Royal Yacht. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil was reached on 6 October 1897. Frederick Cook joined the ship there. On reaching Montevideo, Uruguay, the cook was sacked and a Swedish replacement was hired. On the voyage between Montevideo and Punta Arenas, Chile, the engineer allowed the boiler to run dry. He was dismissed when the ship reached Punta Arenas, which was on 1 December 1897. Further disciplinary problems at Punta Arenas resulting in the Chilean Navy being asked to intervene. The Swedish cook and three Belgian sailors were dismissed, and Belgica departed for the Antarctic somewhat undermanned. Sailor Carl Wiencke was lost overboard en route to Antarctica, Wiencke Island being named in his honour. Belgica crossed the Antarctic Circle on 15 February 1898. On 3 March, Belgica became wedged in the pack ice. The crew had not prepared for overwintering in Antarctica well. De Gerlache forbade the crew to eat the penguin and seal meat that had been stockpiled because he hated eating it. As a result, scurvy became a problem on board Belgica. Following the death of magnetician Emile Danco on 5 June 1898, the situation worsened. Morale worsened after the death of Nansen, the ship's cat, on 22 June. By 22 July, command of the ship was taken by Amundsen and Cook, as de Gerlache and Lecointe were too ill. Cook insisted that the men ate the penguin and seal meat, following which the crew rapidly recovered from the scurvy. The prospect of a second winter in Antarctica spurred the crew on in their efforts to free Belgica. On 14 February 1899, Belgica was finally freed from the ice, although it was another month before she was able to set sail for Punta Arenas, where she arrived on 28 March. Belgica was repaired in Punta Arenas, then sailed for Buenos Aires, Argentina. Leaving Buenos Aires on 14 August 1899, she sailed for home, arriving at Boulogne-sur-Mer on 30 October and Antwerp on 5 November, sparking national celebrations in Belgium. Following her return to Belgium in 1901, Belgica was again used for whaling. = Arctic expeditions = Belgica, painting (2012) by the Belgian painter Yasmina In 1902, Belgica was sold to N C Halvorsen, and then later that year to Philippe, Duke of Orléans. In 1905, she was used in an expedition to chart the north east coast of Greenland, Svalbard and Franz Josef Land, de Gerlache again being involved. In 1907–09, Belgica was used in an expedition to the Arctic], again headed by Philippe and captained by de Gerlache. It was planned to map Arctic Russia, but these plans were abandoned when Belgica again became trapped in ice. = Later history = In 1916, Belgica was sold to the Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompagni, Spitsbergen and was renamed Isfjord. She was rebuilt to include cabins for female staff. Isfjord was used to carry coal and passengers between Svalbard and northern Norway. In 1918, Isfjord was sold to Kristian Holst, Harstad. She was stripped of her bowsprit, dismasted and converted to a factory ship, regaining her former name Belgica. From the late 1930s, Belgica was used as a coal hulk. In April 1940, Belgica was requisitioned by the Franco-British Expeditionary Force for use as a depôt ship storing high explosives. Belgica was scuttled when the Franco-British Expeditionary Force evacuated from Harstad. The Allied evacuation of Harstad took place on 7 and 8 June 1940, and several British ships were also scuttled in order to avoid having them fall into German hands. The wreck of Belgica was discovered at Easter, 1990. Belgicas anchor is an exhibit in the Polar Museum, Tromsø, Norway. The Sør-Troms Museum in Harstad plans to hold an exhibition of artefacts retrieved from Belgica.  Replica  In 2006, the VZW New Belgica was formed with the intention of constructing a replica of Belgica. The project was officially launched on 9 September 2007 at De Steenschuit's yard in Boom, Antwerp by Kris Peeters, Minister-President of the Belgian region of Flanders. Queen Paola is the project's patron. Construction is scheduled for completion in 2013. It is planned to raise the wreck of Belgica and to put it on display at the Belgian National Maritime Museum, Antwerp. Before the wreck is raised, the Royal Norwegian Navy will remove the remaining ammunition.

Excavations and surveys at the site have uncovered various finds and archaeological evidence. Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\". Description Pencil sketch of Battlesbury Camp, from The Ancient History of Wiltshire by Sir Richard Colt Hoare, 1810 Battlesbury occupies the summit of an irregular point of down, with its defences following the natural contours of the hill, and being by nature of the site almost inaccessible on the west and northeast sides. It has triple ditches and ramparts for the most part, with double on the southeast side. The site encloses 23.5 acres in all. There are entrances at the northwest and northwest corners.\\"Battlesbury Camp,\\" The Modern Antiquarian website. Accessed 12/14/10. Pits found within the fortifications contained late Iron Age pottery, the hub of a chariot wheel, an iron carpenter's saw, a latch-lifter for a hut door, querns, whetstones, sling stones, and animal bones. These all indicate a permanent occupation and date from the 1st century BC. Unfortunately it is suspected that the hills inhabitants came to a violent end, due to the many graves containing men, women and children outside of the northwest entrance. It can only be guessed at whether Roman legions put people to the sword, or if this was the result of intertribal warfare sometime before the Roman conquest.\\"Battlesbury: Warminster, Wiltshire.\\" Roman Britain website. Accessed 12/14/10. The southwest area of the hill fort is apparently built over and around preceding Bronze Age burial mounds or tumuli. Part of the inner ditch is occupied by a large circular barrow, which was excavated, but was found empty. A few feet further to the west are two other barrows, over which the great inner rampart passes; these on opening, proved to be sepulchral: in the largest was found a cist containing burned human bones at the depth of two feet; and in the smallest, two skeletons were found, lying from south to north, the head of the smallest reclining on the breast of the other. On the breast of the largest skeleton there was a small ring or bead of stone, which was probably worn as an amulet.Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Chapter No. 4 – Station 2: Warminster, The Ancient History of Wiltshire, 1812. Later excavations and surveys adjacent to Battlesbury Camp hill fort in 1998 have also uncovered late Bronze Age to middle Iron Age settlement activity including for ditches, roundhouses, four-post structures and numerous pits. Some of the pits contained human burials, and other deposits of artefacts and animal bones which appear to have been formally placed.The megalithic portal website, 21 July 2002.

Released in 1987, it mixes live and studio recordings and marks the band's beginning a collaboration with British anarchist group Chumbawamba. Background In 1986 The Ex added former Rondos vocalist/cartoonist Johannes van der Weert as a back-up singer and booked a European tour with British group The Membranes. Gigs were recorded by The Ex's sound engineer Dolf Planteijdt and mixed with material recorded in the studio to comprise the songs for Roo Many Cowboys. In addition to material not available on any other Ex release, the album contains live versions of songs previously found on the band's double-single/book about the Spanish Civil War and from their then- forthcoming Peel Sessions compilation album, as well as a cover versions of songs by seminal communist Dutch punks The Rondos and contemporary British anarcho-punks Chumbawamba, with whom The Ex were beginning to collaborate. Release Too Many Cowboys came out as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve with all of its materials hand assembles and packaged by the band. The band chose to highlight the international do-it-yourself movement with a full spread 24-page newspaper stuffed with articles about music, counterculture, and politics from perspectives excluded by mainstream media. These included diverse stories about independent radio-stations, alternative media, small record labels, volunteer movements to build schools in El Salvadorian villages, the fight to end Apartheid, and the censorship trial against Jello Biafra and the Dead Kennedys. Van der Weert contributed artwork to additional poster inserts, the 36-page lyric book, and a stylized postcard from the band. A single-sided bonus flexodisc featured poet Nico Van Apeldoorn offering a spoken word report on events surrounding the recent death of a squatter held captive in a Dutch jail. Too Many Cowboys was the first of The Ex's records to be issued simultaneously in multiple countries and receive wider international distribution, seeing release on the band's own Ex Records in the Netherlands, by Ron Johnson Records in England, by Mordam Records in the United States, and by Di-Di Records in Greece. The Ex reissued Too Many Cowboys (minus one song and Van Apeldoorn's report) on a single CD in 1993 and launched it, along with the bulk of their back catalog, for streaming and download via Bandcamp.

When Luxembourg was invaded and annexed by Nazi Germany in 1940, a national consciousness started to come about. The LPL (Lëtzebuerger Patriote Liga) was founded in 4. September 1940 at the Lycée of Echternach in Echternach by Raymond Petit (born in 16. January 1920, killed himself on 21. April 1942 while he tried to escape from the Gestapo; he had no other choice except to use his last bullet to kill himself in order not to get captured by the Gestapo and getting tortured to get the names of members of other LPL- Members).:lb:Raymond Petit (Resistenzler)  History  The first rumors and flyers about the foundation of the LPL appeared in October 1940. Those flyers already appealed the inhabitants of Luxembourg to opposite against the German occupation. The LPL had one headquarter (“Quartier Général”), however not many people knew the names of those people – to avoid to get captured. Therefore, the country was divided in regional groups in different districts. The regional groups searched for members, the head of the regional group knew the head of the district, and finally the heads of the different districts knew the headquarter. Therefore, the members of the regional groups did not know the names of all the members, in order to avoid any leak of this highly critical information. There were no member lists. Gestapo tried over years to get names from members of the LPL however they therefore did never succeed. Actually the regional groups were at the beginning formed by students (school and high school(“Lycée”)), but those students grew the network by trying to find people with similar ideas, and they actually found many people, for example their parents, neighbors, members of different local associations and other people. In 1942, when the Gestapo did a raid through Luxembourg, there was no township left without at least 2 to 3 members of the LPL. At the beginning, the LPL secretly spread flyers and pictures, not only about resistance, but also news about the allied troops. In addition they tried to figure out how to support allied troops and to smuggle out people from Luxembourg so they could rejoin allied forces or resistance in France and Belgium too. They began to grow a network, not only in Luxembourg, but also with allied resistance movements in other countries. While their network grew, their activity grew too. They reproduced food ration cards and made/falsified ID-cards of any kind in order to help people in Luxembourg to survive. In October 1941 they even succeeded in getting weapons out of the police- department of Diekirch (occupied by the Germans). Nazi Germany wanted to add Luxembourg to German territory in 10. October 1941 (“Personenstandsaufnahme”), by making a referendum in Luxembourg. German occupants tried to force Luxembourgers by all means to vote for the annexation to Germany, however the LPL did massive campaigns against this \\"referendum\\", and the German had to accept that they did not get the result they hoped they would get. From that day on, Nazi Germany knew that the Luxembourgish inhabitants were completely opposite to Nazi propaganda, and that Luxembourg would never accept to be part of Germany. This failed referendum showed the mental strength of the Luxembourgish inhabitants. In addition the members of the LPL and other resistant movements got again the confirmation that Luxembourg would not surrender – and the members of the LPL went on expanding their activities.Raths, Aloyse 2008 - Unheilvolle Jahre für Luxemburg - Années néfastes pour le Grand-Duché p. 57 End of 1941 the LPL had a rather lose organizational structure, but at the beginning of 1942 the LPL informed the inhabitants of Luxembourg that a real “Governor” was now selected as head of the resistance, along with a few “Agents-Chefs”. The members of the LPL were aware of the fact that German occupants would get this information too, to confuse them. Raymond Petit was actually one of the \\"Agents-Chefs\\": AC13.Jean Aimé Stoll: “Portrait d'un résistant”, publizéiert am Buch “Dem Vergiëssen entrëissen” vum Roby Glesener After he had to kill himself, the German occupiers went on searching for this “Governor”, even though there was no real one. It was rather a group of people, and there never was a real head – even though Raymond Petit was one of the most famous people from the LPL- resistance.Erio: “Backgrounds”, “Luxemburger Wort”, 17. Januar 1947 Besides of the LPL-Petit there was another group, founded in northern Luxembourg by Alphonse Rodesch with the same name (LPL). This was by accident, even though both groups got naturally in contact during World War II. They however did never merge – both operated independently of each other.

Plot  A painter who has lived a stormy life that still rages on in his 70s; a lawyer who, forced to retire after a heart attack, spends his time feeding snails and searching for the quiet life; a doctor weary of his job and abandoned by his wife; a businesswoman who has fashioned loneliness into a lifestyle... These are the regulars of Ankara’s 25-year-old bar, Black & White, who gather here every evening. And then there is the bar’s manager Faruk, a stubborn, grumpy, touchy but extremely sweet man. One day, Faruk announces that he can no longer go on running the bar, and wants to shut it down. The regulars try their best to dissuade him.  Production  Ahmet Boyacıoğlu, who made his feature directorial debut, following his award-winning 2001 short The Funeral (), with this film, is according to Hürriyet Daily News reviewer Emrah Güler, a revered name for film enthusiasts in Turkey.

This is not a film where much happens except for long group dialogues, Yıldırım continues, and although the director, also portrays them in their personal, intimate and alone moments, these single character studies are somehow not enough to completely engage the audience. Yıldırım further contends that, the characters that are best drawn out in this film are not the men but women, and, both female performances are close to perfect. The film has very sweet moments of friendship, and its restrained camera work and editing ooze a certain serenity and composure; however, according to Yıldırım, one sometimes wishes that the makers of the film occasionally smashed this sterile world of modernity to pieces.

Their first, Sonya, was born in 1868 and died the same year. Lyubov never married. In later life she became estranged from her mother and moved out of their house. In 1913, after a trip abroad for medical treatment, Lyubov decided to stay there, and she lived abroad until her death in 1926. At that period she was also known by the name Aimée Dostoyevskaya (). She died in Italy of pernicious anemia. Although Lyubov Dostoevskaya was Orthodox, the funeral rite was Catholic by mistake. A simple wooden cross on her grave was soon replaced by a small porphyry tomb. In 1931 Italia Letteraria magazine suggested that since Dostoevskaya was buried in Italy, it was the Italian government that should establish a memorial. On December 1931 a granite pedestal was constructed, with an epitaph written by the editor of Venezia Tridentina magazine. Resting place of Fyodor Dostoevsky's daughter in Gries has been preserved after cemetery reconstruction. Her tomb was moved to Bolzano city's cemetery.  Works  Dostoyevsky as Portrayed by His Daughter, published in Russian by Gosudarstvennoe Izdatelstvo. Lyubov Dostoevskaya is best known for the book Dostoyevsky as Portrayed by His Daughter (, also known as Dostoyevsky According to His Daughter), originally published in Munich in 1920. Her memoirs, written in French and published in German, were later translated into other European languages. In 1920 the book was released in Dutch (in Arnhem), the following year there were translations into Swedish and English, and in 1922 it was published in the United States and Italy. A Russian version, highly abridged, was published in 1922 by Gosudarstvennoe Izdatelstvo (Saint Petersburg) under the title \\"Достоевский в изображении его дочери Л. Достоевской\\". The work contains many factual inaccuracies, partly because Lyubov was only 11 at the time of her father's death, and partly because she based the memoirs on her mother's stories.http://golosasibiri.narod.ru/downloads/kuz_ven_dost_1.pdflink= Many researchers tend to see this memoir as subjective and unreliable, citing as an example her bias in the description of the relationship between Dostoevsky and his first wife, Mariya Isayeva. Both Lyubov and her mother Anna expressed hatred towards Isayeva. Her other works include the short story collection Bolnye devushki (; 1911), and the novels Emigrantka (Эмигрантка; 1912) and Advokatka (Адвокатка; 1913).

He achieved wealth and fame by buying promising companies and reselling them to the public at inflated prices, but a prosecution exposed his deceitful practices. He was made bankrupt four times and served two prison terms. Hooley was the developer of the world's first industrial park, Trafford Park on the outskirts of Manchester. Early life Hooley was born in Sneinton, Nottinghamshire, the only child of Terah Hooley, a lacemaker, and his wife Elizabeth. He joined his father's lace business and in 1881 married baker's daughter Annie Maria, with whom he had four daughters and three sons. Possibly with the assistance of an inheritance from his mother, Hooley bought Risley Hall in Derbyshire for £5,000 in 1888, and in the following year set himself up as a stockbroker in Nottingham. Business career Hooley moved his business to London in 1896 and began to affect \\"a lavish lifestyle\\". The rise in his fortunes coincided with the boom in bicycles that year, and until the 1898 slump in that business he had promoted 26 manufacturers with a total nominal capital of £18.6 million; to impress investors he populated the boards of his companies with members of the aristocracy. One of his most profitable deals was the purchase of the Trafford Park estate from Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford in 1896. Hooley's original plan was to convert the park into a high-class residential area containing 500 grand villas, a racecourse, and an industrial fringe along the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal, but he was persuaded instead to develop the site as an industrial estate, the first in the world and still the largest in Europe. In 1895, he purchased Papworth Hall in Cambridgeshire. He was appointed High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for 1897. In 1896, he purchased the 2,000 acre Anmer Hall estate in Norfolk for £25,000, later reselling it to the Prince of Wales at cost. The Prince of Wales had attempted to purchase the property prior to Hooley buying it,Paul Hooley, \\"The secret crook who owned William and Kate's new home\\", Express, 18 November 2014 but it has been suggested his subsequent effort to secure it may have been to avoid the possibility of Hooley's business promoter Alexander Meyrick Broadley, whom he had earlier forced from Society, from becoming a constant guest and neighbour.La Marquise de Fontenoy (pseudonym of Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen), Chicago Tribune, 8 May 1916 http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1916/05/08/page/6/article/la-marquise-de- fontenoy In the later prosecution of Hooley, Broadley was denounced by Sir Robert Wright, Justice of the Court of the Queen's Bench, as the real author of Hooley's schemes. In 1897, Hooley was selected by the Conservative Party as their candidate to contest the parliamentary constituency of Ilkeston, Derbyshire at the next general election. His bankruptcy the following year made him ineligible to stand however. Hooley's bankruptcy was also a fraudulent affair. He did not, as has been much suggested, make over Risley and Papworth to his wife, but as his trustee in bankruptcy sold them to her instead.The Derby Mercury, 9 November 1898; issue 9592; p.2, column A Life on them went on very much as before – the press terming him 'The Splendid Bankrupt'. Hooley also continued his deceitful business activities, although on a smaller scale. He was made bankrupt again in 1911, 1921, and 1939, and jailed for fraud in 1912 and 1922.Robb, George White-Collar Crime in Modern England: Financial Fraud and Business Morality, 1845–1929, Cambridge University Press, 1992, pp. 105–107 Hooley estimated that during his career over £100,000,000 had passed through his hands, and he remained unrepentant: \\"my spirit remains uncrushed ... Conscious that if I had done a certain amount of harm to my fellow-beings, any rate I had also done a very considerable amount of good ... Seemingly all the English people on the Riviera lunched and dined my expense, and some of them even came to breakfast.\\"Hull Daily Mail, 27 February 1925 Despite his crimes, he also had admirers. The public prosecutor Sir Richard Muir, considered him the most attractive personality he encountered in his professional career, writing in his memoirs: \\"He might have made the greatest Chancellor of the Exchequer this country has ever known ... 'The Splendid Bankrupt' certainly had a wonderful way with him.Derby Daily Telegraph, Saturday 9 April 1927 However, Hooley's legacy was a string of ruined companies and firms floundering through overcapitalisation and shrunken share values, with the consequent losses for their investors.

He spent a month in Brixton Gaol for contempt of court and later in the same year received a twelve-month sentence for obtaining money on false pretences as part of a land deal. In the following year, he was judged bankrupt for the second time. He re-entered business as an estate agent, but by 1921 was again bankrupt, and in 1922 was convicted of fraud and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Following his release, Hooley returned to the business of property sales, continuing to work until his eighties. He was made bankrupt for a fourth time in 1939.

It was directed by Sergiu Nicolaescu. It was released on 24 August 1972 in Romania. Plot The story follows a young boy who is adopted by his uncle, Ioan, and his wife after his father, a partisan during World War II, is killed by soldiers. Ioan is the local village priest and though gentle and intelligent, is frustrated by his ward's apparent inability to love him. The boy, who equally ignores girls his own age, would far rather spend time with Todor, nicknamed Ipu, the so-called village idiot. Together they fish and reenact the French Revolution in the ruins of a neighboring village that was decimated for a minor infraction against the German occupying force. One day the boy watches a German cavalry officer conducting riding practice amid hay bales. Some time later the horse is seen galloping past without a rider and the boy finds the officer's corpse near the road. He reports the murder, but not before surreptitiously stealing the man's pistol. At the funeral, the local German commandant coldly informs the village that if the killer doesn't step forward by the next morning, the community's leaders (including Ioan and his wife, the mayor, the town doctor and the notary) will be executed. That night Ioan hosts a sumptuous feast. Todor, who is usually the target of nothing but derision and ridicule, is not only invited for the first time, but is made the guest of honor. The doctor gives him an impromptu, suspiciously cursory physical and informs him that his poor lifestyle is catching up with him. It soon becomes clear what is going on: the community leaders want Todor to lie and confess to the murder so that they can be saved. After some soul searching Todor gives in to their emotional supplications, but gradually realizes that for a brief window of time he holds a great degree of power and importance. He asks Ioan to perform a mock martyr's funeral so he can see what it will be like and, at the eleventh hour, demands money and land for the elderly, sick and crippled members of his family. But at dawn the German's make a surprise retreat from the village and all are saved. Todor falls to his knees in tears, though it is unclear whether he is relieved to escape death or bereft over his lost opportunity for heroism. Ioan and the other local intellectuals immediately revert to their previous superior attitudes. The boy, observing their hypocrisy, mentally sentences them all to death. He draws out the officer's pistol and a single shot is heard, though the film makes it ambiguous who, if anyone, is the victim.

Twelve-year-old Rigg was tortured, raped and murdered by her maternal uncle, John Maden. On 4 October 2010, 38-year-old Maden, who had pleaded guilty to the crime, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should never be released, meaning that he will likely remain in prison until he dies. Sentencing, Mr Justice Keith said: \\"This is one of those exceptional cases in which the only just punishment requires you to be imprisoned for the rest of your life.\\" Murder At 2:17pm on 3 April 2010, Maden, who had an \\"obsessive interest\\" in pornography relating to paedophilia, rape and torture, telephoned Rigg's mother and asked for Tia to go to his home in Dalmain Close, Cheetham Hill, in order to babysit his 12-year-old daughter. When she arrived at 3:00pm he drugged her with Olanzapine, an antipsychotic tranquilizer that he had been prescribed. He then inflicted a \\"horrific catalogue of sexual injuries\\" on her before stabbing her and strangling her with a ligature made from a guitar string. At 3:45pm, Maden telephoned the 999 emergency services number and said: \\"Hi, I would like to report a murder.\\" He then gave his name and address and when asked by the operator what had happened he replied: \\"My niece has been murdered by me ... I have just finished killing her now.\\" Asked why he had killed her he answered: \\"Because I felt like it\\" and terminated the call. Police officers from Greater Manchester Police arrived at the address two minutes later. Maden opened the door to the officers, who described him as \\"chillingly calm\\", and directed them upstairs. They found Rigg's body face-up on the floor of a spare bedroom, naked except for her socks, with the ligature still fastened around her neck and her hands tied behind her back with shoelaces. Next to the body were two knives, a broom handle and a sex toy, all of which were stained with blood. A post-mortem found that Rigg had suffered severe blood loss from her stab wounds and internal injuries, but the primary cause of death was ligature strangulation. Aftermath Maden was tried at Manchester Crown Court on 4 October 2010. Prosecutor Gordon Cole QC told the court: \\"In the year or so prior to April this year, the defendant had developed what can properly be described as an obsessive interest in images and literature relating to paedophilia, rape and torture. He had an extensive library of such materials which included literature dealing with methods of killing.\\" Police had found \\"hundreds of extreme images of child abuse and violent pornography\\" on Maden's laptop, plus more material on his mobile phone in folders named \\"snuff\\", \\"snuff stories\\" and \\"brutal rape\\". Detective Chief Inspector David Warren, who led the investigation, revealed that Maden refused to explain his actions and had never shown remorse for the killing. After pleading guilty to rape and murder, Maden was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should never be released. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Keith told him: \\"It is inescapable that Tia Rigg died because you decided to realise your fantasies about torturing and killing a young child. It is difficult to know how long Tia's ordeal lasted. The terror, the unimaginable pain you inflicted on her, the indignities you subjected her to while still alive. It was planned, it was premeditated and her agony must have been prolonged. This is one of those exceptional cases in which the only just punishment requires you to be imprisoned for the rest of your life.\\" A report issued regarding the case found problems with how social workers had handled Tia's care.

History According to Schürer, Thamna () – a city within the district of Diospolis (=Lydda) and which served once as a toparchy (administrative city) during the Roman period, is to be identified with the biblical city of Timnath-serah, but which is now the ruin Tibnah (Tibneh) in Samaria.Schürer, 1891, p. 158, note 438. In 1596, the Tibnah (Tibya) site was listed as village in the nahiya Quds, in the administrative district Liwā\` of Jerusalem, in a tax ledger of the \\"countries of Syria\\" (wilāyat aš-Šām) and which lands were then under Ottoman rule. During that year, Tibna was inhabited by 20 family heads, all Muslim, although the same village ceased to be inhabited in the late mandatory period. The Ottoman authority levied a 33.3% taxation on agricultural products produced by the villagers (primarily on wheat, barley, and olives), besides a marriage tax and supplement tax on goats and beehives. Total revenues accruing from the village of Tibna for that year amounted to 3700 akçe.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 114 Khirbet Tibnah is described in 19th century sources as a Tell overlooking a deep valley (Wady Reiya) on the north and the ancient Roman road to the south.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, p. 374 A cemetery was situated on a flat hill nearby, and to the northwest, the spring of Ein Tibnah emerged from a rocky channel. On the southwest was an oak tree some 30 or 40 feet high, and two wells, one of them dry. West of the tree were traces of ruins believed to be those of an Arab village. Charles William Wilson, who traveled through Palestine in 1866, reported a cemetery containing nine tombs south of the town, which was once capital of the surrounding district: One of these tombs was large, with a portico supported on piers of rock with very simple capitals. One of the piers was apparently destroyed between 1866 and 1873. There were niches for over 200 lamps at the tomb entrance. Inside was a chamber with fourteen graves, or kok'im, with a passage leading into an inner chamber containing one grave. He also wrote about a 40 foot high oak tree near the tomb, known as Sheikh et Teim, and a village about 3 miles to the east, called Kefr Ishu'a, or Joshua's Village.

It stars David Harbour, Molly Shannon, Rosemary DeWitt, and Mark Feuerstein. Career After graduating, cum laude, from Williams College, Leddy moved to New York City, where he started his career at MTV Networks as a writer for VH1. He quickly became a producer, and joined sister channel MTV where he rose to Senior Producer/Writer. After overseeing studio-based shows and VJ segments, Leddy developed and created series for the network. He created the in-depth artist profile series \\"MTV Rockumentary,\\" produced the pilot and first 7 episodes of \\"MTV Unplugged,\\" and wrote/directed/produced MTV's \\"Half Hour Comedy Hour.\\" After 7 years with MTV, Leddy went freelance and formed the production company BLIP Inc. (Bruce Leddy Independent Productions). He continued to work with MTV, producing, writing, and directing one-hour comedy specials financed by the movie studios as promotional vehicles for their films. Several of these starred Mike Myers including the \\"MTV Wayne's World\\" and \\"Wayne's World II Specials,\\" and \\"Austin Powers' Electric Pussycat Swinger's Club,\\" a show styled after the psychedelic '70's comedy series Laugh In, and Playboy After Dark. He also directed comedy specials for HBO, Showtime, and Comedy Central, as well as a muppet holiday movie for Fox broadcast and Sony Home Video called CinderElmo, starring Keri Russell, Oliver Platt, Kathy Najimy, and French Stewart. During production of an MTV special promoting the Mike Myers TriStar Pictures film \\"So I Married an Axe Murderer,\\" Leddy was offered the chance to direct his first feature film, a coming of age comedy called Bad With Numbers. Shot in Wilmington, North Carolina in 1994, the film starred Jason London, Tia Carrere, Jeffrey Tambor, Alexandra Lee, and Zak Orth. Two months before the film was to have a 1200 screen theatrical release, the distributing studio Savoy Pictures went bankrupt and the film was left in limbo. Eventually it was acquired by Trimark Pictures, and under the title My Teacher's Wife aired numerous times on the USA Network, and was released on DVD. Move to Los Angeles In 2000, Leddy moved to Los Angeles, and began a directing job at Fox's late night sketch comedy show MADtv. A two-week tryout ended up as a 9-season run, with Leddy becoming the primary director, logging over 200 episodes, and eventually becoming Co-Show Runner/Executive Producer along with head writer John Crane. Leddy continued to freelance on the MTV Movie Awards and MTV Video Music Awards. He wrote and directed the opening short film for the 1999 MTV Movie Awards, The Pitch (Titanic II), starring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and James Cameron. He also directed short films with Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans when they hosted the VMAs in 2000. In 2005, during hiatus from MADtv, Leddy directed and produced an independent film based on his original screenplay called Shut Up & Sing. The ensemble comedy/drama is about a group of guys who sang together in a college a cappella group who reunite 15 years later to sing at a friend's wedding. With the help of renowned casting director Avy Kaufman, Leddy assembled a stellar cast of New York-based performers including Mark Feuerstein, Molly Shannon, David Harbour, Rosemarie DeWitt, Elizabeth Reaser, and Reg Rogers. The film was shot on location in New York City and East Hampton, NY. On the festival circuit, the movie won 9 awards including the Audience Award at the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festivalhttps://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000665/2006/1/ in Aspen. Just prior to a limited theatrical release by Strand Releasing, the Weinstein Company announced they were naming their previously untitled Dixie Chicks documentary \\"Shut Up & Sing\\". A brief legal skirmish ensued and Leddy was forced to re- title his film, first as Sing Now or Forever Hold Your Peace, and then for international sales purposes, as The Wedding Weekend,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475390/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_21 and that title proved more popular with DVD distributors where it was picked up by First Look Studios and released in May 2008 on DVD. In May 2010, the film began airing on The Sundance Channel as The Wedding Weekend. It has been seen in multiple countries in Europe and had a theatrical release in Mexico in 2009.

It was built in 1926–27 and was designed by William M. Kendall of McKim, Mead & White in the Renaissance style, modeled after a 15th-century Roman palazzo. The building was restored, and the east facade completed, in 1996 by Buttrick White & Burtis with Italo Rota as associate architect.  History  In the 1920s, Italian student clubs il Circulo Italiano at Columbia and Barnard mobilized support for a Casa Italiana project. Columbia President Nicholas Murray Butler embraced the idea. The Casa campaign was led in New York by the students and by Judge John J. Freschi (who helped raise money). They reached out to New York developers Joseph Paterno, Anthony Campagna and Michael Paterno, who erected the building and covered all costs beyond contributions. The donation parchment delivered to Columbia University on Columbus Day 1927 stated that the university was to use the building as a cultural center: “as the centre and seat of Italian language, literature, history and art.” It further stated that the donation was given for “the diffusion of Italian culture in this country.” The building was utilized as a cultural and social center for Columbia students and the Italian American community at-large for 63 years. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini expressed enthusiasm for Casa Italiana as a center of Italian culture and civilization in the U.S. and donated some Renaissance furniture and portraits of himself and King Victor Emanuel. McKim, Mead & White, the firm responsible for the layout of Columbia's campus, created an impressive neo-Renaissance design for the Casa Italiana with limestone cladding all over, which set it apart from all other buildings on campus except for the imposing Low Library. Modeled on Roman palazzi of the Renaissance, the building opened in 1927. Dr. Charles Paterno generously gave 20,000 leather-bound books and funding for the Casa's original library. In 1991, the Italian Republic purchased the property for $17.5 million and leased it back to Columbia for 500 years. Renovations were undertaken, the Paterno Library was moved to the Butler Library and the Italian Department was relocated from the Casa Italiana to its current home in Hamilton Hall. and The Casa building became the seat of the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies, a restricted center for research in the humanities and sciences.[4] A new mission was proclaimed in its Charter: “to offer a privileged vision of Europe from an Italian perspective.” Overseeing the Italian Academy is a board of guarantors, half being appointed by the university and half by the Italian government.Newcomer, Eric P. \\"Italian-American Group Suing Columbia for Misuse of Building Development Gift\\" The New York Times (August 23, 2012) In 2012, a lawsuit filed by the Italic Institute, an advocacy group, in conjunction with the surviving Paterno Family, claimed that Columbia had breached its responsibilities in regard to the building's use. It claimed that the University violated the donative intent of 1927 by converting the building from a cultural center opened to the students of Columbia and the seat of the Department of Italian to a restricted research facility. The New York State Supreme Court dismissed the suit for “lack of standing\\" and did not rule on the substance of the complaint. . Casa Italiana is one of three buildings on the Columbia's campus that is designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, having achieved that status in 1978. It was also added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

It led to strong reprisals from the German occupiers, in the form of martial law, court-martial, mass arrests, two executions and several long-term jail sentences. Start The strike started among workers at the shipyard Akers mekaniske verksted and the industry site Christiania Spigerverk, as a spontaneous protest against the milk rationing announced on 8 September 1941. The workers lost their daily quota of milk, which had been given to them until then. The protests spread to other companies. On 9 September the number of strikers was estimated to 20-25,000, at around fifty industry sites. German reaction On 10 September the German Reichskommissar Josef Terboven declared martial law in Oslo and the neighboring municipality Aker. Two union leaders, Viggo Hansteen and Rolf Wickstrøm, were sentenced to death by a court-martial, and immediately executed by an SS Sonderkommando led by Oscar Hans. Later Ludvik Buland, Harry Vestli and Josef Larsson were also sentenced to death, but their convictions were changed to imprisonment for life in German jails. Both Buland and Vestli later died in German prisons. Albert Raaen was arrested. The mass arrests had direct consequences for the leadership of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions. Until then the Confederation had had a certain degree of independence with Buland as deputy chairman and Hansteen with a leading role. In May 1941 Håkon Meyer had proposed that in a reorganization of the Confederation, Hansteen would continue his job as legal consultant.Pryser, 1991: p. 26 After the milk strike the Confederation underwent \\"Nazification\\", with members of the Fascist party Nasjonal Samling installed as leaders. Erling Olsen became acting chairman on 10 September, and continued as deputy chairman when Odd Fossum was installed as chairman on 11 September. Kåre Rein was installed as secretary. I. B. Aase continued in his position as treasurer.Pryser, 1991: p. 32 New, comissarian leaders of the unions were installed as well. These were Birger Aamodt in the Union of Iron and Metalworkers, Thorvald Apeland in the Union of Food, Beverage and Allied Workers, Michael Berg in the Union of Employees in Commerce and Offices, Nils Bunæs in the Union of General Workers, Petter Holen in the Union of Railway Workers, Rolf H. Jahrmann in the Union of Forestry and Land Workers, Håkon Meyer in the Union of Municipal Employees, Trygve Rokling in the Transport Workers' Union, Aksel Schultz in the Norsk Murerforbund and Karsten Werner in the Norsk Centralforening for Boktrykkere. Borger Haugar led the Union of Clothing Workers. The comissarian leaders were hastily hired, so Haugar and Bunæs were removed after a short time and replaced with \\"more competent people\\". Furthermore, on 11 September, rector of the University of Oslo, Didrik Arup Seip, was dismissed from his position and arrested. Also other University staff, including the professors Anton Wilhelm Brøgger and Otto Lous Mohr, were arrested. On 12 September former Chief of Police in Oslo Kristian Welhaven, and the future Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen were arrested. Also journalists and newspaper editors, including Olaf Gjerløw and Fredrik Ramm, were arrested. In total around 300 people were arrested during the martial law period, which lasted until 16 September. A crackdown on certain parts of Norwegian society, especially left-wingers in the trade unions, was in some ways imminent after Operation Barbarossa. The incidents signalled a harder regime from the German occupiers. The executions of Hansteen and Wickstrøm became a lasting symbol for the Norwegian resistance.

Biography  Ives was born in New York City on Christmas Day, 1829. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1848 and received his M.A. in 1851. At Bowdoin, he was a member of the Athenaean Society.General Catalogue of Bowdoin College 1794-1950, page 92 He was a graduate of the United States Military Academy in 1852. As a Second lieutenant from 1853 to 1854 he was appointed by the U.S. Army to the Topographical Engineers as assistant to Lt. Amiel Weeks Whipple in the Pacific Railroad survey along the 35th parallel. From 1857 to 1858 Ives commanded an expedition to explore up the Colorado River from its mouth. He designed, built and tested his own stern-wheel steamboat, then shipped it to the Colorado River Delta. At Robinson's Landing he reassembled then used the 54-foot steamboat Explorer to map and survey the river. His party included Smithsonian associate John Strong Newberry as geologist and German artist Balduin Möllhausen. He led his party up the Colorado to a point just above the head of Black Canyon of the Colorado and beyond to the vicinity of Fortification Rock. Next day, they went two miles farther to Las Vegas Wash, which Ives thought might be the Virgin River, but had doubts because it seemed too small.Joseph C. Ives, REPORT UPON THE COLORADO RIVER OF THE WEST, EXPLORED IN 1857 AND 1858 BY LIEUTENANT JOSEPH C. IVES, CORPS OF TOPOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERS, UNDER THE DIRECTION OP THE OFFICE OF EXPLORATIONS AND SURVEYS, A. A. HUMPHREYS, CAPTAIN TOPOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERS, IN CHARGE. BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR, GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE, WASHINGTON, 1861; PART I. GENERAL REPORT. The difficulties of the rapids above Fortification Rock convinced Ives that the river at Fortification Rock was the practical head of navigation 550 miles above the mouth of the river: > I now determined not to try to ascend the Colorado any further. The water > above the Black canon had been shoal, and the current swift. Rapids had > occurred in such quick succession as to make navigation almost impossible, > and there would be no object in proceeding beyond the Great Bend. The > difficulties encountered in the canon were of a character to prevent a > steamboat from attempting to traverse it at low water, and we had seen > drift-wood lodged in clefts fifty feet above the river, betokening a > condition of things during the summer freshet that would render navigation > more hazardous at that season than now. It appeared, therefore, that the > foot of the Black canon should be considered the practical head of > navigation, and I concluded to have a reconnaissance made to connect that > point with the Mormon road, and to let this finish the exploration of the > navigable portion of the Colorado. Returning to the Mohave Villages, he then struck out across northern Arizona to Fort Defiance. Ives reported his findings in his 1861 Report upon the Colorado river of the West Joseph C. Ives, Report upon the Colorado river of the West, Washington, Government Printing Office, 1861. The Ives expedition produced one of the important early maps of the Grand Canyon drawn by Frederick W. von Egloffstein, topographer to the expedition.Rio Colorado of the West / explored by 1st.

Floyd, Secretary of War ; drawn by Frhr. F. W. v. Egloffstein, topographer to the expedition. Ives next served as engineer and architect for the Washington National Monument from 1859 to 1860. At the beginning of American Civil War he declined a promotion to captain and, despite his Northern birth, he joined the Confederate Army in late 1861. He served in several engineering capacities, and was finally appointed aide-de-camp (with rank of colonel) to President Jefferson Davis from 1863 to 1865. After the war he settled in New York City where he died November 12, 1868. In 1855 he married Cora Semmes Ives. New York State Senator and Arizona Territorial Council President Eugene S.

The first of these was the Herreshoff steam generator of 1873. Principles For the sake of efficiency, it is desirable to minimise the steam content of the generator. Heat can then be transferred efficiently into liquid water, rather than into low-density steam. Monotube steam generators may either boil gradually along their length, usually pumped circulation systems, but where this boiling does not disrupt the circulation. Otherwise they can use the Benson supercritical system, where the pressure is sufficient to prevent boiling (within the heated volume) altogether.

The company is currently run by Sean Graney (Artistic Director) and Kelli Strickland (Executive Director). One of Chicago’s premier off-Loop theater companies, The Hypocrites specializes in mounting bold productions that challenge preconceptions and redefining the role of the audience through unusual staging (such as promenade and in-the- round) and direct engagement. The company has a reputation in Chicago for creating exciting, surprising, and deeply engaging theater as it re-interprets well-known works for contemporary audiences, reveling in the absurd while revealing the core of what makes classics classic. > “The Hypocrites, who with each new production, continue to rise not just to > the rank of one of our city’s best storefronts but one of Chicago’s best > theaters period.” – Newcity Stage (American Idiot, 2015) The company has grown significantly in the past few years, receiving acclaim for productions at the Steppenwolf Garage, Goodman Theatre, Museum of Contemporary Art, DCASE Storefront, Chopin Theater and nationally at American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.), Berkeley Repertory Theatre, and Actors Theatre of Louisville.  Adaptations  Their recent production of Graney’s All Our Tragic, a twelve-hour adaptation combining all 32 surviving Greek Tragedies, garnered the company six 2015 Equity Jeff Awards in its first year of eligibility. > “’A watershed moment for off-Loop theater.” – Chris Jones, Chicago Tribune > (All Our Tragic, 2014) Graney’s musical adaptations of Gilbert & Sullivan’s Pirates of Penzance, The Mikado and H.M.S. Pinafore have become audience and critic favorites, being remounted numerous times in Chicago as well as going on tour to American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.), Berkeley Repertory Theatre, Actors Theatre of Louisville, and Olney Theater Center. > “Cromer calibrates 'Our Town' with clear-eyed intelligence. You see the > beauties of small-town America and its limitations, laid out before you as > directly and powerfully as the Chicago theater can muster.” – Chris Jones, > Chicago Tribune (Our Town, 2008)  Awards  Since the company’s founding, The Hypocrites have produced over sixty main stage productions and a dozen festival pieces, securing thirty-one Non-Equity Joseph Jefferson awards, six Equity Joseph Jefferson awards, and two After Dark Awards. The American Theatre Wing, best known as the creator of the Tony Awards, presented The Hypocrites with one of the 2013 National Theatre Company awards. The company's smash-hit production of Our Town, directed by David Cromer, transferred in 2009 to Off-Broadway, Los Angeles and Boston. The Hypocrites began performing in the basement of Café Voltaire, a now defunct vegetarian restaurant in Lakeview. Co-founder Sean Graney has been the artistic director since early 2015, when he announced his return from a three year hiatus. The company's name is inspired by Eugène Ionesco’s Notes and Counter Notes, a compendium of interviews on the nature of theatre throughout which Ionesco regularly contradicts himself — hence its title, and The Hypocrites' name.

Padeniye Berlina) is a 1949 Soviet war film and an example of Soviet realism, in two parts separated in the manner of a serial, directed by Mikheil Chiaureli, released by the Mosfilm Studio. The script was written by Pyotr Pavlenko, and the musical score composed by Dmitri Shostakovich. It starred Mikheil Gelovani as Joseph Stalin. Portraying the history of the Second World War with a focus on a highly positive depiction of the role the Soviet leader played in the events, it is considered one of the most important representations of Stalin's cult of personality. Plot Vladimir Savelyev and Maria Novakova as Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun =Part 1= Alexei Ivanov, a shy steel factory worker, greatly surpasses his production quota and is chosen to receive the Order of Lenin and to have a personal interview with Joseph Stalin. Alexei falls in love with the idealist teacher Natasha, but has difficulties approaching her. When he meets Stalin, who tends his garden, the leader helps him to understand his emotions and tells him to recite poetry to her. Then, they both have a luncheon with the rest of the Soviet leadership in Stalin's home. After returning from Moscow, Alexei confesses his love to Natasha. While they are both having a stroll in a wheat field, their town is attacked by the Germans, who invade the Soviet Union. Alexei loses his consciousness and sinks into a coma. When he awakes, he is told that Natasha is missing and that the Germans are at the gates of Moscow. In the capital, Stalin plans the defense of the city, explaining to the demoralized Georgy Zhukov how to deploy his forces. Alexei volunteers for the Red Army, takes part in the parade in the Red Square and in the Battle of Moscow. At Berlin, after receiving the blessings of his allies – Spain, Turkey, the Vatican, Romania and Japan – and watching a long column of Soviet slaves-laborers, Natasha among them, Adolf Hitler is furious to hear that Moscow has not fallen. He dismisses Walther von Brauchitsch from his office and offers the command of the army to Gerd von Rundstedt; the latter refuses, saying that Stalin is a great captain and Germany's defeat is certain. Hitler orders to attack Stalingrad. In the meanwhile, Hermann Göring negotiates with British capitalist Bedstone, who supplies Germany with needed materials. After the Soviet victory in Stalingrad, Vasily Chuikov tells Ivanov that Stalin is always with the Red Army. The storyline leaps to the Yalta Conference, where Stalin and his Western Allies debate the future of the war. =Part 2= Stalin asks his generals who will take Berlin, they or the Western Allies. The generals answer that they will capture the city. Alexei's Guards Army advances towards Berlin, while Hitler has a nervous breakdown and demands that his soldiers fight to the end. The Germans plan to execute the inmates of the concentration camp in which Natasha is held before the arrival of the Red Army, but Alexei's unit liberates the prisoners before they carry through their design. Natasha faints, and he does not find her. Hitler and the German leadership fall into despair and lose their grip on reality the closer the Soviets get to Berlin. Hitler orders to flood the subway stations as the Soviets approach, drowning thousands of civilians. He then marries Eva Braun and commits suicide. Gen. Hans Krebs carries the news of Hitler's death to the Red Army and begs for a ceasefire. Stalin orders to accept only an unconditional surrender. Alexei is chosen to carry the Victory Banner, alongside Mikhail Yegorov and Meliton Kantaria. Their division storms the Reichstag and the three hoist the banner atop of it. The Germans surrender and Red Army soldiers from throughout the USSR celebrate victory. Stalin's plane lands in Berlin, and he is greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of peoples of \\"all the nations\\", holding posters with his picture and waving various nations' flags. Stalin carries a speech in which he calls for world peace. Standing in the crowd, Alexei and Natasha recognize each other and are reunited. Natasha asks Stalin to let her kiss him on the cheek, and they hug while prisoners praise Stalin in numerous languages. The film ends with Stalin wishing all peace and happiness.

The premier's character appeared in only two pictures during the war. However, as victory seemed secure, Stalin tightened his control over every aspect of the Soviet society, including cinema. After 1945, his cult returned to the screen with greater intensity than ever before, and he was credited as the sole architect of Germany's defeat. Denise J. Youngblood wrote that shortly afterwards, there remained only three kinds of war heroes: \\"the dead, the maimed and Stalin.\\" =Inception= Mikheil Chiaureli, Stalin's favourite director, and writer Pyotr Pavlenko have already collaborated to create the 1946 personality cult picture The Vow. The Soviet Minister of Cinema, Ivan Bolshakov, instructed them both to begin work on The Fall of Berlin shortly after the release of The Vow in July 1946. The film was conceived as the Mosfilm studio's gift to Stalin for his official 70th birthday,Most historians believe that Stalin's date of birth was 18 December 1878, based on various documents. However, Stalin claimed to have been born on 21 December 1879. See the article Joseph Stalin for more information. which was to be held on 21 December 1950. The Fall was supposed to be part of a cycle of ten films about the premier's role in World War II, entitled Stalin's Ten Blows, though not corresponding with the eponymous series of Eastern Front campaigns. The project was only partially fulfilled until Stalin's death. =Development= As with all films in which his character made an appearance, Stalin took a keen interest in the work on The Fall of Berlin. The dictator intervened in Pavlenko's writing, read the screenplay's manuscript and corrected several grammatical mistakes; he also deleted a short sequence during which a German civilian in Berlin exhorted his family to hasten and flee as the Red Army approaches. German historian Lars Karl believed this signaled his resolution to demonstrate that the civilian populace had nothing to fear from the Soviets. The picture was the first feature film about the Battle of Berlin and the events in Hitler's bunker, preceding Der letzte Akt by five years. Edvard Radzinsky claimed his father heard from Pavlenko that Beria told him The Vow was to be a \\"sublime film\\", intended to identify Stalin with Jesus: Lenin, paralleling John the Baptist, recognized him as the Messiah; \\"this seminarist's language betrayed the authorship of this observation\\". Radzinsky added The Fall of Berlin \\"further developed the theme\\", as it ends \\"with an apotheosis: Stalin arrives by plane... In the white attire of an angel descending from the clouds\\", he \\"reveals himself to the expectant humans... They glorify the Messiah in all tongues.\\" Russian historian Alexander Prokhorov believed the film was influenced by Nazi propaganda films. Author John Riley claimed the scene in which Stalin's plane arrives in Berlin – which was fictional; Stalin never flew to the German capital, let alone on the day of the capture of the Reichstag – was modeled after Hitler's landing in Nuremberg from the Triumph of the Will, and that the film's ending was inspired by a similar sequence from Kolberg; the storming of the Reichstag \\"parodied\\" the massacre on the Odessa Steps from Battleship Potemkin, a gesture intended to mock Sergei Eisenstein. According to the memories of Svetlana Aliluyeva, Chiaureli approached her father with the idea to combine the fate of his son, Yakov Dzhugashvili, in the plot. Stalin promptly rejected this. Soviet actor Artyom Karapetian claimed Chiaureli's wife, actress Veriko Anjaparidze, told him Stalin was so outraged when he heard of this that Lavrentiy Beria – who was standing nearby – reached into his trousers' pocket, \\"presumably, for his gun.\\" The director's daughter, Sofiko Chiaureli, recounted that her father \\"knew he was saved\\" when Stalin wiped tears from his eyes as he watched Gelovani descend from the plane and muttered \\"If only I had gone to Berlin.\\" =Principal photography= Chiaureli brought some 10,000 Soviet extras to Berlin for the filming, and also hired many local residents for the tunnel flooding sequence; he was not able to work in the Reichstag as it was located in the British Zone of West Berlin and conducted the photography mainly in the Babelsberg Studios. However, most of the episodes set in the German capital were filmed in ruined cities in the Baltic region. In addition, a scale model of Berlin, over one square kilometer in size, was built in Mosfilm's studios; this miniature was to create the urban combat scenes in the end of Part II. The Soviet Army provided five divisions, their supporting artillery formations, four tank battalions, 193 military aircraft and 45 captured German tanks to recreate the open field battles portrayed in The Fall of Berlin. They consumed 1.5 million liters of fuel during the filming. The Fall of Berlin was one of the first colored films made in the Soviet Union. The producers used Agfacolor reels, taken from UFA's studios in Neubabelsberg. =Music= Composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who was accused of Formalism during 1948, was called on to compose the score. Vano Muradeli said that his contribution to The Fall of Berlin and other Stalinist films was the only thing which saved him from persecution by the establishment. Riley wrote that the film's score, along with Song of the Forests, \\"was the closest Shostakhovich came to overt praise for Stalin.\\" One additional piece of music used in The Fall of Berlin was Felix Mendelssohn's Wedding March, heard during the scene in which Hitler marries Eva Braun; the march was banned in Nazi Germany. According to Riley, it is unclear whether Chiaureli intended to mock the Nazis by portraying them as unable to recognize an item they have forbidden, or he has simply been ignorant of the ban. ;Soundtrack for Part I # Main Title Part 1 (2:44) # Beautiful Day (2:14) [accompanied by a children's chorus singing Beautiful Day; lyrics by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.] # Alyosha By the River (1:39) # Stalins's Garden (2:04) # Alyosha and Natalia in the Fields / Attack (3:55) # Hitler's Reception (1:31) # In the Devastated Village (2:39) # Forward!

In the USSR, it was watched by 38.4 million viewers, becoming the third most popular Soviet movie of 1949. Director Mikheil Chiaureli, writer Piotr Pavlenko, cinematographer Leonid Kosmatov, composer Dmitry Shostakovich and actors Mikheil Gelovani, Boris Andreyev and Vladimir Kenigson were all awarded the Stalin Prize, 1st Class for their work. In Czechoslovakia, the film also won the Crystal Globe in the 5th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. On the day of the film's release, Literaturnaya Gazeta published a column by Aleksandr Stein in which he described the film as \\"wonderful... a truthful portrayal of the relations between the people and the leader... and the love of all people to Stalin.\\" A day after, Vsevolod Pudovkin wrote in Soviet Art: \\"this is an outstanding work of Soviet cinema\\" that presented \\"in profound depth and in vast scale... a bold, creative representation of the subject... a lively demonstration of the ever developing genre of Socialist Realism.\\" The picture was enthusiastically promoted by the Soviet press. A series of articles in Pravda praised it as an authentic representation of history. Public reaction to the film was monitored by the government: in a memorandum to Mikhail Suslov from 11 March 1949, two officials from the Bolshevik All-Union Communist Party's Propaganda Department reported that the newspaper Art and Life received numerous letters from viewers, who – although generally approving of the film – criticized various aspects of the plot; many of them cited Ivanov's boyish conduct as unworthy of a Stakhanovite. Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeni Chernonog, a war veteran, watched The Fall of Berlin while intoxicated. He commented: \\"And where did this angel come from? We have not seen him there\\". He was arrested and condemned to eight years in the Gulag. The East German political establishment excessively promoted the picture, as well; it was officially classified as a documentary, and all servicemen of the Barracked People's Police were obliged to watch it. However, The Fall of Berlin was received with little enthusiasm by the populace. Years later, in an article he wrote for the Deutsche Filmkunst magazine on 30 October 1959, Sigfried Silbermann – director of the state film distributor Progress Film – attributed this response to the effect years of anti-Soviet propaganda had on the German people. French critic Georges Sadoul wrote in Les Lettres Françaises: \\"In the USSR, films are no longer a merchandise... They have become a means to spread ideology, and are produced by engineers of the human soul... Some aesthetics today advocate American film noirs, but in the future only specialists will be interested in these museums of horror, the remains of a dead epoch... While the majority of people will applaud The Fall of Berlin.\\"Sadoul, Georges. La Geste Grandiose et Inoubliable de Staline. Les Lettres Françaises, 25 May 1950. Quoted in: In France, it sold 815,116 tickets.La Chute de Berlin. allocine.fr. When the picture was imported to the UK by the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR in 1952, the British Board of Film Censors considered banning it, especially as it was attacking Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Private screenings of the film were held both for the Members of Parliament in Westminster and for the Prime Minister in his Chartwell residence. Churchill wrote to historian Hugh Trevor-Roper in May, asking about the veracity of the Berlin underground flooding by Hitler, and the latter replied it was \\"mythologizing\\" history. After the Foreign Office concluded the picture was \\"too one-sided to serve as an effective communist propaganda\\", it was released without cuts, with a long disclaimer that stressed \\"the advantages of living in the free British society\\" and that the Soviet screenwriters completely ignored the Western Allies' role in the war. The film became the most successful Soviet or foreign picture about World War II screened in the UK during the 1940s and 1950s. Tony Shaw noted The Fall of Berlin enjoyed mostly positive reviews during its six- week run in London and its subsequent showings in the country, though some also commented it was overblown propaganda; the critics of The Sunday Times and the Evening Standard both opined that the Soviets' obliteration of the UK- US contribution to victory was akin to the same treatment received by the Red Army in Western productions about the war. The film was one of the few foreign-language pictures to be presented in the BBC's program Current Release; former war correspondent Matthew Halton was invited to comment on it. The US magazine Variety described it as \\"The Russian answer to the many US and UK films about the war... having some contemporary significance, in the light of the tensions between the West and the Soviet Union.\\" The New York Times' critic dubbed it as a \\"deafening blend of historical pageantry and wishful thinking... directed as if his (Chiaureli's) life depended upon it\\" and – in what author David Caute claimed was the worst condemnation which could be leveled at it in the day – that it had a \\"Hollywood-style plot\\". He also disapproved of the historical veracity of the Yalta Conference scene, while John Howard Lawson, recently released from prison, praised it as an authentic depiction of events. Officials in Artkino, the picture's US distributor, claimed the film was \\"already witnessed by 1.2 million people\\" in the United States by 9 June 1952, a day after its release there. =De-Stalinization= Stalin's death in March 1953 signaled a sharp turn in the politics of the Eastern Bloc. After Beria was arrested, Chiaureli was instructed by the new rulers to leave Moscow. The Fall of Berlin was withdrawn from circulation. A directive of the Soviet Film Export Bureau to halt its screening reached East Germany in July. During the summer of 1953, the scene featuring Alexei Ivanov dining with Stalin and the other Soviet leaders in Moscow was edited out from all available copies; author Richard Taylor attributed this to the appearance Beria's character had there. In the post-1953 version, Ivanov is introduced to Stalin, and is then shown strolling with Natasha in the wheat field. On 25 February 1956, Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech condemning Stalin's cult of personality in front of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the midst of it, he told the audience: \\"Let us recall the film, The Fall of Berlin. Here only Stalin acts. He issues orders in a hall in which there are many empty chairs. Only one man approaches him to report something to him – it is Poskrebyshev... And where is the military command? Where is the politburo? Where is the government? What are they doing, and with what are they engaged? There is nothing about them in the film. Stalin acts for everybody, he does not reckon with anyone. He asks no one for advice. Everything is shown to the people in this false light. Why? To surround Stalin with glory – contrary to the facts and contrary to historical truth.\\" Following the speech, the film was banned altogether, and all of its copies were placed in the archives. However, it continued to be screened in the People's Republic of China, the leadership of which opposed Khrushchev's criticism of Stalin. The pro-Stalinist protesters in the March 1956 Georgian demonstrations included a request to hold showings of the film in their list of demands. =Critical analysis= Historian Nikolas Hüllbusch viewed The Fall of Berlin as a representation of Stalin's strengthening political power. He compared it to the first fiction film to feature the premier, the 1937 Lenin in 1918, which depicted Stalin as Vladimir Lenin's most devout disciple; and to The Vow, in which he is chosen as Lenin's heir and takes an oath to keep his legacy. In The Fall of Berlin, Lenin has no impact on the plot. Instead of being the state founder's successor, Stalin's legitimacy was now based on his leadership of the USSR during the war. Denise Youngblood wrote that although not the first to portray Stalin as \\"war hero in chief\\" – this was already done in pictures like The Battle of Stalingrad – The Fall of Berlin elevated him to a new status: \\"it deified Stalin.\\" Richard Taylor pointed out the premier was the only decision maker in the plot, the only one responsible for the victory over Germany, and all other characters were either subservient or antagonistic. Stalin's stoic calm was stressed out by deliberately contrasting it to the hysterical rage of Hitler, or to the slow wit of Georgy Zhukov, who was portrayed in accordance with his political status in the late 1940s, after he was shunned by Stalin: Zhukov was not even among the generals who received Stalin in Berlin. Beside this, most characters – from Natasha to Gerd von Rundstedt – praise him as a great leader. Author Katerina Clark discerned that Stalin, beside his function as a great captain, was made the enabler of romantic relationship: before meeting him, Alexei was incapable of expressing his love to Natasha. Slavoj Žižek commented the leader played the part of the \\"magician and the matchmaker who wisely leads the couple to reunion.\\" Alexei's character was not intended to be perceived as an individual,Alexei Ivanov served as the third man in the group carrying the Victory Banner, alongside two historical figures: Mikhail Yegorov and Meliton Kantaria. The other two were officially recognized and were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. There was another person with the two in the Reichstag, though: Alexei Berest, a junior political officer. His part in the operation was silenced until years after Stalin's death. but rather, a symbol to the entire Soviet people: he was depicted as an archetypal worker; his date of birth is given as 25 October 1917 by the Julian Calendar, the day of the October Revolution. The film also made many references to the political situation in Europe. Turkey, which was a neutral country during the war but a rival of the Soviet Union in the Cold War, was portrayed as if it was an Axis state; the Turkish ambassador even greeted Hitler in the name of İsmet İnönü. The Nazi sympathies of Vatican ambassador Cesare Orsenigo were emphasized as well. Churchill, seen as an enemy after his 1946 Fulton Speech, was portrayed in a highly negative fashion. It is regarded by many critics as the epitome of Stalin's cult of personality in cinema: Denise Youngblood wrote \\"it was impossible to go further\\" in the \\"veneration\\" of him; Philip Boobbyer claimed the cult reached \\"extraordinary proportions\\" with its release; Lars Karl opined it \\"stood above any other part of the cult\\"; Slavoj Žižek regarded it as the \\"supreme case of the Stalinist epic\\" Nikolas Hüllbusch commented that it was the \\"zenith\\" of the representation of Stalin's screen \\"alter-ego\\"; and Richard Taylor believed it was \\"the apotheosis of Stalin's cult of Stalin\\". =Restoration= In 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, The Fall of Berlin had its first public screening in thirty-five years, during the 48th Venice International Film Festival. In 1993, Dušan Makavejev included footage from the film in his picture Gorilla Bathes at Noon. In 2003, the film was remastered by a company from Toulouse, in a relatively poor quality.

Founded in 1953, it is based in a former manor house built from 1772 to 1777. History =Krogerup Manor= The earliest certain reference to Krogerup is from 1577, although Krogerup may be identical to a \\"Krwwerup\\" mentioned in the records of Æbelholt Abbey in the beginning of the 16th century. In the mid-17th century, the estate belonged to Hans Rostgaard, a civil servant who was active in the combat against invading Swedish troops. His bibliognostic son Frederik Rostgaard withdrew to Krogerup when he was banished from the Royal Court in Copenhagen in 1724 after accusations of corruption. Later Krogerup was acquired by the noble family van der Maase and under their ownership the first known Krogerup building was constructed in 1776. Constantin Brun, a successful merchant and royal administrator of trade in the Danish West Indies, bought the property in 1812 for his sons who were farmers and politicians . They added an extra floor to the main building and planted many rare trees. The Brun family owned Krogerup until 1939. By then the estate was deep in debt, and when the last Brun to own it died, none of the heirs wished to inherit the property. =State ownership and Nazi confiscation= The Danish state therefore took over Krogerup and during World War II it was, for a while, used as a police academy by the Danish police force. When the Nazi occupants took control of the Danish police force in 1944, the HIPO Corps took over and ravaged the building. Following the Liberation of Denmark, the building was left vacant for more than a year. =The folk high school= In November 1946, Krogerup Folk High School was established by Hal Koch and five teachers and the first group of 30 students stayed in intermistic barracks and helped with finishing the school. Hal Koch's school was met with scepticism by the Danish folk high school movement and other national romantic Grundtvigian circles. It dealt with such academic elements as European humanism, human rights, democracy and politics that were unfamiliar elements for the folk high school movement which, since its establishment in 1834, had focused on Danish and Nordic history and national identity as manifested in the countryside. The original main building of the manor house has been listed but new buildings have been added in 1958, 1970, 1988 and 1999.

She is mostly remembered now for writing the texts to at least nine of Joseph Haydn's 14 songs in English. She entertained the leading Bluestockings at their house. She was the wife of surgeon John Hunter and his anatomical collections in their marital home eventually formed the basis for the Hunterian Museum. Biography Hunter was the eldest daughter of surgeon Robert Boyne Home of Greenlaw Castle, Berwickshire.. In July 1771 she married John Hunter, one of the most distinguished scientists and surgeons of his day. Her brother Everard Home apprenticed to her husband as surgeon. Her social literary parties were among the most enjoyable of her time, though not always to her husband's taste. The Bluestockings Elizabeth Carter and Mary Delany were her attached friends. Her husband's sister was widowed in 1778, which led indirectly to Dorothea and her children moving to London a few years later. Anne Hunter proved an inspiration to the young Joanna Baillie, who devoted herself seriously to writing poetry and drama. On John Hunter's death in 1793, his widow was left ill provided for. For some time she was indebted for a maintenance partly to the queen's bounty and to the generosity of Dr. Maxwell Garthshore, and partly to the sale of her husband's furniture, library, and curiosities.(Ottley, Life of Hunter, pp. 137–9) Her son-in-law, Sir James Campbell of Inverneill, provided her with a small annuity, and in 1799 Parliament voted to give her ₤15,000 for her husband's collections, which finally placed her in fair circumstances. (This became The Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London; when his anatomist brother to William died in 1783, he bequeathed his collection to Glasgow, where it became the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery.) Anne Hunter had four children, of whom two, a son and a daughter, survived her. She lived in retirement in London till her death on 7 January 1821. Poetry and songs As a young woman she had gained some note as a lyrical poet, her \\"Flower of the Forest\\" appearing in The Lark, an Edinburgh periodical, in 1765. Thirty-two years later she wrote \\"Sports of the Genii\\" to a set of graceful drawings by Susan Macdonald (d. 1803), eldest daughter of Lord-chief-baron Macdonald; these display humour and fancy. She published a volume of poems in 1802 which ran to a second edition the following year. The conservative magazine British Critic suggests that her poems show no depth of thought, but have a natural feeling and simplicity of expression, which make many of them worth reading.British Critic, October 1802, xx. 409-13 Haydn set a number of her songs to music, including \\"My Mother bids me bind my Hair,\\" originally written to an air of Pleyel's. Her relationship with Haydn is ambiguous, though at the time of his visit she was a widow. Songs by Haydn on her texts include The Mermaid's Song, Fidelity, Pleasing Pain, and The Spirit's Song and a libretto for The Creation, which was based on John Milton's Paradise Lost.Caroline Grigson. 2009.

Plot On April 1944, Joseph Stalin orders the Red Army to liberate the Crimea from the German occupiers. The Wehrmacht's local commanders beg Hitler to allow them to retreat from the vulnerable position, but he refuses. After a fierce battle, the Soviet forces destroy the German and Romanian units defending the peninsula and retake Sevastopol. Production The film's title was derived from the third of Stalin's ten blows, the Crimean Offensive of Spring 1944, which served as the setting for the story.The Third Blow on ruskino.ru. The Third Blow was the first of the 'Artistic Documentaries', a series of large-scale Soviet screen productions which were meant to present the official interpretation of the USSR's history, especially the history of the Second World War. As all the artistic documentaries concerned with the war, The Third Blow consisted mainly of battle scenes, strewn with staff meetings of the Red Army's generals and Stalin. In addition, there were short episodes portraying the common soldiers and ordinary people participating in the events.Mira and Antonin Liehm, The Most Important Art, . Page 58. The film, in compliance with Stalin's cult of personality, presented the Soviet leader in a highly favorable manner, centering on his role as the supreme commander. Aleksei Dikiy, who performed his role, was reportedly Stalin's favorite for depicting himself.Richard Taylor, Film Propaganda. . Page 228. Reception The film won the 1948 Gottwaldov Workers' Film Festival Award and a 2nd degree Stalin Prize at 1949. Arkadi Perventsev received the Award for Best Writing in the 1948 Karlovy Vary Film Festival for his work on the script.The Third Blow on Film.ru. French film critic André Bazin described the film as Stalinistic propaganda, writing that in The Third Blow: \\"Stalin mediates alone for a long time and.... He alone decides what measures would be taken... Vasilevsky is still there, but acts solely as a confidant, doubtless to save Stalin from appearing ridiculous by talking to himself.\\"Bazin at Work, . Page 28. In the Nikita Khrushchev years, after the de-Stalinization, many of the scenes involving Stalin were edited out of the film and it was re-released at 1965 under the title Southern Knot (Южный узел).The Third Blow on kino-teatr.ru.

The North Country consists of Clinton County, Essex County, Franklin County, Jefferson County, Lewis County, and St. Lawrence County. When counties were first formed in 1683 the entire area was theoretically under the jurisdiction of Albany County though actually wilderness inhabited by Native Americans, by 1764 most of the area became effectively controlled by Albany County. The state would sell off this land to settlers and speculators, most notably as part of the Old Military Tract (1786) to veterans of the US Revolutionary War and as Macomb's Purchase (1791) to Alexander Macomb. In 1772 the northern and western portions of Albany County was divided into two counties- Tryon and Charlotte. Tryon encompassed Lewis, Jefferson, and St. Lawrence counties along with the western section of Franklin; Tryon was renamed Montgomery in 1784. Charlotte encompassed Clinton, Essex, and the majority of Franklin County; the name of the county was changed to Washington County in 1784. In 1788 Clinton County was split from Washington, Essex was formed from Clinton in 1799 and Franklin was formed from Clinton in 1808. Montgomery County's North Country area went to Herkimer County on that county's formation in 1791, but western Franklin and eastern St. Lawrence were returned to Montgomery in 1797. In 1798 Lewis, Jefferson, and western St. Lawrence became part of the newly formed Oneida County from Herkimer in 1798, leaving only central St. Lawrence County as part of Herkimer. In 1801 the future St. Lawrence and Franklin counties which were portions of Montgomery, Herkimer, and Oneida were transferred to Clinton County; the next year in 1802 St. Lawrence was formed as a county. In 1805 both Lewis and Jefferson counties were formed from Oneida County. In 1785, the township of Plattsburgh was formed in Washington County, and the next year all of Washington County was divided into townships, including the formation of Crown Point township which included all of future Essex County while Plattsburgh was expanded to include most of future Clinton County and Franklin counties. Towns in Franklin can all be traced back to Chateaugay, formed in 1799 a descendant of Plattsburgh. All the towns of Jefferson and Lewis counties can be traced back to Whitestown a town formed in Montgomery County in 1788. In 1801, a year before St. Lawrence County was formed the area of the county, which was 10 survey townships, was combined as the town of Lisbon, all towns in the county are descended from Lisbon. New York experimented with different types of municipalities before settling upon the current format of towns and cities occupying all the land in a county, and all previous forms were transformed into towns (or divided into multiple towns) in 1788 when all of the state of New York was divided into towns. Some early forms of government in earlier years included land patents with some municipal rights, districts, precincts, and boroughs. Though originally intended to be mere “…involuntary subdivisions of the state, constituted for the purpose of the more convenient exercise of governmental functions by the state for the benefit of all its citizens” as defined by the courts in 1916 (Short v. Town of Orange), towns gained home rule powers from the state in 1964, at which time towns became \\"a municipal corporation comprising the inhabitants within its boundaries, and formed with the purpose of exercising such powers and discharging such duties of local government and administration of public affairs as have been, or, maybe [sic] conferred or imposed upon it by law.” The following is a timeline showing the creation of the current towns from their predecessors stretching back to the earliest municipal entity over the area. The timelines only represent which town(s) a particular town was created from and does not represent annexations of territory to and from towns that already existed. All municipalities are towns unless otherwise noted as patent, township, borough, district, or city.

The script was written by Nikolai Virta. Plot =Film I= In the Kremlin, Stalin analyzes the Wehrmacht's movements and concludes that the Germans aim to capture Stalingrad. Hitler, who believes the city is the key to final victory, orders his generals take it at all costs. As the enemy approaches Stalingrad, the Red Army and the local population rally to defend it in bitter house-to-house combat, stalling the German advance. In Moscow, Stalin plans the counter- offensive. =Film II= The Wehrmacht launches a last, massive assault, intended to overwhelm the defenders of Stalingrad. As the Red Army is pushed back to the Volga, Stalin orders the commencement of Operation Uranus. The German 6th Army is encircled, and efforts to relieve the Stalingrad pocket fail. General Friedrich Paulus, ordered by Hitler to hold to the end, refuses to surrender while his soldiers starve. The Soviets close on the city, battering the German forces as they advance. After Red Army soldiers enter his command post, Paulus orders his remaining troops to surrender.

The group was formed after the fall of the monarchy and the defeat of monarchist parties in the 1931 elections, in order to defend the interests of Roman Catholics in the new Spanish Republic.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War, Pelican Books, 1971, p. 95 It emanated from the Asociación Católica Nacional de Propagandistas and effectively formed a political party drawn from this hard-line monarchist movement.Edouard de Blaye, Franco and the Politics of Spain, Penguin Books, 1976, pp. 26-7 The main leader of Popular Action was editor of El Debate and future cardinal Ángel Herrera Oria.de Blaye, Franco, p. 27 In 1932, the National Alliance had to change its name, because parties and political movements were prohibited to use the word \\"national\\" in their names. The Popular Action sought to unite the right-wing, monarchist and Catholic camp and thus became the core of a conservative federation of parties, the Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups (CEDA), established in 1933. Even after the formation of CEDA the party's youth movement, Juventudes de Acción Popular (commonly known as the Greenshirts) continued to organise.

The four levers at the side are probably decorations, but could have been slider controls. A residence organ (also known variously as a house, box, cabinet, choir, continuo, home, practice, trunk, or chamber organ) is a musical organ installed in a personal home. Strictly speaking, the names residence and house organ are the most correct, the others being types of organs that can physically be used as residence organs, but that are not restricted to use solely in that context, and can also be used in, say, small churches, theatres, and so forth. A portative organ or a positive organ (which are also, but imprecisely, known as box, trunk, and cabinet organs) can be used in a residential setting, but the notion of a residence organ strictly embodies a permanence of place that is belied by the notion of portability embodied by the portatives and positives. Similarly, a chamber organ (also known imprecisely as a cabinet, desk, or bureau organ) is in general a small organ for a room, but not necessarily for a room of someone's home.  Use, construction, and evolution  The overlap of definitions parallels an overlap of uses. Residence organs can be used as practice organs, for practice at home by a professional organist, or as home instruments for amateur organists. Their use can be traced as far back as the 16th century where Henry VIII of England owned more than a dozen residence organs, as did many members of his nobility. In construction, they are generally less elaborate than church organs, being constricted by the relative paucity of space for the mechanisms in a residence as opposed to a church, theatre, or other larger building. They commonly have no pedals, a few stops, and a single manual. They are also generally less ornate than other kinds of organs, having plainer façades as the major effort in their construction goes towards miniaturization of the mechanism and achieving a church organ sound with domestic acoustics. Various construction techniques are employed in pursuit of the latter goal. The lengthy pipework of the low registers in a church organ simply doesn't fit into a home, and so devices such as a quint, a Haskell bass, and a stopped pipe are employed to achieve the same sound but with more compact mechanisms. The action is also engineered for compactness. In early designs, the action was very simple and comprised a sprung arrangement where air was compressed in the lower chest of the organ, and depressing a key would open a pallet that would release the air up to the pipe ranks. Later designs, as technology progressed, started to encompass more of what could be found in church and other organs and more complex mechanisms, including rollerboards, pedalboards, reed organs (rather than pipes), and eventually electric rather than mechanical actions. Such residence organs were the province of professional house organ makers (who continue to exist even today) in the main, with a notable exception of Toggenburg where (at that time) residence organs were often constructed by amateurs and enthusiasts themselves. Several such purpose-built residence organs survive from centuries past, including Claudio Merulo's organ in the Conservatory of Music in Parma, and the residence organ of Marie Antoinette that is preserved at Versailles. For comparison, out of the 761 residence organs built by Aeolian between 1894 and 1932, only 65 survived to the end of the 20th century. (One such was the one at Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania.) Residence organs rose to greater popularity in the 17th century, and by the 18th century much larger ones were being built, in England, Holland, and France. It was the end of the 19th century and the turn of the 20th that saw the advent of large and complex purpose-built residence organs in the private homes of those wealthy enough to afford such things, usually not played by the owners themselves but by professional organists whose services they would hire, for private concerts and the like. A four- manual organ was built in Blenheim Palace in 1891 by the Willis company, for example, and such things were symbols of ostentation and opulence on the parts of their owners. But things changed in the 20th century with the advent of new technologies. Right at the start of the century the paper-roll playing mechanisms of the pianola were incorporated into residence organs, which had the side-effect of eliminating the profession of residence organist, requiring the operator to do no more than operate the organ stops and expression pedals (which, in its turn, was eliminated within a decade, that too being encoded onto the paper roll itself). Residence organs in the 1930s grew to encompass an even wider range of instruments with the advent of the electronic organ and (later) the analogue synthesizer as home organs.

She first drew notice as a teenager for her revolutionary poetry which was published in an Odessa newspaper. She began her professional singing career as an opera singer in Europe during the second decade of the 20th century. By the time of her relocation to the United States in 1924, she had abandoned her opera career in favor of performing as a concert soloist and recitalist. As a recitalist Kremer not only sang works from the classical repertoire, but also performed folk music from a variety of countries and in many languages. She was possibly the first woman to perform Yiddish song on the concert stage. In 1927 she began performing as a vaudeville artist while continuing to perform extensively as a recitalist. In 1938, she moved to Argentina where she lived the last 18 years of her life. In 2000 her life was the subject of a television documentary entitled Isa Kremer: The People's Diva which was made for The Jewish Channel. Early life and career in Europe Kremer was born to Jewish parents in the city of Belz which was then part of the territory known as Bessarabia under Russian Imperial rule. Her father, Jacob Kremer, was a provision master in the army of Czar Nicholas II. Her mother, Anna Kremer (née Rosenbluth), was a lover of music and passed on that love to her daughter. The family was part of the bourgeois class and Isa was brought up under the care of a governess and attended a private school operated by the Russian Orthodox Church. The family moved to Odessa when Isa was 12.Zalmen Zylbercweig, Leksikon fun Yidishn teater, Book four, p. 3641 As a teenager, Kremer began working as a poet; writing revolutionary poetry for a newspaper in Odessa. The newspaper's editor, Israel Heifetz, took an interest in Kremer and provided her with the funds to pursue studies in opera with Pollione Ronzi in Milan from 1902-1911. She was forced to stop studying and begin concertizing when her father's business failed; her mother came to her in Italy and she supported them both. She made her professional opera debut in 1911 at the Teatro Ponchielli in Cremona as Mimì in Giacomo Puccini's La bohème to the Rodolfo of Tito Schipa. She was then active as principal artist at the Mariinsky Theatre (then known as the Petrograd Opera) in Saint Petersburg where she starred in several operettas and was heard in various works from the concert repertoire. Some of the roles she sang there were Dolly in Franz Lehár's Endlich allein, Elvira in Lehar's Die ideale Gattin, Helen in Oskar Nedbal's Polská krev, and Laura in Karl Millöcker's Der Bettelstudent. She was later active at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow in 1915. In 1914, Kremer returned to Odessa and for two years appeared in roles at the Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater; including portraying Mimì and the role of Violetta in Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata. \\"It was there she first discovered that her singing talent was not most suited to arias and she turned to folk music in Yiddish and other languages.\\" She became highly active in intellectual circles, and notably became close friends with Sholem Aleichem, Hayim Nahman Bialik, Mendele Mocher Sforim, and Mark Warshawski. It was Bialik who inspired her to begin collecting Yiddish music and to include it in her concerts. Up to this point, Yiddish music had been performed solely by men, usually hazzans, within concerts. She gave her first folk concert in Moscow and it was a great success; from there she went to Turkey and later toured in Poland, German, France, England and elsewhere. She married the Israel Heifetz, Russian Jewish editor of the Odessa News, who was 27 years older than she was. Their marriage produced one child, their daughter Toussia who was born in 1917. In 1922, Kremer came to America, where her concerts were very successful. M. Osherovitsh wrote: \\"Hearing Isa Kremer sing Yiddish folksongs is a must for the Jewish intelligentsia. While Odessa was her home, Kremer was also actively performing as a guest artist throughout Europe in concerts, operettas, and operas during the second decade of the 20th century. Among the roles in her stage repertoire were Tatyana in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin and the title heroines in Jules Massenet's Manon and Puccini's Madama Butterfly. While on tour to Constantinople in 1917, the Russian Revolution occurred which proved ill fortune for Kremer and her family who were known supporters of Alexander Kerensky. The family's Odessa property was confiscated, Heifetz was imprisoned, and their daughter, governess, and Kremer's parents were forbidden from leaving the city. Kremer was eventually able to smuggle her family out of the city into Poland in 1919. The following year she managed to bribe city officials to release her husband from jail. While this family drama was going on, she made several recordings in Constantinople on the Orfeon label between 1918-1920. After Kremer and her family were all reunited in Poland in 1920, the family lived briefly in Berlin but ultimately settled in Paris, France. Soon thereafter, Kremer separated from her husband. Heifetz later died while a prisoner at the Nazi concentration camp Fort Breendonk during World War II. In 1922, Kremer gave a concert tour of Poland which included performances of Jewish songs. A year later she told Jessie Abrams of The Canadian Jewish Chronicle that upon reaching Warsaw, her scheduled concert sparked an anti-Semitic riot outside the Philharmonic Concert Hall.Jesse Abrams, Isa Kremer, A Child of the People, The Canadian Jewish Chronicle (14 September 1923)[\\"Chwila Poniedziałkowa\\"] The riot, she later said, and other experiences of antisemitism in Europe, prompted her to relocate to the United States. Life and career in the United States Kremer first came to the United States in the autumn of 1922; arriving in New York City where she signed a contract with artistic manager Sol Hurok. She made her acclaimed American concert debut at Carnegie Hall on 29 October 1922. She eventually moved to the United States with her daughter and parents in 1924; ultimately becoming a United States citizen. She appeared regularly in concerts in NYC at Carnegie Hall and the Manhattan Opera House over the next two decades; making her final New York appearance on 3 December 1950 at Carnegie Hall. She was chiefly known in the United States as a folk singer; performing folk songs in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Yiddish. On 27 September 1927 she made her vaudeville debut at the Palace Theatre. That same year she made talking films for Vitaphone. She later starred in a musical at a theatre on Second Avenue in the Yiddish Theater District in 1930 opposite Seymour Rechzeit which was entitled The Song of the Ghetto. One of the songs in the musical, \\"Mayn shtetele Belz\\", was written for her by American-Jewish composer Alexander Olshanetsky. The song was about her native city and became quite famous. She also made recordings in the United States with Brunswick Records and Columbia Records. While living in the United States, Kremer continued to tour extensively throughout the world during the 1920s and 1930s. She gave tours in the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa, Palestine, and Latin America. On many occasions, she was confronted by antisemitism; but in spite of this continued to include Jewish songs in nearly all her concerts. She notably insisted upon including Yiddish songs in her concerts at Berlin’s Jüdischer Kulturbund, an institution created with the consent of the Nazis for the purpose of presenting performances for the Jewish population after Jewish performers were no longer hireable in \\"Aryan theatres.\\" In 1931, a book of twenty-four Yiddish folk songs named after Kremer’s popular concert series, A Jewish Life in Song was published by Chappell & Co. in London. Final years in Argentina In 1938 Kremer emigrated to Argentina. There she met the lauded psychiatrist Dr. Gregorio Bermann who operated a highly successful practice in Buenos Aires. The couple lived together in Argentina until Isa's death of stomach cancer at the age of 69 in Córdoba, Argentina in 1956. Her daughter, Toussia, remained in the United States, marrying Dr. Kermit Pines of New Jersey. In Argentina, Kremer suffered much hardship. Bermann was a socialist and close to the communist party and both husband and wife were blacklisted by the dictator Juan Perón. As a result, they experienced serious financial difficulties and political harassment during the 1940s and 1950s. Many of her concerts in that country during those years were for benefits that aided Nazi victims or striking workers. Several of these concerts were given in collaboration with the exiled Spanish Republican writer María Teresa León. After her death, her archives were donated to the Instituto Judio de Investigaciones in Buenos Aires. They include her vast concert repertoire of folk music; which encompasses works in a total of 24 languages.

John Smith Archibald (1872–1934) first trained with local architect William Maclntosh in his home town of Inverness, Scotland. In 1893 he emigrated to Canada and worked with Edward Maxwell in Montreal as a draughtsman and assistant. In 1897 he formed a partnership with another former Maxwell draughtsman, Charles Jewett Saxe (1870–1943), which lasted until 1915. Archibald's designs included a number of stations and hotels for the Canadian National Railway. He designed sports buildings including the Montreal Forum, several schools, churches, commercial buildings, and hospitals, as well as residential buildings in Montreal and Kingston, Ontario. After his death in 1934, Archibald's practice was continued by his son Ian T. Archibald and Hugh Percival Illsley. They were later joined by Francis Orr Templeton to form the firm of Archibald, Illsley and Templeton which practised in Montreal until 1950. John Schofield immigrated to Canada from Ireland in the early 1900s. In 1907, he became the draftsman for the Canadian Northern Railway in Winnipeg. After the Canadian National Railway formed in 1920, he was the main architect, based in Montreal. Schofield was involved in almost every design of the CNR stations and hotels. He retired in 1948.

Formed in November 1939 as part of the 5th Brigade, 2nd Division of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force. After undertaking training at Burnham Camp the battalion sailed from New Zealand on 1 May 1940. The battalion saw action in Greece, Crete, North Africa, and Italy. History =Formation and training= Following the outbreak of the Second World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), for service at home and abroad. Following consultation with the British government, it was decided that the main New Zealand contribution to the war effort would be in the form of an infantry division, the 2nd New Zealand Division, under the command of Major General Bernard Freyberg. The new division would require nine battalions of infantry and consequently, several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers. The 23rd Battalion, also known as the Canterbury-Otago Battalion, was formed in January 1940 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel A. S. Falconer. It was the last of three infantry battalions designated to make up the second echelon of the 2nd New Zealand Division, destined for overseas service. Its personnel were all volunteers were drawn from the South Island of New Zealand. They were formed into four rifle companies, designated A to D and corresponding to the Canterbury, Southland, Nelson/Marlborough/West Coast and Otago districts. After completing rudimentary training, the battalion embarked for England in May 1940 as part of the 5th Infantry Brigade, 2nd New Zealand Division. Sailing on the transport Andes, they made port calls at Perth, in Australia, Cape Town, and Freetown before arriving at Gourock, in Scotland, in June. Following this, the battalion spent the remainder of the year on garrison duties in the south of England where they were positioned to respond in case of a cross-Channel invasion by the Germans in the wake of the Fall of France. Commanding officers The following officers served as commanding officer of 23rd Battalion: * Lieutenant Colonel A. S. Falconer (January–August 1940; March–May 1941); * Lieutenant Colonel D. F.

A committed Suffragette, she was the first woman to conduct at the Royal Albert Hall, London, and the first female president of the National Eisteddfod of Wales. Life Needham was born in Oldcastle, Co. Meath, her maiden name was Montgomery. She went to boarding school in Derry for four years and spent the following year in Castletown, Isle of Man. She studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, first for one year only (most likely the academic year 1880-1): piano with the Irish pianist and composer Arthur O'Leary, harmony and counterpoint with Frank Davenport and occasionally with George Alexander Macfarren and Ebenezer Prout. It is not clear what she did in the intervening three years before she resumed her studies in 1884, but she then graduated in 1887 and became a Licentiate of the Academy in 1889. In 1893 she also passed the examinations to the Associateship of the Royal College of Music. In the meantime she had married the London-based physician Joseph Needham in 1892 and in 1900 gave birth to their only child, also called Joseph. Actively supported by her husband, who organised concerts for her and arranged her earliest publications, her musical career began in 1894 with a number of publications and piano and song recitals. Altogether she wrote some 700 compositions, most of which songs, but there are also some duets, trios and quartets for voices and piano, some piano music, some orchestrations of songs, choral hymns, marches for brass bands, and one church service. More than 200 published works can be found in the British Library, some of which are song cycles and similar collections with up to 12 pieces. She seems to have stopped composing before 1920 and little was heard of her henceforth. She died, largely unnoticed by the public, on Christmas Eve 1945 in London. Thanks to her son Joseph Needham's later fame as a highly distinguished biochemist and sinologist, the private belongings – including the papers of his mother – of him were archived, first at the University of Bath, and now in Cambridge. This includes published music, private and professional correspondence for the years 1877 to 1921, extensive diaries covering the years 1879 to 1924, photographs, notebooks, etc.This foregoing account is based mainly on her typescript autobiography entitled \\"A Daughter of Music\\", archived in Cambridge among the \\"Joseph Needham Papers\\" as \\"Ms.Needham:A.97\\". The overview of the \\"Joseph Needham Papers\\" at Cambridge mentions that her extensive diaries reveal a very unhappy marriage, but there is no word about it in her typescript autobiography, which she had intended for publication. In this source she describes her early career from the mid-1890s thus: \\"For ten years, I might say twenty years and more, songs, piano soli, quartettes, trios, song cycles, hymns, all flowed from my happy pen. They were so prolific, these years, that I sometimes, if tired, feared to look at a poetry book lest a poem might strike me and set itself instantaneously to music in my head, and I should be inclined to run away and set it down.”Page 28 of her typescript autobiography. An active member to and benefactress of the Pan-Celtic movement which existed from 1899 until c. 1910, and one of the attendants of the Pan-Celtic Congress of Caernarfon of 1904 (who was photographed there in Celtic revival dress and modern dress), she was made the first woman President of the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1906, with fellow presidents of the calibre like the Lord Mayor and the Bishop of London and two lords. A few years later she was also made a \\"Bardess of Wales\\", i.e. a member of the Welsh Gorsedd of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, under the title \\"Harp of Ireland\\". She was the first woman to conduct at the Royal Albert Hall. And in 1910 she was a V.I.P. at a banquet given in Dublin by Lord Aberdeen, the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, to honour 'Irish Women of Letters'.See Níc Pheadair (1916) Her biggest single commercial success was when she won the competition for the Prize Song for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. More than 300 composers sent in their contribution, and Alicia Needham went away with the £100 award for a song which she wrote in a last-minute fashion while she was accidentally staying in a room at Dublin's Shelbourne Hotel.Autobiography The death of her husband in 1920 meant a serious change in Alicia Needham's course of life. She was forced to sell the house and furniture, paintings, books and china and had to move into a considerably smaller flat in a less fashionable district of the city. She writes in her autobiography (p. 67-8): \\"[...] my music-room shelves left empty, and four tons of books sent away to storage, all the best things and treasures sold, I only keeping enough for a little flat!\\". She probably lived from the sales of the house and family possessions for a few years, but her decline is clearly visible in that she doesn't seem to have composed any more after 1920, her collection of correspondence ends in 1921, her diaries end in 1924, her autobiography in 1926. The \\"Joseph Needham Papers\\" in Cambridge reveal that she turned to astrology and occultism; she began to believe in the rebirthing of the dead and devoted time to so-called \\"spirit photography\\". Notices in the Irish Times\\"The Irish Times\\", 26 June 1933, p. 6 and the British Medical JournalThe British Medical Journal, 14 October 1933, p. 716 of 1933 reveal that by then she was in serious financial difficulty and had health problems, with a Dr. J.S. Crone of the Irish Literary Society organising a \\"testimonial\\".

Unlike most neighbouring countries in the Pacific, Samoa has established party politics. The major contesting parties were that of incumbent Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP); and the Tautua Samoa Party (TSP), a newly formed opposition party which included candidates from recently disbanded parties like the Samoa Party. The result was a landslide victory for the HRPP, which secured 36 out of the 49 seats available. The TSP won the remaining 13 seats. Tuilaepa won his seat unopposed and will continue as prime minister. Electoral system Samoa's legislative assembly, the Fono, is composed of 49 seats, each serving a five-year term. Forty-seven members are elected from the forty-one village-based constituencies (four of the larger electorates have two representatives each), while two members are elected by independent voters with no village affiliation. Only chiefs (matai) may stand for election to the forty-seven village-based seats, while the other two are open to anybody. Once the results of the election are confirmed, the Prime Minister is then appointed by the head of state, the O le Ao o le Malo. Party platforms The Human Rights Protection Party promised to focus on health, education, agriculture, infrastructural development, the development of renewable energy, and a pledge to \\"turn Samoa into the sports hub of the Pacific\\". In a speech on 22 February, the Prime Minister emphasised the party's maturity and experience in government. He promised continuity in policies, and drew attention to what he described as the government's major achievements in recent years: the election of the head of state; the development of infrastructure; economic growth, and the development of businesses and the private sector; a well-managed budget; the hosting of the 2007 Pacific Games; the switching from right- to left-hand driving throughout the country (in fact an extremely controversial policy, which generated the largest protest in Samoan history\\"Samoa provokes fury by switching sides of the road\\", The Telegraph, 3 July 2009); and the government's response to the 2009 earthquake and tsunami. For the future, he announced a broad range of policies to improve Samoans' health, including an increase in the number of locally trained medical staff, an increase in the number of hospitals, a policy of compulsory twice-a-year testing of all Samoans to detect cancer in advance, and the promotion of organic farming, along with a \\"bonus scheme\\" to reduce the use of chemicals and pesticides in agriculture, to facilitate healthier diets. He stated that these promises could all be realistically financed, and concluded: \\"Your one vote can set the direction of Samoa for the next five years. It’s very important who you choose because you could benefit or you will bring a curse on you and your family for the next five years. So vote for the HRPP and be blessed\\".\\"HRPP unveils vote plan\\" , Samoa Observer, 23 February 2011 The Tautua Samoa Party promised to focus on lowering the cost of living, and halting the government's Casino and Gambling Bill, which would legalise casino gaming in the country. The Value Added Goods and Services Tax would be abolished; pensions would be raised for the elderly; children below the age of 12 would receive free health care. The party also promised to \\"encourage farming and develop agriculture\\"; \\"lower the cost of electricity and other utilities\\"; \\" develop education and health services through the raising of salaries and enforcing compulsory education\\"; and promote the development of the private sector. Asked how these promises would be funded, in particular considering the promised abolition of VAGST, the party's deputy leader, Palusalue Fa’apo II, stated that \\"God will provide for us\\", and that the party would seek additional international aid. He added that the HRPP government had \\"wasted millions on unnecessary developments such as the new buildings towering over everything in Apia\\", and that under a TSP government all public spending would be transparent and accountable.\\"Tautua promises change\\" , Samoa Observer, 13 February 2011 Controversy =Tu‘ula Tuitui= Less than a month prior to the election, it emerged that the Tautua Samoa Party's candidate in Prime Minister Tuilaepa's constituency might not be permitted to stand, as the mayor of his village was refusing to provide the legally necessary confirmation that he had served his village, Saleapaga. The candidate, Tu‘ula Tuitui, stated he had provided proof to the mayor that he had worked for the village in various ways, notably by taking part in recovery work after the recent earthquake and tsunami. He added that \\"chiefs and orators of Saleapaga ha[d] asked him several times not to run against Tuilaepa\\". Were Tuitui to be prevented from standing, the Prime Minister would retain his seat in Parliament uncontested. On 12 February 2011 two more candidates were prevented from standing for the same reason. =Public servants= On 8 February 2011 it was reported that public servants running for Parliament had been ordered to resign, in contravention of Samoa's electoral act. The Electoral Act allows public servants to take special leave to contest elections.Electoral Act 1963, section 8. =Eastern Samoans= At the beginning of March, it was announced by the electoral commissioner in American Samoa that American Samoans who cast ballots in Western Samoa's election would be subsequently ineligible to vote in their own country. Under United States electoral laws, a voter can be disqualified from voting if they vote in another country's election.

There are four conserved troubadour poems, all with refrains and three by Guiraut Riquier with music, that are labelled retronchas in the chansonniers. Six rotrouenges survive, but only one with music, and four of them are attributed to one trouvère, Gontier de Soignies.Jane Bellingham. \\"Rotrouenge.\\" The Oxford Companion to Music. Ed. Alison Latham. Oxford Music Online. 5 Oct. 2010. Medieval Occitan treatises state that the retroencha always has a refrain, but modern scholars have found no other distinguishing characteristic. Pioneering work in singling out and identifying the rotroencha was made by Alfred Jeanroy. In the twentieth century, the German scholars Friedrich Gennrich and Hans Spanke developed two distinct theories about the textual and melodic form of the rotrouenge, implicitly suggesting in the process that some of the few specimens of lyric labelled as such in the manuscripts are in fact mis-labelled and do not represent the rotrouenge. The French scholar Jean Frappier noted that \\"we are not absolutely sure that we have any authentic specimens of the rotrouenge\\", indicating that by the time the term came into use in the late twelfth century it was no more than an archaism (\\"an attractive old term\\" in the words of Hendrik van der Werf) and that the original genre may have lost its distinct identity.Hendrik van der Werf. \\"Rotrouenge.\\" Grove Music Online.

After 1890, the faction was usually called the Black-and-tan faction. William F. Butler of Jefferson County, Kentucky spoke at the first convention of the Negro Republican Party held in Lexington, Kentucky in November 1867 and became the president of the party. The religious leader Elisha Green was chosen vice-president of the Kentucky branch at the Lexington convention in 1867. He was a leading Baptist preacher in Maysville and Paris until he died in 1889. The Democrats were opposed to the Negro Republicans, which represented the majority of eligible voters in some states. In 1866, The Old Guard magazine accused the Democrats of using force and fraud to gain and retain power, and representing \\"but a despised faction of the American people\\". Many years later, the New Orleans Times-Picayune was hostile to the organization in Louisiana, publishing editorials in the 1890s in favor of disenfranchisement of Negroes on the basis that they were \\"unfit to vote, ignorant, shiftless, depraved and criminal-minded\\", and would be controlled by a \\"ring\\" of white politicians. In September 1895 after a \\"pow-wow\\" of the Negro Republican Party, the Picayune claimed that whites would be willing to accept subordinate positions in the party to control the Negro vote. In his 1920 book \\"Children of the Slaves\\", the British author Stephen Graham mentions that in New Orleans the Negro Republican Party could not count for much in votes. African American males were allowed to vote in Alabama until 1901, when the state disenfranchised them although still letting them register. The Negro Republican Party in Birmingham, Alabama was organized in opposition to the lily-white Republican party, after that party prevented any of the twenty-five black delegates from taking part in its Birmingham convention. In Maryland, while the Democrats were typically against allowing blacks to vote at all, the Republicans wanted to give them this and other basic rights, but many did not want blacks to hold important political offices or to have frequent contact with whites. Their vote was important to the Republicans though. In 1909, at a time when the Democrats were pushing for disenfranchisement in the state, the Republicans called on all members of the Negro Republican Party to turn out on voting day in every district.

In 1996, the first outpatient clinic was opened in Antipolo, Rizal. The main hospital moved to its current location in Ortigas in 2004. The TMC launched the Center for Patient Partnership, its flagship patient partnership program in 2007. TMC began aggressively expanding its presence by acquiring hospitals and clinics outside Metro Manila and in the Visayas and Mindanao as well in the early 2010s. A boardroom coup happened in September 2018, which led to CEO Alfredo Bengzon losing control of TMC. His nephew Jose Xavier Gonzales was elected as Chairperson and Eugenio Ramos was elected as CEO in a special stockholders meeting. The move was legally challenged by Bengzon with the Gonzales-Ramos side insisting Bengzon's tenure has expired and that he has less than 1 percent stakes in the company. Another election was held electing Gonzales and Ramos to the TMC's board During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines, the TMC has accommodated patients at its main hospital in Ortigas. By April 2020, the hospital is already among the COVID-19 testing centers in the country and the TMC has entered partnership with the local governments of Pasig and Valenzuela; with the former to convert the Pasig City Children's Hospital to a COVID-19 dedicated facility and with the latter for their mass testing efforts.

The 18 floors of the Medical Arts Tower house 280 doctors' clinics and select commercial spaces, while located within the six-floor Podium are diagnostic and intervention facilities, as well as support and administrative offices. The hospital also has a three-level basement parking accommodation for over a thousand vehicles. The complex is also equipped with a broad range of security features, an advanced building management system, and biosafety features incorporated into sensitive patient areas. TMC also serves as the hub for a network of satellite clinics and hospitals that delivers a range of diagnostic and therapeutic services to patients in Manila and select provinces.

Service history Initially on service with the North America and West Indies Station, she commenced service on the Australia Station in November 1894. From 30 May to 10 August 1896, she toured through the Solomon Islands with Charles Morris Woodford, who had been appointed the Resident Commissioner of the Solomon Islands, which was administered as part of British Western Pacific Territories.

Soon after the building of ships with iron was commenced, this composite system of construction was adopted in the British merchant service, and some very fast and celebrated vessels were thus constructed. The iron framing, with wooden skin planking, admitted of considerable strength being obtained, and the possibility of sheathing the bottom with metal in order to avoid fouling, appeared to be another advantage in favor of the composite system. Soon, however, it was shown that the galvanic action set up between the copper on the \\"yellow metal\\" sheathing, and the iron frames tended to rapidly deteriorate the ironwork, and perhaps, sooner or later, hasten the loss of the vessel. So rapid, indeed, was this wasting of the frame found to be, that for some time past the composite system has been, so far as regards merchantmen, quite abandoned. Some ships, however, are still built \\"composite\\" for the Royal Navy, especially such craft as are intended for use on foreign stations, and whose duties would render frequent docking impossible. Such vessels are built with frames of steel, then sheathed with wood, and coppered.

For the 2013 election, Greater Dunedin candidates included Dave Cull, Jinty MacTavish, Richard Thomson, Mike Lord, Irene Mosley, Kate Wilson, Chris Staynes, Letisha Nicholas and Ali Copeman. Cull was undecided whether or not Carisbrook should be kept as a future sporting venue, but the stadium has since be demolished. On 26 February 2016, Mayor Cull announced the dissolution of the Greater Dunedin group and that he and the other members would be contesting the upcoming local body elections in October 2016 as independent candidates. Cull's assertion that the dissolution was not caused by any \\"split within the ranks\\" was contested by fellow councillor Mike Lord, who disagreed with the Dunedin City Council's ethical investment policy and other unspecified issues. However, he praised the Greater Dunedin group for focusing on council efficiency and debt reduction. Meanwhile, councillor Kate Wilson credited the group with bringing more new councillors into the city council. The dissolution also coincided with a news report that the Labour Party would be contesting the Dunedin local body elections under the \\"Local Labour\\" ticket. On 20 April, it was reported that the Labour Party had dropped its plan to field a bloc of candidates in the 2016 Dunedin elections but would still consider endorsing other candidates. Mayor Cull has confirmed that he would also contest the 2016 mayoralty. Policies * Fiscal responsibility * Environmentally friendly * Economic development * Reduce compliance costs * Preserving heritage infrastructure Dave Cull voted against the construction of the new Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza as did Wilson with Staynes supporting it. Since then all three councilors have objected to the stadium.

Premiere Mithun Chakraborty at the premiere of Skukno Lanka Shukno Lanka is the story of a Junior artist living in a tinsel town, played by Mithun Chakraborty, who is yet to taste success after a struggle of 30 years of acting career. Sabyasachi Chakrabarty plays the character of Joy Sundar Sen, who is inspired by Ritwik Ghatak casts junior artiste Chinu Nandi a chance in the lead role in his next venture. The film motivates thousands of junior artistes, when the character played by Mithun gets signed for an international project as the leading man. The film has allusions to the works of Ritwik Ghatak and Satyajit Ray, and even the character played by Sabyasachi Chakrabarty has apparent similarities with Ray.  Plot  Chinu Nandi (Mithun Chakraborty) was a talented part-time actor and full-time employee of a coal- mine. Once he loses his job, he takes up acting as his full-time job. However, not starting in the profession early proves to be his demerit. He finds himself as a 250 bucks per day actor, who gets paid only if he gets a chance to play some part on the day. He is cast mainly as elderly house-servants and similar small characters in thoroughly commercial movies. Even so, he tries to give his best in such roles, which makes the stars of such movies (mainly Tublai, played by late Kunal Mitra) insecure, and they start to avoid giving him roles. Meanwhile, Joy Sundar Sen (Sabyasachi Chakrabarty), a world- renowned director who recently won an award for his movie at the Berlin Film Festival, starts working on his new project: a movie based on Ritwik Ghatak's short story Porosh Pathor (The Philosopher's Stone). In order to portray the protagonist of this movie (Chandrakant), Sen selects Chinu Nandi, much to the dismay of the superstars of the industry, some of whom are openly hostile with Nandi for being 'the chosen one'. Through the course of filming this movie, we see a lot of these two characters, their sincerity, their devotion to their fields, their love for art, and their talent. When it comes to family, however, Nandi is very happy being a poor simpleton with his wife (Angana Bose), whom he loves very dearly, and cherishes his hobby of cuisine. Sen, on the contrary, is indifferent to his wife (Debashree Roy), who constantly tries to make him feel her presence through her love for him. The movie, after a couple of obstacles, finally gets released, and everything falls into place. Sen and his wife revive their love for each other, and Nandi wins the respect of his wife and the whole neighbourhood.

The principal element of the Bowden cable is a flexible tube containing a length of fine wire rope that could slide within the tube, directly transmitting pulling, pushing or turning movements on the wire rope from one end to the other without the need of pulleys or flexible joints. The cable was particularly intended for use in conjunction with bicycle brakes. The Bowden Brake was launched amidst a flurry of enthusiasm in the cycle press. Sir Frank Bowden, the founder and owner of the Raleigh Bicycle Company, was reputed to have started replacing the rigid rods used for bicycle brakes with a flexible wound cable around 1902. This may be the reason the invention of the Bowden cable has been popularly attributed to him. In any case, the origin and invention of the Bowden cable is open to some dispute, confusion and popular myth.

A former Iceland under-21 international, he has since switched allegiance to the Philippines, making his debut in 2010. He plays mainly as a left back but has also played as a winger and even as a forward early in his career.  Club career  He signed a new three-year contract for Grindavik in March 2010. He has played in 146 Úrvalsdeild matches as of September 2010, and also in some domestic and European Cup matches. In 2015, Ray Anthony played for Global FC of the United Football League in the Philippines and later returned to Iceland to serve as a playing coach for Grindavik. = International career = His father is Icelandic and his mother is a Filipina making him eligible to represent either country at international level. In 2001, he played two games with the Icelandic under-21 team, but since he has not played for the senior national team, he is eligible to play for the Philippines. This is after FIFA removed the age limit on players changing national teams in June 2009. In September 2010 he was called up to play for the Philippines national team in the 2010 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification. Ray Anthony was initially planning on going to Asia on holiday but was tipped about possibly trying out for the Philippines national team. He eventually got in touch with the people involved with the national team and he was able to join the team in time for the 2010 Long Teng Cup. He then made his full international debut in their final match against Macau on 12 October 2010, playing the full 90 minutes in a 5-0 win. During the Suzuki Cup qualifiers, he played in all three matches and was instrumental in keeping two clean sheets against Timor-Leste and Cambodia. This helped the Philippines stay undefeated with one win and two draws and clinch qualification for the 2010 AFF Suzuki Cup. His good form would continue at the Suzuki Cup with the Philippines conceding only a single goal in the group stage, in the 1-1 draw with Singapore. Thus, the Philippines qualified for the knockout stage of the tournament for the first time ever. They faced Indonesia in the semi-finals and in the first-leg, the Philippines lost 1-0 with the goal coming from a mix up between Ray Anthony and goalkeeper Neil Etheridge. The Philippines eventually lost 2-0 on aggregate.

Mirza Teletović led the Spanish team with 24 points and 9 rebounds, Fernando San Emeterio scored 15 points and Marcelinho Huertas had an all-around performance with 7 points, 5 rebounds and 11 assists. The Thunder played the same day against CSKA in Oklahoma City, winning 97–89. Kevin Durant had 20 points, 5 rebounds and 7 assists for the winners, and Šiškauskas scored 17 for CSKA. The last day of the tour was a history-changing one, as CSKA beat the Cavaliers to become the first international team ever to defeat an NBA franchise on US soil. In a game where both teams played without several key players (Khryapa and Holden for CSKA, Varejão, Parker, Jamison and Williams for the Cavs), the 2008 Euroleague MVP Ramūnas Šiškauskas made the difference by scoring 22 points and grabbing 5 rebounds. Jamont Gordon also was excellent with 19 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists, whereas Trajan Langdon's 14 points were more than crucial. Cleveland gave a strong fight mainly through Daniel Gibson who scored 21 points, Ryan Hollins who had 17 and Ramon Sessions with 14. In the other game of the night Caja Laboral was unable to threaten the Spurs in San Antonio losing 108–85. Tony Parker led the winners with 22 points, while David Logan and Mirza Teletović scored 20 and 18 respectively.

Aiki means the defender blends without clashing with the attacker, then goes on to dominate the assailant through the application of internal strength or Ki energy to effect techniques. Blending with an attacker's movements allows the Aiki practitioner to control the actions of the attacker with minimal effort. Hanmi describes the idea that the sides of the body work as a unit (for example: left hand and left foot forward). Usually, though not exclusively, descriptive of the movement in Aikido. Closely related to the development of Chushin-ryoku. Often used to refer to the triangular stance (kamae) of Aikido. Similar stances and the same word are used in other martial arts and traditional theater, including sumo and kyōgen.  Chūshin-ryoku  .  Chūshin-sen  . The term is also associated with kendo. Ichi-go ichi-e describes a cultural concept often linked with tea master Sen no Rikyū. The term is often translated as \\"for this time only\\", \\"never again\\", or \\"one chance in a lifetime\\". Ichi-go ichi-e is linked with Zen Buddhism and concepts of transience. The term is particularly associated with the Japanese tea ceremony, and is often brushed onto scrolls which are hung in the tea room. In the context of tea ceremony, ichi-go ichi-e reminds participants that each tea meeting is unique. Irimi describes entering straight into a technique, as opposed to the more indirect entrance into technique called tenkan. Irimi usually looks like a step forward, straight or at an angle but usually ending with the body facing the attacker, rather than in the direction of the step. To enter with irimi, the defender needs to move in the very moment of the attack or even himself initiate it. Katsu hayabi  is a highly developed state in which an aikido practitioner has reached spiritual and moral perfection, and becomes immune to violence. \\"Victory\\" occurs at the speed of light -- meaning instantaneous—because an opponent cannot even begin an attack. Kokyū-Ryoku Is the concept of relaxed power generated from the tanden. There is an implication in the word kokyū that this type of power does not clash with uke.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJouu8ahM7I  Kuzushi is the Japanese term for unbalancing an opponent in the martial arts. The noun comes from the intransitive verb, kuzusu, meaning to level, pull down, or demolish. As such, it refers to not just an unbalancing, but the process of getting an opponent into a position where his stability, and hence ability to regain compromised balance, is destroyed. Maai refers to the space between two opponents in combat. It is a complex concept, incorporating not just the distance between opponents, but also the time it will take to cross the distance, angle and rhythm of attack. It is specifically the exact position from which one opponent can strike the other, after factoring in the above elements. For example, a faster opponent's maai is farther away than a slower opponent. It is ideal for one opponent to maintain maai while preventing the other from doing so. Masakatsu agatsu is a 4 character compound expressing a concept in Japanese martial arts, particularly aikido, referring to the true victory of self-mastery. It was a common saying of aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba which emphasizes that aikido is not a competitive martial art like judo or taekwondo. Shinmu fusatsu states that in aikido one should not kill the opponent. It is related to the kenjutsu concepts of satsuninto (殺人刀 the sword that takes life; also satsujinken 殺人剣) and katsujinken (活人剣 the sword that gives life). Taisabaki relates to 'whole body movement', or repositioning. It can be translated as body-management. It is a term used widely in kendo, jujutsu, aikido, judo, karate and ninjutsu. Tai sabaki is usually used to avoid an attack, such that the receiver of the attack ends up in an advantageous position and it is often wrongly referred to as \\"evasion.\\"  Takemusu was the concept developed by Morihei Ueshiba of how the ultimate martial art should be, how his aikido should be, an art which may harmonize all living beings and free techniques could be spontaneously executed. In his latest years, Ueshiba developed the more spiritual aspects of his art and even adopted the name Takemusu Tsunemori, under which he left many paintings and poems. Tenkan is a 180-degree pivot to one's rear, on the lead foot.  Zanshin refers to a state of awareness – of relaxed alertness. The literal translation of zanshin is \\"remaining mind\\". Zanshin sometimes refers more narrowly to the body's posture after a technique is executed.  Yamabiko The concept of calling out the attack rather than waiting for the attacker. The term presumably comes from a poem by the founder. http://shoshin.over- blog.com/article-yamabiko-no-michi-90247157.html It is loosely related to the concept of or of inviting the attack.

Process and goals NELL was programmed by its developers to be able to identify a basic set of fundamental semantic relationships between a few hundred predefined categories of data, such as cities, companies, emotions and sports teams. Since the beginning of 2010, the Carnegie Mellon research team has been running NELL around the clock, sifting through hundreds of millions of web pages looking for connections between the information it already knows and what it finds through its search process - to make new connections in a manner that is intended to mimic the way humans learn new information.Project Overview, Carnegie Mellon University.

For example, in encountering the word pair \\"Pikes Peak\\", NELL would notice that both words are capitalized and deduce from the second word that it was the name of a mountain, and then build on the relationship of words surrounding those two words to deduce other connections. The goal of NELL and other semantic learning systems, such as IBM's Watson system, is to be able to develop means of answering questions posed by users in natural language with no human intervention in the process.Trader, Tiffany. \\"Machine Learns Language Starting with the Facts\\", HPCwire, October 5, 2010.

He collaborated with painter Constantin Hansen (1804–1880). Early life and career Hilker was born to navigator Christian Hilker and Marie Margrethe (née Vest) and Christian Hilker, a shipmaster who later served as a customs officer. At the age of 13, he enrolled at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. After first training in landscape painting and winning two silver medals at the model school, Hilker turned to decorative painting. While still a student, he participated in decorating the residence of Hermann Ernst Freund (1786–1840), an Academy professor of sculpture, in the former Supply Building on Slotsholmen. This project introduced him to the Pompeian Styles which would characterize much of his later work. He also worked on other notable projects, including the decoration of Christiansborg and Amalienborg Palaces. Italy, 1838-41 Hilker was awarded support from the Fonden ad usus publicos. He traveled to Rome traveled with the painter Christen Købke who had received a travel stipend from the Royal Academy. This gave him the opportunity to study Pompeian art and Raphael's works at the Vatican. The following summer, he also went to Naples, Pompeii and Capri where he lived and worked with Christen Købke and fellow Danish painters Constantin Hansen and Jørgen Roed. The vestibule in the main building of University of Copenhagen, with frescos by Hilker and Constantin Hansen Back in Denmark Back in Denmark in 1841, Hilker's career was launched when he received an important commission from architect Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll (1800–1856) to decorate rooms in Thorvaldsens Museum. Hilker commenced a collaboration with Constantin Hansen. One of their most important assignments was the decoration of the vestibule of the new main building for the University of Copenhagen from 1844 to 1853. In 1847, Hilker married Elise Boline Schou (1820-1867). In 1848-49, he taught at the Copenhagen Technical College, and starting in 1853, he taught the Art Academy's decoration class. He was commissioned to decorate Festsalen at the Herlufsholm School (Herlufsholm Skole) at Næstved (1869-70), the Agricultural College at the Sorø Academy (1860-63), and the university's Festsal (1862-65), where he employed a rich neo-Renaissance style. Other commissions were Copenhagen's new bank building (1869) and various private properties in Copenhagen as well as in the province. These projects displayed antique motifs either directly or in the modified Neo-Renaissance form and frequently involved collaborations with other artists, especially Constantin Hansen. Hilker's wife died in 1867. Shortly before his own death in 1875, he was appointed a knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. He was buried at the Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen).

Early life Dmitryeva was born in the village of Voronino, in the Saratov Governorate of the Russian Empire, where her father was a serf. He had been sent to an agricultural school by his master and was subsequently made the overseer of his master's estate. Her mother, Anna passed on her love of literature to Dmitryeva. After the Emancipation reform of 1861 the family was reduced to poverty and a transient existence. As a girl, Dmitryeva read everything she could find, from borrowed books to discarded newspapers. She kept a diary, using scraps of paper and old envelopes. She maintained the diary from the age of 10 to 23, when it was confiscated in a police search. The family eventually went to live in the household of Dmitryeva's maternal grandfather. As a teenage girl in her grandfather's home, she was confined to the traditional role of girls in Russian society of the time, limiting her to household tasks such as sewing and cooking, while her brother was sent to study with the son of a rich landowner. She was able to study secretly using books given to her by her brother's tutor. In 1873 she was admitted to the Tambov Girl's Secondary School. She worked her way through school by doing tutoring jobs, and with the help of one of her teachers. She graduated in 1877. By the time of her graduation she had become radicalized, and was writing reviews of works by leading critical thinkers like Nikolay Mikhaylovsky, Gleb Uspensky and Nikolay Dobrolyubov for her reading and discussion group in Tambov. Career After graduating she took a job as a teacher in a village school, one of the few positions open to women, and published articles in the press about the poor state of public education. She was dismissed from her post after writing a critical letter to the authorities, and prohibited from teaching. Unable to teach, she decided to pursue a medical career. She entered the Women's Medical Courses in Saint Petersburg in 1878. This program owed its existence to the influence of the Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin, who was an advocate of medical education for women. Dmitryeva spent almost as much time aiding revolutionary activists as she did on her studies, allowing her room to be used for storing illegal literature and as a safe house for wanted revolutionaries. Her connections, which included members of Narodnaya Volya, led to her arrest in 1880, and a short term of imprisonment in the Peter and Paul Fortress. After the arrest and disappearance of most of her friends in the early 1880s, and finding herself in difficult financial circumstances, she turned increasingly to writing. She graduated from the Medical Courses in 1886, and studied obstetrics and gynaecology in Moscow until 1887. Dmitryeva in the 1890s. In 1887 she was arrested and imprisoned for participating in student demonstrations, and was later exiled to Tver for four years with her sister, where she was under police surveillance. In 1892 she moved to Voronezh with her husband, who had also served time in confinement for revolutionary activities. She found work as a doctor during outbreaks of cholera (1892–1893), and diphtheria, typhus and scarlet fever in 1894. During her time treating these epidemics, she stood up to local authorities, demanding a decent salary, badly needed equipment and sober staff, which had been denied to her and other women doctors. Dmitryeva became a full-time writer in 1895. She and her husband lived in Voronezh until 1917, while making occasional trips to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Europe. During the Russian Civil War she fled to Sochi after losing her mother and 3 brothers to cold and starvation. She nearly died of starvation herself, and lost her husband who died after being imprisoned by the Bolsheviks. During the Soviet period she devoted her time to the cause of literacy, and to writing memoirs and children's stories. She died in Sochi in 1947. Literary work Dmitryeva made her literary debut in 1877 as a writer of peasant stories at a time when educated Russians were eager to learn about peasants and rural life. Her first story To Seek Justice appeared in a newspaper in Saratov. Her story Akhmetka's Wife (1881) attracted favorable attention from critics and praise from Nadezhda Khvoshchinskaya, an established woman writer. Dmitryeva's works treated a wide variety of settings and characters. Besides rural Russia, her stories cover Ukraine, the Crimea and the Caucasus. In the course of her literary career she met Maxim Gorky, Leonid Andreyev, Vikenty Veresayev, and other well-known writers. Her works were published in the journals Russian Thought, The Herald of Europe and Russian Wealth. Her most popular work was the children's story A Boy and His Dog (1899) which went through more than twenty editions. She wrote an autobiography published in 1901; an expanded edition, titled Tak bylo (The Way It Was), was published in 1930.

The first system, EEC I, used processors and components developed by Toshiba in 1973. It began production in 1974, and went into mass production in 1975. It subsequently went through several model iterations.  EEC I and II  These two \\"modules\\" used a common processor and memory so they can be described together. The microprocessor was a 12-bit central processing unit manufactured by Toshiba, the TLCS-12, which began development in 1971 and was completed in 1973. It was a 32mm² chip with about 2,800 silicon gates, manufactured on a 6 µm process. The system's semiconductor memory included 512-bit RAM, 2kb ROM and 2kb EPROM. The system began production in 1974, and went into mass production in 1975. Ford's internal code name for the TLCS-12 microprocessor was \\"PM-11\\" or \\"Poor Man's 11\\" implying it was a stripped down version of the, then popular, Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computer. A PDP-11 was used in a vehicle in the first half of the 1970s for \\"proof of concept\\". In reality, there was very little in common between these two computer architectures. This chip was never commercially available. This 12 bit processor was the only commercially available chip to feature all four mathematical functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) at the time. The choice of 12 bits was not accidental. For accuracy, it was determined that formulas needed to be able to resolve 1 part in 1000 or about 10 bits. Another bit was required for sign. This, logically, was rounded up to 12 bits which also resulted in an address space of 16 kilo-words. There was no \\"stack\\" for subroutine calls and returns. Rather the Instruction Pointer Register was \\"swapped\\" with another register that had been previously filled with the address of the target subroutine. Returning was accomplished by swapping back. All code was written in assembly language. Another feature on the EEC I/II modules was the use of a separate memory module that bolted to the housing of the control module. This was done to facilitate changing the software, a combination of algorithms (\\"strategy\\") and data (\\"calibration\\") in the field, if necessary. The memory module used \\"Masked ROM\\" (MROM), a type of memory chip that was not modifiable after manufacture. The memory module also featured some switches that could be changed in the field. The strategy would read these switches and retard the spark advance for vehicles experiencing pre-ignition (knock). The processor module featured a 10 volt reference for its analog-to-digital converter which was used to gather data from various sensors. This could have been an issue as the available power to the module varied above and below 10 volts during engine cranking. The problem was solved by several steps. First, all sensors used a ratiometric measuring method that ensured accuracy in spite of varying reference voltage. Second, during cranking, a special circuit triggered the ignition system in synchronization with the reference pulses from the engine. Third, the processor was not allowed to start until the internal voltage was stabilized above 10 volts. The EEC-II controlled air-fuel ratio via the Ford proprietary model 7200 Variable Venturi (VV) Carburetor. This was the last carburetor designed and built by Ford US. It was considered to be the pinnacle of carburetor design. Air-fuel ratio was controlled by a stepper motor that operated a rack which moved a pintle that opened and closed the float bowl vent. When closed, no air could enter the bowl, causing the fuel mixture to be lean. When open, the fuel mixture was rich. While this carburetor worked well, it was extremely expensive to manufacture. Each carburetor was hand-calibrated in a pressure controlled room. Although there was much in common \\"inside the box\\", the size, shape and main connector were different between EEC I and II. The processor design was significantly upgraded as a candidate for use in EEC-III but was not chosen.  EEC-III  This system is used on certain 1981-83 models. There were two different EEC-III modules: Feedback Carburetor (FBC) and Central Fuel Injection (CFI; similar to GM's Throttle Body Injection). The module size and shape were approximately the same as the EEC-II and still utilized the external memory module. The two modules had differently keyed connectors to prevent accidental insertion in the wrong vehicle. EEC-III uses a Duraspark III module (brown grommet where wires emerge) and a Duraspark II ignition coil. A resistance wire is used in the primary circuit. The distributors in EEC-III (and later) systems eliminate conventional mechanical and vacuum advance mechanisms. All timing is controlled by the engine computer, which is capable of firing the spark plug at any point within a 50-degree range depending on calibration. This increased spark capability requires greater separation of adjacent distributor cap electrodes to prevent cross-fire, resulting in a large-diameter distributor cap. The FBC module controlled the same Ford 7200 VV carburetor as the EEC-II. The CFI module fired two high pressure (approximately 40 psi) fuel injectors that were mounted in a throttle body attached to a traditional intake manifold in the center valley of the 5.0 liter (302 cid) engine. CFI was available on all Ford vehicles with the 5.0 l engine. The processor was designed and manufactured by Motorola (now Freescale). It featured an 8-bit data length, a 10-bit instruction length and a 13-bit address length. The address space was \\"paged\\", meaning you could not directly address all of the address space without special instructions. There were 4 pages. Page 0 was for normal (background) code. Page 1 was for interrupt code. Page 2 was also for background, but could only be accessed by a special \\"Jump Page\\" instruction from page 0. Page 3 was used to store parametric (\\"calibration\\") data or additional interrupt level code. This chip was never sold commercially. Like EEC-I and -II, all code was written in assembly language. While the processor chips were manufactured by Motorola, the modules were designed and assembled by either Motorola, Toshiba or Ford. The designs were functionally equivalent but slightly different components were used. Motorola optimized their design to use as many of their own components as possible.  EEC-IV  Preliminary design work in EEC-IV started even before EEC-III was in production. Over time, there were many different modules designed around this processor. It is likely that more Ford vehicles were produced using Engine/Powertrain Control Modules (ECM/PCM) based on variations of this design than any other module that Ford has ever used. Unlike previous EEC systems, EEC-IV uses a small ignition module called the TFI or TFI-IV (Thick Film Integrated Ignition) module. It is usually grey in color and was originally mounted on the distributor. Later models have the TFI module mounted on a heatsink in the engine compartment. It is prone to damage from heat. Replacement TFI modules are sold with a small packet of heat transfer compound which should be applied to the back of the module. It was created with surface-mount technology parts, allowing it to be much smaller than the previous Dura-Spark ignition module. The ignition coil used is the E-Core design. This ignition coil design is more efficient than the older- style cylinder-shaped ignition coils. The EEC-IV system has more diagnostic capabilities than previous EEC systems. Early EEC-IV equipped cars don't have the capability to send sensor data through the diagnostic connector to a scan tool. However, there are KOEO (Key On, Engine Off) and KOER (Key On, Engine Running) self-tests, and a Continuous Monitor (wiggle) test, a feature to help test the wiring connections to various sensors/actuators by wiggling the wires of the component in question. By the early 1990s certain Ford/Lincoln/Mercury models had sensor data streaming capability. The feature is called DCL (Data Communications Link). These models have 2 additional data bus wires to the EEC-IV diagnostic connector). The EEC-IV computer was built around an Intel- designed 8/16 bit processor called the 8061. This chip was never sold commercially, but a close variation, the 8096, was extremely popular. The major difference between these two chips was the external instruction/data bus. Ford wanted to minimize the number of pins used for input and output so Intel designed a unique bus (MBUS) that multiplexed address and data onto an 8 bit bus. Several additional control lines were used for transferring information on this bus. Because of the unique nature of the bus, custom memory chips were required. EEC-IV first appeared on the 1983 1.6L EFI, 2.3L High Swirl Combustion (HSC), 2.3L EFI Turbo and 2.8L truck engines. With the Escort, the base engine was the same as all US Escorts, the 1.6L CVH, but featured unique intake and exhaust manifolds in addition to EFI. This was non- sequential EFI, meaning 1/4 of the required fuel for each cylinder was injected into the intake manifold, near the intake valve for each cylinder firing. The first EEC-IV module was unique from future modules in many ways. It had a unique \\"edge card\\" connector. This was a \\"cost savings\\" over the EEC I/II/II \\"pin and socket\\" connectors but was quickly abandoned due to reliability concerns. It utilized a 40 pin \\"DIP\\" IC package which limited the number of inputs/outputs. It also used only 1 memory chips which contained 8K bytes of MROM instructions/data and 128 addition bytes of RAM. All future EEC- IV modules used a unique \\"through hole\\" IC package with staggered pins on all 4 edges. This allowed all available I/O to be utilized. Memory quickly grew to 2 - 8k/128 MROM/RAM chips and then a separate 32K MROM and 1K RAM. Bus loading limited the design to 2 external memory devices. Intel only manufactured chips, not modules. Eventually there was a unique MBUS UVEPROM designed and manufactured by Intel. Motorola and Ford Electronics Division (precursor to Visteon) designed and manufactured the modules. After several years of Intel being the sole supplier of processor chips, Ford persuaded Intel to share the design with Motorola and allow them to produce 8061 chips, but only for consumption by Ford. Over the years, there were many variations of EEC-IV modules depending on the number of engine cylinders and the types and quantities of inputs and outputs. There were even a series of special EEC-IV modules designed for use in Formula 1 race cars, making Ford one of the earliest adopters of digital electronics on a race car. *These EEC-IV were used on the Ford/Cosworth 1.5L turbo Formula 1 engine in 1985.http://papers.sae.org/910253/ This engine with the EEC-IV was used by Haas/FORCE F1 a.k.a. Hass/Lola. This team employed both Ross Brawn and Adrian Newey.http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/con-haas.html  EEC-V  Additional performance needs drove Ford Electronics to develop an enhanced microprocessor named the 8065 building on EEC-IV technology. Memory was expanded from 64K to 1 megabyte, speed tripled, and I/O more than doubled. Additional interrupts and improved time controlled I/O allowed continued use of EEC-IV code and extended the family lifetime to almost 20 years in production.  EEC-V DPC  European Ford Diesel Duratorq engines (all TDDi and TDCi starting with model year 2000) used EEC-V DPC-xxx series, which used variant of Intel i196 microcontroller with 28F200 flash memory. The EEC-V DPC ECUs were later replaced by Delphi, Bosch EDC16, Siemens SID80x/SID20x, or Visteon DCU ECUs.  Visteon Levanta  Visteon Levanta 'Black Oak' PCM is the first ECU that used Freescale PowerPC architecture. The ECU was used in Ford Mondeo, Galaxy, Focus and Ka - 1.8/2.0/2.5/3.0 Duratec HE/I4 engine.  EEC-150  EEC-150 for 3.0/4.0 V6/4.6 SOHC engines uses PowerPC, however compared to Visteon Levanta the ECU is closer to EEC-VI by design.  EEC-VI  EEC-VI is a PowerPC microcontroller used by Ford Motor Company up to 2013 models. Wide ranges of ECU variants exist. EEC-VI use ISO15765 or ISO14229 (UDS) over ISO15765 protocol for diagnostics.  EEC-VII and beyond  EEC-VII Is the latest system with a PowerPC microcontroller used by Ford Motor Company, utilizing mostly the CAN bus and Ford's proprietary MS-CAN architecture.

It occurs when response from a painful stimulus is inhibited by another, often spatially distant, noxious stimulus. Mechanism Noxious stimuli activate the endings of nociceptive C and A delta nerve fibers, which carry the signal to neurons in the dorsal horn of spinal cord. DNIC refers to the mechanism by which dorsal horn wide dynamic range neurons responsive to stimulation from one location of the body may be inhibited by noxious stimuli (such as heat, high pressure or electric stimulation) applied to another, remote location in the body. The inhibition is thought to originate in the brain, and is thought to affect both wide dynamic range and nociception-specific neurons in the dorsal horn. Studies investigating gender differences in DNIC have shown mixed results with the effect dependent upon experimental methodology and measurement method. Measurement method Pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pain tolerance (PTol) parameters are widely used as a measure of DNIC. Equipment such as metal pressure algometer with a rubber top is used to apply pressure to a person's finger or toe. The pressure at which the first sensation of pain is felt is recorded as PPT. The pressure is increased further and noted when the person says the pain is intolerable. This higher value is recorded as PTol. A second noxious stimulus (such as ice water) is then applied to a different part of the body and PPT/PTol measured. DNIC response is defined as an increase in the value of PPT during the second noxious stimulation. Clinical use The DNIC model is used frequently to quantify the central pain sensitization in chronic pain patients. DNIC inefficiency (or lower DNIC) has been implicated as a risk factor for development of chronic pain and pain syndromes. Chronic pain disorders such as temporomandibular disorder and fibromyalgia have been associated with DNIC inefficiency. On the other hand, greater DNIC response is related to less pain, better physical functioning, and better self-rated health. Diabetic neuropathy patients with low DNIC are more likely to benefit from treatment with duloxetine and tapentadol, which are considered to restore altered descending modulation. DNIC forms the basis for the use of counterirritant to reduce pain.

Burcham enhanced the size and prestige of the faculty, increasing the number of full- time law professors by almost 15 percent. He also worked with faculty to establish programs in their core areas of expertise, including the Center for the Study of Law & Genocide, the Civil Justice Program, the Distinguished William J. Landers Lecture on Prosecutorial Ethics, the Fidler Institute on Criminal Justice, the Intellectual Property Special Focus Series, the Journalist Law School and the Sports Law Institute. Burcham also strengthened the law school's financial foundation. He raised money to establish seven new faculty chairs, as well as paying for and completing the Girardi Advocacy Center and its flagship classroom, the Robinson Courtroom. With that accomplished, he instituted a building moratorium to focus on the school's endowment, which more than doubled under his watch. He served as the law school dean until he was named LMU's executive vice president and provost in 2008. As LMU's chief operating officer, Burcham strengthened the university for the long term by overseeing the current $380 million capital fund drive and the city approval process of the university's 20-year Master Plan for future growth. To that end, he reconfigured the university budget during the recent economic downturn, transferring funds from various support functions to ensure that academics remained fully funded. He also charged the chief academic officer with modernizing the core curriculum and academic requirements.

Upon his return, he was elevated to Cardinal on 13 July 1643 by Pope Urban VIII\\"Cesare Cardinal Facchinetti\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved June 24, 2017 and was installed as Cardinal-Priest at the Santi Quattro Coronati basilica. Facchinetti was popular with the other cardinals of the college and there was discussion, according to contemporary John Bargrave,Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) that he might be considered papabile - that is, appropriate for election as pope. This did not eventuate, though he remained popular with the Spanish faction within the college and the French faction had no considerable objection to him. As a result of his popularity, his family members were appointed to various military and administrative positions. His brother, for example, was appointed as commander of the militia by Pope Innocent X during the second War of Castro. In 1671 he was appointed Cardinal-Priest at San Lorenzo in Lucina, in 1672 at Cardinal-Bishop of Palestrina and in 1679 Cardinal-Bishop of Porto e S. Rufina. At the death of Francesco Barberini (10 December 1679) he became Dean of the College of Cardinals and in the consistory of 8 January 1680 Innocent XI appointed him Bishop of Ostia e Velletri, Secretary of the Roman Inquisition and administrator of the Apostolic Chancery, positions he held until his death.

She began her career as a mezzo-soprano at the Opéra-Comique in 1900; ultimately transitioning into the leading soprano repertoire at that theatre in 1912. She performed extensively in the United States from 1914–1917 and was also heard as a guest artist at theatres in the French provinces, Monaco, Portugal, and Switzerland during her career. In 1924 she founded her own opera company in Paris with whom she actively performed up until 1930. During her early career, Bériza was married to the French tenor Lucien Muratore. In 1906-1907, they appeared on several Edison cylinder recordings together where she was billed under the name Magli Muratore. She was also billed under that name on a 1910 Pathé Records recording which also included performances by Albert Vaguet and Henri Albers. She divorced Muratore in 1913 so he could marry the soprano Lina Cavalieri. On the stage she performed mainly under the name Marguerite Bériza, sometimes shortening it to Magli Bériza. However, she was occasionally billed under the surname Dériza and in her latter career as Mme Bériza-Greven, probably after a second marriage. Education and career as a mezzo-soprano Born in France, Bériza was trained at the Conservatoire de Paris. She made her professional opera debut in 1900 at the Opéra-Comique in Paris where she was heard mostly in comprimario roles from the mezzo-soprano repertoire during the early part of her career. She performed the part of Geoffroy in the world premiere of Henri Rabaud's La fille de Roland in 1904. In 1906, she sang the role of Kate Pinkerton in the French premiere of Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly; later taking over the part of Suzuki in successive performances. In 1910, she portrayed the role of Pénélope in the world premiere of Claude Terrasse's Le mariage de Télémaque. Some of the roles that Bériza sang during her early years at the Opéra-Comique were the 2nd Priestess in both Christoph Willibald Gluck's Iphigénie en Aulide and Gluck's Iphigénie en Tauride, Gertrude in Charles Gounod's Roméo et Juliette, The Marquise of Birkenfeld in Gaetano Donizetti's La fille du régiment, and The Muse in Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann. In January 1909 and January 1910 she appeared as a guest artist at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo performing the roles of Erda, Flosshilde, and Waltraute in Richard Wagner's The Ring Cycle. She was also heard there as Stéphano in Roméo et Juliette. Career as a soprano In 1912, Bériza began performing leading soprano roles at the Opéra- Comique. There she had major success in roles like Musetta in Puccini's La bohème, Santuzza in Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, Violetta in Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata, and the title roles in Ambroise Thomas's Mignon and Puccini's Tosca. She also continued to perform roles traditionally sung by mezzo-sopranos like Anita in Jules Massenet's La Navarraise and Mallika in Léo Delibes's Lakmé. She sang leading roles as a guest artist at the Grand Théâtre de Genève, the Opéra de Marseille, the Opéra de Nice, and the Opéra National de Lyon. While still performing occasionally at the Opéra-Comique, Bériza gave numerous performances in the United States during the second decade of the 20th century. In late 1913 she came to the United States for the first time to sing with the Boston Opera Company; making her debut with the company in January 1914 as Musetta to the Mimi of Maggie Teyte.\\"Miss Teyte An Adorable Mimi\\", The Boston Globe, 4 January 1914, pg. 16 She appeared in several more roles with the company that year, including Antonia in The Tales of Hoffmann, Marguerite in Gounod's Faust and the title roles in Gustave Charpentier's Louise and Henry Février's Monna Vanna (replacing Mary Garden in the role).\\"Mme Beriza Succeeds Mary Garden As Monna Vanna With Success\\", The Boston Globe, 1 March 1914, pg. 8 Bériza sang Monna Vanna for her debut with the Chicago Grand Opera Company in 1915. She performed in several operas at Ravinia Park, Illinois (with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra), in July–August 1916, including singing Cio-Cio-San in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, Marguerite, Santuzza, Tosca, and the title role in Georges Bizet's Carmen.\\"'Carmen' Is Sung at Ravinia Park.\\", Chicago Tribune, 25 July 1916, page 14 She returned to Ravinia in the summer of 1917 to sing the French national anthem, Leonora in Verdi's Il trovatore, and, with Orville Harrold, Santuzza and the title role in Massenet's Manon.\\"Final Bills of Ravinia's Season\\", Chicago Tribune, 2 September 1917, page C2 She performed at Ravinia again in 1928.\\"Society Turns Out for Gala Closing of Opera at Ravinia\\", Chicago Tribune, 4 September 1928, pg. 37 In 1917 she toured the United States with the Giuseppe Creatore Grand Opera Company and appeared at the Odeon Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri in the world premiere of Homer Moore's Louis XIV. In 1923, Bériza joined the roster of the Théâtre Fiametta in Paris where she performed in several contemporary stage works. In 1924 she starred in the world premiere of Lord Berners's Le Carrosse du Saint Sacrement at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. She was also heard at that theater in April of that year as Isabelle in the world premiere of Henri Sauguet's Le plumet du colonel. In 1924, Bériza founded her own opera company in Paris in which she starred in many productions throughout the 1920s. In the 1924-1925 season she sang leading roles in her company's presentations of Paul Le Flem's Aucassin et Nicolette, Francesco Malipiero's Les Sept Chansons, Charles Koechlin's Jacob chez Laban, Manuel de Falla's L'Amour sorcier, Georges Migot's La Fête de la bergère, and Gabriel Dupont's La Farce du cuvier at the Trianon-Lyrique in Paris. The company then established its own performance venue, the Theatre Bériza, but occasionally performed at other theatres. With her company she portrayed the title role in the world premiere of Jacques Ibert's Angélique at the Théâtre Fémina in Paris on 28 January 1927. In 1928 her company made the unusual but successful choice of presenting two secular cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach in staged productions: The Peasant Cantata and The Coffee Cantata. One of her last stage appearances was as Polly Peachum in Kurt Weill's The Threepenny Opera in 1930.

It is partly situated at Adamič–Lunder Embankment () and at Pogačar Square (). History The 1895 earthquake destroyed an old monastery with a diocesan college for girls. After the damaged building was removed, Vodnik Square provided a venue for an outdoor market. The present market building, designed by the architect Jože Plečnik, was built between 1940 and 1942 by Matko Curk's company. It originally extended on an area of . The design of the complex reflects Renaissance influences. It was conceived as a two-storey market hall following the curve of the river. On the side overlooking the river the market halls have large semi-circular windows, while the street side is defined by a colonnade.Ljubljana Tourism, retrieved 5 October 2010 In order to provide views of the river, the building is interrupted with two open-columned loggias.Peter Krečič: Plečnik’s Ljubljana, www.plecnik.net, retrieved 6 October 2010 The roof is covered with massive concrete tiles. Plečnik planned to fill the middle gap between the market halls with a monumental covered bridge to connect to the Petkovšek Embankment (), but his design was never built. His plans for a bridge were finally fulfilled in July 2010 when the newly designed Butchers' Bridge was inaugurated. Market Open market at Pogačar Square Fruit stalls at the market The market is open daily except Sundays. It has a flower market at the junction of Pogačar Square and Vodnik Square, a fish market and dried fruit on the lower level of the market hall and bakery, dairy and meat stalls on both levels. The colonnade at the Triple Bridge end provides shelter for stalls selling herbs, spices, and arts and crafts. Legal status From October 2008, the market was provisionally protected by the Slovenian Ministry of Culture under Vasko Simoniti as a cultural monument of national importance. The decree was annulled by his successor Majda Širca in February 2009. In March 2012, the protection at the state level was reenacted by Žiga Turk for one year with the protection of the Vodnik Square Archaeological Site. It has been disputed by the City Municipality of Ljubljana, aiming to build a parking garage under it, since June 2012 at the Slovenian Constitutional Court.

Early life Ginetti was born in Velletri, the son of a labourer. He was sent to Rome at a very young age to be educated and tried to make himself known to a number of cardinals. Eventually he was appointed chamberlain to Pope Paul V. Upon that Pope's death, Maffeo Barberini was elected as Pope Urban VIII and Ginetti became acquainted with Cardinal Francesco Barberini, the new Pope's nephew. Barberini urged his uncle to promote Ginetti and he was made a Referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signatura.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) Thereafter he remained a loyal supporter of the Barberini. Cardinalate On 19 January 1626 he was elevated to cardinal by Pope Urban VIII and installed as Cardinal-Priest at Santa Francesca Romana in 1627. In 1629 he was made Cardinal Vicar (a title he held until his death) and was made Cardinal-Priest at Sant'Angelo in Pescheria in 1634. In 1635 Ginetti was appointed Papal Legate to Austria in an attempt, by the Barberini, to put him forward as an elder statesman.

Papal conclaves In 1644 he was appointed Cardinal-Priest at Sant'Eustachio and participated in the papal conclave of that yearCatholic Hierarchy: Marzio Ginetti which elected Pope Innocent X. Contemporary, John Bargrave, suggested Ginetti considered himself papable; suitable for election to the papacy. But the Barberini would not entertain it and any efforts on Ginetti's part to suggest as much came to naught. He later participated in the conclave of 1655. He was appointed Vice-Dean of the College of Cardinals and held the position during the conclaves of 1667 and 1669–1670. He died 1671 and was buried at the Sant'Andrea della Valle.S.

They had a base camp at the large lake that was later named for him by European-American settlers who took over the territory. In November 1840 the Potowatomi were forced to Indian Territory in Kansas under the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which was being enforced in the former Northwest Territory.  History  Before the Treaty of Chicago in 1821, Baw Beese led a band in this area of Potowatomi Indians estimated at over 150 members. The people had occupied these lands near the large lake (later named for him) for their cultivation of maize, as well as hunting and fishing. Other chiefs of the Baw Beese family lived in surrounding counties in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. Because the treaty assigned this land to the Potowatomi (if Baw Beese knew about the treaty, as he was not a signatory), he initially considered the white settlers as a kind of tenant, but more kept coming. The Potowatomi were said to be hospitable to the whites and helped them survive in their early years in this area.\\"Baw Beese Lake\\", Hillsdale Historical Society In November 1840 Baw Beese and his band were forcibly removed from Michigan to a reservation in Miami County, Kansas by the U.S. Government under authority of the Indian Removal Act signed into law by President Andrew Jackson in 1830. The voluntary Indian emigrations as outlined in the United States Treaty of Fort Meigs of 1817 and the Treaty of Chicago of 1821 with the tribes were made mandatory under the Indian Removal Act and enforced by the US military. As a chief, Baw Beese was reported as holding to a strict code of justice. His status did not prevent, nor did he try to intervene when his daughter Winona was executed by one of her husband's family, after she had killed Neganska in anger for selling her pony.Fuller, George Newman and Beeson, Lewis,Michigan History, Vol. 6 Lansing: Michigan State Historical Society, 1922. p. 582  Legends  The story of Baw Beese and Winona has developed into local legend. In some versions, the chief must execute his own child because she killed her husband. In some versions, the young woman's skeleton is reported as found on the banks of Baw Beese Lake, identified by a cross bearing her name, or other identification.  Death  The chief was said to have moved to Adrian, Michigan in the spring of 1864. He died there on July 12, 1889. But the final days of Baw Beese are disputed. According to another account, he died in exile in the pine forests near Georgian Bay, Canada, after having left the reservation. Other accounts report his being killed in a raid by Sioux, or having a natural death at a very old age on the Kansas reservation, where the Potowatomi were finally required to settle.  Treaties  The Treaty of Detroit required the cession by natives of the olive-green region above Toledo. By the Fort Meigs Treaty, Native Americans ceded the small pink square on the Indiana-Ohio-Michigan border. The 1821 Treaty of Chicago required them to cede the L-shaped grey area north of Indiana. Baw Beese never signed a treaty with the United States, although he did abide by the Treaty of Detroit of 1807. The line between present-day Lenawee and Hillsdale counties was established as the boundary between the settlers and natives. Because of that treaty, he welcomed the white settlers to Hillsdale County but treated them as tenants. The 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs detailed the cession by the Potowatomi of the southern half of Hillsdale County, including the primary gathering sites of the Baw Beese family at Bird Lake and Squawfield; however, Baw Beese does not appear to have participated in this treaty. Neither did any of the other chiefs with whom Baw Beese associated. The closest name to Baw Beese on a US treaty with the Potawatomi is \\"Paw-pee\\", on an 1834 document.Lake Max-ee- nie-kue-kee But there is little reason to believe this is Baw Beese. He was often associated with the chiefs Me-te-au, Ne-au-to-beer-shaw called \\"Leather Nose\\", and Wap-ka-zeek, none of whom is listed on this document.Dodge, Mrs Frank P., \\"Landmarks of Lenawee County\\", Michigan Pioneer and Historical Collections, Vol. 38, Lansing: Pioneer Society of Michigan, 1912. p488.

In the United States and Canada, it refers to the incorporation of one polity by another, usually adjacent and larger, and usually by vote of the residents involved. For example, in 1872 the city Zanesville, Ohio, annexed the adjacent community of Putnam, and in 1889, the city of Toronto annexed the adjacent town of Parkdale. Within areas that are subdivided noncontiguously, annexation can take place whereby a lower-tier municipality can annex territory under the jurisdiction of a higher-tier municipality, or tiers do not exist a local municipality can annex territory from another local municipality. The rules that govern municipal annexations in absorbation of neighbouring territory vary by country. For example, in the United States, incorporated cities and towns often expand their boundaries by annexing unincorporated land adjacent to them. Municipalities can also entirely annex and be entirely annexed by other municipalities, though this is less common in the United States. Laws governing the ability and the extent municipalities can expand in this fashion are defined by the individual states' constitutions. Annexation of neighbouring communities occurs in Canada.

The Naval Wireless Transmitting Station Coonawarra, which operated under the command of Melville, provided essential communications in support of the Allied operations in the Dutch East Indies and South West Pacific Area regions. The base was subjected to numerous bombing raids during the Battle of Darwin and suffered significant damage. After the cessation of hostilities, the base was hampered by the continuing expansion of Darwin and the increase in numbers of naval personnel.

This Chinese exonym is written with xian 獫 or 玁 \\"long-snouted dog\\", and this \\"dog\\" radical 犭 is commonly used in graphic pejorative characters. Scholars identify the Xianyun with the Quanrong and Xiongnu.Li, Feng (2006). Landscape And Power In Early China. Cambridge University Press. Pages 343-346. Overview The earliest record of the Xianyun is dated to the reign of King Xuan of Zhou (827/25–782 BC). The Book of Songs contains four songs about military actions between the Zhou and the Xianyun. The song \\"Gathering sow thistle\\" (Cai qi) mentions 3,000 Zhou chariots in battle against the Xianyun. The song \\"Sixth month\\" (Liu yue) says that the battlefield was between the lower courses of the Jing (泾河) and Luo rivers and the Wei valley, very close to the center of the Zhou state.Nicola Di Cosmo, The Northern Frontier in Pre-Imperial China//The Cambridge History of Ancient China, p. 920 Written records place the first incursions against Zhou under the name Xirong \\"Western Rong\\" in 843 BC. In 840 BC, the fourteenth year of reign of King Li of Zhou, the Xianyun reached the Zhou capital Haojing. Apparently, the \\"Western Rong\\" and Xianyun were the same people here, named in the first case by a generic term meaning \\"warlike tribes of the west\\" and in the second case by their actual ethnonym. The Xianyun attacked again in 823 BC, the fifth year of reign of King Xuan. Their military tactics characterized by sudden attacks could only have been carried out by highly mobile troops, most likely on horseback. Some scholars relate the appearance of the Xianyun to the appearance of Scythians and Cimmerians migrating from the west, although there is no definite evidence that they were nomadic warriors. A Duo You bronze ding vessel inscription unearthed in 1980 near Xi'an tells that c. 816 BC Xianyun forces attacked a Jing (京) garrison in the lower Ordos region, drawing a Zhou military response. It indicated that like the Zhou, the Xianyun fought on horse-drawn chariots. Contemporary evidence does not indicate that the increased mobility of the Xianyun is related to the emergence of mounted nomads armed with bows and arrows. Later Chinese annals contain a number of references to the Xianyun, such as by Sima Qian (c. 145/135 – 86 BC), Ying Shao (140-206 AD), Wei Zhao (204-273), and Jin Zhuo (late 3rd–4th century AD).Sima Qian, \\"Shiji\\", Bo-na, 1958, Ch. 110, p. 1a Without giving specific arguments, they stated that Xunyu (獯鬻) or Xianyun were terms that designated nomadic people who later during the Han dynasty were transcribed as \\"Xiongnu\\" (匈奴). This view was also held by the Tang dynasty commentator Sima Zhen (c. 8th century).Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of nomadic tribes in China 3rd-5th cc\\", Issue 3 \\"Mujuns\\", \\"Science\\", Moscow, 1992, p. 276, Wang Guowei (1877–1927), as a result of phonetical studies and comparisons based on the inscriptions on bronze and the structure of the characters, came to the conclusion that the tribal names \\"Guifang\\" (鬼方), \\"Xunyu\\" (獯鬻), \\"Xianyu\\" (鮮虞), Xianyun, \\"Rong\\" (戎), \\"Di\\" (狄), and \\"Hu\\" (胡) given in the annals designated one and the same people, who later entered history under the name Xiongnu.Wang Guowei, \\"Guantang Jilin\\" (觀堂集林, Wang Guowei collection of works), Ch.2, Ch. 13in Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of nomadic tribes in China 3rd-5th cc\\", Issue 3 \\"Mujuns\\", p. 276Taskin V.S., 1968, \\"Materials on history of Sünnu\\", \\"Science\\", Moscow, p.10 On the linguistic affiliation of the northern pastoral nomadic tribes with the Xiongnu, the Book of Wei stated at around 554 that: The exact time period when the name \\"Hun\\" had the phonetization \\"Xianyun\\" remains determined only vaguely: Sima Qian stated that in the earlier pre-historic period the Huns were called \\"Hu\\" and \\"Rong\\", in the late pre-historic period they were called \\"Xunyu\\", in the literate period starting with the Yin Dynasty (1600–1046 BC) they were called \\"Guifang\\", in the Zhou period (1045–256 BC) they were called \\"Xianyun\\", starting from the Qin period (221–206 BC) the Chinese annalists called them \\"Xiongnu\\".Sima Qian, \\"Shi Chi\\", Ch. 1, l. 4b, Ch. 110, l. 1a, notesin Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of nomadic tribes in China 3rd–5th cc\\", p.10 References See also * List of past Chinese ethnic groups * Mongols before Genghis Khan Ancient peoples of China Xiongnu ","title":"Xianyun"},{"id":"29066149","text":"Margaret Alayne Elizabeth Davis, née Alexander (born 23 September 1933) is a former Australian politician.

In 1974, Scott was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council, filling a casual vacancy caused by the death of independent MLC John Gardiner. He served until the 1978 state election, when the reduction in the Council's size led him to lose his place on the Coalition's ticket. In the 1988 state election, he was the Liberal candidate for Port Stephens, losing to Labor candidate Bob Martin by 90 votes. Scott took the result to the Court of Disputed Returns, which surprised political observers and politicians by returning a judgement that government cheques handed to community groups by Martin counted as electoral bribery. In the subsequent by-election, Martin resoundingly defeated Scott, who has not returned to politics.

It was built in 1910 to serve the Elgin National Watch Company two blocks to the west. The two-story observatory provided data on time that was scientifically accurate to a tenth of a second. Manufacturers could then produce a more accurate watch. The observatory was an important part of the company's legacy, and they even changed their motto to reflect this. By 1950, the Elgin National Watch Company could no longer compete with wristwatch companies. The observatory was donated to a local school district and became known as the School District U-46 Planetarium/Observatory. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History Elgin was first settled in 1834. In 1850, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad connected to the city, bolstering the economy. Fourteen years later, two employees at the American Watch Company decided to build their own watch factory with Chicago watchmaker John C. Adams. The National Watch Company was incorporated on August 18, 1864 with $100,000 in capital. Former Chicago mayor Benjamin Wright Raymond suggested Elgin as a location for the factory. The first watch model, named after Raymond, first reached retailers on April 1, 1867. Watches were a burgeoning industry, as the American industrial age demanded efficient timing. The watches were an instant success, and became so synonymous with its hometown that the company re-branded itself the Elgin National Watch Company in 1874. By 1907, the company sold over 600,000 watches—almost one-third of the market share—and employed 3,200 people.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201153.pdf Prior to the creation of time zones, cities had substantial differences in the standards of time—in Wisconsin alone, over thirty-eight times were used at a given moment. In 1908, Theodore Roosevelt finally demanded that the United States Bureau of Standards encourage precise timing across the nation. In 1910, the Elgin National Watch Company decided to respond by building its own observatory so that the timing in its watches would be scientifically accurate. Dr. William W. Payne of the Goodsell Observatory was named the first director. Sidereal time was determined on Riefler Clock No. 220 by measuring the position of the stars in the night sky based on the position of the telescope (which could only move north-south along a meridian line). Eleven vertical wires were inside the telescope eyepiece. An astronomer would press a button every time a star appeared to cross one of the wires, which would send an impulse to the clock. This was compared with the solar time observed on the Riefler Clock No. 224 and results published by the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac. The result was a clock that was accurate to the hundredth of a second. In the factory, the sounder audibly ticked off the seconds so that workers could set the watches accurately. After the opening of the observatory, the Elgin National Watch Company adopted the slogan: \\"Elgin Takes The Time From The Stars And Puts It In Your Pocket\\". The Illinois government also equipped the observatory with thermometers, a thermograph, barometer, barograph, rain gauge, and weather vane. This was intended to provide data on weather to Springfield, but was also reproduced in local newspapers. The company was watchful of humidity, as this could affect delicate processes. The Great Depression hit the Elgin National Watch Company badly. Following World War II, Swiss manufacturers began to dominate the pocket watch industry. The final blow came in 1950, when the United States Time Corporation introduced a cheap wristwatch that could be discarded and repurchased for less than the cost of repair. The Elgin National Watch Company ceased watch production in the late 1950s. The observatory was donated to the Elgin Area School District U46 in 1960, who added a planetarium in 1963. This was the first school district planetarium in the State of Illinois. Donald Tuttle (1920–2010) was the first planetarium director. He served from 1963 to 1985. The second director of the Planetarim/Observatory was Gary L. Kutina. He served as director from 1985 to 2009. The observatory was added to the National Register of Historic Places by Gary L. Kutina, Director of the Observatory, on August 16, 1994. Architecture The Elgin National Watch Company Observatory is on the northeast corner of Watch and Raymond Streets, two blocks east from where the factory once stood. It was constructed on a gravel base, which could absorb surface vibrations. Concrete piers were dug down into this layer to secure the telescope and Riefler clocks. The two-story building can be split into three segments: the entrance, the observatory, and the office. The entrance segment connects the other two segments. The walls are made of lath and plaster and the room features a lavatory. The second floor above the entrance is the chronograph room, with one of the two Riefler clocks on a pier. A switchboard in this room directed signals from the observatory to the offices in Chicago. The south wall features a double-hung window. Also to the south is a Warner & Swasey chronograph, used to record the star observations. Also found in the chronograph room were the two auxiliary clocks to the master clocks. These too were Rieflers. One was No. 237 and the other was No. 240. Both clocks are no longer present in the building. A steel doors leads to the entrance of the observatory segment, where there is a stairway to the second floor and a small lavatory. A set of airlock style doors leads to a temperature controlled room with two of the four Riefler clocks on one of the piers. In the clock vault there were 58 light bulbs positioned on the floor. The bulbs would go on and off in accordance to the demand for temperature. The vault was to be maintained at a constant 81 degrees F. These bulbs along with a ventilation shaft could maintain a temperature to within a half of a degree of 81. The two Riefler clocks found in the vault was No. 220 and No. 224. Above the room is a Warner & Swasey celestial transit instrument, on its own pier. The observatory segment is a two-story, concrete, domed octagon, covered with sheet metal. A opening allows observations by the telescope. Steel shutters can close this through a system of chains. Each steel shutter weighed one-half a ton. It was written that the gearing used to open the doors were so easy a child of six could do it. The office segment is to the west. The first floor segment is with two double-hung windows on both the south and west walls. Shelves and cabinets remain in the room from when it was in use. The floor is carpet-covered hardwood and the walls are lath and plaster. The second story of the office segment was the sleeping room, where astronomers could sleep. It originally featured a basin and a cot, with two double-hung windows again on the south and west. In 1926, this room was converted into a radio room to transmit short-wave signals. A vintage 1947 Collins transmitter is still in the room. A staircase in the northeast of this room leads to the tin roof, now covered with aluminum paint. A decorative metal rail surrounds the exterior of the office segment roof. The 1963 planetarium addition is on the rear of the building. It features a perforated aluminum dome and a Spitz A-3-P Star Projector. Up to 65 people can be seated in the addition.

(1979): 197–206. and the uniqueness of The Virtuoso lies primarily in its highly relevant satire on contemporary science and on the Royal Society, which, founded in 1660, was of great interest to Restoration audiences. Shadwell was also known as the Restoration's leading advocate of Ben Jonson's style of humour comedy,Wheatley, Christopher J. \\"'Who Vices Dare Explode': Thomas Shadwell, Thomas Durfey and Didactic Drama of the Restoration.\\" A Companion to Restoration Drama. Ed. Susan J. Owen. Oxford, England: Blackwell, 2008. 340–354. in which each humourous character displays one unique and excessive folly. In his dedication to The Virtuoso, Shadwell claimed that he had created four entirely new humours characters,Shadwell, Thomas. The Virtuoso. Ed. Marjorie Hope Nicolson and David Stuart Rodes. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1966. by which he meant the titular virtuoso Sir Nicholas Gimcrack, Sir Formal Trifle (described in the cast list as \\"the Orator, a florid coxcomb\\"), Sir Samuel Hearty (\\"a brisk, amorous, adventurous, unfortunate coxcomb; one that by the help of humorous, nonsensical bywords takes himself to be a wit\\"), and Sir Nicholas's uncle Snarl (\\"an old, pettish fellow, a great admirer of the last age and a declaimer against the vices of this, and privately very vicious himself.\\") Though some critics believe that Sir Nicholas is an inconsistent character,Borgman, Albert S. Thomas Shadwell: His Life and Comedies. New York City: The New York University Press, 1928. of the four, his is the character with the most significant literary legacy. Scholars have discerned the influence of Sir Nicholas in the works of numerous subsequent playwrights, including Thomas d'Urfey, Lawrence Maidwell, Susanna Centlivre, Aphra Behn, and Peter Pindar. Plot summary Bruce and Longvil, two young men-about-town, described by Shadwell in the cast list as \\"Gentlemen of wit and sense,\\" have fallen in love with the two nieces of the virtuoso, Sir Nicholas Gimcrack. Bruce is in love with Clarinda and Longvil with Miranda. Unfortunately, Clarinda is in love with Longvil and Miranda with Bruce. Each lady also has a rival suitor. Clarinda is wooed by her uncle's best friend, the absurd orator Sir Formal Trifle, and Miranda by a gallant fool, Sir Samuel Hearty. To gain admittance to Sir Nicholas's house where they can see their beloveds, Bruce and Longvil feign an interest in Sir Nicholas's absurd experiments, which include learning to swim on dry land by imitating a frog, transfusing the blood of a sheep into a man (resulting in a sheep's tail growing out of the man's anus), and bottling air from various parts of the country to be stored in his cellar like wine. While they attempt to pay court to Miranda and Clarinda, Bruce and Longvil are in turn courted by Sir Nicholas's promiscuous wife, Lady Gimcrack, who also keeps a lover, Hazard, on the side. Sir Nicholas similarly keeps a lover by the name of Mrs. Flirt, who in turn is having an affair with Hazard. The cast is rounded out by Sir Nicholas's curmudgeonly uncle Snarl, whose money Sir Nicholas hopes to inherit, and Snarl's whore Mrs. Figgup. There follow various contrivances and convolutions, including the seduction of both Bruce and Longvil by Lady Gimcrack, the attempted rape of Sir Samuel (disguised as a woman) by Sir Formal, the discovery that Snarl has a fetish for being beaten with rods, and an uprising of ribbon-weavers, upset because they fear Sir Nicholas has invented a machine that will put them out of business. Ultimately, Bruce and Longvil pragmatically conclude that Bruce should transfer his affections to Miranda (who loves him) and Longvil should transfer his to Clarinda (who loves him.) Meanwhile, Sir Nicholas receives the terrible news that his estates have been seized to pay off debts incurred in his scientific pursuits. He first turns to his wife for help, but she abandons him in favour of Hazard, taking her money with her, then to his uncle Snarl, but Snarl reveals that he has married Mrs. Figgup and Sir Nicholas's hopes of inheriting his money are dashed. Last, Sir Nicholas begs his nieces for their fortunes, but they reveal that they have settled guardianship of their estates with Bruce and Longvil. Hoping at least for continuing love from Mrs. Flirt, Sir Nicholas is once again disappointed, as she informs him that she \\"love(s) men but as far as their money goes.\\" Sir Nicholas is left a ruined man, yet still hoping to discover the philosopher's stone, and Bruce and Longvil are happy in their hopes of eventual marriages to Miranda and Clarinda, respectively. Scientific Satire As Claude Lloyd has demonstrated,Lloyd, Claude. \\"Shadwell and the Virtuosi.” PMLA 44.2 (Jun. 1929): 472–494. virtually all of the experiments that Sir Nicholas Gimcrack performs can be traced directly to a real scientific experiment of the day, most reported either in Robert Hooke’s Micrographia or Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Hooke himself actually attended a performance of the original production and, humiliated, identified himself as the specific target of Shadwell's satire.Chico, Tita. “Gimcrack’s Legacy: Sex, Wealth, and the Theater of Experimental Philosophy.” Comparative Drama 42.1 (Spring 2008): 29–49. While many critics interpret the play as a direct attack on the Royal Society, others argue that, far from satirising the Royal Society, Shadwell was actually focusing on specific follies that the Royal Society expressly rejected,Gilde, Joseph M. “Shadwell and the Royal Society: Satire in the Virtuoso.” SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500–1900 10.3 (Summer 1970): 469–490. or that, as members of the Royal Society at that time included both serious scientists and amateur virtuosos, Shadwell was striking a deathblow against the virtuosos specifically, but that the serious scientists were above attack and thus unharmed by Shadwell's satire.Houghton, Walter R. Jr. “The English Virtuoso in the Seventeenth Century: Part I.” Journal of the History of Ideas 3.1 (Jan. 1942): 51–73.

Early life Arabella Hunt was born in London on 27 February 1662 to Richard and Elizabeth Hunt. She sang at court and is recorded to have performed a part in the court masque \\"Calisto, or the Chaste Nymph\\" by John Crowne in 1675. In 1678 or 1679, her father died, and as the only surviving child (two siblings died in childhood), she inherited a house at Upton in Buckinghamshire. Marriage On 12 September 1680 Hunt married James Howard at St Marylebone Parish Church, and the couple moved into her mother's house at the Haymarket. However, after six months of living together Hunt left her husband, and instituted a case against him at the consistory court in London, seeking to annul the marriage on the grounds that Howard was not in fact a man, but was actually a woman called Amy Poulter (née Gomeldon). Moreover, at the time of their marriage, Poulter was already married to a man called Arthur Poulter, who had only died recently. Hunt further claimed that her 'husband' was an hermaphrodite, but when Howard/Poulter was examined by five midwives appointed as the jury in the case it was found that she was a biologically ordinary woman. The marriage was eventually annulled on 15 December 1682, on the basis that two women could not legally marry each other. Both women were now free to remarry, but Poulter died very shortly afterwards, and Hunt remained unmarried for the rest of her life. Career For many years Hunt was employed at the royal court as a singer and lutenist. She was well thought of by Queen Mary, and taught singing to Princess Anne. Later Queen Mary gave her an annual pension of £100. John Hawkins tells with great detail how the queen, after listening to some of Henry Purcell's music performed by Hunt, John Gostling, and the composer, abruptly asked her to sing a popular Scottish ballad, Cold and Raw, which she did, accompanying herself on the lute. Purcell, according to Hawkins, was \\"not a little nettled\\" by the queen's preference, and when he composed a birthday ode for Queen Mary in 1692 he used Cold and Raw as the repeated bass line for the \\"May her blest example\\" movement.A General History of the Science and Practice of Music, iii. 564 Mrs. Hunt's voice was said by a contemporary to be like the pipe of a bullfinch; she was also credited with an \\"exquisite hand on the lute\\". She was admired and respected by the best wits of the time; John Blow and Purcell wrote difficult music for her; John Hughes, the poet, was her friend; William Congreve wrote a long irregular ode on \\"Mrs. Arabella Hunt singing\\", and after her death penned an epigram under a portrait of her sitting on a bank singing. The painting was by Godfrey Kneller. There are mezzotints by Smith (1706) and Charles Grignion the Elder; and Hawkins gives a vignette in his History.William Hawkins, A General History of the Science and Practice of Music, iii. 761 In an ode, On the Excellency of Mrs Hunt's Voice, and Manner of Singing, composed in 1700, John Blow declared that \\"she reigns alone, is Queen of Musick by the People's choice\\".

The property was originally held by the Tironensian monks of Kilwinning Abbey and was probably the site of the abbot's country retreat.Ness, Page 65 The 17th-century Monkcastle is a category B listed ruin, although it has been consolidated and stands next to a private house, constructed from the converted old home farm buildings. The 19th-century mansion of Monkcastle House is nearby, and is also category B listed. The castle may have been used as a dower house or retreat. History Timothy Pont, in about 1606, described Monkcastle as \\"a pretty fair building veill planted\\".MacGibbon & Ross, Page 121 =Abbots of Kilwinning= Kilwinning Abbey ruins in the 19th century Monkcastle was the administrative centre for the north-west portion of the extensive estates held by the monks of Kilwinning Abbey. Rents were collected here, leases arranged, etc. It was associated with the monk's mill at Craigmill, Dalry.Hay, Page 11 The commendator abbot, Alexander Hamilton, became the Duke of Chatelherault, and under this French title he obtained the tower of Monkland,Campbell, Page 226 later Monkcastle, from the last abbot, Gavin Hamilton. He also obtained Dalgarven, Auchenkist, and Birklands.Finnie, Page 17 Monkcastle was a \\"part of the ancient halydom of Kilwinning, which about this time was beginning to be parcelled out by the Abbots, to whoever would best remunerate them for the ostensible gift, foreseeing that their own possession was becoming doubtful and unsteady.\\" Alexander passed the property to Claud, his third son, who became Commendator of Paisley, at the age of ten, duly ratified and approved by Pope Julius III in 1553;Douglas, Page 1 this may account for the mitred head which appears in a panel above the doorway, together with other sculptures, typical of early 17th-century castles and also found at sites such as Barholm, Ardblair, and Dundarave.MacGibbon & Ross, Page 122 Salter sees two of the carvings as being lizards with human heads.Salter, Page 54 They appear to be more like head lice. =Monkcastle= Monkcastle and Northern Ayrshire. The canal to Glasgow is shown, however this section was never built. A blank armorial panel above the entrance The ruins of Monkcastle are in woodland to the west of the A737 trunk road on the right bank of the River Garnock, south of Dalry and north of Kilwinning and represent a small, late 16th century laird's house which has replaced earlier structures; a Monkcastle is recorded in 1536.Love, Page 53 The castle measures around 48 ft by 18 ft, standing two storeys high, with a central staircase tower projecting, and rising one storey higher. The entirely ruinous interior has extensive brickwork and concrete supports; the ground floor is vaulted. The entrance door is unusually wide and low, with carvings above. The building is domestic, rather than military in style, with corbie-stepped gables and stones laid in courses. In 1895 Smith records the castle ruins as having been recently restored, suggesting consolidation work. The Rev. William Lee Kerr in 1900 described the castle as ruinous and made reference to cellars \\"which can still be traced underground.\\" No such cellars are visible today (2011).Davis, Page 330 Nearby the ruins there are said to be the jumbled remains of an ancient dovecot,Smith, Page 61 in appearance more like an ice house. The OS map shows a formal garden to the south of the castle ruins. Rob Close sees similarities with Crosbie Castle, Prestwick.

Under the ownership of the Grant family the farms were progressively sold off until only the core of the estate remained. An old lane, probably built by the monks for their tenants, ran from the monk's mill at Craigmill in Lynn Glen via Craighead and then down to Monkcastle via High Monkcastle, joining the road to Kilwinning Abbey itself.

Alexander-William Miller was an enthusiastic agricultural reformer and actively controlled the farming of most of the Monkcastle estate. He encouraged 'spade husbandry' and regularly achieved a crop of sixty to seventy bushels per acre, whilst with the plough only thirty was generally produced. The Monkcastle lairds =The Hamiltons= The entrance to Monkcastle with carvings (ground plan to right) Lord Claud Hamilton, third son of Alexander, was created Lord Paisley on 20 July 1552. He was a great adherent to the cause of Queen Mary and after the Battle of Langside his lands were confiscated and passed to Lord Semple who exercised all around a severe military discipline, displaying every violence and oppression on that power can do, to maintain a precarious position. By 1573 the lands had been returned to Lord Claud Hamilton.Douglas, Page 2 Claud's son, James, was created Earl of Abercorn, Baron of Paisley, Hamilton, Mountcastle (sic), and Kilpatrick in 1604Dobie, Page 330 or 1606; in the same year he was appointed as one of the commissioners to treat of an union with England. In 1621, James, second earl, inherited the 8 merk lands of old extent of Monkcastle. In 1648, the lands of Upper and Lower Monkcastle and others passed to James, Duke of Hamilton. At this time (1661) Hugh, Earl of Eglinton, still claimed the lands as a right of superiority in his role of 'Lord of Erection' of Kilwinning Abbey. In 1673, Ann, Duchess of Hamilton, and Susanna, Countess of Cassilis, were heirs of these lands to their father, James, Duke of Hamilton.Dobie, Page 331 =Hay, Wallace, Cuninghame, Coleman, and others= The Earl of Abercorn sold the lands to George Hay, who then conveyed them to the Lairds of Dunlop and Pitcon. John Wallace, minister of Largs, obtained the Monkcastle lands and his son, George, sold them to an advocate, Adam Cuninghame. Adam's sister, Jean, sold the lands to Alexander Miller in 1723 with the permission of her husband, David Forrester of Denovan.

Signature of John Archibald Brownlie of Monkcastle. He purchased the Chapeltoun estate near Stewarton on 21 November 1888 from John Cunningham, Ironmaster, Barrhead. Alexander Miller was a merchant and burgess of Glasgow, dying shortly after his purchase of the estate. His father was William Miller and had two sons, the other being William, also a merchant in Glasgow.Paterson, Page 510 The property passed to his elder brother, William Miller, who married Jean Nimmo of Bridgehouse in Linlithgow in 1727, acquiring through this marriage Netherhill House, in the parish of Torphichen. He died in 1757 at the age of 97, leaving two sons. The estate passed to the elder son, William, who in 1773 married Agnes Cunninghame, daughter of George Cuninghame of Monkredding. Agnes inherited one third of the estate of Monkredding when her brother, Fergusson Cuninghame, died without heir. On William’s death in 1802, he was succeeded by his only child, William Alexander Miller (known as Alexander). Alexander Miller married Warner, daughter of Patrick Warner of Ardeer, and had nine children. He died in 1828, and was succeeded by his eldest son, William.

Such tracks were necessary for many reasons, not least the obligation of thirlage, by which tenants had to take their corn to be ground at the mills held by the monks.Old Roads of Ayrshire Retrieved: 2010-10-06 =Minerals= Monkcastle fireclay mine A view of the inclined plane railway's embankment Monkcastle in 1811 Until 1945 the Douglas Firebrick Company Ltd had its works located where the Wilson Car Auction company now trades (2010).Douglas Firebrick Company Limited. A double track narrow gauge railway, working through a gravity driven 'cable and pulleys' system ran from the works to the fireclay mine on the lands of High Monkcastle. The surface of the inclined plane railroad was paved with firebricks, for employees to walk up the tracks to get to the main Dalry to Kilwinning road where they could catch a bus. The small brick structure gave them shelter from the weather, while they waited. Bessie Dunlop of Lynn The old course of the previously diverted Monkcastle Burn Monkcastle and Monkcastle's home farm buildings in 1906 On 8 November 1576, midwife Bessie Dunlop, resident of Lynne, in Dalry, was accused of sorcery and witchcraft. She answered her accusers that she received information on prophecies or to the whereabouts of lost goods from a Thomas Reid, a former barony officer in Dalry who died at the Battle of Pinkie some 30 years before.Chalmers, Page 70. She said she first met him while walking between her own house and the yard of Monkcastle, and after a discussion he disappeared through a hole in a wall or dyke, apparently too small for a normal person to pass through.Chalmers, Page 71. Bessie also met with the warlock Laird of Auchenskeigh at a thorn tree near to Monkcastle.Love (2009), Page 108 She said she was trained by her “familiar” on how to make and use ointments to heal livestock and people. She was said to have cured and advised various people from poor children to gentry. As a “wise woman” her strange efforts at the time attracted the attention of the law. Her abilities were more akin to today’s current psychics, and with an understanding of medicinal herbs, she was identified in a time of witchcraft hysteria. It resulted in a conviction and the tragic outcome was that she was burnt at the stake at Castle Hill in Edinburgh in 1576.Chalmers, Page 72. Alternatively, she is said to have been burned at the stake at Corsehillmuir, just outside Kilwinning. Monkcastle Glen Wood Pigeon predated by a Sparrowhawk or Peregrine at Monkcastle A Plucking Post in the Monkcastle Glen A rocky glen runs up from Monkcastle with a significant waterfall and a listing as part of a Scottish Wildlife Trust local site for nature conservation. The glen was partly formed from quarrying work for freestone.OS Maps Retrieved: 2010-10-03 A previous course of the Monkcastle Burn can still be followed and this probably resulted from the quarrying intruding into the original course of the burn at the head of the glen resulting in a waterfall and the burn then following the bed of the glen itself. The geology consists of Carboniferous limestone, macroporphyritic basalt, and an overlay of basalt and boulder clay. The quarry workers are thought to have made used of Old Monkcastle as office space for storage, etc. The OS maps show that quarrying had ceased by the start of the 20th century. The woodland policies at Monkcastle are classified as one of the relatively few North Ayrshire 'Ancient Woodland' sites. Aspen (Populus tremulans) has been recorded here; liverworts, ferns, and mosses are common due to the conditions of continuous high humidity. The Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) have designated Monkcastle as part of Listed Wildlife or Local Site for Nature Conservation (LSNC) number 27, together with Monkcastle House, Dalgarven and Smithstone. Aspen (Populus tremula) is the most notable species present, however the presence of Broad-leafed Helleborine (Epipactis helleborine) indicates a woodland containg many mature deciduous trees of some habitat value, together with wet flushes containing yellow flag iris, soft rush, lesser spearwort and golden saxifrage. =Mick's Pond= An area of open water known as Mick's Pond was created for John Coleman by Michael McMorn in the 2000s to the north and this site has been successful in attracting a good number and diversity of waterfowl to the habitats created. Several hardwood trees within the policies have been added to the Woodland Trusts 'Ancient and Notable Trees' register.

Geojit is listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).  About  Geojit was founded by C J George in 1987 and the major stakeholders of the company include C J George – Managing Director of Geojit, global banking major BNP Paribas, Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala. As of 31 December 2017, it has over Rs.41,000 crores as assets under custody and management, servicing over 913,000 clients. The network of Geojit covers more than 300 cities in states in India such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, New Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu & Pondicherry, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal and West Bengal.

History  C J George, founder and CEO of the company set up M/s C.J George and Co. in 1987 with Ranajit Kanjilal as partner. However, a formal partnership was formed in 1988 after Kanjilal acquired membership in the Cochin Stock Exchange. The firm was then renamed as Geojit and Co. The name 'Geojit' was coined by conjoining the first and last three words in the names of the partners who set up the organization - C J George and Ranajit Kanjilal. In 1992, Kanjilal, left the organization and Geojit became sole proprietorship. In 1993, the company opened its first branch in Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam and followed it up with another branch in Trichur in Kerala.  Growth and Expansion  In 1994, Geojit became a public limited company with a new name - Geojit Securities Ltd. It was the first brokerage firm that became a corporate in Kochi and one of the earliest in India. In 1995, Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) became a co-promoter of Geojit by acquiring 22% stake in the company. This is the only instance of a government entity participating in the equity of a stock broking company. A P Kurian who retired from UTI as its Executive Trustee joined the board of the company as an independent director and Chairman. In October 1995, Geojit went public by issuing 9,50,000 shares of Rs.10 each to gain access to more capital. Shares of the company were listed in Cochin, Chennai and Delhi exchanges. The IPO was oversubscribed by 15 times. In the same year, Geojit became a member of the NSE and the opened its first terminal at Cochin. From 1996 onwards, the company focused on expanding its presence as well as products and services. Geojit started depository services in 1997, offering customers Demat facility. In 1999, the company took membership in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and its shares were listed in the BSE in 2000. In February 2000, Geojit launched online trading. In 2003, the company ventured into commodity trading with the launch of rubber trading. In 2004, commodity trading in cardamom was launched. In 2005, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, a renowned Indian Equity Investor, took a significant stake in the company and joined the Board of Directors of the company. In 2005, Geojit launches Geojit Technologies, another sister concern with an aim to develop state-of-the-art technologies for the financial services field. Geojit Credits, a subsidiary of Geojit Financial Services Ltd., was also launched after registering with the Reserve Bank of India as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC). In the same year, Geojit shares were also listed on National Stock Exchange of India Limited. In 2012, Geojit launched Qualified Foreign Investors (QFI) Investment service.

Plurality system Majoritarian system Semi-proportional system Proportional system Mixed system Other An electoral system or voting system is a set of rules that determine how elections and referendums are conducted and how their results are determined. Political electoral systems are organized by governments, while non-political elections may take place in business, non-profit organisations and informal organisations. These rules govern all aspects of the voting process: when elections occur, who is allowed to vote, who can stand as a candidate, how ballots are marked and cast, how the ballots are counted, how votes translate into the election outcome, limits on campaign spending, and other factors that can affect the result. Political electoral systems are defined by constitutions and electoral laws, are typically conducted by election commissions, and can use multiple types of elections for different offices. Some electoral systems elect a single winner to a unique position, such as prime minister, president or governor, while others elect multiple winners, such as members of parliament or boards of directors. There are many variations in electoral systems, but the most common systems are first-past- the-post voting, the two-round (runoff) system, proportional representation and ranked voting. Some electoral systems, such as mixed systems, attempt to combine the benefits of non-proportional and proportional systems. The study of formally defined electoral methods is called social choice theory or voting theory, and this study can take place within the field of political science, economics, or mathematics, and specifically within the subfields of game theory and mechanism design. Impossibility proofs such as Arrow's impossibility theorem demonstrate that when voters have three or more alternatives, it is not possible to design a ranked voting electoral system that reflects the preferences of individuals in a global preference of the community, present in countries with proportional representation and plurality voting. Types of electoral systems =Plurality systems= Countries using first-past-the-post for legislatures. Plurality voting is a system in which the candidate(s) with the highest number of votes wins, with no requirement to get a majority of votes. In cases where there is a single position to be filled, it is known as first-past-the-post; this is the second most common electoral system for national legislatures, with 58 countries using it to elect their legislatures,Table of Electoral Systems Worldwide IDEA the vast majority of which are current or former British or American colonies or territories. It is also the second most common system used for presidential elections, being used in 19 countries. In cases where there are multiple positions to be filled, most commonly in cases of multi-member constituencies, plurality voting is referred to as block voting, multiple non-transferable vote or plurality-at-large. This takes two main forms: in one form voters have as many votes as there are seats and can vote for any candidate, regardless of party – this is used in eight countries. There are variations on this system such as limited voting, where voters are given fewer votes than there are seats to be filled (Gibraltar is the only territory where this system is in use) and single non-transferable vote (SNTV), in which voters can vote for only one candidate in a multi-member constituency, with the candidates receiving the most votes declared the winners; this system is used in Afghanistan, Kuwait, the Pitcairn Islands and Vanuatu. In the other main form of block voting, also known as party block voting, voters can only vote for the multiple candidates of a single party. This is used in five countries as part of mixed systems. The Dowdall system, a multi-member constituency variation on the Borda count, is used in Nauru for parliamentary elections and sees voters rank the candidates depending on how many seats there are in their constituency. First preference votes are counted as whole numbers; the second preference votes divided by two, third preferences by three; this continues to the lowest possible ranking.Nauru Parliament: Electoral system IPU The totals achieved by each candidate determine the winners.Glossary of Terms IDEA =Majoritarian systems= Majoritarian voting is a system in which candidates have to receive a majority of the votes to be elected, although in some cases only a plurality is required in the last round of counting if no candidate can achieve a majority. There are two main forms of majoritarian systems, one using a single round of ranked voting and the other using two or more rounds. Both are primarily used for single-member constituencies. Majoritarian voting can take place in a single round using instant-runoff voting (IRV), whereby voters rank candidates in order of preference; this system is used for parliamentary elections in Australia and Papua New Guinea. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the first round, the second preferences of the lowest-ranked candidate are then added to the totals. This is repeated until a candidate achieves over 50% of the number of valid votes. If not all voters use all their preference votes, then the count may continue until two candidates remain, at which point the winner is the one with the most votes. A modified form of IRV is the contingent vote where voters do not rank all candidates, but have a limited number of preference votes. If no candidate has a majority in the first round, all candidates are excluded except the top two, with the highest remaining preference votes from the votes for the excluded candidates then added to the totals to determine the winner. This system is used in Sri Lankan presidential elections, with voters allowed to give three preferences.Sri Lanka: Election for President IFES The other main form of majoritarian system is the two-round system, which is the most common system used for presidential elections around the world, being used in 88 countries. It is also used in 20 countries for electing the legislature. If no candidate achieves a majority of votes in the first round of voting, a second round is held to determine the winner. In most cases the second round is limited to the top two candidates from the first round, although in some elections more than two candidates may choose to contest the second round; in these cases the second round is decided by plurality voting. Some countries use a modified form of the two-round system, such as Ecuador where a candidate in the presidential election is declared the winner if they receive 40% of the vote and are 10% ahead of their nearest rival,Ecuador: Election for President IFES or Argentina (45% plus 10% ahead), where the system is known as ballotage. An exhaustive ballot is not limited to two rounds, but sees the last-placed candidate eliminated in each round of voting. Due to the potentially large number of rounds, this system is not used in any major popular elections, but is used to elect the Speakers of parliament in several countries and members of the Swiss Federal Council. In some formats there may be multiple rounds held without any candidates being eliminated until a candidate achieves a majority, a system used in the United States Electoral College. =Proportional systems= Countries by type of proportional system Proportional representation is the most widely used electoral system for national legislatures, with the parliaments of over eighty countries elected by various forms of the system. Party-list proportional representation is the single most common electoral system and is used by 80 countries, and involves voters voting for a list of candidates proposed by a party. In closed list systems voters do not have any influence over the candidates put forward by the party, but in open list systems voters are able to both vote for the party list and influence the order in which candidates will be assigned seats. In some countries, notably Israel and the Netherlands, elections are carried out using 'pure' proportional representation, with the votes tallied on a national level before assigning seats to parties. However, in most cases several multi- member constituencies are used rather than a single nationwide constituency, giving an element of geographical representation; but this can result in the distribution of seats not reflecting the national vote totals. As a result, some countries have leveling seats to award to parties whose seat totals are lower than their proportion of the national vote. In addition to the electoral threshold (the minimum percentage of the vote that a party must obtain to win seats), there are several different ways to allocate seats in proportional systems. There are two main types of system: highest average and largest remainder. Highest average systems involve dividing the votes received by each party by a series of divisors, producing figures that determine seat allocation; for example the D'Hondt method (of which there are variants including Hagenbach-Bischoff) and the Webster/Sainte-Laguë method. Under largest remainder systems, parties' vote shares are divided by the quota (obtained by dividing the total number of votes by the number of seats available). This usually leaves some seats unallocated, which are awarded to parties based on the largest fractions of seats that they have remaining. Examples of largest remainder systems include the Hare quota, Droop quota, the Imperiali quota and the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota. Single transferable vote (STV) is another form of proportional representation; in STV, voters rank candidates in a multi-member constituency rather than voting for a party list; it is used in Malta and the Republic of Ireland. To be elected, candidates must pass a quota (the Droop quota being the most common). Candidates that pass the quota on the first count are elected. Votes are then reallocated from the least successful candidates, as well as surplus votes from successful candidates, until all seats have been filled by candidates who have passed the quota. =Mixed systems= In several countries, mixed systems are used to elect the legislature. These include parallel voting and mixed-member proportional representation. In parallel voting systems, which are used in 20 countries, there are two methods by which members of a legislature are elected; part of the membership is elected by a plurality or majority vote in single-member constituencies and the other part by proportional representation. The results of the constituency vote have no effect on the outcome of the proportional vote. Mixed-member proportional representation, in use in eight countries, also sees the membership of the legislature elected by constituency and proportional methods, but in this case the results of the proportional vote are adjusted to balance the seats won in the constituency vote in order to ensure that parties have a number of seats proportional to their vote share. This may result in overhang seats, where parties win more seats in the constituency system than they would be entitled to based on their vote share. Variations of this include the Additional Member System and Alternative Vote Plus, in which voters cast votes for both single-member constituencies and multi-member constituencies; the allocation of seats in the multi-member constituencies is adjusted to achieve an overall seat total proportional to parties' vote share by taking into account the number of seats won by parties in the single-member constituencies. A form of mixed-member proportional representation, Scorporo, was used in Italy from 1993 until 2006. =Additional features= Some electoral systems feature a majority bonus system to either ensure one party or coalition gains a majority in the legislature, or to give the party receiving the most votes a clear advantage in terms of the number of seats. In Greece the party receiving the most votes is given an additional 50 seats,Hellenic Parliament: Electoral system IPU San Marino has a modified two-round system, which sees a second round of voting featuring the top two parties or coalitions if there is no majority in the first round. The winner of the second round is guaranteed 35 seats in the 60-seat Grand and General Council.Consiglio grande e generale: Electoral system IPU In Uruguay, the President and members of the General Assembly are elected by on a single ballot, known as the double simultaneous vote. Voters cast a single vote, voting for the presidential, Senatorial and Chamber of Deputies candidates of that party. This system was also previously used in Bolivia and the Dominican Republic. =Primary elections= Primary elections are a feature of some electoral systems, either as a formal part of the electoral system or informally by choice of individual political parties as a method of selecting candidates, as is the case in Italy. Primary elections limit the risk of vote splitting by ensuring a single party candidate. In Argentina they are a formal part of the electoral system and take place two months before the main elections; any party receiving less than 1.5% of the vote is not permitted to contest the main elections. In the United States, there are both partisan and non-partisan primary elections. =Indirect elections= Some elections feature an indirect electoral system, whereby there is either no popular vote, or the popular vote is only one stage of the election; in these systems the final vote is usually taken by an electoral college. In several countries, such as Mauritius or Trinidad and Tobago, the post of President is elected by the legislature. In others like India, the vote is taken by an electoral college consisting of the national legislature and state legislatures. In the United States, the president is indirectly elected using a two-stage process; a popular vote in each state elects members to the electoral college that in turn elects the President. This can result in a situation where a candidate who receives the most votes nationwide does not win the electoral college vote, as most recently happened in 2000 and 2016. =Systems used outside politics= In addition to the various electoral systems in use in the political sphere, there are numerous others, some of which are proposals and some of which have been adopted for usage in business (such as electing corporate board members) or for organisations but not for public elections. Ranked systems include Bucklin voting, the various Condorcet methods (Copeland's, Dodgson's, Kemeny-Young, Maximal lotteries, Minimax, Nanson's, Ranked pairs, Schulze), the Coombs' method and positional voting. There are also several variants of single transferable vote, including CPO- STV, Schulze STV and the Wright system. Dual-member proportional representation is a proposed system with two candidates elected in each constituency, one with the most votes and one to ensure proportionality of the combined results. Biproportional apportionment is a system whereby the total number of votes is used to calculate the number of seats each party is due, followed by a calculation of the constituencies in which the seats should be awarded in order to achieve the total due to them. Cardinal electoral systems allow voters to score candidates independently. The complexity ranges from approval voting where voters simply state whether they approve of a candidate or not to range voting, where a candidate is scored from a set range of numbers. Other cardinal systems include proportional approval voting, sequential proportional approval voting, satisfaction approval voting, highest median rules (including the majority judgment), and the Janeček Method where voters can cast positive and negative votes. Historically, weighted voting systems were used in some countries. These allocated a greater weight to the votes of some voters than others, either indirectly by allocating more seats to certain groups (such as the Prussian three-class franchise), or by weighting the results of the vote. The latter system was used in colonial Rhodesia for the 1962 and 1965 elections. The elections featured two voter rolls (the 'A' roll being largely European and the 'B' roll largely African); the seats of the House Assembly were divided into 50 constituency seats and 15 district seats. Although all voters could vote for both types of seats, 'A' roll votes were given greater weight for the constituency seats and 'B' roll votes greater weight for the district seats. Weighted systems are still used in corporate elections, with votes weighted to reflect stock ownership. Rules and regulations In addition to the specific method of electing candidates, electoral systems are also characterised by their wider rules and regulations, which are usually set out in a country's constitution or electoral law. Participatory rules determine candidate nomination and voter registration, in addition to the location of polling places and the availability of online voting, postal voting, and absentee voting. Other regulations include the selection of voting devices such as paper ballots, machine voting or open ballot systems, and consequently the type of vote counting systems, verification and auditing used. thumb|300pxCompulsory voting, enforced. Compulsory voting, not enforced. Compulsory voting, enforced (only men). Compulsory voting, not enforced (only men). Historical: the country had compulsory voting in the past. Electoral rules place limits on suffrage and candidacy. Most countries's electorates are characterised by universal suffrage, but there are differences on the age at which people are allowed to vote, with the youngest being 16 and the oldest 21 (although voters must be 25 to vote in Senate elections in Italy). People may be disenfranchised for a range of reasons, such as being a serving prisoner, being declared bankrupt, having committed certain crimes or being a serving member of the armed forces. Similar limits are placed on candidacy (also known as passive suffrage), and in many cases the age limit for candidates is higher than the voting age. A total of 21 countries have compulsory voting, although in some there is an upper age limit on enforcement of the law.Suffrage CIA World Factbook Many countries also have the none of the above option on their ballot papers. In systems that use constituencies, apportionment or districting defines the area covered by each constituency. Where constituency boundaries are drawn has a strong influence on the likely outcome of elections in the constituency due to the geographic distribution of voters. Political parties may seek to gain an advantage during redistricting by ensuring their voter base has a majority in as many constituencies as possible, a process known as gerrymandering. Historically rotten and pocket boroughs, constituencies with unusually small populations, were used by wealthy families to gain parliamentary representation. Some countries have minimum turnout requirements for elections to be valid. In Serbia this rule caused multiple re-runs of presidential elections, with the 1997 election re-run once and the 2002 elections re-run three times due insufficient turnout in the first, second and third attempts to run the election. The turnout requirement was scrapped prior to the fourth vote in 2004.Pro-Western Candidate Wins Serbian Presidential Poll Deutsche Welle, 28 June 2004 Similar problems in Belarus led to the 1995 parliamentary elections going to a fourth round of voting before enough parliamentarians were elected to make a quorum.Elections held in 1995 IPU Reserved seats are used in many countries to ensure representation for ethnic minorities, women, young people or the disabled. These seats are separate from general seats, and may be elected separately (such as in Morocco where a separate ballot is used to elect the 60 seats reserved for women and 30 seats reserved for young people in the House of Representatives), or be allocated to parties based on the results of the election; in Jordan the reserved seats for women are given to the female candidates who failed to win constituency seats but with the highest number of votes, whilst in Kenya the Senate seats reserved for women, young people and the disabled are allocated to parties based on how many seats they won in the general vote. Some countries achieve minority representation by other means, including requirements for a certain proportion of candidates to be women, or by exempting minority parties from the electoral threshold, as is done in Poland,Sejm: Electoral system IPU Romania and Serbia.Narodna skupstina: Electoral system IPU History =Pre-democratic= In ancient Greece and Italy, the institution of suffrage already existed in a rudimentary form at the outset of the historical period. In the early monarchies it was customary for the king to invite pronouncements of his people on matters in which it was prudent to secure its assent beforehand. In these assemblies the people recorded their opinion by clamouring (a method which survived in Sparta as late as the 4th century BCE), or by the clashing of spears on shields. =Early democracy= Voting has been used as a feature of democracy since the 6th century BC, when democracy was introduced by the Athenian democracy. However, in Athenian democracy, voting was seen as the least democratic among methods used for selecting public officials, and was little used, because elections were believed to inherently favor the wealthy and well-known over average citizens. Viewed as more democratic were assemblies open to all citizens, and selection by lot, as well as rotation of office. Generally, the taking of votes was effected in the form of a poll. The practice of the Athenians, which is shown by inscriptions to have been widely followed in the other states of Greece, was to hold a show of hands, except on questions affecting the status of individuals: these latter, which included all lawsuits and proposals of ostracism, in which voters chose the citizen they most wanted to exile for ten years, were determined by secret ballot (one of the earliest recorded elections in Athens was a plurality vote that it was undesirable to win, namely an ostracism vote). At Rome the method which prevailed up to the 2nd century BCE was that of division (). But the system became subject to intimidation and corruption. Hence a series of laws enacted between 139 and 107 BCE prescribed the use of the ballot (), a slip of wood coated with wax, for all business done in the assemblies of the people. For the purpose of carrying resolutions a simple majority of votes was deemed sufficient. As a general rule equal value was made to attach to each vote; but in the popular assemblies at Rome a system of voting by groups was in force until the middle of the 3rd century BCE by which the richer classes secured a decisive preponderance. Most elections in the early history of democracy were held using plurality voting or some variant, but as an exception, the state of Venice in the 13th century adopted approval voting to elect their Great Council.J.J. O'Connor & E. F. Robertson The history of voting MacTutor History of Mathematics archive The Venetians' method for electing the Doge was a particularly convoluted process, consisting of five rounds of drawing lots (sortition) and five rounds of approval voting. By drawing lots, a body of 30 electors was chosen, which was further reduced to nine electors by drawing lots again. An electoral college of nine members elected 40 people by approval voting; those 40 were reduced to form a second electoral college of 12 members by drawing lots again. The second electoral college elected 25 people by approval voting, which were reduced to form a third electoral college of nine members by drawing lots. The third electoral college elected 45 people, which were reduced to form a fourth electoral college of 11 by drawing lots. They in turn elected a final electoral body of 41 members, who ultimately elected the Doge. Despite its complexity, the method had certain desirable properties such as being hard to game and ensuring that the winner reflected the opinions of both majority and minority factions.Miranda Mowbray & Dieter Gollmann (2007) Electing the Doge of Venice: Analysis of a 13th Century Protocol This process, with slight modifications, was central to the politics of the Republic of Venice throughout its remarkable lifespan of over 500 years, from 1268 to 1797. =Development of new systems= Jean-Charles de Borda proposed the Borda count in 1770 as a method for electing members to the French Academy of Sciences. His method was opposed by the Marquis de Condorcet, who proposed instead the method of pairwise comparison that he had devised. Implementations of this method are known as Condorcet methods. He also wrote about the Condorcet paradox, which he called the intransitivity of majority preferences. However, recent research has shown that the philosopher Ramon Llull devised both the Borda count and a pairwise method that satisfied the Condorcet criterion in the 13th century. The manuscripts in which he described these methods had been lost to history until they were rediscovered in 2001.G. Hägele & F. Pukelsheim (2001) \\"Llull's writings on electoral systems\\", Studia Lulliana Vol. 3, pp3–38 Later in the 18th century, apportionment methods came to prominence due to the United States Constitution, which mandated that seats in the United States House of Representatives had to be allocated among the states proportionally to their population, but did not specify how to do so.Apportionment: Introduction American Mathematical Society A variety of methods were proposed by statesmen such as Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and Daniel Webster. Some of the apportionment methods devised in the United States were in a sense rediscovered in Europe in the 19th century, as seat allocation methods for the newly proposed method of party-list proportional representation. The result is that many apportionment methods have two names; Jefferson's method is equivalent to the D'Hondt method, as is Webster's method to the Sainte-Laguë method, while Hamilton's method is identical to the Hare largest remainder method. The single transferable vote (STV) method was devised by Carl Andræ in Denmark in 1855 and in the United Kingdom by Thomas Hare in 1857. STV elections were first held in Denmark in 1856, and in Tasmania in 1896 after its use was promoted by Andrew Inglis Clark. Party-list proportional representation began to be used to elect European legislatures in the early 20th century, with Belgium the first to implement it for its 1900 general elections. Since then, proportional and semi-proportional methods have come to be used in almost all democratic countries, with most exceptions being former British colonies.Proportional Voting Around the World FairVote =Single-winner revival= Perhaps influenced by the rapid development of multiple-winner electoral systems, theorists began to publish new findings about single-winner methods in the late 19th century. This began around 1870, when William Robert Ware proposed applying STV to single-winner elections, yielding instant-runoff voting (IRV).The History of IRV FairVote Soon, mathematicians began to revisit Condorcet's ideas and invent new methods for Condorcet completion; Edward J. Nanson combined the newly described instant runoff voting with the Borda count to yield a new Condorcet method called Nanson's method. Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, proposed the straightforward Condorcet method known as Dodgson's method. He also proposed a proportional representation system based on multi-member districts, quotas as minimum requirements to take seats, and votes transferable by candidates through proxy voting.Charles Dodgson (1884) Principles of Parliamentary Representation Ranked voting electoral systems eventually gathered enough support to be adopted for use in government elections. In Australia, IRV was first adopted in 1893, and continues to be used along with STV today. In the United States in the early-20th-century progressive era, some municipalities began to use Bucklin voting, although this is no longer used in any government elections, and has even been declared unconstitutional in Minnesota.Tony Anderson Solgård & Paul Landskroener (2002) \\"Municipal Voting System Reform: Overcoming the Legal Obstacles\\", Bench & Bar of Minnesota, Vol. 59, no. 9 =Recent developments= The use of game theory to analyze electoral systems led to discoveries about the effects of certain methods. Earlier developments such as Arrow's impossibility theorem had already shown the issues with Ranked voting systems. Research led Steven Brams and Peter Fishburn to formally define and promote the use of approval voting in 1977.Poundstone, William (2008) Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair (and What We Can Do About It), Hill and Young, p198 Political scientists of the 20th century published many studies on the effects that the electoral systems have on voters' choices and political parties,Duverger, Maurice (1954) Political Parties, Wiley Douglas W.

Tideman also devised the ranked pairs method, a Condorcet method that is not susceptible to clones. The study of electoral systems influenced a new push for electoral reform beginning around the 1990s, when proposals were made to replace plurality voting in governmental elections with other methods. New Zealand adopted mixed-member proportional representation for the 1993 general elections and STV for some local elections in 2004. After plurality voting was a key factor in the contested results of the 2000 presidential elections in the United States, various municipalities in the United States began to adopt Instant- runoff voting, although some of them subsequently returned to their prior method. However, attempts at introducing more proportional systems were not always successful; in Canada there were two referendums in British Columbia in 2005 and 2009 on adopting an STV method, both of which failed. In the United Kingdom, a 2011 referendum on adopting IRV saw the proposal rejected. In other countries there were calls for the restoration of plurality or majoritarian systems or their establishment where they have never been used; a referendum was held in Ecuador in 1994 on the adoption the two round system, but the idea was rejected. In Romania a proposal to switch to a two-round system for parliamentary elections failed only because voter turnout in the referendum was too low. Attempts to reintroduce single-member constituencies in Poland (2015) and two-round system in Bulgaria (2016) via referendums both also failed due to low turnout. Comparison of electoral systems Electoral systems can be compared by different means. Attitudes towards systems are highly influenced by the systems' impact on groups that one supports or opposes, which can make the objective comparison of voting systems difficult. There are several ways to address this problem: One approach is to define criteria mathematically, such that any electoral system either passes or fails. This gives perfectly objective results, but their practical relevance is still arguable. Another approach is to define ideal criteria that no electoral system passes perfectly, and then see how often or how close to passing various methods are over a large sample of simulated elections. This gives results which are practically relevant, but the method of generating the sample of simulated elections can still be arguably biased. A final approach is to create imprecisely defined criteria, and then assign a neutral body to evaluate each method according to these criteria. This approach can look at aspects of electoral systems which the other two approaches miss, but both the definitions of these criteria and the evaluations of the methods are still inevitably subjective. Arrow's and Gibbard's theorems prove that no system using ranked voting or cardinal voting, can meet all such criteria simultaneously. Instead of debating the importance of different criteria, another method is to simulate many elections with different electoral systems, and estimate the typical overall happiness of the population with the results, their vulnerability to strategic voting, their likelihood of electing the candidate closest to the average voter, etc. See also *Comparison of electoral systems *Election *List of electoral systems by country *Matrix vote *Spoiler effect *Psephology References External links *ACE Electoral Knowledge Network *The International IDEA Handbook of Electoral System Design IDEA Voting theory Public choice theory Psephology Social choice theory Elections ","title":"Electoral system"},{"id":"29066514","text":"Porky's Preview is a Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Tex Avery. The short was released on April 19, 1941, and stars Porky Pig. Plot Porky Pig has arranged the screening of a film in a film theater for an audience of barnyard animals. The public goes to the ticket booth. A chicken buys tickets for herself and her three \\"children\\" (eggs). A kangaroo tears the tickets (and even the hand that holds it) and throws them in his pouch. A firefly usher leads the audience with his hindquarters as a bright lamp. A skunk has a \\"scent\\" (pun on smelling it, and 1 cent of a dollar) and cannot enter, so he goes through the back door. On stage Porky presents the film he made himself. The accompanying music is a version of the flickering that usually introduced cartoons of Looney Tunes. The film turns out to be a series of small sketches of primitive characters drawn with stick figures, minimalist, with settings that seem to have been penciled by a child. After the film, Porky is surprised to see the theatre in shambles. The only audience remaining is the skunk (whose presence drove away everyone else). The skunk enthusiastically applauds Porky's film. Analysis The basic premise of the film is that a 7-years-old Porky has created a \\"homemade\\" animated cartoon, and demonstrates it to an audience willing to pay an admission fee. The artistic skills of the child are minimal, so the film within a film is depicted in a very simple style. Effectively serving as a parody of its art form. All fictional characters within it are drawn as stick figures, while the animation style is reminiscent of a flip book. For this film within a film, Tex Avery uses a series of blackout gags. Carl Stalling accompanies each joke with a tune already familiar to the audience. Among them are La Cucaracha (first mentioned c. 1819), \\"Aloha ʻOe\\" (1878), \\"The Old Gray Mare\\" (written between 1875 and 1895), \\"Frat\\" (1910, a frequent Warner cartoon staple) and \\"September in the Rain\\" (from a 1937 Warner film and sung by an Al Jolson imitator). Stalling also parodies the typical music score of shorts produced by Warner Bros. Cartoons. The credits of the film within a film make use of The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down (1937), but the familiar tune is simplified, giving the impression that it is played by an amateur. A number of notes are repeated, in the style of a broken record which repeats over and over. The film includes some references to war. When a skunk approaches the box office, the lady working there wears a gas mask to endure its scent. The self-portrait of Porky is marked as draft No. . Reception The Film Daily called the short a \\"fair cartoon\\", saying, \\"Some of the characterizations are amusing... Rate it as just fair.\\" Television Edits The \\"September In The Rain\\" clip has been removed from Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and a few VHS prints in the United States due to its racist content.

The E.S.E. standard was created by Italian Illy in the 1970s and is maintained by the \\"Consortium for the Development and the Protection of the E.S.E. Standard.\\" It is open to all coffee roasters and machine manufacturers, making it the self-acclaimed \\"only open system available to the sector for espresso coffee prepared with paper pods\\".The E.S.E. Standard: What is the ESE standard? Website of the ESE consortium (retrieved on 31 July 2016).  Description  Each E.S.E. pod contains seven grams of coffee compressed into filter pod with a 44mm diameter. In the past, many USA home single-serve brewers used 55mm pods and could not use E.S.E. pods. Also incompatible are Senseo single-serve coffee pods which are larger in diameter (70mm). The pod is placed within a pod adapter in a normal espresso machine or inside the brewing chamber of a pod brewer. The original patent for filter pod technology was registered by K. Cyrus Melikian of Automatic Brewers And Coffee Devices, Inc.(ABCD) in Pennsylvania, USA, in 1959 Eventually licenses for pod technology were granted to an Italian firm and other developers, who created specific standards for proprietary technologies. The original use of pod machines in Italy was to relieve designated office personnel from the tedium of continuous espresso brewing for office staff. In later years pod brewers were developed for the home market, and for restaurants and other food service businesses where espresso was not a specialty. The use of a pod brewer eliminated most of the training required to operate conventional espresso machines.  History of E.S.E.  The E.S.E. design was created by illy in 1989 as a marketing effort to sell convenience in home espresso preparation. In February 1998, the non-profit \\"Consortium for the Development and the Protection of the E.S.E. Standard\\" was founded by seven coffee roasters and machine manufacturers as a guardian of the E.S.E. brand and standard. The E.S.E. specification was intended to be an open design to encourage wide adoption in order to give customers the \\"freedom of choice and guarantee of quality\\".  Espresso taste  Pod brewers allow many food and beverage servers to provide a standardized quality of espresso with repeatable results every time. Some coffee aficionados consider the taste to be markedly inferior to traditional espresso made with freshly ground beans, however, the quality of a cup of espresso is highly subjective, and freshly made espresso is dependent upon the skill of the barista and the maintenance and calibration of the equipment and other factors. Thus, a consumer can often get an inferior cup of espresso from an expensive traditional machine and fresh coffee, if the preparer does not make the espresso properly. Pod users and manufacturers cite inconsistent results from traditional methods as reasons why consumers will sometimes cease to patronize traditional espresso servers, and maintain that the consistent quality of premium espresso pods is comparable to the average cup of hand-crafted espresso, and often creates more consumer loyalty. Current pod technology produces a high volume of crema, the foam created at the top of the cup, and a taste that many consumers find comparable with what is available in current espresso bars. This assessment may be in part due to the lesser frequency of proper barista training by many coffee vendors. The Telegraph noted in an article that Starbucks had temporarily closed some of its outlets to retrain baristas, citing problems with barista preparation of espresso drinks and poor practices such as re- foaming milk or calibrating pressure for non-optimal brewing time. Pod manufacturers note that these problems are generally reduced by the use of automatic machines and pod technology. Advantages of pods include convenience and speed of preparation and easy cleaning, consistency of taste, and less waste of coffee grounds. Disadvantages include significantly higher cost per serving, a weaker coffee than one would get from freshly ground coffee in a larger holder and limited selection of suppliers, as well as some paper waste when the pods are discarded, and mylar film waste from the pouches in which the pods are packed. However, pod manufacturers use only 0.2 grams of paper fiber in a typical 44 mm pod, and this fiber is easily degradable, so the main waste is the pouch packaging film.

It has smooth bark, linear to narrow lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and fifteen, white flowers and cup-shaped or shortened spherical fruit.flower buds and foliageflowers and fruitbase of trunk Description Eucalyptus moorei is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves arranged in opposite pairs, linear to oblong long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, linear to narrow lance-shaped or curved, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole up to long. The flower buds are arranged in clusters of between seven and fifteen in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile, or on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are top-shaped, long and about wide with a conical to horn- shaped operculum. Flowering occurs between February and May and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the level of the rim.A Field Guide to Eucalypts - Brooker & Kleinig volume 1, page 109 Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus moorei was first formally described in 1905 by Joseph Maiden and Richard Hind Cambage from a specimen collected \\"on the highest parts of the Blue Mountains\\" and the description was published in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. In 1999, Ian Brooker and David Kleinig described two subspecies of E. moorei, distinguished by the size and shape of their juvenile leaves, that have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus moorei subsp. moorei has juvenile leaves that are elliptical to oblong and wide; * Eucalyptus moorei subsp. serpentinicola has juvenile leaves that are linear, wide. The National Herbarium of New South Wales lists Eucalyptus dissita K.D.Hill as a species separate from E. moorei and occurring only in the Gibraltar Range National Park the Australian Plant Census lists it as a synonym. The specific epithet (moorei) honours Charles Moore and dissita is a Latin word meaning \\"apart\\" or \\"remote\\". The name serpentinicola refers to the unusual habit of this subspecies that only grows in hills of red soil over serpentinite. Distribution and habitat Narrow-leaved sally grows in sandy soil in heath, sometimes on poorly drained sites or on exposed sandstone. It is found in the Gibraltar Range, Blue Mountains, Tinderry Range and in the Wadbilliga National Park. Subspecies serpentinicola is only known from an area near Gloucester.

He was a painter, a collagist and a social activist.  Education  Snijders started drawing at the age of twelve and had his first solo exhibition when he was twenty years old, catching the attention of the press. After two months in the School of Applied Arts in Eindhoven, he left and went on working as an autodidact artist. In 1961 and 1962 the French Government prized Snijders with a grant, which led him to study in La Grande Chaumière Paris.  Work  His art went ahead of the prevailing movements; he created CoBrA Art before encountering CoBrA works, advanced Pop Art and went even ahead of the return to oil painting in the eighties. As a painter, he first executed expressionistic canvases flooded with drippings (until 1965), then he experimented with drawing (1977), watercolour, gouache, oil and acrylic painting (1976–1988). Ad Snijders explored the field of sculpture with assemblages and collages (since 1965) and mixed media (since 1974). His style has fluctuated between expressionist, figurative and abstract in very material works.P.M.J. Jacobs, Beeldend Nederland: biografisch handboek {2}, Tilburg: P.M.J. Jacobs, 1993, p. 404 Aside of the plastic experimentalism of his works, Snijders was a highly committed artist to society. He co-created the exhibition Schijt aan Schilderkunst (Bollocks to Painting, 1963) with Johan Lennarts and Van der Heyden in the gallery Pijnenborg (Eindhoven). The goal of the exhibition was provoking the not only the audience but the art world proposing an art that would make questions instead of providing answers. The following exhibition he co-created was called \\"Tot lering en vermaak\\" (1970) and Johan Lennarts and Lukas Smits participated in it as well. This time, the exhibition took place in the \\"Van Abbe Museum\\" and the exhibiting space was decorated as a private house. With the question \\"Does art in the museum still make sense?\\" the artists revolutionized the art world once more. In addition to this, the artist opened a gallery called Thornfield (1984) in the space under his studio. The idea was to provide young artists a place to show their work. He put on six exhibitions a year, concentrating on the work of younger artists. Snijders co-founded as well the \\"J66 Foundation\\" (1966–1972) to provide jazz musicians and visual artists with a platform in Eindhoven to collaborate and influence each other mutually. Furthermore, he kept on intensively working on his art, exhibiting at the Van Abbe Museum Eindhoven (1957, 1959, 1961, 1970, 1987), at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam 1958, at the Foundation De Krabbedans, Eindhoven (1958, 1960,'61), at the Museum Fodor Amsterdam (1963), at the Museum Jan Cunen, Oss (1986), and at the Galerie Willy Schoots, Eindhoven (1990) among others. Snijders became a member of the B.B.K. Amsterdam and died in Eindhoven on 25 February 2010.

This neighborhood is often referred to as the East End of the South Side of town today. Its boundaries are Loeb St to the east, Atkison St to the south, Madison St to the west, Mill St to the north, Pringle St to the west, Meadow St to the north connecting to the corner of Loeb St. Weaverton High School, now Weaverton Apartments, being the remaining site of this old unincorporated place is the territorial feature of this neighborhood area. History Although East End residents are vague as to geographic lines that separate Audubon, Audubon Heights and Weaverton, farmers from the southern portion of the county knew Weaverton well from the 1870s until relatively recent times. George Vogel started a general merchandise business in 1871; had a watering trough for the horses and refreshment for the farmer. In later years, two coal mines were opened, corn bins and a stockyard were built, so the farmer could exchange produce for necessities. Many times the \\"trip to town\\" stopped in Weaverton. The Weaverton Milling Co. was formed in 1911 and in 1913 the Weaverton Lumber Company succeeded Ambrose Lumber Yards. The Kleymeyer Brickyards (1868) might be considered part of Weaverton, if Clay Street is accepted as the boundary, although Henry Kleymeyer's house was on a hill overlooking Audubon. Weaverton Grade School The old Weaverton grade school (east of Atkinson Street, off Pringle) existed as far back as 1889 and was torn down in 1916 or 1918. Both it and the old Audubon School were in the county system. In 1957, schools serving the neighborhood were desegregated. It is said that three young black males, James W. Clancey Jr., Shane Dunise Bushrod and Alvin Eugene Barnes, from the Brookstown neighborhood on US 60 at the west city limits, stepped forward to test whether the Declaration of Independence really meant that part about all men being treated equal. The three signed up to attend Weaverton Elementary School, being the first local black students ever to register to attend classes as equals with white students. The matter kicked off the incident where 570 White children walked out of Weaverton Elementary School protesting the enrollment of five Negro pupils. About half of the 872 children remained in class.\\"Parents Lead Children Out\\", Milwaukee Journal, September 23, 1956Fosl, Catherine, and Tracy Elaine K'Meyer.

When local merchants and others bought stock, the name was changed to Henderson Wagon Works and 600 horse-drawn wagons were produced annually, until the money panic of 1913–14 caused Sears, Roebuck Co. to stop buying them. Later it was used by Heinz Cannery and Atlas Tack Co. The factory (near the north boundary of the Weaverton area) was destroyed by a massive fire during the summer of 1978.

SIP has gained momentum in those environments where a customer's requirements are subject to ongoing changes or where the development of a project or procurement exercise is expected to be implemented gradually. In such circumstances customers may choose to employ the SIP process rather than issuing a formal tender. The advantages of SIP are that changes to a customer's requirements or specifications do not require that this information be re-issued as would normally be the case with a tender (with the exception of minor modifications). Instead a customer, during the planning process of a project or procurement requirement, solicits ongoing information and feedback from prospective vendors and contractors making an assessment of their capability, skills, financial competitiveness and overall suitability during the communications process. The SIP process is sometimes considered by critics to be a less formal procedure in which the qualification of vendors and contractors is not addressed with the same scrutiny as would be the case in a tender. This belief is however erroneous as the quality of the SIP process, just as with tendering, is at the discretion of the selector. Those customers bound by statutory procurement procedures or corporate policies governing the same, apply these requirements to the SIP process by means of ongoing dialogue and solicitation of information from vendors and contractors. For these reasons and among specific industries, such as construction, as well as in certain economic environments, the SIP process is considered to be a viable alternative to traditional tendering and which has resulted in the rapid growth of this process in recent years.

In actual modern practice, call detail records are much more detailed, and contain attributes such as: * the phone number of the subscriber originating the call (calling party, A-party) * the phone number receiving the call (called party, B-party) * the starting time of the call (date and time) * the call duration * the billing phone number that is charged for the call * the identification of the telephone exchange or equipment writing the record * a unique sequence number identifying the record * additional digits on the called number used to route or charge the call * the disposition or the results of the call, indicating, for example, whether or not the call was connected * the route by which the call entered the exchange * the route by which the call left the exchange * call type (voice, SMS, etc.) * any fault condition encountered Each exchange manufacturer decides which information is emitted on the tickets and how it is formatted. Examples: * Send the timestamp of the end of call instead of duration * Voice- only machines may not send call type * Some small PBX does not send the calling party In some corporate private branch exchange (PBX) systems, a call detail record is termed a station messaging detail record (SMDR). Uses Call detail records serve a variety of functions. For telephone service providers, they are critical to the production of revenue, in that they provide the basis for the generation of telephone bills. For law enforcement, call detail records provide a wealth of information that can help to identify suspects, in that they can reveal details as to an individual's relationships with associates, communication and behavior patterns, and even location data that can establish the whereabouts of an individual during the entirety of the call. For companies with PBX telephone systems, call detail records provide a means of tracking long-distance access, can monitor telephone usage by department or office, and can create listing of incoming and outgoing calls. Privacy The U.S. Supreme Court has held the records of numbers called are not protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States because the caller \\"voluntarily conveyed numerical information to the telephone company.\\"Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 744 (1979) But there is limited protection under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. The revelation that call metadata records are being universally collected and stored in the U.S. and elsewhere has generated considerable controversy. In June 2013, a top secret order of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was leaked to the public. That order referenced and defined call detail records as follows: Usage in research CDRs have been found various uses in academic research, with topics ranging from social networks to human mobility .Blondel, V.D., Decuyper, A. & Krings G. \\"A survey of results on mobile phone datasets analysis\\" See also * Charging data record * Customer proprietary network information * NSA call database * Telecommunications data retention * Pen register * Internet Protocol Detail Record * Communications data * Datacom * Average call duration *Answer/seizure ratio References External links * Visualize/playback 6-months' Call Detail Records – records of German politician Malte Spitz (ZeitOnline) Telephony Telecommunications economics ","title":"Call detail record"},{"id":"29066932","text":"Postplatyptilia camptosphena is a moth of the family Pterophoridae.

To Fashion Indie Magazine, she said, \\"I decided to put up this song on MySpace. [...] it was basically a \\"diss track\\" and I didn't expect anything out of it. It was just to make me feel good like how music usually do but Niles [of the Cataracs] came across to my page and was really into my voice and they kind of got me into singing and opened up my eyes to business opportunities\\". She dropped out of college in her first year to pursue her singing career and was then signed by the Los Angeles-based record label and management team, Indie- Pop, who also discovered The Cataracs. Six months later, Dev and The Cataracs' song \\"2Nite\\" began to gain exposure on the radio, the television channel MtvU and the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart. In 2009, Dev moved to Los Angeles to produce music with the Cataracs and work directly with Indie-Pop. In 2010, the Cataracs produced \\"Like a G6\\" with Far East Movement and decided to use a verse from Dev's single \\"Booty Bounce\\" as the chorus. The two songs were made in the same summer, at the time where Dev and the Cataracs \\"were grinding it out in the studio pretty tough together,\\" making a couple of \\"simplistic random tracks.\\" \\"Like a G6\\", which features Far East Movement and Dev, was released in April 2010, and reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song went on to sell over four million downloads in the US.

In October 2010, Dev was signed to Universal Republic and her first official single, \\"Bass Down Low\\", was serviced to rhythmic radio stations in November. It was released digitally in select territories on December 6, 2010, and one day later in the United States. The song reached sixty one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number two on the Heatseekers Songs chart. In Canada, the song peaked at number thirty five in its fifth week on the Canadian Hot 100 chart. However, \\"Bass Down Low\\" saw massive success in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number ten on the UK Singles Chart. =2011–13: The Night the Sun Came Up= On April 25, 2011, she released the single \\"In the Dark\\". The song enjoyed commercial success in the United States, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the summit of Hot Dance Club Songs and peaked in the top forty in Canada, Australia, Denmark, Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom. The song's music video features shots of black-painted hands that touch Dev while she is standing naked. Dev's debut album The Night the Sun Came Up has been released in United Kingdom on September 20, 2011. Since 2009, Dev has been working on her debut album with main producers, The Cataracs. In March 2011, Dev and The Cataracs traveled to Costa Rica for three weeks where they recorded and produced most of the material for the new album. She said of the album's genres, \\"typical pop music is not what I am only good at doing; I have a lot of ideas and hip-hop influence records, some electro ballads.\\" In March 2011, New Boyz's single \\"Backseat\\", featuring Dev and The Cataracs, was released.

The EP was released via iTunes on December 15. The two EPs will subsequently put together in one album but it will not be considered as a real album. The third track from the second part, \\"Parade\\", was released as the lead single. In 2015, Dev collaborated with female electro duo Nervo for their single \\"Hey Ricky\\", which was scheduled to be released with an attached video in April 2015. The single also features Kreayshawn, who directed the video. A snippet of the video leaked on March 23, 2015. The video, released on Vevo on June 2, 2015, went viral, topping the real-time US chart. In December 2015, Dev was also featured as the main vocalist on the club hit \\"Electric Walk\\" by electro-house producer Nytrix. The song peaked at eight on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. On January 25, 2016, Idolator posted a snippet of a song called \\"Lowkey\\" and wrote that on January 27, Ebro Darden would premiere Dev's first single on Beats1 from her upcoming second album. Dev worked mainly with her friend-producer NanosauR, Dave Tozer and Rey Reel. \\"Lowkey\\" was released on March 8, 2016. The song was praised by the critic and compared to Selena Gomez's \\"Good for You\\". In February 2016, Dev was featured as the main vocalist on \\"We Rock It\\" by Sander Kleinenberg. In August 2016, Dev signed with Barry Weiss's record label RECORDS and began promoting her album with the single \\"#1\\" featuring Nef the Pharaoh, which reached the top 15 of the Billboard Rhythmic songs chart. In July 2017, Dev kicked off the campaign for her sophomore album I Only See You When I'm Dreamin' with the release of two singles All I Wanna Do & Come at Me along with the pre-order of the album due September 8. Dev has worked with collaborators such as RAYE, MNDR, Sarah Hudson and Marko Penn on the record. From 2018, Dev began releasing stand alone singles with \\"Rock On It\\", \\"Down For Me\\", \\"Girls Don't Lie\\" and \\"Clean Break\\" being released throughout 2018.

Beginning in July 2020 Dev started releasing a single every three weeks starting with \\"Mango\\" on July 17, \\"Follow My Lead\\" on August and \\"Bom Dia\\" on September 1. Musical style Dev's electro style and \\"sing- talk\\" vocal style have been compared to fellow pop singer Kesha. Dev responded to this, saying, \\"I'm confident enough in what I do that people will see me for who I am ... I get why people compare us but once people see me live they won't connect us as much.\\" While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that \\"Dev's beats come off a bit more mellow and her songs a little bit more electro than pop.\\" In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, \\"I just feel that I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm going to be able to give you a little bit more than what you've heard on those records. When my album comes out, hopefully I won't have to hear another reference or comparison.\\" Much of Dev's music is inspired by rap music, as she believes that fans respond to \\"pop music but with rap roots\\". She said, \\"I've always been into hip-hop. Eminem changed my life when I was younger.\\" The Hollywood Reporter compared her \\"futuristic\\" and \\"pulsing\\" sound to underground electroclash musicians Peaches and Yelle. Dev's musical genres have been cited as electro-crunk and electropop. Personal life In September 2011, Dev publicly announced that she was expecting a baby girl due December 24, 2011.

A threat can be either a negative \\"intentional\\" event (i.e. hacking: an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or an \\"accidental\\" negative event (e.g. the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of a natural disaster event such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado) or otherwise a circumstance, capability, action, or event.Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary This is differentiated from a threat actor who is an individual or group that can perform the threat action, such as exploiting a vulnerability to actualise a negative impact. Definitions ISO 27005 defines threat as: :A potential cause of an incident, that may result in harm of systems and organization A more comprehensive definition, tied to an Information assurance point of view, can be found in \\"Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems\\" by NIST of United States of America :Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, or individuals through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. Also, the potential for a threat-source to successfully exploit a particular information system vulnerability. National Information Assurance Glossary defines threat as: :Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact an IS through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data, and/or denial of service. ENISA gives a similar definition: :Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact an asset [G.3] through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data, and/or denial of service. The Open Group defines threat as:Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009. :Anything that is capable of acting in a manner resulting in harm to an asset and/or organization; for example, acts of God (weather, geological events,etc.); malicious actors; errors; failures. Factor analysis of information risk defines threat as: :threats are anything (e.g., object, substance, human, etc.) that are capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm. A tornado is a threat, as is a flood, as is a hacker. The key consideration is that threats apply the force (water, wind, exploit code, etc.) against an asset that can cause a loss event to occur. National Information Assurance Training and Education Center gives a more articulated definition of threat:Schou, Corey (1996). Handbook of INFOSEC Terms, Version 2.0. CD-ROM (Idaho State University & Information Systems Security Organization) :The means through which the ability or intent of a threat agent to adversely affect an automated system, facility, or operation can be manifest. Categorize and classify threats as follows: Categories Classes Human Intentional Unintentional Environmental Natural Fabricated 2. Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to a system in the form of destruction, disclosure, modification or data, and/or denial of service. 3. Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to the ADP system or activity in the form of destruction, disclosure, and modification of data, or denial of service. A threat is a potential for harm. The presence of a threat does not mean that it will necessarily cause actual harm. Threats exist because of the very existence of the system or activity and not because of any specific weakness. For example, the threat of fire exists at all facilities regardless of the amount of fire protection available. 4. Types of computer systems related adverse events (i. e. , perils) that may result in losses. Examples are flooding, sabotage and fraud. 5. An assertion primarily concerning entities of the external environment (agents); we say that an agent (or class of agents) poses a threat to one or more assets; we write: T(e;i) where: e is an external entity; i is an internal entity or an empty set. 6. An undesirable occurrence that might be anticipated but is not the result of a conscious act or decision. In threat analysis, a threat is defined as an ordered pair, , suggesting the nature of these occurrences but not the details (details are specific to events). 7. The potential violation of security. 8. A set of properties of a specific external entity (which may be either an individual or class of entities) that, in union with a set of properties of a specific internal entity, implies a risk (according to a body of knowledge).g Phenomenology The term \\"threat\\" relates to some other basic security terms as shown in the following diagram: + - - - - - - - - - - - - + + - - - - + + - - - - - - - - - - -+ An Attack: Counter-  A System Resource:  i.e., A Threat Action  measure  Target of the Attack  +----------+   +-----------------+  Attacker |<||<=   i.e., Passive   Vulnerability   A Threat |<=>||<>   Agent or Active   +-------|||-------+  +----------+ Attack   VVV    Threat Consequences + - - - - - - - - - - - - + + - - - - + + - - - - - - - - - - -+ A resource (both physical or logical) can have one or more vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a threat agent in a threat action. The result can potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability properties of resources (potentially different than the vulnerable one) of the organization and others involved parties (customers, suppliers). The so-called CIA triad is the basis of information security. The attack can be active when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises Integrity or Availability. A \\"passive attack\\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources: so it compromises Confidentiality. OWASP: relationship between threat agent and business impact OWASP (see figure) depicts the same phenomenon in slightly different terms: a threat agent through an attack vector exploits a weakness (vulnerability) of the system and the related security controls causing a technical impact on an IT resource (asset) connected to a business impact. A set of policies concerned with information security management, the Information security management systems (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to risk management principles, the countermeasures in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country. Countermeasures are also called security controls; when applied to the transmission of information are named security services. The overall picture represents the risk factors of the risk scenario. The widespread of computer dependencies and the consequent raising of the consequence of a successful attack, led to a new term cyberwarfare. Nowadays the many real attacks exploit Psychology at least as much as technology. Phishing and Pretexting and other methods are called social engineering techniques.Security engineering:a guide to building dependable distributed systems, second edition, Ross Anderson, Wiley, 2008 – 1040 pages , Chapter 2, page 17 The Web 2.0 applications, specifically Social network services, can be a mean to get in touch with people in charge of system administration or even system security, inducing them to reveal sensitive information. One famous case is Robin Sage. The most widespread documentation on computer insecurity is about technical threats such as a computer virus, trojan and other malware, but a serious study to apply cost effective countermeasures can only be conducted following a rigorous IT risk analysis in the framework of an ISMS: a pure technical approach will let out the psychological attacks, that are increasing threats. Threats classification  Threats can be classified according to their type and origin:ISO/IEC, \\"Information technology – Security techniques-Information security risk management\\" ISO/IEC FIDIS 27005:2008 * Types of threats: ** Physical damage: fire, water, pollution ** Natural events: climatic, seismic, volcanic ** Loss of essential services: electrical power, air conditioning, telecommunication ** Compromise of information: eavesdropping, theft of media, retrieval of discarded materials ** Technical failures: equipment, software, capacity saturation, ** Compromise of functions: error in use, abuse of rights, denial of actions Note that a threat type can have multiple origins. * Deliberate: aiming at information asset ** spying ** illegal processing of data * Accidental ** equipment failure ** software failure * Environmental ** natural event ** loss of power supply *Negligence: Known but neglected factors, compromising the network safety and sustainability Threat classification Microsoft has proposed a threat classification called STRIDE, from the initials of threat categories: * Spoofing of user identity * Tampering * Repudiation * Information disclosure (privacy breach or Data leak) * Denial of Service (D.o.S.) * Elevation of privilege Microsoft previously rated the risk of security threats using five categories in a classification called DREAD: Risk assessment model. The model is considered obsolete by Microsoft. The categories were: * Damage – how bad would an attack be? * Reproducibility – how easy it is to reproduce the attack? * Exploitability – how much work is it to launch the attack? * Affected users – how many people will be impacted? * Discoverability – how easy it is to discover the threat? The DREAD name comes from the initials of the five categories listed. The spread over a network of threats can lead to dangerous situations. In military and civil fields, threat level has been defined: for example INFOCON is a threat level used by the US. Leading antivirus software vendors publish global threat level on their websites. Associated terms =Threat agents or actors= The term Threat Agent is used to indicate an individual or group that can manifest a threat. It is fundamental to identify who would want to exploit the assets of a company, and how they might use them against the company. > Individuals within a threat population; Practically anyone and anything can, > under the right circumstances, be a threat agent – the well-intentioned, but > inept, computer operator who trashes a daily batch job by typing the wrong > command, the regulator performing an audit, or the squirrel that chews > through a data cable. Threat agents can take one or more of the following actions against an asset: * Access – simple unauthorized access * Misuse – unauthorized use of assets (e.g., identity theft, setting up a porn distribution service on a compromised server, etc.) * Disclose – the threat agent illicitly discloses sensitive information * Modify – unauthorized changes to an asset * Deny access – includes destruction, theft of a non-data asset, etc. It is important to recognize that each of these actions affects different assets differently, which drives the degree and nature of loss. For example, the potential for productivity loss resulting from a destroyed or stolen asset depends upon how critical that asset is to the organization's productivity. If a critical asset is simply illicitly accessed, there is no direct productivity loss. Similarly, the destruction of a highly sensitive asset that does not play a critical role in productivity would not directly result in a significant productivity loss. Yet that same asset, if disclosed, can result in significant loss of competitive advantage or reputation, and generate legal costs. The point is that it is the combination of the asset and type of action against the asset that determines the fundamental nature and degree of loss. Which action(s) a threat agent takes will be driven primarily by that agent's motive (e.g., financial gain, revenge, recreation, etc.) and the nature of the asset. For example, a threat agent bent on financial gain is less likely to destroy a critical server than they are to steal an easily pawned asset like a laptop. It is important to separate the concept of the event that a threat agent get in contact with the asset (even virtually, i.e. through the network) and the event that a threat agent act against the asset. OWASP collects a list of potential threat agents to prevent system designers, and programmers insert vulnerabilities in the software. Threat Agent = Capabilities + Intentions + Past Activities These individuals and groups can be classified as follows: * Non-Target Specific: Non-Target Specific Threat Agents are computer viruses, worms, trojans and logic bombs. * Employees: Staff, contractors, operational/maintenance personnel, or security guards who are annoyed with the company. * Organized Crime and Criminals: Criminals target information that is of value to them, such as bank accounts, credit cards or intellectual property that can be converted into money. Criminals will often make use of insiders to help them. * Corporations: Corporations are engaged in offensive information warfare or competitive intelligence. Partners and competitors come under this category. * Human, Unintentional: Accidents, carelessness. * Human, Intentional: Insider, outsider. * Natural: Flood, fire, lightning, meteor, earthquakes. =Threat source= Threat sources are those who wish a compromise to occur. It is a term used to distinguish them from threat agents/actors who are those who carry out the attack and who may be commissioned or persuaded by the threat source to knowingly or unknowingly carry out the attack.HMG IA Standard No. 1 Technical Risk Assessment =Threat communities= ;Threat communities :Subsets of the overall threat agent population that share key characteristics. The notion of threat communities is a powerful tool for understanding who and what we’re up against as we try to manage risk. For example, the probability that an organization would be subject to an attack from the terrorist threat community would depend in large part on the characteristics of your organization relative to the motives, intents, and capabilities of the terrorists. Is the organization closely affiliated with ideology that conflicts with known, active terrorist groups? Does the organization represent a high profile, high impact target? Is the organization a soft target? How does the organization compare with other potential targets? If the organization were to come under attack, what components of the organization would be likely targets? For example, how likely is it that terrorists would target the company information or systems? :The following threat communities are examples of the human malicious threat landscape many organizations face: :*Internal :** Employees :** Contractors (and vendors) :** Partners :*External :** Cyber-criminals (professional hackers) :** Spies :**Non-professional hackers :** Activists :** Nation-state intelligence services (e.g., counterparts to the CIA, etc.) :** Malware (virus/worm/etc.) authors =Threat action= Threat action is an assault on system security. A complete security architecture deals with both intentional acts (i.e. attacks) and accidental events. Various kinds of threat actions are defined as subentries under \\"threat consequence\\". =Threat analysis= Threat analysis is the analysis of the probability of occurrences and consequences of damaging actions to a system. It is the basis of risk analysis. =Threat consequence= Threat consequence is a security violation that results from a threat action. Includes disclosure, deception, disruption, and usurpation. The following subentries describe four kinds of threat consequences, and also list and describe the kinds of threat actions that cause each consequence. Threat actions that are accidental events are marked by \\"*\\". ;\\"Unauthorized disclosure\\" (a threat consequence) : A circumstance or event whereby an entity gains access to data for which the entity is not authorized.

Very large organizations tend to adopt business continuity management plans in order to protect, maintain and recover business-critical processes and systems. Some of these plans foreseen to set up computer security incident response team (CSIRT) or computer emergency response team (CERT) There is some kind of verification of the threat management process: * Information security audit * Penetration test Most organizations perform a subset of these steps, adopting countermeasures based on a non-systematic approach: computer insecurity studies the battlefield of computer security exploits and defences that results. Information security awareness is a significant market (see :Computer security companies). There has been a lot of software developed to deal with IT threats, including both open-source software (see :free security software) and proprietary software (see :computer security software companies for a partial list). =Cyber threat management= Threat management involves a wide variety of threats including physical threats like flood and fire. While ISMS risk assessment process does incorporate threat management for cyber threats such as remote buffer overflows the risk assessment process doesn't include processes such as threat intelligence management or response procedures. Cyber threat management (CTM) is emerging as the best practice for managing cyber threats beyond the basic risk assessment found in ISMS. It enables early identification of threats, data-driven situational awareness, accurate decision-making, and timely threat mitigating actions. CTM includes: * Manual and automated intelligence gathering and threat analytics * Comprehensive methodology for real-time monitoring including advanced techniques such as behavioural modelling * Use of advanced analytics to optimize intelligence, generate security intelligence, and provide Situational Awareness * Technology and skilled people leveraging situational awareness to enable rapid decisions and automated or manual actions  Threat hunting  Cyber threat hunting is \\"the process of proactively and iteratively searching through networks to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions.\\" This is in contrast to traditional threat management measures, such as firewalls intrusion detection systems, and SIEMs, which typically involve an investigation after there has been a warning of a potential threat, or an incident has occurred. Threat hunting can be a manual process, in which a security analyst sifts through various data information using their knowledge and familiarity with the network to create hypotheses about potential threats. To be even more effective and efficient, however, threat hunting can be partially automated, or machine-assisted, as well. In this case, the analyst utilizes software that harnesses machine learning and user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA) to inform the analyst of potential risks. The analyst then investigates these potential risks, tracking suspicious behaviour in the network. Thus hunting is an iterative process, meaning that it must be continuously carried out in a loop, beginning with a hypothesis. There are three types of hypotheses: * Analytics-driven: \\"Machine-learning and UEBA, used to develop aggregated risk scores that can also serve as hunting hypotheses\\" * Situational-awareness driven: \\"Crown Jewel analysis, enterprise risk assessments, company- or employee-level trends\\" * Intelligence-driven: \\"Threat intelligence reports, threat intelligence feeds, malware analysis, vulnerability scans\\" The analyst researches their hypothesis by going through vast amounts of data about the network. The results are then stored so that they can be used to improve the automated portion of the detection system and to serve as a foundation for future hypotheses. The SANS Institute has conducted research and surveys on the effectiveness of threat hunting to track and disrupt cyber adversaries as early in their process as possible. According to a survey released in 2016, \\"adopters of this model reported positive results, with 74 percent citing reduced attack surfaces, 59 percent experiencing faster speed and accuracy of responses, and 52 percent finding previously undetected threats in their networks.\\" See also * Cyber threat hunting * Exploit (computer security) * IETF * Information technology security audit * Information Security * Intrusion detection system * IT risk * Physical Security * Vulnerability management References External links *Term in FISMApedia *Cyber Threat Management Framework Computer network security Computer security Computer security exploits Security compliance ","title":"Threat (computer)"},{"id":"29066983","text":"The Malaspina circumnavigation expedition was an interdisciplinary research project to assess the impact of global change on the oceans and explore their biodiversity. The 250 scientists on board the Hespérides and Sarmiento de Gamboa embarked on an eight-month expedition (starting in December 2010) scientific research with training for young researchers - advancing marine science and fostering the public understanding of science. The project was under the umbrella of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation's Consolider – Ingenio 2010 programme and was led by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) with the support of the Spanish Navy. It is named after the original scientific Malaspina Expedition between 1789 and 1794, that was commanded by Alejandro Malaspina. Due to Malaspina's involvement in a conspiracy to overthrow the Spanish government, he was jailed upon his return and a large part of the expedition's reports and collections were put away unpublished, not to see the light again until late in the 20th century.  Objectives  = Assessing the impact of global change on the oceans = Global change relates to the impact of human activities on the functioning of the biosphere. These include activities which, although performed locally, have effects on the functioning of the earth's system as a whole. The ocean plays a central role in regulating the planet's climate and is its biggest sink of CO2 and other substances produced by human activity. The project will put together Colección Malaspina 2010, a collection of environmental and biological data and samples which will be available to the scientific community for it to evaluate the impacts of future global changes. This will be particularly valuable, for example, when new technologies allow levels of pollutants below current thresholds of detection to be evaluated. = Exploring the biodiversity of the deep ocean = Half the Earth's surface is covered by oceans over 3,000 metres deep, making them the biggest ecosystem on the planet. Nevertheless, due to the limitations of the technology available until just recently, the oceans remain something of a mystery. Indeed, it is often said that we know more about the Moon or Mars than Earth's oceans. The development of new genomic techniques has now made it possible to explore life's diversity in the sunless depths of the oceans and assess the metabolic potential of the life they conceal. Exploring biodiversity in the ocean's depths could also yield important discoveries with applications in biotechnology. = Assessing the impact of the original Malaspina expedition = Using sources in the countries visited, the project also aims to assess the socio-political impact of the Malaspina expedition in the regions it explored, and review the biography and historiography of Alejandro Malaspina, with particular emphasis on the work done in the wake of the expedition. = Promoting marine science in Spain and public understanding of issues in marine sciences = Spain has played a leading role in the exploration of the planet's resources, and remains a benchmark in international oceanographic research. The project aims to foster platforms for cooperation within the marine research community in Spain, and to bring science and research on global change closer to the public through various outreach activities, such as exhibitions, lecture series, etc. = Raising the interest for marine sciences within the youth and training young scientists in a global perspective to ocean sciences = The project will be a unique opportunity to promote the training of young researchers in marine sciences. Four postgraduate programmes have jointly coordinated a training module, included in the FBBVA-CSIC's Malaspina Expedition Doctoral Programme, financed by the BBVA Foundation and the CSIC. The high point of this training module will be the use of the Sarmiento de Gamboa as a teaching vessel on the leg of the journey between Miami and Las Palmas.  Research blocks  The expedition's research work is subdivided into 11 blocks: = Thematic blocks = * Physical oceanography: changes in the physical properties of the ocean * Ocean biochemistry: carbon, nutrients and trace gases * Atmospheric deposition and organic pollutants * Optics, phytoplankton, production and metabolism * Microbiological diversity and ecological function * The distribution and role of zooplankton in the world's oceans * The Malaspina expedition. Science and politics on the other side of the ocean = Horizontal blocks = * Coordination * Science and society * Training * Integration  Route taken by the expedition  The Malaspina expedition, taking place between December 2010 and July 2011, will involve two oceanographic research vessels: The Hespérides, operated by the Spanish Navy, which will circumnavigate the globe, and the R/V Sarmiento de Gamboa, operated by the Marine Technology Unit from the CSIC, which will sail from Cadiz to Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) and then return to Cadiz, where it will host a ‘floating university’ providing oceanographic training for a group of master's degree students. = Route of the Hesperides = * Cartagena - Cadiz * Cadiz - Río de Janeiro * Rio de Janeiro - Cape Town * Cape Town - Perth * Perth - Sydney * Sydney - Auckland * Auckland - Honolulu * Honolulu - Cartagena de Indias * Cartagena de Indias - Cádiz References  External links  * Circumnavigation expedition Malaspina.

He is the former manager of Creed, Paramore and Sevendust, and the current manager of YouTube star Blacklite District. In 2006 he set up the independent Orlando, Florida-based label Silent Majority Group, which is now home to Framing Hanley, Candlebox, Tantric, Brother Sundance, Veio, and Fire Fight. Career Hanson discovered Creed in December 1996 when they played live at Floyd's Music Store in Tallahassee, Florida. At the time the band was unknown and their set-list contained mostly covers and two original songs. Jeff signed Creed to his artist management company, JHMP, soon after he asked friend John Kurzweg, to produce the band's first record and according to Jeff, in an interview with HitQuarters, the album cost only $6,000 to make and eventually sold around 6 million copies. Creed went on to sell over 35 million records and millions of tickets worldwide. During this time, Jeff Hanson served as executive producer of both The Scorpion King and Scream 3 soundtracks. Jeff also served as A&R; consultant for Island Def Jam during Lyor Cohen’s tenure in the early 2000s. Shortly after forming JHMP Jeff also took on artists: Sevendust, Alterbridge, Virgos Merlot and Full Devil Jacket. Jeff Hanson formed JHMP in 1996 and founded, developed and managed Creed on Wind Up records, Virgos Merlot on Atlantic records, Mile on Columbia records, and Full Devil Jacket on Island records. He then released his first independent label release in 2002 under his newly formed Silent Majority Group label with artist Storewide B in a partnership with Gotee / EMI and achieved multiple Christian Rock top 10 hits. As part of his SMG label venture he did A&R; for Island / Def Jam and also did A&R; for Wind Up records where he signed the bands Breaking Point and Dust For Life. In 2003, Jeff's JHMP management company was asked to manage the, then, 14-year-old Hayley Williams Williams was then taken to Atlantic Records and signed to the label by Jason Flom.Jeff Hanson created the first new artist 360 deal together with entertainment lawyers Kent Marcus and Jim Zumwalt between Paramore and Atlantic Records. Paramore. Paramore went on to sell over 5 million records worldwide. His next signings to the company were Mute Math and Family Force 5. He was joined by radio program director Rick Schmidt and fiancée Rebecca Foulke. In 2007 Silent Majority Group entered into an exclusive promotion and distribution deal with Warner Music Group’s Independent Label Group, being distributed by ADA.Jeff Hanson negotiated a deal for Silent Majority Group to be distributed by ADA Global, a Warner Music Group company.Silent Majority Group's first signing there was Framing Hanley received a Platinum certification for their single \\"Lollipop\\". All three of Jeff Hanson's Silent Majority Group signings under the Warner Music Group deal, Tantric, Candlebox, and Framing Hanley went on to have great commercial success and reached sales of over 100,000 albums. As part of Jeff's simultaneous continued association with the CCM sector of the business(Commercial Christian music business) Jeff curated the musical content for Jesus Daily Group, the most interactive Facebook page in the world www.facebook.com/Jesusdaily. At Jesus Daily he A&R;'d two compilations for Jesus Daily Group... \\"an E-Pop Christmas\\" and \\"A Classic Christmas\\" that included numerous established and emerging Christian artists including Wintley Phipps, Charles Billingsley, Everlife, The Tractors, and Gary Chapman. Hanson also produced a two-hour concert special that aired on TBN's 'Praise The Lord\\" to support the compilations. In 2012 Jeff and Paramore EP producer Peter Thornton opened \\"Plush\\" studios in Orlando where he recruited , recorded and developed future multi platinum artist Chris Daughtry. Chris went on to appear on American Idol where he placed 4th and went on to sign with RCA / 19 Records. Later that year Jeff Hanson signed active rock artist Farewell 2 Fear, and rock/pop solo artist Blacklite District to the SMG label and the JHMP management company. Both reached number one on Sirius / XM's \\"Octane\\" Channel. Blacklite District with \\"Take me to the grave\\",\\"With me now\\". and Farewell 2 Fear with \\"Fire\\". Farewell 2 Fear gained popularity when their cover version of Rhianna's \\"Diamonds\\" was featured on the Howard Stern show. Blacklite District has gone on to stream over 100 million streams of different tracks mainly from their multiple associations with Asian Anime Youtube pages. JHMP then signed platinum-selling rock band, Saving Abel, and also helped the act to form their own label Tennessippi Whiskey Records. He next signed the Scranton, PA artist Death Valley Dreams. The first single \\"Words Like Fire\\"appeared on 25 major market alternative stations. The album \\"Lust In The Modern World\\" was selected to appear in numerous playlists on Apple Music and Spotify platforms and was listed as one of the top Rock / Alternative albums of 2016 by Apple Music. In March of 2016 while appearing at the Florida Music Festival as a panelist Jeff Hanson found out that he had been diagnosed with \\"Stage 4/B\\" Metastatic Tonsil cancer that spread to numerous locations and lymph nodes.

He was a prominent lawyer in Christchurch. Early life Wynn-Williams was born in August 1828 in Llangar, Conwy County Borough, North Wales. His father was the rector Peter Williams, and his mother was Lydia Sophia Price. One of his brothers was Watkin. The birth dates for William and Charles are uncertain, as they were apparently born in August and September 1828, respectively *Parish registers of Llangar show Watkin baptised in Sept 1827 & Henry in Sept 1828.Wales Archives Services, Baptism registers of All Saints Church, Llangar Merionethshire: entry 419 1827 & entry 446 1828 His brother Charles studied medicine initially, but changed to a law degree. William was educated in preparation for joining the Indian army, but then also studied law. After practising in Wales for two years, William emigrated to New Zealand, arriving in Wellington in 1856. He worked on farms in the South Island and settled in Christchurch in 1860. Professional career Information board at Ferrymead Heritage Park on Wynn-Williams He began practising law in New Zealand in July 1860 when he joined the practice of Harry Bell Johnstone, who had started his legal firm in January 1859. Johnstone ceased to practice in 1864, but Wynn-Williams remained with the firm until 1912. The firm of Wynn Williams & Co still exists today. He was involved in conveyancing, criminal trials and significant civil litigation. He is described as fearless and often represented the underdog. Political career =Political activism= George Allen was a leader of several protest groups. One such group, the Ratepayers' Mutual Protection Association, challenged the right of the Christchurch City Council to exist. Wynn-Williams was active with the group and took the case to court. Ratepayers started to withhold their rates, and in April 1866 the Council was forced to drastically cut expenditure in order to fend off bankruptcy. Staff were laid off, street cleaning suspended, some streets no longer lit and contracts cancelled. In May 1866, the city drainage scheme was abandoned, a project that had been estimated to cost £160,000. A shipment of pipes that had just arrived from England was sold off, ensuring Christchurch's reputation as the most polluted and unhealthy city for another 20 years. Wynn-Williams eventually lost the lengthy case and left the Ratepayers' Mutual Protection Association, which then folded. =Provincial Council= Wynn-Williams was a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council from 1865 until the abolition of provincial government with one interruption. He represented Heathcote (July 1865 – May 1866), City of Christchurch (June 1866 – November 1870) and Papanui (October 1871 – June 1875). =Member of Parliament= The 10 December 1881 general election in the Heathcote electorate was contested by the incumbent James Fisher, Wynn-Williams and Major Alfred Hornbrook. They received 119, 243 and 167 votes, respectively. Wynn-Williams was thus elected with a majority of 76 votes. Wynn-Williams was an advocate of the working class. Although the Christchurch newspaper The Press was conservative and thus from the opposite end of the political spectrum than Wynn-Williams, they praised him in an editorial on 21 April 1883 for speaking his forthright opinion rather than following the attitude of other politicians of saying what the voters want to hear and what is popular with them: > It gives us a new and a delightful sensation to read the speech he made to > his constituents at Woolston on Thursday evening so free it is from humbug > or deception, and so vigorous with fearless candor. His great-grandson, Robert Wynn-Williams, used the editorial as inspiration for the title of his biography. The nominations for the 1884 general election in the Heathcote electorate took place on 16 July. The 22 July election was contested by the incumbent Wynn-Williams, John Coster and James Fisher. They received 245, 445 and 15 votes, respectively. Coster was thus, with a majority of 200 votes, elected to represent Heathcote in the 9th New Zealand Parliament. Community involvement Wynn-Williams was on the council of the Canterbury Society of Arts, a group organising exhibitions of paintings. In 1881, he was vice-president of that organisation. Death He died on 27 October 1913 and is buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery.

The council is responsible for supporting and managing the participation of Team England at the Commonwealth Games'.  Predecessor  The Commonwealth Games Council for England (CGCE) was originally responsible for 'Team England' and oversaw each team between the 1930 British Empire Games and Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games and the England teams at the Commonwealth Youth Games. Membership of the Games Council consisted of representatives from 26 different sports on the Commonwealth Games' Sports Programme, supported by a small salaried team. CGCE's President was gold medallist Sir Christopher Chataway, the first ever winner of the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year award and a teammate of Sir Roger Bannister.  Present organisation  Following a review in 2009, the Commonwealth Games Council for England was disbanded and a new organisation, Commonwealth Games England, was established in its place. CGE is governed by a board of Non-executive Directors, chaired by Ian Metcalfe. The Board is made up of experts from fields including sport, marketing and finance including England Hockey player Alex Danson and co-founder of Carphone Warehouse and British Olympic Association non-executive director David Ross and National Director at the English Institute of Sport (EIS) Nigel Walker England's gold medal winning heptathlete Denise Lewis was named as President in 2016 and succeeds double gold medal winner Dame Kelly Holmes (2009-2015) and Sir Christopher Chataway.  Funding  Since 1994, the costs of the preparation of Team England have been supported with funding from Sport England, a public body that distributes public and lottery funds. The raising of funds for the team's participation in the Games themselves is the sole responsibility of CGE and is raised through sponsorship and fundraising activities.  Identity  In the run-up to the 2010 Commonwealth Games, CGE adopted a new logo and brand identity. The logo features a single red English lion representing strength, power and performance.

The company was also known as the North British Insurance Company, North British Fire Office and North British Fire Insurance Company. History The company was established after a meeting on 17 April 1809 at the Royal Exchange Coffee House, when a notice was placed in newspapers in Edinburgh announcing a proposal to found a fire insurance company called the North British Insurance Company. A contract of copartnery was issued on 19 October 1809 allowing a capital of £1 million and the new company commenced business on 11 November. In 1823 the company extended its business to include life insurance. The company, successfully trading and growing, was granted a royal charter on 6 February 1824, in the expectation that the permitted capital would be exceeded. In 1862 the company merged with the Mercantile Fire Insurance Company and changed its name to North British & Mercantile Insurance Company. From 1890 until 1996, the company had an arrangement with the Civil Service Insurance Society allowing society members to be insured by North British & Mercantile on special rates. In the 1860s, the company had opened businesses and agencies across the world, including the far east and Africa. North British & Mercantile extended its business to include all marine risks in 1901. Later, through its subsidiaries, general insurance was added. The company's scope continued to grow and, by 1911, it was transacting fire, life, marine, accident, fine art, burglary and motor insurance. In May 1911, the company's burglary and contingency department was transferred to a subsidiary, the Railway Passengers Assurance Company. It was incorporated as a limited company on 1 November 1920 and became a subsidiary of the Commercial Union Assurance Company Ltd in 1959. The company maintained head offices in Edinburgh until 1963 and in London until 1969. Since 30 June 2006 it has been registered as a non-trading company. The company's name continues in a number of its former premises.

The project consisted of people being invited to send postcards from all over Ireland to Doyle and O Reilly Flynn's addresses which were then later displayed in Mullingar Arts Centre in 2007. Background Knowledge of the project spread through word of mouth, internet postings and press releases in local papers. Over 500 cards were received. The project was intended to be accessible to all. Teresa Doyle felt that handwriting was a dying art form, and through this project herself and Edel O Reilly Flynn strived to reawaken it. This small exhibition then travelled to New York, which encouraged a more international group of participants. The project was intended to create a social document of Ireland at the time. Following the initial C Both Sides exhibition, An Post decided to sponsor the ongoing project, which allowed it to reach a wider audience. The launch of An Post C Both Sides, a 12-month project, took place in November 2007 at the Gallery of Photography, Meeting House Square in Temple Bar. It was launched by the Chief Executive of An Post, Donal Connell. Teresa Doyle also made a speech about the beginning of Ireland's largest \\"collaborative art exhibition\\". Workshops Each month of the project's operation had a different theme, which guided the participants when creating a postcard. Workshops were held based on the theme of the month. In July, for example, the theme was prisoners, and a workshop was held in Limerick Prison with some of the inmates. The theme for August was migration, and a workshop was held in Ilac Centre City Library, with a group of migrants. Similar workshops were held throughout the country for other themes. Each month, a celebrity was invited to make a postcard, which was also featured on the website along with a short interview based on the topic of postcards. National project With An Post's sponsorship, the project was rolled out. Each household in Ireland received a blank postcard. The participants were encouraged to consider \\"both sides\\" of the postcard. This highlighted the importance of the recipient and the message as well as the visual aspects of the postcard. In total, over 3,000 submissions were received, of which 250 were chosen by a panel, to be displayed. Helen Carey was the curator of the exhibition. Exhibition The final culmination of a year's work was the opening of the exhibition in the Dublin Civic Offices, on Wood Quay. Travel writer and broadcaster, Manchán Magan opened the exhibition. The postcards were displayed in pigeonholes that used to integral to the sorting of post before the new mechanised sorting machines. The pigeonholes were fitted with clear Perspex frames, which were mounted on a rotating spindle. This allowed the viewer to see \\"both sides\\" of the postcard. This way of displaying the postcards was designed by Fiona Coffey.

Developers work on files in their client workspaces, and check in changed files together in changesets. = Storage = Plastic SCM has 2 different families of storage for all its data and metadata: * Jet: An ad-hoc storage designed for high- performance, released with version 6.0. It is now the default storage. * Relational databases: Traditionally Plastic supported storing all data and metadata in relational databases: MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, SQL Server Compact Edition, Firebird, Firebird Embedded, Postgresql and Oracle. Relational databases are still supported although Jet is now the default option.The story of Jet: Plastic's super-fast repo storage  Modes of operation  Plastic can work in 2 modes: * Centralized: With workspaces (working copies) connected directly to a server. Users perform checkin operations without the need for an additional push step. * Distributed: Users host their own repositories on their computers and push/pull to a central server.Plastic SCM – DVCS at Enterprise Level  Differences with Git  Plastic SCM is not based on Git although it can act as a Git server and a Git client. Differences can be summarized as: improvements in merge, native support for large files and projects, optional file-locking, can work distributed and centralized. There are differences in the branching structure too: while in Git branches are just pointers, in Plastic branches are containers. Plastic versions directories and files identifying them with \\"item ids\\" which is good for move/rename tracking, while Git relies on diffs to rebuild the renames/moves and doesn't version directories.Plastic SCM vs Git — 2018 edition  Interoperability with other version control systems  = Git = Plastic can interoperate with Git in the following ways: * GitSync: Every Plastic client can push and pull from a Git repository.GitSync for Plastic SCM with Native Git Protocols and Visual Studio 2012 Support * GitServer: A Plastic server can act as a Git server, so any git client can push/pull to a Plastic server. * Fast-import/export support: Fast-export and fast-import commands are available to export Plastic repositories to Git intermediate format and import from Git intermediate format.PLASTIC SCM HIGHLIGHTS FOR GIT USERS = Perforce = Plastic can do bi-directional sync with Perforce depots to ease migration[reference: https://www.plasticscm.com/perforce Plastic SCM for Perforce teams] = Other version controls = Import/export from other systems is achieved through Git's fast-import/export format.

They have usually been Toyota-based, or otherwise based on models from the Toyota-owned Hino Motors. The trucks have utilized a cab over engine or mid-engine design. Typically fitted with Toyota engines, a few versions, particularly diesels, received Daihatsu's own engines. The Delta badge was retired in Japan in 2003, but continued to be used on models built locally in other markets until 2010.

The microphone has been described as \\"iconic\\" and a symbol of the BBC.  History  In the early 1930s, the BBC became aware of RCA's model 44 ribbon microphone that was used in Hollywood. Each pair of microphone and amplifier would have cost the BBC £130 (approximately £6,500 in 2009Based on a retail price index calculation ). As this was not within the BBC's budget, they designed their own microphone, the Type A, alongside Marconi. There were initial concerns that the new design infringed the patent of the RCA microphone, but these were overcome. The Type A was produced at a cost of £9 each (approximately £475 in 2009). The original Type A microphone was designed by engineer F W Alexander under the guidance of H L Kirke's Research Department at the BBC. In 1940, the Type A was used in the broadcast of Charles de Gaulle's 1940 appeals. In the early 1950s, the BBC began to design the Type A's successor. The first model was the pressure gradient PGD design. In 1953, production began on the PGS (pressure gradient single) ribbon microphone in agreement with Standard Telephones and Cables (STC). In the mid-1970s, STC's manufacturing was transferred to Coles Electroacoustics, who continue to manufacture the PGS under the model number 4038.  Technical  Four versions of the microphone were produced - the \\"A\\", \\"AX\\", \\"AXB\\", and \\"AXBT\\". The original microphone used a thick aluminium ribbon which produced a harsh resonance. This was soon replaced with a thinner ribbon, and was named Type AX. In 1943, the AXB model was launched, which featured balanced wiring. In 1944, the microphone was renamed the AXBT with the addition of a Ticonal magnet to increase sensitivity by 6 decibels. The AXBT weighed approximately . The microphone had a figure-of-eight polar pattern. The aluminium ribbon was less than one micrometre thick.

Life One of the eighteen children of Francis Quarles, Quarles may have been born in Essex in 1624. He was educated under the care of Archbishop James Ussher. Quarles matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 9 February 1643, but does not seem to have taken a degree. During the English Civil War, Quarles joined the Royalist cause and served as a soldier at the garrison at Oxford, England. After the Parliamentarian victory, Quarles was first imprisoned and later banished from England. While in banishment in Flanders he wrote the poems contained in his first published volume, Fons Lachrymarum. Quarles was back in England in 1648, but his \\"occasions beyond sea\\" compelled him to leave again in 1649. The date of his final return to England is unknown. Towards the end of his life Quarles became impoverished, surviving off his literary work. In 1665, he died during the Great Plague of London. Works The published works of Quarles are: * Fons Lachrymarum, or a Fountain of Tears; from whence flow England's Complaint, Jeremiahs Lamentations paraphras'd, with Divine Meditations. And an Elegy upon that Son of Valor, Sir Charles Lucas, London, 1648; reprinted 1649, 1655, 1677. * Regale Lectum Miseriæ, or a Kingly Bed of Miserie.

There is nothing in the book to show that this last item, a translation entirely in the manner of Quarles, is a posthumous publication, but the date of his death given above is confirmed by William Winstanley, who was apparently acquainted with at least one member of his family.

The stream runs along a geological fault line through dolomite and limestone, and is fed along its course by springs. Currently, Mekorot (the national water company) pumps the water of the stream's springs, and has been accused of causing the stream to dry up.
