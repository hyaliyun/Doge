It can also be read in American Gothic Tales edited by Joyce Carol Oates and Sudden Fiction edited by Richard Shapard. It is the story of a man with an unwavering need for more than just love: he wants to possess and be possessed. Determined to do so, he goes to an extreme only to learn there can only be desire: \\"He walked around on his skinned feet, leaving bloody footprints up and down the corridors, looking for someone to love him.\\"\\"The Anatomy of Desire Plot summary The story of Hanley is told in third-person narrative. An event which forever changes his life is explained in detail. Hanley was the unfortunate soldier that had been caught by the enemy while sleeping. The general was very fond of Hanley when he was brought to him. He felt that Hanley could be his own son, but nevertheless, he still had to perform his duty. In the morning it was time for Hanley to be punished. He would serve as an example of what happened to infiltrators. The enemy proceeded in flaying Hanley's skin, sparing his face and genitals as the general had requested. His skin was then hung on the barbed wire and he was left for dead. When morning arrived, the enemy had retreated and Hanley was rescued and then sent to the veteran 's hospital. This was a lonely time for Hanley. No one wanted to be near him, except if they were obligated, because of his condition. Here Hanley met the nurse called the saint. She was a loving woman who when asked by Hanley if she would love him, agreed. Hanley eventually revealed he did not just want her to love him; he wanted to be possessed by her. The saint would tell Hanley how handsome he was, how much she needed him, and how she could not live without him. This went on for quite some time, but it was not enough for Hanley. \\"I am in love and I am loved, Why isn't this enough?\\" Hanley wanted to be surrounded by the saint; to be enclosed by her. That night they made love, but it still was not enough for Hanley. During this time, Hanley was receiving letters from the general. He felt remorse for what he did to Hanley, but still explained he had to do his duty. In the final letter, the general revealed he could no longer endure it and that he was possessed by Hanley. One day Hanley finally realized what he wanted and told the saint that he wanted her skin. The saint allowed him to do so only slightly shivering from the cold blade of the knife. Surprisingly, the saint felt satisfied about it. He spared her face and genitals as were his. After a week went by and the skin had dried, Hanley put on the skin. He walked the corridors and left no bloody trails. \\"Thank you\\" he told the saint, \\"It is my heart's desire fulfilled. I am inside you. I am possessed by you.\\" When he looked into the saint's loving eyes, he finally realized what had occurred. He could never truly be possessed, he could only desire the feeling. \\"He plucked at his empty skin, and wept.\\" References Category:American short stories Category:1981 short stories Category:Gothic short stories ","title":"The Anatomy of Desire"},{"id":"23882970","text":"Adenosinergic means \\"working on adenosine\\".

Early life Rev. Dr. R. H. Boyd and family Boyd was born into slavery at the B. A. Gray plantation in Noxubee County, Mississippi, on March 15, 1843. He was one of ten children of his mother, Indiana Dixon.In the 1901 book Sermons, addresses and reminiscences and important correspondence, with a picture gallery of eminent ministers and scholars, E. C. Morris reported Boyd's birthplace as \\"Winton County, Mississippi\\" (possibly a mistaken rendering of Winston County) and his birthdate as only \\"the month of March.\\" He was originally named Dick Gray, having been given the surname of his slave master.Nolan Thompson, Boyd, Richard Henry, in Handbook of Texas OnlineLois C. McDougald, Richard Henry Boyd , in A Profile of African Americans in Tennessee History, 1995; retrieved from Tennessee State University website, August 8, 2009 As a child, he moved twice with his master's household, to Lowndes County, Mississippi in 1848, and to Claiborne Parish, Louisiana in 1853.Joe Early, Jr., Richard Henry Boyd: Shaper of Black Baptist Identity, Baptist History and Heritage, Summer-Fall, 2007 In 1859 he was sold to Benoni W. Gray, who took him to a cotton plantation near Brenham in Washington County, Texas. During the American Civil War, he served Gray as a bodyservant in the Confederate Army. After Gray and his two eldest sons were killed and a third son was badly wounded in fighting near Chattanooga, Tennessee, Boyd returned to Texas with the surviving son. In Texas, he took over management of the Gray plantation, successfully producing and selling cotton. Following emancipation, he also worked as a cowboy and in a sawmill. In 1867, he changed his name to Richard Henry Boyd; Richard (\\"Dick\\") had been his grandfather's first name, but there is no record of the reasons for his choice of his new middle name and surname. After emancipation, Boyd, who did not learn the alphabet until age 22, began a process of self-education. He used Webster's Blue-Backed Speller and McGuffey's First Reader as texts and hired a white girl to teach him. In about 1869 or 1870 he enrolled in Bishop College in Marshall, Texas, an American Baptist Home Mission Society school for the education of freed slaves. He attended Bishop for two years, but did not graduate. Later in life he received honorary doctoral degrees from Guadalupe College and Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical State College. In 1868, Boyd married Laura Thomas, who died less than a year later. In 1871 he married Harriett Albertine Moore.  Religious career  In 1869 Boyd was baptized in Hopewell Baptist Church in Navasota, Texas. Shortly thereafter, he felt called to the ministry and was ordained as a minister in 1871. Subsequently, he served as a pastor to several Texas churches, including the Nineveh Baptist Church in Grimes City, the Union Baptist Church in Palestine, and the Mount Zion Baptist Church in San Antonio, and helped to organize other churches in Palestine (including South Union Missionary Baptist Church), Waverly, Old Danville, Navasota, and Crockett. In 1870 he helped organize the first black Baptist association in Texas, the Texas Negro Baptist Convention, and served as its missionary and educational secretary from 1870 to 1874. In 1876 he represented black Texas Baptists at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. While in Texas, Boyd became concerned that the Sunday school materials and other publications of the Southern Baptist Convention and American Baptist Publication Society, which were produced by white people, did not meet the needs of African American Baptists. He became interested in publishing black-authored materials for use in churches and Sunday schools. Because this view was not shared by all members of the Texas Negro Baptist Convention, in 1893 Boyd left that association to form the General Missionary Baptist Convention of Texas. In 1894 and 1895 he produced his first pamphlets for use in black Baptist Sunday schools. At the 1895 annual meeting of National Baptist Convention in St. Louis, Missouri, he pressed for the creation of a publishing board for the black Baptists and received the support of Elias C. Morris, president of the National Baptist Convention. In 1896 he resigned from his church positions in Texas and moved to Nashville to establish the National Baptist Publishing Board, arriving there on November 7, 1896.Company History, R. H. Boyd Publishing Corporation website =National Baptist Publishing Board= Boyd did not have National Baptist Convention financial support to start the Publishing Board, so he financed its establishment himself, using real estate in Texas that he owned as collateral, and received assistance with printing from the white Southern Baptist Convention, which had its main publishing operations in Nashville. The National Baptist Publishing Board fulfilled Boyd's goal of providing black Baptists with religious materials written by other black Baptists, primarily periodicals and Sunday School materials, but also including some books. At the beginning, the Publishing Board took over responsibility for publishing the National Baptist Magazine and it launched the new Teacher's Monthly in 1897. The Publishing Board started making a profit as early as the first quarter of 1897, when it distributed more than 180,000 copies of published materials, and it grew increasingly profitable over time. In 1898, in collaboration with nine other men, Boyd incorporated the National Baptist Publishing Board under a Tennessee state charter. Under the charter, the Publishing Board was owned by Boyd and governed by a self- perpetuating board of trustees.Paul Harvey (2009) Richard Henry Boyd (1855-1922) in the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture The National Baptist Publishing Board became the principal source of religious publications for black Baptists worldwide. By 1906, it was the largest African American publishing company in the United States. The business employed as many as 110 workers. In its first 18 years, it issued more than 128 million periodicals. It is credited with being the first publisher of the old songs of Negro slaves, and it produced more than 25 songbooks and hymnals by 1921, including Golden Gems: A Song Book for the Church Choir, the Pew, and Sunday School (1901) and The National Baptist Hymnal (1903). The board's publications are considered to have played a key role in establishing an African American Baptist religious and racial identity in the United States.Clyde McQueen (2000) Black Churches in Texas, Texas A&M; University Press. , . Page 17. =Splitting of the National Baptist Convention= In 1915 the success of the Publishing Board under Boyd's leadership led to a split within the National Baptist Convention. Pastors and other leaders within the convention were suspicious of the Publishing Board and sought greater control, while Boyd asserted that the Publishing Board was independent. Boyd, who served as the National Baptist Convention secretary of missions from 1896 to 1914 while also leading the Publishing Board, claimed that the Publishing Board regularly contributed some of its profits to the missionary work of the National Baptist Convention, but this was disputed.Dr. Wilson Fallin, Jr., History of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. , National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. website, accessed August 10, 2009 Following confrontations at the annual meeting of the National Baptist Convention in Chicago in 1915, Boyd and his supporters formed the National Baptist Convention of America, which became known informally as \\"National Baptist Convention, Unincorporated,\\" and was sometimes derisively called the \\"Boyd National Convention.\\"NBCA History, National Baptist Convention of America, Inc. website, accessed August 12, 2009 The leaders remaining in the original convention incorporated in 1916, adopting the name National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. sued unsuccessfully to obtain ownership of the Publishing Board and subsequently created its own Sunday School publishing board. Other business activities Boyd's business interests extended beyond the Publishing Board. The National Baptist Church Supply Company, which he established in 1902, sold a diverse range of supplies for churches, including pews, fans, pulpits, and pipe organs. Another of his business activities was design and sale of African American dolls. His National Negro Doll Company is believed to have pioneered the marketing of black dolls for black children for the purpose of black pride. Boyd started selling black dolls imported from Europe in 1908, after experiencing difficulty finding suitable dolls for he children in his family. In 1911 his National Negro Doll Company began to manufacture dolls. He was quoted as contrasting his dolls with Negro dolls then produced by white-owned businesses, saying: \\"These dolls are not made of that disgraceful and humiliating type that we have grown accustomed to seeing Negro dolls made of. They represent the intelligent and refined Negro of the day, rather than the type of toy that is usually given to children and, as a rule, used as a scarecrow.\\" The doll company was not profitable, and the company ceased operations around 1915. In Nashville, he was one of the founders and first president of the One-Cent Savings and Trust Company Bank, a bank expressly intended to serve the financial needs of African American depositors who believed that white-owned banks looked down on their small deposits. Although the minimum deposit was actually 10 cents, the name \\"One- Cent\\" was chosen to emphasize that every customer was important, no matter how little money they had. The bank, which opened its doors in 1904 and reported assets of $80,000 as of 1912, was still in business as of 2009 as the Citizens Savings Bank and Trust Company.Linda T. Wynn, Citizens Savings Bank and Trust Company, in A Profile of African Americans in Tennessee History, 1995; retrieved from Tennessee State University website, August 8, 2009 Civil rights activities Boyd was a public advocate for African American civil rights. As early as the 1890s he voiced his concern that whites planned to reverse the civil rights gains that African Americans had made in the years after the Civil War, and in subsequent years he worked against the Jim Crow laws enacted to enforce segregation. =Nashville streetcar boycott= After the Tennessee General Assembly enacted a 1905 law to segregate Nashville's streetcar system, local black leaders were determined to protest the law through a boycott of the public transportation system. When the law first went into effect in July, the boycott was effective, as few blacks were riding streetcars. Boyd, then head of the local chapter of the National Negro Business League, joined with other prominent citizens to promote and formalize the boycott. Because many blacks needed the streetcar system to travel to and from work, it proved difficult to maintain participation in the boycott. To help their fellow black citizens avoid using Nashville's public streetcars, Boyd joined with lawyer James C. Napier and funeral home director Preston Taylor to establish a rival black-owned public transit system, the Union Transportation Company. The new company began service on September 29, 1905, operating five steam buses. These vehicles lacked the power needed to climb some of the city's hills, so the company acquired a fleet of 14 electric buses. To avoid buying electricity from a white-owned utility, the transportation company powered the buses with a generator in the basement of the Publishing Board building. The company had limited financial resources, was not able to effectively meet the transportation needs of Nashville's geographically dispersed black population, and was handicapped by a tax on electric streetcars that the city of Nashville enacted in 1906 specifically to combat the black-owned business. The Union Transportation Company went out of business within a year, by which time the boycott had been largely abandoned. Although the boycott was ultimately unsuccessful, its long duration was one source of inspiration for bus boycotts in the 1950s.Paul Harvey, Richard Henry Boyd: Black Business and Religion in the Jim Crow South, pages 51-67 in Portraits of African American Life Since 1865, Nina Mjagkij, editor, 2003.

Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962),. was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States interpreted Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)Fed. R. Civ. P. 15. to require that federal courts grant a party leave to amend a pleading absent special circumstances such as bad faith or prejudice to the opposing party. It has been recognized by both other courtsSee, e.g., Gardner v. So. Ry. Sys. , 675 F.2d 949 (7th Cir. 1982). and secondary sources6 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure ¬ß 1487 (2d ed. 1990). as a leading decision on the interpretation of Rule 15(a). Background Foman's father allegedly promised her he would not execute a will in exchange for Foman caring for her mother until her mother's death. After her mother died, Foman's father married Davis, and, contrary to the alleged promise, executed a will leaving his entire estate to Davis. Following her father's death, Foman filed suit against Davis in the District of Massachusetts to recover what would have been her intestate share of her father's estate, that is, the amount she would have gotten had he not executed a will, as he allegedly promised. Davis moved to dismiss the case, arguing that, under Massachusetts law, an oral promise not to execute a will was within the statute of frauds and thus unenforceable. The district court agreed and dismissed the case. Foman appealed the judgment to the First Circuit. Soon after appealing, though, Foman moved the district court for an order vacating the judgment and granting her leave to amend her complaint to assert a new cause of action for quantum meruit. The district court denied these motions, and Foman appealed this denial to the First Circuit. On appeal, the First Circuit held that it was unable to consider the merits of the case because Foman moved to vacate the judgment subsequent to her first appeal, meaning the judgment was not \\"final.\\" The First Circuit then upheld the district court's denial of Foman's motions to vacate the judgment and amend her complaint. The Supreme Court agreed to review the case. Opinion of the Court Justice Goldberg, writing for the Court, began by holding that the First Circuit was wrong to find that it could not consider the merits of the case because Foman moved to vacate the judgment after filing her initial appeal. Instead, the First Circuit should have considered the merits at the same time as the motions to vacate and amend. The Court then turned to the First Circuit's denial of Foman's motion to amend her complaint. Under Rule 15(a), federal courts \\"should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\\" In the Court's view, this meant that the standard for granting leave to amend was quite liberal: only in very limited circumstances would a denial of leave to amend be justified. Specifically, the Court found that undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendment, prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of amendment would support a denial. Absent such special circumstances, it would be an abuse of discretion for a court to deny leave to amend. The Court granted Foman's motion to amend her complaint and remanded the case to the First Circuit for proceedings consistent with its opinion. =Concurrence/Dissent= The second Justice Harlan, writing for himself and Justice White, issued a two-sentence opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Harlan agreed that the First Circuit should have considered the merits of Foman's case, but he believed the question of whether Foman should have been allowed to amend her complaint was best left to the lower courts. Subsequent Developments On remand, the First Circuit considered the merits of Foman's case, as the Supreme Court had directed. It overturned the district court, ruling that under Massachusetts law, an oral promise not to execute a will was not rendered unenforceable by the statute of frauds. Accordingly, the First Circuit had no need to consider Foman's quantum meruit argument.

Life  Leonid Mandelstam was born in Mogilev, Russian Empire (now Belarus). He studied at the Novorossiya University in Odessa, but was expelled in 1899 due to political activities, and continued his studies at the University of Strasbourg. He remained in Strasbourg until 1914, and returned with the beginning of World War I. He was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1942. Mandelstam died in Moscow, USSR (now Russia).  Scientific achievements  The main emphasis of his work was broadly considered theory of oscillations, which included optics and quantum mechanics. He was a co-discoverer of inelastic combinatorial scattering of light used now in Raman spectroscopy (see below). This paradigm-altering discovery (together with G. S. Landsberg) had occurred at the Moscow State University just one week earlier than a parallel discovery of the same phenomena by C. V. Raman and K. S. Krishnan. In Russian literature it is called \\"combinatorial scattering of light\\" (from combination of frequencies of photons and molecular vibrations) but in English it is named after Raman. = Discovery of the combinatorial scattering of light = In 1918, Mandelstam theoretically predicted the fine structure splitting in Rayleigh scattering due to light scattering on thermal acoustic waves. Beginning from 1926, Mandelstam and Landsberg initiated experimental studies on vibrational scattering of light in crystals at the Moscow State University. As a result of this research, Landsberg and Mandelstam discovered the effect of the combinatorial scattering of light on 21 February 1928. They presented this fundamental discovery for the first time at a colloquium on 27 April 1928. They published brief reports about this discovery (experimental results with some attempt at a theoretical explanation) in RussianG.S. Landsherg, L.I. Mandelstam, \\"New phenomenon in scattering of light (preliminary report)\\", Journal of the Russian Physico-Chemical Society, Physics Section 60, 335 (1928). and in German and then published a comprehensive paper in Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik. In the same year, two Indian scientists C. V. Raman and K. S. Krishnan also observed the inelastic scattering of light. Raman stated that \\"The line spectrum of the new radiation was first seen on 28 February 1928\\". Thus, combinatorial scattering of light was observed by Mandelstam and Landsberg a week earlier than by Raman and Krishnan. However, according to the Physics Nobel Committee, Mandelstam and Landsberg were unable to provide an independent, complete interpretation for the discovery, as they only later cited Raman's article. Also, their observations were limited to crystals, whereas Raman and Krishnan showed the effect in solids, liquids, and vapors, thus proving the universal nature of the effect. Raman's method was further applied with great success in different fields of molecular physics, for example in the composition analysis of liquids, gases, and solids, and provided significant insight on nuclear spins. Hence, the light-scattering phenomenon became known as Raman scattering or the Raman effect.

Present-day Erie Canal near Rochester, New York A long-distance trail (or long-distance footpath, track, way, greenway) is a longer recreational trail mainly through rural areas used for hiking, backpacking, cycling, horse riding or cross-country skiing. They exist on all continents except Antarctica. Many trails are marked on maps. Typically, a long-distance route will be at least long, but many run for several hundred miles, or longer. Many routes are waymarked and may cross public or private land and/or follow existing rights of way. Generally, the surface is not specially prepared, and the ground can be rough and uneven in areas, except in places such as converted rail tracks or popular walking routes where stone-pitching and slabs have been laid to prevent erosion. In some places, official trails will have the surface specially prepared to make the going easier.  Historically  Historically, and still nowadays in countries where most people move on foot or with pack animals, long-distance trails linked far away towns and regions. Such paths followed \\"logical\\" routes, that can be approximated to least-cost paths.Nyssen, J., Tesfaalem Ghebreyohannes, Hailemariam Meaza, Dondeyne, S., 2020.

Hiking trails =Europe= GR footpaths are long-distance footpaths in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal (the Grande Randonn√©e (French), Grote Routepaden or Lange- afstand-wandelpaden (Dutch), Grande Rota (Portuguese) or Gran Recorrido (Spanish)). United Kingdom National Trails are a network of officially sanctioned footpaths in the United Kingdom which are well maintained and well waymarked across England and Wales. Examples are the Pennine Way and the South West Coast Path. The equivalent routes in Scotland are styled as Scotland's Great Trails; they include the West Highland Way and the Speyside Way. Republic of Ireland The Kerry Way in south-west Ireland circumnavigates the highest mountain range in Ireland. Along with the adjoining Dingle Way it is noted for its scenic views of the Atlantic, loughs and mountains.

These follow coastlines; examples are the Brittany Coast Path in France, the California Coastal Trail in the US, the South West Coast Path in England, the East Coast Trail in Canada, and the Otter Trail in South Africa. The England Coast Path, in development by Natural England, will be around long. It is expected to open in 2020 as the longest coastal walking route in the world and Britain's longest National Trail. Coast-to-coast trails These may be cross-country paths, or may follow roads or other ways, and often intersect with many other trails. Examples are Wainwright's Coast-to-Coast path in northern England, and the GR 10 in France. The English Coast to Coast route, despite being amongst the best-known long- distance walking routes in England, is not an official National Trail, but simply a series of connected pre-existing rights of way, roads and open country with some informal links between them. There is also a coast-to-coast mountain-bike route in northern England that has the same trailheads as the walkers' path. GR 10 is a French GR footpath that runs the length of the Pyrenees Mountains, roughly paralleling the French‚ÄìSpanish border on the French side. It runs west to east, from Hendaye on the Bay of Biscay to Banyuls-sur-Mer on the Mediterranean Sea. The American Discovery Trail is a hiking and biking trail that crosses the continental United States from east to west, across the mid-tier of the United States . Horses can also be ridden on most of this trail. The eastern terminus is the Delmarva Peninsula on the Atlantic Ocean and the western terminus is Point Reyes, on the northern California coast at the Pacific Ocean.

It is long, with 342 day stages. Circular routes include the Tour du Mont Blanc, which passes through the Alps of France, Switzerland, and Italy. In the Balkans region, the Peaks of the Balkans Trail and High Scardus Trail connect Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro or North Macedonia respectively through a network of combined almost . =United States= In the United States, notable linear trails include the Appalachian Trail, , the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail,. The first long-distance hiking trail in the US was begun in 1910 and named The Long Trail. Notable circular trails include the Tahoe Rim Trail and the Wonderland Trail (which encircles Mount Rainier). =Australia= The Australian Alps Walking Track traverses the alpine areas of Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. It is long, starting at Walhalla, Victoria, and running through to Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory near Canberra. =Himalayas= The Himalayan routes are famous for attracting a large number of trekkers (backpackers). Typical trekking regions in Nepal are Annapurna, Dolpo, Langtang, Manaslu, Kangchenjunga and Mount Everest. In India, the Kashmir Valley is home to several trekking routes that traverse western sections of the Himalayas. Vishansar Lake, Gangabal Lake and Tarsar Lakes are accessible only through different trekking routes. Other popular trekking routes in India include Chandra Taal, Dzongri, Goechala, Gomukh, Hemkund, Kafni Glacier, Kailash-Manasarovar, Kedarnath, Kedartal, Milam Glacier, Nanda Devi Sanctuary, Pindari Glacier, Richenpong, Roopkund, Sar Pass, Satopanth Tal, Saurkundi Pass and the Valley of Flowers. The Great Himalaya Trail is proposed to follow the Greater Himalaya Range from Namche Barwa in Tibet to Nanga Parbat in Pakistan, forming the world's highest mountain trail. =Andes= A long-distance trail network in the southern Andes, the Greater Patagonian Trail, was first described in 2014. It currently connects Santiago de Chile with the Southern Patagonian Icefield and explores the remote areas of the Patagonian Andes in the border region between Chile and Argentina. The entire network currently incorporates more than of routes and provides many packrafting options. =Eastern Africa= * Kilimandjaro in Tanzania * Simien Mountains in Ethiopia * Dogu'a Tembien in Ethiopia Footbridge along trail 16 in Dogu'a Tembien Other types =Cycling= These routes have been constructed mainly for bicycle touring. Some are restricted to use by only non-motorized bikes while others are multi-use recreational (i.e. hiking, horseback riding, jogging, rollerblading or walking). Some long-distance cycling routes are hundreds of miles long, such as Australia's mainly off-road Munda Biddi Trail, or even thousands of miles, such as the EuroVelo routes. =Canal towpaths= Some trails follow the towpaths of canal systems. A good example is the New York State Canal System in New York. There also numerous routes that can be followed in Europe, which may be suitable for walkers, cyclists, horse riders and canoeists. =Equestrian= High Peak Trail, part of the Pennine Bridleway in northern England Many long-distance trails have sections suitable for equestrians, and a few are suitable for horse riding throughout their length, or have been developed primarily for horse riding. The Bicentennial National Trail (BNT) in Australia is the longest marked multi-use trail in the world, stretching from Cooktown, Queensland, through New South Wales to Healesville, Victoria. This non-motorised trail runs the length of the rugged Great Dividing Range through national parks and private property and alongside wilderness areas. One of the objectives was to develop a trail that linked up the brumby tracks,The Bicentennial National Trail, Welcome to One of the World's Great Natural Adventures mustering and stock routes along the Great Dividing Range, thus allowing one legally to ride the routes of stockmen and drovers who once traveled these areas with pack horses. The Bicentennial National Trail is suitable for self-reliant horse riders, fit walkers and mountain bike riders. In the United Kingdom, the British Horse Society is developing a network of horse trails known as the National Bridleroute Network. A number of long-distance multi-use trails have been created in England, including three National Trails: the Pennine Bridleway, , The Ridgeway, , and the South Downs Way, .Ride-UK: National Bridle Route Network provides details of other long distance bridle routes at http://www.ride-uk.org.uk. =Rail trails= Rail trails (or rail paths) are shared-use paths that make use of abandoned railway corridors. There are also rails with trails in the USA that follow working rail tracks. Most rail trails have a gravel or dirt surface and can be used for walking, cycling, and often horse riding as well. The following description comes from Australia, but is applicable to other rail trails that exist throughout the world: East Gippsland Rail Trail signage in Victoria, Australia indicating the shared trail usage In the US, the Cheshire Rail Trail, in New Hampshire, can be used by hikers, horseback riders, snowmobilers, cross-country skiers, cyclists, or even dog-sledders. In Canada, following the abandonment of the Prince Edward Island Railway in 1989, the government of Prince Edward Island purchased the right-of-way to the entire railway system. The Confederation Trail was developed as a tip-to-tip walking and cycling gravel rail trail which doubles as a monitored and groomed snowmobile trail during the winter months, operated by the PEI Snowmobile Association.

It is located about northwest of Vilnius near the Vilnius‚ÄìPanevƒó≈æys highway. According to the 2011 census, it had population of 1,636. History Mai≈°iagala, first mentioned in 1254, is one of the earliest Lithuanian settlements. It had a large defensive castle, which was part of the defensive network around Vilnius against the Teutonic Knights. The wooden castle was destroyed in 1365, but was rebuilt. According to Jan D≈Çugosz, Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas died in this castle in 1377. After the Christianization of Lithuania in 1387, Mai≈°iagala was one of the seven towns in Lithuania where a Catholic church was built. In 1390, during the Lithuanian Civil War of 1389‚Äì1392, the castle was burned down and was not rebuilt. The town continued to exist, growing as a trading center, and was granted city privileges sometime in mid-16th century. Its coat of arms depicted Saint Anthony of Padua. At the time it was a royal city and King of Poland Sigismund I the Old built a castle for his Italian wife Bona Sforza. Therefore, the old hill fort is sometimes known as Bona's Hill. Sigismund also reconstructed the town church. After extinction of the Jagiellon dynasty, Mai≈°iagala lost its status as royal summer residence and began to decline. It became property of various nobles: first Sapieha, then Tyzenhaus family. In 1805 the Houvalt family bought the town from heirs of Ignacy Massalski, Bishop of Vilnius. They built a manor, which now houses a school, in the Classical style. After World War I, the town was a target of clashes in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War. After ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny in 1920, it became part of the Republic of Central Lithuania (1920‚Äì1922), which merged into the Second Polish Republic in 1922. After the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty of 1939, Lithuania acquired the town. Among its natives was the great Jewish philosopher Rabbi David (\\"the Nazirite\\") Cohen.

This motorised vessel (MV) was built in 1972, and began sailing the Tongan route on 7 July 2009 only to sink less than a month later on 5 August. Official figures released by Operation Ashika on 19 August 2009, confirmed that 54 men were rescued, and 74 people were lost at sea. These include two bodies recovered and 72 missing (68 passengers and 4 crew), including five foreign nationals. Two of the missing passengers remain unidentified.Tribute ‚Äì list of casualties ‚Äì Matangi Tonga Tonga's transportation minister, Paul Karalus, resigned six days after the tragedy.  History The ferry was laid down in June 1972 and completed on 27 September 1972 at the Shikoku Dockyard in Takamatsu, Japan, and was named MV Olive Maru No. 1. In 1985, she was renamed MV Princess Ashika after the only daughter of a Fijian operator named Raj Naidu who operated a shipping company named North West Shipping and who imported the ship to Fiji in 1985 from Nagasaki, Japan. In 1989 and after the initial coup era in Fiji, Mr Naidu sold the ship to the Patterson Brothers Shipping Company Limited who continued to operate this ship for the following 20 years prior to it being sold to the Tongan government. Due to concerns by the Tongan government over the physical status and safety of the existing inter-island ferry, the MV Olovaha,Cabinet Concerned about Status of MV Olovaha , Prime Minister of Tonga, 12 November 2008. the Princess Ashika was ordered from Fiji to replace the Olovaha at which time it was purchased by Shipping Corporation of Polynesia Ltd. The use of the Princess Ashika was intended to be a stop-gap measure until a new boat funded by a NZD$35 million grant from Japan was to replace it in 2011.Dozens missing after Tongan ferry sinks, WA Today, 6 August 2009. Shipping Corporation of Polynesia Ltd had stated less than two months before the disaster that the ship was in \\"good\\" condition and that it had been well maintained. = Sinking = The ferry was travelling from the capital of Tonga, Nuku ªalofa, to Ha'afeva when it sent out a mayday call just before 2300 hours on 5 August 2009, followed by a distress beacon. The distress beacon was sent five minutes after the mayday call. One survivor described a \\"big wave\\" and \\"much water\\", claiming that it had happened very quickly. When it sank, the ferry had only made five voyages in its new role. A P-3 Orion plane from the Royal New Zealand Air Force located a trail of wreckage northeast of Nuku ªalofa. When darkness fell, search boats ceased searching for fear of sailing over survivors in the water. Due to the possibility that stowaways may have been onboard it is impossible to confirm a precise number of passengers. One 48-year-old British national was killed, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He was resident in New Zealand at the time of his death. There were said to be around ten Europeans on board the ferry. An ROV operated from HMNZS Manawanui returned photos of the wreck on 18 August 2009. = Unseaworthiness = John Jonesse, managing director of the Shipping Corporation of Polynesia Ltd. inspected the ship in Fiji before it was brought to Tonga.TNews Episode 18, 11 August 2009 Princess Ashika was inspected by government surveyors and approved for inter- island ferry services.

The Royal Commission was required to enquire and report upon : # The facts about the disaster and the accompanying search, rescue and recovery of the disaster victims; # The cause of the disaster; # Evidence leading to any criminal act contributing to the disaster; # Evidence leading to any civil responsibility for the disaster; # The reasons why the loss of lives attained such magnitude; # Present proposals for any measures that would help to prevent the future occurrence of a similar disaster, or may assist in future search, rescue and recovery of disaster victims. At an early hearing of the Royal Commission, former general manager and Director of SCP, marine engineer Mosese Fakatou, presented 37 slides showing holes and heavy corrosion in the sides and floor of Princess Ashika. Mr Fakatou had been instructed by P&I; insurers British Marine to conduct a Loss Prevention Survey, however, delays in carrying out the survey meant that the survey was written up on 6 and 7 August, after the vessel had sunk.Engineer shows photos of holes on sides and floor of Ashika The inquiry later found that Princess Ashika had not been surveyed prior to being purchased by the Tongan government and that unfavourable surveys by the Fiji Marine Board were not brought to the attention of the Tongan authorities. A survey was conducted by Tongan Ministry of Transport surveyors on arrival of the vessel in Tonga, however, despite their subsequent claims that they considered the vessel to be totally unseaworthy, they failed to stop operations of the vessel.Full transcripts of the hearings of the Royal Commission of Enquiry See also *2009 Kiribati ferry accident *List of maritime disasters References External links *Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Sinking of the MV Princess Ashika *Matangi Tonga: SCP releases ferry disaster survivor list *Matangi Tonga: 93 missing, Ashika toll rising (including Survivor list) Category:2009 in Tonga Category:Maritime incidents in 2009 Category:Maritime incidents in Tonga Category:Ships built in Japan Category:Ferries Category:1972 ships Category:Shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean Category:August 2009 events in Oceania ","title":"MV Princess Ashika"},{"id":"23883195","text":"Methylenedioxyphenylpropanone (C10H10O3) can refer to: * MDP1P * MDP2P ","title":"Methylenedioxyphenylpropanone"},{"id":"23883197","text":"Golden burial mask of Rhescuporis VI. Tiberius Julius Rhescuporis VI (; died 342) was the last ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom, a client realm of the Roman Empire. His royal title on coins is in Greek: ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïŒ©Œ£ Œ°ŒóŒ£ŒöŒüŒ•Œ†ŒüŒ°ŒôŒîŒüŒ£ or of King Rhescuporis. He ruled from 303 until his death in 342, and was a contemporary to the Tetrarchy and the Constantinian dynasty in Rome. Little is known of his life and reign. Rhescuporis VI was the first-born son to the Bosporan King Theothorses; the name of his mother is unknown. He was of Greek, Iranian and Roman ancestry, and was named in honor of Rhescuporis V, his paternal great-grandfather and a previous Bosporan King. His younger brother was prince Rhadamsades. In 303, Rhescuporis VI became co-ruler with his father, Theothorses. When Theothorses died around 308/309, Rhescuporis VI's brother Rhadamsades succeeded their father and became co-ruler with him. During his and his brother's co-rule, various metals were used including brass to create and mint coins in the Bosporus. When Rhadamsades died in 323, Rhescuporis VI became the sole and last ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom. The King of the Goths, Ermanaric conquered the Bosporan Kingdom, killing Rhescuporis VI and subjecting the kingdom and the citizens to his rule. Rhescuporis VI was buried in a royal tomb in Panticapaeum, the original capital city of the Bosporan Kingdom.

Nobody expected much out of the Beavers in 1967; even the Oregon State media guide said that the Beavers would be \\"rebuilding\\" in 1967. Quarterback Paul Brothers, who led Oregon State to the Rose Bowl as a sophomore after the 1964 season, and fullback Pete Pifer, the Beavers' all-time leading rusher, had graduated. The starting quarterback was junior Steve Preece, the wunderkind Andros had recruited from Boise, Idaho, shortly after he arrived at Oregon State. Another newcomer on offense was junior fullback Bill \\"Earthquake\\" Enyart, who previously backed up Pifer. Too talented to keep off the field, Enyart had earned All-Coast honors at linebacker in 1966. The 1967 team only boasted six seniors. =Stanford= Stanford made their first trip to Portland, Oregon, in 12 years. Oregon State and Stanford met for the first time since the Indians almost derailed the Beavers' 1965 Rose Bowl trip. Oregon State entered the game a one-point favorite. In the second quarter, the Beavers' Billy Main opened scoring by running in untouched from five yards out. Mike Haggard's extra point gave Oregon State a 7‚Äì0 lead. The lead would last all of 15 seconds. Stanford's Nate Kirtman returned the kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown, knotting the score at seven. Six minutes later, a 10-yard punt return by Mark Waletich gave the Beavers the ball at the Indians' 39. Oregon State drove 34 yards to set up Mike Haggard's 22-yard field goal with less than three minutes left. On the ensuing kickoff, Stanford's Gene Washington mistakenly downed the ball at his own one-yard line. The Indians could only manage four yards and Stanford could only manage a 10-yard punt. The Beavers could only manage four yards themselves, but Haggard's 28-yard field goal gave Oregon State a 13‚Äì7 lead with just over a minute left in the first half. In the second half, Stanford could only muster a 44-yard field goal attempt, which fell short of the crossbar. The Beavers' Skip Vanderbundt killed off three drives with interceptions. His second was with less than five minutes left. His last was at the Oregon State 16 with 1:25 left, which effectively ended the game. The Beavers would not win another season opener until 1977, under second-year coach Craig Fertig. =Arizona State= In heat, Andros summed up the playing conditions by saying, \\"It's hot as hell.\\" Arizona State caught the first break, recovering an Oregon State fumble at the Beaver 20. Oregon State's Mike Groff ended the threat by intercepting Ed Roseborough at the Beaver 15. Six plays later, Steve Preece dove in the end zone for a 7‚Äì0 lead. The Sun Devils responded by driving 63 yards for a touchdown of their own but missed the extra point. Late in the second quarter, Oregon State's Don Summers ran in from one-yard and Mike Haggard's extra point split the uprights. The Beavers went into the locker room up 14‚Äì6. In the first four minutes of the second half, Oregon State extended the lead on Preece's six- yard touchdown, but Haggard's extra point was blocked. In the third quarter, Arizona State benched Roseborough in favor of Rick Shaw. Shaw led the Sun Devils on a 47-yard drive and hit J. D. Hill for a two-point conversion to pull within six. Midway through the fourth quarter, Preece ran in for his third touchdown of the game. Arizona State countered with a late touchdown to make the score a more-respectable 27‚Äì21 but never seriously threatened after that. The Sun Devils went 8‚Äì1 the rest of the way, only losing by two to undefeated Wyoming, who finished #6 in the AP Poll, one spot in front of the Beavers. =Iowa= In the seventeen seasons from 1956‚Äì1972, Oregon State and Iowa played 12 times, more times than Oregon State played conference opponents California and UCLA in the same period. The Hawkeyes won the first five meetings, but the Beavers won the sixth 17‚Äì3 in 1966. In the first seven minutes, Oregon State built a 14‚Äì0 lead. Steve Preece scored the first, running untouched into the end zone from 35 yards out. Billy Main scored the second by dragging two defenders into the end zone. Main tacked on a second touchdown from 40 yards out later in the quarter. The Beavers had a chance to add another first-quarter touchdown but fumbled at the one. Oregon State got the ball back at their own six, and drove 94 yards on 11 plays. Bill Enyart's two-yard second quarter plunge put the Beavers up 28‚Äì0. Mike Haggard tacked on a 27-yard field goal for a 31‚Äì0 halftime lead. Iowa managed to outscore Oregon State 18‚Äì7 in the second half, although the Hawkeyes' final touchdown came with three seconds left. The nine-game winning streak remains the Beavers longest since 1962‚Äì1963. =Washington= By the time Oregon State arrived in Seattle, the season was already beginning to take its toll on the Beavers. Defensive starters, Harry Gunner and Mark Waletich, were sidelined. Gary Houser was unable to play tight end but still managed to perform his punting duties. Oregon State fumbled on its second play from scrimmage. Washington drove to the six before Charlie Olds came up with an interception in the end zone. The Beavers subsequently drove 80 yards in 14 plays for a touchdown, capped off by Steve Preece's one-yard plunge. Mike Haggard shanked the extra point, one of only three missed extra points in 1967, to keep the score 6‚Äì0. The Huskies responded by driving 72 yards to set up a 21-yard field goal to pull within three. Late in the half, a bad punt was nullified because the Beavers were called for clipping; instead of Oregon State getting the ball at their own 42, Washington took over at the Beaver 36. The Huskies drove 27 yards in five plays to set up a 26-yard field goal, which sent the teams into the locker rooms tied at six. Neither team threatened until the fourth quarter. The Beavers fumbled at their 35. From there, Washington's Carl Wojchiechowski ran in from 18-yards out with two minutes left to win 13‚Äì6. =Brigham Young= Brigham Young was 2‚Äì1. Their only loss was to undefeated Wyoming in Laramie. Wyoming finished the season #6 in the AP Poll. The Cougars had defeated New Mexico and West Michigan by a combined 55 points. On Oregon State's second play from scrimmage, Steve Preece was intercepted. Eight plays later, the Cougars were up 7‚Äì0. Later in the quarter, Don Whitley intercepted a Brigham Young pass and returned it to the Cougar two. On the next play, Bill Enyart plowed in for a touchdown, knotting the score at seven. The Beavers‚Äô best drives in the second quarter ended on a fumble and a missed 50-yard field goal. Brigham Young scored on a 40-yard field goal with less than three minutes left to take a 10‚Äì7 lead. They tacked on a 68-yard touchdown pass to take a 10-point lead into halftime. Early in the fourth quarter, the Cougars added another touchdown for a 24‚Äì7 lead. Brigham Young was driving again in the fourth quarter, but Mark Waletich came up with an interception at the Oregon State two yard-line. The Beavers drove 98 yards, including a 31-yard touchdown pass from Preece to Billy Main to pull within 11. The Beavers‚Äô best drive after that point ended after an interception. After Oregon State's defense forced a punt, the Beavers‚Äô next drive ended when Preece's pass bounced off a receiver's helmet and was intercepted by Bobby Smith. Smith returned the interception 27 yards for a touchdown to wrap up the Brigham Young victory. Oregon State committed 11 turnovers in the game, one fewer than the 12 the Beavers committed over the next five games. =Purdue= Entering the game, three undefeated teams topped the AP Poll: the Trojans, the Boilermakers, and the Bruins. All three were on the Beavers‚Äô schedule over the next four weeks. The first was #2 Purdue, the defending Rose Bowl champions on a nine-game winning streak. In 1967, the Boilermakers started the season beating Texas A&M; in Texas and #1 Notre Dame. The week before Oregon State came to West Lafayette, Purdue beat Ohio State 41‚Äì6 in Columbus. The win remains the largest by any team over the Buckeyes in Ohio Stadium since 1946. Purdue's stars were Mike Phipps at quarterback and Leroy Keyes at cornerback, running back, and punt and kick returner. Keyes would finish third in the Heisman balloting in 1967 and second in 1968. In both years, he was an All- American at both cornerback and running back. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated's 1968 college football preview. In 1987, he was voted the all-time greatest Purdue football player. In 2004, College Football News voted him the 86th best football player of all-time. Phipps would finish second in the Heisman balloting in 1970. The Boilermaker faithful did not give the Beavers much of a chance, erecting tombstones with the Oregon State players‚Äô names on them. The Beaver coaches made sure to drive the Oregon State bus past them the day before the game. Purdue entered the game 20-point favorites. The day before the game, the voice of Oregon State football, Bob Blackburn was at a tuxedo-required event in Seattle. After the event ended, he realized that he would not have time to change before his flight, so he flew to Indiana and called the game in his tuxedo. Oregon State's first drive went 82 yards, ending in a touchdown on an 18-yard touchdown pass from Steve Preece to a wide open Roger Cantlon for a 7‚Äì0 lead. The Boilermakers took less than two minutes to drive 62-yards for their own touchdown on Keyes‚Äô 15-yard run to tie the game at seven with more than ten minutes left in the first quarter. At that point, the defenses took over, holding both offenses scoreless for more than 24 minutes. Late in the second quarter, Jess Lewis and Jon Sandstrom combined to recover a fumble at the Purdue 26. The Beavers drove 17 yards to set up Mike Haggard's 26-yard field goal with 46 seconds left in the half. Oregon State went into the locker room 30 minutes away from pulling off the upset. In the third quarter, Keyes scored his second touchdown on a seven-yard run to give the Boilermakers the lead for the first time, 14‚Äì10. After the touchdown, the Beavers‚Äô defense stiffened, not allowing Purdue past the Oregon State 40 for the rest of the game. Late in the third quarter, the Beavers pulled within one on Haggard's 32-yard field goal. With 6:35 left, Jess Lewis came up with his second fumble at the Boilermaker 30. Six of the next seven plays, Preece handed off to Bill Enyart, who capped the drive with a four-yard run with 3:54 left. However, the two-point conversion failed, leaving Oregon State in front by five. Haggard was instructed to kick the ball away from Keyes. He lofted the ball high in the air, and Purdue was unable to field the kick, which was recovered by the Beavers' Mel Easley on the Boilermaker 28. Oregon State only managed seven yards, but Haggard converted his third field goal, a 38-yarder with 1:06 left to put the Beavers on top 22‚Äì14. Purdue's last hope evaporated when Mike Groff intercepted the Boilermakers' first pass on their next drive to seal the victory. 2000 people turned out at the Corvallis Airport to welcome the team home. The Beavers' win remains Oregon State's only visit to West Lafayette. The Beavers have not returned to Indiana. Upon finding out that Blackburn had worn a tuxedo to the game, Dee Andros asked Blackburn to keep wearing the tuxedo, which he did for the rest of the season. =Washington State= After a first quarter Washington State punt, personal fouls on back-to-back plays gave Oregon State the ball at the Cougar 12. Five Bill Enyart carries later, the Beavers were up 7‚Äì0. Washington State's best drives of the first half ended in a missed 40-yard field goal and a fumble that Skip Vanderbundt recovered at the Oregon State 31. On the ensuing drive, a 28-yard Billy Main carry gave the Beavers the ball at the Cougar nine. Enyart carried three consecutive times for his second touchdown and a 14‚Äì0 Oregon State lead with 1:38 left. The Beavers held Washington State to three- and-out and got the ball back at their own 27. After a 15-yard screen pass from Steve Preece to Billy Main, Preece hit Main again for a 58-yard touchdown and a 21‚Äì0 Oregon State lead. On the Cougars' opening drive of the second half, they pulled within two touchdowns. Two minutes later, Washington State recovered a blocked Gary Houser punt at the Beaver four. However, the Cougars could get no closer on four plays to end the threat. Oregon State would tack on two fourth-quarter touchdowns to take a 35‚Äì7 lead. Washington State would threaten one more time. The Beavers' Larry Rich made a touchdown-saving tackle at the Oregon State three, and the Beavers kept the Cougars out of the end zone to preserve the 28-point victory. =UCLA= Oregon State and UCLA met for the first time since 1958, the final year of the Pacific Coast Conference. The game pitted the Beavers against their former coach, Tommy Prothro, for the first time. The game was the third between Dee Andros and Prothro. Prothro had won the first two. The Bruins began the season by beating #3 Tennessee. They followed the win by beating Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania by 32. Later in the season, they returned to Pennsylvania and beat Penn State by two. The Nittany Lions wound up #10 in the AP Poll; the loss to UCLA was their biggest loss of the year. The star for UCLA was quarterback Gary Beban, who would go on to win the 1967 Heisman and Maxwell Trophies. He and their three All-Conference linemen were the biggest reasons the Bruins were averaging 31 points an outing, averaging victories over their opponents by more than 15 points a game. There was no All-Conference selection for kicker in 1967, but UCLA's Zenon Andrusyshyn almost certainly would have been the All-Conference selection. The Bruins‚Äô bye week was the previous week, so UCLA had two weeks to prepare for the Beavers. Oddsmakers initially made the Bruins a 13-point favorite but gamblers loaded up on upset-minded Oregon State. At kickoff, the spread was a mere seven points. In the first quarter, the Beavers got the first break, when Oregon State's Jim Belcher came up with a fumbled punt at the UCLA 38. Two plays after Steve Preece scrambled for 35 yards, Bill Enyart bowled in from one yard out for a 7‚Äì0 lead. At the beginning of the second quarter, the Bruins stopped Enyart six inches from the end zone, but Enyart spun into the end zone. The referees ruled that Enyart's forward progress had been stopped and gave the ball to UCLA. On the ensuing drive, the Beavers' Bill Nelson jarred the ball loose from the Bruins' Rick Purdy. Oregon State's Jess Lewis recovered the fumble, but one of the officials had blown the play dead, while the ball was still in the air. The officials ultimately awarded the ball to UCLA, who drove 99 yards for a touchdown, knotting the score at seven. UCLA followed the touchdown with a 52-yard Andrusyshyn field goal. With less than two minutes left, the Bruins recovered a blocked Gary Houser punt at the Beaver 16. Oregon State's defense did not allow the Bruins a yard, but Andrushyn kicked a 33-yard field goal to give UCLA a 13‚Äì7 halftime lead. Both teams' defenses dominated most of the third quarter, but the Beavers' Billy Main managed to scamper into the end zone from nine yards out. Mike Haggard's all-important extra point hit the left upright, which preserved a 13-all tie. In the fourth quarter, the Bruins put together a 71-yard drive aided by an inadvertent whistle, which nullified a UCLA fumble. The Bruins had to settle for a 26-yard field goal. UCLA threatened again later in the quarter, but Mark Waletich intercepted a Beban pass in the Oregon State end zone with less than two minutes left. The Beavers drove 69 yards in less than a minute but faced fourth-and-six at the Bruin 11. Andros opted to try a field goal. Haggard's 28-yard field goal split the uprights with 1:15 left. The Bruins, trying to avoid the first blemish on their record drove to the Oregon State 23. Andrushyn came on for a 40-yard field goal attempt, but Ron Boley batted down the kick with less than 10 seconds left to preserve the tie. The 16 points were the fewest that UCLA would score in 1967. Preece was voted AAWU Back of the Day. Defensive end Harry Gunner was voted AAWU Lineman of the Day. 1000 people turned out at the Corvallis Airport to welcome the team home. The game had barely ended when Dee Andros began being assailed by questions about Oregon State's chances against the #1 Trojans. He finally grew sick of it and said, \\"I'm tired of playing these number two ranked teams. Bring on number one.\\" =Southern California= The #1 Trojans were a juggernaut. In the 1960s, USC would finish no worse than second in their conference, winning six conference championships, playing in five Rose Bowls and winning two national championships. The 1967 USC Trojans football team may have been the best Trojan team in the decade. The Sporting News ranked that USC team as the #9 team of the 20th century. Their non-conference schedule included #1 Notre Dame in Notre Dame; #3 Michigan State in East Lansing; and #4 Texas in the Coliseum. Southern California started off the non-conference slate with a 17‚Äì13 win over Texas. Then, they defeated Michigan State 21‚Äì17. In the Battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh, the Trojans defeated the Irish 24‚Äì7 at Notre Dame. The 17-point loss served as the largest margin of defeat the Irish would endure at Notre Dame between 1963 and 1976. When the Trojans rolled into Corvallis, they were averaging winning every game by more than 20 points against a very difficult schedule. The game marked the Trojans' first-ever trip to Corvallis. All previous Oregon State \\"home\\" games between the two teams had been held in Portland and Tacoma. USC's two biggest stars were right tackle Ron Yary and halfback O. J. Simpson. Yary was the best lineman in the country and would win the Outland and Rockne Trophies at the end of the year. Simpson led the country with 1050 rushing yards. He would go on to finish second on Heisman ballots in 1967 and would win the trophy in 1968. Both players would wind up as the first overall pick of the NFL draft after their respective senior seasons, and each would enter both the College Football and Pro Football Halls of Fame. On defense, the Trojans had three First Team All- Americans: Tim Rossovich at end, Adrian Young at linebacker, and Mike Battle in the secondary. The game was highly anticipated. California governor (and future President) Ronald Reagan and Oregon governor Tom McCall made the trip. Reagan had famously said he would handpick a box of oranges if Oregon State won. Tom McCall turned the boast into a bet when he offered to put up a freshly caught silver salmon against Ronald Reagan's handpicked box of oranges. The game was held on Veterans Day, so, along with the two governors, ten generals and admirals, including Lt. General Jimmy Doolittle; three Congressional Medal of Honor recipients; and the Air Force Academy Drum and Bugle Corps were on hand. Additionally, the 1942 Oregon State Rose Bowl team was celebrating its 25th anniversary and were in attendance. All told, 41,494 fans filled the 40,750-seat stadium. It was the most-attended single sporting event in the history of Oregon to that date. The weather, which became a topic of contention after the fact, was typical for a November in Oregon. From the eighth to the eleventh only .83\\" of rain fell. At kickoff, the #1 Trojans were 11-point favorites over the #13 Beavers. On the Trojans' first play from scrimmage, Simpson quickly showed he was worthy of Heisman consideration, rushing for 40 yards around left end. However, the Trojans were forced to settle for a 36-yard field goal attempt, which sailed wide right. The Trojans did not get any closer to the Beaver end zone for the rest of the game. By the end of the first quarter, Simpson had already rushed for 87 yards. Early in the second quarter, the Juice finally broke loose. He shook off a tackler at the Trojan 37 and steamed upfield with four blockers to lead him. He only had one man to beat, Mark Waletich. Simpson slowed down in an attempt to allow his blockers to make a play on Waletich. Waletich stayed in front of Simpson long enough and out of nowhere, Jess Lewis closed on Simpson, eventually dragging O.J. down from behind at the Beaver 32. USC would get eight yards on the next three plays. Rather than attempt a 41-yard field goal, the Trojans went for it, but Ron Boley tackled the Trojans' quarterback, Steve Sogge, for no gain. Later in the second quarter, Oregon State's Skip Vanderbundt came up with a Southern California fumble at the Trojan 47. Over the next eight plays, the Beavers rushed for 34 yards all on running plays by Bill Enyart, Steve Preece, and Billy Main. On fourth-and-three at the Trojan 13, Mike Haggard's 30 yarder split the uprights for a 3‚Äì0 lead. After holding USC to a three-and-out, Oregon State's Bob Mayes ran 25-yards on a reverse. However, Haggard's second attempt from 28 yards sailed wide right, and the half ended with a 3‚Äì0 Oregon State lead. In the third quarter, Enyart took off from the Beaver 24, and was not caught until he reached the Trojans' 19. When he was tackled, Enyart fumbled. The fumble was recovered by USC's team captain, Adrian Young. As the game wore on, both defenses only seemed to get stronger. Early in the fourth quarter, USC faced a third-and-two at its own 23. Ron Boley dropped Steve Sogge for a loss. Later in the quarter, the Trojans had their best scoring opportunity of the second half, when they faced third-and-one at Oregon State's 42. Boley again tackled Sogge in the backfield for a two-yard loss. Oregon State's returner, Charlie Olds, received the ensuing punt at the Beaver nine and raced downfield. He was hit at the Trojan 35-yard line and fumbled. The ball bounced near Olds but not near enough to recover the fumble. Instead, Olds knocked the ball out of bounds. The referees called a penalty for illegal batting, which was a personal foul, penalized by an automatic change of possession. USC was unable to generate a first down on the drive. In the last 44 minutes of the game, the Trojans managed just three first downs and only crossed midfield twice. Perhaps the best boost for the defense was the punting of Gary Houser. USC did not start a drive beyond their own 35 after a Houser punt all game long. With three minutes left, Skip Vanderbundt forced a Simpson fumble. It proved to be Simpson's final carry. He ended with 188 yards rushing but, more importantly, no touchdowns. Fittingly, Jess Lewis came up with the fumble at the Trojan 35. Oregon State's offense was so enthused that they managed their only first downs of the second half, which enabled the Beavers to run out the clock. The Beavers faced fourth-and-one at the Trojan 38 with 34 seconds left. Enyart ran for one yard and a first down. Preece took a knee to end the game. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote of Oregon State \\"Giant- killers? Heck, today they're the giants.\\" That night, Andros received congratulatory calls from Governor McCall, Senator Mark Hatfield, and Oklahoma's former head coach (and Andros' old coach), Bud Wilkinson. Oregon Journal sports editor George Pasero reported that Trojan Athletic Director Jess Hill told the Los Angeles papers that an AAWU rule would be passed to require teams to use tarpaulins in the week prior to a game. Governor Reagan issued a statement that he would help to purchase the tarp and that he would have his $1 donation in the mail shortly. Upon hearing the quotes from Hill and Reagan, Andros told the Journal that he would consider using a tarpaulin, if the Los Angeles schools purchased \\"a couple of big fans and blow the smog out of the Coliseum.\\" No AAWU rule was ever passed about the use of tarpaulins. Enyart finished with 135 yards. Simpson had 188 yards, 81 yards on two carries. The other Trojans were held to 18 yards combined. The 3‚Äì0 loss was the last time the Trojans would be shut out until they went on probation in 1983. USC would not lose another regular season game until 1970; for the rest of the 1960s decade, their only blemishes would be ties against arch- rival Notre Dame in 1968 and 1969, and a loss to national champion Ohio State in the 1969 Rose Bowl. The 1967 Oregon State team remains the only college football team to go undefeated against three top two teams in the same season. It is unclear whether Tom McCall ever received the box of oranges Ronald Reagan had promised to hand-pick. UCLA's 48‚Äì0 win over Washington the same day eliminated Oregon State from the Rose Bowl race. Conference rules did not permit more than one team to go to a bowl game at the time, so the Civil War would be Oregon State's last game of the year. On November 18, #1 UCLA and #2 USC battled for the Victory Bell in the Coliseum. UCLA was 7‚Äì0‚Äì1 and USC was 8‚Äì1. It has been dubbed the \\"Game of the Century\\" and the \\"signature game\\" in the rivalry. The 21‚Äì20 win on Simpson's 64-yard fourth quarter scamper helped propel the Trojans to a national championship. The Beavers' 1967 win over USC would be their last over the Trojans until 2000. =Oregon= The final opponent on #8 Oregon State's schedule was 2‚Äì7 Oregon. The Webfoots were not another giant, but they were improving. Their two victories had both come in the previous four weeks. Oregon's strength was their defense behind defensive coordinator John Robinson, All-Conference nose guard George Dames, and All- Conference defensive back Jim Smith. This was the first Civil War game at Autzen Stadium, which opened two months earlier with natural grass. The attendance was 40,100, a Civil War record at the time. Gary Houser's first punt was partially blocked and recovered by the Webfoots at the Beaver 31. On their first play from scrimmage, Oregon's Eric Olson threw a 20-yard pass. The Webfoots would only gain one yard on three plays and had to settle for a 27-yard field goal. Before halftime, Oregon State's Bill Enyart fumbled twice inside Oregon's 10-yard line. Charlie Olds ended the Webfoots' best drive of the second quarter by picking off an Eric Olsen pass in the Beaver red zone. Oregon State's first drive of the second half ended on a Beaver fumble at Oregon's 43. The Webfoots capitalized, quickly finding themselves with first- and-goal at the Beaver three. Oregon State's defense did not fold, stopping Oregon a foot short of the end zone on third-and-goal. However, the Webfoots dove in on their fourth attempt, increasing their lead to 10‚Äì0 with five minutes left in the third quarter. Oregon State was in dire straits after fumbling again at their own 45-yard line. Oregon drove 15 yards but missed a 47-yard field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Oregon State finally hit their stride. Starting at their own 20, the running game began finding holes over and through the Duck defense. On one third-and-eight, Steve Preece found Don Summers for a 35-yard gain. On the next play, Roger Cantlon slipped and fell down but still managed to haul in a pass at Oregon's one-yard line. From there, Enyart plowed over the Duck defenders and into the end zone, cutting Oregon's lead to 10‚Äì7 with nine minutes left. Oregon State's defense responded by forcing Oregon to go three-and-out. The punt only carried to the Beavers‚Äô 45. Nine plays later, Oregon State had the ball first-and-goal on the four- yard line. The Webfoots loaded up the middle to try to stop Enyart; however, Steve Preece threw them a curve, running around left end for a touchdown with two-and-a-half minutes left to take the lead, 14‚Äì10. After getting the ball back, Oregon's final four plays only netted seven yards, turning the ball over to Oregon State. The Webfoots did not get the ball back. =Final standing= The Civil War victory propelled the Beavers to #7 in the final AP Poll, which was their best ever final ranking. It would take another 33 years for Oregon State to be ranked any higher. Oregon State's 7‚Äì2‚Äì1 record was its best between 1962 and 2000. It is all the more impressive because the Beavers were only favored to win three of the ten games they played. NFL/AFL Draft Three Beavers were selected in the 1968 NFL/AFL Draft, the second common draft, which lasted seventeen rounds (462 selections). { class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:center\\"  Player  Position  Round  Pick  Franchise - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Skip VanderbundtLinebacker369 San Francisco 49ers - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Harry GunnerDefensive end8193 Cincinnati Bengals - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Gary HouserPunter/Tight end9236 New York Jets } :https://www.pro-football- reference.com/draft/1968.htm Footnotes Further reading * John H.

Early life Forsyth was born in Dunedin in 1868. He was the third son of James Forsyth of Dunedin. He received his education at schools in Dunedin and attended the University of Otago. He was prominent in rugby and represented Otago and Wellington. Professional life In 1884, Forsyth started to work for Dodgshun and Company, woollen importers. In 1891, when the head office transferred to Wellington, he moved to New Zealand's capital city. He was the manager of Dodgshun and Co. from 1894 to 1898. In 1898, he became the accountant and secretary for the Te Aro House Drapery Company Ltd. He became that company's assistant manager in 1905 and general manager in 1914, a position that he held until 1922, when he started his private accountancy practice. Public roles Forsyth was a member of the Wellington Education Board for 18 years, and for 16 of those, he was its chairman. He held governance roles with the Technical College, Wellington College, and Victoria College. Forsyth was first elected onto Wellington City Council in 1919 and had almost continuous membership until his death. The Civic League nominated him as their candidate for the 1925 mayoralty, but he withdrew in favour of Charles Norwood, who was the successful candidate. Forsyth first stood in a general election in , when he was one of four candidates in the electorate. He came second, beaten by Labour's Alec Monteith. He won the Wellington East electorate in the 1925 general election by defeating Monteith. Forsyth was defeated in the next general election in 1928 by Labour's Bob Semple. He stood once more in but was again beaten by Semple. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Family and death On 30 August 1894, Forsyth married Elizabeth Smith at Dunedin. She was the eldest daughter of Alexander Smith of Gracefield in County Londonderry, Ireland. Elizabeth Forsyth died on 26 September 1935 at their Wellington home and was buried at Karori Cemetery in Wellington. Thomas Forsyth died at his son's house in Masterton on 6 February 1941. He is also buried at Karori Cemetery. He was survived by one son and three daughters.

Completed in 1809 when Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, it survived until March 1966, when it was severely damaged by explosives planted by Irish republicans. Its remnants were later destroyed by the Irish Army. The decision to build the monument was taken by Dublin Corporation in the euphoria following Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The original design by William Wilkins was greatly modified by Francis Johnston, on grounds of cost. The statue was sculpted by Thomas Kirk. From its opening on 29 October 1809 the Pillar was a popular tourist attraction, but provoked aesthetic and political controversy from the outset. A prominent city centre monument honouring an Englishman rankled as Irish nationalist sentiment grew, and throughout the 19th century there were calls for it to be removed, or replaced with a memorial to an Irish hero. During the Easter Rising an attempt was made to blow up the pillar but the explosives failed to ignite due to dampness.http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0350.pdf#page=10 It remained in the city as most of Ireland became the Irish Free State in 1922, and the Republic of Ireland in 1949. The chief legal barrier to its removal was the trust created at the Pillar's inception, the terms of which gave the trustees a duty in perpetuity to preserve the monument. Successive Irish governments failed to deliver legislation overriding the trust. Although influential literary figures such as, W. B. Yeats and Oliver St. John Gogarty defended the Pillar on historical and cultural grounds, pressure for its removal intensified in the years preceding the 50th anniversary of the Rising, and its sudden demise was, on the whole, well-received by the public. Although it was widely believed that the action was the work of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the police were unable to identify any of those responsible. After years of debate and numerous proposals, the site was occupied in 2003 by the Spire of Dublin, a slim needle-like structure rising almost three times the height of the Pillar. In 2000, a former republican activist gave a radio interview in which he admitted planting the explosives in 1966, but, after questioning him, the Garda√≠ decided not to take action. Relics of the Pillar are found in Dublin museums and appear as decorative stonework elsewhere and its memory is preserved in numerous works of Irish literature. Background =Sackville Street and Blakeney= William Blakeney, whose Sackville Street statue preceded Nelson's The redevelopment of Dublin north of the River Liffey began in the early 18th century, largely through the enterprise of the property speculator Luke Gardiner. His best-known work was the transformation in the 1740s of a narrow lane called Drogheda Street, which he demolished and turned into a broad thoroughfare lined with large and imposing town houses. He renamed it Sackville Street, in honour of Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, who served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1731 to 1737 and from 1751 to 1755. After Gardiner's death in 1755 Dublin's growth continued, with many fine public buildings and grand squares, the city's status magnified by the presence of the Parliament of Ireland for six months of the year. The Acts of Union of 1800, which united Ireland and Great Britain under a single Westminster polity, ended the Irish parliament and presaged a period of decline for the city. The historian Tristram Hunt writes: \\"[T]he capital's dynamism vanished, absenteeism returned and the big houses lost their patrons\\". The first monument in Sackville Street was built in 1759 in the location where the Nelson Pillar would eventually stand. The subject was William Blakeney, 1st Baron Blakeney, a Limerick-born army officer whose career extended over more than 60 years and ended with his surrender to the French after the Siege of Minorca in 1756. A brass statue sculpted by John van Nost the younger was unveiled on St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1759. Donal Fallon, in his history of the Pillar, states that almost from its inception the Blakeney statue was a target for vandalism. Its fate is uncertain; Fallon records that it might have been melted down for cannon, but it had certainly been removed by 1805. =Trafalgar= Nelson's death aboard HMS Victory, painting by Denis Dighton, On 21 October 1805, a Royal Naval fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Lord Nelson defeated the combined fleets of the French and Spanish navies in the Battle of Trafalgar. At the height of the battle Nelson was mortally wounded on board his flagship, ; by the time he died later that day, victory was assured. Nelson had been hailed in Dublin seven years earlier, after the Battle of the Nile, as defender of the Harp and Crown, the respective symbols of Ireland and Britain. When news of Trafalgar reached the city on 8 November, there were similar scenes of patriotic celebration, together with a desire that the fallen hero should be commemorated. The mercantile classes had particular reason to be grateful for a victory that restored the freedom of the high seas and removed the threat of a French invasion. Many of the city's population had relatives who had been involved in the battle: up to one-third of the sailors in Nelson's fleet were from Ireland, including around 400 from Dublin itself. In his short account of the Pillar, Dennis Kennedy considers that Nelson would have been regarded in the city as a hero, not just among the Protestant Ascendancy but by many Catholics among the rising middle and professional classes. The first step towards a permanent memorial to Nelson was taken on 18 November 1805 by the city aldermen, who after sending a message of congratulation to King George III, agreed that the erection of a statue would form a suitable tribute to Nelson's memory. On 28 November, after a public meeting had supported this sentiment, a \\"Nelson committee\\" was established, chaired by the Lord Mayor. It contained four of the city's Westminster MPs, alongside other city notables including Arthur Guinness, the son of the brewery founder. The committee's initial tasks were to decide precisely what form the monument should take and where it should be put. They had also to raise the funds to pay for it. Inception, design and construction At its first meeting the Nelson committee established a public subscription, and early in 1806 invited artists and architects to submit design proposals for a monument. No specifications were provided, but the contemporary European vogue in commemorative architecture was for the classical form, typified by Trajan's Column in Rome. Monumental columns, or \\"pillars of victory\\", were uncommon in Ireland at the time; the Cumberland Column in Birr, County Offaly, erected in 1747, was a rare exception. From the entries submitted, the Nelson committee's choice was that of a young English architect, William Wilkins, then in the early stages of a distinguished career. Wilkins's proposals envisaged a tall Doric column on a plinth, surmounted by a sculpted Roman galley. The choice of the Sackville Street site was not unanimous. The Wide Streets Commissioners were worried about traffic congestion, and argued for a riverside location visible from the sea. Another suggestion was for a seaside position, perhaps Howth Head at the entrance to Dublin Bay. The recent presence of the Blakeney statue in Sackville Street, and a desire to arrest the street's decline in the post- parliamentary years, were factors that may have influenced the final selection of that site which, Kennedy says, was the preferred choice of the Lord Lieutenant. By mid-1807, fundraising was proving difficult; sums raised at that point were well short of the likely cost of erecting Wilkins's column. The committee informed the architect with regret that \\"means were not placed in their hands to enable them to gratify him, as well as themselves, by executing his design precisely as he had given it\\". They employed Francis Johnston, architect to the City Board of Works, to make cost-cutting adjustments to Wilkins's scheme. Johnston simplified the design, substituting a large functional block or pedestal for Wilkins's delicate plinth, and replacing the proposed galley with a statue of Nelson. Thomas Kirk, a sculptor from Cork, was commissioned to provide the statue, to be fashioned from Portland stone. By December 1807 the fund stood at ¬£3,827, far short of the estimated ¬£6,500 required to finance the project. Nevertheless, by the beginning of 1808 the committee felt confident enough to begin the work, and organised the laying of the foundation stone. This ceremony took place on 15 February 1808‚Äîthe day following the anniversary of Nelson's victory at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797‚Äîamid much pomp, in the presence of the new Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Richmond, along with various civic dignitaries and city notables. A memorial plaque eulogising Nelson's Trafalgar victory was attached to the stone. The committee continued to raise money as construction proceeded; when the project was complete in the autumn of 1809, costs totalled ¬£6,856, but contributions had reached ¬£7,138, providing the committee with a surplus of ¬£282. When finished, the monument complete with its statue rose to a height of . The four sides of the pedestal were engraved with the names and dates of Nelson's greatest victories. A spiral stairway of 168 steps ascended the hollow interior of the column, to a viewing platform immediately beneath the statue. According to the committee's published report, of black limestone and of granite had been used to build the column and its pedestal. The Pillar opened to the public on 21 October 1809, on the fourth anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar; for ten pre-decimal pence, visitors could climb to a viewing platform just below the statue, and enjoy what an early report describes as \\"a superb panoramic view of the city, the country and the fine bay\\". History 1809‚Äì1916 =1809‚Äì1916= The Pillar quickly became a popular tourist attraction; Kennedy writes that \\"for the next 157 years its ascent was a must on every visitor's list\\". Yet from the beginning there were criticisms, on both political and aesthetic grounds. The September 1809 issue of the Irish Monthly Magazine, edited by the revolution-minded Walter \\"Watty\\" Cox, reported that \\"our independence has been wrested from us, not by the arms of France but by the gold of England. The statue of Nelson records the glory of a mistress and the transformation of our senate into a discount office\\". In an early (1818) history of the city of Dublin, the writers express awe at the scale of the monument, but are critical of several of its features: its proportions are described as \\"ponderous\\", the pedestal as \\"unsightly\\" and the column itself as \\"clumsy\\". However, Walker's Hibernian Magazine thought the statue was a good likeness of its subject, and that the Pillar's position in the centre of the wide street gave the eye a focal point in what was otherwise \\"wastes of pavements\\". Lower Sackville Street and the Pillar depicted by William Henry Bartlett in the early 1840s, around the time of Thackeray's visit By 1830, rising nationalist sentiment in Ireland made it likely that the Pillar was \\"the Ascendancy's last hurrah\\"‚ÄîKennedy observes that it probably could not have been built at any later date. Nevertheless, the monument often attracted favourable comment from visitors; in 1842 the writer William Makepeace Thackeray noted Nelson \\"upon a stone-pillar\\" in the middle of the \\"exceedingly broad and handsome\\" Sackville Street: \\"The Post Office is on his right hand (only it is cut off); and on his left, 'Gresham's' and the 'Imperial Hotel' \\". A few years later, the monument was a source of pride to some citizens, who dubbed it \\"Dublin's Glory\\" when Queen Victoria visited the city in 1849. Between 1840 and 1843 Nelson's Column was erected in London's Trafalgar Square. With an overall height of it was taller than its Dublin equivalent and, at ¬£47,000, much more costly to erect. It has no internal staircase or viewing platform. The London column was the subject of an attack during the Fenian dynamite campaign in May 1884, when a quantity of explosives was placed at its base but failed to detonate. In 1853 the queen attended the Dublin Great Industrial Exhibition, where a city plan was displayed that envisaged the removal of the Pillar. This proved impossible, as since 1811 legal responsibility for the Pillar had been vested in a trust, under the terms of which the trustees were required \\"to embellish and uphold the monument in perpetuation of the object for which it was subscribed\\". Any action to remove or resite the Pillar, or replace the statue, required the passage of an Act of Parliament in London; Dublin Corporation (the city government) had no authority in the matter. No action followed the city plan suggestion, but the following years saw regular attempts to remove the monument. A proposal was made in 1876 by Alderman Peter McSwiney, a former Lord Mayor, to replace the \\"unsightly structure\\" with a memorial to the recently deceased Sir John Gray, who had done much to provide Dublin with a clean water supply. The Corporation was unable to advance this idea. Design for the new 1894 entrance porch In 1882 the Moore Street Market and Dublin City Improvement Act was passed by the Westminster parliament, overriding the trust and giving the Corporation authority to resite the Pillar, but subject to a strict timetable, within which the city authorities found it impossible to act. The Act lapsed and the Pillar remained; a similar attempt, with the same result, was made in 1891. Not all Dubliners favoured demolition; some businesses considered the Pillar to be the city's focal point, and the tramway company petitioned for its retention as it marked the central tram terminus. \\"In many ways\\", says Fallon, \\"the pillar had become part of the fabric of the city\\". Kennedy writes: \\"A familiar and very large if rather scruffy piece of the city's furniture, it was The Pillar, Dublin's Pillar rather than Nelson's Pillar ... it was also an outing, an experience\\". The Dublin sculptor John Hughes invited students at the Metropolitan School of Art to \\"admire the elegance and dignity\\" of Kirk's statue, \\"and the beauty of the silhouette\\". In 1894 there were some significant alterations to the Pillar's fabric. The original entry on the west side, whereby visitors entered the pedestal by a flight of steps taking them down below street level, was replaced by a new ground level entrance on the south side, with a grand porch. The whole monument was surrounded by heavy iron railings. In the new century, despite the growing nationalism within Dublin‚Äî80 per cent of the Corporation's councillors were nationalists of some description‚Äîthe pillar was liberally decorated with flags and streamers to mark the 1905 Trafalgar centenary. The changing political atmosphere had long been signalled by the arrival in Sackville Street of further monuments, all celebrating distinctively Irish heroes, in what the historian Yvonne Whelan describes as defiance of the British Government, a \\"challenge in stone\\". Between the 1860s and 1911, Nelson was joined by monuments to Daniel O'Connell, William Smith O'Brien and Charles Stewart Parnell, as well as Sir John Gray and the temperance campaigner Father Mathew. Meanwhile, in 1861, after decades of construction, the Wellington Monument in Dublin's Phoenix Park was completed, the foundation stone having been laid in 1817. This vast obelisk, high and square at the base, honoured Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, Dublin-born and a former Chief Secretary for Ireland. Unlike the Pillar, Wellington's obelisk has attracted little controversy and has not been the subject of physical attacks. =Easter Rising, April 1916= On Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, units of the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army seized several prominent buildings and streets in central Dublin, including the General Post Office (GPO) in Sackville Street, one of the buildings nearest the Pillar. They set up headquarters at the GPO where they declared an Irish Republic under a provisional government. One of the first recorded actions of the Easter Rising occurred near the Pillar when lancers from the nearby Marlborough Street barracks, sent to investigate the disturbance, were fired on from the GPO. They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and two horses dead. Sackville Street after the Easter Rising, showing the burnt out shell of the General Post Office and the intact Pillar in the background During the days that followed, Sackville Street and particularly the area around the Pillar became a battleground. According to some histories, insurgents attempted to blow up the Pillar. The accounts are unconfirmed and were disputed by many that fought in the Rising, on the grounds that the Pillar's large base provided them with useful cover as they moved to and from other rebel positions. By Thursday night, British artillery fire had set much of Sackville Street ablaze, but according to the writer Peter De Rosa's account: \\"On his pillar, Nelson surveyed it all serenely, as though he were lit up by a thousand lamps\\". The statue was visible against the fiery backdrop from as far as Killiney, away. By Saturday, when the provisional government finally surrendered, many of the Sackville Street buildings between the Pillar and the Liffey had been destroyed or badly damaged, including the Imperial Hotel that Thackeray had admired. Of the GPO, only the fa√ßade remained; against the tide of opinion Bernard Shaw said the demolition of the city's classical architecture scarcely mattered: \\"What does matter is the Liffey slums have not been demolished\\". An account in a New York newspaper reported that the Pillar had been lost in the destruction of the street, but it had sustained only minor damage, chiefly bullet marks on the column and statue itself‚Äîone shot is said to have taken off Nelson's nose. =Post partition= After the Irish war of Independence 1919‚Äì21 and the treaty that followed, Ireland was partitioned; Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, a Dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations. From December 1922, when the Free State was inaugurated, the Pillar became an issue for the Irish rather than the British government. In 1923, when Sackville Street was again in ruins during the Irish Civil War, The Irish Builder and Engineer magazine called the original siting of the Pillar a \\"blunder\\" and asked for its removal, a view echoed by the Dublin Citizens Association. The poet William Butler Yeats, who had become a member of the Irish Senate, favoured its re-erection elsewhere, but thought it should not, as some wished, be destroyed, because \\"the life and work of the people who built it are part of our tradition.\\" Sackville Street was renamed O'Connell Street in 1924. The following year the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the Dublin Civic Survey demanded legislation to allow the Pillar's removal, without success. Pressure continued, and in 1926 The Manchester Guardian reported that the Pillar was to be taken down, \\"as it was a hindrance to modern traffic\\". Requests for action‚Äîremoval, destruction or the replacement of the statue with that of an Irish hero‚Äîcontinued up to the Second World War and beyond; the main stumbling blocks remained the trustees' strict interpretation of the terms of the trust, and the unwillingness of successive Irish governments to take legislative action. In 1936 the magazine of the ultra-nationalist Blueshirts movement remarked that this inactivity showed a failure in the national spirit: \\"The conqueror is gone, but the scars which he left remain, and the victim will not even try to remove them\\". By 1949 the Irish Free State had evolved into the Republic of Ireland and left the British Commonwealth, but not all Irish opinion favoured the removal of the Pillar. That year the architectural historian John Harvey called it \\"a grand work\\", and argued that without it, \\"O'Connell Street would lose much of its vitality\\". Most of the pressure to get rid of it, he said, came from \\"traffic maniacs who ... fail to visualise the chaos which would result from creating a through current of traffic at this point\\". In a 1955 radio broadcast Thomas Bodkin, former director of the National Gallery of Ireland, praised not only the monument, but Nelson himself: \\"He was a man of extraordinary gallantry. He lost his eye fighting bravely, and his arm in a similar fashion\\". On 29 October 1955, a group of nine students from University College Dublin obtained keys from the Pillar's custodian and locked themselves inside, with an assortment of equipment including flame throwers. From the gallery they hung a poster of Kevin Barry, a Dublin Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteer executed by the British during the War of Independence. A crowd gathered below, and began to sing the Irish rebel song \\"Kevin Barry\\". Eventually members of the Garda√≠ (Irish police) broke into the Pillar and ended the demonstration. No action was taken against the students, whose principal purpose, the Garda√≠ claimed, was publicity. In 1956, members of the Fianna F√°il party, then in opposition, proposed that the statue be replaced by one of Robert Emmet, Protestant leader of an abortive rebellion in 1803. They thought that such a gesture might inspire Protestants in Northern Ireland to fight for a reunited Ireland. In the North the possibility of dismantling and re-erecting the monument in Belfast was raised in the Stormont parliament, but the initiative failed to gain the support of the Northern Ireland government. In 1959 a new Fianna F√°il government under Se√°n Lemass deferred the question of the Pillar's removal on the grounds of cost; five years later Lemass agreed to \\"look at\\" the question of replacing Nelson's statue with one of Patrick Pearse, the leader of the Easter Rising, in time for the 50th anniversary of the Rising in 1966. An offer from the Irish-born American trade union leader Mike Quill to finance the removal of the Pillar was not taken up, and as the anniversary approached, Nelson remained in place. Destruction The pillar on the morning of 8 March 1966 Horatio Nelson's head, from the statue destroyed in the explosion, displayed in the Dublin City Library on Pearse Street. On 8 March 1966, a powerful explosion destroyed the upper portion of the Pillar and brought Nelson's statue crashing to the ground amid hundreds of tons of rubble. O'Connell Street was almost deserted at the time, although a dance in the nearby Hotel Metropole's ballroom was about to end and bring crowds on to the street. There were no casualties‚Äîa taxi-driver parked close by had a narrow escape‚Äîand damage to property was relatively light given the strength of the blast. What was left of the Pillar was a jagged stump, high. In the first government response to the action, the Justice minister, Brian Lenihan, condemned what he described as \\"an outrage which was planned and committed without any regard to the lives of the citizens\\". This response was considered \\"tepid\\" by The Irish Times, whose editorial deemed the attack \\"a direct blow to the prestige of the state and the authority of the government\\". Kennedy suggests that government anger was mainly directed at what they considered a distraction from the official 50th anniversary celebrations of the Rising. The absence of the pillar was regretted by some who felt the city had lost one of its most prominent landmarks. The Irish Literary Association was anxious that, whatever future steps were taken, the lettering on the pedestal should be preserved; the Irish Times reported that the Royal Irish Academy of Music was considering legal measures to prevent removal of the remaining stump. Reactions among the general public were relatively light- hearted, typified by the numerous songs inspired by the incident. These included the immensely popular \\"Up Went Nelson\\", set to the tune of \\"John Brown's Body\\" and performed by a group of Belfast schoolteachers, which remained at the top of the Irish charts for eight weeks. An American newspaper reported that the mood in the city was one of gaiety, with shouts of \\"Nelson has lost his last battle!\\" Some accounts relate that the Irish president, √âamon de Valera, phoned The Irish Press to suggest the headline: \\"British Admiral Leaves Dublin By Air\\"‚Äîaccording to the senator and presidential candidate David Norris, \\"the only recorded instance of humour in that lugubrious figure\\". Lettering from Nelson's Pillar in the Butler House Walled Garden in 2009 The Pillar's fate was sealed when Dublin Corporation issued a \\"dangerous building\\" notice. The trustees agreed that the stump should be removed. A last-minute request by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland for an injunction to delay the demolition on planning grounds was rejected by Justice Thomas Teevan. On 14 March, the Army destroyed the stump by a controlled explosion, watched at a safe distance by a crowd who, the press reported, \\"raised a resounding cheer\\". There was a scramble for souvenirs, and many parts of the stonework were taken from the scene. Some of these relics, including Nelson's head, eventually found their way into museums; parts of the lettered stonework from the pedestal are displayed in the grounds of the Butler House hotel in Kilkenny, while smaller remnants were used to decorate private gardens. Contemporary and subsequent accounts record that the army's explosion caused more damage than the first, but this, Fallon says, is a myth; damage claims arising from the second explosion amounted to less than a quarter of the sum claimed as a result of the original blast. Aftermath =Investigations= It was initially assumed that the monument was destroyed by the IRA. The Guardian reported on 9 March that six men had been arrested and questioned, but their identities were not revealed and there were no charges. An IRA spokesman denied involvement, stating that they had no interest in demolishing mere symbols of foreign domination: \\"We are interested in the destruction of the domination itself\\". In the absence of any leads, rumours suggested that the Basque separatist movement ETA might be responsible, perhaps as part of a training exercise with an Irish republican splinter group; in the mid-1960s the explosives expertise of ETA was generally acknowledged. No further information was forthcoming until 2000, when during a Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann interview a former IRA member, Liam Sutcliffe, claimed he had placed the bomb which detonated in the Pillar. In the 1950s Sutcliffe was associated with a group of dissident volunteers led by Joe Christle (1927‚Äì98), who had been expelled from the IRA in 1956 for \\"recklessness\\". In early 1966 Sutcliffe learned that Christle's group was planning \\"Operation Humpty Dumpty\\", an attack on the Pillar, and offered his services. According to Sutcliffe, on 28 February he placed a bomb within the Pillar, timed to go off in the early hours of the next morning. The explosive was a mixture of gelignite and ammonal. It failed to detonate; Sutcliffe says that he returned early the next morning, recovered the device and redesigned its timer. On 7 March, shortly before the Pillar closed for the day, he climbed the inner stairway and placed the refurbished bomb near to the top of the shaft before going home. He learned of the success of his mission the next day, he says, having slept undisturbed through the night. Following his revelations, Sutcliffe was questioned by the Garda S√≠och√°na (police) but not charged. He did not name others involved in the action, apart from Christle and his brother, Mick Christle. =Replacements= On 29 April 1969 the Irish parliament passed the Nelson Pillar Act, terminating the Pillar Trust and vesting ownership of the site in Dublin Corporation. The trustees received ¬£21,170 in compensation for the Pillar's destruction, and a further sum for loss of income. In the debate, Senator Owen Sheehy-Skeffington argued that the Pillar had been capable of repair and should have been re-assembled and rebuilt. Henry Street For more than twenty years the site stood empty, while various campaigns sought to fill the space. In 1970 the Arthur Griffith Society suggested a monument to Arthur Griffith, founder of Sinn F√©in, and Pearse, whose centenary would fall in 1979, was the subject of several proposals. None of these schemes were accepted by the Corporation. A request in 1987 by the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission that the Pillar be rebuilt‚Äîwith a different statue‚Äîwas likewise rejected. In 1988, as part of the Dublin Millennium celebrations, businessman Michael Smurfit commissioned in memory of his father the Smurfit Millennium Fountain, erected close to the site of the pillar. The fountain included a bronze statue of Anna Livia, a personification of the River Liffey, sculpted by √âamonn O'Doherty. The monument, known colloquially as the Floozie in the Jacuzzi, was not universally appreciated; O'Doherty's fellow-sculptor Edward Delaney called it an \\"atrocious eyesore\\". 1988 saw the launch of the Pillar Project, aimed at encouraging artists and architects to bring forward new ideas for an appropriate permanent memorial to replace Nelson. Suggestions included a flagpole, a triumphal arch modelled on the Paris Arc de Triomphe, and a \\"Tower of Light\\" with a platform that would restore Nelson's view over the city. In 1997 Dublin Corporation announced a formal design competition for a monument to mark the new millennium in 2000. The winning entry was Ian Ritchie's Spire of Dublin, a plain, needle-like structure rising from the street. The design was approved; on 22 January 2003 it was completed, despite some political and artistic opposition. During the excavations preceding the Spire's construction, the foundation stone of the Nelson Pillar was recovered. Press stories that a time capsule containing valuable coins had also been discovered fascinated the public for a while, but proved illusory. Cultural references The destruction of the Pillar brought a temporary glut of popular songs, including \\"Nelson's Farewell\\", by The Dubliners, in which Nelson's airborne demise is presented as Ireland's contribution to the space race. While in New York, Tommy Makem wrote \\"Lord Nelson\\" which he performed with the Clancy Brothers. Ironically, he set the words to the tune of \\"The Sash my Father Wore,\\" a song of the militant Protestant Orange Order. During its more than 150 years, the Pillar was an integral if controversial part of Dublin life, and was often reflected in Irish literature of the period. James Joyce's novel Ulysses (1922) is a meticulous depiction of the city on a single day, 16 June 1904. At the base of the Pillar trams from all parts of the city come and go; meanwhile the character Stephen Dedalus fantasises a scene involving two elderly spinsters, who climb the steps to the viewing gallery where they eat plums and spit the stones down on those below, while gazing up at \\"the one- handled adulterer\\". Joyce shared Yeats's view that Ireland's association with England was an essential element in a shared history, and asked: \\"Tell me why you think I ought to change the conditions that gave Ireland and me a shape and a destiny?\\" Oliver St. John Gogarty, in his literary memoir As I Was Going Down Sackville Street, considers the Pillar \\"the grandest thing we have in Dublin\\", where \\"the statue in whiter stone gazed forever south towards Trafalgar and the Nile\\". That Pillar, says Gogarty, \\"marks the end of a civilization, the culmination of the great period of eighteenth century Dublin\\". Yeats's 1927 poem \\"The Three Monuments\\" has Parnell, Nelson and O'Connell on their respective monuments, mocking Ireland's post-independence leaders for their rigid morality and lack of courage, the obverse of the qualities of the \\"three old rascals\\". A later writer, Brendan Behan, in his Confessions of an Irish Rebel (1965) wrote from a Fenian perspective that Ireland owed Nelson nothing and that Dublin's poor regarded the Pillar as \\"a gibe at their own helplessness in their own country\\". In his poem \\"Dublin\\" (1939), written as the remaining vestiges of British overlordship were being removed from Ireland, Louis MacNeice envisages \\"Nelson on his pillar/ Watching his world collapse\\". Austin Clarke's 1957 poem \\"Nelson's Pillar, Dublin\\" scorns the various schemes to remove the monument and concludes \\"Let him watch the sky/ With those who rule. Stone eye/ And telescopes can prove/ Our blessings are above\\". John Boyne's 2017 novel \\"The Heart's Invisible Furies\\" includes a scene in the middle of the book that features the explosion at the pillar.

With 6 star Green Star office design rating, the building is part of the CBD's 'Golden Triangle' district. Its location is the site of the old Indigo House building, which was demolished over a period of six months starting in 2008. 95% of all waste from the old building is to be recycled or reused. The site is located between the Riverside Centre and Riparian Plaza buildings. Leighton Contractors constructed the Cox Rayner-designed skyscraper which has 54 floors including 44 levels of premium office space and 115 car parking spaces in the under ground carpark. The building cost $700 million to construct. Design One One One Eagle Street at night (centre) with LED lighting resembling the buttress roots of a Moreton Bay fig tree The building contains a steel structural frame and was designed by architects Cox Rayner and takes inspiration from nature, with its design based on the algorithm of the way plants grow towards the light. Ceiling heights are with a fully glazed exterior to maximise views. One of the major aspects of the building will be its emphasis on sustainability, with features such as gas-fired for on-site power generators, to reduce impact of CO2 production, 50% greater ventilation than most Australian office buildings, it also included plans to River Heat Rejection process to reduce strain on the cooling towers as well as saving millions of litres of water, however this to date has not been installed. There is also a proposal for a water recycling plant for the building for waste water management to be used in conjunction with rainwater tanks for use in toilets and irrigation. Blinds will be sensor-activated to trap hot air before pumping it outside. The outside of the building is furnished with 52,000 LED lights. The lighting design imitates the buttress roots of a Moreton Bay Fig tree. The buildings lobby and ground floor were used in the filming of the 2015 film San Andreas, being used to represent the foyer of a skyscraper in downtown San Francisco. Construction The project manager and project director for One One One Eagle Street were Burns Bridge Sweett. Excavation of the basement levels was conducted while the floors above were being constructed, a process referred to as the top-down method. The building's topping out was celebrated on 18 May 2011, with two utilities floors remaining to be completed.

The upper-middle-class family from the metropolitan Detroit area of Lathrup Village, Michigan, were shot and killed while vacationing in their Lake Michigan cottage just north of Good Hart, Michigan, near the Straits of Mackinac. This case remained unsolved after a 15-month investigation by the Michigan State Police and the Emmet County Sheriff's Office.Michigan State Police. Case Evidence Report CR 4114-08-785-66, December 17, 1969 However, when the investigation was completed in December 1969, evidence pointed to one person: Joseph Raymond Scolaro III, an embezzling employee of Richard Robison. Crime scene The murders began with five gunshots aimed at Richard Robison, fired through a rear window from a .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle. The murderer then entered the cottage through an unlocked door and killed the remaining five people with shots to the head from a .25-caliber semi-automatic pistol.Michigan State Police Synopsis for the Prosecution of the Richard Robison Murder Case, June 15, 1970 Susan and Richard Robison were also bludgeoned with a hammer found at the murder scene. Shirley Robison's body was intentionally posed so that when the crime scene was discovered it would lead the police to think that the crime was part of a sexual attack. Bloody footprints on the floor led investigators to conclude that one person committed the murders. The bodies were not discovered for 27 days and conditions at the murder scene resulted in advanced decomposition of the bodies. Investigation By the second week of the investigation, which had begun on Monday, July 22, 1968, the Michigan State Police and the Emmet County authorities suspected Richard Robison's employee Joseph R. Scolaro III, aged 30. He had not been seen or heard from for more than twelve hours on the day of the murders, and his alibis for that time period all proved invalid. He had also purchased both of the murder weapons determined by police forensic tests to have been used in the Robison family murders, specifically, a .25 caliber Jet-Fire automatic Beretta pistol #47836, and a .22 caliber AR-7 ArmaLite semi-automatic rifle #75878. The four .22 caliber spent shells found at the cabin murder scene were forensically compared by their ballistic markings to several .22 caliber evidence shells known to have been fired by Scolaro at a family firing range in 1967 at which time Scolaro used his missing .22 caliber ArmaLite rifle #75878. The two sets of shells were found to be an exact match. Although Scolaro claimed to have given this weapon away, a neighbor had told police he had seen the .22 caliber AR-7 rifle in Scolaro's house not long before the Robisons were killed. Scolaro's missing .25 caliber Beretta automatic pistol #47836, which he also claimed to police to have given away prior to the June 25, 1968 murders, was matched forensically in similar class characteristics to a second identical .25 caliber Beretta pistol #47910 that he produced for police on the second day after the bodies were found in Good Hart. Both guns had been purchased by Scolaro on the same day, February 2, 1968. Also found at the murder scene were several Sako .25 caliber spent cartridges, a rare 1968 Finnish brand sold only for the limited time of a few weeks in Michigan (January‚ÄìFebruary, 1968) prior to the murders. It was documented by investigators that one of the actual few Sako ammunition purchasers in Michigan had been Joseph Scolaro III, on February 2, 1968. Scolaro's statements that he had given away both of the missing murder weapons and the Sako ammunition prior to the June 25, 1968, killings also proved invalid. They were one more part of his elaborate scheme to obstruct the investigation of the crime. During the lengthy murder investigation it was determined by a forensic accountant that more than $60,000 was missing from the two combined businesses of Richard Robison. The two Robison businesses had been left in the care of the suspect Scolaro prior to the murders. The two investigating police agencies involved in the case presented their combined Evidence Case Report CR 4114-08-785-66 to the jurisdictional prosecution on December 17, 1969. The detailed report implicated Joseph Scolaro as the sole perpetrator of the mass murder crime. In mid-January 1970, Emmet County prosecutor Donald C. Noggle decided not to bring charges against Scolaro at that time, citing the two missing murder weapons and the absence of his fingerprints from the crime scene. Outcome During the course of the investigation, the suspect Scolaro failed two lie detector tests; a third test was judged inconclusive as to the truth. It was also noted that he tried to deceive the polygraph interviewers in his pre-test interviews. Four years later, a newly elected chief prosecutor in Oakland County, L. Brooks Patterson, believed the Robison crime had originated within his jurisdiction and reopened the prosecution. When the prime suspect Scolaro learned of the impending charges and arrest, he committed suicide on March 8, 1973. Scolaro left behind a typewritten note on which he wrote \\"I am a lier [sic]‚Äîa cheat‚Äîa phony\\" with a list of people he had swindled in multiple business schemes. He then added a handwritten note to his mother on the same sheet of paper saying \\"I had nothing to do with the Robisons‚ÄîI'm a liar but not a murderer‚ÄîI'm sick and scared‚ÄîGod and everyone please forgive me.\\" Since Michigan law does not permit an open murder case to be officially closed, the suicide of the prime suspect Scolaro placed the case in the inactive file. Thus, many questions remained unanswered. Over many years other crime theories have surfaced but to date none has ever been substantiated. Those who personally knew Mr. Robison were quoted in the two police reports filed on the case as saying they had never known a better family man, friend, or business partner.

She was the first child of King Leopold III of Belgium, and sister of the late King Baudouin and former King Albert II and aunt of King Philippe. She was also the first cousin of King Harald V of Norway. Childhood Jos√©phine-Charlotte was born in 1927 at the Royal Palace of Brussels. She was the oldest child and only daughter of the King Leopold III of Belgium and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. She was christened a month after her birth. Her godfather was her uncle, Prince Charles, Count of Flanders and her godmother was her future mother-in-law, Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg. While expecting her daughter, Astrid had read a biography of her ancestress, the French empress Jos√©phine de Beauharnais. Josephine was also the name of one of the child's great-aunts, Princess Jos√©phine-Caroline of Belgium, the dearest sister of King Albert I. Astrid was a devoted mother to her \\"little Jo\\". The young Princess spent her childhood at the Stuyvenberg Palace just outside Brussels with her parents. She was the sister of Belgian monarchs Baudouin and Albert II. Jos√©phine-Charlotte's popular mother was killed in an automobile accident in 1935 at age 29. After her mother's death, Jos√©phine-Charlotte tried to take care of her younger brothers, Baudouin and Albert. The Belgian public extended their enormous sympathies onto the grieving family, with great concern given to the effects it had on Jos√©phine-Charlotte and her brothers. King Leopold remained a devoted father to his children and kept close ties with his late wife's family. Many photographs exist from this time of the children with their Swedish grandparents and Norwegian cousins. Later, in 1941, her father remarried to Mary Lilian Baels (later became Princess of R√©thy). This marriage produced three more children: Prince Alexandre, Princess Marie-Christine and Princess Marie-Esm√©ralda. Jos√©phine-Charlotte had a close relationship with Lilian before her marriage to Jean of Luxembourg. Jos√©phine- Charlotte became the godmother to her younger half-brother, Alexandre. Education Princess Jos√©phine-Charlotte first attended school at the Royal Palace, where a small class had been organized for her. At the end of 1940, she entered a boarding school and then continued her education with her own private teachers. On 7 June 1944, the day after the Allied Forces landed in Normandy, France, she and her father were sent to Germany and kept there under house arrest. The Royal Family, which included her brothers Baudouin and Albert and their stepmother, Mary Lilian Baels, Princess of R√©thy, was freed on 7 May 1945 and settled in Pr√©gny, Switzerland. Princess Jos√©phine-Charlotte continued her studies at the Ecole Sup√©rieure de Jeunes Filles in Geneva, Switzerland. Afterwards, she took Jean Piaget's lectures on child psychology at the University of Geneva. When she returned to Belgium the princess took up her official duties. At the same time, she also devoted herself to social problems and developed her interest in the arts. Marriage Jos√©phine Charlotte was joined in marriage on 9 April 1953 in Luxembourg to Prince Jean, who at the time was The Hereditary Grand Duke and heir-apparent to the throne of Luxembourg. During their 52-year marriage, the royal couple had five children: *Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg (b. 17 February 1954) *Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (b. 16 April 1955) *Prince Jean of Luxembourg (b. 15 May 1957) *Princess Margaretha of Luxembourg (b. 15 May 1957) *Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg (b. 1 May 1963) As a princess in the royal house of Belgium, Jos√©phine Charlotte brought a wealth of elegance, taste and refinement to her new homeland. She carried out many social, cultural and humanitarian duties. She focused on several initiatives that she would ardently support, particularly matters pertaining to children and families. She was also president of the Luxembourg Youth Section of the Red Cross. She also served as honorary president of the Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra, and president of the Luxembourg Red Cross. The Grand Duchess also oversaw the restoration of the Grand Ducal Palace from 1991 until 1996. Her favorite hobbies included gardening and horticulture. She also enjoyed hunting, fishing, skiing and other watersports. The Grand Duchess, who suffered from lung cancer for a long time, died at her home, Fischbach Castle, at the age of 77. Legacy Jos√©phine-Charlotte metro station in Brussels is named after her. One of her wedding gifts was a diamond tiara, given by the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. This is now part of the Luxembourg reigning family's jewel collection.

This page follows discussion of each genre with a list of works in Japanese or international popular culture that borrow significantly from Shinto myths, deities, and beliefs. It is not an exhaustive list of the many games, movies, manga and other cultural products that mention the religion or the names of its deities. Shinto itself features in popular culture as folk Shinto or Minkan Shinto. Anime and manga Shinto motifs and themes such as kami (gods or spirits) are particularly present in anime and manga. *In Dream Saga, the Earth is destroyed and recreated whenever humans have polluted it. This is done when Susanoo, the shinto god of the sea and storms, (the brother to Amaterasu) consumes Amaterasu, the sun goddess. The two main characters, Yuuki and Takaomi, are given key roles in the process. *In the manga Urusei Yatsura, a parody of the famous story of Amaterasu hiding in Ama-no-Iwato cave is performed, which ends when the gods decide they enjoy the burlesque spectacle outside the cave so much, they lock Amaterasu inside. *Susanoo the Brawler is an episodic comic by Elizabeth Watasin, appearing in Action Girl Comics, in which many members of the Japanese pantheon are incarnated as teenage girls. *In the manga and anime series, Naruto there is a list of Mangekyo Sharingan Jutsus named for various Shinto gods. Film Some Japanese films feature themes from Shinto religion or characters based on kami. This is especially the case in animated films, such as Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away, but can also be seen in live action and tokusatsu (special- effects driven) films. *In the 2003 film Onmyoji II, the story of Amaterasu (played by Ky≈çko Fukada) is revisited when the main character, based on Abe no Seimei (played by Mansai Nomura), assumes the role of the dancer in bringing the goddess back to earth. Susanoo is also a character in the film, played by Hayato Ichihara. *In the Stargate series, Amaterasu is a Goa'uld System Lord who comes to Earth with Lord Yu and Camulus to form a temporary truce between Earth and the Goa'uld. *In The Three Treasures Toshir≈ç Mifune portrays Susanoo. *In Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon Susanoo wishes to follow his mother, Izanami, to heaven when she dies, but his father, Izanagi, tells him he cannot. Video games Video games may relate to themes or characters from Shinto, as well as Buddhism, Christianity, and other religions. Such games may present a heterodox or alternative take on religion, or even parody traditional practice or belief. In addition to Shinto stories or kami, themes such as the sacredness of nature or the place of magic in everyday life are also visible in such games. *In the 2006 video game ≈åkami, Amaterasu is depicted as a white wolf and she is the main protagonist of the game. As in the traditional Shinto, Amaterasu is the goddess of the sun, but in the game she controls many other powers as well by painting things. This depiction of Amaterasu is also a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. *The Shin Megami Tensei Series have several references to Shinto and religion in general. Starting from a name that translates as True Goddess Reincarnation, to god Kagutsuchi in Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne. *In 2016, Amaterasu, Raijin, Susano, and Izanami were included as playable characters in the multiplayer online battle arena video game Smite. *In the video game Destiny, the Susanoo Fusion Rifle made an appearance as a Warlock exclusive weapon with the release of The Taken King expansion. The flavor text for this gun reads \\"The fearsome Storms of Today become the healing waters of tomorrow\\". This gun came out with the Stormcaller class, alluding to Susanoo's status as a storm deity. *In the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV, Susanoo appears as a primal boss fight in the second expansion, Stormblood, as the first primal that the player faces in the story. Tsukuyomi is also fought later on, during the story content after the end of the expansion's main story. Other works of popular culture Shinto stories or kami also appear in other works of popular culture, including work set in Japan but produced outside of the country. *The Shinto deities Izanami and Izanagi (the latter incorrectly spelled as \\"Izaghi\\") appear in Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly. *The Shinto deities Izanami and Izanagi (spelled \\"Izanaki\\") appear in Natsuo Kirino's The Goddess Chronicle. *In the novel, Giles Goat- Boy, author John Barth makes reference to the people of Japan as the \\"Amaterasu,\\" who were EATEN by WESCAC (a reference to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) during the \\"Second Campus Riot\\" (World War II). *Izanagi and Izanami appear as minor supporting characters in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures comic book series, aiding the Turtles and their allies in battle against a powerful demon whose emergence from a damaged nuclear reactor threatens the safety of all Japan.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures #28: \\"Midnight Sun\\", Part 1 (January 1992)Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures #30: \\"Midnight Sun\\", Part 3 (March 1992) References ","title":"Shinto in popular culture"},{"id":"23883390","title":"List of airlines of Panama"},{"id":"23883392","text":"Close up photograph of the flowers Grevillea eriostachya, also known as the yellow flame grevillea and the desert grevillea, is a shrub found in Western Australia, the south-west areas of the Northern Territory, and the north-west areas of South Australia.

History System conflict theory argues that worries over fame, promotions, wages, and success cause the criminal justice system to conflict with itself. This perspective argues that there is no true system and points to the role of adversarial processes, in particular, which are seen to be basic to the \\"system\\", and the fact that many criminal justice organizations habitually share as little information as possible. This school of thought is followed both by groups which argue that the conflict model is the reality of criminal justice, but the consensus model is the ideal; and groups which argue that the conflict model is both the reality and the ideal. Jerome Herbert Skolnick has argued that clearance rates demonstrate the reality of the Conflict Model by encouraging police to focus on appearing to do their job, rather than on actually doing their job. This is a comparable argument to that regarding standardized testing, and \\"teaching to the test\\". Skolnick noted one incident where police coerced a man to confess to over 400 burglaries so that they could have a high rate of crime solving (clearance).

Johnson. Set in Chicago, where Johnson himself lived for a time, this story addresses the corrupting power of money and wealth, and the problem of \\"hoarding\\", which is accumulating food, money, and other things for future use, as two brothers steal from a deceased woman, whose outward signs of poverty and begging belied her true nature: a rich, yet cheap, woman who hid her wealth away.  Plot summary  Loftis and \\"Cooter\\" are two young brothers living in a Chicago apartment, who although do not generally take a part of criminal activity, set out to rob their next door neighbor Miss Elnora Bailey. Bailey, who only leaves her apartment at night to ask for food handouts, is a West Indian woman with all the appearances of a beggar. Having not seen Bailey for several days, and seeing her mailbox full, Loftis and Cooter assumed she had left the neighborhood, and would therefore be an easy mark for burglary. Upon breaking into her house from her side window, the brothers first have to bypass several surprising booby traps: boxes of glass set beside the window. Entering Bailey's kitchen and apartment, the brothers are greeted by the smell of putrid garbage, roaches, dirty dishes, and aluminum coffee cans filled with fecal matter as Bailey's toilet had stopped working. Cooter feels disgusted at the setting, and stops when he smells an even more putrid stench; Loftis continues further into the apartment, and discovers, to the brother's surprise and excitement, a literal treasure hoard of money, stocks, alcohol, and more. In addition to the easily transported items like money was a nearly complete \\"Model A Ford,\\" two pianos, multiple sections of a deceased tree, and trash. Cooter immediately has misgivings about both the hoard, and the fact that he and his brother are about to take it, that there was something that just was not right. Loftis takes Cooter into Bailey's bedroom where they find Bailey dead and decaying in her bed, grotesquely being consumed by maggots and a single rat. Cooter faints, and Loftis drags him back to the living room, discovering a newspaper clipping beside Bailey's bed that shows the brothers how Bailey had earned her wealth. Working for an old rich family for over twenty years, Bailey had been willed their entire estate upon their death, and had been rich and wealthy for longer than both Cooter and Loftis had been alive. Although Cooter still expresses misgivings about stealing the hoard of wealth from a woman who chose not to spend any of it, Loftis insists, and eventually they tote Bailey's goods back into their apartment. Totally in cash there was almost 900,000 dollars, in addition to bank books, and other odds and ends which the brothers could exchange for even more money. Cooter feels excited at the new future this property gives him and his brother, how they are set for life. Cooter takes off and purchases a fine leather jacket and suit immediately, and explores the city in celebration as Loftis unusually stays home, appearing thoughtful. Upon returning home, Cooter is forced to enter through an unusual set of booby traps, much like the ones Bailey had set up in her apartment, and is beaten and scolded by Loftis for spending some of the money the two have stolen. Loftis additionally had taken trash into their apartment, and takes off for work, even though the two have stolen almost 900,000 dollars in cash. After Loftis leaves for work, Cooter watches as Miss Bailey‚Äôs death is discovered by their landlord, and watches as they depart with her corpse. Loftis does not come home at the normal time he would from work, and actually does not come home for several days. As the days pass, the home of the brothers falls into similar disrepair that Bailey‚Äôs did, their toilet stops working, and they run out of their own food. With fear of discovery, they cannot call a repairman to fix the toilet, and Cooter fears using Bailey‚Äôs food, so he is forced to resort to begging, at the same place that Bailey had to beg for food. Finally, four days after Loftis left for work, he returns home, with a haunted look, stumbling into his bedroom. Walking after him, Cooter finds him asleep, his face haunted. Beside his bedstand Cooter finds a single penny wrapped in a newspaper with the words \\"Found while walking down Devon Avenue.\\" Haunted, Cooter considers to himself that Loftis, and indirectly, himself, are mirroring Bailey‚Äôs actions before her death; so caught up by the possibilities of what their newfound wealth can bring, they refuse to spend it, not wanting to give up any of their newly found hope, their newly found future. However, by refusing to sacrifice any of the money to pursue that future, they sacrifice the \\"future\\" they have been craving and desiring.  Sources  *American Gothic Tales.

It was completed in the 1750s and named Fort Augusta in honour of the mother of King George III. In 1763 lightning struck the fort and its three thousand barrels of gunpowder causing an explosion that broke windows 17 miles away and killed three hundred people. The shocks created a crater which had to be filled before reconstruction could begin. During the American Revolution the fort was occupied by the Duke of Cumberland's Regiment. The remains of the fortress now consists of massive crumbling walls of brick that have been fortified with other materials (including barbed wire). Some years ago, the DCS sold the land on which Fort Augusta sits to the Port Authority of Jamaica.

Its corporate headquarters was in Paris, and it had development centers in Metz, FrancePresentation, slide 4 and Curitiba, Brazil. Mandriva, S.A. was the developer and maintainer of a Linux distribution called Mandriva Linux, as well as various enterprise software products. Mandriva was a founding member of the Desktop Linux Consortium. History Mandriva, S.A. began as MandrakeSoft in 1998. In February 2004, following lengthy litigation with the Hearst Corporation over the name \\"Mandrake\\" (the Hearst Corporation owned a comic strip called Mandrake the Magician), MandrakeSoft was required to change its name. Following the acquisition of the Brazilian Linux distribution Conectiva in February 2005, the company's name was changed on 7 April 2005 to \\"Mandriva\\" to reflect the names \\"MandrakeSoft\\" and \\"Conectiva.\\" On October 4, 2004, MandrakeSoft acquired the professional support company Edge IT, which focused on the corporate market in France and had 6 employees. On June 15, 2005, Mandriva acquired Lycoris (formerly, Redmond Linux Corporation). On October 5, 2006, Mandriva signed an agreement to acquire Linbox, a Linux enterprise software infrastructure company. The agreement included the acquisition of all shares of Linbox for a total of $1.739 million in Mandriva stock, plus an earn out of up to $401,000 based on the 2006 Linbox financials. In 2007, Mandriva reached a deal with the Government of Nigeria to put their operating system on 17,000 school computers. On January 16, 2008, Mandriva and Turbolinux announced a partnership to create a lab named Manbo- Labs, to share resources and technology to release a common base system for both companies' Linux distributions.Mandriva and Turbolinux announce a partnership and create a joint development lab called Manbo-Labs Although Mandriva's operating system eventually became a significant entity in the data center, the company's operating margins were thin and by 2012 the company was on the brink of bankruptcy.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/linux-company- spent-17-years-171430998.html On January 30, 2012, Mandriva announced that an external entity bid was rejected by a minority share holder and the deal did not go through. At the end of the first semester 2012, a solution to the situation that had appeared in January of the same year was found and a settlement achieved. Mandriva was subsequently owned by several different shareholders. Mandriva filed for administrative receivership in early 2015, and was liquidated on May 22, 2015. The Mandriva Linux distribution continues to survive as OpenMandriva Lx. Notable forks include Mageia Linux and ROSA Linux. Mandriva Club In addition to selling Linux distributions through its online store and authorized resellers, Mandriva previously sold subscriptions to the Mandriva Club. There were several levels of membership, at costs ranging from US$66 or ‚Ç¨60 per year (as of 2007) to ‚Ç¨600 per year. Club members gained access to the Club website, additional mirrors and torrents for downloading, free downloads of its boxed products (depending on membership level), interim releases of the Mandriva Linux distribution, and additional software updates. For example, only Gold-level and higher members could download Powerpack+ editions. Many Mandriva commercial products came with short-term membership in the club; however, Mandriva Linux was completely usable without a club membership. When Mandriva Linux 2008.0 was released in October 2007, Mandriva made club membership free of charge to all comers, splitting download subscriptions off into a separate service.

Geography The municipal area stretches on a sandy terrace in the Berlin-Warsaw glacial valley (Urstromtal). It is bounded by the Oder river in the east, which since 1945 has formed the German‚ÄìPolish border. Eisenh√ºttenstadt is the eastern terminus of the Oder‚ÄìSpree Canal. The town centre is located about south of Frankfurt (Oder) and southeast of Berlin. Eisenh√ºttenstadt has access to the Berlin‚ÄìWroc≈Çaw railway line. The town comprises the districts of Diehlo, F√ºrstenberg (Oder), and Sch√∂nflie√ü. History The present-day town was founded as a socialist model city in 1950 (initially named Stalinstadt after Joseph Stalin) following a decision by the East German Socialist Unity Party (SED), alongside a new steel mill combine located west of the historic town of F√ºrstenberg (Oder). A few years before the new town was established, a bridge over the Oder river had been constructed, the earlier one having been destroyed by retreating Wehrmacht forces in February 1945, near the end of World War II. The population grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1961, during de-Stalinization, the town was renamed Eisenh√ºttenstadt. After German reunification in 1990, the state-owned steel works were privatized, and most of its 12,000 employees lost their jobs. Thereafter the factory employed around 2,500 workers. The town experienced a steep decline in population, from just over 50,000 to under 30,000.

We have no objections for the use of our intellectual property in the public domain, as long as proper citation is given. Biography Bodufenvalhuge Sidi, born on 19 May 1888 as Hussain el-Hussaini, was the son of Bodufenvalhuge Don Manike and Mohamed Kuda Sidi. He was a poet, and also at one time chief justice. He married eight ladies and had five surviving children from four of these marriages. His first wife was Bodugalhuge Aysha Didi, daughter of Bodugaluge Lhatuttu Didi. Among his descendants are Ahmed Mujuthaba and Mohamed Mustafa, who are both prominent in Maldivian administration and politics. Sidi spent several years of his youth in Addu Atoll with his maternal relatives. Addu Atoll was the main centre of learning in the Maldives at that time, the turn of the 20th century. He was educated there by a well-known master and relative, Elhage√¨ Abdullahi Didi, son of Ganduvaru Hasan Didi, also known as Don Beyya of Meedhu. He was credited with many of the developments in Maldivian poetry in the 20th century. He was the last major poet to write in the Maldivian poetic style called raivaru, and one of the first poets to write in the style called lhen. His early poems were mainly political satire. In 1925, an attempt was made to depose Sultan Muhammad Shamsuddeen III in favour of Prince Abdulla Imaduddin, son of the deposed King Siri Kula Sundhura Katthiri Bavana (Sultan Muhammad Imaaduddeen VI). The deposed king was exiled in Egypt while Abdulla Imaduddine was on a visit to Mal√© from Egypt. The attempt was foiled in February 1925 and Abdulla Imaduddine was deported to Egypt. The other conspirators were banished to various atolls of the Maldives. Sidi, the most well-educated and widely respected of the conspirators, was accused of masterminding the plot. He denied the charge and claimed that he advised strongly against the timing and the modus operandi in the plot. He engaged in a hunger strike and refused to answer any questions, saying that he had done nothing wrong. After he had agreed to take his food, he insisted on homemade food. He was successful in having this wish granted, and at every meal time his brother-in-law Beruge Yoosuf Fulhu turned up with his meals and waited there while he ate. Bodufenvalhuge Sidi was implying that he did not trust the Maldivian authorities. In such cases the authorities usually meted out summary justice. The victim would be taken outside and given a thorough flogging with a cat-o-nine-tails until he was covered in blood, then lonumirus (chilli paste) would be applied to his wounds and he would be banished to a remote island. In Sidi's case they were reluctant to do so because the British had become aware of the situation. The Maldives was then a British protectorate even though the British were bound by a treaty not to interfere in internal affairs.Iyye, Yesterday - An unsuccessful revolt in an attempt to regain rule; Abdul Hakeem Hussein Manik Bodufenvalhuge Sidi was banished to Hulhudheli in a southern atoll. Many of his maternal relatives from Addu Atoll regularly stopped at that island for provisions and water on their way to and from Mal√©. The authorities became suspicious and decided to send him to Maamakunudhu, the remotest of the northern islands. In exile in Maamakunudhu, he continued to pursue his literary work and wrote much of his poetry. It was there that he adopted his pen name of \\"Himaarul Qowm\\" or \\"Donkey of the Nation\\". He distributed his poetry, then banned by the government, to his associates in Mal√© through an ex-wife, Maavaa Kileygefaanu Ganduvaru Goma, and his sister Bodufenvalhuge Don Didi. Sidi remained on Maamakunudu Island for eight years until he was pardoned in a general amnesty following the forced abdication of King Shamsuddin. Upon arrival in Mal√© he was appointed Chief Justice. He was also appointed to the Council of Regency that ruled in the absence of a sultan. After returning to Mal√©, he continued to write poetry and a few novels and other books. He was the last known person with a working knowledge of the older Maldive script called Dhives Akuru. Sidi was one of the very few Maldivian people of modern times who understood the now-forgotten ancient Divehi letters in which parts of royal grants, warrants and deeds were written. He learnt this ancient Dhivehi writing systems in Addu Atoll. Until early in the twentieth century, all government correspondence to and from Addu Atoll was written using these ancient Divehi letters. Apart from a stint in politics as the Minister of Education, Bodufenvalhuge Sidi remained in the legal/ecclesiastical professions. His literary work gradually became less radical and more conventional with age. Bodufenvalhuge Sidi died in Mal√© on 2 June 1970. Works Best known among his novels were Dillygey Ibrahim Didi ge Vaahaka and Maa Makunudu Bodu Isa ge Vaahaka. He also published a treatise on Maldive poetry called Divehi Lhen Hedumuge Masaikaiyterikamuge Ran Taraadu. In 1959, during Sultan Mohammed Farid‚Äôs reign, former Prime Minister (and later President) Ibrahim Nasir expressed a wish to have a book written about the former Maldivian script, which by that time was largely ignored by Maldivians. Thus, he contacted Sidi, who swiftly obliged and wrote Dhivehi Akuru. By means of this small book Sidi wanted to clearly show that in ancient times Maldivians were writing from left to right in their own script. Hence, Dhivehi Akuru is perhaps the only book ever written in Thaana that opens from the left side. The last chapter of this book shows a text where the Divehi Akuru are accompanied with Arabic script. As the reader acquainted with Maldivian writing can see, this book is Volume 1 (evvana bai). Perhaps Sidi intended to publishing a second, or perhaps even a third volume on the subject, but unfortunately this important Maldivian learned man died before being able to do so.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom. Barcelona 1999. Even though H.C.P. Bell did a very careful and thorough research on the Maldivian documents, Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir‚Äôs intention was to have a book on the ancient script of the Maldives written by a Maldivian. Nasir's request to Sidi was done in order to clarify Bell‚Äôs misinterpretations, no matter how few. A staunch Maldivian nationalist, Nasir took this issue as a matter of national pride. Present day members of Maldivian cultural institutions are aware of the lacunae in Bell's research and of Sidi's valuable contribution to mend matters, but little has been done to correct those inaccuracies. Still, Bell‚Äôs broad and valuable contributions to the study of the Maldivian language and scripts should not be underestimated. Notes Bodufenvalhuge Sidi. Divehi Akuru; Evvana Bai. Mal√© 1958.

Biography =Early life= Fraser was born in India, the son of Captain Hugh Fraser of the 5th Madras Light Cavalry. He received his education at Elizabeth College in Guernsey, Victoria College in Jersey, and the Lyc√©e de St Brieuc in Brittany, France. He came to New Zealand in September 1858 for farming. Together with Alfred Rowland Chetham-Strode, he took up Earnscleugh Station on the Earnscleugh River. In 1874, he married Ellen Isabel Strode, the daughter of his business partner, in 1874. =Political career= Fraser was a member of the Otago Provincial Council (1867‚Äì1870). He was a member of the inaugural Vincent County from 1877 until 1893, the last ten years as chairman. He won the Wakatipu electorate in the 1893 general election, and retired in 1919. He served on the Legislative Council from 1919 to 1923 when he died. Under Prime Minister William Massey, he was Minister of Public Works (10 July 1912 ‚Äì 3 April 1920), Minister of Mines (10 July 1912 ‚Äì 12 August 1915; 4 September 1919 ‚Äì 27 July 1920), Minister of Industries and Commerce (10 July 1912 ‚Äì 26 July 1912) and a Member of the Executive Council (without portfolio; 27 July 1920 ‚Äì 16 July 1923). Fraser was widely criticised as Minister of Public Works for using railway branch lines as \\"electoral bait\\" particularly in the South Island and for not adopting new techniques. =Later life and death= He was appointed a Knight Bachelor on 6 February 1918 and, on the occasion of the royal visit by Edward, Prince of Wales to Australia and New Zealand, a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1920. Fraser died on 16 July 1923 at Wellington after a short illness of only three weeks. His wife had died many years before him. William Massey, the Prime Minister, commented on his death: \\"there came to an end one of the most useful careers of this country.\\" His funeral service was held at Old St. Paul's in Wellington, and he was buried at Karori Cemetery.

Mormonism and Christianity have a complex theological, historical, and sociological relationship. Mormons express the doctrines of Mormonism using standard biblical terminology and have similar views about the nature of Jesus' atonement, bodily resurrection, and Second Coming as traditional Christianity. Nevertheless, most Mormons do not accept the Trinitarian views of orthodox Nicene Christianity, codified in the Nicene and Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creeds of 325 and 381. (arguing that \\"Mormonism differs from traditional Christianity in much the same fashion that traditional Christianity ... came to differ from Judaism.\\"). Although Mormons consider the Protestant Bible as scripture, they do not believe in biblical inerrancy. They have also adopted additional scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Mormons practice baptism and celebrate the Sacrament, but they also participate in religious rituals not practiced by traditional Christianity. Mormons self- identify as Christian.Mormons in America: Certain in Their Beliefs, Uncertain of Their Place in Society , Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life 2012, p.10: Mormons are nearly unanimous in describing Mormonism as a Christian religion, with 97% expressing this point of view Focusing on differences, some Christians consider Mormonism \\"non-Christian\\"; Mormons, focusing on similarities, are sometimes offended at being so characterized.. Mormons do not accept non-Mormon baptism nor do non-Mormon Christians usually accept Mormon baptism. Mormons regularly proselytize individuals actually or nominally within the Christian tradition, and some Christians, especially evangelicals, proselytize Mormons. Some view Mormonism as a form of Christianity, but distinct enough from traditional Christianity so as to form a new religious tradition, much as Christianity is more than just a sect of Judaism.. The Mormonism that originated with Joseph Smith in the 1820s shared strong similarities with some elements of nineteenth-century Protestant Christianity.. Mormons believe that God, through Smith and his successors, restored various doctrines and practices that were lost from the original Christianity taught by Jesus. For example, Smith, as a result of his \\"First Vision\\", primarily rejected the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity and instead taught that God the Father, his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are three distinct \\"personages\\". While the largest Mormon denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), acknowledges its differences with mainstream Christianity, it also focuses on its commonalities such as its focus on faith in Christ, following the teachings of Jesus Christ, the miracle of the atonement, and many other doctrines.See, commentary, \\"Real Differences, Real Similarities and Biblical Christianity\\". Mormon News Room. October 11, 2007. Doctrinal comparison While some attribute its roots as part of Protestantism and the Protestant Reformation that was ongoing during the 1820s and 1830s, (\\"Mormonism springs from the sectarian tradition of the Radical Reformation, in fact from its most extreme fringe.\\"). Mormonism was identified as \\"a radical departure from traditional Protestant Christianity\\", (describing Smith's theology as \\"a radical departure from traditional Protestant Christianity\\".) as it never claimed to be a reformed branch of either Catholicism nor any Protestant group. Instead, other historians have described it as one of the Restoration religions. Nonetheless, it was part of the era of the Second Great Awakening. =Early Joseph Smith era= Mormonism arose in the 1820s during a period of radical reform and experimentation within American Protestantism, and Mormonism is integrally connected to that religious environment.; . As a form of Christian primitivism, the new faith was one among several contemporary religious movements that claimed to restore Christianity to its condition at the time of the Twelve Apostles. (describing the background of Christian primitivism in New England). The Book of Mormon The Book of Mormon (1830), which codifies the earliest Mormon doctrine, was intended, in part, to settle ongoing doctrinal disputes among contemporary Christian denominations (\\"The Book of Mormon settles doctrinal differences among those who accept the Christ it presents. Mormon's purpose is to make clear the true doctrine and to dissolve doctrinal disputes by explaining the gospel of Christ\\"); (\\"[T]he Book of Mormon decides controversies in a number of areas, including those argued among early nineteenth century American theologians.\\") and to create a single shared theology. (noting that the Book of Mormon expresses contempt for sectarianism, and arguing that establishing the one true fold and one true faith are the \\"only real theological themes of the book\\"); (the Book of Mormon \\"would seek to heal the wounds of sectarianism and defend God against deism, rationalism, and sectarianism\\".) Joseph Smith believed in the Bible; . and shared the Protestant tradition that the Bible (excluding the Apocrypha) was originally revealed by God to humanity; . and had contained the \\"fulness of the gospel\\". Nevertheless, Smith believed the Bible of his era had degenerated from its original form. Smith blamed the Catholic Church for the loss of biblical books and for introducing corruptions and obfuscations in the biblical text.. Smith said that the Book of Mormon revealed \\"plain and precious things that had been taken away\\" from the Bible.; . Smith also completed an unpublished revision of the Bible in 1833, (noting that though Smith declared his revision of the Bible complete in 1833, though the church lacked funds to publish it during his lifetime). which he said corrected many of these errors,The LDS Church has canonized only a small part of this translation. However, see (noting that the most significant parts of Smith's revision of the Bible are found as footnotes and study materials in the LDS Church edition of the Authorized King James Version). and added inspired commentary. Smith endowed the Book of Mormon with status equal to the Bible. (\\"To defend the Bible's status as revelation, the Book of Mormon demanded equal status.\\") Nature of God Views on the Nature of God in early Mormonism has been a matter of debate. Thomas G. Alexander argues that early Mormon theology was \\"essentially trinitarian\\", (describing the pre-1835 theology as \\"essentially trinitarian\\"); (calling Book of Mormon theology \\"layman's Trinitarianism\\"); (\\"The Book of Mormon, revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants prior to 1835, and Smith's 1832 account of his First Vision all reflect 'trinitarian' perceptions.\\"); (\\"While the Book of Mormon theology does not reflect a truly orthodox trinitarian view as codified in the Athanasian creed, it does reflect the common Christian layman's perception that is some manner, the Father and the Son were both representations of one God.\\"); (noting that Book of Mormon theology was similar to trinitarianism, but ultimately was \\"modalistic Monarchianism\\"). A statement in the Lectures on Faith is used to defend this belief: > There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing, and > supreme power over all things, by whom all things were created and made, > that are created and made. They are the Father and the Son-the Father being > a personage of spirit, glory, and power possessing all perfection and > fullness, the Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of > tabernacle. Robert L. Millet suggests that Smith simply had not had God's physical nature revealed to him when he gave the lecture: > It is possible that Joseph Smith simply did not understand the corporeal or > physical nature of God at the time the Lectures on Faith were delivered. His > knowledge of things-like that of all men and women-was often incremental, > and his development in understanding was therefore a \\"line upon line\\" > development. As a result of the First Vision, the boy prophet knew that the > heavens were no longer sealed; that satan was more than myth or metaphor; > and that the Father and Son were separate and distinct personages. Millet also argues that a statement by Truman Coe in 1836 reinforces the idea that early Mormon doctrine differed from the orthodox Protestantism of the day: > They (The Mormons) believe that the true God is a material being, composed > of body and parts; and that when the Creator formed Adam in his own image, > he made him about the size and shape of God himself. Kurt Widmer stated that \\"early Mormons were reacting against a heavily intellectualized and theologized Trinitarian concept of God\\" and the nature of God was not at first of central importance to Smith. (\\"What is apparent is that early Mormons were reacting against a heavily intellectualized and theologized Trinitarian concept of God.\\"). Other points of doctrine Early Mormon soteriology, although not following a preexisting tradition, was generally Arminian in tendency. (noting that early Mormon doctrine \\"saw man as a creature of God, but capable of sanctification\\"); (noting similarities with Arminianism, and disagreeing that the Book of Mormon incorporates Calvinist doctrine); (arguing that while the Book of Mormon agrees with some tenets of Arminianism, it \\"integrates doctrines from a variety of preexisting theological perspectives and some apparently unique teachings\\"). Early Mormonism agreed with Methodists and the Disciples of Christ in rejecting Calvinistic doctrines in favor of Christian perfection and free will (called free agency).; (noting, in addition, that the \\"Book of Mormon seems to contradict all five points of Calvinism\\"); (\\"[I]n the debate over human freedom, the Book of Mormon tends to resolve the issues similarly but not identically to the Methodist brand of Arminianism.\\"). Also, while the Book of Mormon affirmed the doctrine of original sin, (Book of Mormon \\"affirms original sin (2 Ne. 2), [and] human depravity (Mosiah 16:3) ...\\"); ; (\\"[A]lthough the Book of Mormon promulgates a notion of 'original sin', it is a 'hypothetical original sin' which does not actually afflict persons unless they reject the atonement.\\"); (describing the Book of Mormon as pessimistic about fundamental human nature, and the inability to overcome depravity through willfulness alone). it also agrees with other Arminian denominations that children are incapable of sin and in a state of grace. Like other Christian primitivists, Smith located the authority of Christianity in correct interpretation of the Bible (comparing the earliest Mormonism with the Disciples of Christ's view of Biblical authority).‚Äîalthough he also maintained (as did the Shakers) that interpretation of the Bible should be guided by new and continuing revelation. (\\"Like Shakers, [Smith] would restore the church and be led to the correct interpretation by new and constant revelation.\\") Initially, the authority of Smith's faith was based on correct doctrine (\\"Like other Protestants, he would see correct doctrine as a mark of the true church.\\") and his own claim of prophethood. (describing Smith's earliest authority as charismatic authority); (noting that Smith based his authority, in part, on signs of divine approbation and special revelations, and that \\"[a]t first the Prophet had little to offer [converts] beyond baptism and his own impressive personality.\\") Then during the early 1830s, Smith added to this authority apostolic succession, represented by angelic apostles and prophets who Smith said had ordained him. (\\"Like other Protestants, he would see correct doctrine as a mark of the true church. But Smith added something else: a new scripture and a dual priesthood based not on apostolic succession, as in the case of the Roman Catholic claim to authority, but on prophetic succession.\\"); (Smith \\"claimed prophetic succession through a dual priesthood that allegedly existed among the Hebrews.\\"); (In 1834, Smith first began claiming that his authority arose within a line of succession through angelic visitors.). =Late‚ÄìJoseph Smith era= From the mid-1830s to his death in 1844, Smith continued to introduce ideas and practices which differed significantly from traditional Protestantism. First, Smith pressed Christian perfection beyond Protestant orthodoxy.. He followed non-Protestant Christians in rejecting the doctrine of justification by faith alone (\\"Mormonism as it evolved between Kirtland, Ohio and Nauvoo, Illinois, also rejected the pre- eminence of faith over works.\\"). and moved toward universalism by introducing a hierarchy of three glorious heavens, in which even the wicked had a place. (\\"[E]ven the 'liars, sorcerers, adulterers, and whoremongers' were guaranteed telestial glory, and only a handful of unregenerates called the Sons of Perdition were to be eternally damned.\\") In the late 1830s, Smith introduced baptism for the dead by proxy as a means for unredeemed souls to accept salvation in the afterlife,; . and he also taught that the ordinance of marriage was required to reach the highest level of salvation.; ; (noting that a modern Mormon interpretation of Smith's 1843 polygamy revelation ties both polygamy and monogamy to degrees of exaltation). Smith also introduced a second anointing ritual, after which a participant was guaranteed virtually unconditional salvation. This has been seen as an attempt to retain the Calvinistic ideas of assured salvation.; (Second anointing was Smith's \\"attempt to deal with the theological problem of assurance\\" over which Calvinist theologians had argued for centuries.); (arguing that unlike Calvinism, the power to grant unconditional salvation resided in the priest, rather than God alone, and therefore incorporated elements of Smith's magical tradition); (noting differences with the Calvinistic notion of persevering grace); (Unlike other Mormon rituals necessary for salvation, \\"the second anointing guaranteed one's exaltation, and thus may be viewed as the crowning ordinance of Smith's ministry.\\") In his later years Smith also differed from traditional Protestantism in his views on the nature of God and humanity. Eventually Smith reduced the difference between God and man to one of degree. Both God and man are coeternal and uncreated. He taught that humans could progress to an exalted state in which they became coequal with a God who was material, plural, and himself a glorified man existing within time.. (\\"To the older New England the ways and 'providences' of God were inscrutable. To a rebellious son of New England, living in an age of secret societies with strange signs and special ceremonies, God was quite scrutable, but only to those who were initiated.\\");; (describing Smith's doctrine as \\"material anthropomorphism\\"); (\\"Smith's God, after all, began as a man, and struggled heroically in and with time and space, rather after the pattern of colonial and revolutionary Americans.\\") (\\"Piece by piece, Joseph redefined the nature of God, giving Him a form and a body and locating Him in time and space.\\"); (\\"Joseph Smith's God ... is finite. ... Exalted now into the heavens, God necessarily is still subject to the contingencies of time and space.\\"). Smith taught that both God the Father and Jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies, and that the Holy Spirit was a personage of Spirit.. Because God had once been a man who had risen to a high position in heaven,; (discussing instances where Smith taught that God was a resurrected man). humans too could progress to godhood. Such a teaching implied a vast hierarchy of gods who would rule kingdoms of inferior intelligences, and so forth in an eternal hierarchy.; Unlike the god of traditional Christianity, the god envisioned by Smith did not create the eternal spirits of humanity‚Äîhe only organized them and provided them with a plan to follow in his footsteps.; . God was God not because he was an ex nihilo creator, but because he had the greatest intelligence.. =Pioneer Mormonism= After Smith's death, his successor Brigham Young and others built upon Smith's late teachings and introduced more significant doctrinal innovations. The resulting religious tradition defined the Mormonism of the Mormon pioneer era in the 19th century. An important part of this pioneer Mormonism is the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine, which became the most prominent (but not exclusive) theology of 19th-century Mormonism.. Young taught that God the Father was Adam, a mortal man resurrected and exalted to godhood.. Proponents of this doctrine believed that Father Adam, as the subordinate member of a three-god council, created the earth. (describing Michael as a \\"lesser God in the Council of Gods\\".); (noting that in Joseph Smith's endowment ceremony, the gods involved in the creation were \\"Elohim, Jehovah, and Michael\\", but unlike in modern Mormon theology, this \\"Jehovah\\" was not identified as Jesus). Adam was both the common ancestor and the father of all spirits born on the earth. (describing the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine as \\"that Adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world, including Jesus Christ\\"); (Adam \\"was the father of the spirits in Heaven, as well as the father of their mortal bodies.\\").; (Young apparently believed that while Adam was mortal on the earth, his father Elohim, the \\"Grandfather in Heaven\\", temporarily took over Adam's role as the god of this planet). After ascending again to his heavenly throne, (\\"After his death Adam returned to his exalted station as God the Father, and as such presided over Israel designated by the divine names Elohim or Jehovah.\\"). Adam returned to physically father Jesus by Mary.; (describing the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine as \\"that Adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world, including Jesus Christ\\"); (Adam \\"later begot Jesus, his firstborn spirit son, in the flesh\\"). Some elements of Mormonism from the pioneer era, including polygamy and the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine, were renounced around the turn of the 20th century by the LDS Church.; (noting that in 1912, the LDS First Presidency explicitly instructed missionaries to teach that Mormons worship God the Father, and not Adam, and discussing the official First Presidency statement of 1916). However, these elements have been retained within the small branch of Mormonism known as Mormon fundamentalism. =Modern LDS Church orthodoxy= Near the turn of the 20th century there was a movement to codify LDS theology with official statements of Church leaders ‚Äî which served to quash speculative ideas that persisted as sub rosa concepts among some Mormons. This coincided with an effort to stop new plural marriages ‚Äî mostly forbidden in 1890 and completely forbidden after 1904. Prominent Mormons such as Joseph F. Smith, John A. Widstoe, and James E. Talmage formulated the outlines of Mormon orthodoxy with publications that significantly narrowed the realm of acceptable speculative Mormon theology. Nature of God and humanity In traditional Christianity, as expressed in the Athanasian Creed, God is conceived both as a unity and a Trinity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are described as three persons of one uncreated divine being, equally infinite, eternal, and unchangeable. Though modern Mormons share with traditional Christianity a belief that the object of their worship comprises three distinct persons, Mormon theology disagrees with the idea that the three persons are the same being. Mormons are constrained by the language of the Book of Mormon to regard the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as \\"one\\", but consider this a social unity rather than ontological. Mormons since the time of Joseph Smith have regarded God as plural.:\\"This image of God reinforces Dan Vogel's argument that 'Mormonism was never trinitarian but consistently preferred heterodox definitions of God.'\\" ; (developing from monotheism in the late 1820s and 30s, LDS Church theology was clearly tritheistic by 1916). They regard God the Father as the biblical god Elohim, and they believe that the Son, a distinct being, is both Jesus and the biblical God Jehovah. (Jesus is regarded as Jehovah, the Old Testament god). The two of them, together with the Holy Spirit, are believed to form a heavenly council which Mormons call the \\"Godhead\\". They are \\"one\\" in the sense of being lovingly united in purpose or will, a view sometimes called social trinitarianism.Mormons believe in what is sometimes called \\"social trinitarianism\\", meaning the three beings of the Godhead are blended in heart and mind like extremely close friends, but are not one being.\\" Unlike traditional Christians, modern Mormons generally regard the Son as subordinate to the Father. (In contrast to Christian orthodoxy, \\"[t]he Mormon Jesus is subordinate to the Father.\\"). Mormons since the 1840s have believed that God is changeable. They believe that the Father (like the Son) was twice \\"born\\"‚Äîonce as a spirit, and again as a mortal man. (Mormons believe that God was once a man.). After he lived a mortal life, Mormons believe that the Father died, was resurrected, and achieved his godhood; (discussing instances where Smith taught that God was a resurrected man);; (\\"Smith's God, after all, began as a man, and struggled heroically in and with time and space, rather after the pattern of colonial and revolutionary Americans.\\"); along with at least one wife whom Mormons refer to as the Heavenly Mother. (Roberts and Widtsoe taught that \\"We must also have a mother who possesses the attributes of Godhood.\\"). Some believe that the Heavenly Father and Mother gave birth to the spirits of humanity through a sexual union. (20th century Mormon theologians retained Young's idea that spirit children were born in the same way that material children are born); (noting the Heavenly Mother doctrine, Roberts and Widtsoe taught that \\"[s]exual relations will continue into eternity both for joy and for procreation.\\") Modern Mormons believe that Jesus, the Son, was the first born of these spirits. (Mormon doctrine is that humans are born of a heavenly Father and Mother; Jesus is described as \\"literally our elder brother\\"). While Mormons might agree with the statement that the Father and the Son are \\"uncreated\\", their understanding of \\"creation\\" differs from that of traditional Christianity. Mormons do not believe, as do traditional Christians, that God created the universe ex nihilo (from nothing). Rather, to Mormons, the act of creation is to organize or reorganize pre-existing matter or intelligence. Traditional Christians consider God to be a \\"necessary being\\", meaning that he cannot not exist, while all other creations are \\"contingent beings\\". In Mormonism, by contrast, God created the universe and everything in it from existing matter. The Mormon sense of \\"eternal\\" differs from that of traditional Christians, who believe that God's eternal nature exists outside of space and time. Very few in the LDS Church situate God outside of space and time. (\\"Piece by piece, Joseph redefined the nature of God, giving Him a form and a body and locating Him in time and space.\\"); ; (\\"The Mormon God exists within time; in traditional Christian theology, God is outside time.\\"); Robson K (1992, \\"Time and Eternity\\"), Encyclopedia of Mormonism However, Mormon scripture states that \\"time is measured only unto man.\\"The Will of the Father in All Things, Jeffrey R. Holland (BYU president), 17 January 1989; (mis-)quoting Alma 40:8. Book of Mormon They believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are co-eternal, and they believe that all of humanity is co-eternal with the Father (Mormon doctrine is that humans are coeternal with God, are of the same species. in the sense that the underlying spark of all intelligence has always existed (in space and time) and never was created. Mormons believe that God is scrutable through revelation, (\\"To the older New England the ways and 'providences' of God were inscrutable. To a rebellious son of New England, living in an age of secret societies with strange signs and special ceremonies, God was quite scrutable, but only to those who were initiated.\\") and anthropomorphic, (describing Smith's doctrine as \\"material anthropomorphism\\"); ; (\\"Mormon tradition, from Joseph Smith on, has tended to interpret literally ... anthropomorphic descriptions of God.\\"). in that he has a physical body of flesh and bone. Mormons believe in traditional Christian notions that God is omnipotent and omniscient, and also believe that \\"[e]ven God's omnipotence must conform to the attributes of truth and wisdom and justice and mercy\\".. Salvation Although the LDS Church has never officially adopted a doctrine of soteriology, (discussing reasons why the LDS Church never issued an official soteriological statement based on the writings of Roberts, Widtsoe, and Talmage). most Mormons accept the doctrine of salvation formulated by B. H. Roberts, John A. Widstoe, and James E. Talmage in the early 20th century. (The soteriological orthodoxy created by Roberts, Widtsoe, and Talmage remained unchallenged until the advent of neo- orthodoxy). In contrast to early Mormons, modern Mormons generally reject the idea of original sin.; (The rejection of original sin is a reversal of ideas implicit in the Book of Mormon.); (\\"All Mormon factions agree that LDS theology rejects the orthodox Christian doctrine of original sin.\\"). The Fall of Man is viewed not as a curse but as part of God's Plan of Salvation.Gerald N. Lund, \\"The Fall of Man and His Redemption\\", Ensign, January 1990.; (arguing that this Mormon orthodoxy \\"implies that the Fall is no fall\\".); ; (\\"Mormons believe that Adam's fall was a good thing, not the tragic event of traditional Christian understanding.\\"). Mormons believe they must not only have faith and repent but also be baptized (by immersion and by an authorised priesthood holder within the Church) and bring forth good works.James 2:26; . Mormons consider their weekly Eucharist (the Sacrament) as a means of renewing their baptismal covenant and being repeatedly cleansed from sin. Although the grace of Jesus plays a role in salvation, each Mormon must \\"work out his own salvation\\" through Jesus Christ.Mosiah 3:17 (no other name whereby salvation can come but through Christ); (quoting language of Philippians 2:12); (emphasis on works); (\\"On the faith-works scale, Mormons clearly tilt toward the works side.\\"). Mormons believe that people not baptized during their lifetime may accept salvation in the afterlife through the Mormon practice of baptism for the dead. Although the Book of Mormon rejected the doctrine of universal reconciliation, Smith taught that damnation was a temporary state (for all but the Sons of Perdition) from which the wicked would ultimately escape after they had paid for their sins, to be resurrected into one of the two lesser kingdoms of glory. Mormonism takes an extended view of Christian perfection, (Joseph Smith extended the idea of perfection extended beyond the Protestant orthodoxy). asserting that through the grace of Jesus, Mormons may become perfectly sanctified and thereby literally become gods or achieve a state known as exaltation. (noting that unlike Mormonism, the Methodist view of sanctification \\"was thoroughly trinitarian and retained a distinction between the creature and the creator\\"). To achieve exaltation, Mormons must remain obedient to the teachings of Jesus, receive all the ordinances (or sacraments), which includes baptism, confirmation, receiving the Melchizedek priesthood (for males), the temple endowment, and being sealed to a spouse. Smith also introduced a second anointing ritual, (those who were married eternally were then \\"sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise\\" through the second anointing); ; (citing research of David John Buerger, who assumes that the LDS Church does not consider the second anointing ritual to be a prerequisite for achieving godhood in the afterlife). whose participants, upon continued obedience, were sealed to exaltation, but this was not an essential ordinance. Role of the church Like Catholicism and Orthodoxy, Mormonism assigns considerable authoritative status to church tradition and ecclesiastical leadership.Paul Toscano, Strangers in Paradox: Explorations in Mormon Theology (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1990), Chapter 14 . Mormons emphasize the authority of an institutional church, which in all Mormon denominations derives from the Church of Christ established by Joseph Smith in 1830. Mormons believe this church to be the \\"only true and living church\\". Below Jesus as the head of the church is a single man chosen as the \\"Prophet\\" who holds the position of President of the Church. The Prophet has been compared to the Pope in Catholicism because both, within their respective faiths, are regarded as the leading authority. Mormons also believe in apostolic succession. However, Mormons believe the Catholic line of succession is invalid because of a Great Apostasy that occurred soon after era of the apostles. The line of succession was restored through Joseph Smith when biblical prophets and apostles appeared to him and ordained him through the laying on of hands with lost priesthood authority. Thus, Mormons believe that non-Mormon clergy have no heavenly authority and that sacraments performed by clergy of other faiths are of no effect in the eyes of God. Mormons reject the Protestant doctrine of the \\"priesthood of all believers\\", but they consider all confirmed Mormons to have the \\"Gift of the Holy Ghost\\" (also conveyed by the laying on of hands), which entitles believers to spiritual gifts but to no ecclesiastical authority. =Mormon neo-orthodoxy= Some claim that in the late-20th century, a conservative movement within the LDS Church (called \\"Mormon neo-orthodoxy\\" on the analogy of an earlier Protestant neo-orthodoxy); (noting that Mormonism has become increasingly conservative, denying \\"the traditional liberalism of Mormon theology by favoring a negative description of human nature and the human predicament\\".); (the trend followed Protestant neo-orthodoxy but lacked \\"the vigor and certitude of its Protestant counterpart\\" because Mormons were limited by authoritative statements of Mormon progressives); (Mormon neo- orthodox scholars are \\"less extreme\\" than their Protestant counterparts). emphasized the Book of Mormon over later revelations. and embraced original sin, an absolute, eternal, and unchanging God, a pessimistic assessment of human nature, and a doctrine of salvation by grace rather than by works.; . Despite the book's importance to early Mormonism, early Mormons rarely quoted from the Book of Mormon in their speeches and writings.. Joseph Smith's later teachings and writings focused on the Bible, including his own revision and commentary of the Authorized King James Version. The book was not regularly cited in Mormon conferences until the 1980s. Within the LDS Church, a movement to re-emphasize the Jesus-based elements of Mormonism in the 1980s included a rediscovery of the Book of Mormon.. In 1982, the church subtitled the book \\"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\\", to emphasize that Jesus was a central focus of the book. and that the book is intended to be a complement to the Bible. Although Mormon neo-orthodox scholars say they have faced \\"resistance\\" from Mormon orthodoxy,. some perceive the direction of the movement to be consistent with a broader trend among the LDS hierarchy to present Mormonism in terms more acceptable to mainline Christianity.; . Critics argue that because Mormonism is not based on an authoritative systematic theology,. and much of Mormon scripture was written when Mormonism was \\"essentially trinitarian\\", Mormon leaders and apologists have been able to deny that at least some of 20th-century orthodox Mormonism represents official Mormon doctrine. It is also claimed that LDS Church publications and a few Mormon scholars have increasingly used the language of Nicene Christianity to describe the nature of God.; (noting writings by BYU scholars who describe God as omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent). The existence and implications of the movement continues to be debated. Theologian Richard Mouw asserts that Mormons have downplayed some of its more \\"heretical\\" doctrines in order to obtain more effective dialogue with other Christians. Terryl Givens, a Mormon theologian, has rejected such claims, asserting instead that many Mormon \\"heresies\\" eventually become more accepted by much of Christianity. He consequently contends that \\"Christian consensus is fluid and, in some cases, has lagged behind the Mormon model.\\" Christian views about Mormons In the past, most mainstream Christian denominations rejected Mormonism outright, frequently calling it a cult and characterizing it as \\"non-Christian\\".; . Although mainstream Christian denominations still reject Mormons as being non- Christian, the image of Mormonism has metamorphosed during the 20th century in large part due to an evolution of Mormon theology and partly due to a deliberate effort on the part of the leadership of the LDS Church. According to Jan Shipps, during the 1950s the attitude of mainstream Christians towards Mormonism changed from \\"vilification\\" to \\"veneration\\", with emphasis on positive Mormon traits such as \\"family orientation, clean-cut optimism, honesty and pleasant aggressiveness\\". Richard Abanes attributes an \\"increasing lack of delineation between (Mormonism and mainstream Christianity)\\" to three primary causes: #the willingness of some Mormon leaders to be less than candid about more controversial aspects of LDS history and theology, #a trend among some Mormon scholars to make LDS belief sound more mainstream, and #an evolution of Mormon thought toward doctrinal positions nearer those of evangelicals. Richard Bushman asserts that, for many people, Mormonism \\"conjures up an assortment of contradictory images\\". One set of images suggests that Mormons are \\"happy, uncomplicated, kindly and innocent‚Äîif perhaps naive\\". In contrast to this set of images, Bushman describes a set of associations that focuses on \\"a powerful religious hierarchy controlling the church from the top\\". This perspective views Mormons as \\"secretive, clannish and perhaps dangerous\\", often labeling the movement as a \\"cult rather than a church\\". Mormon apologist Stephen E. Robinson argued that Mormons are labeled heretics \\"for opinions and practices that are freely tolerated in other mainstream denominations\\".. Mormonism has a particularly rocky relationship with American Evangelical Christianity.According to John Pottenger, although both Mormon Christianity and evangelical Christianity claim to be preaching true Christianity, they are nonetheless \\"diametrically opposed in many of their beliefs, theologies and practices\\". . However, according to , Mormonism and American Evangelicalism (and American religion in general) have more in common at a deep level than either of them do with traditional European Christianity. However, the view of Mormonism being non-Christian or a cult is not a uniformly held belief among Evangelicals, especially with those that have personal experience with Mormons in their community. Richard J. Mouw, President of Fuller Theological Seminary, an evangelical school in Pasadena, California, stated in a recent opinion piece for CNN, \\"[t]hose of us who have made the effort to engage Mormons in friendly and sustained give-and-take conversations have come to see them as good citizens whose life of faith often exhibits qualities that are worthy of the Christian label, even as we continue to engage in friendly arguments with them about crucial theological issues.\\" William Saletan has been more blunt about this, stating \\"[w]hy don't we challenge anti-Mormonism? Because it's the prejudice of our age.\\" Joe Scarborough has drawn analogies between the Pharisees in the New Testament and prominent evangelical religious leader Robert Jeffress calling Mormonism a cult. =Non-recognition of Mormon rites= ;LDS perspective Latter Day Saint history comes from the position that other churches were the product of the apostasy, as referenced in the Bible.See references given in the introductory paragraph. Mormons view other Christian churches as teaching some truth, doing good works, and acknowledge their strong faith in Christ.\\"Have the Presbyterians any truth? Yes. Have the Baptists, Methodists, etc., any truth? Yes. They all have a little truth mixed with error. We should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up, or we shall not come out true 'Mormons'.\\" However, Mormons also maintain that all other churches lack the divine authority to perform the ordinances of the gospel because of the Great Apostasy. The LDS Church and most other Latter Day Saint factions do not accept the baptisms of other Christian denominations as valid. ;Traditional perspective The Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant branches of Christianity reject Mormon claims of additional scriptures, and of the prophetic office of Joseph Smith and other Mormon leaders; they disagree with Mormon charges that they have committed apostasy. Doctrines such as the beliefs about the existence of prophets in early American civilizations, which are unique to Mormon theology and not found in the teachings of other Christian churches are also causes of disagreement. Nonetheless, many Christian denominations treat Mormons with respect, while not minimizing the differences in belief.Winning them softly Evangelicals try to reach Mormons with respect - and hard science. John W. Kennedy, posted 2/01/2004 (February 2004, Vol. 48, No. 2) Christianity Today (Accessed:October 7, 2006) In 2001, in the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican's Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith decided not to accept Latter-day Saint baptisms as valid. The Catholic Church generally recognizes baptisms from other Christian faiths in the name of the Trinity, provided the person baptizing intends to do as the Church intends. However, because of differences in Mormon and Catholic beliefs concerning the Trinity, the Catholic Church stated that Mormon baptism was \\"not the baptism that Christ instituted\\". The Catholic Bishop of Salt Lake City, George Hugh Niederauer, stated that this ruling should not be a statement of the LDS relationship with Jesus Christ. The Presbyterian Church USA, the largest Presbyterian body in the United States, publishes a brochure describing the LDS Church as follows: :The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, like the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), declares allegiance to Jesus. Latter-day Saints and Presbyterians share use of the Bible as scripture, and members of both churches use common theological terms. Nevertheless, Mormonism is a new and emerging religious tradition distinct from the historic apostolic tradition of the Christian Church, of which Presbyterians are a part. ... It is the practice of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) to receive on profession of faith those coming directly from a Mormon background and to administer baptism. ... Presbyterian relationships with Latter-day Saints have changed throughout the twentieth century. By God's grace they may change further. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran body in the US, notes that Lutherans have been among those Christians who do not re-baptize other baptized Christians; however, it publishes the following statement on the recognition of Mormon baptisms: :Although Mormons may use water‚Äîand lots of it‚Äîand while they may say \\"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\\", their teaching about the nature of God is substantially different from that of orthodox, creedal Christianity. Because the Mormon understanding of the Word of God is not the same as the Christian understanding, it is correct to say that Christian Baptism has not taken place. In its 2000 General Conference, the United Methodist Church decided not to recognize Latter-day Saint baptisms, stating: :The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, by self-definition, does not fit within the bounds of the historic, apostolic tradition of Christian faith. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the LDS Church itself, while calling itself Christian, explicitly professes a distinction and separateness from the ecumenical community and is intentional about clarifying significant differences in doctrine. As United Methodists we agree with their assessment that the LDS Church is not a part of the historic, apostolic tradition of the Christian faith. The Episcopal Church (USA), part of the 80-million-member Anglican Communion, does not have an official position on the validity of Mormon baptism; however, most traditional clergy would not accept Mormon baptism and require the baptism of Mormons entering into the Episcopal Church. Retired bishop Carolyn Tanner Irish of the Episcopal Diocese of Utah was baptized into the LDS Church at the age of 8, her baptism was deemed valid upon her entering into the Episcopal Church in 1977, where she was confirmed by bishop of Washington, Rev. John T. Walker. As with the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church does not recognize Mormons as historic Apostolic Christians, but rather as a new and unique religious movement that is an offshoot of Christianity. =Proselytizing of Mormons by evangelical Christians= Many other Christian churches also seek to teach or convert Mormons when the opportunity arises. Traditional Christian leaders often encourage their followers to follow the admonition of Paul and witness to others using gentleness and respect. Like their Mormon counterparts, those from the traditional Christian religions assert that these proselytizing efforts arise out of love and genuine concern for others and not a desire to cause contention. Consequently, though the feelings may be strong, there is often a feeling of mutual appreciation and respect that accompanies missionary efforts on both sides (though this is not always the case). Some traditional Christian denominations have ministries focused on Mormons, just as they also have ministries toward Jews, Native Americans, or other demographic groups.SeeSeeSee For example, the 1998 convention of the Southern Baptist Convention held in Salt Lake City had the stated aim to \\"bring Christianity to the Mormons\\". There are also many independent ministries and organizations focused on Mormons.Examples of such ministries include Utah Lighthouse Ministries,Mormonism Research Ministries, Ministries, Berean Christian Ministries,Life After Ministries =Polls and attitudes= A 2007 Pew Poll showed that 31% of the general public in the United States believe that Mormons are not Christians.; 2007 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center. See, for example, http://www.religionnewsblog.com/19478/religion-poll-2 Similar polls have concluded that over two-thirds of the general public view Mormons as members of the larger Christian community, including many independent evangelical ministries and prominent evangelical leaders. However, in an October 2010 poll conducted by LifeWay Research, three out of four American Protestant pastors did not believe that Mormons were Christians. Mormon engagement with broader Christianity In the 1960s, the LDS Church formed the Church Information Service with the goal of being ready to respond to media inquiries and generate positive media coverage. The organization kept a photo file to provide photos to the media for such events as temple dedications. It also would work to get stories covering Family Home Evening, the church's welfare plan and the church's youth activities in various publications.Richard O. Cowan. The Church in the 20th Century (Bookcraft: Salt Lake City, 1985) p. 289 As part of the church's efforts to re-position its image as that of a mainstream religion, the church began to moderate its earlier anti-Catholic rhetoric. In Bruce R. McConkie's 1958 edition of Mormon Doctrine, he had stated his opinion that the Catholic Church was part of \\"the church of the devil\\" and \\"the great and abominable church\\" because it was among organizations that misled people away from following God's laws. In his 1966 edition of the same book, the specific reference to the Catholic Church was removed.; . In 1973, the LDS Church recast its missionary lessons, making them more family-friendly and focused on building on common Christian ideals. The new lessons, named \\"A Uniform System for Teaching Families\\", de-emphasized the Great Apostasy, which previously held a prominent position just after the story of the First Vision. After a further revision in the early 1980s, the lessons dealt with the apostasy even less conspicuously by moving its discussion from the first lesson to later lessons. The lessons also became more family-friendly, including a flip chart with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children. In 1995, the church announced a new logo design that emphasized the words \\"JESUS CHRIST\\" in large capital letters. According to Bruce L. Olsen, director of public affairs for the church, \\"The logo re-emphasizes the official name of the church and the central position of the Savior in its theology. It stresses our allegiance to the Lord, Jesus Christ.\\". In 2001, the church sent out a press release encouraging reporters to use the full name of the church at the beginning of news articles, with following references to the \\"Church of Jesus Christ\\". The release discouraged the use of the term \\"Mormon Church\\".\\"Style Guide ‚Äì The Name of the Church\\", mormonnewsroom.org, accessed 6 April 2016. =Downplaying of differences= Riess and Tickle assert that, starting in the late twentieth century, Mormons have focused their attention on Jesus Christ more than at any other time since the inception of their faith. Some critics of the LDS Church have accused church leaders of attempting to disingenuously portray the church as \\"just another Christian denomination\\" when, in fact, there are significant differences. Riess and Tickle argue that these critics are failing to grasp that this recent emphasis on Jesus Christ is part of a genuine theological evolution that concurrently involves a renewed interest in the Book of Mormon. Ross Anderson asserts that, \\"(i)n public, LDS spokesmen downplay their Church's distinctive doctrines.\\" Patricia Limerick suggests that future historians may conclude that, in the last four decades of the 20th, the general authorities of the LDS Church \\"undertook to standardize Mormon thought and practice\\". According to Limerick, this campaign of standardization has led to a retreat from the distinctive elements of Mormonism and an accentuation of the church's similarity to conventional Christianity. According to Claudia Bushman, \\"[t]he renewed emphasis on scripture study, especially the Book of Mormon, led the Church away from speculative theology. The freewheeling General Conference addresses of earlier years, elaborating unique LDS doctrines, were gradually replaced with a basic Christian message downplaying denominational differences.\\" Recent church presidents have tended to downplay those doctrines that served to distinguish Mormonism from mainline churches. Richard Abanes asserts that President Gordon B. Hinckley \\"on numerous occasions demonstrated his willingness to seriously downplay any issues that might be construed as controversial\\". In 2001, Hinckley stated that message of the LDS Church was \\"Christ-centered. [Christ is] our leader. He's our head. His name is the name of our church.\\" When speaking about other faiths, modern LDS leaders have adopted a policy of avoiding the use of critical and judgmental language in official church publications, and encouraged members of the church to be respectful of the beliefs of others as they witness in their personal lives.M. Russell Ballard, \\"Sharing the Gospel Using the Internet\\", Liahona, June 2008. When speaking about other faiths, church magazines are often complimentary and focus on providing factual information rather than on sensationalizing or otherwise seeking to undermine the creeds and practices of others.See these articles (published in the church magazines) on various other faiths: Islam, Catholicism (see also these remarks by Hinckley about the passing of Pope John Paul II), The Church of England. Several presidents of the LDS Church over the years have emphasized the need for Mormons to recognize the good contributions those of other faiths make to the world.\\"We recognize the good in all churches. We recognize the value of religion generally. We say to everyone: live the teachings which you have received from your church. We invite you to come and learn from us, to see if we can add to those teachings and enhance your life and your understanding of things sacred and divine. Now we work with people of other faiths on common causes, many of them across the world. We recognize theological differences. We believe that we can disagree theologically without being disagreeable, and we hope to do so. We have been rather careful about surrendering in any way our doctrinal standards, anything of that kind as part of an ecumenical effort, but we certainly have worked with people, and do work with people, and want to work with other groups in tackling common social problems, things of that kind which are so much in need of attention these days throughout the world\\" (Gordon B. Hinckley, interview with Lawrence Spicer, London News Service, 28 August 1995). =Cooperation with other Christian denominations= Ron Rhodes asserts that, \\"The Mormon church has in recent years sought to downplay its exclusivism as the 'restored' church. Indeed, the Mormon church has increasingly become involved with the Interfaith movement, joining with various Christian denominations in various charities.\\" Traditional Christian denominations and the LDS Church share work in providing welfare or humanitarian aid. In recent years, the LDS Church has opened its broadcasting facilities (Bonneville International) to other Christian groups, and has participated in the VISN Religious Interfaith Cable Television Network. =Dialogue with other Christian denominations= There have been independent activities among individuals from both traditions who attempt to discuss openly about issues of faith.See Craig L. Blomberg and Stephen E. Robinson, How Wide the Divide?: A Mormon & an Evangelical in Conversation Inter-Varsity Press, March 1997 and In November 2004, Fuller Theological Seminary President Richard Mouw, and Ravi Zacharias, a well known Christian philosophical apologist, addressed a congregation of Mormons and Evangelicals gathered in the Salt Lake Tabernacle for an event sponsored by Standing Together Ministries that was well received despite the differences they acknowledged between Mormonism and the Christian Evangelical perspectives. =Proselytization of other Christian denominations= Mormons proselytize to all people, including members of other Christian churches, holding to the belief that God told Joseph Smith \\"that those professors [of religion] were all corrupt; that: 'they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.'\\"Joseph Smith, History of the Church, vol. 1, ch. 1. \\"Corrupt\\" here is taken to refer to their beliefs rather than personal morality. See \\"Section 33: Declare My Gospel\\", Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2002) p. 68. Because ministering to those of other Christian faiths can be a sensitive task when feelings on both sides are strong, leaders of the LDS Church have counseled members to be sensitive, to exercise caution, and to avoid contentions in their preaching. Despite the criticisms of other creeds, a tone of respect has consistently been encouraged by Mormon leaders. For example, Wilford Woodruff, an early president of the church and a contemporary of Joseph Smith taught: > When you go into a neighborhood to preach the Gospel, never attempt to tear > down a man's house, so to speak, before you build him a better one; never, > in fact, attack any one's religion, wherever you go. Be willing to let every > man enjoy his own religion. It is his right to do that. If he does not > accept your testimony with regard to the Gospel of Christ, that is his > affair, and not yours. Do not spend your time in pulling down other sects > and parties. We haven't time to do that. It is never right to do that.The > Contributor, August 1895, pp. 636‚Äì37. While the LDS Church has been clear about its disagreements with many of the theologies and practices of other religions and seeks actively to convert all people to its own teachings, it has also always adopted a policy of toleration for others and defended the rights of all people to worship God freely. Article 11 of the church's Articles of Faith written by Joseph Smith states, \\"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.\\" Smith spoke often of the need for Mormons to be civil and courteous in their treatment of others, particularly those who were not of their faith, and to be willing to defend the right of anyone to religious freedom. He said: > If we would secure and cultivate the love of others, we must love others, > even our enemies as well as friends ... I possess the principle of love. All > I can offer the world is a good heart and a good hand. The Saints can > testify whether I am willing to lay down my life for my brethren. If it has > been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a \\"Mormon\\", I am bold > to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in defending the > rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any other > denomination. ... It is a love of liberty which inspires my soul.History of > the Church, 5:498. Because Mormon missionaries proselytize to all, including other Christians, some Christian organizations have published tracts, brochures and books designed to counter these missionary efforts.\\"The Kingdom of the Cults\\" Walter Martin (Revised 2003) Bethany House Publishers, Grand Rapids Michigan\\"Mormonism 101\\" Bill McKeever & Eric Johnson -Grand Rapids: Baker Publishing Group, 2000\\"Mormonism Unmasked\\" Phillip Roberts -Nashville: Broadman & Holman 1998 Conciliar Press, a department of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, has published a brochure designed to inform Orthodox Christians of the proselytizing efforts of what it describes as \\"cultists\\" (Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses). In 2006, the Catholic bishops in Slovakia urged all Catholics in the country not to sign a petition allowing the LDS Church to be legally recognized in that country.

The film was the last film Tony Scott directed before his death. The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 12, 2010. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $167 million against a production budget between $85‚Äì100 million. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Sound Editing at the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to Inception.  Plot  While yard hostlers are moving an Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad (AWVR) train, pulled by lead locomotive #777 at a trainyard in northern Pennsylvania, Dewey, the engineer of the mixed-freight train, realizes that a switch is not correctly aligned and tries to realign it by leaving the cabin of the moving locomotive after setting the throttle to idle, but he trips and falls, leaving the locomotive unattended going down the main line. Meanwhile the throttle pops out of idle. Believing the train is coasting, yardmaster Connie Hooper orders Dewey, Gilleece, and welder Ned Oldham to drive and catch up to the train, but when Oldham deduces that the train has already passed where it was expected to be, they realize it is running on full power. Connie alerts Oscar Galvin, VP of Train Operations, and instructs local and state police to block all level crossings. Federal Railroad Administration inspector Scott Werner, while visiting Hooper's yard, warns that eight of the 39 cars contain highly toxic and flammable molten phenol, which would cause a major disaster if the train should derail in a populated area. News of the runaway soon draws ongoing media coverage. Connie suggests they purposely derail the train while it passes through unpopulated farmland. Galvin dismisses her opinion, believing he can save the company money by lashing the train behind two locomotives helmed by engineer Judd Stewart, slowing it down enough for employee and former U.S. Marine Ryan Scott to descend via helicopter to the control cab of 777. However, Scott is knocked unconscious during the attempt, and when Stewart attempts to divert 777 to a siding, he is unable to slow it down and is killed when his train derails. Realizing that 777 will derail on the Stanton Curve, a tight, elevated portion of track in heavily populated Stanton, plans are finally made to purposely derail the train outside the smaller town of Arklow. Veteran AWVR engineer Frank Barnes and conductor Will Colson, a new hire under a restraining order with his estranged wife Darcy, are pulling several cars with locomotive #1206 out of Stanton. As their too- long train forced them to bypass their first siding, they narrowly manage to pull into a \\"RIP track\\" before 777 races by, smashing through their last box car. Frank observes that 777's rear car has an open coupler and proposes that they travel in reverse and catch up to the 777 in an attempt to couple their engine to the runaway and then use their own brakes to slow down 777 before it reaches the Stanton curve. Will uncouples 1206 from their own cars, while Frank reports his plan to Connie and Galvin, warning that Galvin's derailing idea will not work given 777's momentum. Galvin threatens to fire Frank, who informs Galvin that AWVR has already given Frank a forced, half-benefits, early-retirement notice. Galvin threatens to fire Will as well, but both Frank and Will ignore him and pursue 777. As 777 approaches the portable derail devices, police first attempt to engage the engine's fuel-shutoff button by shooting at it, but are unsuccessful. As Frank predicted, the train barrels through the derailers unhindered. Knowing that Frank's plan is their only remaining chance at preventing a cataclysmic disaster, Connie and Werner fully support him and take over control of the situation from Galvin. Meanwhile, Darcy wakes up and learns about 777 and Will's involvement in the chase. Similarly, Frank's daughters learn at work of their father's involvement. Frank and Will catch up to 777 and attempt to engage the coupler, blowing the seal on the car, spraying grain onto 1206. When the locking pin will not engage, Will kicks it into place, but gets injured in the process. Will hobbles back to 1206's cab, and Frank attempts to slow 777 by powering 1206 in the opposite direction, but 777's momentum proves to be too powerful. Will stays in the cab to work the dynamic brakes and throttle while Frank dangerously works his way across the top of 777's cars, manually engaging the brakes on each car. Eventually, 1206‚Äôs brakes fail and the train starts gaining speed again. Using coordinated braking techniques, they manage to reduce speed enough to just barely clear the Stanton Curve with the train tipping but righting itself. As 777 picks up speed, Frank finds his path blocked to 777's cab. Ned arrives in his truck with a police escort and drives on a road parallel to the tracks. Will jumps onto the bed of Ned's truck, and Ned drives him to the front of 777, where Will leaps onto the locomotive and engages the brakes, finally allowing them to bring the runaway train to a stop. Frank, Will, and Ned are heralded as heroes. Via captions, we learn that Frank gets promoted and later retires with full benefits. Will reunites with his son and Darcy (who is currently expecting their second child) and recovers from his injuries. Connie is promoted to Galvin's VP position, and Dewey, who is held responsible for causing the fiasco, loses his job and goes on to work at a fast-food restaurant. Locomotives The locomotives used in the movie were borrowed from two railroads. The 2 AWVR locomotives, 777 and 767, were GE AC4400CW's borrowed from the Canadian Pacific Railway. 777 was played by CP 9782 and 9777. 767 was played by CP 9782 (during 777's 9777) and 9751. The other locomotives, such as the 1206 and the EMD SD40-2's, were borrowed from Wheeling and Lake Erie. 1206 was played by W&LE; 6353 and 6354. 7375 was W&LE; 6352, also playing as AWVR 5624. Lastly, 7346 was W&LE; 6351\\\\. W&LE; 6352 also played as AWVR 5607 (Brewster yard) and AWVR 5580.

In August 2004, Mark Bomback was hired by 20th Century Fox to write the screenplay Runaway Train. Robert Schwentke signed on to direct Runaway Train in August 2005, with plans to begin shooting in early 2006. In June 2007, Martin Campbell was in negotiations to replace Schwentke as director of the film, now titled Unstoppable. Campbell was attached until March 2009, when Tony Scott came on board as director. In April, both Denzel Washington and Chris Pine were attached to the project. The original budget had been trimmed from $107 million to $100 million, but Fox wanted to reduce it to the low $90 million range, asking Scott to cut his salary from $9 million to $6 million and wanting Washington to shave $4 million off his $20 million fee. Washington declined and, although attached since April, formally withdrew from the project in July, citing lost patience with the film's lack of a start date. Fox made a modified offer as enticement, and he returned to the project two weeks later. Production was headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where the fictional railroad depicted in the movie, the \\"Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad,\\" is headquartered. Filming took place in a broad area around there including the Ohio cities of Martins Ferry, Bellaire, Mingo Junction, Steubenville and Brewster, and in the Pennsylvania cities of Pittsburgh, Emporium, Milesburg, Tyrone, Julian, Unionville, Port Matilda, Bradford, Monaca, Eldred, Turtlepoint, Port Allegany and Carnegie, and also in Portville and Olean, New York.Hollywood comes to Olean Friday. WIVB.com. Retrieved November 13, 2010. The film is the most expensive ever to be shot in Western Pennsylvania. The Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad's Buffalo Line was used for two months during daylight, while the railroad ran its regular freight service at night. The real-life bridge and elevated curve in the climactic scene is the B & O Railroad Viaduct between Bellaire, Ohio and Benwood, West Virginia. A major oversight in the film was the size of \\"Stanton, Pennsylvania\\". Listed as having 752,000 people, this would have made Stanton more than twice the size of Pittsburgh in 2010, whereas the city which was set as Stanton, Bellaire, Ohio, was considerably smaller, having just over 4,000 residents. A two-day filming session took place at the Hooters restaurant in Wilkins Township, a Pittsburgh suburb, featuring 10 Hooters girls from across the United States. Other interior scenes were shot at 31st Street Studios (then the Mogul Media Studios) on 31st Street in Pittsburgh. Principal photography began on August 31, 2009, for a release on November 12, 2010. The video for the song \\"Beyond Tension\\" by Texas based, electronic musician Jon Dishongh, can be seen playing on two background televisions across multiple scenes. This occurred by accident due to a cast member watching various music videos during breaks, while on set. Filming was delayed for one day when part of the train accidentally derailed on November 21, 2009. CP #9777, a GE AC4400CW locomotive was used to film early scenes. Photographed in 2010 after the locomotive was repainted. The locomotives used on the runaway train, 777 and trailing unit 767, were played by GE AC4400CWs leased from the Canadian Pacific Railway. CP #9777 and #9758 played 777 and 767 in early scenes, and CP #9782 and #9751 were given a damaged look for later scenes. These four locomotives were repainted by Canadian Pacific in standard colors following the filming, but the painted pilot warning stripes from the AWVR livery were left untouched and remained visible on the locomotives. The plow on 9777 appears to have been repainted black as of 2013. . Most of the other locomotives seen in the film, including chase locomotive #1206, and the locomotive consist used in an attempt to stop the train, #7375 and #7346, were played by EMD SD40-2s leased from the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. #1206 was played by three different SD40-2s: W&LE; #6353 and #6354, and a third unit that was bought from scrap and modified for cab shots. Judd Stewart's locomotive consist #7375 and #7346 were played by W&LE; #6352 and #6351, which also played two locomotive \\"extras\\" (#5624 and #5580), wearing the same grey livery with different running numbers.http://www.myrailfan.com/News/1033/ The excursion train locomotive (#2002) was played by a Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad Paducah-built EMD GP11 rebuilt from an EMD GP9. Passenger coaches carrying schoolchildren were provided by the Orrville Railroad Heritage Society. Inspiration Unstoppable was inspired by the 2001 CSX 8888 incident, in which a runaway train ultimately traveled through northwest Ohio. Led by CSX Transportation SD40-2 #8888, the train left the Walbridge, Ohio, rail yard with no one at the controls, after the hostler got out of the slow-moving train to correct a misaligned switch, mistakenly believing he had properly set the train's dynamic braking system, much as his counterpart (Dewey) in the film mistakenly believed he had properly set the locomotive's throttle (in the CSX incident, the locomotive had an older-style throttle stand where the same lever controlled both the throttle and the dynamic brakes; in fact, putting on \\"full throttle\\" and \\"full brakes\\" both involved advancing the same lever to the highest position after switching to a different operating mode. Thus if the engineer failed to properly switch modes, it was easy to accidentally apply full throttle instead of full brake, or vice versa.) Two of the train's tank cars contained thousands of gallons of molten phenol, a toxic ingredient of paints and dyes harmful when it is inhaled, ingested, or brought into contact with the skin. Attempts to derail it using a portable derailer failed, and police were unable to shoot out the fuel release valve, instead hitting the fuel cap. For two hours, the train traveled at speeds up to until the crew of a second train coupled onto the runaway and slowly applied its brakes. Once the runaway was slowed down to , CSX trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train and climbed aboard, shutting down the locomotive. The train was stopped just southeast of Kenton, Ohio. No one was seriously injured in the incident. When the film was released, the Toledo Blade compared the events of the film to the real-life incident. \\"It's predictably exaggerated and dramatized to make it more entertaining,\\" wrote David Patch, \\"but close enough to the real thing to support the 'Inspired by True Events' announcement that flashes across the screen at its start.\\" He notes that the dead man switch would probably have worked in real life despite the unconnected brake hoses, unless the locomotive, or independent brakes, were already applied. As explained in the movie, the dead man's switch failed because the only available brakes were the independent brakes, which were quickly worn through, similar to CSX 8888. The film exaggerates the possible damage the phenol could have caused in a fire, and he found it incredible that the fictional AWVR freely disseminated information such as employees' names and images and the cause of the runaway to the media. In the real instance, he writes, the cause of the runaway was not disclosed until months later when the National Transportation Safety Board released its report, and CSX never made public the name of the engineer whose error let the train slip, nor what disciplinary action was taken.

Reay. It is a compilation of scarce, non-canonical revelations of leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Contents The book contains 185 revelations, visions, temple dedications, etc..., some of which are very short or intended for a specific individual rather than general readers. The library of the church-owned Brigham Young University (BYU) identifies the book as containing \\"Private revelations\\". Each revelation is presented in its own enumerated \\"selection\\" which is further divided into numbered verses. Although these revelations are excluded from the accepted canon of the LDS Church, they are presented in a very similar format to the church's canonical Doctrine and Covenants (D&C;), which also contains revelations of LDS Church leaders divided into \\"sections\\" and verses.Since the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1835, each revelation divided into its own enumerated \\"section\\", although the earlier Book of Commandments listed each revelation as a \\"chapter\\". In 1876 Orson Pratt first divided the D&C; sections into verses. The book billed itself as belonging \\"alongside the four Standard Works\\" because it contained nearly all the revelations and declarations of the church's Apostles and Prophets that weren't already included in the D&C.; The various revelations in the book include: * Vision of the Savior at the School of the Prophets * A Revelation on Copyrights for Church Publications * A Revelation Reproving the Brethren for Not Honoring Official Titles * Remarks to the Twelve on the Endowment * Revelation on Eternal Progress of Mankind Given to Lorenzo Snow * Revelation on the Council of Fifty Giving Full Name * Revelation on the Proper Names of God by Elder Orson Pratt * Revelation on the Design of Temples by President Brigham Young * Vision of the Savior in Gethsemane Given to Orson F. Whitney * Revelation on the Holy Priesthood * Visitations of Joseph the Prophet to President Wilford Woodruff * Vision of Savior in Salt Lake Temple Given to Melvin J. Ballard * Status of Children in the Resurrection by Joseph F. Smith * Power of the Holy Priesthood by President Joseph Fielding Smith * Vision of the Lamanites Given to President Spencer W. Kimball Also included are revelations to David O. McKay and others, and famous speeches from such figures as Boyd K. Packer and Bruce R. McConkie. In addition, the book contained dedication prayers for all the church's Temples at that time, as well as for uncompleted sites, such as Independence, Far West, and Adam-Ondi-Ahman. Among the twelve appendices is a bibliography on the D&C; and a list of the Priesthood Courses of Study. Scarcity Shortly after publication in 1985, Selected Manifestations was recalled from retailer bookshelves, reportedly over copyright concerns with the LDS Church, and due to the fact that they were arranged like scriptures, i.e. the Doctrine and Covenants, but in \\"Selections\\" rather than \\"Sections.\\" Another controversial feature was that the book was dedicated to our \\"Mother in Heaven.\\" Some allege the church tried to stop its publication and ordered the authors, who were members of the church in Oakland, California, to stop selling it. Copies of the book are rare (it is believed that only about 200 copies exist) and it is listed in Bret Eborn's \\"Guide to Mormon Books\\" and sells for $400 to $800 on the rare book market.For example, in 2013, Amazon was offering two copies of the book at $900 apiece.

Early life The son of Jos√©phine Martin and Norbert Th√©riault, a former provincial cabinet minister and Canadian Senator, Camille Th√©riault was born in Baie-Sainte-Anne, New Brunswick, and graduated from √âcole R√©gionale de Baie Sainte-Anne. He then obtained a bachelor of social science degree with a major in political science from the Universit√© de Moncton. Political career Th√©riault was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1987 provincial election that saw the Liberal Party, of which he was a member, win every seat in the province. Due to the unusual situation of leading a government with no parliamentary opposition, Premier Frank McKenna named backbench members of his caucus to form a shadow cabinet. Th√©riault was the leader of this \\"unofficial opposition\\", which met daily when the house was in session to prepare questions of Question Period of which the ministers would be given no notice. Following the 1991 election, some balance was restored to the legislature with the opposition parties holding 12 of 58 seats and the \\"unofficial opposition\\" was not continued. Th√©riault was named to cabinet as Minister of Fisheries. In 1994, he was appointed Minister of Advanced Education and Labour Th√©riault was re-elected in 1995 and became Minister of Economic Development‚Äîa key role in the McKenna government. When McKenna announced his resignation in 1997, Th√©riault, who was long expected to be the favourite in the race to succeed McKenna as Liberal leader, ceded the early position of front-runner to charismatic Finance Minister Edmond Blanchard. However, Blanchard soon dropped out of the race. Th√©riault left cabinet to campaign for the leadership of the Liberals, as did his two opponents, Education Minister Bernard Richard and junior cabinet minister Greg Byrne. Byrne, a relative unknown before the race, caught momentum during the race, though Th√©riault managed to win on the first ballot. As leader of the governing Liberals, he soon became premier. He rejigged the cabinet upon being sworn-in, changing some departments and decreasing its overall size. He pledged to bring in many new programs, focussing on social services, in contrast to the fiscal conservatism of McKenna, but felt he should win a mandate of his own before instituting any major changes. The opposition Progressive Conservatives had themselves just chosen a leader, the young Bernard Lord, an unknown with no political experience. Th√©riault waited for Lord to contest a seat for the legislature and get some experience in the House before calling a vote. In doing so, Th√©riault gave up one of the key advantages of the incumbency, letting it be widely known months in advance that the election would be held in June 1999. Th√©riault and his Liberals seemed to have underestimated Lord's Conservatives over whom they enjoyed a double-digit lead in early opinion polls. In the early days of the campaign, Lord reversed his earlier position, shared with the government, supporting highway tolls on the new divided route from Fredericton to Moncton. Lord used his new pledge to remove the tolls as the centrepiece of his campaign, he effectively used the issue as the prime example for the arrogance of the government and also incorporated his pledge into his \\"200 Days of Change\\" promise‚Äî20 key commitments Lord said he would implement within his first 200 days in office. Th√©riault largely ignored Lord's surging campaign as he felt the Liberals would easily cruise to victory‚Äîa feeling mirrored in polls right up until the last week. On June 7, election, the Tories won their largest victory ever, taking 44 of 55 seats. Th√©riault's concession speech was very gracious and was seen as probably his best of the campaign. He remarked that \\"the people have spoken, and the people are never wrong.\\" In that election, the Liberals were reduced from 45 seats to just 10. Th√©riault stayed on as leader of the opposition and was seen as effective in the role. Despite this, the Liberals lost two by-elections in early 2001 that had been vacated by former Liberal cabinet ministers moving to federal politics. In March of that year, Th√©riault resigned his seat and as leader of the Liberals. Following his resignation as party leader, then-Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien appointed him to the Transportation Safety Board, and within the year he was named its chairman. In 2004, he was named president of the Mouvement des caisses populaires acadiennes (now UNI Financial Cooperation). Th√©riault mused briefly about running in the 2004 federal election but opted not to.

Physicians and other scientists are paid to attach their names to the manuscripts as though they had authored them. The named authors may have had little or no involvement in the research or writing process. Definitions and rules The American Medical Writers Association speaks to the topic as follows: : > \\"Ghost authoring\\" refers to making substantial contributions without being > identified as an author. \\"Guest authoring\\" refers to being named as an > author without having made substantial contributions. \\"Ghostwriting\\" refers > to assisting in presenting the author's work without being acknowledged. The > term \\"ghostwriting\\" is often used to encompass all three of these practices. The rules for authorship and contribution of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE, informally known as \\"the Vancouver Group\\" from the locale of the group's first meeting, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) are a single, universally-respected set of guidelines for describing authorship of and contribution to professional medical publications. The document \\"International Committee of Medical Journal Editors: Defining the Role of Authors and Contributors\\" is considered the definitive statement of ethical requirements for how authorship in medical journal articles (the prime forum for medical professional publication) and the degree to which a given writer is deemed to have contributed to the content of a medical journal article are determined. Compliance with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals is voluntary. A list of medical journals which have stated that they follow the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals is maintained by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. How closely individual medical journals and authors of medical journal articles comply with ICMJE guidelines is a largely self-policed matter. The ICMJE document \\"Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Publishing and Editorial Issues Related to Publication in Biomedical Journals: Corrections, Retractions and \\"Expressions of Concern\\" is the section of the ICMJE Uniform Requirements laying out guidelines for how potential or actual scientific error and scientific fraud ought to be dealt with. It refers readers to the relevant guidelines from the Committee for Publication Ethics (COPE) \\\\- specifically COPE's flowcharts outlining a systematic approach toward scientific error and possible fraud.http://publicationethics.org/files/All%20Flowcharts%20English%2017%20July%202012.pdf Criticism Medical ghostwriting has been criticized by a variety of professional organizations representing the drug industry, publishers, and medical societies, and it may violate American laws prohibiting off-label promotion by drug manufacturers as well as anti-kickback provisions within the statutes governing Medicare. Recently, it has attracted scrutiny from the lay press lawmakersHouse of Commons Health Committee (2005) The influence of the pharmaceutical industry.

Scandals involving prominent physicians researchers have been reported at over a dozen universities in the United States, however, there have been no reports of any professors being disciplined. Professor Trudo Lemmens of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law argues that ghostwritten papers help protect companies when they are sued in court.Thacker, Paul, \\"How Scientific Literature Has Become Part of Big Pharma's Marketing Machine and How Being Nice Hurts Canada: 5 Questions with Ghostwriting Expert Trudo Lemmens\\", Project On Government Oversight, Jun 22, 2011 Perhaps the most pernicious practice in ghostwriting involves thanking writers for providing ‚Äúeditorial assistance‚Äù in the acknowledgments section of the paper instead of the authorship byline, which essentially changes the rule of authorship attribution so that ghostwriting is acceptable. Several groups in medicine including the European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) sanction this practice. While the average reader likely interprets ‚Äúeditorial assistance‚Äù as help with grammar or improvements to the overall readability of the article, in reality, such ‚Äúassistants‚Äù make major contributions to papers, and would commonsensically be considered co-authors. Tellingly, many medical writers are ‚Äúeditorial assistants‚Äù on some scientific papers, but co-authors on others. It would seem obvious that someone employed as a ‚Äúmedical writer‚Äù would be an author, but current dialogue on ghostwriting ignores such common- sense interpretations. Listing ghost authors as editorial assistants allows pharmaceutical companies to publish articles with conflicts-of interest that are not transparently reported. Editorial assistants are not mentioned in the abstract, are not indexed in publication databases, are not mentioned in subsequent citations, and are never mentioned in news media accounts of the article. In other words, the fact that a pharmaceutical company directly co- authored the paper is concealed from view. That this is seen as acceptable in an era of increased disclosure of conflicts-of-interest is puzzling. While several groups in medicine including the European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) sanction the practice of thanking medical writers for providing ‚Äúeditorial assistance‚Äù in the acknowledgments section of the paper instead of listing them on the authorship byline, the problem with simply thanking ghostwriters in the acknowledgements section is clearly illustrated by Study 329, probably the most notorious ghostwritten paper in the medical literature. The study examined the use of Paxil in adolescents and concluded, ‚ÄúParoxetine is generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents.‚Äù Several years after the paper was published, court proceedings revealed internal company documents admitting that the study found that Paxil was not any better than placebo on the pre-registered outcome measures, and that the company was concerned about how to manage the negative findings. According to the revised ICMJE Guidelines, Professional medical writers who write papers are not exempt from being listed as authors of the paper Leo, J., and Lacasse, J.R.

A 2009 New York Times article estimated that 11% of New England Journal of Medicine articles, 8% of JAMA, Lancet and PLoS Medicine articles, 5% of Annals of Internal Medicine articles and 2% of Nature Medicine were ghost written. Between 1998 and 2005 Wyeth had 26 papers promoting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) published in scientific journals. Previously secret internal Wyeth documents providing evidence of this are viewable on the Drug Industry Document Archive. It also appears to have occurred in 75% of industry funded trials between 1994 - 1995 approved by the Scientific Ethical Committees for Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. Of the articles published from 1998 to 2000 regarding sertraline, between 18% and 40% were ghost written by Pfizer. A questionnaire using comparable methods in 2005 and 2008 with a 14-28% response rate found a decrease in number of people who reported ghostwriting among professional medical writers. Most pharmaceutical companies have in-house publication managers who may either manage the writing of publications on the company's drugs by a team of in-house medical writers or contract them out to medical communication companies or freelance medical writers. Reprints of the articles can be distributed to doctors in their offices or at medical meetings by drug company representatives in lieu of product brochures. This practice might be illegal if it effectively constitutes advertising or advocating use of the drug for non-approved indications or dosages. Payments to medical ghostwriters may be augmented with consulting contracts, paid trips to teach continuing medical education courses, or grants. The academics or doctors are known as \\"KOLs\\" (\\"Key Opinion Leaders\\") or \\"TLs\\" (\\"Thought Leaders\\").https://business-and-science.de/ghostwriter/werden/ Senate investigation On June 24, 2010, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Ranking Member of the United States Senate Committee on Finance issued a report on medical ghost writing. The report said, \\"The Committee was provided with documents from recent lawsuits involving Wyeth‚Äôs hormone therapy products. The documents showed that Wyeth hired a medical communications and education company, DesignWrite Inc. (DesignWrite), to draft review articles regarding the breast cancer risk of hormone therapy products and then invited academic researchers to sign on as the primary authors.\\" See also *Study 329 References Category:Ghostwriting Category:Medical publishing Category:Ethically disputed educational practices Category:Communication of falsehoods Category:Misconduct Category:Social problems in medicine Category:Clinical research ethics ","title":"Medical ghostwriter"},{"id":"23883907","text":"Shivram Baburao Bhoje (born 9 April 1942) is a distinguished Indian nuclear scientist who worked in the field of fast-breeder nuclear reactor technology for forty years in the design, construction, operation, and research and development. Indian government has honoured him with Padma Shri in 2003, the fourth highest civilian award in India, for his distinguished service to science and engineering fields. Biography Bhoje was born on 9 April 1942 in Kasaba Sangaon, a small village in Kolhapur district which falls under Kagal Taluka jurisdiction. He completed his schooling in Dadasaheb Magadum high school, Kasaba Sangaon. He was famous for his knowledge in mathematics and science in his school. After completing schooling, he moved to Rajaram College Kolhapur to complete his junior college education. He completed his Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1965 from College of Engineering Pune, COEP, University of Pune. Professional Bhoje completed one year training in Nuclear Science and Engineering at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre Training School and joined as a Scientific Officer at BARC, Trombay. He started working in the Fast Reactor Section for design of an experimental reactor. He was on a one-year deputation to the Centre d'Etudes Nucleare Cadarache, France, as a member of the design team of the 13-mW fast- breeder test reactor (FBTR) in 1969‚Äì70. After returning to India in 1971, he worked at Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam. Initially he was in-charge of design of 40 MW Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) reactor assembly. On completion of the design, he was responsible for the construction of FBTR. He redesigned the reactor core with new carbide fuel. In 1988 he became the Reactor Superintendent of FBTR. He removed the initial problems and raised the reactor power in steps, after commissioning of all the systems. The reactor was connected to the grid and electricity was generated in July 1997 at 10 MW power. In September 2002 the indigenously designed and fabricated fuel reached a burn up of 100,000 MWd/t without any failure. In 1985, he was designated as the Head of Nuclear Systems Division and was responsible for the preliminary design of 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR). He developed the capability in the centre to carry out sophisticated analysis for design. In 1992, he became the Director, Reactor Group and was responsible for the operation of FBTR and design and engineering R &D; of PFBR. He developed PFBR design safety criteria as per AERB norms. He served as the Member and Chairman of several committees of Department of Atomic Energy. In August 2000, he was promoted as Distinguished Scientist. In November 2000, he became the Director, Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research. He significantly contributed in design, R&D;, manufacturing technology development, obtained statutory clearances for construction and pre-project activities of PFBR. Financial approval for the PFBR project was obtained in September 2003 and the construction was started in August 2003 itself. A new PSU called Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited was established in October 2003 for the construction and operation of PFBR. Bhoje was one of the founder Directors of this company. Bhoje has published over 200 papers in journals and conferences. He represented India as a member of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) during 1987‚Äì1997. He was a member of the IAEA Senior Advisory Group on Nuclear Energy and also a member of a steering committee on Innovative Reactor and Fuel Cycle project. He has coordinated FBTR R&D;, funded by IGCAR and carried out in twenty five different educational institutions and research centres like Fluid Control Research Institute, Kirloskar Brothers Ltd, Pune. He retired from government service at the age of 62, on superannuation, in April 2004. After retirement, he has settled at Kolhapur in Maharashtra.

For example, it is used in Egyptology to ground Egyptian chronology to other Calendar eras. The main types of chronological synchronism are synchronisms with other historical chronologies and synchronisms with precisely datable astronomical events. Synchronisms with other chronologies often rely on some form of recorded communication between regions. For example, in Egyptology, the earliest such synchronisms appear in the 15th century BC, during the Amarna Period by the considerable quantity of diplomatic correspondence between Amenhotep III and Akhenaten and various Near Eastern monarchs; that links Egyptian chronology with other Near Eastern chronologies. Astronomical synchronisms rely on precise identification of astronomical events recorded in the historical record. The best known of these is the Sothic cycle whose careful study led Richard Anthony Parker to argue that the dates of the Twelfth dynasty of Egypt could be fixed with absolute precision.Set forth in \\"Excursus C: The Twelfth dynasty\\" in his The Calendars of ancient Egypt (Chicago: University Press, 1950). More recent research has eroded that confidence and questioned many of the assumptions used with the Sothic Cycle. As a result, experts have moved away from relying on it.One example is Patrick O'Mara, \\"Censorinus, the Sothic Cycle, and calendar year one in ancient Egypt: the Epistological problem\\", Journal of Near Eastern studies, 62 (2003), pp. 17-26.

It was founded in 1953. In 1961, Holiday Rambler‚Äôs introduction of aluminum body framing ushered in a new era of lighter, stronger and more durable recreational vehicles (RVs). This aluminum frame (Alumaframe) became the standard for lighter and stronger RVs for 40 years. Holiday Rambler was also responsible for many firsts; built-in refrigerators, holding tanks and aerodynamic radiused corners. As Holiday Rambler moved into motorhomes, they were the first with tag axles and the kitchen slide-out revolutionized \\"interior engineering\\" in the field.Holiday Rambler: Founded in 1953 Holiday Rambler was sold to Harley-Davidson in 1986 and later in 1996 to the Monaco Coach Corporation where its future, then under Navistar International Corp., was difficult in 2010 as it was for most motorhome manufacturers.Holiday RamblerThe Holiday Rambler RV: A Historic Look In May 2013, Holiday Rambler was sold by Navistar International Corp. to Allied Specialty Vehicles. History Company founder Richard Klingler started building trailer parts in a chicken coop and assembling the trailers outdoors in the 1950s in Wakarusa, Indiana. The Elkhart and Wakarusa ( south of Elkhart) area of Indiana became the recreational vehicle (then called \\"campers\\") capital of the US after World War II. The first Holiday Rambler recreational vehicle was a travel trailer introduced to the public in 1953 by the Klingler Corporation. A fully restored example is in the RV museum in Elkhart, Indiana. There is a watercolor painting of it by artist Paige Bridges. Holiday Rambler Corporation and its subsidiaries (\\"Holiday Rambler\\") was acquired by the Harley-Davidson, Inc. in December 1986. Holiday Rambler's Recreational Vehicle division competed primarily in the mid to premium segment of the recreational vehicle market. On March 4, 1996, the Monaco Coach Corporation of Oregon acquired from Harley-Davidson, Inc. certain assets of Holiday Rambler (the \\"Holiday Acquisition\\") in exchange for $21.5 million in cash, 65,217 shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock (which was subsequently converted into 230,767 shares of Common Stock), and the assumption of most of the liabilities of Holiday Rambler. Concurrently, the Company acquired ten Holiday World Dealerships for $13.0 million, including a $12.0 million subordinated.MONACO COACH CORPORATION May 19, 1999 FORM 10-K On June 23, 2009, Judge Kevin Carey agreed to the Monaco Coach Corporation's request to convert its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to a Chapter 7 case so it could liquidate its remaining assets. The order converting the case to Chapter 7 was effective June 30. Monaco Coach Corporation sold its factories, inventory, brands and intellectual property to Navistar International Corp. earlier in June for $47 million. Once the remaining assets were liquidated under Chapter 7, \\"the entity ceases to exist,\\" and effectively spelled the end of Monaco Coach Corporation.The Register-Guard: Monaco‚Äôs case in final phase - June 24, 2009 Models Holiday Rambler manufactures motorhomes, which travel on their own power, and towables, which are designed to be pulled by a motor vehicle.

First, it was built on the height of Kond district, in 1710, in the place of a medieval church ruined as the result of a destructive earthquake.

The rectangular plan of the church includes the prayer-hall and the main altar on the eastern side, attached to which are the sacristies. History Being concerned by the unattractive state of the church, in 1979, architect Rafael Israelyan presented to Catholicos of All Armenians Vazgen I a project of basic reconstruction of the church. The plan was improved, but unfortunately, the architect died the same year. After 10 years author's son, architect Areg Israyelian turned his father's initiative into a technical project, which was allowed to realize. The work project was prepared by the honored architect Baghdasar Arzoumanian and designing engineer Avetik Tekevejian. In 1980s the Church was entirely reconstructed and restored under the direct leadership of the civil engineer Mikayel Hovhannissian. The dome and the walls of the church were faced with tuf stone. Large-scale works were realized inside the church. In the western side an additional storey was built for the choir, the floor was paved with marble, the wall of the main altar was ornamented, the interior was renovated. Also the bell-tower of the church was built. In 2000 the educational-cultural center ‚ÄúHovhannes Kozern‚Äù was built nearby the church where foreign language and computer courses are organized, the school of Icon art functions.

Although they all bore the same name, the different versions of Zefir were actually quite different gliders in terms of materials used, design and performance. What unified them most was the person of the lead designer - Bugumi≈Ç Szuba and the use of large Fowler flaps to get superior (for the era) performance both at low and high-speed flight. The Zefir series (in particular Zefir-3, with its L/D of 42+) is perhaps the ultimate design of the wooden glider construction era. Intended to replace the SZD-8 Jask√≥≈Çka as the Polish team mount at the World Gliding Championships in 1958 in Leszno, the SZD-19 Zefir was a high-wing glider with a wooden and glass-fibre fuselage, retractable undercarriage and all-metal wings incorporating hydraulically actuated flaps. The first prototype SZD-19X Zefir flew on 31 December 1958, missing the 1958 championships, but the flight tests revealed problems with control and stability as well as operation of the flaps and complexity of the hydraulic system. The SZD-19 was totally re-designed with all-wooden wings, revised fuselage and tail section, and towing hook relocated to the retractable undercarriage chassis, designated as the SZD-19-2 Zefir 2, first flying on 11 March 1960, showing a marked improvement over the Zefir. Two prototypes of the Zefir 2 were built, flying in the 1960 World Championships at K√∂ln in Germany to gain second, piloted by Edward Makula, and third, piloted by Jerzy Popiel, places in the Open class. With significant success in the World Championships, the SZD-19-2 was refined with new stabilisers and landing gear to become the SZD-19-2 Zefir 2A, flying for the first time in 1962, in time for the 1963 World Championships, 1963 WGC newsreel held in Argentina, where Makula and Popiel took first and second places. As a result of these successes, demand for the SZD-19-2 was significant with 14 units built, most being sold to other countries, (according to some sources, 20 SZD-19-2A units were constructed.). From the beginning until (and including) Zefir 3 these gliders did not have spoilers (airbrakes) - a tail chute was used. The chute drag could be controlled by the pilot (in versions 2B and 3). Several records were established by the Zefir 2A/B's, including; a flight distance of and a closed triangle speed record of 102 km/h (63.4 mph). To improve the performance, further development with wings extended to 19m was carried out as the SZD-29 Zefir 3, of which two prototypes were built, and the Open-class 19m SZD-31 Zefir 4 of which three were built. Two SZD-31 Zefir 4's competed in the 1968 World Gliding Championships at Leszno with mediocre (mainly due to the unrecognized issue of an air leak through airbrake housings) results - they took 14th and 28th place. Because the Zefir series pushed the limits of a wooden wing construction, all construction elements were carefully designed with unusually narrow tolerance margins. Jerzy ≈ömielkiewicz (of the design team) describes a catastrophic in-flight wing failure of one of Zefir's caused by a careless minor change of the design of a few rivet placements - the whole original design was accounting for forces resulting from and/or involving individual rivets. Handling characteristic Historical accounts report that all the Zefir versions required superior piloting abilities but the modern restoration aircraft is reported to be docile. Until Zefir 4 they had no airbrakes (spoilers) which had caused multiple landing incidents. A chute (except Zefir 4) was used for braking, from 2B version the pilot could adjust the chute drag. The forward visibility was considered poor. Similarly, the controls required substantial force, were causing strain for the pilots and in general their ergonomics was not optimal. All these inconveniences were the result of the design striving to squeeze every possible bit of performance (hence i.e. narrow cockpit with uncomfortably prone pilot position), handling comfort was considered second. One of the test pilots (Jan Gawƒôcki) recalls that the introduction of airbrakes in the Zefir 4 model was welcomed by the pilots, despite their dreadful influence (L/D down to 34 from 43+) on glider performance. Also, Zefir 3 had substantial horizontal stabilizer flatter issues.  Variants  *SZD-19x Zefir ‚Äì The first prototype with metal wings and hydraulically actuated flaps, one built *SZD-19-2 Zefir 2 ‚Äì Two prototypes of re-designed Zefir with wooden wings, manual flap operation and other improvements.

The first prototype (SP-2465) flew on 26 April 1965, piloted by Stanis≈Çaw Skrzydlewski. A second prototype was also built. Considered by some to be the crowning achievement in wooden construction glider design. *SZD-31 Zefir 4 - An attempted refinement of the Zefir 3, with similar dimensions. Introduced spoilers caused drastically inferior performance (L/D down to 34 due to leakage through the spoiler box). Three aircraft were built.

A strut is usually formed from a metal sheet, folded over into an open channel shape with inwards-curving lips to provide additional stiffness and as a location to mount interconnecting components. Increasingly, struts are being constructed from fiberglass, a highly corrosion-resistant material that's known for its lightweight strength and rigidity.http://ecmweb.com/content/wire-management Struts usually have holes of some sort in the base, to facilitate interconnection or fastening strut to underlying building structures. The main advantage of strut channels in construction is that there are many options available for rapidly and easily connecting lengths together and other items to the strut channel, using various specialized strut-specific fasteners and bolts. They can be assembled very rapidly with minimal tools and only moderately trained labor, which reduces costs significantly in many applications. A strut channel installation also can often be modified or added-to relatively easily if needed. The only alternative to strut channels for most applications is custom fabrication using steel bar stock and other commodity components, requiring welding or extensive drilling and bolting, which has none of the above advantages. In US units, the basic typical strut channel forms a box 1 5/8 inch by 1 5/8 inch. In metric units, this is a 41 mm by 41 mm unit. There are several additional sizes and combined shapes manufactured.  Shapes  Cross section diagram of standard strut channel Basic strut channel comes in the open box section, 1 5/8 by 1 5/8 inch square cross section. A half height (1 5/8 inch wide, 13/16 inch tall) cross section version is also available, used mostly where mounted directly to a wall as it has significantly less stiffness and ability to carry loads across an open space or brace. A deep channel 2 7/16 inches tall and 1 5/8 inch wide is also manufactured. The material used to form the channel is typically 12 gauge (0.1046 inch) or 14 gauge (0.0747 inch) thick sheet metal. Types of channel Several variations are available with different hole patterns for mounting to walls and supports. Solid channel has no holes predrilled, and must either be drilled on site or mounted in another fashion. Punched channel has round holes, large enough for 5/8 inch threaded steel rod or bolts, punched in the top of the channel at regular 1 7/8 inch centers. Half-slot channel has short, rounded end rectangular slots punched out on 2 inch centers. Slot channel has longer slots on 4 inch centers. In addition, shapes are manufactured with two lengths of channel welded together back to back, or three or four welded together in various patterns, to form stronger structural elements.  Materials  Strut is normally made of sheet steel, with a zinc coating (galvanized), paint, epoxy, powder coat, or other finish. Strut channel is also manufactured from stainless steel for use where rusting might become a problem (e.g., outdoors, facilities with corrosive materials), from aluminium alloy when weight is an issue or from fiberglass for very corrosive environments.http://outsideplant.colonialteltek.com/Asset/BENEFITS-OF- FIBERGLASS-CONDUIT.pdf  Standards  The \\"Metal Framing Manufacturers Association\\" (MFMA) defines a standard for strut channel construction that allows multiple manufacturers' channels to be compatible. The current version of the standard, as of 2020Unistrut US Website, retrieved 2020-08-13, at https://www.unistrut.us/resources/faqs/faq, is MFMA-4. Well-known manufacturers of strut channel, including Unistrut U.S., Cooper Industries/Eaton Corporation, and Thomas & Betts Corp./ABB Group, are members ofMFMA Website, retrieved 2020-08-13, http://www.metalframingmfg.org/members.cfm the MFMA and defined the standard.  Interconnection  The inwards-facing lips on the open side of strut channel are routinely used to mount special nuts, braces, connecting angles, and other types of interconnection mechanism or device to join lengths of strut channel together or connect pipes, wire, other structures, threaded rod, bolts, or walls into the strut channel structural system.  Usage  File:StrutHanger.JPGAn overhead electrical wire hanger manufactured from two lengths of strut channel and two lengths of threaded rod. File:StrutJoint.JPGA length of standard half-slotted strut channel used as a brace, connected to a length of half-channel mounted directly to a wall, joined with a purpose-built channel connecting steel angle. File:StrutShelf.JPGA shelf supporting electrical conduit and pipe, manufactured from strut channel Strut channel is used to mount, brace, support, and connect lightweight structural loads in building construction. These include pipes, electrical and data wire, mechanical systems such as ventilation, air conditioning, and other mechanical systems. Objects can be attached to the strut channel with a bolt, threaded into a channel nut, that may have a spring to ease installation. Circular objects such as pipes or cables may be attached with straps that have a shaped end to be retained by the channel. Strut channel is also used for other applications that require a strong framework, such as workbenches, shelving systems, equipment racks, etc. Specially made sockets are available to tighten nuts, bolts, etc. inside the channel, as normal sockets are unable to fit through the opening.

The station, established in 1986, is currently owned by Cochise Media Licenses, LLC. The station is a member of the New Mexico Broadcasters Association. Programming KPSA-FM broadcasts a classic rock music format. In addition to its usual music programming, KPSA-FM broadcasts Major League Baseball games as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks radio network. History =Launch= This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on May 22, 1984. The new station was assigned the KXKK call sign by the FCC on August 6, 1984. In October 1986, permit holders Charles R. Crisler and John W. Krehbiel, doing business as Interstate 10 Broadcasting of New Mexico, applied to the FCC to transfer the permit for the still-under construction KXKK to a new corporation called Interstate 10 Broadcasting of New Mexico, Inc. The transfer was approved by the FCC on June 30, 1987, and the transaction was consummated on August 18, 1987. After several extensions and engineering modifications, KXKK finally received its license to cover from the FCC on September 22, 1989. =KQTN= In July 1994, after an aborted attempt to sell the station the previous year, Interstate 10 Broadcasting of New Mexico, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Loretta L. Farrier. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 14, 1995, and the transaction was consummated on August 14, 1995. The new owner had the FCC change the station's call sign to KQTN on January 31, 1997. In May 1998, Loretta L. Farrier, announced a deal to sell KQTN to LuRunn Broadcasting System, LLC. The deal was approved by the FCC on September 1, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on October 20, 1998. In October 1999, LuRunn Broadcasting System owner Phillip H. Runnels applied to transfer control of this station to Dewey Matthew Runnels as part of a multi- station deal valued at $180,000. The transfer was approved by the FCC on December 20, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on January 20, 2000. At the time of the transfer, KQTN's signal was dark. Shortly thereafter, the company changed its name to Runnels Broadcasting System, LLC. =KPSA-FM= Facing financial difficulties, the broadcast license for KQTN was involuntarily transferred in August 2002 from Runnels Broadcasting System, LLC, to Runnels Broadcasting System, LLC, as Debtor-In-Possession. The transfer was approved by the FCC and consummated on September 19, 2002. The station was assigned new call sign KPSA-FM by the FCC on October 22, 2002. As the financial issues continued, the license was again involuntarily transferred, this time from Runnels Broadcasting System, LLC, as Debtor-In- Possession to Linda S. Bloom acting as bankruptcy trustee for Runnels Broadcasting System, LLC. The transfer was approved by the FCC on January 7, 2005, and the transaction was consummated on January 10, 2005. In February 2006, with approval from the bankruptcy court, trustee Linda S. Bloom reached an agreement to sell KPSA-FM to SkyWest Media subsidiary SkyWest Licenses New Mexico, LLC, as part of a three-station deal valued at $565,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on March 28, 2006, and the transaction was consummated on June 1, 2006. =Sale= In July 2009, SkyWest Media, through its Skywest Licenses New Mexico, LLC, subsidiary, reached an agreement to sell this station to Cochise Media Licenses, LLC, as part of a three-station deal in exchange for $552,000 in debt forgiveness. SkyWest Media is owned by Ted Tucker Jr. and Cochise Media Licenses is owned by his father, Ted Tucker Sr. This application was accepted for filing on July 13, 2009, and granted on October 9, 2009. Construction permit KPSA-FM applied to the FCC in July, 2010 for a construction permit that would allow them to change broadcast frequencies to 97.9 MHz, dramatically increase its effective radiated power from 250 to 43,000 watts, raise its antenna to in height above average terrain, and relocate its transmitter site northeast to 32¬∞34'57\\"N, 108¬∞25'29\\"W. The improvements will increase the coverage area of the KPSA-FM broadcast signal. The FCC granted the permit on August 26, 2010, and the permit is scheduled to expire on August 26, 2013.

It is one of seven short stories previously published in the early 1980s in venues such as the New Yorker, Grand Street, Antaeus, and the Hudson Review. Like Millhauser's two novels (Edwin Mulhouse and Portrait of a Romantic), they are about the ability of artists and children to see things anew, to remake things through the force of their own romantic yearnings, and the dangerous consequences of that gift.American Gothic Tales: Edited by Joyce Carol Oates, New York: Plume, 1996.  Plot summary  The short story begins with a young narrator whom on his twelfth birthday visits an amusement park he has not been to for over two years. He has longed to re-visit the penny arcade ‚ÄúI had dreamed of it all that tense, enigmatic summer‚Ä¶‚ÄùMichiko Kakutani. \\"Books of the Times\\". The New York Times. January 12, 1986. and when approaching it has his mother and father wait outside. He steps into darkness and hears the familiar sounds of the penny arcade. He passes older teenagers and strolls past familiar games such as a toy derrick, and pinball machine. But he came for something else, something ‚Äúmysterious and elusive.‚ÄùPatrick Smith. Steven Millhauser. Entrepreneur. June 2008. He came across an old fortune teller and sees for the first time how the games have aged by her sullen appearance and general deterioration that comes with use. He walks further in to find a cowboy no one was paying attention to, eventually coming to a section of old machines near the back of the arcade. He wandered aimlessly looking for something that would catch his eye until he came upon a section of the arcade roped off and covered with cloths. He becomes excited thinking that they were the machines that enticed him the first time he visited the arcade. After believing a mysterious hush came over the arcade he returns to the front approaching the cowboy once more. He plays with a few of the machines and begins to understand the creatures of the arcade, seeing them in a new light. When he leaves the arcade back into the sunshine under the August sky, he is satisfactory with his visit.

Apostolos Santas (; 22 February 1922 ‚Äì 30 April 2011), commonly known as Lakis, was a Greek veteran of the Resistance against the Axis Occupation of Greece during World War II, most notable for his participation, along with Manolis Glezos, in the taking down of the German flag from the Acropolis on 30 May 1941. Biography Apostolos Santas was born in 1922 in Patras, while his roots were from the Ionian island of Lefkada. His family moved to Athens in 1934. He completed his secondary education in Athens and was accepted to the law school of the University of Athens, completing his law studies after the liberation of the country from Nazi occupation in 1944. On the night of 30 May 1941, he and Manolis Glezos climbed on the Acropolis of Athens and tore down the Nazi flag, which had been there since 27 April, when the Nazi forces had entered and occupied Athens, leaving the flagpole empty. That was one of the first resistance acts in Greece. The act inspired the Greeks to resist occupation, and made the two into folk heroes. The Germans responded by sentencing Glezos and Santas to death in absentia. In 1942, he joined the fledgling National Liberation Front (EAM), and a year later the guerrilla force ELAS, with which he participated in several battles with the Axis troops throughout Central Greece. After the Occupation, because of his leftist beliefs, he was sent into internal exile to Ikaria in 1946, then to Psyttaleia in 1947 and finally to the Makronisos island in 1948. He managed to escape to Italy, from where he went to Canada where he was granted political asylum. He lived in Canada until 1962, when he returned to Greece, where he spent the rest of his life. On 30 April 2011 he died in Athens, aged 89. Santas received numerous awards from various institutions in Greece and other Allied countries.

Development  The SZD-20X Wampir II (vampire II) was designed to compare a flying wing designed to Standard class rules with a more conventional standard class glider. Main designer was Jan Dyrek. Based on experience with the earlier SZD-6X Nietoperz and SZD-13 Wampir tail- less gliders, the SZD-20X was an all wood flying wing, with the pilot sitting in a pod extending aft of the trailing edge on the centreline, and large swept fins & rudders at approx 2/3 span on each wing. The SZD-20X was associated with the number 15, having a 15m span, aspect ratio of 15 and wing area of 15m¬≤, whether this was by design or accident is not known. Early flight trials commenced with hops towed behind a car to test control responses, followed by an aero-tow launch on 9 September 1959, piloted by Adam Zientek. Flight trials revealed a marked sensitivity to turbulence resulting in flutter, and during trials at stalling speed, the SZD-20X entered a spin, which the rudders were unable to recover the aircraft from, only when the pilot shifted his weight as far forward as he could, did the SZD-20X recover from the spin. Flying in the SZD-20X continued until 6 October 1959, when turbulence-induced flutter tore the aircraft apart, the pilot escaping with parachute.

He was later a member of the Legislative Council. Early life Reed was the youngest son of George McCullagh Reed, a newspaper proprietor, and Jessie Chalmers Reed (n√©e Ranken). He was born in Auckland, where his father had moved to in circa 1870 after several years in Queensland, Australia. An elder brother was John Reed. Reed received his education at Victoria College, Jersey, Dulwich College, London, and the University of Sydney, New South Wales. He was in England from 1878 to 1887. In 1889, he joined the Daily Telegraph and in 1891 moved to The Sydney Morning Herald where he also stayed for two years. He moved to Kawakawa in the Bay of Islands at the end of 1893 or 1895 (sources differ) and commenced legal studies. He took over his brother's legal practice upon his brother's move to Auckland in 1896. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1899, and five years later, he was admitted as a barrister. Reed was clerk and treasurer to the Bay of Islands County. Reed played cricket as a batter and bowler, representing both Dulwich College in 1886 and the Bay of Islands in 1897. He also played rugby union as a forward and represented Auckland Province in 1889, Victoria in 1890, New South Wales Colony in 1891 and 1892 and the Hawke's Bay Province in 1895. While in the Hawke's Bay, Reed captained the Waipawa Branch Union. Political career Reed won the Bay of Islands electorate in the 1908 general election as a candidate of the Liberal Party. The resulted in significant losses for the Liberal Party and Joseph Ward's government survived a no-confidence motion on the casting vote of the speaker only. Ward chose to resign, though, and made way for a new liberal Prime Minister, Thomas Mackenzie. Reed expected to be part of the new cabinet and the media discussed that he might be appointed Attorney-General due to his legal background. Reed was invited to cabinet, but he did not join because the majority of the cabinet did not support his views of freehold. When the Mackenzie government faced a no-confidence vote in July 1912, Reed voted with the opposition, thus effectively joining the Reform Party. Reed's switch to Reform caused problems in the . George Wilkinson had been the Reform candidate in the Bay of Islands electorate in 1911, he was keen to represent Reform in that electorate in 1914, and he had the backing of the local electorate committee. Reed also wanted to run for Reform, and as he had the backing of the party head office, he was declared the official Reform candidate. Reed narrowly won the election against Te Rangi Hƒ´roa of the Liberal Party, with Wilkinson coming third. Bill Veitch, at the time a United Labour Party MP in Wanganui, claimed that Wilkinson had been under immense pressure from the Reform Party not to contest the Bay of Islands election, and that William Massey had promised him a seat in the Legislative Council in return, an allegation later picked up by other media outlets but also implicating Reed in the affair. This complaint was elevated to a formal election petition in April 1915 by Kawakawa resident Edward Evans, who engaged a King's Counsel, John Findlay, and a solicitor, Bill Endean, as his counsel. Reed used his brother, also a King's Counsel, as his counsel. The primary complaint was that Reed had, through an intermediary, tried to convince Wilkinson to retire by promising him a seat on the Legislative Council, and to reimburse him for his election campaign expenses. On 8 May 1915, the petition was upheld Justice Chapman and Justice Hosking, the election declared void, and Reed barred from standing in another election for one year. Since 1913, there have been over 100 by-elections held in New Zealand, and this was one of only five cases where a general election was declared void by the courts. The resulting by-election was won by William Stewart in June . Reed won the electorate again in after Stewart's resignation, and was defeated in 1922. He was later appointed a member of the Legislative Council, from 1924 to 1931. In 1932, he hosted the Governor- General, The Viscount Bledisloe, and showed him the run-down and forgotten Busby house where the Treaty of Waitangi had been signed in 1840. The Viscount Bledisloe purchased the estate and gifted it to the nation; the Treaty House has since been registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place with registration number 6. Reed later wrote a book about the Bledisloe gift. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Reed joined the National Party and was one of the Auckland agitators against Adam Hamilton and for Charles Wilkinson. =Marriage= St Paul's Church in 1909 On 28 April 1909, Reed married Eila Mabel Williams at St Paul's Church in Auckland. His wife was from the family of missionaries who came to New Zealand from the 1820s on behalf of the Church Missionary Society. Her grandfather was Henry Williams, and her father was the runholder Thomas Coldham Williams (1825‚Äì1912). The portrait painter William Beetham was her maternal grandfather. The wedding ceremony was conducted by her father's cousin, Leonard Williams, who was Bishop of Waiapu. Her second cousin, archbishop Herbert Williams, assisted his father with the service. Her younger sister Enid \\"Githa\\" Williams had married Royal Navy officer James Fergusson in 1901 in England; he was later to become Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. Her elder sister Maude Burge n√©e Williams was a New Zealand painter who lived in Saint-Tropez and was the painting companion of Frances Hodgkins Her husband's eldest brother, Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet, was the 3rd Governor- General of New Zealand (1924‚Äì1930).

Life and work P√≠o Collivadino was born in Buenos Aires, in 1869. He studied drawing at the Italian Argentine cultural society, the Societ√° Nazionale de Buenos Aires, and in 1889, he traveled to Rome, where in 1891 he was accepted into the Accademia di San Luca, the National Academy of Fine Arts. There, he was mentored by Cesare Mariani, and collaborated in decorative frescoes in the Constitutional Court of Italy.Biograf√≠as y vidas: P√≠o Collivadino Parker, William Belmont. Argentines of Today. New York: The Hispanic Society of America, 1920. He returned to Argentina in 1896 and became known for his romanticist lithographs. Colllivadino attended three international festivals in Venice, from 1903 to 1907, where his La hora del reposo (Workday Break, 1903), also known as La hora del almuerzo (Lunch break time) earned a gold medal. He was also at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, in St. Louis, where he earned a silver and a gold medal. La hora del almuerzo, 1903. These successes encouraged him to transition to Post-impressionism, a genre which had not yet found favor among Argentine art patrons, and he joined the Nexus Group in 1907. The group, led by painters Fernando Fader and Mart√≠n Malharro, and sculptor Rogelio Yrurtia, braved initial ostracism and helped popularize the genre locally. Honored with the Order of the Crown of Italy in 1905, Collivadino became an honorary member of the Accademia di Brera, in Milan.Arte de la Argentina: Collivadino Collivadino remained sought-after in Argentina, and served in numerous art juries. He was named Director of the Academy of Fine Arts in 1908, and was prominent in Buenos Aires' Centennial International Exposition, in 1910. Subsequent years saw the creation of Collivadino's best-known works, including Usinas (Power Plants, 1914). Collivadino was named director of scenography at the renowned Col√≥n Theatre and remained head of the Academy of Fine Arts and taught there until his retirement in 1935. He helped organize the Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n School of Fine Arts in 1939, and the Ernesto de la C√°rcova Museum, in 1941. Collivadino served as the director of the Pueyrred√≥n School until 1944, when he was forced to retire by the new military regime of General Pedro Pablo Ram√≠rez (a dictatorship whose cultural policy was hostile to European influences, in favor of what it described as \\"criollo virtues\\").Crawley, Eduardo.

It can help to prevent tooth decay and gum disease. History Chew sticks are twigs or roots of certain plants that are chewed until one end is frayed. This end can be used to brush against the teeth, while the other end can be used as a toothpick. Most commonly plants are used that have a high content of tannins (astringent and antibacterial) or other compounds that benefit the health of gums and teeth. The earliest chew sticks have been dated to Babylonia in 3500 BC and an Egyptian tomb from 3000 BC; they are mentioned in Chinese records dating from 1600 BC and in the Tipitaka,Dantaka·π≠·π≠ha sutta (AN 5.208) MahƒÅsa·πÖgƒ´ti Tipi·π≠aka Buddhavasse 2500 the Buddhist Canon, purported to be giving account of events which took place in the north-western India around the 5th century BC. In Africa, chew sticks are made from the tree Salvadora persica, also known as the \\"toothbrush tree\\". In Islam, this tree is traditionally used to create a chew stick called miswak, as frequently advocated for in the hadith (written traditions relating to the life of Muhammad). Even today, many Indians in rural areas use neem twigs for brushing every morning. It has antibacterial properties and helps keep gums healthy. It is known to reduce many gum related diseases. Traditional Sikhs still use datun today as it is written in their scriptures: Twigs used kikar (babool) at Hodal in Faridabad, Haryana, India Neem (Azadirachta indica) in Hyderabad, India Teeth-cleaning twigs can be obtained from a variety of tree species. Although many trees are used in the production of teeth-cleaning twigs, some trees are better suited to clean and protect the teeth, due to the chemical composition of the plant parts. The tree species are: * Salvadora persica * Sassafras * Gumtree * Lime tree (Citrusaurantafolia) * Garcinia mannii in West AfricaCheek (2004) * Orange tree (Citrus √ó sinensis) * African laburnum (Cassia sieberiana) * Tea tree * Neem in the Indian subcontinent * Vachellia nilotica, also called babool or kikar in the Indian subcontinent * Dalbergia sissoo, also called sheesham in the Indian subcontinent * Liquorice * Gouania lupuloides * Cinnamon * Dogwood * Olive * Walnut * Acacia catechu * Acacia nilotica * and other trees with bitter roots.

Advantages When compared to toothbrushes, teeth-cleaning twigs have several advantages: * More ecological in its life-cycle * Lower cost (0‚Äì16% of the cost of a toothbrush) * Independence from external supplier if made at home from privately owned trees * Low maintenance, with some twigs needing moistening with water if they become dry, to ensure the end is soft. The end may be cut afresh to ensure hygiene, and should not be stored near a sink. The twig is replaced every few weeks to maintain proper hygiene. * No need for toothpaste On the other hand, different species of trees have various levels of hardness just as synthetic toothbrushes would, so careful selection of the right hardness is required before use. Excessive scrubbing too can also bring the risk of gum damage, though this is a concern for plastic toothbrushes as well.

Life He studied at Clare Hall, Cambridge, where he matriculated 1653. He graduated B.A.in 1657 and M.A. in 1660. He was appointed rector of St. Michael, Harbledown, in 1670, and vicar of St. Cosmus and Damian on the Blean, two parishes near Canterbury, in 1679. James II nominated him on 12 November 1688 as Dean of Rochester, in succession to John Castilion. He was instituted by Bishop Thomas Sprat, but his installation was put off when it was discovered that he had taken no higher degree than M.A., and the statutes required that he should be at least B.D. Although he took the degree of D.D, 18 January 1689, he was not installed, and William III shortly afterwards appointed Henry Ullock in his place. Lowth declined the oath of allegiance to William, and was in consequence suspended from his functions in August 1689, and in the following February deprived of both his livings; he made a fraudulent agreement with his successor in the vicarage. He probably lived the rest of his life in London, and died there 3 July 1720, aged nearly 90, He was buried in the new cemetery, St. George's parish, Queen's Square. Works Lowth's works are in defence of an episcopal succession against any right of deposition by a civil magistrate, and in favour of the nonjuring schism. Their titles are: * 'Of the Subject of Church Power, in whom it resides, its Force, Extent, and Execution,' London, 1685, containing letters addressed to Edward Stillingfleet and John Tillotson, charging them with Erastianism. Tillotson took no notice.

Since she was a child, Kseniya painted, drew and designed with her mother. Simonova's parents discouraged her from a career as an artist. Kseniya explained, \\"It is a constant struggle. I knew that, and was ready for it. If you chose this profession, you're struggling all your life. You do not enjoy everyday life - like comfort, and buying furniture... You're always looking for something more, and actually, I was never interested in a life of comfort and buying furniture.\\" In 2007 Simonova married Igor Paskar, a theatre director, journalist and magazine editor.

In 1653 when Prince Aurangzeb was appointed the viceroy of the Deccan for the second time, he made Fatehnagar his capital and called it Aurangabad. Aurangabad is sometimes referred to as Khujista Bunyad by the chroniclers of Aurangzeb's reign. History Malik Ambar made it his capital and the men of his army raised their dwellings around it. Within a decade, Kharki became a populous and imposing city. Malik Ambar cherished strong love and ability for architecture. Aurangabad was Ambar's architectural achievement and creation. However, 1621, it was ravaged and burnt down by the imperial troops under Jahangir. Ambar the founder of the city was always referred to by harsh names by Emperor Jahangir. In his memoirs, he never mentions his name without prefixing epithets like wretch, cursed fellow, Habshi, Ambar Siyari, black Ambar, and Ambar Badakhtur. Malik Ambar died in 1626.Qureshi Dulari, \\"Tourism Potential in Aurangabad,\\" p.6 He was succeeded by his son Fateh Khan, who changed the name of Kharki to Fatehnagar. In the same year, the Moghal viceroy Khan Jahan Lodi, advanced on the city, but retired to Burhanpur on being bribed by the Nizam Shahi Commander, Hamid Khan. With the capture of Daulatabad Fort by the imperial troops in 1633, the Nizam Shahi dominions, including Fatehnagar, came under the possession of the Moghals. In 1653 when Prince Aurangzeb was appointed the viceroy of the Deccan for the second time, he made Fatehnagar his capital and called it Aurangabad. Aurangabad is sometimes referred to as Khujista Bunyad by the Chroniclers of Aurangzeb's reign. Zeb-un-Nisa's palace, Aurangabad 1880s Panchakki, Baba Shah Mosafar Dargah 1880s In March 1666, accompanied by a body of 1,000 select troops, Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj arrived at Aurangabad on his way to Agra. Safshikan Khan, the governor of Aurangabad, treated him with scant respect. For this act, he was severely reprimanded by Jai Singh and made to pay a courtesy call on Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In 1668, the city nearly became a scene of a conflict between the imperial troops under Diler Khan, and those commanded by Prince Muazzam, the viceroy. In 1681, after plundering Burhanpur, the Marathas assembled in the neighbourhood of the Satara hills in order to attack Aurangabad. The plan was, however, abandoned on hearing of the arrival of the viceroy, Khan Jahan Bahadur. In the same year, Khan Jahan Bahadur erected a wall around Aurangabad to protect it against surprise attacks of the Marathas. It was done at the order of the Emperor, and cost rupees three lakhs. Two years later, the Emperor himself arrived at Aurangabad. Bibi Ka Maqbara 1880s Bibi Ka Maqbara is a monument built in 1660 by Aurangzeb's son, Azam Shah, as a loving tribute to his mother, Dilras Bano Begam. In 1692, he ordered a magnificent palace to be erected near the great reservoir to the north of the city - the ruins of which are now to be seen in the Killa Ark. A fortified wall was thrown round the suburb of Begampura in 1696 AD. Shortly after the death of Aurangzeb, the city of Aurangabad slipped from the hands of the Moghals. In 1720, Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, a distinguished General of Aurangzeb with the intention of founding his own dynasty in the Deccan, arrived at Aurangabad. He paid a visit to Delhi in 1723, but returned in 1724 , defying the orders of Emperor Muhammad Shah. Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah II transferred his capital from Aurangabad to Hyderabad in 1763. Street View Aurangabad 1868 The Emperor ordered Mubariz Khan, the Subhedar of the Deccan to oppose the Nizam. A battle was fought near Sakharkherda, subsequently called Fatehkherda, in which Murbariz Khan was defeated and killed. Raghoji, a young scion of the house of the Jadhavs of Sindkhed who fought on the side of the Moghals was also killed. Incensed at the support lent by the Jadhavs to Mubariz Khan, the Nizam despatched a posse of troops to Deulgaon to capture the Jadhav family. But being informed of the design the family escaped to Satara and sought asylum with Chhatrapati Shahu. At the intervention of Shahu the Jagir was restored back to the Jadhavs. In 1853, Aurangabad was the scene of a conflict between the contingent troops and a body of Arab mercenaries (Chaush) belonging to Mansing Rav, the Raja of Devalgaon. The Arabs placed the Raja under restraint, and threatened his life because their pay was in arrears. Brigadier Mayne, commanding the station, being apprised of the situation, marched out in the first week of October, with the 5th regiment cavalry, 6th regiment infantry, and a battery of artillery to Jasvantpura, just outside the Roshangate, where the Arabs had posted themselves. After a stiff resistance, the Arabs were defeated and dispersed and the Raja was released. In the action that was fought the Contingent lost 15 killed and 40 were wounded. Among those killed was Lieut. Boswell, and among those wounded Lieut. Vaughan, and Captain Parker. Both of them succumbed to their wounds later. 1857 War of Independence The Indian Mutiny: General Woodburn's Moveable Brigade Aurungabad 1857 The year 1857 was eventful in the history of Aurangabad with the rest of the country. The British moved the first cavalry from Mominabad (Ambejogai) to Aurangabad, in order to relieve 3rd cavalry which had marched to Malegaon, and was the first regiment to show signs of disaffection. The 2nd Infantry also came under suspicion. It was also feared that the people of the city might join hands with the troops. In order to prevent this, all the precautionary measures were taken and two companies of infantry were ordered to guard the bridge which spans the river Kham and separates the cantonment area from the spot where the cavalry was encamped. This precautionary measure on the part of the British alarmed the cavalry, and the men turning out without orders threw pickets in the direction of the cantonment. The authorities at Hyderabad were kept informed of the course of events by express. Upon this, a column of troops was ordered to march from Pune to Aurangabad. In the meanwhile, the artillery was also showing signs of rebellion, but the rumour of Bombay troops marching towards Aurangabad had a quieting effect. The men of the cavalry also returned to their posts. The Pune force was under the command of General Woodburn, and consisted of three troops of, the 14th Hussars under Captain Gall, Captain Woodcombe's battery of European artillery, and the 24th Bombay infantry under Colonel Folliot. Upon his arrival, General Woodburn marched straight to the encampment of the 3rd Cavalry, and the disaffected regiment was ordered out to a dismounted parade. The rissaldar of the first troop was directed to call out the names of the revolutionaries, and commenced by giving the name of the senior jamadar, who ordered his men to load their carbines. By this time the General with his staff and the English officers were mixed up with the disaffected troops, and hence the guns could not be used to put down the latter. In the confusion that followed, some of the troopers broke away, ran to their horses and fled away. The guns were fired upon them and the Hussars were sent in pursuit; but several of them managed to escape. A dafadar of the cavalry, Mir Fida Ali by name, fired a shot at his commanding officer, Captain Abbott. For this act of his, he was tried by a drum-head court-martial and hanged. The court-martial continued its sittings, and 24 men were condemned, of whom 21 were shot and 3 blown away from guns. About two-thirds of the regiment which had remained quiet was marched to Edalabad and recruited to its full strength by men from the other three regiments of the cavalry. Subsequently, the third cavalry served throughout the campaign under Sir Hugh Rose.

Aurangzeb caused a wall to be built round the city in 1682, during the second viceroyalty of Khan Jahan, in order to protect it from the sporadic attacks of the Marathas. Begampura was similarly fortified in 1696. The city wall is terraced, and is of solid masonry. It is of no great height, at places not more than fourteen feet. The battlements are loopholed for musketry, and the merlins over the gateways and at certain places along the wall, are machicolated. Semicircular bastions surmounted by towers, occur at each flanking angle, and at regular intervals along the works. The total length of the wall is a little over six miles. The wall has not been able to survive the ravages of time and lies practically in rains. It was pierced with thirteen gateways, exclusive of a small postern wicket. The four principal gates faced the cardinal points and consisted of the Delhi gate on the north, the Jalna gate on the east, the Paithan gate on the south, and the Mecca gate on the west. Besides these, there were the Jaffar, Khirki, Barapul, Mahmud, Roshan, Khizi, Khadgar, Mada and Kumhar gates. The Barapul had also been walled up for some time; and at a distance of three-fourths of a mile from it, the city road runs through a large square stone gateway, called Barkul, ascribed to Malik Ambar. The town has spilt much beyond the fortifications. Dr. Bradley in his 'Statistics of the City of Aurangabad' gives a picturesque description of the city and its environs as he viewed it from the tower upon the corner bastion at the north-east angle of the city wall: \\"Below is seen the town partly lying in the hollow and partly covering the high grounds rising all round, except towards the north-east and south-west, which is the direction of a valley where a perennial stream meanders. The buildings are neatly concealed in thick foliage, and were it not for a dome or minaret peering out here and there, the observer might imagine that he was gazing upon a forest. Beautiful clumps of mango and tamarind trees, upon the outskirts increase the illusion. Seldom is a more varied and beautiful landscape than is here presented; and the palms and minarets scattered about the town, confer a character peculiarly eastern upon the scenery. Looking westward beyond the city walls, the... cantonment is seen occupying a large space of ground. Further in the distance two or three isolated bills observed cutting the horizon. On the summit of one of them stands the remarkable fortress of Daulatabad; and behind it the bluff headland of the northern range fades way into misty indistinctness\\".

The species can be differentiated from other Eudocima moths by the presence of small central black dot in each hindwing. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1767 12th edition of Systema Naturae. Description The wingspan is about 60‚Äì96 mm. Palpi with third joint long and spatulate at extremity. Forewings with crenulate cilia in both sexes. Male has greenish-grey head and thorax. Abdomen orange. Forewings greenish grey with very numerous faint striated reddish lines. There are three rufous spots which can be seen at end of cell. A dark oblique line from near apex to centre of inner margin. A silvery patch found on vein 1 and another below lower angle of cell. A marginal black band with crenulate inner edge. There is a series of white cilia spots. Ventral side is orange. Forewings with costa and apical area blotched with rufous. Oblique postmedial and sub-apical black bands can be seen. Hindwings with apical area blotched with rufous. A black spot found on costa and another beyond lower angle of cell. A marginal black band runs from vein 5 to anal angle. Female much more prominently striated with rufous coloured forewings. The silvery patches found below and beyond cell very large and conjoined crossed by white streaks above vein 2 and beyond cell. Classification Some older authors have considered Eudocima apta as a synonym of E. materna but more recent workers consider E. apta as a New World species that is very similar in appearance to E. materna (Eudocima apta (Walker, [1858]) = Eudocima materna of authors, not Linnaeus, 1767). Eudocima materna is therefore the Old World counterpart of E. apta, and a simple visual comparison of E. materna and E. apta reveals obvious differences of the two species in both sexes. Alberto Zilli and Willem Hogenes (2002) also report genitalic differences between the two species, most notably in the bursa. Ecology The caterpillars are known to feed on Cocculus, Lycopersicon, Malus pumila, Mangifera indica, Musa √ó paradisiaca, Tinospora caffra, Vitus, Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii, Rhigiocarya racemifera, and Tiliacora. The larvae feed on Menispermaceae species, including Tinospora smilacina and Legnephora moorei. It is considered a pest on citrus and other fruit, which it damages by piercing the fruit with its proboscis in order to suck the juice.

After working four fifteen years with Red Saunders (1945‚Äì1960), Cohn went on to spend another twenty four years in Count Basie's trumpet section (1960‚Äì1984). Life and career Cohn was born in Chicago, Illinois. Cohn started playing in small groups around the city with King Fleming while he was still a teenager. Campbell, Robert L.; Pruter, Robert and B√ºttner, Armin \\"King Fleming Discography\\" Cohn joined Red Saunders' group in 1945, while Saunders was out of the Club DeLisa and working with a sextet instead of his usual mid- sized band. After his stint in the military, Cohn joined the Saunders group at the Capitol Lounge in Chicago; Leon Washington had recommended him. Cohn was featured on Saunders' first recordings as a leader, for Savoy, Sultan, and (behind Big Joe Turner) on National. Cohn was heard on the records that Saunders made for OKeh Records beginning in 1951 through 1953. After those records, Cohn was on Saunders' recordings for Parrot and Blue Lake in 1953 and 1954. Cohn survived several downsizings of the Red Saunders band, as well as the closure of the Club DeLisa, but eventually accepted an offer from Count Basie, with whom he worked from 1960 through 1984. After Basie's death, Cohn returned to Chicago, where he remained active as a musician for another two decades. Health and death Cohn underwent bypass surgery in 2003. Cohn died on November 7, 2006 in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois at the age of 81. His funeral was held on November 11, 2006 and he was buried at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.

It is named after the type site of Tell Hassuna in Iraq. Other sites where Hassuna material has been found include Tell Shemshara.  Description  By around 6000 BC people had moved into the foothills (piedmont) of northernmost Mesopotamia where there was enough rainfall to allow for \\"dry\\" agriculture in some places. These were the first farmers in northernmost Mesopotamia. They made Hassuna-style pottery (cream slip with reddish paint in linear designs). Hassuna people lived in small villages or hamlets ranging from 2 to . At Tell Hassuna, adobe dwellings built around open central courts with fine painted pottery replace earlier levels with crude pottery. Hand axes, sickles, grinding stones, bins, baking ovens and numerous bones of domesticated animals reflect settled agricultural life. Female figurines have been related to worship and jar burials within which food was placed related to belief in afterlife. The relationship of Hassuna pottery to that of Jericho suggests that village culture was becoming widespread. Proto-Hassuna Some Proto-Hassuna sites The site of Umm Dabaghiyah (:de:Umm Dabaghiyah-Sotto-Kultur), in the same area of Iraq, is believed to have the earliest pottery in this region, and is sometimes described as a 'Proto-Hassuna culture' site. Other related sites in the area are Sotto, and Kul Tepe (Iraq). Another pre-Hassuna or proto-Hassuna site in Iraq is Tell Maghzaliyah. More recently, the concept of a very early 'Pre- Proto-Hassuna' pottery tradition has been introduced by some scholars. This has been prompted by more recent discoveries of still earlier pottery traditions. Pre-Proto-Hassuna Pre-Proto-Hassuna refers to the Late Neolithic period in Upper Mesopotamia when the ceramic containers were just being introduced, and the pottery vessels were still very few in number in these early settlements. At that time, the main emphasis was on the pottery with a mineral temper, as opposed to the plant-tempered pottery which came to predominate later. The time frame for this initial Late Neolithic ceramic period was about 7000-6700 BC, and at this time stone vessels and White Ware were still being used in addition to pottery.Reinhard Bernbeck and Olivier Nieuwenhuyse (2013), ESTABLISHED PARADIGMS, CURRENT DISPUTES AND EMERGING THEMES: THE STATE OF RESEARCH ON THE LATE NEOLITHIC IN UPPER MESOPOTAMIA Publications on Archaeology of the Leiden Museum of Archaeology (PALMA), Brepols pub. (Turnhout, Belgium), 17-37 Because of the narrow local emphasis in many pottery studies as of now, these earliest pottery traditions may be known in literature as, *Pre-Proto-Hassuna (in Khabur, and northern Iraq) *Initial Pottery Neolithic (in Balikh River area, for example Tell Sabi Abyad)The very oldest pottery of Tell Sabi Abyad (and of Syria), 7000-6700 BC http://www.sabi-abyad.nl *Transitional (in Turkish Euphrates area; main sites are Mezraa Teleilat and Akarcay Tepe, with pottery dated to c. 6800 BC) *Halula I (in Syrian Euphrates area; the main site is Tell Halula) *Rouj 2a (in Northern Levant); several archaeological sites are located in the Rouj basin, Idlib, Syria).Syro-Japanese Archaeological Investigation - Rouj Basin Project, Syria Nevertheless, all of these nomenclatures may refer to quite similar types of pottery, depending on some specific geographic region of Upper Mesopotamia.

He is a second cousin of former United States vice-president Dick Cheney but differs strongly with his political point of view being a member of the Workers' Party for many years. O'Callaghan was born in County Kerry in 1934. As a youth he became active in the National Athletic & Cultural Association of Ireland (NACAI, now known as Cycling Ireland) and particularly in the sport of cycling. In 1956 he won the Irish Cycling Championship taking the 100mile TT in 1956 with a time of 4 hours and 27 minutes.http://killorglincycling.com/index.php?page=club- history In more recent years he has been involved with the FBD R√°s cycling competition. At the time one of the NACAI's most prominent members and a national cycling champion was Dublin born Joe Christle who was also an active member of the Irish Republican Army. Under Christle's influence O'Callaghan joined the Irish republican movement however he remained a member when Christle was dismissed from the movement in the mid-1950s for taking unofficial action against British forces in Northern Ireland. Paddy O'Callaghan became a member of the Ard Comhairle (national executive) of Sinn F√©in in the early 1960s and was close to the leadership of President Tom√°s Mac Giolla and IRA Chief of Staff Cathal Goulding. When the movement split in 1969/70 O'Callaghan remained loyal to the Goulding leadership and was influential in swaying the majority of his South Kerry comrades in the IRA and Sinn F√©in to remain in the movement. He was also very active in local community development issues in the South Kerry area and was a founding member of both Killorglin Credit Union and Kerry Mountain Rescue. In the 1967 local elections O'Callaghan was elected for Sinn F√©in in the Killorglin ward. In the early 1970s O'Callaghan was elected to Kerry County Council representing Official Sinn F√©in. He also contested a number of general elections in the Kerry South constituency and was a substitute candidate under the list system for the party in a number of elections to the European Parliament. For many years he also operated a bicycle sale and hire shop in Killarney. O'Callaghan remains active as an adjudicator and commentator in cycling and as a member South Kerry Development Partnership and several other initiatives.

The zenith angle at the IPP is z' and the signal arrives at the receiver with zenith angle z. Here R is the mean Earth radius, H is the mean height of the ionosphere shell. Most global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are subjected to errors induced by the ionosphere. Because ionospheric delay affects the speed of microwave signals differently depending on their frequency‚Äîa characteristic known as dispersion, delays measured on two or more frequency bands can be used to measure dispersion, and this measurement can then be used to estimate the delay at each frequency. The principal source of the dispersion comes from the total electron content (TEC) in the ionosphere, along the line of sight from the satellite to the receiver. Because it is difficult to measure the TEC along the line of sight, instead a prediction can be made using a simplified model of the ionosphere. This model assumes that the ionosphere is a thin, uniform-density shell about the earth, located near the mean altitude H of maximum TEC (approx. 350 km). Using geometry, a slant intersection with this shell model can be determined and a vertical TEC measurement inferred. The intersection between line of sight and this shell is called the ionospheric pierce point (IPP). The perpendicular projection onto the earth's surface is called the subionospheric point.

Antonio Puj√≠a (11 June 1929http://antoniopujia.com/biografia.php?lang=0#.Wwzg3DSFOM8 ‚Äì 26 May 2018)https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2138414-muere-el-escultor-antonio- pujia was an Argentine sculptor. Through his artwork he has always honored women, but he has also denounced the world¬¥s horrors of famine and war. Personal life  Antonio Puj√≠a was born in Polia, a small town in Calabria, Southern Italy, on June 11, 1929. In May 1937 he emigrated with his mother and older sister Carmela to Argentina, where his father Vittorio (who had traveled when Antonio was only two years old) was expecting them. Since his early childhood (and because his difficulty with the Spanish language) he began to draw elements of reality that will attract his attention by the novelty meant for. Upon graduation, the teacher guides students in their future education and tells Puj√≠a that he should follow Fine Arts. He has a son from his first marriage: Vittorio Pujia, a musician who lives in France. In 1960 he joined for love Susana Nicolai (a Psychologist and Ceramist) his lifelong partner, with whom he has two children: Lino Puj√≠a (an Argentine filmmaker) and Sandro Puj√≠a (an Argentine photographer).  Education  Puj√≠a began attending the Buenos Aires's numerous studios in 1943, developing an interest in painting and sculpture. One of his early mentors was the realist sculptor Rogelio Yrurtia. He obtained a MFA in Sculpture, from the National College of Fine Arts Ernesto de la C√°rcova (1954). He also earned a degree as a Professor of Sculpture from the National School of Fine Arts Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n (1950) and a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts (Drawing) from the School of Fine Arts Manuel Belgrano (1946).  Artistic life  = Col√≥n Theatre: 1956‚Äì1970 = In 1956 Pujia won a competition to be the head of newly created Scenic Sculpture Workshop Department at the Col√≥n Theatre, continuing working as director until 1970. From this period comes his fascination with music and dance, two of his favorite subjects. Regularly attends the dancers classes and take endless notes on charcoal on paper. Puj√≠a was close to a number of the opera house's ballet company dancers, and he created a bust of Norma Fontenla (on display at the theatre's foyer). He established his own atelier, and left his post at the Col√≥n Theatre in 1970 to teach at his studio, full-time. = Jewelry and Mini Sculptures: 1970‚Äì2018 = Although he does not considered himself a jeweler, the jewelry of Antonio Puj√≠a were, during the 70s, emblem of what is now called designer jewelry. He is one of the artist's most devoted to jewelry in Argentina, carrying his sculptures to small scale using the bee wax technique. His themes are women, couples, children, dancers. An opening in \\"Art Gallery\\" coincided with the birthday of his wife. \\"I asked her what gift she wanted and she told me a gem\\" -says the artist. I made a breastplate with several figures moving perfectly articulated and taking back with a hook. At the opening in the gallery, especially women, did nothing more than ask me for the jewel. Because of that, I had a lot of proposals of orders to make rings, etc. So, that was the way I started in the artistic jewelry. Antonio Puj√≠a turns to the privacy of the goldsmith work in small pieces conquered by its lyrics, by the quiet, yet nervous cadence that presided, by the fineness of detail and the sweetness of the effects, the continuation of a lineage familiar to magic, illusion, the brief, poignant, concise poem. = ¬øBiafra?: 1971 = This series of sculptures in reference to the Nigerian Civil War or otherwise known as \\"Biafra War\\", displayed a departure in his style, which began to dramatize social and global problems. ¬øBiafra? has its sad moment of inspiration in hunger and death that ravage that area of Africa, although it is obvious from the title itself to these scourges re probation anywhere. Puj√≠a said: these works are a reflection of the scourge of hunger, I focused on the Biafran guys, but the meaning was wider... because I think that a scourge of this kind is the most unfair thing that we humans can make, with the hunger of our children who are totally helpless and dependent on us. A casual observation of a photograph of a child in Biafra was triggering the theme of this Puj√≠a¬¥s work. The search for a categorically own image emerged as something long matured, hurt by the painful stimulus. The series of bronze and other materials which the author called ¬øBiafra? is among the most valuable of Argentina sculpture of all time. = Love Series: 1968‚Äì2018 = With clay, plaster, bronze or marble carving, Puj√≠a exalted the love of the couple since the sixties. The human couple is for him \\"Column of Life\\" name given to his sculpture of Carrara marble carving of more than two meters. I believe in the forces of love. Perhaps because love is the pendulum opposite of the calamities. If we think of aggression, destruction, death, torture exerted by humans to humans, if we think of all that, the love, the couple are just the opposite. Humans have always sailed at infinity, jumping between these two poles: the repulsion and attraction. The destruction and love. Crime and pregnancy. Love is. Even if it last a day, or last fifty years Love is- says Puj√≠a. In the Love Series, men and women have, like in reality, front and back, desires of fusion or moments of loneliness. Pujia starts in a bold way, the variety of materials, the precious mobility obtained with simple rotary- bases procedures, neatly assembled surfaces ‚Äì make of his couples that love each other, a mutable and rich world. The theme of love takes precedence in several respects. Love in the human couple is sublimation in search of integration and unity. The couple is not complemented by binding but in essence is unity, ie eternity. In some of his works man and woman are not embracing each other, or do not face each in its entirety, but the only figure is given by half man, half woman, to give one form as the result: the human being is made, integrated that way. So overcome loneliness, in symbiosis with blood and soul and reaches integrity because it feeds on infinity. In the sculpture \\"Man - Woman\\" (1996), the artist Antonio Puj√≠a has incorporated some Cubist winks in the arrangement of splitting. By mixing these elements, it has continued with the Cubist ideology \\"show what you know, not just what you see.\\" Hips backwards and heads rotated are the most notorious elements that refer to this artistic ism. In the sculpture \\"Man - Woman\\" has been played by the union of two figures, a supposedly female and the other male, which is only recognizable as such by the exhibition of his member. By unifying these two entities into one volumetric construction, the artist wanted to represent a partner concept political present in most of his art exhibitions: gender equality. = Designed medals: 1971‚Äì2010 = Beginning in 1971, Antonio Puj√≠a has created several artistic medals to commemorate private and national events, as well as to reward renowned people. A medal is, strictly speaking, a small, flat, and round (at times, ovoid) piece of metal that has been sculpted, molded, cast, struck, stamped, or some way marked with an insignia, portrait, or other artistic rendering. A medal may be awarded to a person or organization as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, academic, or various other achievements. An artist who creates medals or medallions is called a \\"medallist\\" (UK) or \\"medalist\\" (US). * 1971:Grand Prize SADAIC (Argentina Association of Authors and Composers). * 1978: TV award of the Argentine Chamber of Television. * 1979: SADAIC Awards Medal to authorial right. * 1980: Plaque commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Colon Theatre. * 1980: Medal and Trophy for Clar√≠n. * 1980: Medal commemorating the First Centenary of the Jockey Club of Buenos Aires. * 1980: Medal to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Buenos Aires City. * 1983: Medal to celebrate Argentina¬¥s return to democracy with the inauguration of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. * 1992: Trophies for Techno Entrepreneurs by the Argentine Credit Bank. * 1993: Trophy Award for ARCOR Company. * 1993: SADAIC homage to Atahualpa Yupanqui. * 1993: Moon, Grand National Endowment for the Arts Award. * 1994: Trophy for the opening of the Avenue Theater, and sculpture located in the bearing. * 1995: Trophy Love Duo by SADAIC. * 2010: \\"In union and freedom\\" Bicentennial Medal of the May Revolution. His 1975 exhibit at the San Mart√≠n Cultural Center was a particular success, and Puj√≠a added his entire warehouse of works to the initial display. He lived in Spain from 1975 to 1976, working in the renowned Escorial Museum. Among his most successful later series was that of his \\"Homage to the Woman,\\" which he began in 2004. Suspending his teaching activities, he devoted subsequent years to developing the project.Antonio Puj√≠a: biography  Academic life  In the early years of study he didn't even dreamed of becoming a teacher. I wanted to learn from my teachers, Fioravanti, Bigatti, Troiano Troiani, and then worked in their studios for a living. Teaching comes in 1949, when I won a prize in the Students and Alumni Association of Fine Arts (MEEBA) and its president called me to give classes. 'Not at all, I did not finish the Pueyrred√≥n' I remember I answered. I resisted a little, and offered me to test a month. Then was born that kind of passion aroused by the teaching, which is a form of learning. For several decades he taught sculpture in the National College of Fine Arts Ernesto de la C√°rcova, in the National School of Fine Arts Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n and in the School of Fine Arts Manuel Belgrano. He was invited every year to give a lecture at UNA (National University of the Arts), in a cycle of \\"Talks with Leading Exponents of Visual Arts\\". For many years and currently, Pujia dictates Seminars on Modeling in Beeswax, in his studio in Floresta neighborhood. The course focuses on the ancient technique of using beeswax sculpture and the diversity of its use: both, as a raw material to keep the pieces in wax and its application to the famous \\"lost wax casting\\" for parts both large and small pieces of jewelry to format.

Life He was son of Arthur Mangey, a goldsmith of Leeds, and was educated at the Leeds free school. He was admitted as subsizar to St. John's College, Cambridge, 28 June 1704, at the age of sixteen. He graduated B.A. in 1707 and M.A. in 1711, and was admitted a fellow of St. John's 5 April 1715. In 1716 he is described on the title-page of one of his sermons as chaplain at Whitehall. In 1718 he resigned his fellowship. In 1719 or earlier he was chaplain to the Bishop of London, John Robinson . In 1719 he also proceeded LL.D., and in July 1725 D.D., being one of the seven who then received their doctorate at the hands of Richard Bentley. As deputy to William Lupton, preacher of Lincoln's Inn (who died in December 1726), he delivered a series of discourses on the Lord's Prayer, of which a second edition appeared in 1717. From 1717 to 1720 he was the Rector of St. Nicolas' Church, Guildford, and subsequently the vicarage of Ealing, Middlesex, which he resigned in 1754, and the rectory of St. Mildred's, Bread Street, which he retained till his death. In May 1721 he was presented to the fifth stall in Durham Cathedral, and promoted from that to the first in January 1722. Mangey died at Durham, 6 March 1755, and was buried in the east transept of the cathedral. Works His major work was his edition of Philo of Alexandria (Philo Judaeus), Philonis Judaei Opera . . . typis Gulielmi Bowyer, 2 vols. London, 1742. He also made collations of the text of the Greek Testament, and critical notes and adversaria on Diodorus Siculus and other classical authors. His other printed works are mainly sermons, and polemical treatises against John Toland and William Whiston. One volume of collected sermons by him was published in 1732. His 'Remarks upon \\"Nazarenus,\\" wherein the Falsity of Mr. Toland's Mahometan Gospel. &c.;, are set forth,' 1719, called forth more than one answer. Toland replied to it the year after in his Tetradymus. Another of his treatises, Plain Notions of our Lord's Divinity, also published in 1719, was answered the same year by 'Phileleutherus Cantabrigiensis,' i.e. Thomas Herne. Family He married Dorothy, daughter of John Sharpe, archbishop of York, by whom he left a son, John, afterwards vicar of Dunmow, Essex, and prebendary of St. Paul's, who died in 1782.

Indian Railways, New Delhi: National Book Trust, pp.217‚Äì28 History To enforce standardization and co-ordination between various railway systems in British India, the Indian Railway Conference Association (IRCA) was set up in 1903. It was followed by the establishment of the Central Standards Office (CSO) in 1930, for preparation of designs, standards and specifications. However, till independence in 1947, most of the designs and manufacture of railway equipment was entrusted to foreign consultants. After independence, a new organisation called Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC) was set up in 1952 at Lucknow, for undertaking the intensive investigation of railway problems, providing basic criteria and new concepts for design purposes, for testing prototypes and generally assisting in finding solutions for specific problems. In 1957, the Central Standards Office (CSO) and the Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC) were integrated into a single unit named Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) under the Ministry of Railways with its headquarters at Manak Nagar, Lucknow. The status of RDSO was changed from an \\"Attached Office\\" to a \\"Zonal Railway\\" on 1 January 2003, to give it greater flexibility and a boost to the research and development activities. Organisation The RDSO is headed by a Director-General who ranks as a general manager of a Zonal Railway.

Biography  Dmitriev was born on August 28, 1898 in Moscow, in a professional family. In 1916, after graduating with a gold medal the 3rd Moscow gymnasium, he joined the Historical- Philological faculty of the Moscow University, and in 1918 he entered in parallel Lazarev Near Eastern Institute (former Lazarev Oriental Languages Institute). In 1920. Dmitriev graduated from the Moscow University, and in 1922 Near Eastern Institute (renamed to Oriental Studies Institute) in three majors, Turkish, Persian and Arabic. Dmitriev also studied in depth Classical languages, Serbian, Bulgarian, modern Greek, Armenian, Romanian, Arabic, Persian, Pehlevi, Syrian, Turkish, Tatar, Bashkir and Kazakh, in addition to the main European languages (French, German, English and Italian. Dmitriev was also engaged in Slavic philology and then Turkology.  Information  Dmitriev's linguistic views formed under influence of school of F.W.Radloff, continued by P.M.Melioransky. The range of Dmitriev scientific interests was very wide. It developed right at the beginning of his career, when the scientist almost simultaneously started to work on Turkish, Tatar, Bashkir, Gagauz, Kumyk, Azeri, Turkmen, and other languages of the extensive Turkic family that soon became a subject of his specialty. Dmitriev was a convinced supporter of the theory that stipulates a genetic unity of the Turkic languages. That led to the comparative and comparative-historical methods as the main tool in studies of the structure of Turkic languages; and to the synthetic approach to the problems of Turkology, which explain the overall unity of his thematically various research on the languages of Turkic group. Dmitriev took a primarily historical view of the linguistic phenomena. He was an expert on morphology, syntax, phonetics, lexicology, dialectology, and history of the Turkic languages. When the ideas by N.Ya. Marr began being strenuously propagandized in the Stalinist Soviet Union, Dmitriev remained alien to the attempts to discover in Turkic languages \\"stadial reorganizations\\", and to the attempts to discover in Turkic languages inflection, prefixes, etc., which did not escape even some competent foreign Turkologists. He initiated a push against some errors that at times prevented a correct understanding of the phenomena typical for Turkic languages. After F.W. Radloff and V.A. Bogoroditsky, Dmitriev suggested a new, more specific definition and formulated relationship of palatal and labial vowel synharmonism, pointing to the subordinated character of the labial articulation. His position about phonetic variability of the root in the Turkic languages was an important development that corrected an existing postulate in Turkology according to which a root in the Turkic languages is unchangeable. A prominent place in the Dmitriev's works held the questions of lexicology. A special place in the Dmitriev's scientific biography addresses the problem of the T√ºrko-Slavic linguistic relations. In the problem of the Turkic loans in Slavic languages, and first of all in Russian, Dmitriev's research brought in new dimensions, studying time, conditions and penetration paths of these loans into the Russian and Slavic languages. His brochure Structure of Turkish language expressed in a compressed form his valuable observations about loans in the Turkish vocabulary, historical conditions of their penetration in Turkish language, and the nearest intermediaries that conducted loans from territorially remote languages. The special Slavophonic training received by Dmitriev before his Turkological education allowed him to turn to Slavic languages and Turkic texts in a Slavic transcription as a major source on the history and dialectology of the Turkic, especially southern Turkic languages. His research in this area had even greater value for the Slavic philology, because it complemented studies on the influences of the Turkic languages on Slavic languages. In his last years Dmitriev started publishing his research on the Russian-Turkic language comparisons. In his last years Dmitriev's attention especially attracted the question on attitude of the Turkic languages to the category of grammatical gender. On the material of Azeri language, Dmitriev published a special article on this subject, suggesting a presence of vestiges or hints on the grammatical gender in the modern Turkic languages. Dmitriev wrote baseline scientific descriptions for many of Turkic languages, including Kumyk, Bashkir, Turkmen, and Gagauz. The \\"Grammar of Kumyk language\\" was a first in a Turkology scientific description of this language with general Turkological impact. The Gagauz language for the first time was investigated by Dmitriev, one of his two works is devoted to phonetics, and another gave its grammatical and lexical description. Dmitriev described the strong palatalisation of the Gagauz consonants, and noted morphological, and especially syntactic and lexical features of the Gagauz language that distinguish it from others. This characterization helped to establish its relationship with it southwest group of the Turkic languages. Dmitriev sent two decades' worth of materials he had collected on the Azeri language to be published as a large scientific grammar, but during the Siege of Leningrad it was lost, together with the first edition of the \\"Bashkir language grammar\\". Dmitriev devoted to the Bashkir language a major part of his research, and the best of them, \\"Bashkir language grammar\\", together with his other fundamental works became desktop book of the Turkologists. For comparative purposes Dmitriev also involved other language families, Indo- European (Western European languages, Latin, certainly Russian), Uralic (Hungarian and others) allowing wide linguistic interpretation. Under Dmitriev's editorship was published \\"Russian-Bashkir Dictionary\\" with a grammatical sketch the Bashkir language. Another monumental lexicographic works of Turkology was the \\"Russian-Chuvash dictionary\\" under Dmitriev editorship with a grammatical sketch the Chuvash language. Dmitriev co- authored Khakas grammatical book. Dmitriev was not only a linguist Turkologist, but also an expert on Turkic folklore. He published or co- authored works on Crimean-Tatar, Azeri, Turkmen, and Slavic folklore, and Azeri songs in Armenian transcription. Dmitriev established the Kumyk, Bashkir, Turkmen, Azeri and Chuvash branches of Turkic linguistics. For 16 years (1925‚Äì1941) Dmitriev was closely connected with the Leningrad State University and Oriental Institute, where he headed the faculty of Turkic philology. His energy and efforts led to creation of Oriental Branch at the Philological faculty of the Moscow State University, which he headed till the last days of his life. He also worked to establish methodology of teaching Russian in Turkic schools. During Dmitriev's 30-years pedagogical work he created a large number of university courses, including Turkic paleography. Dmitriev's outstanding achievement was preparation of scientists in the field of Turkology. Under his leadership completed post-graduate work and received post-graduate and doctoral degrees many tens of ethnically Turkic students. The leading Turkological scientists of the central and local linguistic centers are mostly Dmitriev's pupils. His pupils work in Moscow, Leningrad, Baku, Ashkhabad, Alma-Ata, Bishkek, Tashkent, Samarkand, Kazan, Ufa, Makhachkala, Cheboksary, Yakutsk, Abakan and other cities. Among them are members of Academies, Doctors of sciences and professors, prominent figures in culture and education.  Bibliography of N.

The Red Turban rebels, originating in the Zhejiang area, were opposed to the Yuan dynasty of China and the Mongolian plateau. After gaining control of Liaodong, the Red Turbans invaded Goryeo in 1359 and 1360. Background The Mongol invasions of Korea lasted from 1231‚Äì1259, and Goryeo capitulated to the Mongol empire under an agreement of a condition \\"not changing the local custom\\" (‰∏çÊîπÂúüÈ¢®), and became their son-in-law nation (ÈßôÈ¶¨Âúã) in 1270 until 1356. In the mid-14th century, when the Yuan dynasty was beginning to crumble due to the Red Turban Rebellion, Gongmin reformed the Korean government, abolished Mongolian military outposts, purged pro-Yuan sentiments, and regained lost northern territories. The Red Turbans attacked Goryeo most likely because of military exigency. First Red Turban invasion In December 1359, part of the Red Turban army moved their base to the Liaodong Peninsula. However, they were experiencing a shortage of war materials and lost their withdrawal route to Chinese mainland. The Red Turban army led by Mao Ju-jing invaded Goryeo and took the city of Pyongyang. In January 1360, the Goryeo army led by An U and Yi Bang-sil retook Pyongyang and the northern region which had been captured by the enemy. Of the Red Turban army that had crossed the Yalu River, only 300 troops returned to Liaoning after the war. Second Red Turban invasion  In November 1360, the Red Turban troops invaded again Goryeo's northwest border with 200,000 troops and they occupied Gaegyeong, the capital of Goryeo, for a short period, King Gongmin escaped to Andong. However, Generals Choe Yeong, Yi Seonggye (later Taejo of Joseon), Jeong Seun and Yi Bang-sil repulsed the Red Turban army. Sha Liu and Guan Xiansheng, who were Red Turban generals, were killed in the battles. The Goryeo army continually chased their enemy and cleared them from the Korean Peninsula. Aftermath Although Goryeo had repulsed the Red Turbans, both the population and the economy had been severely damaged. Wokou pirates had been troubling the southern peninsula for some time. Generals Choe Yeong and Yi Seong-gye were called upon by King Gongmin to combat them, thereby giving the successful generals much influence and a power base in the country. General Yi Seonggye especially identified himself with the reformist Sinjin faction. In 1388, unwilling to lead the invasion of Liaodong and fight the Ming dynasty, General Yi Seonggye decided to revolt against U of Goryeo and his fellow general, Choe Yeong, and swept back to the capital, Gaegyeong, to secure control of the government. In 1392, General Yi founded Joseon dynasty.

The concept of vacuum genesis was first proposed in 1969 during a seminar being conducted by cosmologist Dennis Sciama. Edward Tryon, in the audience, was seized by an idea and blurted \\"Maybe the universe is a vacuum fluctuation.\\" This was treated as a joke at the time, but Tryon had not been joking. In a 1984 interview, Tryon recalled that three years later, sitting at home, he had a further revelation; \\"I visualized the universe erupting out of nothing as a quantum fluctuation and I realized that it was possible that it explained the critical density of the universe.\\" The critical density of the universe is dependent upon the rate at which the universe is still expanding. The universe is expanding at an accelerated rate, but was originally thought to be slowing down. Furthermore, the rate at which this is changing gives the overall mass density of the universe which is denoted by the Greek letter omega. If omega is less than one, the mass density would be insufficient to stop the universe's expansion and it would go on expanding forever. If omega is more than one, the universe will eventually stop expanding and will thus collapse in on itself to again form another fireball not unlike the one from which it came. If omega is exactly 1, the universe's expansion will continuously slow, but never quite halt. Tryon's theory requires that omega be equal to or less than one. Through calculations it has been found that omega is 1 as far as instruments are able to determine. However, the universe could be so vast that its curvature is undetectable. The universe's rate of expansion is accelerating and is projected to continue accelerating due to dark energy, thus omega must be lower than 1. The concept of vacuum genesis was further promoted by Lawrence M. Krauss in his book A Universe from Nothing, published in 2012. The book contents was deemed to be \\"not supported by modern general relativity theory or quantum field theory\\" in critical paper in 2015.

It is used for grounding /earthing coaxial cables of copper or aluminium on antenna installations for telecommunication (mobile communications). Construction Grounding kits for different diameters Part of a tin-plated ripple Grounding kits / Earthing kits are composed of two main components, a clamp and a cable. The clamp will be screwed on a coaxial cable and in case of lightning strokes in the antenna installation, the voltage will be diverted over a ripple in the clamp with the combined cable and will be earthed / grounded by this way. The clamps of the grounding kits / earthing kits are composed of an ozone- and UV-resistant rubber coat with a device where the ripple can be lodged. The tin-plated ripple with a special alloying enables the bridging over big tolerances between kit and coaxial cable which is important for a best possible voltage transmission. The ripple to the skinned coaxial cable has a low contact resistance between 0.10 and 0.15 mŒ©. It also enables a better length compensation as well as even and low contact pressures, which avoids damages on the coaxial cable. These characteristics are known as relaxation behaviour. Assembly For assembling a grounding kit / earthing kit with integrated cable lug the coaxial cable is skinned, the grounding kit / earthing kit is set and tightened by a screw.

It is his second and most recent novel, the first being And the Ass Saw the Angel, published in 1989. Synopsis The novel deals with Bunny Munro, a middle-aged lothario, whose constant womanising and alcohol abuse comes to a head after his wife's suicide. A travelling door-to-door beauty-product salesman, he and his son go on an increasingly out-of-control road trip around Brighton, over which looms the shadow of a serial killer making his way towards Brighton, as well as Bunny's own mortality. The novel is set in Brighton in 2003, around the time the West Pier was destroyed by fire. Many of the locations and street names used in the book relate to real places close to Cave's own home. Release The novel was also released as an audiobook, using a 3D audio effect, produced and sound-directed by British artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, with a soundtrack by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, and in a number of e-book formats, including an iPhone application that synchronised the audiobook with the text and included exclusive videos of Cave reading. A series of live events took place in late 2009 to promote the book under the title of \\"A Night with Nick Cave\\", combining music, readings and a Q&A; session with the audience. Reception Cave reading from The Death of Bunny Munro in New York City, 2009 Irvine Welsh, Neil Labute and David Peace have all touted the novel, providing back-cover reviews. Moreover, The Death of Bunny Munro has received strong reviews from the British media: Graeme Thomson (writing in The Observer, 6 September 2009) awarded the novel 4 stars out of 5. Likewise, the Saturday Times (on 5 September 2009) stated, in a very positive review, that the novel \\"reads like a good indie movie\\".

In the second half of the 20th century, the national and universal style were merged by the architects Edvard Ravnikar and Marko Mu≈°iƒç. Prehistory and Antiquity Alpine pile house Around 2000 BC, the Ljubljana Marshes in the immediate vicinity of Ljubljana were settled by people living in pile dwellings. Prehistoric pile dwellings and the oldest wooden wheel in the world are among the most notable archeological findings from the marshland. These lake-dwelling people lived through hunting, fishing and primitive agriculture. To get around the marshes, they used dugout canoes made by cutting out the inside of tree trunks. Their archaeological remains, nowadays in the Municipality of Ig, have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site since June 2011, in the common nomination of six Alpine states.

Public electric lighting appeared in the city in 1898. The rebuilding period between 1896 and 1910 is referred to as the \\"revival of Ljubljana\\" because of architectural changes from which a great deal of the city dates back to today and for reform of urban administration, health, education and tourism that followed. The rebuilding and quick modernisation of the city were led by the mayor Ivan Hribar. Together with Ciril Metod Koch and Ivan Vanca≈°, Max Fabiani introduced the Vienna Secession style of architecture (a type of Art Nouveau) in Slovenia.Andrej Hrausky, Janez Ko≈æelj: Maks Fabiani: Dunaj, Ljubljana, Trst., Mladina, 12 August 2010 Max Fabiani's rationalist Mladika Complex, 1906-07 Fabiani's first large-scale architectural project was the urban plan for the Carniolan, now Slovenian capital Ljubljana, which was badly damaged by the April 1895 Ljubljana earthquake. Fabiani won a competition against the more historicist architect Camillo Sitte, and was chosen by the Ljubljana Town Council as the main urban planner. One of the reasons for this choice was Fabiani was considered by the Slovene Liberal Nationalists as a Slovene.Breda Miheliƒç, Urbanistiƒçni razvoj Ljubljane (Ljubljana: Partizanska knjiga, 1983), 10. Second reason was that he knew Ljubljana better than Sitte and prepared really good and modern plan. With the personal sponsorship of the Liberal nationalist mayor of Ljubljana Ivan Hribar, Fabiani designed several important buildings in the town, including the L-shaped school in the Mladika Complex facing Pre≈°eren Street (), which is now the seat of the Slovenian Foreign Ministry. Max Fabiani also designed Pre≈°eren Square as the hub of four streets. In place of the medieval houses which were damaged by the earthquake, a number of palaces were built around it. Between Wolf Street and ƒåop Street stands the Hauptmann House, built in 1873 and renovated in 1904 in the Secessionist style by the architect Ciril Metod Koch. The other palaces include the Frisch House, the Seunig House and the Urbanc House, as well as the Mayer department store, built thirty years later. File:Winter is back!

Following governmental centralization after the 1918 creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, this initial bottom-up enthusiasm began to fade. Yugoslav architecture became more dictated by an increasingly concentrated state authority which sought to establish a unified state identity. In 1919, Ivan Vurnik and Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik founded the Ljubljana School of Architecture. The 1920s decade is associated with the search for a Slovene \\"National Style\\", inspired by Slovene folk art and the Vienna Secession style. The Cooperative Business Bank, designed by Vurnik and his wife Helena Kottler Vurnik who designed the decorative facade in the colors of Slovene tricolor, has been called the most beautiful building in Ljubljana.The Most Beautiful House in Ljubljana (In Slovene: \\"Vurnikova hi≈°a na Miklo≈°iƒçevi: najlep≈°a hi≈°a v Ljubljani\\"), Delo, 8 April 2011Arhitekturno-slikarski dvojec: Ivan Vurnik in Helena Kottler Vurnik (Dokumentarno-igrani film TV Slovenija), MMC RTV Slovenia, 8 February 2013 Beginning with the late 1920s and 1930s, Yugoslav architects including Vurnik and Pleƒçnik began to advocate for architectural modernism and functionalist , viewing the style as the logical extension of progressive national narratives. Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik gave Ljubljana its modern identity by designing iconic buildings such as the Slovene National and University Library building. He also designed other notable buildings, including the Vzajemna Insurance Company Offices, and contributed to many civic improvements. He renovated the city's bridges and the Ljubljanica banks, and designed the Ljubljana Central Market and the ≈Ωale cemetery. Socialist Yugoslav period Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik's unrealized plan for the Slovenian parliament (1947) Spomenik) on Freedom Hill, Ilirska Bistrica, 1965Spomenik Database The architecture of Yugoslavia was characterized by emerging, unique, and often differing national and regional narratives. As a socialist state remaining free from the Iron Curtain, Yugoslavia adopted a hybrid identity that combined the architectural, cultural, and political leanings of both Western liberal democracy and Soviet communism. Immediately following the Second World War, Yugoslavia's brief association with the Eastern Bloc ushered in a short period of socialist realism. Centralization within the communist model led to the abolishment of private architectural practices and the state control of the profession. During this period, the governing Communist Party condemned modernism as \\"bourgeois formalism,\\" a move that caused friction among the nation's pre-war modernist architectural elite. Despite being a fervent Catholic, in 1947 Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik was invited to design a new Parliament building. Pleƒçnik proposed the Cathedral of Freedom where he wanted to raze the Ljubljana Castle and to build a monumental octagonal building instead. The unrealized Pleƒçnik Parliament is featured on the Slovene 10 cent euro coin Socialist realist architecture in Yugoslavia came to an abrupt end with Josip Broz Tito's 1948 split with Stalin. In the following years the nation turned increasingly to the West, returning to the modernism that had characterized pre-war Yugoslav architecture. During this era, modernist architecture came to symbolize the nation's break from the USSR (a notion that later diminished with growing acceptability of modernism in the Eastern Bloc). During this period, the Yugoslav break from Soviet socialist realism combined with efforts to commemorate World War II, which together led to the creation of an immense quantity of abstract sculptural war memorials, known today as spomenik In the late 1950s and early 1960s Brutalism began to garner a following within Yugoslavia, particularly among younger architects, a trend possibly influenced by the 1959 disbandment of the Congr√®s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne. With 1950s decentralization and liberalization policies in SFR Yugoslavia, architecture became increasingly fractured along ethnic lines. Architects increasingly focused on building with reference to the architectural heritage of their individual socialist republics in the form of critical regionalism. Growing distinction of individual ethnic architectural identities within Yugoslavia was exacerbated with the 1972 decentralization of the formerly centralized historical preservation authority, providing individual regions further opportunity to critically analyze their own cultural narratives. The next generation of Slovenian architects was led by Novo Mesto-born Edvard Ravnikar, student of Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik.Modern and contemporary Slovene architecture. www.culturalprofiles.org.uk 2007 (Archived by WebCite¬Æ) Ravnikar, a professor at the Ljubljana School of Architecture, promoted Scandinavian architectural style in Slovenia, particularly Finnish achievements in architecture accomplished by those such as Alvar Aalto. His most notable creations feature prominently in Ljubljana, among them Republic Square, Cankar Hall, Maximarket department store, and the Museum of Modern Art. Contemporary period Teharje Memorial Park, by Marko Mu≈°iƒç, 2004 The international style, which had arrived in Yugoslavia already in the 1980s, took over the scene after the independence.

European Workshop on Applications and Theory of Petri Nets 1986: 293-308 were invented by Jacques Vautherin in 1985 in his PhD thesis and later improved by Wolfang Reisig.Wolfgang Reisig: Petri Nets and Algebraic Specifications. Theor. Comput. Sci. 80(1): 1-34 (1991) The formalism has two aspects : * The control part which is handled by a Petri net. * The data part which is handled by one or many AADTs. AADT can be themselves split in two parts: * The signature (Sort and Ops in the example below) which gives the valid constants and operations of the term algebra. * The axiomatization (Axioms in the example below) which gives the semantics of the operations described in the signature part. The following picture describes an algebraic Petri net model of the \\"dining philosophers problem\\". There are two AADT in this model, one for the forks algebra, one for the philosophers algebra. Please note that the philosophers AADT uses the fork AADT. Since all philosophers can take their left fork without taking their right fork, executing this model can result in a deadlock. The control part is composed of : *Places contain multiset (bags) of tokens. Those tokens are elements of a term algebra built upon the signature of the AADT (in the example, terms that represent either a philosopher or a fork). Each place contains one and only one multiset of terms, the place is typed by its multiset. *Arcs can be labeled with multisets of either closed or free terms. Again terms are built from the AADT signature. *Transitions are events that can be fired whenever there are enough resources (namely enough tokens in the input places to satisfy all the input arcs) and the guard (firing conditions) of the transition holds. Then the produced tokens are put in the target places of the output arcs. Usually term rewritingDick, A. J. and Watson, P. 1991. Order-sorted term rewriting. Comput. J. 34, 1 (Feb. 1991), 16-19. is used for the operational semantics in order to check if conditions hold and to compute output terms.

Treatments also extend to survivorship based interventions. These interventions are focused on five domains including: physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, surveillance, health promotion and care coordination.. However, a published review has found only high levels of evidence for interventions that target physical and psychological symptom management and health promotion, with no reviews of interventions for either care coordination or surveillance.. The favored treatment option depends on the stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors include the man's age, his general health, and his feelings about potential treatments and their possible side-effects. Because all treatments can have significant side-effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations. The selection of treatment options may involve complex decisions with many factors. For example, radical prostatectomy after primary radiation failure, a very technically challenging surgical operation, may not be an option. This may enter into the treatment decision. If the cancer has spread beyond the prostate, treatment options change significantly, so most doctors who treat prostate cancer use a variety of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, HIFU, external-beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Clinicians may reserve hormonal therapy and chemotherapy for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: radiation therapy can treat some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy some early-stage tumors. Doctors may also propose cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses. Active surveillance Active surveillance is observation and regular monitoring without invasive treatment. In the context of prostate disease this usually comprises regular PSA blood tests and prostate biopsies. Active surveillance is often used when an early stage, slow-growing prostate cancer is suspected. However, watchful waiting may also be suggested when the risks of surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy outweigh the possible benefits. Other treatments can be started if symptoms develop, or if there are signs that the cancer growth is accelerating . Approximately one-third of men who choose active surveillance for early stage tumors eventually have signs of tumor progression, and they may need to begin treatment within three years. Men that choose active surveillance avoid the risks of surgery, radiation, and other treatments. The risk of disease progression and metastasis (spread of the cancer) may be increased, but this increase risk appears to be small if the program of surveillance is followed closely, generally including serial PSA assessments and repeat prostate biopsies every 1‚Äì2 years depending on the PSA trends. Study results in 2011 suggest active surveillance is the best choice for older 'low-risk' patients.http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/041911/page2 Active Surveillance May Be Preferred Option in Some Men with Prostate Cancer Surgery Surgical removal of the prostate, or prostatectomy, is a common treatment either for early stage prostate cancer or for cancer that has failed to respond to radiation therapy. The most common type is radical retropubic prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an abdominal incision. Another type is radical perineal prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an incision in the perineum, the skin between the scrotum and anus. Radical prostatectomy can also be performed laparoscopically, through a series of small (1 cm) incisions in the abdomen, with or without the assistance of a surgical robot. =Radical prostatectomy= Radical prostatectomy is effective for tumors that have not spread beyond the prostate; cure rates depend on risk factors such as PSA level and Gleason grade. However, it may cause nerve damage that may significantly alter the quality of life of the prostate cancer survivor. Radical prostatectomy has been associated with a greater decrease in sexual function and increased urinary incontinence (mainly stress incontinence) than external beam radiotherapy, an alternative treatment. Radical prostatectomy has traditionally been used alone when the cancer is localized to the prostate. In the event of positive margins or locally advanced disease found on pathology, adjuvant radiation therapy may offer improved survival. Surgery may also be offered when a cancer is not responding to radiation therapy. However, because radiation therapy causes tissue changes, prostatectomy after radiation has higher risks of complications.  Laparoscopic approach  Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, LRP, is a new way to approach the prostate surgically with intent to cure. Contrasted with the open surgical form of prostate cancer surgery, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy requires a smaller incision. Relying on modern technology, such as miniaturization, fiber optics, and the like, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a minimally invasive prostate cancer treatment but is technically demanding and seldom done in the USA.  Robotic assistance  Some believe that in the hands of an experienced surgeon, robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) may reduce positive surgical margins when compared to radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) among patients with prostate cancer according to a retrospective study. The relative risk reduction was 57.7%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study (35.5% of patients had positive surgical margins following RRP), this leads to an absolute risk reduction of 20.5%. 4.9 patients must be treated for one to benefit (number needed to treat = 4.9). Other recent studies have shown RALP to result in a significantly higher rate of positive margins. Other studies showed no difference of robotic to open surgery. The relative merits of RALP and potential benefit versus open radical prostatectomy is currently an area of intense research and debate in urology. The only proven and accepted advantage to RALP is less intraoperative blood loss. Other suggested advantages beyond this lack definitive data and have not been widely accepted by the broader urological community. =Transurethral resection= Transurethral resection of the prostate, commonly called a \\"TURP,\\" is a surgical procedure performed when the tube from the bladder to the penis (urethra) is blocked by prostate enlargement. In general, TURP is done for benign prostatic hyperplasia and is not meant as definitive treatment for prostate cancer. During a TURP, a small instrument (cystoscope) is placed into the penis and the blocking prostate is cut away by cautery. =Cryosurgery= Cryosurgery is another method of treating prostate cancer in which the prostate gland is exposed to freezing temperatures.PreventProstateCancer.info: A Brief Overview of Prostate Cancer Cryosurgery is less invasive than radical prostatectomy, and general anesthesia is less commonly used. Under ultrasound guidance, a method invented by Dr. Gary Onik, metal rods are inserted through the skin of the perineum into the prostate. Highly purified argon gas is used to cool the rods, freezing the surrounding tissue at ‚àí186 ¬∞C (‚àí302 ¬∞F). As the water within the prostate cells freezes, the cells die. The urethra is protected from freezing by a catheter filled with warm liquid. Impotence occurs up to ninety percent of the time. =Surgical removal of the testicles= In metastatic disease, where cancer has spread beyond the prostate, removal of the testicles (called orchiectomy) may be done to decrease testosterone levels and control cancer growth. (See hormonal therapy, below). =Complications of surgery= The most common serious complications of surgery are loss of urinary control and impotence. Reported rates of both complications vary widely depending on how they are assessed, by whom, and how long after surgery, as well as the setting (e.g., academic series vs. community-based or population-based data).  Erectile Dysfunction  Although penile sensation and the ability to achieve orgasm usually remain intact, erection and ejaculation are often impaired. Medications such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil (Levitra) may restore some degree of potency. For most men with organ-confined disease, a more limited \\"nerve-sparing\\" technique may help reduce urinary incontinence and impotence.  Urinary Incontinence  Radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and radiation therapy are the main causes of stress incontinence in men, with radical prostatectomy being the top cause . In most cases, the incontinence resolves within 12 months with conservative treatment. Multiple factors, such as injury of the urethral sphincter or nervous bundles can play a role, causing mostly stress incontinence . Stress urinary incontinence happens when the urethral sphincter (the muscular sphincter that closes the bladder) fails to properly close, leading to leakage of urine in situations where the abdominal pressure is higher than usual, such as when laughing, sneezing, or coughing. Conservative treatment, such as pelvic floor muscle training (Kegel exercise) has been prescribed to improve urinary continence, the evidence for efficacy in men after radical prostatectomy has come into question recently. According to information from the Men After Prostate Surgery (MAPS) randomized control trial, pelvic floor muscle training was not shown to be therapeutic or cost effective in improving urinary continence. Other therapies include the use of penile clamps, transurethral bulking agents, and catheters, however, the most commonly used surgical therapies performed are the placement of a urethral sling or artificial urinary sphincter . In patients with moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence after prostate surgery, artificial urinary sphincter is the treatment of choice, after all the other conservative measures fail . Radiation therapy Radiation therapy, also known as radiotherapy, is often used to treat all stages of prostate cancer. It is also often used after surgery if the surgery was not successful at curing the cancer. Radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation to kill prostate cancer cells. When absorbed in tissue, ionizing radiation such as gamma and x-rays damage the DNA in cancer cells, which increases the probability of apoptosis (cell death). Normal cells are able to repair radiation damage, while cancer cells are not. Radiation therapy exploits this fact to treat cancer. Two different kinds of radiation therapy are used in prostate cancer treatment: external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy (specifically prostate brachytherapy). =External beam radiation therapy= External beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer is delivered by a linear accelerator, such as this one. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses a linear accelerator to produce high-energy x-rays that are directed in a beam towards the prostate. A technique called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) may be used to adjust the radiation beam to conform with the shape of the tumor, allowing higher doses to be given to the prostate and seminal vesicles with less damage to the bladder and rectum. External beam radiation therapy is generally given over several weeks, with daily visits to a radiation therapy center. New types of radiation therapy such as IMRT have fewer side effects than traditional treatment. However, in the short term, EBRT has been associated with acute worsening of urinary obstructive and bowel symptoms. These symptoms have been shown to decline over time. Eleven centers in the United States are now using proton therapy for prostate cancer, which uses protons rather than X-rays to kill the cancer cells. Researchers are also studying types of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer. =Brachytherapy= Permanent implant brachytherapy is a popular treatment choice for patients with low to intermediate risk features, can be performed on an outpatient basis, and is associated with good 10-year outcomes with relatively low morbidity. It involves the placement of about 100 small \\"seeds\\" containing radioactive material (such as iodine-125 or palladium-103) with a needle through the skin of the perineum directly into the tumor while under spinal or general anesthetic. These seeds emit lower-energy X-rays which are only able to travel a short distance. Although the seeds eventually become inert, they remain in the prostate permanently. The risk of exposure to others from men with implanted seeds is generally accepted to be insignificant. Review. However, men are encouraged to talk to their doctors about any special temporary precautions around small children and pregnant women. =Uses= Radiation therapy is commonly used in prostate cancer treatment. It may be used instead of surgery or after surgery in early stage prostate cancer (adjuvant radiotherapy). Radiation treatments also can be combined with hormonal therapy for intermediate risk disease, when surgery or radiation therapy alone is less likely to cure the cancer. Some radiation oncologists combine external beam radiation and brachytherapy for intermediate to high-risk situations. Radiation therapy is often used in conjunction with hormone therapy for high- risk patients. Others use a \\"triple modality\\" combination of external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and hormonal therapy. In advanced stages of prostate cancer, radiation is used to treat painful bone metastases or reduce spinal cord compression. Radiation therapy is also used after radical prostatectomy either for cancer recurrence or if multiple risk factors are found during surgery. Radiation therapy delivered immediately after surgery when risk factors are present (positive surgical margin, extracapsular extension, seminal vessicle involvement) has been demonstrated to reduce cancer recurrence, decrease distant metastasis, and increase overall survival in two separate randomized trials. =Side effects= Side effects of radiation therapy might occur after a few weeks into treatment. Both types of radiation therapy may cause diarrhea and mild rectal bleeding due to radiation proctitis, as well as potential urinary incontinence and impotence. Symptoms tend to improve over time except erections which typically worsen as time progresses. A new method to reduce rectal radiation injury in prostate cancer patients involves the use of an absorbable spacer placed between the prostate and rectum. MRI showing hydrogel spacer pushing the rectum away from the prostate during radiotherapy. Such spacers are commercially available in some regions, and are undergoing clinical trials in others. By temporarily altering the anatomy these products have the potential to allow for improved cancer targeting while minimizing risk to neighboring healthy tissues. Prostate Rectum Spacers should be compatible with all prostate cancer radiotherapy treatments including 3D conformal, IMRT and stereotactic radiation and brachytherapy. =Comparison to surgery= Multiple retrospective analyses have demonstrated that overall survival and disease-free survival outcomes are similar between radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy. However, a recent retrospective study suggests that men under 60 with high grade prostate cancer have higher survival rates with surgery than with beam radiation. Rates for impotence when comparing radiation to nerve-sparing surgery are similar. Radiation has lower rates of incontinence compared with surgery, but has higher rates of occasional mild rectal bleeding. Men who have undergone external beam radiation therapy may have a slightly higher risk of later developing colon cancer and bladder cancer. Since prostate cancer is generally a multifocal disease, the traditional prostatectomy eliminates all local lesions by removing the entire prostate. However, it has been hypothesized that an \\"index lesion\\" might be responsible for disease progression. Therefore, focal therapy targeted towards the index lesion might effectively treat prostate cancer while preserving the remainder of the gland. Interventional radiologists have started to treat prostate cancer with minimally invasive therapies such as cryoablation, HIFU, radiofrequency ablation, and photodynamic therapy that permit focal therapy by utilizing image guidance. These therapies are still in beginning or experimental stages; however, because they preserve tissue, they can potentially reduce adverse treatment outcomes such as impotence and incontinence. A small prospective study published in European Urology in February 2015 assessed the focal treatment of index lesions with HIFU in patients with multifocal prostate cancer and found that the majority of men returned to baseline genitourinary function and 86% of men were free of clinically significant prostate cancer at one year. Small, nonrandomized cohort studies with a median range follow-up 17‚Äì47 months have shown that cryoablation, HIFU, and phototherapy are associated with low rates of adverse effects and early disease control rates of 83%-100% based on negative biopsies. Patients who might particularly benefit from focal therapy with HIFU are men with recurrent cancer after the gland has been removed. Cancer recurrence rates after surgical resection can be as high as 15-20%. MR imaging improves early detection of cancer, so MR-guided therapies can be applied to treat recurrent disease. Additionally, for men who have already failed salvage radiation treatment and have limited therapeutic options remaining, interventional therapies might offer more chances to potentially cure their disease. While recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of these treatments, additional work is needed to further evaluate which patients are best suited for these procedures and determine long-term efficacy. High intensity focused ultrasound High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain, prostate, spleen, liver, kidney, breast, and bone. HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes ultrasound to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue, thus destroying the cancerous cells. In essence, ultrasonic waves are focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer, with minimal risks of affecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100 ¬∞C (212 ¬∞F). However, many studies of HIFU were performed by manufacturers of HIFU devices, or members of manufacturers' advisory panels. Contraindications to HIFU for prostate cancer include a prostate volume larger than 40 grams, which can prevent targeted HIFU waves from reaching the anterior and anterobasal regions of the prostate, anatomic or pathologic conditions that may interfere with the introduction or displacement of the HIFU probe into the rectum, and high- volume calcification within the prostate, which can lead to HIFU scattering and transmission impairment. A 2012 UK trial of focal HIFU on 41 patients reported no histological evidence of cancer in 77% of men treated (95% confidence interval: 61 - 89%) at 12 month targeted biopsy, and a low rate of genitourinary side effects. However, this does not necessarily mean that 77% of men were definitively cured of prostate cancer, since systematic and random sampling errors are present in the biopsy process, and therefore recurrent or previously undetected cancer can be missed.  Life-style changes  Prostate enlargement can cause difficulties emptying the bladder completely. This situation, in which there is residual volume in the bladder is prone to complications such as cystitis and bladder stones, also commonly found in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. It was often suggested to change the voiding position of symptomatic males, however study results showed heterogeneity. A meta-analysis of people with prostate enlargement and healthy males showed a significant reduction of residual volume, while a trend towards an improved urinary flow rate and decreased voiding time was found. The effect of changing ones position is thought to arise from relaxation of the pelvic musculature, which are contracted in the standing position thereby influencing urodynamics. Frequent exercise such as brisk walking can delay the progress of prostate cancer Hormonal therapy Hormonal therapy in prostate cancer. Diagram shows the different organs (purple text), hormones (black text and arrows), and treatments (red text and arrows) important in hormonal therapy. =Androgen deprivation therapy= Hormonal therapy uses medications or surgery to block prostate cancer cells from getting dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone produced in the prostate and required for the growth and spread of most prostate cancer cells. Blocking DHT often causes prostate cancer to stop growing and even shrink. However, hormonal therapy rarely cures prostate cancer because cancers that initially respond to hormonal therapy typically become resistant after one to two years. Hormonal therapy is, therefore, usually used when cancer has spread from the prostate. It may also be given to certain men undergoing radiation therapy or surgery to help prevent return of their cancer. Review. Hormonal therapy for prostate cancer targets the pathways the body uses to produce DHT. A feedback loop involving the testicles, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary, adrenal, and prostate glands controls the blood levels of DHT. First, low blood levels of DHT stimulate the hypothalamus to produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH then stimulates the pituitary gland to produce luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH stimulates the testicles to produce testosterone. Finally, testosterone from the testicles and dehydroepiandrosterone from the adrenal glands stimulate the prostate to produce more DHT. Hormonal therapy can decrease levels of DHT by interrupting this pathway at any point. There are several forms of hormonal therapy: *Orchiectomy, also called \\"castration,\\" is surgery to remove the testicles. Because the testicles make most of the body's testosterone, after orchiectomy testosterone levels drop. Now the prostate not only lacks the testosterone stimulus to produce DHT but also does not have enough testosterone to transform into DHT. Orchiectomy is considered the gold standard of treatment. *Antiandrogens are medications such as flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and cyproterone acetate that directly block the actions of testosterone and DHT within prostate cancer cells. *Medications that block the production of adrenal androgens such as DHEA include ketoconazole and aminoglutethimide. Because the adrenal glands make only about 5% of the body's androgens, these medications are, in general, used only in combination with other methods that can block the 95% of androgens made by the testicles. These combined methods are called total androgen blockade (TAB). TAB can also be achieved using antiandrogens. *GnRH action can be interrupted in one of two ways. GnRH antagonists such as abarelix and degarelix suppress the production of LH directly by acting on the anterior pituitary. GnRH agonists such as leuprorelin and goserelin suppress LH through the process of downregulation after an initial stimulation effect which can cause initial tumor flare. In order to prevent stimulation of tumor growth during the initial LH surge, an antiandrogen such as cyproterone acetate is prescribed a week before and three weeks after GnRH agonists are given. Abarelix and degarelix are examples of GnRH antagonists, whereas the GnRH agonists include leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, and buserelin. Initially, GnRH agonists increase the production of LH. However, because the constant supply of the medication does not match the body's natural production rhythm, production of both LH and GnRH decreases after a few weeks. *Abiraterone acetate was FDA approved in April 2011 for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer for patients who have failed docetaxel therapy. Abiraterone acetate inhibits an enzyme known as CYP17, which is used in the body to produce testosterone. The most successful hormonal treatments are orchiectomy and GnRH agonists. Despite their higher cost, GnRH agonists are often chosen over orchiectomy for cosmetic and emotional reasons. Eventually, total androgen blockade may prove to be better than orchiectomy or GnRH agonists used alone. Each treatment has disadvantages that limit its use in certain circumstances. Although orchiectomy is a low-risk surgery, the psychological impact of removing the testicles can be significant, and sterility is certain. The loss of testosterone can cause hot flashes, weight gain, loss of libido, enlargement of the breasts (gynecomastia), impotence, penile atrophy, and osteoporosis. GnRH agonists eventually cause the same side effects as orchiectomy but may cause worse symptoms at the beginning of treatment. When GnRH agonists are first used, testosterone surges can lead to increased bone pain from metastatic cancer, so antiandrogens or abarelix is often added to blunt these side effects. Estrogens are not commonly used because they increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and blood clots. In general, the antiandrogens do not cause impotence, and usually cause less loss of bone and muscle mass. Ketoconazole can cause liver damage with prolonged use, and aminoglutethimide can cause skin rashes. =Estrogen therapy= High- dose estrogen therapy is used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Estrogens that have been used include diethylstilbestrol, fosfestrol, ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol undecylate, as well as the dual estrogenic and cytostatic agent estramustine phosphate. Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range via their antigonadotropic effects and they reduce the fraction of free and bioavailable testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin levels. Estrogens may also have direct cytotoxic effects in the prostate gland. Estrogens have been found to be equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy via surgical or medical castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. In addition, they prevent hot flashes, preserve bone density, preserve some sexual interest, have quality-of-life advantages, and are far less costly than conventional androgen deprivation therapy. However, estrogens cause feminization and gynecomastia as side effects. Moreover, at a dosage of 3 to 5 mg/day, diethylstilbestrol can increase cardiovascular mortality ‚Äì particularly in those patients who already have a compromised cardiovascular system. Diethylstilbestrol at 1 to 2 mg/day appears to be safe and effective for CRPC patients who have healthy cardiovascular systems and who concurrently take low-dose aspirin. Although the most commonly employed estrogens, oral and synthetic estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol, increase cardiovascular mortality, certain estrogens, namely bioidentical parenteral estrogens such as polyestradiol phosphate and high-dose transdermal estradiol, do not do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the estrogen classes on liver protein synthesis and by extension coagulation factors.  Recurrent disease  After surgery or radiation therapy, PSA may start to rise again, which is called biochemical recurrence if a certain threshold is met in PSA levels (typically 0.1 or 0.2 ng/ml for surgery). At 10 years of follow-up after surgery, there is an overall risk of biochemical recurrence of 30‚Äì50%, depending on the initial risk state, and salvage radiation therapy (SRT) is the only curative treatment. SRT is often administered in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for up to two years. A retrospective study of patients treated with SRT between 1987 and 2013 found that 56% of 2460 patients were free from biochemical failure after 5 years follow-up. Among those with a PSA less than 0.2 before SRT, this was 71%.  Extensive disease  Palliative care for advanced stage prostate cancer focuses on extending life and relieving the symptoms of metastatic disease. As noted above, abiraterone is showing some promise in treating advance-stage prostate cancer. It causes a dramatic reduction in PSA levels and tumor sizes in aggressive advanced-stage prostate cancer for 70% of patients. Chemotherapy may be offered to slow disease progression and postpone symptoms. The most commonly used regimen combines the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel with a corticosteroid such as prednisone. One study showed that treatment with docetaxel with prednisone prolonged life from 16.5 months for those taking mitoxantrone and prednisone to 18.9 months for those taking docetaxel + prednisone. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid have been shown to delay skeletal complications such as fractures or the need for radiation therapy in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Xofigo is a new alpha emitting pharmaceutical targeting bone metastasis. The phase II testing shows prolonged patient survival times, reduced pain, and improved quality of life. Bone pain due to metastatic disease is treated with opioid pain relievers such as morphine and oxycodone. External beam radiation therapy directed at bone metastases may provide pain relief. Injections of certain radioisotopes, such as strontium-89, phosphorus-32, or samarium-153, also target bone metastases and may help relieve pain. Alternative therapies As an alternative to active surveillance or definitive treatments, other therapies are also under investigation for the management of prostate cancer. PSA has been shown to be lowered in men with apparent localized prostate cancer using a vegan diet (fish allowed), regular exercise, and stress reduction. These results have so far proven durable after two-years' treatment. However, this study did not compare the vegan diet to either active surveillance or definitive treatment, and thus cannot comment on the comparative efficacy of the vegan diet in treating prostate cancer. Many other single agents have been shown to reduce PSA, slow PSA doubling times, or have similar effects on secondary markers in men with localized cancer in short term trials, such as pomegranate juice or genistein, an isoflavone found in various legumes. The potential of using multiple such agents in concert, let alone combining them with lifestyle changes, has not yet been studied. A more thorough review of natural approaches to prostate cancer has been published. Neutrons have been shown to be superior to X-rays in the treatment of prostatic cancer. The rationale is that tumours containing hypoxic cells (cells with enough oxygen concentration to be viable, yet not enough to be X-ray-radiosensitive) and cells deficient in oxygen are resistant to killing by X-rays. Thus, the lower Oxygen Enhancement Ratio (OER) of neutrons confers an advantage. Also, neutrons have a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for slow-growing tumours than X-rays, allowing for an advantage in tumour cell killing. =Prevention= Neither selenium nor vitamin E have been found to be effective in preventing prostate cancer. Trade-offs The trade-off dilemma refers to the choice between the expected beneficial and harmful effects in terms of survival and quality of life for a particular treatment. An example of such trade-off in prostate cancer treatment includes urinary and bowel symptoms and waning sexual function. How common these symptoms are and the distress they cause varies between types of treatment and individuals. One option is to trade off an intact sexual function for the possibility of a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects. A Swedish study found that the willingness to do this kind of trade-off varied considerably among men. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade- off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual‚Äôs feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer have no one to confide in except their spouse and one out of five live in total emotional isolation. The American Urological Association (AUA), American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), and the Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO) have issued joint guidelines on shared decision making with patients who have localized prostate cancer to help patients navigate these decisions.

PA474 is one of only two Lancasters in flying condition in the world, the other being owned and flown by the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum. History Accompanied by a Hawker Hurricane PA474 was built as a B Mk 1 (B1) by Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd at its Broughton factory near Chester in 1945 and was to be part of the British Tiger Force for strategic bombing in the Far East. Following the end of the war with Japan the aircraft was not needed and PA474 entered storage. With gun turrets removed it was assigned to Photographic Reconnaissance duties with 82 Squadron in East and South Africa. On return from squadron service PA474 was loaned to Flight Refuelling Limited to be used as a pilotless drone. Flight Refuelling used an Avro Lincoln instead and PA474 was then transferred to the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield, Bedfordshire to be used for trials on the Handley Page laminar flow wing. The test wings were mounted vertically above the rear fuselage. In 1964 PA474 came under the control of the Air Historical Branch for possible display in the proposed RAF Museum. During this time the aircraft appeared in two films: Operation Crossbow and The Guns of Navarone. PA474 was stored first at Wroughton and then at Henlow then, after a request in 1965 from 44 Squadron, the Lancaster moved to RAF Waddington for restoration back to wartime standard including refitting the front and rear turrets. PA474 was transferred to the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight in 1973. In 1975 a mid-upper turret was found in Argentina and fitted. During the winter of 1995 the Lancaster was fitted with a new main spar to extend the flying life. On 7 May 2015, the aircraft suffered a fire in its starboard outer engine. A safe landing was made at RAF Coningsby. It flew again on 12 October 2015 after extensive work to fix the damage caused by the fire to number four engine. It was later announced that with the ongoing maintenance, PA474 should still be airworthy until 2065.

The first section of the line was opened in 1812 as a branch of the S&WR; plateway from Lydney to Lydbrook, which had opened in 1810.Ron Huxley, The rise and fall of the Severn Bridge Railway, 1984, It was expanded over time to serve the collieries and quarries in the Bixslade valley (although the S&WR; referred to the line as the Bicslade Tramroad); the last stretch, to Bixhead Quarry, opened in 1855. Stone traffic ceased in 1944 and coal followed in 1946. History A preserved Bicslade tram at the Dean Heritage Centre Opened in 1812, the line ran between Bixhead Quarry and Bicslade Wharf. It served the Forest of Dean Stone Firm, Union Pit (also known as the Bixshead Slade Pit), Mine Train Quarry, Bixslade Low Level (Bixslade Deep Level), Hopewell Mapleford Colliery, Bixslade High Level (Bixslade Land Level), Spion Kop Quarry, Bixhead Quarry and Phoenix Colliery, in addition to several other minor quarries. Extensions and sidings were constructed continually between 1812 and 1855 to serve the different industries of the area. In 1855 the tramroad reached its largest extent, with two passing loops. From 1874, when the Severn and Wye Railway was converted into locomotive power, cargo carried by the line was transferred at Bicslade Wharf onto trains to be shipped to their destinations. In 1899 stone from Mine Train Quarry was being sent via the branch to the Marquis of Bute for work on the renovation of Cardiff Castle. The line gradually declined during the beginning of the 20th century; on 25 July 1944 the last stones were transported via the line and coal traffic stopped in 1946. The tramway continued to be operated by horse-power until traffic finally ceased in the 1950s, by which time it was the last working horse-powered tramroad operating in the Forest of Dean. Today Almost the entirety of the Tramroad's route has been converted into public footpaths. Nearby, Cannop Ponds (a reservoir which used the tramroad as a dam) is now a popular visitor attraction and picnic site, owned by the Forestry Commission. A guide along the path of the tramroad has been published by the local history society and is available in many nearby shops. One freemine, Monument Mine, and three quarries continue to operate in the Bixslade valley, largely hidden by woodland. Two of the trams on the line have been preserved and are now on public display at the Dean Heritage Centre and at the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum in Tywyn.

Fishes seen in the clear water of Rara Lake Rara National Park is a protected area in the Himalayas of Nepal and was established in 1976. Covering an area of in the Mugu and Jumla districts, it is the country's smallest national park. Its main feature is Rara Lake at an altitude of . The park was established to protect the unique flora and fauna of the Humla‚ÄìJumla Region of Nepal. The park ranges in elevation from to at Chuchemara Peak on the southern side of Rara Lake. On the northern side, the peaks of Ruma Kand and Malika Kand frame the alpine freshwater lake, which is the largest lake in Nepal with a surface of and a maximum depth of . It is oval-shaped with an east‚Äìwest axis, a length of and a width of draining into the Mugu-Karnali River via Nijar Khola. Rara National Park is managed by the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and protected with the assistance of the Nepal Army. Climate The climate of Rara National Park is pleasant during the summer, but becomes very cold during the winter, because of the altitude. The best times to visit the park are in September, October, April, and May. During the winter, temperatures drop below freezing, and many high passes become blocked by snow. The summer is warm, but June to August is monsoon season, making the trek to Rara National Park difficult.  Vegetation  One thousand and seventy species of flora are estimated from Rara National Park. Rhododendron, fir, brown oak, and birch species are found in the sub-alpine region. Below , the vegetation consists of mainly blue pine (Pinus excelsa), rhododendron (Rhododendron arboretum), west Himalayan spruce, black juniper and Himalayan cypress. Above , the vegetation changes to a coniferous forest consisting of a mixture of fir, spruce and pine. Fauna Fifty-one species of mammals, 241 species of birds, two species of reptiles and amphibians, and three species of fish have been recorded from the park including musk deer, red panda, snow leopard, Himalayan black bear, Indian leopard, jackal, Himalayan tahr, yellow-throated marten, otter, dhole, gray langur, and rhesus macaque. There are 241 recorded species of birds, including 49 wetland species. Coots are often found in the lake. During the winter, great-crested and black-necked grebes, red-crested pochards, mallard, common teal (Anas crecca), and common merganser are common. Other birds seen often include the Himalayan snowcock, chukar partridge, Himalayan monal, kalij pheasant and blood pheasant. In 1979, three endemic snowtrout species were collected in Lake Rara and described as new species: the Nepalese snowtrout Schizothorax nepalensis, the Rara snowtrout, and Nepalese snowtrout.Terashima, A. (1984) Three new species of the Cyprinid genus Schizothorax from Lake Rara, Northwestern Nepal. Japanese Journal of Ichthyology Vol. 31, No. 2: 122‚Äì135 Also in 1979, the frog species Paa rarica has been first recorded as endemic to the lake.Dubois, A., Matsui, M. (1983). A new species of frog (Genus Rana, Subgenus Paa) from western Nepal (Amphibia: Anura). Copeia: 895‚Äì901. Tourism Rara is budding as a tourist destination. There is little accommodations within the park. Visitors can fly from Kathmandu to Nepalgunj, followed by a flight to Talcha. From there, Rara lake can be reached in a few hours by walking. Rara National Park is an interesting destination for many interested in seeing various flora, fauna, and scenery unique to the area. GORP founder Bill Greer described Rara Lake as: :\\"a shimmering blue jewel set in a ring of snowy peaks\\"Gelber, E. Top Ten Treks in the Nepalese Himalaya Another travel writer describes a trek in the park: :\\"Although more trampled than in the past, the road to Rara Lake is still without any of the comfortable services available along more popular trails. Logistically it is not an easy trek; it is hard to get to and from, and it is an organizational challenge, requiring informed guides and porters to tote the two weeks' worth of material that will keep you warm, dry and fed. It is also tough on the bones, involving several 11,000-foot passes. However, once you overcome the obstacles, the rewards are legion: few if any other trekkers, incomparable natural splendor, \\"untouched\\" villages, blissful quiet‚Ä¶\\" There are no settlements within the boundaries of Rara National Park, as the two villages once inside the area, Rara and Chhapru, were resettled in the Banke District when the protected area was established. Agriculture is the basis for the local economy in the surrounding areas, which has led to pollution inside the park. Sediment from the surrounding hills as well as sewage and solid waste threaten the park.

Reintroduction of the cheetah in India involves the re-establishment of a population of cheetahs into areas where they had previously existed but were hunted into extinction during and after the Mughal Period, Rajput and Maratha Indian royalty and later by the British Raj , until the early 20th century when only several thousand remained. The Mughal emperor Akbar kept Cheetahs for hunting gazelle and blackbucks. Trapping of large numbers of adult Indian cheetahs, who had already learned hunting skills from wild mothers, for assisting in royal hunts is said to be another major cause of the species rapid decline in India as they never bred in captivity with only one record of a litter ever. Three of the last Asiatic cheetahs recorded from India were shot down in 1947, by Maharaja Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo of Koriya. A part of the reintroduction process is the identification and restoration of their former grassland scrub forest habitats.Karnad, D.Plan well to reintroduce Cheetah. http://governancenow.com/views/columns/plan-well-reintroduce-cheetah/ This is within the scope of the duties of the local forest department of each State, where relocation occurs, through the use of Indian Central Government funding. Background =History= Akbar, the third Mughal emperor, hunting with locally trapped Indian cheetahs, c. 1602. Until the 20th century, the Asiatic cheetah was quite common and roamed all the way from Israel, the Arabian Peninsula to Iran, Afghanistan and India. In India, they ranged as far south as the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. The Asiatic cheetah, also known as the \\"hunting leopard\\" in India was kept by kings and princes to hunt gazelle; the Mughal emperor Akbar kept them for hunting gazelle and blackbucks. He was said to have had 1,000 cheetahs at one time for assisting in his royal hunts, a number believed to be overestimated by many sources. Trapping of large numbers of adult Indian cheetahs, who had already learned hunting skills from wild mothers, for assisting in royal hunts is said to be another major cause of the species rapid decline in India as they never bred in captivity with only one litter on record ever. Extinction Hunting of blackbuck with Indian cheetah; Drawn by James Forbes in South Gujarat, India. Oriental Memoirs, 1812. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the species was already heading for extinction in many areas. There were certain places more affected by this problem than others. The Indian reserves were not very thoughtful when creating habitat loss for these oversized cats. The last physical evidence of the Asiatic cheetah in India was thought to be three, all shot by the Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo of Surguja State in 1947, in eastern Madhya Pradesh or northern Chhattisgarh, but a female was sighted in Koriya district, in what is now Chhattisgarh, in 1951. Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo shot three of the last cheetahs in India in 1948, in Surguja State, Madhya Pradesh. His private secretary submitted this photo to the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. In India in the mid-20th century, prey was abundant, and cheetahs fed on the blackbuck, the chinkara, and sometimes the chital and the nilgai. With the death of the last remaining population of the Asiatic cheetah in India, the species was declared extinct in India; it is the only animal in recorded history to become extinct from India due to unnatural causes. A consequence of the extinction of the cheetahs and subsequently the Indian royalty that prized them was that their grasslands homes came to be controlled, used and managed by local people. \\"The grasslands faded and diminished under the hooves of a thousand cattle, they were tilled and ploughed until only a few scattered remnants were preserved in the form of wildlife sanctuaries\\". Asiatic cheetah cubs in Dharwar, 1897 Reintroduction efforts = Cloning = During the early 2000s, Indian scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, proposed a plan to clone Asiatic cheetahs obtained from Iran. The idea of cloning was introduced by the people concerned with their population, which were few. India requested Iran to transport one live pair to India. If not possible, Indian scientists requested Iran to allow them to collect some live cells of the cheetah pair in Iran itself, which can then be made into living cell lines. They planned to use the nucleus from these cells to manually reproduce their own cheetahs, over a significantly long amount of time. At least the attempt was valid, but the process in receiving these materials was complicated. Iran refused to say that it would neither send any cheetahs to India nor would they allow Indian scientists to collect their tissue samples. It is said that Iran wanted an Asiatic lion in exchange for a cheetah and that India was not willing to export any of its lions. In 2009, the Indian government contacted Iran again to explore the possibility of Iran supplying cheetahs to help to re-establish their presence on the subcontinent decades after they were hunted to extinction. The Iranian embassy in Delhi had said that its government was in the process of \\"arranging\\" talks. Possible reintroduction sites Currently, wildlife experts have shortlisted three regions which have the potential to support cheetah populations. The Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary and Kuno-Palpur Wildlife Sanctuaries in Madhya Pradesh and the Shahgarh bulge landscape in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan have been declared potentially suitable for the reintroduction of the cheetah. The Kuno-Palpur Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh has the potential to hold populations of four of India's big cats; the Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, and Asiatic lion and cheetah, all four of which have co-existed in the same habitats historically for many years, before they were wiped out due to overhunting and habitat destruction. Since the Shahgarh Landscape is fenced along the Indo- Pakistani border region, the addition of more fencing will ensure adequate protection for the cheetah population. The Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary (1197km2) is part of a much larger forested landscape (5500km2 ) which can host the cheetah as well.Assessing the potential for reintroducing the cheetah in India, 2010.

Frederick Augustus Nicholson, the then British Collector has reported to have shot a few individuals near Kothamangalam, Velamundi and Bolampatti (all in NBR). This region is on the leeward side of SW monsoon. Genetic subspecies level differentiation The Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) has, for a long time, been classified as a subspecies of the cheetah, with the suffix \\"venaticus\\" applied at the end of its scientific binomial name Acinonyx jubatus. However, at a cheetah reintroduction workshop organised in India on 9 September 2009, Stephen J. O'Brien from the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity of National Cancer Institute of the United States said that according to the latest genetic studies, the Asiatic cheetah was, in fact, genetically identical to the African cheetah with which it had separated only 5,000 years ago. This was not enough time for a subspecies level differentiation; O'Brien said that in comparison the Asiatic and African lion subspecies were separated some 100,000 years ago, and African and Asian leopard subspecies about 169,000 years ago. Subsequently, in 2011, a much more detailed five-year genetic study involving gathering of DNA samples from the wild, zoos and museums in eight countries was published in Molecular Ecology (Journal) on 8 January 2011. This newer study concluded that African and Asiatic cheetahs were genetically distinct and separated 32,000 to 67,000 years ago. Subspecies level differentiation had taken place due to longer separation from the African population.Three distinct cheetah populations, but Iran's on the brink; 18 January 2011; USA TodayAsian cheetahs racing toward extinction; 24 January 2011; Scientific American magazine; retrieved on 29 January 2011The Need for Conservation of Asiatic Cheetahs; 17 January 2011; ScienceDaily; retrieved on 29 January 2011 =Introduction of African cheetah= Since the Asiatic cheetah became extinct in India in 1947, plans to reestablish the cheetah in India have been ongoing.Cheetahs may soon be on the prowl in Indian woods; by Vinay Madhav; 27 October 1998; The Indian express newspaperBook Review: Pug Marks In Time - A superb book documents the history and demise of the cheetah; by Mahesh Rangarajan; 27 March 1996; Outlook India Magazine.

Laurie Marker of the Cheetah Conservation Fund, Stephen J.

The meeting also identified Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania, and the UAE as countries from where the cheetah could be imported to India. \\"About 5 to 10 animals annually have to be brought to India over a period of 5 to 10 years,\\" recommended another working group, which was formed for exploring sourcing and translocation of the cheetah.More places identified for housing cheetah; by Anindo Dey, TNN; 11 September 2009; Times of IndiaCheetahs on their way to Gujarat? 12 September 2009; Times of IndiaIndia plans return of the cheetah - India plans to bring back the cheetah, nearly half a century after it became extinct in the country.

As a first step, a two-day seminar of technical experts on cheetahs was held in Gajner from 9 September 2009. Experts on cheetah, including Divyabhanusinh Chavda and M K Ranjitsinh presented their papers on how to go about bringing cheetahs to India. The initial plans were to bring the cheetahs to Gajner Wildlife Sanctuary. \\"We want to set up a breeding ground for the cheetahs and Gajner seems to fit the bill perfectly. Thereafter, they will be transported to various states,\\" he added. India is also in talks with the Islamic Republic of Iran over the possibility of sending a pair of Asiatic cheetahs to India. The Iranian embassy in Delhi said that its government was in the process of \\"arranging\\" talks. The Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh said that African cheetahs could be brought to India within three years having just returned from a trip to South Africa, one of the potential source-habitats of cheetahs to be moved to India. The Wildlife Institute of India is spearheading the project, and will unveil a road map and destination for the African cheetahs ‚Äì possible options are in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat ‚Äì by the end of May. Kuno Palpur and Nauradehi Sancturies in Madhya Pradesh and Shahgarh landscape in Jaisalmer in Rajasthan have been selected in by the Wildlife Institute of India as most suitable sites for the reintroduction project. In May 2012 the Indian Supreme Court had put the project of importing cheetahs from Africa and reintroducing them in India on hold. Some Conservationists have been fighting a legal battle in Indian Supreme Court to get the Indian State Government of Gujarat to break its monopolizing of wild Asiatic lions and release a few overpopulated prides of lions spilling out of Gir National Park for reintroduction in the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the neighbouring Indian State of Madhya Pradesh which was prepared for them after relocating over 24 villages out of the forest. In the past, for last two decades the State Government of Gujarat had concocted every possible reason to maintain its monopoly on wild Asiatic lions and the tourism revenue generated by them and of recent Gujarat's legal council had put forward the argument that Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary is being used for the introduction of African cheetah which might take several years to fully settle down and repopulate the area and hence reintroduction of lions should only be done after that, this scared the conservationists that Gujarat will use this pretext to delay the reintroduction of native lions by many more decades using the cheetah argument. Indian Supreme court has taken note of the arguments put forth by some Indian conservationists that importing African cheetah for reintroduction in India is misguided as it is against the International Union for Conservation of Nature's reintroduction guidelines and no clearance had been sought from India's National Board for Wildlife. The Indian Supreme Court has fast tracked the case for the re-introduction of lions to Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary and is hearing it every Monday.Asiatic lion may roar at new home in Kuno-Palpur sanctuary, Ahmedabad/New Delhi, 09/May/2012, Daily Bhaskar; Gujarat, MP fight for Asiatic lions‚Äô share, Source: DNA, 01/May/2012, Daily Bhaskar Senior advocate PS Narasimha, court-appointed adviser and the amicus curiae in the Asiatic lion's relocation case in India's Supreme Court, filed an application seeking a stay on the implementation of African cheetah reintroduction project in India. The Indian Supreme court had granted the stay and the matter has been scheduled for further hearing in July 2012 after the court returns from vacation. During its hearings, the Bench was informed that India's Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has decided to introduce the Southern African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) from Namibia into Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, the same proposed habitat being developed as the second home for the translocation of lions from Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in the neighbouring Indian state of Gujarat which did not want to shift any lions out of the state. Narasimha said the proposal for reintroduction of African cheetah \\"has not been either placed before the Standing Committee of India's National Board for Wildlife, nor has there been a considered decision taken in this regard\\". He stated in an application that \\"scientific studies show that the African cheetahs and Asian Cheetahs are completely different, both genetically and also in their characteristics\\" and the reintroduction of African cheetah in India was also against the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) guidelines on translocation of wildlife species. \\"In fact, the (IUCN) guidelines categorically warn against the introduction of alien or exotic species. The African Cheetah obviously never existed in India. Therefore, it is not case of intentional movement of an organism into a part of its native range,\\" the application stated. Asiatic cheetah became extinct in India in the 1950s, In the past, India's last recorded cheetah in the wild was said to have been shot in the Rewa area of Madhya Pradesh in the late 1940s. It was mentioned that the introduction of alien or exotic species is universally shunned by wildlife experts and \\"in fact countries such as South Africa, Australia are spending huge amount of funds to eradicate and remove exotic wildlife species from wilderness areas or wild habitats\\". Narasimha also sought a direction of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to produce before the apex court all relevant records and decisions relating to introduction of cheetah. He said the Indian cheetah in genetic composition is a different animal than the African cheetah and a different subspecies altogether and \\"therefore one cannot be introduced in place of the other\\". Conservationists say no more than 50 of the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah remain only in Iran, roaming the central deserts. The vast majority of the 7,000 cheetahs left in the world are in Africa.

The ruling came in response to an application filed by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) seeking permission to introduce Southern African cheetahs from Namibia. The Supreme Court set up a three-member committee to guide the NTCA and asked the committee to submit a progress report every four months.

Based in Glasgow, the group released three albums through Honest Jon's Records. A fourth, The Sovereign Self, was released on 29 June 2015, followed by an EP in 2016, both on Tin Angel Records. Their last album, Dungeness, was released in March 2018. In September 2018, frontwoman Lavinia Blackwall announced she was leaving the band after 10 years. Following a further run of gigs, the band announced they were to split, with members focussing on their individual projects. Career Neilson had previously collaborated with early music vocalist and musician Lavinia Blackwall in the free improvisation folk music project Directing Hand. Neilson gathered a group from members of his previous musical projects, consisting of bassist Simon Shaw (formerly of Lucky Luke) and guitarist Ben Reynolds along with occasional players George Murray (trombone) and Aby Vuillamy (viola), both formerly of Scatter and The One Ensemble. The group signed to Honest Jon's Records in 2009 and released debut Carbeth in April 2009. The album was well received by critics. Carbeth holds a 76 (mostly favourable) rating from 7 reviews at Metacritic. The band's second album, Abandoned Love, was co-produced with Belle and Sebastian member Stevie Jackson and released a year later in April 2010. Between albums Ben Reynolds was replaced by Mike Hastings on guitar. The critical response to this album was again positive. \\"Hidebound fol-de-rolling is just not an option for this band; they take the antic forms, loosen them and make them arresting and new once more.\\" wrote Kitty Empire in The Guardian. Comparing with the debut album John Mulvey said that \\"The same elements remain ‚Äì though perhaps less String Bandish whimsy ‚Äì but this time, Trembling Bells are gutsier, more forthright, glowing with confidence\\" Abandoned Love was tipped as a possible nomination for the 2010 Mercury Music Prize, but their label did not enter the album into the contest. Third album, The Constant Pageant was released on 21 March 2011. Reviews were again generally favourable. Critics observed a move towards mainstream pop Popmatters gave the album nine out of ten, stating \\"We should probably be careful about reading too much development into the material on album number three, because some of it appears to date back to the time of their debut (‚ÄúGoathland‚Äù, for example, was in the band‚Äôs live repertoire from the start). Even so, it is still tempting to say that The Constant Pageant is the strongest collection Trembling Bells have yet put out.\\" The reviewer for Uncut gave a mixed review, writing \\"one hopes the band will not steer too close to plain old indie rock.\\" The album has an 81 out of 100 at Metacritic based on 5 reviews. Trembling Bells performed a BBC Radio 6 Music session on the Marc Riley show on Monday 6 June 2011. A fourth Trembling Bells album, The Sovereign Self, was released by Tin Angel Records on 29 June 2015. A fifth album, Wide Majestic Aire, came out on 1 April 2016, also on Tin Angel Records. Album number six, Dungeness, was released on 30 March 2018, again on Tin Angel Records. Following Lavinia Blackwall's announcement she was leaving the band, Trembling Bells decided to split at the end of 2018. Their final release was a 2019 Record Store Day 10\\", I am the King, a joint work with Alex Neilson's solo project Alex Rex. Blackwall released her debut solo single \\"Waiting for Tomorrow\\" in December 2018, followed by an album, Muggington Lane End, in May 2020. Simon Shaw's band Youth of America released its debut album YOA Rising in January 2019 on Fighting Swans Records. Influences and style Trembling Bells' references late 1960s psychedelia and British folk revival acts such as Fairport Convention and the Incredible String Band. Lavinia Blackwall's soaring vocal style has drawn comparisons to Sandy DennySee, for example, John Mulvey in Mojo, October 2010 regarding the \\"alignment\\" of the Bells with Fairport Convention and We Five's Beverly Bivens. Stuart Maconie described their music as \\"wild and romantic, witty and heartbreaking\\", saying that \\"It has both the charm of folk music and the power of rock\\". John Mulvey has said \\"the rickety spirit of various Pastels/Bill Wells affiliates can be heard occasionally\\" Live performances and tours Trembling Bells played at Green Man Festival 2009. In 2010 they performed at All Tomorrow's Parties Bowlie Weekender 2 curated by Belle and Sebastian. The group toured the UK and Ireland in Spring 2011 to promote The Constant Pageant In August 2011, the group conducted a 5-date tour of the UK in collaboration with Mike Heron of the Incredible String Band. Reviewing their London show at the Vortex Jazz Club Robin Denselow gave it four out of five stars and said the gig was \\"This was an intriguing double bill, matching one of the originators of the experimental British psych-folk scene against its most interesting current exponents.\\" Mike Heron & Trembling Bells with Shelah McDonald, Oran Mor - Glasgow 2 August 2013.

It includes two halls, The Large Hall and The Small Hall, and is used for many disparate events such as comedy acts, conferences, craft fairs, live music, talks, and weddings. It is also used by the University of Cambridge for certain examinations. It is owned and managed by the Cambridge City Council, and it is their seat of government. The Guildhall is located on the south side of Market Hill, the market square in Cambridge, between Peas Hill to the west and Guildhall Street to the east. It is a Grade II listed building. History The earliest known property on the site was a house, previously owned by a Jew known as Benjamin, which King Henry III granted to the town for use as a prison in 1224. An adjoining synagogue was leased to the Franciscans who later moved to a convent on a site where Sidney Sussex College now stands. In 1270 the premises became the \\"tolbooth\\" as it was known then since its main function concerned tolls for entry to the town and trading at the market. The tollbooth was also used for plays and the troupe of actors, Queen Elizabeth's Men, performed regularly between 1561 and 1562 and again between 1596 and 1597. In 1747, a shire house, designed by Sharman and Barratt in the Classical style, was built, on arches with stalls beneath, on the open area at the front of the Market Square, just to the north of the old tollbooth. Meanwhile, the old tollbooth was rebuilt to a design by James Essex at a cost of ¬£2,500 in 1782. The shire house and the tollbooth were connected by a wooden bridge over Butter Row, a narrow market street with stalls selling dairy products. The two buildings operated collectively as \\"the guildhall\\" from the late 1840s. After the old guildhall became inadequate for the council's needs, the current guildhall, which was designed by Charles Cowles- Voysey in the Neo-Georgian style, was built on the site of the two original buildings at a cost of ¬£150,000 and completed in 1939. A sculpture created by Michael Ayrton in 1950, entitled \\"Talos\\", was erected Guildhall Street in 1973.

Pouch√©e soon became a major manufacturer of pictorial stock-blocks and printers' ornaments. Type from Pouch√©e's foundry was used to print the Evening Times newspaper.The Proceedings of the Old Bailey Ref: t18281023-55 - John Osborne, Theft: Simple Grand Larceny 23 October 1828. Pouch√©e recruited skilled staff and paid high wages, but sold his type more cheaply than other foundries. He was forced out of business in 1830 by the other typefounders, whose prices he undercut.Andrew Murphy, Shakespeare in Print: A History and Chronology of Shakespeare Publishing, 2003, p.172 Pouch√©e sold his typecasting machine to Mr Reed, Covent Garden printer, for ¬£100,John Squair, Reports by the juries on the subjects in the thirty classes into which the exhibition was divided, Volume 1, 1852, p. 408 however Reed was frontman for a syndicate of type founders, who arranged to have the machine taken out to sea and dumped over board.John Southward, Progress in Printing and the Graphic Arts during the Victorian Era, 1897, p. 60 Pouch√©e was a Freemason (he was initiated into the Egyptian Lodge in October 1811) and owned numerous hare coursing greyhounds.

The discovery and reproduction of Pouch√©e's Alphabets  Some 23 of Pouch√©e's decorated alphabets have survived and are now held at the St Bride Library. They were discovered at the sale of the H. W. Caslon & Co foundry in 1936, at that time identified simply as \\"Victorian\\" curiosities; and after spending the World War II in a store in London were transferred for a time to Oxford University Press. It wasn't until 1966 that they were identified, by St Bride Librarian James Mosley, as being from the foundry of L. J. Pouch√©e. This finding was afterwards corroborated by the discovery of a type catalogue, Specimens of Stereotype Casting, from the Foundry of L J Pouch√©e. These original wooden blocks have since been used by Ian Mortimer for reproduction sets using iron hand presses. Published by I. M. Imprint and St Bride Library, 200 sets were produced over a period of two and a half years. Characters from one of Pouch√©e's alphabets are used on the cover artwork for the Pulp album We Love Life,Emily King, \\"Everyday Exotics\\" in Frieze Magazine, issue 68, 2002 designed by Peter Saville.

Linked lists are one of the Lisp language's major data structures, and Lisp source code is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new domain-specific programming languages embedded in Lisp.

For each action preconditions (what must be established before the action is performed) and postconditions (what is established after the action is performed) are specified. * Planner is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages. It gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted with pattern-directed inference. * POP-11 is a reflective, incrementally compiled programming language with many of the features of an interpreted language. It is the core language of the Poplog programming environment developed originally by the University of Sussex, and recently in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham which hosts the Poplog website, It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like Pascal, who find POP syntax more familiar than that of Lisp. One of POP-11's features is that it supports first-class functions. *R is widely used in new-style artificial intelligence, involving statistical computations, numerical analysis, the use of Bayesian inference, neural networks and in general Machine Learning. In domains like finance, biology, sociology or medicine it is considered as one of the main standard languages.

He became known in the second half of the 1570s. His compositions are included in the most important sources of Utraquist polyphony.Horyna (2009), p. 12  Biography  In the oldest sources, his name was Latinized to Traianus Turnovinus or Traianus Gregorides Turnovinus. Later he began to use the name Jan. The sources from Bene≈°ov call him \\"knƒõz Jan Traian\\" (priest Jan Traian). Very little is known about his early life. He was born in Turnov, and his father was a baker. The oldest known mention of his life dates from 1564 when he was matriculated at the Charles University in Prague. He was matriculated together with several other composers, Ji≈ô√≠ Rychnovsk√Ω and Pavel Spongopaeus Jistebnick√Ω among others. However, it is not entirely clear whether they really studied there. As an Utraquist priest he served in Davle (1579), and the same year he was possibly active also in Mlad√° Boleslav. Later he moved to Netvo≈ôice (1581), Bene≈°ov (1587), and Sepekov (1595, probably before 1590). Turnovsk√Ω was married two times. He married his first wife Kate≈ôina on 11 November 1579 in Mlad√° Boleslav. In 1604, he  together with his second wife Zuzana Jezberov√°  bought a house in Bene≈°ov. The payment from 1606 is the last mention of his life.  Style and works  The oldest dated composition originates from 1572, the earliest work was composed in 1602. Fifteen of his forty compositions have been preserved completely. A half of Trojan's compositions is preserved and carefully dated in the collection Bene≈°ovsk√Ω kancion√°l (Bene≈°ov Hymnbook), collected by V√°clav Kol√°≈ôovic (died 1596). One Latin ordinarium, two responsories and eleven Czech songs have been completely preserved. In addition to this Trojan composed six Czech and four Latin motets, two song fragments, five Czech plenaria and seven compositions intended for Utraquist religious service. These compositions are preserved in fragments. Some of his works are preserved in the sources of Czech literary fraternities in Prague, Rokycany, Hradec Kr√°lov√© and Jaromƒõ≈ô. Trojan's compositions are remarkable for their well-handled polyphony technique and careful work with words in relation to music. Selected compositions: *Missa super Jerusalem cito veniet (1578) - the most valuable composition, written to the theme of Jacob Clemens non Papa *Jezu Kriste Vykupiteli - Czech motet *Vstal≈• jest z mrtv√Ωch Kristus P√°n - Easter motet  Notes   References  *  Further reading  *Horyna, Martin: Jan Trojan Turnovsk√Ω (ca 1550‚Äì1606).

The Badrinath temple, called the Badri Vishal (altitude ) is the primary temple among the seven shrines. The other six being Adi Badri, Bhavishya Badri, Yogadhayan Badri, Vriddha Badri, Ardha Badri and Dhyan Badri. The Panch Badri temple circuit consisted of only five temples, omitting Ardha Badri and usually Dhyan Badri (or sometimes Vriddha Badri). Rarely, Narasingh Badri, is included in the Sapta Badri or Panch Badri list. The abode of Vishnu in the Alaknanda river valley, starting from Satapanth about above Badrinath extending up to Nandprayag in the south, is particularly known as the Badri Kshetra in which all the Badri temples are located. Since the early times, approach to the main temple of Badrinath was only along a bridle path passing through badri van or (forest of berries). Thus, the word \\"Badri\\", meaning \\"berries\\", is suffixed to the names of all the Sapta Badri (seven) temples. The main shrine of Badrinath is well connected by road and air but is closed during the winter season due to snow conditions, from October‚ÄìNovember to April‚ÄìMay depending on the astrological dates fixed by the Temple Committee; the Raj Purohit (Royal priest) decides the auspicious day for opening the temple kapat (doors) on Vasant Panchami day in end of April/early May while the closing day is Vijayadashami day in October/November. The other six temples are located in villages, largely in remote locations. A few of them can be approached only by trekking along bridle paths. Badrinath Badrivishal of Sapta Badri Badrinath is the northern Dham of the four sacred Dhams (pilgrimage centres) called Char Dham. Though the Badrinath temple is believed to date to the Vedic period, the current structure was built in the 8th century AD by Adi Shankaracharya. The other three dhams are Rameshwaram in the south, Dwarka in the west and Jagannath Puri in the east; all of these four temples are dedicated to god Vishnu. Adi Shankara's basic intention was to unite the country under the banner of Hinduism. The temple, which had been subjected to damage due to snow avalanches and landslides, several times in the past, was last restored in the 19th century with the royal patronage of the Scindias and Holkars. Badrinath is also part of Chota Char Dham, four sacred temples in Uttarakhand. The others include the Shiva temple of Kedarnath and the sources of the holy rivers Ganges and Yamuna. The Badrinath legend states that Vishnu (Mahavishnu) in his incarnation as the sages Nara and Narayana, did penance in an open space at the location of the Badrikashram or Badrinath. His consort Lakshmi (Maha-lakshmi) created shelter for him in the form of Badri tree (berry tree) to protect him from adverse climatic conditions. The sage Narada did penance here, and is believed to continue to do so to this day by reciting the divine chants called Ashta Akshara mantras (eight lettered mantra, i.e., Om Namo Narayanaye). Narada was also informed by Vishnu that his divine form subsumed both Nara and Narayana. According to the scripture Bhagavata Purana, \\"There in Badrikashram (Badrinath) the Personality of Godhead (Vishnu), in his incarnation as the sages Nara and Narayana, had been undergoing great penance since time immemorial for the welfare of all living entities.\\" (3.4.22) The layout of the temple has three enclosures namely, the Garbhagriha (Sanctum Sanctorum), the Darshan Mandap (worship hall) and Sabha Mandap (Conference hall). The sanctum holds the central image of Badri-narayana (Vishnu), which is made in black stone and in height. The four- armed Vishnu holds the Shankh (Conch) and Sudarshana Chakra (discus) in two arms in a raised posture and the other two arms rest on the lap in Yogamudra (meditative pose). The images of religious leaders Adi Shankara, Swami Vedanta Desikan and Ramanujacharya are also worshipped here. In the sanctum, to the far right side are Nara and Narayana. Narada is kneeling in front on the right side and is difficult to see. On the left side is Kubera, the god of wealth. Garuda, Vishnu's vehicle is kneeling in front, to the left of Badri-narayana. Wings at the entrance are adorned with images of Hanuman, the monkey-god and a silver Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom. In the enclosure (prakara) surrounding the temple, a small shrine is dedicated to Lakshmi, Vishnu's consort. Nambudiri Brahmins from southern state of Kerala serve as head priests here. Adi Badri Adi Badri complex of temples near Karnaprayag Chandpur Garhi Fort, temple is 3km from it. The Adi Badri () the first temple complex among the Sapta Badri temples is an ancient shrine dedicated to Vishnu and is one among a chain of 16 small shrines located in the hill ranges , beyond Karnaprayag (confluence of Pindar River and Alaknanda River in Chamoli district. Seven temples of this chain were built during the late Gupta period (5th century to 8th century). According to tradition, Adi Shankara is attributed as builder of all the temples. Adi Shankara is believed to have sanctioned these temples in order to spread Hinduism to every remote part of the country. In ancient times, when approach to the main shrine of Badrinath was closed due to weather conditions, pilgrims worshipped Vishnu at this temple. Adi Badri, also known as Helisera according to revenue records, is a tiny temple complex enclosed within a space of X . The height of the temples vary from . The chief temple is dedicated to god Vishnu, which is built over a raised platform, with a small enclosure in a pyramidal form. The sanctum holds black stone image of Vishnu. The image depicts Vishnu holding a mace, lotus and chakra (discus). Brahmins from South India serve as chief priests in the temple. Adi Badri is located from Chandpur fort or Garhi located on the hilltop, which was built by the Parmar kings of garhwal. Adi Badri is an hour's drive from Karnaprayag and close to Chulakot on the way to Ranikhet. On shifting of Badrinath (also known as Raj Badri) to Bhavishya Badri, Adi Badri will be called the Yog Badri. Vriddha Badri Vriddha Badri or Briddha Badri - an austere shrine, is located in the Animath village ( , above sea level) , from Joshimath on the Rishikesh‚ÄìJoshimath-Badrinath road. The Vriddha Badri legend says that Vishnu appeared in the form of a Vriddha or old man before sage Narada who performed penance here. Thus, the idol installed at this temple is in the form of an old man. According to legend, the image of Badrinath was carved by the divine craftsman Vishwakarma and worshipped here. At the advent of Kali yuga, Vishnu chose to remove himself from this place, later Adi Shankara found the partly damaged image in Narad-kund pond and established it at the central Badrinath shrine. According to legend, Badrinath was worshipped here by Adi Shankara, before his enshrinement at the Badrinath temple. The temple is open throughout the year. Brahmins from South India serve as chief priests in the temple. Bhavishya Badri Bhavishya Badri, also spelt as Bhabisya Badri, , above sea level) is located in a village called Subhain at a distance of from Joshimath, beyond Tapovan and approach is through dense forest, only by trekking. It is situated on an ancient pilgrim route to Mount Kailash and Manasarovar, along the Dhauli Ganges River. It is situated on the way from Tapovan to Lata in the Niti Valley. Bhavishya Badri is connected by a motorable road to Saldhar,, from Joshimath, beyond which a trek is undertaken to reach the shrine. According to the legend of Bhavishya Badri (literally \\"Badri of the future\\"), when evil transcends the world, the mountains of Nara and Narayana would block up the route to Badrinath and the sacred shrine would become inaccessible. The present world will be destroyed and a new one established. Then, Badrinath will appear at the Bhavishya Badri temple and be worshipped here, instead of the Badrinath shrine. The shrine of Narasingh Badri at Joshimath is closely associated with the legend of Bhavishya Badri (see section below). Currently, the Bhavishya Badri has an image of Narasimha, the lion-faced incarnation and one of the ten avatars of Vishnu. Yogadhyan Badri Yogadhyan Badri, also called Yoga Badri, is located at Pandukeshwar () at the elevation of , close to Govind Ghat and is as ancient as the main Badrinath temple. Pandukeshwar is located en route from Govind Ghat to Hanuman Chatti, away from Hanuman Chatti. Legend has it that King Pandu, father of the five Pandavas - heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, meditated here to god Vishnu to cleanse him of the sin of killing of two mating deer, who were ascetics in their previous lives. The Pandavas were also born here and Pandu died and attained salvation here. Pandu is believed to have installed the bronze image of Vishnu in the Yogadhyan Badri shrine. The image is in a meditative posture and thus the image is called Yoga-dhyan (mediative) Badri. The idol is life size and has been carved from Shaligram stone. According to legend, the Pandavas, after defeating and killing their cousins Kauravas in the Mahabharata war, came here to repent. They handed their kingdom of Hastinapur to their grandson Parikshit and went to perform penance in the Himalayas. Copper plate inscriptions found here indicate rule by early Katyuri Rajas and the region was known as Panchal Desh, now officially designated as Uttarakhand. One inscription extols the grant of land given by King Nimbarana. Another historic location is the Suryakund, on top of Milam glacier, which is a hot water spring, where Kunti - mother of Pandavas gave birth to her illegitimate son Karna, fathered by the sun-god Surya. Kunti was married to Pandu at Pandukeshwar. Yogdhyan Badri is also considered the winter abode for the Utsava-murti (festival-image) of Badrinath, when the temple of Badrinath is closed. Hence, it is religiously ordained that a pilgrimage will not be complete without offering prayers at this place. Bhatts (priests) from South India serve as chief priests in the temple. Dhyan Badri Dhyan Badri (, above sea level) is located in the Urgam valley, close to Kalpeshwar () on the banks of river Kalpa Ganga. It can be reached from Helang Chatti which is situated on the NH7 (Chamoli - Joshimath road) & then further drive down to Urgam, Lyari & Devagram followed by a trek. The legend of Dhyan Badri (meditating Badri) is linked to the Urvarishi, son of King Puranjaya of the Pandavas lineage who meditated in the Urgam region and established the temple for Vishnu. The image of Vishnu is four-armed, made of black stone and in a mediatative posture. There is also a temple to god Shiva built by Adi Shankara. Kalpeshwar, one of the Panch Kedar sacred temple of Shiva, is situated , away. The temple is sometimes included in the Panch-Badri list. Brahmins from South India serve as head priests in the temple. Ardha Badri Ardha Badri, located on the Joshimath-Tapovan road is in a remote village and can be approached only by trekking along a steep bridle path. As the size of the idol is small, the temple is called Ardha Badri (literal meaning half Badri). Narasingh Badri The existing temple of Narasimha (Narasingh) at Joshimath (), also called as Narasingh Badri or Narasimha Badri, is closely linked to the Bhavishya Badri legend, even though usually it is regarded as not one of the famous Panch Badri or Sapta Badri. Sometimes, it may be included in the Sapta-Badri list instead of Ardha-Badri or Panch-Badri list instead of Dhyan Badri. The chief image of Narasimha is made out of the Shaligram stone, in the eighth century during the reign of king Lalitaditya Yukta Pida of Kashmir. Some believe the image is self- manifested (swayambhu). The image is high and depicts the god sitting in the lotus position. It is believed that one arm of the image is getting emaciated with time and finally fall off. When the arm disappears, the main shrine of Badrinath will be closed to the world and Lord Badrinath will shift to Bhavishya Badri shrine. With this cataclysmic event, Kali yuga will end ushering in the Satya yuga. Then the Badrinath shrine would get re- established. When the chief Badrinath shrine is closed in winter, the priests of Badrinath shift to this temple and continue their worship to Badrinath here. Along with the central Narasimha image, the temple also has an image of Badrinath. Access While some shrines are approached by motorable roads, others are approachable from the nearest road head by trekking, on the Rishikesh-Badrinath main State Highway. The nearest airport to the Sapta Badri is Jolly Grant Airport close to Rishikesh, but to Dehradun. Motorable road distance to the seven shrines from Rishikesh are: to Badrinath - ; Yogdhyan Badri-, short of Badrinath; Adi Badri - up to Karnaprayag and a further deviation on the Ranikhet road for to reach the shrine; Dhyan Badri - to Badrinath and a further trek of en route to Joshimath; Vriddha Badri - trek from Joshimath; Bhavishya Badri - up to Siladhar by road and further trek of to the shrine.

Seo is best remembered for his diplomatic skills that led 60,000 Khitan troops to withdraw from Goryeo without a battle. Family Seo Hui was of the Icheon Seo clan and was the son of Seo Pil (ÂæêÂºº) who, during the King Gwangjong's reign, served as Naeuiryeong (ÂÖßË≠∞‰ª§), the highest official post of Naeuiseong (ÂÖßË≠∞ÁúÅ), the advisory council for the King. Until the time of his grandfather, Seo Sin-il (ÂæêÁ•ûÈÄ∏), the Seo clan was a hojok (Ë±™Êóè) or a powerful local gentry based in what is now the Icheon areas, in the southeast of the Gyeonggi Province. Like his father, Seo Hui became a jaesang (ÂÆ∞Áõ∏), the collective term referring to officials with a high rank in ancient Korea. His sons, Seo Nul (ÂæêË®•) and Seo Yu-geol (ÂæêÊÉüÂÇë) also followed their father's footstep by serving respectively as Munha sijung (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æç‰∏≠), the title of the highest minister of state, and Jwabokya (Â∑¶ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), the second rank of Sangseoseong (Â∞ôÊõ∏ÁúÅ), Secretariat for State Affairs of Goryeo. As one of Seo Nul's daughters later became a queen by marrying King Hyeonjong, Seo Hui's clan was related to the King on the King's mother's side. With this background and his own talent, Seo Hui managed to establish a successful career. Career After Seo Hui passed gwageo, the state examination, with a high grade, in March 960, the 11th year of King Gwangjong's reign, he served for the government as the Gwangpyeongwon eorang () and Naeui sirang () posts. In 983, Seo became Byeonggwan eosa (), the official in charge of military affairs. Soon after that, he was appointed to important positions like Naesasirang pyeongsangsa (), the second rank of Naesaseong (Supreme Council during the period), and finally he was raised to the highest position of Taebo Naesaryeong, the head of Supreme Council. In addition to his role in domestic politics, Seo engaged in diplomacy by going to China in 972 and playing an important role in re-establishing the diplomatic relationship between Goryeo and the Chinese Song Dynasty, which had been broken off over a decade earlier. =Negotiations with Liao= However, he is most remembered in his diplomatic career for his direct negotiations with General Xiao Sunning of the Liao Dynasty, which prevented a fullscale invasion by a host of Khitan troops: According to the story, after Xiao captured Pongsan county in 993 and forced Goryeo's forces to retreat behind the Taedong River, he wrote to demand Goryeo's surrender: \\"[O]ur great country is about to unify land on all four directions\\" and to justify the expedition by charging: \\"your country does not take care of the people's needs, we solemnly execute heaven's punishment on its behalf\\". King Seongjong of Goryeo initially accepted Liao's demands, planning on the advice of his negotiators to give up the land north of Pyongyang to Xiao and drawing the Liao-Goryeo border in a straight line between Hwangju and P'ary≈èng. Seo Hui, however, was convinced that the Liao were acting from a position of \\"fear of us\\" and begged the king to \\"return to the capital and let us, your officers, wage one more battle\\". Seo rhetorically referred to the land that King Gwangjong had conquered from the Jurchens and which the Khitans (Liao) now held as \\"former Kogury≈è territory\\". After Xiao's forces were repulsed from further advances at the Battle of Anyung Fortress, Seo went to the Liao encampment to negotiate a settlement. Part of their conversation is excerpted: > Xiao: Your country arose in Silla territory. Kogury≈è territory is in our > possession. But you have encroached on it. Your country is connected to us > by land, and yet you cross the sea to serve China. Because of this, our > great country came to attack you. If you relinquish land to us and establish > a tributary relationship, everything will be all right. > > Seo: That is not so. Our country is in fact former Kogury≈è, and that is why > it is named Kory≈è and has a capital at P'y≈èngyang. If you want to discuss > territorial boundaries, the Eastern Capital of your country is within our > borders.... Moreover, the land on both sides of the Yalu River is also > within our borders, but the Jurchens have now stolen it.... If you tell us > to drive out the Jurchens, recover our former territory, construct > fortresses, and open the roads, then how could we dare not to have > [tributary] relations?\\" Seo reported to his king that he forged an agreement with Xiao to jointly \\"exterminate the Jurchens\\" and to seize their land so that Goryeo and Liao would have a closer land border and commensurate tributary relations. He lamented that the Jurchens would only allow Goryeo the land south of the Yalu River, but envisioned a future in which this situation of confinement would change. This story in which Seo Hui supposedly stemmed a \\"Chinese\\" invasion of \\"Korean\\" territory by referencing a past regime's occupation of the disputed territory has become popular in South Korea in recent years with the advent of the Northeast Project, which claimed the ancient state of Goguryeo (Kogury≈è, 37 BCE‚Äì668 CE) was part of the Chinese empire. The South Korean online activist group VANK, for example, has posted a video in 2012 calling on \\"young Koreans\\" to become \\"the next generation of Seo Hui\\", by turning \\"this crisis of the loss of Korean history into another opportunity\\" for Korean territorial expansion, as it argues was the result of Seo's rhetoric.Northeast Project  Seo Hui posted by prkorea (VANK) on YouTube on 11 March 2012 Later life and death Seo Hui died in 998, on the 14th day of the 7th lunar month (8 August 998).

He was a senator from 1916 to 1921 and was the fourth President of the University of the Philippines. Biography Palma was born in Manila on 24 October 1874 to Don Herm√≥genes Palma, a clerk at the Intendencia Office, and Hilaria Vel√°squez. His younger brother was the soldier-poet Jos√© Palma, the author of the Spanish poem Filipinas, which is, along with its subsequent translations, used in the Philippine National Anthem. In 1885, he began his studies at the Ateneo de Manila and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1892, he began his law studies at the University of Santo Tomas. While enrolled in the university, he was employed in the Office of the Bureau of Lands. He was also a reporter in La Independencia, the first Filipino daily newspaper, founded and directed by Antonio Luna. When Luna died in 1899, Palma assumed the paper's editorship. Aside from La Independencia, he was also involved in other papers, writing for La Patria, among others; and co-founding, along with Sergio Osme√±a and Jaime de Veyra, El Nievo Dia, the first daily newspaper in Cebu. In 1901, he passed the bar examinations. That same year, he founded the newspaper El Renacimiento which was first published on September 3. He married Carolina Ocampo in February 1902. He left the newspaper work in 1903 and practiced law while also teaching at the Escuela de Derecho. He started politics when he became a member and secretary of the Association of Peace. In the 1907 Philippine Assembly elections, he ran and subsequently won as an assemblyman representing the province of Cavite. On July 6, 1908, Governor-General James A. Smith appointed him as a member of the second Philippine Commission, becoming the youngest member to serve up to 1916. In the 1916 Philippine Senate elections, he was elected as Senator representing the 4th District. In September 1916, he was appointed by Governor-General Francis B. Harrison, through Executive Order No. 64, as Secretary of Interior and served until his resignation in July 1920. In July 1925, he was inaugurated as the fourth president of the University of the Philippines. He served as UP president up until 1933 when he resigned due to the Hare-Hawes-Cutting bill controversy wherein then-Senate President Manuel Quezon threatened to cut the university's appropriations due to Palma's championing of the law. He then again ran for Senator but lost to Juan Sumulong. In 1934, Palma was elected to the 1934 Constitutional Convention. In the later years of his life, Palma was appointed by President Quezon as Chairman of the National Board of Education. He held that position until his death in Manila on May 24, 1939 at the age of 64.

Career summary  Harry Bastable's was a novice at the Alan Hunt 1949 winter training school when he was signed up by Cradley Heath Heathens. For experience he was loaned to the 3rd Division National League Tamworth Hounds speedway club for the 1950 season, with occasional rides at reserve for 2nd Division Cradley. He returned full-time to Cradley Heath in 1951 and in 1952 was the Heathens' top scorer. Following the closure of speedway at Dudley Wood at the end of 1952 the Cradley team amalgamated with 3rd Division neighbours Wolverhampton Wasps to operate in the National League 2nd Division in 1953, but Harry Bastable never liked the track and didn't show his Cradley form, moving to Birmingham Brummies in August of that year where First Division racing proved hard going. In 1957 Birmingham closed mid-season following the track fatality of Harry's mentor and Brummies skipper Alan Hunt and the ensuing 'South African Affair.' He then transferred to Leicester to ride for the Leicester Hunters, where he initially found a new lease of life. After much badgering he shocked no one when in 1960 he left the Hunters mid- season to return to ride for his first love, Cradley Heath Heathens as their skipper in the newly formed lower level Provincial League, where he finished his racing career. A highlight of that career was when Harry and Cradley partner Ivor Brown, became the top two points scorers in the 1961 Provincial League.\\"British Speedway Leagues, 1946-1964\\", Peter Morrish, publ'd by Midland Speedway Agency Although announcing his retirement at the end of 1964, Harry Bastable was recalled to make 16 further appearances for the Heathens at senior level racing in the new British League of 1965 to cover for injuries at Cradley, before fully retiring from riding in that same year. He started a motor-cycle business \\"Speedaway Motors\\" in Blackheath, West Midlands, (later to be joined by his son Steve Bastable, who like his father before him rode as another Cradley number one.) In 1973 Harry turned to the management side of speedway, to become the manager of the Cradley Heath team, whom he renamed 'Cradley United'.Lawson,K (2018) ‚ÄúRiders, Teams and Stadiums‚Äù.

He was appointed President & Chief Executive Officer by the US Department of Treasury and AIG Board of Directors to succeed Edward M. Liddy. Benmosche is best known for his leadership at AIG, where he led a turnaround, improved profits 60% year over year, and paid down government aid pledged by the Bush and Obama Administrations. Early life Benmosche was born in Brooklyn, New York. Benmosche traced his Jewish lineage back to Lithuania, where his great-grandfather, Moshe Kreiskol, was one of the first Jews to serve in the tsar's army in the 1830s. Benmosche's grandfather, Rabbi Herman Benmosche moved the family to the US in 1894. Benmosche's father died when Benmosche was 10 years old. His estate included a newly constructed motel in the Borscht Belt‚Äîthe small towns in the Catskills where New York City Jews summered; and $250,000 debt. The family kept the motel. Benmosche himself took a series of jobs, working there, caddying, and later, driving a delivery truck. He graduated from New York Military Academy in 1962, and from Alfred University in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics. From 1966 to 1968, Benmosche served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, serving a tour of duty in Korea in the U.S. Signal Corps where he led the setup of field communications. Career Benmosche began his career when he joined Arthur D. Little and Information Science as a consultant. In 1975, Benmosche joined the Chase Manhattan systems group. In 1982, Benmosche joined Paine Webber to lead the development of Paine Webber's Central Asset Brokerage Account. During his 14-year tenure at Paine Webber, Benmosche gained experience in marketing and operations in different business units, using the knowledge he gained to become Chief Financial Officer of the company's retail business. As his career progressed at Paine Webber, Benmosche continued to gain new responsibilities, eventually earning a promotion to the position of Executive Vice President and Director of Operations, Administration and Technology. In that role, he oversaw the merger of Kidder Peabody's operations and systems with those of Paine Webber. =MetLife= Benmosche left Paine Webber to join the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1995. He was later promoted to president and Chief Operating Officer, and in November 1997 in his role as COO, oversaw individual and institutional as well as international insurance operations. In 1998 he was named Chairman of the Board and CEO. He retired in 2006. During his tenure, he oversaw MetLife's successful transition from mutual company to publicly traded firm. After being a member of the board of Credit Suisse AG for eleven years, Benmosche retired in April 2013. =Lafayette Theatre= In 2001, Benmosche purchased the 1923 Lafayette Theatre in his hometown of Suffern, New York, and successfully led its historic preservation effort. =Innkeeper and vintner= Benmosche owned Villa Splendid in Dubrovnik, Croatia. In 2001, Benmosche bought the one-time discoth√®que and spent the next six years renovating it. In 2006, Benmosche purchased land and imported 1500 Zinfandel plants from Napa Valley, California. In 2011, Benmosche's vineyard produced 3,000 bottles of wine under The Benmosche Family Dingac label. =AIG turnaround= In mid-2009, Benmosche was appointed CEO of American International Group. He assumed that role on August 10 of that year. He was recruited by Jim Millstein who was Chief Restructuring Officer at the US Department of Treasury. During his first meeting with employees, Benmosche stated that Congress was composed of \\"crazies,\\" that he would not cooperate if asked to testify before Congress, and that New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who had investigated AIG, \\"doesn't deserve to be in government.\\" He later asked for a personal private jet and said that he might quit over government-imposed pay restrictions. In 2010, Benmosche testified to the Congressional Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Oversight Panel, on May 26 [8], that AIG would repay the U.S. Government and American taxpayers‚Äô investment in AIG in full, with a profit. \\"AIG is now on a clear path to repaying taxpayers ... At the end of the day, the U.S. government will make an appropriate profit,\\" he testified. Benmosche oversaw the sale of non-core assets in AIG's portfolio to pay down the $182 billion in government aid. Business units such as American Life Insurance Company (Alico), American General Finance, 21st Century Insurance, Nan Shan and AIA were sold. On December 14, 2012, Benmosche announced that the U.S. government and American taxpayers received their full investment in AIG, plus a $22 billion positive return. Benmosche's management has been credited with leading the company back to profitability, the full repayment to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reducing the Treasury Department's stake in AIG to below 20% and the repayment of the 2008 $85 billion federal loan. =Illness= In 2010, Benmosche was diagnosed with lung cancer. He continued to work while also undergoing an aggressive oral chemotherapy regime. In an interview with Charlie Rose in December 2012, Benmosche said that he would stay at his current position for two more years. In August 2014, he accelerated the timetable of his retirement from AIG due to the progression of his cancer. Peter Hancock took over the role of CEO on September 1, 2014. Benmosche died on February 27, 2015, in Manhattan, aged 70.Obituary, nytimes.com; accessed February 28, 2015. =Controversy over bonuses= In September 2013, Benmosche gave an interview to The Wall Street Journal in which he compared public outrage over AIG bonuses to the lynching of African- Americans in the Deep South, saying \\"the uproar was intended to stir public anger, to get everybody out there with their pitch forks and their hangman nooses, and all that ‚Äì sort of like what we did in the Deep South [decades ago]. And I think it was just as bad and just as wrong.\\" This was seen as a reference to the $165 million in bonuses paid out in March 2009 to employees of AIG's \\"financial products\\" division, which sold the credit derivatives that put AIG deeply in debt after the Lehman Brothers collapse and compelled the Federal Reserve to bail out AIG with an $85 billion loan six months earlier, that eventually ballooned to $182.7 billion. His comments were labeled insensitive, offensive and tasteless by a number of commentators,AIG CEO causes outrage with comments comparing bonus criticism to lynching of blacks with Congressman Elijah Cummings calling for him to resign. Following the public outrage over the comments and Cummings' call, Benmosche apologized for the remarks two weeks later.AIG CEO Bob Benmosche apologizes for remarks that equated bonus criticism with lynchings of blacks Honors * Insurance and Technology magazine identified Benmosche as one of the insurance industry's \\"Tech-Savvy CEOs\\" in 2010. * Benmosche ranked 42nd in Fortune magazine's Top 50 Business Leaders of 2010. * The New York Times DealBook Andrew Ross Sorkin named Benmosche ‚Äú2010 Executive of the Year‚Äù. * Benmosche ranked #59 of Top 100 CEOs by Harvard Business Review, January 2010. * Insurance and Technology magazine named Benmosche 2011 ‚ÄúMover and Shaker‚Äù. * The New York Police & Fire Widows‚Äô & Children's Benefit Fund named Benmosche as an honoree in 2012. * 2013 winner Insurance Hall of Fame Past roles Benmosche's career included: * AIG, CEO, 2009‚Äì2014 * Metropolitan Life, CEO, 1998‚Äì2006 * Metropolitan Life, President, 1997‚Äì2004 * Metropolitan Life, EVP Individual Business, 1995‚Äì1997 * Paine Webber, EVP Southern Division Sales Group, 1994‚Äì1995 * Paine Webber EVP and Director of Operations, Administration and Technology, 1987‚Äì1994 * Paine Webber, CFO Retail Business, 1986‚Äì1987 * Paine Webber, Senior VP Marketing, 1982‚Äì1985 * Chase Manhattan Bank, VP Technology, 1975‚Äì1982 * Arthur D.

Location Catering almost exclusively for local traffic and located close to viaduct of the same name, in Ballure on the outskirts of Ramsey. Due to the nature of the tramway's construction, the cars can stop and drop off almost anywhere and will do so within reason. For this reason a great number of localised stopping places have built up since the line was completed, many at the intersection of farmer's crossings like this one. Naming Crossings like this usually take the name of nearby areas - in this case the valley and glen of the same name, but these unofficial halts never appear in timetable materials or have nameboards fitted to show their names. Many do however now carry bus stop-type signs attached to traction poles, and these were fitted in line with then- management policy in 1999. Terminus When the line first reached the northern town in 1899 this formed the terminus whilst the viaduct crossing the deep valley was constructed.

Traffic The halt caters almost exclusively for local traffic. Due to the nature of the tramway's construction, the cars can stop and drop off almost anywhere and will do so within reason. For this reason a great number of localised stopping places have built up since the line was completed, many at the intersection of smaller road crossings and the like. The crossings/halts usually take the name of the nearby farm or nearest road as is the case here, but these unofficial halts never appear in timetable materials or have nameboards fitted to show their names. Many do however now carry bus stop-type signs attached to traction poles, and these were fitted in line with then-management policy in 1999. Location The halt here is located on the only real \\"urban\\" stretch of the line and until relaid in 2002 featured the only grooved tramway rail on the line. Also along this section were different traction poles mounted to the side of the running lines (rather than between them as is characteristic on the rest of the line). These poles were more ornate and featured more decorative metalwork, but were replaced as part of an ongoing track renewal programme.

Life Hutchins was employed as Hudson's Bay Company surgeon at York Factory (Manitoba) 1766‚Äì1773 then Governor of Albany fort (Ontario) 1774‚Äì1782. By all accounts, he was a conscientious and hard-working physician but found time for research including a study of local edible plants useful for prevention of scurvy. He was visited 1768‚Äì1769 by astronomer William Wales, who had been sent by the Royal Society to observe the 1769 transit of Venus, and was left equipment and instructions for recording meteorological data. Encouraged by his acting chief Andrew Graham 1771‚Äì1772, he kept notes on wildlife, including descriptions of species not previously recorded. At the behest of the Royal Society, he made useful observations on magnetic declination at Albany 1775‚Äì1776. He performed preliminary experiments on the congelation (freezing point) of mercury in 1775, identifying the problem with previous attempts as being due to the abrupt change of volume of the mercury in the thermometer as it changed state. Apparatus for an improved method was devised and after a series of careful experiments 1779‚Äì1782, its freezing point was determined at ‚àí39 ¬∞F. For this work, highly praised by Cavendish, he was awarded the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1783, jointly with John Goodricke (for unrelated work). He served the Hudson's Bay Company for the rest of his life in London as corresponding secretary. It is probable that much of the nature notes for which he was also highly praised was actually the work of Andrew Graham, either generously given or plagiarised, an action not considered so reprehensible in those days. In 1784 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John McGowan, John Robison and Very Rev John Walker. He died on 7 July 1790.

Cattle grazing was re-introduced in 2009 to Lovell's Field to help prevent it becoming overgrown and rank. Trees have been cleared from the main part of the field in 2011 to prevent drying out and create attractive conditions for estuarine birds. A scrape was constructed at Lovell's Field in 2016 and a new pond dug at Leat Meadow in 2019. Both of these project were implemented to improve the variety of habitats on the reserve.

She is also a motivational speaker in the UK and internationally. Outen was the first woman and the youngest person to row solo across the Indian Ocean and also the Pacific Ocean from Japan to Alaska. She completed a round-the-world journey, mostly under her own power, by rowing boat, bicycle and kayak, on 3 November 2015. Education Outen attended Stamford High School before reading Biology at St Hugh's College, Oxford where she started rowing in 2004. Projects =Rowing solo across the Indian Ocean= After an eleven-day failed attempt which she dubbed her 'Warm Up Lap', Outen set out again from Fremantle, Western Australia, on 1 April 2009 in her 19ft boat called Serendipity. She rowed for 124 days, 14 hours and 9 minutes before arriving at Bois des Amourettes, on the island of Mauritius, on 3 August 2009. She was the first woman to attempt the crossing single-handedly, and only the fourth person to ever complete a solo crossing. She was also the youngest person and the first woman to row alone across the Indian Ocean. Her journey raised more than ¬£30,000 for two charities, Arthritis Care and Arthritis Research Campaign. She dedicated the crossing to the memory of her father who died in 2006. She was elected Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society shortly afterwards and awarded three Guinness World Records for her crossing. =London2London: Via the World= On 1 April 2011, Outen set off on an expedition called \\"London2London: Via the World\\". This mostly solo loop of the planet included the first attempt by a woman to row across the north Pacific Ocean. She rowed, cycled and kayaked her way eastward from London around the world, sharing stories about the adventure and experience. The journey was scheduled to take 2.5 years to complete. During her expedition, she cycled across Europe and Asia, rowed across the north Pacific, and cycled across parts of the United States and Canada to Cape Cod, before rowing across the North Atlantic to the UK. In the spring of 2012, during her first attempt on the Pacific leg, her vessel Gulliver was damaged in a storm and she had to be rescued. After several months spent recovering, she restarted her journey in Japan aboard a new seven-metre vessel named Happy Socks. As of 19 June 2013, she had achieved 1097 nautical miles on her row across the Pacific. She communicated about her trip using a satellite phone, filing periodic \\"phonecasts\\" from her boat. On 23 September 2013, after 150 days and 3,750 miles at sea,http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/more-sports/sarah-outen- rows-boat-into-history-books-becoming-first-woman-to-row-solo-across-north- pacific-ocean/story-fni2frsp-1226726522082 Outen became the first woman to row solo from Japan to Alaska as well as the first woman to complete a mid-Pacific row from West to East. She arrived at Adak Island in the Aleutian Islands, rowing to within half a mile of a rocky coastline before being towed through the channel between Adak and Kagalaska Island. She was originally bound for Canada, but punishing currents and inclement weather forced her to change destinations for Alaska. Arriving in New York In May 2014 she returned to Adak and kayaked 2500km along the Aleutian island chain and Alaskan Peninsula with Justine Curgenven, to the nearest road in Homer. There is no documentation of anyone else completing this journey in modern times, which involved many long crossings in uncharted waters with strong currents of unknown strength and direction. It took 101 days. From Homer, she got back on her bike and cycled through the Winter to the East coast of America. In September 2014 she crossed the border into Canada, arrived in New York on 12 March 2015, and left Cape Cod on 14 May. On 5 July she reported that a wave had torn off the rudder of her rowboat. On 6 October, having been at sea for 143 days but beset by Hurricane Joaquin, she abandoned the Atlantic crossing. She completed the journey at Tower Bridge in London on 3 November 2015. Honours She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society following her successful Indian Ocean crossing in 2009. Outen was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to rowing, conservation and charity. In 2016 the University of Leicester awarded her an honorary Doctor of Laws. Publishing Her first book A Dip in the Ocean: Rowing Solo Across The Indian Ocean was published by Summersdale on 7 February 2011. Her second book Dare to Do: Taking on the planet by bike and boat, which follows her London2London expedition, was published by Nicholas Brealey Publishing on 1 November 2016. Personal life During her crossing of the North Pacific Ocean Outen proposed to her long term girlfriend Lucy. Lucy later joined Outen for part of the cycle across North America.

The season officially ran from November 1, 2003 to April 30, 2004 with the first disturbance of the season forming on December 4 and the last disturbance dissipating on April 23.An average season has nine tropical cyclones, about half of which become severe tropical cyclones.RSMC Nadi warns on systems in the South Pacific which is located from the equator to 25¬∞S and from 160¬∞E to 120¬∞W. TCWC Wellington warns on systems from 25¬∞S to 40¬∞S and from 160¬∞E to 120¬∞W This is the period of the year when most tropical cyclones form within the South Pacific Ocean. During the season at least 16 people were killed from tropical disturbances whilst overall damage was estimated at $ (2004 USD; $ USD). The most damaging tropical disturbance was Cyclone Heta which caused at least $ (2004 USD; $ USD) in damage to six different countries and left three dead. The deadliest tropical disturbance of the season was Tropical Depression 10F, which was responsible for eleven deaths and caused $ (2004 USD; $ USD) in damage. Cyclone Ivy also caused 2 deaths and caused $ (2004 USD; $ USD) worth of damage to Vanuatu. As a result of the impacts caused by Heta and Ivy, the names were retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists. Within the South Pacific, tropical cyclones are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the South Pacific. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the South Pacific, designating tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. This timeline includes information from post-storm reviews by RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and the JTWC. It documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. Reports among warning centers often differ; as such, information from all three agencies has been included.

These terranes are long and narrow like the Zambales ophiolites which is at least 400 km long and 50 km wide. The strips generally run north‚Äìsouth and the zones of convergence are usually demarcated by fault lines. The Philippine Mobile Belt is compressed on the west by the Eurasian Plate and two arms of the Sunda Plate, and on the east by the Philippine Sea Plate. These tectonic plates have compressed and lifted parts of the Philippines causing extensive faulting, primarily on a north‚Äìsouth axis. All faults in the Philippines are inter-related by the tectonic forces of the Philippine Mobile Belt, or its tectonic induced volcanism. A more complete understanding can be gained by viewing the faults in the Philippines as an inter-related Philippine Fault System.  Philippine Fault Zone  The Philippine Fault Zone (PFZ) extends 1200 km across the Philippine archipelago behind the convergent boundary of the Philippine Trench and the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate.Aurelio, M., 2000. Shear partitioning in the Philippines: Constraints from Philippine Fault and global positioning system data. The Island Arc 9. This left-lateral strike-slip fault extends NW-SE (N30 ‚Äì 40 W) accommodating the lateral oblique motion of the subducting Philippine Sea Plate with respect to the Philippine Trench.Besana, G.M., Ando, M., 2005. The central Philippine Fault Zone: Location of great earthquakes, slow events, and creep activity. Earth Planets Science 57, 987‚Äì994. It extends from Davao Gulf in the south, bisects the Caraga region at the Agusan River basin, crosses to Leyte and Masbate islands, and traverses Quezon province in eastern Luzon before passing through Nueva Ecija up to the Ilocos region in northwest Luzon. The northern and southern extensions of the PFZ are characterized by branching faults due to brittle terminations. These horsetail faults are indicative of the lateral propagation and further development of the PFZ. The fault's current activity can be observed in Holocene sandstone outcrops on the Mati and Davao Oriental islands.Yumul, G., Dimalanta, C., Maglambayan, V., Marquez, E., 2008. Tectonic setting of a composite terrane: A review of the Philippine island arc system. Geosciences Journal 12, 7‚Äì17. The fault experiences a slip rate of approximately 2-2.5 cm/year.Barrier, E., Huchon, P., Aurelio, M., 1991. Philippine fault: A key for Philippine kinematics. Geology 19, 32‚Äì35.  Formation  It is proposed that the Philippine Trench and PFZ represent a ‚Äòshear partitioning‚Äô mechanism, where the oblique physical motions of subduction at the convergent zone resulted in the development of the major strike-slip fault. In the Philippine Sea, the oblique motion of the subducting Philippine Sea Plate resulted in the formation of the Philippine trench and the PFZ back arc fault system. The oblique motion is accommodated by two vector components; one vector perpendicular to the converging Philippine Trench and one vector parallel to the PFZ. Approximately 30% of the oblique motion is accommodated by the PFZ while the remaining proportions are displaced along other regional tectonic features as the Philippine Sea Plate currently subducts below the Philippine archipelago at a rate of 6‚Äì8 cm/year. These two tectonic features thus correlate to a similar time of development. The formation of the PFZ was a result of two stages. The first stage began at ~10 Ma, when the northern segments of the PFZ developed due to the convergence of the China Sea Crust underneath the nearby Manila Trench. The lack of accretionary prism at the Philippine Trench is suggestive of young origin correlating to an early second stage of development (2‚Äì4 Ma) with the central PFZ proposed to have developed between 2.7 and 3.8 Ma.  Earthquakes  The central Philippine Fault Zone consisting of the Guinayangan, Masbate, and Central Leyte faults are the most seismically active regions transecting the islands of Bondoc to Leyte. The northern and southern extensions of the Philippine Fault Zone experience infrequent earthquakes and often described as locked segments which are capable of larger magnitude earthquakes. The largest (M7.0) and most destructive earthquakes are generated along the Guinayangan fault every 30‚Äì100 years with slip rates of 20‚Äì33 mm/year as determined by GPS and historical records. Moderate earthquakes (M3.0‚Äì5.0) are observed along the Masbate fault with frequent aftershocks indicative of continued displacement and regional slip of 5‚Äì35 mm/year. The northern and southern segments of the Central Leyte fault experiences different seismic activity dependent on regional geology. While the Southern Central Leyte fault experiences moderate seismic events, the Northern Central Leyte fault creeps at approximately 25 mm/year. Historical data on the PFZ is limited due to the faults geographical location predominantly offshore, lack of complete paleoseismic data and lack of permanent Global Positioning System (GPS) that can trace movements over long periods of time. Other active fault systems * Valley Fault System * Macolod Corridor ‚Äì broad left-lateral fracture zone. * Lubang-Verde Passage Fault System ‚Äì located offshore between Batangas peninsula and Mindoro Island, following the northwest‚Äìsoutheast alignment of Verde and Lubang islands (thus the name) and essentially strike-slip (left-lateral) fault. * Mindoro/Aglubang Fault ‚Äì break in slope between mountainous western Mindoro and the flat lands of eastern. * Sibuyan Sea Fault ‚Äì located offshore north of Masbate; using bathymetric (SeaMarc) and paleomagnetic data gathered in the northern section of the Sibuyan Sea, Sarewitz and Lewis (1991) were led to conclude that the Sibuyan Sea Fault is relayed with the Verde Passage Fault, both left-lateral faults, by an aborted spreading center under a transtensional tectonic regime. * Legaspi Lineament ‚Äì long SE-trending linear feature emanating from Pasacao in the Ragay Gulf area, passing through Lake Bato then to Legaspi City and considering its morphological prominence and seismic activity, it deserves to be elevated in category from a less significant lineament to a fault. * Tablas Lineament ‚Äì tectonic boundary between the North Palawan microcontinental block and the western edge of the Philippine Mobile Belt. It trends northerly as it separates Busuanga peninsula from the Antique Range in Panay Island, and passes offshore northwards east of Tablas Island. The present geodynamic setting of the Philippines obliges the Tablas Lineament to operate as a right- lateral strike-slip fault. Its structure appears to connect with the Negros Trench southwards. * Mindanao Fault ‚Äì a prominent NW-trending linear fracture zone on the western third of Mindanao Island and has 2 distinct segments, including that which separates the Daguma Range from the Cotabato Basin corresponding to the Cotabato Fault segment. This segment is highly linear and has features suggestive of normal faulting although it may have been a left lateral strike slip fault during its early history. The Quaternary Mt. Parker volcano is located at the western end of this fault and, on radar images, seems to be cut by the fault and terraces formed by Quaternary limestone mark the Daguma Range. These, together with the young morphology of incised river valleys, suggests a young age for the fault along which the Daguma Range was uplifted. Although Quaternary in age, it still has to be ascertained whether the fault is active or not (Quebral, 1994). The Sindangan Fault segment represents the northern continuation of the fault towards northern Zamboanga. Focal mechanism solutions of earthquakes offshore and narrow shear zones transecting recent gravel deposits suggest active left-lateral faulting (Pubellier and others, 1991). * Offshore Cebu-Bohol faults (?) ‚Äì occasional occurrence of low to moderate magnitude, shallow-seated earthquakes between Cebu and Bohol, some capable of causing significant damage to infrastructure, is the subject of current discussions on the possible existence of active faults in the region. Such earthquake generators are most likely offshore, as there have so far been no indications of active faulting within the islands of Cebu and Bohol. Active fault studies are spearheaded by PHIVOLCS.

Created in 2000, the Foundation seeks to help build cultural bridges between Turkey and other countries in order to support a better understanding and appreciation of Turkish cultural heritage. To do this, the Foundation coordinates a series of people-to-people cultural exchanges, educational programs, and websites promoting Turkish music, art, and cuisine. As a US tax-exempt public charitable organization, the Foundation is supported entirely by private donations and has offices in Boston, Istanbul, Sonoma and Washington, DC. Projects =Promoting Turkish culture on the Web= The Turkish Cultural Foundation contributes to the worldwide promotion of Turkish culture via its three main educational websites. The TCF portals received over 1.7 million visitors from 204 countries and territories in 2010. The Foundation's Turkish Culture Portal highlights some of the distinct characteristics and qualities of Turkish culture and its contributions to human work. The website is intended as a casual and entertaining walk through topics related to Turkey's rich culture. Its content will always be a work in progress given the depth and the multiple dimensions of the subject. Likewise, the Foundation's Turkish Music Portal is the first public educational website dedicated to Turkish music and was inaugurated in January 2006. The Turkish Music Portal explores the history, reviews the instruments of Turkish classical folk music, and introduces the composers and performers of all types of Turkish. It is available in Turkish, English, French and German. Similarly, the Foundation's Turkish Cuisine Portal is a rich resource featuring the many different aspects of Turkey's diverse culinary culture, including history, sociology, believes, ingredients, techniques, and recipes. For those who want to bring a piece of Turkish culture home, the Foundation's Turkish Culture Shop promotes Turkey's diverse and unique cultural and artistic products, as well as providing access to a sampling of Turkish food items. All proceeds from sales go toward projects, scholarships and gifts. Available for online purchase are books, music gourmet products, handicrafts and art work. In 2010, the Foundation established a portal for the TCF Natural Dye Research and Development Laboratory ‚Äì DATU. The DATU portal, in addition to providing information on the institutional work of this new TCF initiative, makes a wealth of scientific knowledge on natural dyes available to the public. The portal also features an expansive database and images of plants, insects and other material used in the generation of natural dyes. =Educational projects= In order to promote interaction between the Turkish and American peoples, the Turkish Cultural Foundation has developed programs that encourage personal exchanges among different levels of society. One such program is the Foundation's series of Teacher Study Tours to Turkey. As a partner of the World Affairs Councils of America, the Turkish Cultural Foundation organized 13 study tours to Turkey for 348 educators from 2007 to 2011. The study tours are part of a program with 18 World Affairs Council chapters nationwide and the Birmingham International Center, made possible through a grant by the Turkish Cultural Foundation, to educate teachers and the general public about Turkey. As part of this program, TCF has sponsored and helped organize 20 workshops for 638 teachers representing 241 schools. Since 2007, over 2000 American teachers have participated in the Teacher Workshops on Turkey program. Additionally, the TCF-World Affairs Council partnership features public educational programs entitled Portrait of Turkey, designed and organized by the participating councils, Teacher Study Tours alumni, and TCF. The programs feature cultural events, such as book readings, festivals, and art exhibits. Since 2010, The Turkish Cultural Foundation has been awarding major grants to the Birmingham International Center (BIC) in support of its Spotlight on Turkey series of programs. One such program is BIC's Arts in Education program, which provides resources to Alabama schools to incorporate Turkish art and culture into their curricula. To help increase awareness of the artistic and cultural heritage of Turkey while also expanding recognition and outreach to Turkish artists worldwide, the Foundation initiated the \\"Who‚Äôs Who in Turkish Culture and Art\\" project, an online database of Turkish artists, artisans, and cultural experts in Turkey and around the world. The database covers artists from numerous categories, including visual and applied arts, traditional Turkish art, literature, music, theater, cinema, documentaries, dance, ballet, and opera. Likewise, the Foundation pioneered the showcasing of modern Turkish art at SOFA exhibitions in Chicago and New York. In addition, the Foundation supports direct interaction of Turkish museum administrators, artists, intellectuals, and community members by hosting visiting art fellowships, lectures series in Istanbul and the U.S., and major Turkish festivals held in Boston, Chicago, Houston, Monterey, New York, Seattle, and Washington, DC. =Cultural and historical preservation projects= To help preserve hundreds of years of art, the Foundation created the Image Archival of Turkish Art, a digitalized slide repository of over 12,000 images of art. The archive was created from the professional image collection of Prof. Dr. Nurhan Atasoy, Art Historian and Senior Resident Scholar at the Turkish Cultural Foundation. Searchable in English and Turkish, the Image Archive of Turkish Art is accessible, for free, from the TCF Turkish Culture Portal. In 2011, TCF established the YESAM Culinary Arts Center. Located at ARMAGGAN Nuruosmaniye, the mission of YESAM is to research, document and revive the tangible and intangible culinary heritage and traditions created by the Turkish people over the centuries on the expansive geographies they inhabited. YESAM will develop theoretical and practical educational methods to promote Turkish culinary culture in Turkey and across the world with a view to preserve this heritage for future generations. YESAM incorporates three conference rooms, a show kitchen and library. The show kitchen is designed for visitors to observe YESAM cooks preparing traditional Turkish dishes and desserts and is open to individual visits, as well as culinary tours. Having identified shadow puppet theater ‚Äì Karag√∂z - as one the vanishing Turkish traditional art forms, the Turkish Cultural Foundation undertook the staging and filming of 20 traditional Karagoz plays, as performed by master puppeteer Metin √ñzlen. The project culminated in the release of \\"Turkish Traditional Shadow Theater: Karag√∂z,\\" a 5-DVD collection to preserve this traditional Turkish art form for generations to come. In 2007, the Turkish Cultural Foundation was the lead sponsor of the XI. International Conference on Oriental Carpets (ICOC). The Foundation's sponsorship enabled the preservation and restoration of 118 antique carpets and their exhibition during the conference. The Turkish Cultural Foundation has underwritten the creation of a database of Iron Age settlements in Turkey, as well as a database for the Seljuk Age cultural and architectural sites. Both projects have been developed and implemented by Turkish non-governmental organizations TAY Project and Foundation for the Advancement of Turkish Cultural Awareness, and are managed by teams of scholars. As part of the sustainable development project undertaken by the Global Heritage Fund, the Foundation was a major sponsor of the restoration of the Namƒ±k Kemal House and Cultural Center in the Eastern Turkish city of Kars. Additionally, the Foundation sponsored the excavation and preservation project at the Neolithic site of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Central Turkey. Dating back some 9,000 years, √áatalh√∂y√ºk is home to the world's earliest mural arts and is pivotal to understanding the origin of civilizations.

It stars Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, and Carice van Houten. Despite not being credited as a writer, Smith made very significant changes in the second half of the script, including a new ending. All the scenes of Black Death were shot in chronological order, a rare occurrence. Plot In 1348 in a plague-ridden medieval England, novice monk Osmund has a secret relationship with a young woman named Averill who has taken sanctuary in his monastery. When the disease strikes the monastery, Averill departs at Osmund's urging, but promises to wait one week for Osmund at a nearby forest. Osmund prays for a sign from God to leave the monastery and reunite with Averill. Shortly afterwards, Ulric, an envoy for the regional bishop, arrives at the monastery seeking a guide through the forest to reach a remote marshland village untouched by the plague. Taking Ulric's arrival as the sign to leave, Osmund volunteers to serve as the guide and joins his group, which consists of soldiers Wolfstan, Griff, Dalywag, Mold, Ivo, and Swire. The group informs Osmund that the village is believed to be led by a necromancer, who they intend to deliver to the bishop for trial and execution. The journey to the village leads to the deaths of Griff and Ivo, while Osmund finds Averill's blood-stained clothing and believes she has died. Eventually reaching their destination, the group are met by Hob and Langiva, the village's leaders. Aware of the group's intentions, the villagers drug the soldiers, while Osmund learns that Averill's body is in the village and witnesses Langiva seemingly resurrect her. The members of the group are bound and placed in a water-filled pit where Hob and Langiva offer freedom to those who will renounce God. When the group refuses, Dalywag is crucified and disemboweled. The sight causes Swire to renounce his faith, only for the villagers to hang him in the woods. Afterwards, Osmund is brought to the apparently-resurrected Averill and believing her to be in a state of suffering, stabs her to save her soul. Ulric is then taken from the pit to be drawn and quartered by horses, but before the villagers execute him, he reveals that he is afflicted by the plague and has brought it to the village. With the villagers distracted by this revelation, Wolfstan and Mold are able to free themselves with a knife Osmund snuck by the pit and fight back. Hob kills Mold, but is incapacitated by Wolfstan and placed in the device for transporting the necromancer. Osmund pursues Langiva to the swamp, where she tells him that she is not a witch and Averill did not die in the forest. Instead, Averill had been drugged and her apparent resurrection was an act; her actual death was caused by Osmund stabbing her. Broken by this information, Osmund is unable to prevent Langiva from escaping. Wolfstan, deeming the mission to be completed, returns Osmund to the monastery, with Hob to be delivered to the bishop. In the following years, the village becomes afflicted by the plague while Wolfstan loses contact with Osmund, but hears rumours of him becoming cold and cruel as he dedicates himself to finding and punishing Langiva. Cast Production Black Death was developed and produced by Douglas Rae and Robert Bernstein at London's Ecosse Films, with Phil Robertson of Zephyr Films acting as physical producer. Ultimately it could not get off the ground in the UK and became a 100% German production. The film was financed solely from Germany, with Jens Meurer of Egoli Tossell Films acting as producer. The film was originally due to be directed by Geoffrey Sax. Rupert Friend and Lena Headey were attached to star. Famke Janssen was later considered for Headey's role. After he was attached to direct Black Death, Smith suggested Carice van Houten, Tim McInnerny, and John Lynch for their respective roles. The film was shot in the German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt at Blankenburg Castle in the city of Blankenburg and in Querfurt and Zehdenick, Brandenburg in the first half of 2009. Van Houten's first day on set was 14 May 2009. Technical elements included production design by John Frankish, a spartan score by composer Christian Henson, and cinematography by Sebastian Edschmid.http://horrormoviesreviews.wordpress.com/ =Smith's approach to the film and script changes= Smith explained his approach to the film: In the original script, the second half of the film turned to be entirely supernatural: Langiva was revealed to be the reincarnation of the Devil, while Osmund \\"was actually in Hell and Hell being in the physical place\\". Smith changed these elements to represent the idea that to him \\"Hell is the Hell you are in within yourself\\", as he tried to represent in Triangle. Because it was considered too dark, producers tried to cut Smith's ending from the shooting schedule. However they changed their minds two days before the shootings of the epilogue. Release International sales were handled by HanWay Films. Amongst other deals, Revolver Entertainment/Sony acquired the rights for the UK and planned a release on 28 May 2010, while Wild Bunch distributed the film in Germany. The film is part of the Canadian Fantasia 2010. Reception Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes provides links to 59 reviews of the film, 68% of which are positive. The critical consensus states: \\"Black Death delivers the fire and brimstone violence its subject matter warrants, while posing some interesting questions of faith and religion.\\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_death-2010/ In an advance review, Leslie Felperin of Variety wrote \\"A savvy, stylish horror- actioner that's more than the sum of its genre parts, Black Death manages to deliver enough suspense and bloodletting to appease gore fans... Use of grainy stock and a preference for special effects rather than visual or CGI effects gives it a pleasingly retro feel, as does its willingness to explore uncomfortable moral ambiguities. Tech credits create a strong, fetid atmosphere on what looks like a low budget. German locations in Saxony look appropriately beautiful, sinister and ancient all at the same time.\\" Alan Jones from Film4's FrightFest concluded: \\"Some may find the climax rather disconcerting as Smith pulls the rug from under one‚Äôs feet. However, the greater percentage will thrill to the way the eerie and puzzling intensity builds up a compelling head of scream as the stark brand of Witchfinder General shock value rears its head in the most startling of codas. This intelligent original represents a commendable break from the genre norm and is one of the most powerful films made about God, the godless and what the Devil truly represents.\\" See also * List of historical drama films References External links    Interview with Dario Poloni Category:2010 films Category:2010 horror films Category:2010s adventure films Category:Black Death in fiction Category:German films Category:German adventure films Category:German horror films Category:Gothic horror films Category:British films Category:Folk horror films Category:British adventure films Category:British horror films Category:Horror adventure films Category:English-language films Category:Latin-language films Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in the 14th century Category:Films shot in Germany Category:Films directed by Christopher Smith ","title":"Black Death (film)"},{"id":"23887070","text":"is a junior college in Sakai-ku, Sakai Sakai, Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan.

Animal welfare laws in many states of the United States make it a crime to abandon a pet. The UK passed the Abandonment of Animals Act 1960 which describes the offence of cruelty as \\"If any person being the owner or having charge or control of any animal shall without reasonable cause or excuse abandon it, whether permanently or not, in circumstances likely to cause the animal any unnecessary suffering, or cause or procure or, being the owner, permit it to be so abandoned.\\" Often, when abandoned, pets are forced to fend for themselves and become stray or feral. Feral cats are said to outnumber feral dogs and can become challenging to handle and socialize enough to be re-introduced to a new human owner. In general, only some newly abandoned cats and very young feral kittens can be tamed. There is a necessity to investigate interventions to prevent companion-animal relinquishment. Stray animals increase potential exposure to zoonotic diseases like rabies. Cat bites or scratches involving stray or feral animals are eight times more common than dog bites. Some pets relinquished to an animal shelter will be euthanized due to a lack of space or financial resources. Millions of companion animals enter animal shelters every year in the United States. However, the number of dogs and cats euthanized in US shelters declined from approximately 2.6 million in 2011 to 1.5 million in 2018. This decline can be partially explained by an increase in the percentage of animals adopted, and an increase in the number of stray animals successfully returned to their owners. Studies show that the majority of people who relinquish an animal also report being emotionally attached to the dog. It has been reported that when forced to abandon their animals in an evacuation, people suffer mental issues such as grief, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Recognizing the importance of pets to their owners and their role in public health is an essential first step in improving a public health problem that has been seen repeatedly in the past and is unlikely to change in the future. Pet abandonment increased during the USA financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. In early 2009, the ASPCA published advice for people facing foreclosure and the loss of their pets, recommending finding a foster or adoption situation for your pet, being aware of rental property rules for pets, and checking with animal shelters and animal rescue groups.

The faction was formally established on April 8, 1930, and an Associated Press report published in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times April 7, 1930, describes it as having been briefly named \\"The Church of Jesus Christ\\" and later, the \\"Church of Christ\\". It is informally referred to as the \\"Church of Christ (Fettingite)\\", after its founder, Otto Fetting, but this sect has never officially been named as such. Otto Fetting, an Apostle in the Church of Christ, was the alleged recipient of a series of messages delivered by John the Baptist concerning construction of a temple on the Temple Lot, along with other aspects of Hedrickite doctrine and practice. The rejection of his \\"Twelfth Message\\" by a majority vote of his fellow Apostles in October 1929 led to a split in the Temple Lot organization between those who rejected Fetting's messages and those who accepted them. The \\"Fettingites\\" subsequently established their own church organization. While Fettingite doctrine and practices are virtually identical to those of the Church of Christ, a significant difference exists today in the acceptance of the messages' authenticity between Hedrickites and Fettingites. The Hedrickite leadership voted at their April, 1936 conference to formally reject Otto Fetting's claim of having heard from John the Baptist, but some laity in the Hedrickite sect have informally expressed interest or belief in his claims, to where about a half-dozen Hedrickites today believe Fetting received some or all of the revelations he claimed. After its founder's death in 1933, the Fettingite sect further divided into various factions, including The Church of Christ (Restored), the Church of Christ at Halley's Bluff, and the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message. As with the Church of Christ, each of these groups declares itself to be the \\"only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth.\\" Otto Fetting =Entry into the Temple Lot church= Otto Fetting on April 6, 1929 praying at a groundbreaking ceremony for a proposed Temple. Otto Fetting was born on 20 November 1871 in Casco, St. Clair County, Michigan. Making his home in Port Huron, Michigan, he was baptised into the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on February 9, 1891, and ordained a High Priest on February 15, 1899. In 1925, disgruntled by the Supreme Directional Control controversy within the RLDS church, Fetting switched his allegiance to the Temple Lot organization. At the time, this did not require rebaptism or reordination, as each group accepted the priesthood and sacraments of the other. In the spring of 1926, he was among seven men ordained to be Apostles in the Church of Christ. =Visitation by John the Baptist= On February 4, 1927, Otto Fetting claimed that he had been visited by a so-called \\"resurrected angel\\" clothed in 20th-century garb, who delivered a message for him to give to the Temple Lot organization. In a second alleged visitation one month later, the being identified himself as John the Baptist. The \\"angel\\"'s messages advised construction of the long-awaited Temple in Independence, Missouri, first foretold by Latter-Day Saint founder Joseph Smith in 1831 and 1832. The Temple Lot church had a long history of direction via revelation and angel visits and so was originally receptive to these alleged visits of the Biblical prophet, publishing Fetting's messages in their monthly periodical Zion's Advocate.\\" They also began work on the temple with a groundbreaking ceremony held on 6 April 1929. According to Fetting, the Hedrickites were given seven years to complete the structure. Fetting's \\"visitor\\" revealed various architectural details for the building and specifically directed surveyors to move their markers ten feet to the east of where they had originally been placed. The angel also revealed the location of two of Joseph Smith's original marker stones, which Smith had buried 98 years before to indicate the location for his planned temple. He also indicated that the \\"Articles of Faith and Practice\\" of the Temple Lot church were correct and should not be changed from their original form. In other occasions, the messenger indicated particular men to be ordained within the organization, including to its Quorum of Twelve Apostles. =The twelfth message= Although the Temple Lot organization had enthusiastically accepted the first eleven of Fetting's messages, this would not hold true for the twelfth. In verse four of this missive, John the Baptist states that all persons coming into the Church of Christ must be rebaptized, as \\"the Lord has rejected all creeds and factions of men\\". While this reflects the practice of the majority of Latter Day Saint denominations (including the Temple Lot church itself, today), it did not reflect the policy of the Temple Lot church at the time, which accepted members during this period from the Reorganized church, certain other Latter Day Saint organizations, and Joseph Smith's pre-1844 church on their original baptisms. This message equally declared Fetting to have been given the same \\"keys to the priesthood\\" that were given to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on May 15, 1829. Controversy over the meaning and application of Fetting's twelfth message became so great that he was \\"silenced\\" in October 1929 by the leading quorum of the Temple Lot church. Fetting was censured for alleged \\"arrogant\\" behavior by demanding that the church comply with his twelfth message. Choosing to withdraw rather than continue under such a restriction, Fetting led approximately half of the Church of Christ members (including some of its apostles) to found an organization of his own, which became known as the Church of Christ (Fettingite). Since the Temple Lot organization retained possession of the Temple Lot and its meetinghouse, Fetting's organization met in members' homes for a considerable period prior to building their own worship facilities. Fetting claimed to have been visited some thirty times by the \\"messenger\\" prior to his death on 30 January 1933. Subsequent history =William A. Draves= Four years after Fetting's death, a young Fettingite Elder named William A. Draves from Nucla, Colorado claimed that the same messenger who had appeared to Fetting had begun to appear to him as well, starting on October 4, 1937. While initially receptive to these new messages, the leadership of the existing Fettingite faction ultimately rejected all of them, leading to a split in 1943. Draves' adherents formed the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, which claims to be the sole legitimate continuance of Fetting's original organization. Draves himself claimed a total of ninety messages prior to his death on June 28, 1994; these were combined with Fetting's into a book entitled The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel. The original Fettingite faction continues to publish its own compendium of Fetting's revelations, simply entitled The Word of the Lord, containing only Fetting's thirty messages. This latter group is colloquially known as the \\"Thirty-message church.\\" =A.C. DeWolf and the Saturday Sabbath= While the main Fettingite organization in Missouri took some time to completely reject William Draves and his new \\"messages\\", branches of this church in Louisiana and Mississippi did not. Under the leadership of A.C. DeWolf, these Fettingites rejected Draves almost immediately, and formed their own church organization, the Church of Christ (Restored). This organization remained separated from the main Fettingite group even after the latter decided against Draves. During the 1950s, some leaders of the Fettingite church began to advocate keeping the Saturday Sabbath in lieu of Sunday. In 1956, the Fettingite Quorum of Twelve, under Apostle S.T. Bronson, formally instituted this change. The Church of Christ (Restored) refused to sanction this change, and claims that the Church of Christ (Fettingite) is in error for introducing it. Other than disagreeing as to the proper day for worship, the \\"Bronsonite\\" and \\"DeWolf\\" organizations remain virtually identical in doctrine and practice. Both of them accept Fetting's ministry and messages, but not Draves'. Each rejects the other, and considers itself the sole true continuation of Otto Fetting's church. Draves' organization, on the other hand, rejects both of these groups, accepting their founder's messages and those of Otto Fetting. The \\"Bronsonite\\" faction of the Fettingite church is said to have about 2000 members, while the Church of Christ (Restored) has approximately 450.Adherents.com Website. Doctrine and practices Other than their acceptance of Fetting's thirty \\"messages\\", the beliefs and practices of the Fettingite organizations are virtually identical to those of their parent church, the Church of Christ. In common with the Temple Lot church, Fettingites reject the office of President of the Church, being led instead by their Quorum of Twelve Apostles, with all members of that body considered equal. Also, like their Temple Lot cousins, the Fettingites reject the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, as well as Joseph Smith's Inspired Version of the Bible, preferring to use only the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon as doctrinal standards. Baptism for the Dead, eternal marriage, polygamy and the eternal progression doctrine are all rejected. Fettingites still believe that a temple will be reared on the Temple Lot, but it will not be like any of the LDS or Community of Christ temples currently in use. In verse 6 of his twelfth \\"message\\", Otto Fetting quoted John the Baptist as allegedly saying that Joseph Smith had indeed been a true prophet, but that he \\"sinned before God\\" due to \\"pride, and the love and praise of men\\". \\"Much of his work has been destroyed\\", wrote Fetting, \\"but he will be saved as by fire, and will be numbered with the prophets of old\\". Accordingly, Fettingites respect Joseph Smith as a prophet, but do not necessarily accept all of his teaching. In verse 1 of his first \\"message\\", Fetting's heavenly envoy commanded that the \\"Articles of Faith and Practice\\" of the Temple Lot organization (of which Fetting was then still an apostle) were to remain unchanged, \\"because the Lord inspired the men that wrote them\\". The Fettingite faction currently headquartered in Independence, sometimes referred to as the \\"Bronsonite\\" group, is Sabbatarian. The Church of Christ (Restored), also called the \\"De Wolf\\" group, is found mostly in Louisiana and Mississippi and observes Sunday as its day of worship, as does the Elijah Message church.

It is located on Curtis Island, which shelters the harbor from ocean storms. It was first established in 1835, and the present structure was built in 1896. The light was automated in 1972, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history Curtis Island is a teardrop-shaped island off Dillingham Point, which marks the southern end of Camden Harbor. The island is mostly wooded, with a cleared area at its southeastern end where the lighthouse is located. The light station complex consists of a circular brick tower, a 1-1/2 story wood frame keeper's house, a small brick oil house, and toolshed. The dock is located at the sheltered northwest end of the island, with a path (one of several on the island) connecting the two areas. The island was known as Negro Island until 1934, when it was renamed Curtis Island in honor of Cyrus H. K. Curtis, a publisher and philanthropist who was a frequent visitor. The light was authorized in 1835 and went into service in 1836. The present keeper's house was built in 1889, on the foundation of the original keeper's house, and the light tower was built in 1896. In addition to serving as a marker for the Camden Harbor entrance, the station also served as a signal tower for Bangor- bound ships. In 1970, a group of local citizens convinced the United States Coast Guard to turn the light over to the town, rather than auctioning it off. The island is now a town park. The light was automated in 1972, and the property is managed by a town-hired caretaker. Lighthouse at Camden, Maine, oil on canvas, by Fitz Hugh Lane, 1851.

C. DeWolf. This schism was provoked by a difference in opinion regarding a series of claimed \\"messages\\" received by William Draves, an elder in that church, following the death of founder Otto Fetting. Whereas the main Fettingite church initially chose to grant cautious acceptance to these missives, several Fettingite branches in Louisiana and Mississippi did not, and split from the main organization to form the Church of Christ (Restored). Even after the main Fettingite church chose to reject Draves and his messages in 1943 (leading Draves to leave and found his own sect, the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message), the DeWolf faction refused to reconcile with the main body, considering itself to be the sole legitimate continuation of the Fettingite church, and the only true church on earth today. Its membership is currently concentrated mostly in the American South, and stands at about 450 members. Otto Fetting Otto Fetting in 1916 =Entry into the Temple Lot church= Otto Fetting was born on 20 November 1871 in Casco, St. Clair County, Michigan. Making his home in Port Huron, Michigan, he was baptised into the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on February 9, 1891, and ordained to its priesthood in 1899. In 1925, dismayed by the \\"Supreme Directional Control\\" controversy within the RLDS church, Fetting switched his allegiance to the Temple Lot organization. At the time, this did not require re-baptism or re-ordination, as each group accepted the priesthood and sacraments of the other. In the spring of 1926, he was among seven men ordained to be Apostles in the Church of Christ. =Visitation by John the Baptist= On February 4 of 1927, Otto Fetting claimed that he had been visited by John the Baptist, who delivered a message for him to give to the Temple Lot organization. This message commanded construction of the long-awaited Temple in Independence, Missouri, first foretold by Latter Day Saint founder Joseph Smith in 1831. The Temple Lot church had a long history of direction via revelation and angel visits, and thus was originally receptive to these alleged visits of the Biblical prophet, publishing Fetting's messages in their monthly periodical Zion's Advocate. They also began work on the temple with a groundbreaking ceremony held on 6 April 1929. According to Fetting, the Hedrickites were given seven years to complete the structure. Fetting's \\"visitor\\" revealed various architectural details for the building, and specifically directed surveyors to move their markers ten feet to the east of where they had originally been placed. The angel also revealed the location of two of Joseph Smith's original marker stones, which Smith had buried 98 years before to indicate the location for his planned temple. He also indicated that the \\"Articles of Faith and Practice\\" of the Temple Lot church were correct, and should not be changed from their original form. On other occasions, the messenger indicated particular men to be ordained within the organization, including to its Quorum of Twelve Apostles. =The twelfth message= Although the Temple Lot organization had enthusiastically accepted the first eleven of Fetting's messages, this would not hold true for the twelfth. In verse four of this missive, John the Baptist states that all persons coming into the Church of Christ must be rebaptized, as \\"the Lord has rejected all creeds and factions of men\\". While this reflects the practice of the majority of Latter Day Saint denominations (including the Temple Lot church itself, today), it did not reflect the policy of the Temple Lot church at the time, which accepted members during this period from the Reorganized church, certain other Latter Day Saint organizations, and Joseph Smith's pre-1844 church on their original baptisms. This message equally declared Fetting to have been given the same \\"keys to the priesthood\\" that were given to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on May 15, 1829. Controversy over the meaning and application of Fetting's twelfth message became so great that Fetting himself was \\"silenced\\" in October 1929 by the Temple Lot organization. Choosing to withdraw rather than continue under such a restriction, Fetting led approximately half of the Church of Christ members (including some of its apostles) to found an organization of his own, which became known as the Church of Christ (Fettingite). Since the main Temple Lot organization retained possession of the Temple Lot and its meetinghouse, Fetting's organization met in members' homes for a considerable period prior to building their own worship facilities. Fetting would be visited a total of 30 times by his \\"messenger\\" prior to his death on 30 January 1933. Formation of the Church of Christ (Restored) Four years after Fetting's death, a young Fettingite Elder named William A. Draves from Nucla, Colorado claimed that the same messenger who had appeared to Fetting had begun to appear to him, as well. Initially, the main Fettingite branch in Independence, Missouri gave cautious acceptance to these new missives. However, branches of the Fettingite church in Louisiana and Mississippi did not, and chose to organize a separate church under the leadership of A. C. DeWolf sometime around 1937, which became the Church of Jesus Christ (Restored). This organization remains separated from the main Fettingite group even after the latter decided to reject Draves and his messages in 1943. Draves would go on to form his own church, the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message. When the Saturday Sabbath was introduced in the Church of Christ (Fettingite) in 1956, the Church of Christ (Restored) refused to sanction this move, and claims that the Church of Christ (Fettingite) is in error for introducing it. Other than disagreeing as to the proper day for worship, the \\"Bronsonite\\" and \\"DeWolf\\" organizations remain virtually identical in doctrine and practice. Both of them accept Fetting's ministry and messages, but not Draves'. Each rejects the other, and considers itself the sole true continuation of Otto Fetting's church. The Church of Christ (Restored) has approximately 450 members, while the \\"Bronsonite\\" faction is said to have about 2000.Adherents.com Website. Doctrine and practices Other than their rejection of the Saturday Sabbath, the beliefs and practices of the Church of Christ (Restored) are virtually identical to those of their parent church, the Church of Christ (Fettingite). In common with the Fettingite church, they reject the office of President of the Church, being led instead by their Quorum of Twelve Apostles, with all members of that body considered equal.

Early life Fleischhauer was born in Thamsbr√ºck, Bad Langensalza, Germany, the son of a Lutheran deacon. His career was at first grounded in the Imperial German Army where by 1918 Fleischhauer rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and regimental commander of a field artillery unit in Colmar. After suffering serious wounds, Fleischhauer retired from military service and received a government pension, although he continued to serve for some time as chairman of the National Federation of German Officers (Nationalverbandes Deutscher Offiziere). After the army, Fleischhauer sought out something else to do full- time. The draw of the public policy arena attracted him. In the aftermath of the defeat of the German and Austria-Hungarian empires, a number of new political parties emerged, many arguing for pan-Germanism. Fleischhauer joined the German National People's Party (Deutschnationale Volkspartei, or DNVP) and was a representative of the far right wing. Intellectually, Fleischhauer was a disciple of Theodor Fritsch and through their common V√∂lkisch movement circles he also developed friendships with a number of other revolutionary nationalists in secretive Aryan organizations such as the Thule Society. Fleischhauer was especially close to poet and political activist Dietrich Eckart, an early backer of Adolf Hitler. Entry into publishing These connections led Fleischhauer to create an anti-Jewish publishing firm called U. Bodung-Verlag in Erfurt, Germany that over time became increasingly powerful. Its rise in influence corresponded with the popular successes of National Socialism during the later Weimar period, leading up to the establishment of the Third Reich. On 1 December 1933, he founded Welt-Dienst or Weltdienst (World-Service, Service Mondial etc.) which served as an international antisemitic news agency and journalistic source for numerous other publications. For a nominal fee, subscribers to Welt-Dienst's twice monthly series of mimeographed information sheets received summaries of news stories and other developments worldwide which tended to discredit anyone and anything linked to Judaism and Jewish Bolshevism. Controversial Berne Trial expands Fleischhauer's influence Fleischhauer's influence grew in 1934-1935 following his participation in Switzerland as a key defense organizer at the Berne Trial of distributors of the book The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. This notorious title had re-entered the headlines in June 1933 when a Swiss organization known as the Nationale Front began distributing it during a right wing demonstration. In 1934, Dr. Alfred Zander, a Swiss Nazi, further inflamed public opinion by publishing a series of articles accepting The Protocols' description of a Jewish plot to take over the world as fact. Outraged, a group of leading Swiss Jews filed a lawsuit in the Amtsgericht (district court) of Bern on 29 October 1934 to censor The Protocols as \\"indecent writings\\" under a Bernese statute prohibiting the distribution of \\"immoral, obscene or brutalizing\\" texts. The plaintiffs were represented by Georges Brunschvig and Emil Raas. Vladimir Burtsev, a Russian √©migr√©, anti-Bolshevik and anti-Fascist who exposed numerous Okhrana agent provocateurs in the early 1900s, served as a witness for the plaintiffs at the Berne Trial. Subsequently, while in Paris Burtsev published a Russian-language book in 1938 based on his testimony called The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A proven forgery. Welt-Dienst entered the picture by spearheading efforts to secure other Russian √©migr√© experts as part of the effort to defend the veracity of The Protocols. Defense testimony presented personally in court was limited, with Zander turning up as the only witness for the defendants. However, Fleischhauer helped coordinate efforts by other defense experts and himself provided media with extensive commentary and written material in support of the defendants (Theodore Fischer and Silvio Schnell), with Bodung-Verlag issuing a comprehensive German- language version of his The real Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. Expert's report. Despite these exertions, on 19 May 1935, the court declared The Protocols to be forgeries, plagiarisms, and obscene literature. The Judge Walter Meyer, a Christian who had not heard of The Protocols prior to the trial, said in conclusion: \\"I hope the time will come when nobody will be able to understand how in 1935 nearly a dozen sane and responsible men were able for two weeks to mock the intellect of the Bern court discussing the authenticity of the so-called Protocols, the very Protocols that, harmful as they have been and will be, are nothing but laughable nonsense\\". However, on 1 November 1937, the defendants appealed the verdict to the Obergericht (Cantonal Supreme Court) of Berne. A panel of three judges acquitted them, holding that The Protocols, while false, did not violate the statute at issue because they were used as a means of political propaganda. The presiding judge's opinion stated, for the record, that in his opinion the forgery of The Protocols was not in question and expressed regret that the law did not provide adequate protection for Jews from this sort of literature. The court also imposed the fees for both trials on the defendants.Ben-Itto, Hadassa. The lie that wouldn‚Äôt die: The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Chapter 11. Edgware, Middlesex, England: Mitchell Vallentine & Company, 2005. This decision gave grounds for later allegations that the appeal court \\"confirmed the authenticity of The Protocols\\", which is opposite to the facts‚Äîeven though technically the pro-Nazi side won the case. A definitive scholarly work on the trial is a 139-page monograph by Swiss artist Urs L√ºthi.L√ºthi, Urs.

Basel: Helbing & Lichtenhahn, 1992. Other especially important scholarly work on the controversy continues to be published by researcher Michael Hagemeister.These include Hagemeister's \\"Russian √©migr√©s in the Bern trial of the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' (1933‚Äì1935)\\", Cahiers Parisiens/Parisian Notebooks, 5, 2009, pp. 375‚Äì91; and \\"The 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' in court: The Bern trials 1933-1937,\\" in Webman, Esther (ed.), The Global Impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion - A century-old myth, London and New York: Routledge, 2011, pp. 241-53. Worldwide propaganda The excitement engendered by his appearance at the trial was a boon to Fleischhauer. By the mid-1930s, the Welt-Dienst emerged as the largest antisemitic operation in the world, publishing works in many foreign languages, and the nearest fascist equivalent to the rival communist Third International (Comintern). Fleischhauer credited a conversation he had years earlier with Eckart with sparking the original idea. In April 1938 he wrote the NSDAP Hauptarchiv that \\"Dietrich Eckart then spoke to me alone, in a wine-cellar where we were sitting, about the subject which could today describe the Welt-Dienst. He said something to the effect: 'If our idea comes to power, the Jew will try again, as he's tried before with any State which attempts to solve the Jewish Problem, to starve us out. And if that's no use, then try to ruin us through wars and revolutions. Adolf must therefore have an international movement that can help him from the outside, just as Der Stahlhelm and other groups help the Party from the outside today.'\\"Hauptarchiv Reel 54, \\"Dietrich Eckart\\" folder no. 1311. Letter from Fleischhauer to Huttke, dated 7 April 1938. NSDAP Hauptarchiv Collection. Microfilm. Stanford, California: Hoover Institute. Over time, a veritable international \\"who's who\\" of antisemitic collaborators and correspondents contributed to Welt-Dienst publications and in turn quoted from them, including Henry Coston (France), Louis Darquier (France), Arnold Leese (founder of the Imperial Fascist League in Britain), Ludwig Heiden (\\"Luis el-Hadj\\" - an SS official and journalist who converted to Islam and translated Hitler's Mein Kampf into the Arabic language), Ion Mo≈£a (or Motza, one of the leaders of the ultranationalist Iron Guard from Romania who fought on the rebel side as a volunteer in the Spanish Civil War), Juan Sampelayo (secretary of the Falange Party's Jefatura Nacional de Prensa y Propaganda [Department of Exchange of the National Leadership of Press and Propaganda] in Spain), as well as Boris T√∂dtli (Russia and Switzerland). In the United States, a number of organizations sympathetic to Nazi ideology subscribed to the inexpensive English-language World-Service bulletins. William Dudley Pelley frequently printed World-Service articles in his Silver Legion of America magazine, Liberation, advocating a \\"purge of Jews and Communists in Hollywood\\". Other American publications, including Father Charles Coughlin's Social Justice, Robert Edward Edmondson's American Vigilante Bulletins, and those issued by the Rev. Gerald Burton Winrod, were equally willing to push the World-Service line on the Jewish question via word-for-word syndicated reproduction of news items appearing in their periodicals. When it suited his purposes, Fleischhauer published Jewish authors such as Marcus Eli Ravage, a Romanian emigrant to the United States. Host of international antisemitic congresses During the 1930s, Fleischhauer further expanded his propaganda efforts by organizing the Pan- Aryan Anti-Jewish Union and a series of international antisemitic congresses to actively push for the suppression of Freemasonry, combat the alleged \\"Jewish conspiracy for world domination,\\" and encourage the geopolitical depopulation of Jews from within Europe through mandatory resettlement in southern Africa as was envisioned by the Nazi-promoted Madagascar Plan.Brechtken, Magnus. Madagaskar f√ºr die Juden: Antisemitische idee und politische praxis 1885-1945 (2nd edition), Oldenbourg, Germany: Wissenschaftsverlag, 1998. Typical of this rhetoric were the views expressed by a Japanese representative to the Welt-Dienst congress hosted in 1938 by Fleischhauer. On behalf of Imperial Japan, he stated that \\"Judeo-Masonry is forcing the Chinese to turn China into a spearhead for an attack on Japan, and thereby forcing Japan to defend herself against this threat. Japan is at war not with China but with Freemasonry, represented by General Chiang Kai-shek, the successor of his master, the Freemason Sun Yat-Sen\\".The Red Triangle: A History of Anti-Masonry. Robert L D Cooper. 2011. P.71. > Fleischhauer superseded at Welt-Dienst For many years Fleischhauer and his activities at Welt-Dienst took place with the approval of the Nazi regime. As was the case with a number of similar organizations and their leaders, he received secret direct financing from the German government. From 1933-37 this funding came from Joseph Goebbels' Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. After a shakeup in lines of authority, by 1938 the responsibility for international antisemitism was shifted to the Foreign Affairs Office of the Nazi Party (Aussenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP, shortened to APA). This was one of several agencies within the vast Amt Rosenberg (Rosenberg Bureau or Rosenberg Office), the collective term for the various agencies controlled by Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg. However, Fleischhauer's personal role at Welt- Dienst declined as Germany neared the start of World War II. Researcher Carmen Callil reports that Fleischhauer's political radicalism was beginning to hurt the Third Reich's international image. By 1938, she writes, \\"Hitler was advised that Fleischhauer was placing Germany in embarrassing positions abroad, as he was the kind of ‚Äòanti-Semite who pretends to see a threatening Jew behind every street corner of the world and who tries to deal with the matter in a psychosis of fear and secretiveness‚Äô.\\" In late July 1939, August Schirmer, an Amt Rosenberg functionary who had headed the \\"American Section\\" of Welt-Dienst, took over publication of the periodical and its related operations. This change was connected with a relocation of Welt-Dienst's editorial offices to Frankfurt am Main as part of a more formal reorganization of all anti-Jewish research establishments under Rosenberg's control, culminating in 1941 with the establishment of the Institut der NSDAP zur Erforschung der Judenfrage (Institute of the National Socialist German Workers Party for Research Into the Jewish Question). Fleischhauer was largely cut out of the publishing empire he founded. In fact, in 1941 he was living in the cellar of his home in Erfurt, running only a \\"tiny rump\\" version of the organizations he created as the focus of his life's work . The Welt-Dienst organization on the other hand continued for a time to prosper. By its high point in August 1943 Welt-Dienst was published in 18 languages. At that time, Schirmer stepped down and was replaced by an individual named Kurt Richter, who in addition to being the new publisher was also director of an \\"International Institute for the Enlightenment of the Jewish Question\\". As the war turned against Nazi Germany, Welt-Dienst continued with diminished distribution until finally ending all publication operations early in 1945. After the War During the post-war occupation, Fleischhauer underwent denazification in a series of American internment camps and hospitals where he was held from 1945‚Äì46. Upon his release in 1947, Fleischhauer even issued a written statement in which he denied any Nazi or fanatical antisemitic views.The original copy of his statement can be consulted in the Th√ºringisches Hauptstaatsarchiv, Weimar Amt zum Schutz des Volkseigentums Nr. LK 2787, Ulrich Fleischhauer, 11 August 1947. After this Fleischhauer retired from public life and lived quietly until his death on 20 October 1960 in Giengen. See also * George E.

Its official address is Donaghmede,Dublin City Council, : \\"The park is located in the heart of the 'North Fringe '- the new communities of Clongriffen and Belmayne, between the Hole in the Wall Road and the Mayne River in Donaghmede.\\" and it is located near the new development at Clongriffin, with Balgriffin a little to the west. It is owned and managed by Dublin City Council. History Father Collins Park is situated on part of an historic site that is significant from the medieval era, or more specifically, the Norman period. The park comprises part of the original and extensive Grange of Baldoyle, farmland supporting the Priory of All Saints (on the site of which Trinity College Dublin now stands), which had a chapel, now called Grange Abbey, the ruins of which still stand. During the early days of the Reformation in Ireland, the monastic settlements along the north east coast of Dublin (including Grange Abbey and accompanying farmland) were seized en masse at the behest of Henry VIII of England, who later gave it to the Corporation of Dublin.\\"Grange Abbey\\" To date, Dublin City Council continue to own and oversee swathes of the medieval monastic settlements of 'Grange of Baldoyle', including Grange Abbey, Father Collins Park, and the smaller park which retains the link along Hole in the Wall Road. (See also Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin and Civil parishes in Ireland.) The park was originally opened in memory of a once popular parish priest, Father Joe Collins, who worked to ensure public access to the lands. Having been farmland since at least early medieval times, the park initially comprised natural woodlands, ancient hedgerow, open spaces and playing fields for sports. The redeveloped park was reopened by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Eibhlin Byrne, and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, on 27 May 2009 . Father Collins Park continues to be owned and maintained by Dublin City Council. Details Redevelopment work on what is now Ireland's first wind-powered and sustainable public park began in September 2007 to a design by Argentinian architectural practice, Abelleyro and Romero. It includes sustainable features such as: wetlands which treat and store surface water from the park to prevent run-off, wind turbines to power the park, a green roof on the sports pavilion, use of Irish materials such as Carlow limestone, use of recycled materials in the concrete paving of the promenade and also the playground surfaces and newly planted native hedgerows. With five 50 kW wind turbines, it provides power for the projection of water from the central lake, the public lighting, maintenance depots, and sport club changing rooms. The park has since won a number of awards such as The Sustainability Award 2010, Best Public Space 2010, and Best Public Park & Best Environmentally Friendly Initiative for 2010 . Most recently, it was short listed by the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture 2011. The approximately 54 acres (or 26 hectares) encompasses some natural woodland; for sports, a 1.5 km peripheral running/cycling track, six playing pitches and six fitness stations; for leisure, a promenade, a concert amphitheatre and picnic areas with outdoor chess/draughts boards; and for activity, two playgrounds and a skate-park. For further information on the park, see and =Nature= Father Collins Park is approximately 3 km inland from Baldoyle Bay, with its estuaries and wetlands, which are protected by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (Ireland) . Declared a Statutory Nature Reserve in 1988 , the inner estuarine part of the estuary and wetlands of Baldoyle Bay are of high significance protected as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). They support several habitats that are listed on the EU Habitats Directive . Under the Ramsar Convention, it is designated as a wetland of international importance. Consequently, during the seasons of migration, the open lands of Father Collins Park continue to host migrating birds. Undisturbed lands remain an important refuge and hub for Arctic and European migratory birds. Of particular interest is the internationally important population of brent geese which inhabit the estuary. (See Brant goose.)

It was put forward by the London group of the Campaign for Better Transport and by the Coalition for a Sustainable Brent Cross Cricklewood.Coalition for a Sustainable Brent Cross Cricklewood Transport briefing material, 2009 onwards The proposal, published in 2008, envisaged a rapid transit network using existing or abandoned railway corridors and would have been similar to the Docklands Light Railway (DLR). It was promoted in the context of the Brent Cross Shopping Centre expansion project, a major urban planning scheme that involves the redevelopment of Brent Cross and northern Cricklewood. The stated aim was to alleviate anticipated traffic problems when this development goes ahead. The NWLLR has not been approved or funded. Overview The Campaign for Better Transport aimed to reduce CO2 emissions, pollution and cars on the roads. It has said that high-intensity bus services in Brent Cross create more pollution and traffic jams. =Route= The route would have had 34 stations on four lines: *Ealing Broadway - Hanger Lane South - West Acton - Alliance Road - North Acton - Harlesden - Craven Park - Taylors Lane - Neasden - Dudden Hill - Gladstone Park - Edgware Road Brent - Brent Cross Thameslink - Brent Cross Shopping Centre - Brent Cross South - Brent Cross *Park Royal - Park Royal Central - North Acton - Harlesden - Craven Park - Taylors Lane - Neasden - Brent Park - Tokyngton - Wembley Stadium *Wembley Stadium - Tokyngton - Brent Park - Neasden - Dudden Hill - Gladstone Park - Edgware Road Brent - Brent Cross Thameslink - Brent Cross Shopping Centre - Brent Cross South - Brent Cross *Finchley Road - West Hampstead - Mill Lane - Cricklewood - Brent Cross Thameslink - Brent Cross Shopping Centre - Brent Cross West - Hendon - Kingsbury Road - Colindeep Lane - Colindale - Grahame Park Way - Copthall - Mill Hill East - Finchley Central Core proposal The freight-only Dudding Hill line, which features in the proposal The proposal suggested that the service could be light rail, similar to the Docklands Light Railway. The core proposal envisaged a line running east‚Äìwest across north London from to , with extensions to and , and a new line running north‚Äìsouth from through Brent Cross to . The routes would have used a combination of existing passenger railway lines, freight lines and disused lines, linked by stretches of new track. The network was to include the Dudding Hill Line, the branch of the Central line and freight tracks parallel to the Midland Main Line. Political views The current and NWLLR-proposed rail track at North Acton The proposal had limited support from some local councils, but lacked the funding or support from the Greater London Authority that is necessary to undertake project costings or a feasibility study. The proposal was not supported by the site developers at Brent Cross and relied on changes being made to their plans. In April 2009, Ealing Council voted to call on Transport for London to look into the proposal and discuss its strategic potential with neighbouring councils. Harrow Council gave its support in principle, but stating that unless Transport for London provided \\"funding for a feasibility study to examine this proposal ... no more public money should be directed towards this proposal.\\" In 2009 Brian Coleman, the mayor of Barnet and London Assembly Member for Barnet and Camden, said \\"It's not feasible, it won't happen. Ideas like this are thought up by men who probably still have a train set in the attic.\\" Later that year, Barnet Council voted to request the developers to maintain contact with the light rail promoters. In January 2011, Brent Council voted to call on Transport for London to look into the proposal and discuss its strategic potential with neighbouring councils. In January 2014, Barnet Council voted that \\"much-needed orbital rail links should be investigated, routes safeguarded and included in financial planning\\", but it removed a reference in the original motion to \\"light-rail\\". In April 2019, ¬£320M of funding was approved for a new Brent Cross Thameslink station, that would also serve the potential new service.https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2019/03/15/funding-for-homes-and-a- new-railway-station-in-north-london/ Other proposals A similar proposal was put forward by West London Business in 2008 to build a -to- underground railway, called the West London Orbital. In 2009, the Greater London Assembly proposed using the Dudding Hill Line section of the route for a new London Overground service.Coalition for a Sustainable Brent Cross Cricklewood Briefing material on new London Overground service From 2016 a different scheme of the same name was developed by the West London Alliance boroughs, TfL and the GLA. This scheme features in the 2018 Mayor's Transport Strategy.

After he retired from riding Solos in the early 1980s, Boulger raced somewhat successfully in Speedcars (Midgets) from the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s. Boulger won a record nine South Australian Championships (a record jointly held with 1951 and 1952 World Champion Jack Young) as well as two Australian Solo Championships during his career. As part of the Australian team, John Boulger won one World Championship during his career, this being the 1976 World Team Cup held at the White City Stadium in London, England. Boulger had the honour of captaining the team to Australia's first Speedway World Team Cup victory. It was Australia's first World title in any speedway competition since Young's World Championship win in 1952. Career summary =Australia= John Boulger, whose father was a mechanic for international solo star Merv Harding, started his racing career in 1965 racing scrambles as a sidecar passenger with friend Brenton Hanks (which only lasted a year) before moving into speedway. His first race was at the Broken Hill Speedway in October 1966 where he lost an oil tank and seized the engine in his first meeting. He then got his break when he tagged along with leading Adelaide sidecar rider Len Bowes to the Northern Park Raceway in Melbourne. As a favour to Bowes, the promoter let Boulger ride just expecting him to make up the numbers, but everyone received a shock when Boulger broke the track record in his first ride. His home track was the famed, Rowley Park Speedway in Adelaide and he made his debut there on 29 October 1966.\\"Personal Profile: John Boulger\\", Speedway Post, volume 5, no. 12, July 1969, p. 16-17 He quickly went from promising rookie to star rider within a couple of seasons, and would become the best South Australian rider of his generation, and regarded as one of the states best ever riders alongside Jack Young. After finishing second to Sydney's Jim Airey at the Sydney Showground in 1970, Boulger won his first Australian Solo Championship in 1971 at Perth's ‚Öì mile () Claremont Speedway after a bold passing move on local favourite Chum Taylor in the last corner of the deciding heat to give him a 15-point maximum.\\"A Fitting Climax to John Boulger's Year\\", Motor Cycle News Speedway Extra 1971, p. 12 He finished in third place at Rowley Park in 1972 behind Airey and Denmarks reigning World Champion Ole Olsen, and won his last title in 1973 at the Sydney Showground with a 15-point maximum, leaving defending champion and \\"King of the Royale\\" Airey languishing in 4th place. Boulger then finished the 1974 championship at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground in 2nd place behind local rider Steve Reinke to cap a four-year run where he never finished the Australian title off the podium. He would place once more finishing 3rd in 1979 at the Olympic Park Speedway in Mildura behind local favourites Phil Crump and Danny Kennedy. Boulger's win in 1973 was the last time a South Australian rider would win the national title until Ryan Sullivan won in 2004. During the 1970s Boulger had a virtual stranglehold on the South Australian Solo Championship. He won his first title in 1970 before winning a record seven in a row between 1972 and 1978, all held at Rowley Park Speedway. He would win his ninth and last SA Championship at the new, Speedway Park in 1982. Boulger's ninth SA title saw him equal the record of nine wins by Jack Young. As of 2016, this record still stands, with the next best record being five wins by Queenslander Troy Batchelor. Boulger narrowly missed equaling Young's record in 1981 when he finished second in the championship behind Tony Boyle at Speedway Park. Boulger was undefeated in his first three rides, and was leading his fourth race when his front forks broke forcing him to crash and not finish the race. John Boulger won the inaugural Australasian Championship at the Western Springs Stadium in Auckland, New Zealand in 1976 defeating Billy Sanders, Phil Crump and multiple World Champion Ivan Mauger (the Australasian Final was introduced as a World Championship qualifying round for Australian and New Zealand riders). He then went on to finish in a 3-way tie for first place in 1977 at the Sydney Showground with Mauger and Crump, before eventually finishing third after a runoff. Later in 1982 he won the Australian Long Track Championship in the South Australian town of Morgan in 1982. Boulger retired from riding in 1984 and decided to stay in speedway, first by teaching young riders the art of racing a Solo motorbike, with many of his prot√©g√©'s racing at the Sidewinders Junior Speedway in Adelaide which opened in 1978. Boulger has been a long time supporter of Sidewinders and during the early-mid 1980s was a mentor to a number of younger riders including Steve Baker, Mark Fiora, Shane Parker, Craig Hodgson and Shane Bowes, the son of Boulger's long time friend and the 1968 Australian Sidecar Champion Len Bowes. In 1985 he started racing Sprintcars before moving on to drive Speedcars with some success, including winning the prestigious \\"Harry Neale Memorial\\" at Speedway Park in 1987. Boulger would race for a few more seasons before retiring from the sport in the mid-1990s to concentrate on driving his taxi.http://www.rowleypark.com/plugins/p17_image_gallery/popup.php?categoryid=3&p17;_sectionid=1&p17;_imageid=522 In 2011, John Boulger was inducted into the Australian Speedway Hall of Fame. On 29 November 2014, John Boulger was inducted into the Motorcycling South Australia Hall of Fame. =England= John Boulger arrived in England in 1967 to ride for the Long Eaton Archers, scoring a paid 12 point maximum in just his third match against Exeter. He was recommended to the Long Eaton management by British star Ray Wilson who had been on the lookout for Australian talent when he rode in Adelaide in 1967 and picked Boulger as a future star. Boulger appeared in 33 league matches during 1967 for Long Eaton, finishing with a 5.95 points average. In 1968, Long Eaton management moved the team to Leicester where they would become the Leicester Lions and Boulger remained for six seasons, helping the Lions to second place in the 1971 British League, and gradually improving his average to 9.46 by 1972. In 1973 he replaced Wilson as captain of the Lions and averaged 10.25 points to place 7th in the Riders' Championship (Wilson, that years British Champion, would finish second in the Riders' Championship behind multiple World Champion Ivan Mauger). In 1974 Boulger moved to ride for Cradley United where he remained until 1976 before returning to Leicester in 1977. He would remain with the Lions until 1979 when he retired from British League racing in order to spend more time with his family and on his business interests in Adelaide.Jones, Alan (2010) Speedway in Leicester: The Lions Roar, Automedia, p.159-160 =International= Boulger had the honor of captaining the victorious Australian team at the 1976 Speedway World Team Cup held at London's White City Stadium. He also partnered Phil Crump in the 1974 World Pairs final at Hyde Road in Manchester, finishing in second place behind the Swedish pairing of 1974 World Champion Anders Michanek, and his partner S√∂ren Sj√∂sten. Boulger and Crump would finish 5th in the 1975 World Pairs final at the Olympic Stadium in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. 1975 would prove to be Boulger's last World Pairs Final appearance. John Boulger qualified for two World Final's during his career. He finished 13th with 6 points in 1973 at the Silesian Stadium in Chorz√≥w (Katowice), Poland in front of the largest speedway attendance in history, an estimated 130,000 where he was the only Australian to qualify and other than runner-up Ivan Mauger was the highest placed Commonwealth rider alongside English whiz-kid Peter Collins who also finished with 6 points (Collins would go on to win the World Championship at the same venue in 1976). Boulger also rode in the 1977 World Final at the Ullevi Stadium in G√∂teborg, Sweden, where on a wet track he finished 12th with 5 points from his 5 rides. The only other Australian in the field was Sydney's Billy Sanders who finished 9th with 7 points. Boulger also rode for Australia in numerous test matches at home and overseas, including captaining the team on several occasions.

Released in Europe (Germany and The Netherlands) and Japan at the end of 1997. No official release for this in USA. The song was written by Michael Hutchence and Andrew Farriss and recorded by the band in Dublin during the summer of 1996. Although it was never officially released as a single in USA, INXS released \\"Don't Lose Your Head\\" as a promo tie-in with Paramount's 1997 film Face/Off starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. A Radio Edit version of the single was remixed by Tom Lord-Alge to clean up the opening lyrics; \\"You wake up in the morning with a starfuck for a friend\\" to \\"You wake up in the morning with a dealer for a friend\\". Trivia According to an interview in the News of the World Sunday Magazine, the lyrics for \\"Don't Lose Your Head\\" were aimed squarely at \\"Oasis\\" frontman Liam Gallagher who Hutchence had many disagreements with over the years. Nicolas Cage was spotted at INXS' Montreal show for the Elegantly Wasted Tour on 25 September 1997. Hutchence dedicated \\"What You Need\\" and \\"Don't Lose Your Head\\" to the actor, and also climbed up to Cage's balcony during \\"Time\\". =Use in Face/Off= In addition to being used as a promotional tie-in song for Face/Off, the song itself plays on Castor Troy's (John Travolta) car radio as he is driving through Sean Archer's neighborhood for the first time with his new face. UK release \\"Don‚Äôt Lose Your Head\\" was pressed as a UK promo single but, upon Hutchence's death, it was immediately withdrawn. Around 500 copies were originally pressed but destroyed almost instantly. Although the single did appear commercially in other territories such as Japan, its purpose for the UK market was primarily as a marketing tool for Face/Off. Again the single continued with the band's unique UK catalogue numbering system and received the number INXCJ31. With so few copies pressed in the first place, followed by the stock‚Äôs destruction, an extremely small number ‚Äì estimated to be less than 50 ‚Äì actually escaped the burner, thus making this the rarest INXS CD pressing of all time, even rarer than the withdrawn set of 3 UK CD singles of Searching which preceded it, that were due to be released but for Hutchence's death. B-sides As well as the new mixes of \\"Don't Lose Your Head\\", the CD Singles included live versions of previous hits recorded on the Promotional Tour for the Elegantly Wasted album. Video A performance-style video was directed by Nick Egan and included clips from the movie. While on tour in South Africa, the band was asked by the producers of Face/Off to shoot a video for the song. The video was shot inside a large plane hangar on an airstrip located in Cape Town.

Fish's 1968 novel The Murder League. It opened at the Savoy Theatre, London on 20 February 1989 and ran until 19 August 1989, starring Donald Sinden as Trevor Foyle, June Whitfield as Dora Winslow, Frank Middlemass as Bartie Cruikshank, Marc Sinden as Simon Vale, Ken Wynne as Charters, with Paul Ridley, Chris Tranchell and William Sleigh, It was directed by Brian Murray. An earlier draft played a limited engagement at the Hartman Theatre, Stamford, CT, in November, 1984.

An acting editionOver My Dead Body page, Dramatists Play Service website was published by Dramatists Play Service in 1998 and remains in print as of . Overview Over My Dead Body is a comedic homage to the detective stories of the 1920s and ‚Äô30s, but is more accurately classified as a comedy- thriller than a comedy-mystery. Unlike the traditional Agatha Christie-style \\"whodunit\\", the audience knows from the start the identities of the would-be murderers, and is taken step-by-step through their inept attempts to carry out their convoluted crime. The play thus falls into the subgenre of \\"inverted\\" detective story, characterized by being told from the viewpoint not of the detective but of the criminal, the emphasis being on the suspense of whether he/she/they will succeed and, if so, evade capture, rather than the surprise resulting from an unknown killer's unmasking. Other works in the \\"inverted\\" vein include Francis Ile's Malice Aforethought, Frederick Forsyth's The Day of the Jackal, Frederick Knott's Wait Until Dark, and numerous film and television works produced and/or directed by Alfred Hitchcock, such as Rope, Dial M for Murder, and Marnie. Plot synopsis Trevor Foyle, Dora Winslow, and Bartie Cruikshank are British mystery writers whose time has come and gone. Having watched their style of fiction‚Äîwith its eccentric detectives, \\"impossible\\" murders, and least-likely suspects‚Äîdwindle in popularity and sales over the decades, they're resigned to living out their few remaining years in the reading room of the Murder League: a crime-writers' literary club of which they are the last surviving founders. There, day after day, waited upon by the League's loyal (and even more aged) butler Charters, the pompous Trevor rails against the decline in crime-writing standards, while the more philosophical Dora busies herself with her knitting, and ever-oblivious Bartie dozes in his easy chair, dreaming of murder plots long past. Passing through the club, Simon Vale‚Äîa younger member who writes best-selling thrillers steeped in sex and gore‚Äîbelittles the elder trio for their persistence in portraying murder as stylish, ingeniously contrived puzzles, rather than the brutal, bloody, frequently irrational thing it is in real life. Stung by his words, the three older writers hypothesize what would happen should a real- life murder be committed as it is in their books, with outr√© touches and cryptic clues. Conceivably, it would spark a renaissance of \\"Golden Age\\" whodunits‚Äîperhaps even motivate people to buy their books again. Fired with enthusiasm at the prospect, they resolve to turn their hypothesis into reality: instead of merely writing a fictional murder, they'll commit a real one! Needless to say, they ultimately learn that arranging for someone to be found shot, stabbed and hanged in a room locked and barricaded from the inside (wearing a gorilla costume, no less) is somewhat more difficult to accomplish in real life than on the printed page. Especially when the would-be murderers are considerably past their physical prime and, as it turns out, prone to queasiness when confronted with the necessity of having to inflict actual physical mayhem on a real, live human being. With the aid of, among other diverse items, a bayonetted rifle, a Xanax-laced bottle of ketchup, a mace- wielding suit of armor, an ill-fitting red dress, a recalcitrant thumbtack, a convenient gust of wind, and an unsuspected fly in the ointment‚Äîthe classic British detective story and our protagonists' reputations are ultimately rescued from a premature demise. Allusions Over My Dead Body alludes frequently to actual works of detective fiction, including: :*The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (Agatha Christie, 1926) :*What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw (Agatha Christie, 1934) :*Trent's Last Case (E.C. Bentley, 1913) :*Gaudy Night (Dorothy L. Sayers, 1935) Real-life crimes and criminals are also mentioned: :*The siege of Sidney Street :*The Manson Family murders :*Jack the Ripper Discrepancies The authors take a certain degree of artistic license with the setting of Over My Dead Body. Though the Murder League of the play is clearly patterned after the real-life Detection Club, an informal organization of British detective story writers founded in 1930, reality has been somewhat romanticized for the stage. The original never occupied permanent \\"gentlemen‚Äôs club\\" type rooms such as in the play‚Äîwith aged servant, macabre memorabilia, and \\"excellent wine cellar\\"‚Äîbut instead met at a variety of locales for its periodic get-togethers. Liberties also appear to have been taken with the ages of the play‚Äôs protagonists. Though no specific year is given for the play's action, allusions to Xanax, Sylvester Stallone, and the phrase \\"get your rocks off\\" set it in the mid-1980s (the time of the play's writing) at the earliest. Yet Trevor and Bartie are described as being in their 70s, and Dora‚Äî though only characterized as being \\"of advanced years\\"‚Äîis clearly intended to be their contemporary. This would not only put them in their teens at the time of the real-life Detection Club‚Äôs founding, but make them at least twenty years the junior of the youngest of its actual founding members, Anthony Berkeley (b. 1893). Even precocity, one presumes, has its limits. Divergence from source material The published edition of Over My Dead Body states the play was \\"Suggested by the novel The Murder League, by Robert L. Fish.\\" This would appear to be an accurate assessment, as the only element retained from the original novel is the central concept of three elderly British mystery writers turning to real murder. All else has been changed: the basic plot-line, the methods of the protagonists to achieve their goal, their motive (purely pecuniary in the novel), subsidiary characters and locales, the protagonists' names‚Äîand even, in the case of one, gender. The conflict between the \\"cozy\\" and \\"hard-boiled\\" genres of crime writing, heavily emphasized in the play, is non-existent in the novel, as is the characters‚Äô intention of being caught and made to pay the penalty for what they‚Äôve done. Unlike those in the play, the protagonists of the novel succeed in directly and unambiguously murdering not just one but ten victims, and the book ends in a lengthy trial scene not in the theatrical version. Even the novel‚Äôs title has a different connotation than in the play, referring to the principal trio of characters rather than a literary organization. The prolific Fish‚Äîauthor of over 40 novels and short stories, including the one on which the Steve McQueen film BullittIMDb entry on Bullitt was based‚Äîsubsequently followed The Murder League with two sequels featuring the same principals: Rub-a-Dub-Dub (1971) and A Gross Carriage of Justice (1979). Robert L. Fish died in 1981, two years before the writing of Over My Dead Body.Mini-bio and bibliography of Robert L. Fish Critical reaction Over My Dead Body received positive critical response in its pre- London try-out: ::\\"It is very funny indeed...should appeal to detective story buffs and those who like a play to have plenty of humour... would be a pleasure to watch if only for the characters it contains.\\" Newspaper review, Pauline Barnes, Hastlemere Herald, 2/2/89 ::\\"A source of wonder and delirious delight...one of the funniest plays of its kind... had it not been for the inhibiting restraints of the theatre mystique for the preservation of its dignity, I would have been overtaken by convulsions, propelled into the aisles, a happy, helpless invalid of intemperate laughter.\\"Newspaper review, Leslie Bainbridge, Woking News & Mail, 2/2/89 Its reception in London, however, was less than enthusiastic, the only genuine \\"rave\\" review coming from the Financial Times: ::\\"Welcome back whodunnit land... Sutton and Fingleton have gone for the gold by presenting the ultimate spoof thriller.\\"Newspaper review, Antony Thorncroft, Financial Times, 2/21/89 Over My Dead Body nevertheless enjoyed a 7-month run in London and has since received numerous non-professional stagings both in America and abroad, notably in Japan.Websites promoting Japanese productions in 2004 (at bottom of page), and 2006 . A review of a repertory production at the Asolo Theatre Company, Sarasota, Florida in 1997 declared: ::\\"As the sight gags get more outrageous, the pace gets more manic. You might declare the play guilty of terminal madcap silliness. But that's hardly a capital crime.\\"Newspaper review, Joanne Milani, The Tampa Tribune, 12/25/96 In program notes for the same staging, the late, renowned detective author Stuart M. Kaminsky wrote: ::\\"Over My Dead Body... is in the greatest tradition of mystery-comedy, a comedy which shows respect for the things we loved and probably still love about the traditional mystery from the murder in the locked room to the doddering ancient butler. The trick, dear reader (as Dr. Watson might write) is in laughing with the tale and its conventions and not at them, to approach the tales of brilliant, often flamboyant and eccentric amateur sleuths and those who have written about them with nostalgic admiration and a sigh of recognition. ::\\"Above all, Over My Dead Body is funny. But it is also a roaringly good mystery full of twists, turns and several surprise endings. It is a perfect potage of Sleuth, The Real Inspector Hound, and Noises Off. Add to this the fact that Over My Dead Body, like Sleuth and The Last of Sheila, is about mystery writers and you have a deliciously subtle detective story and its practitioners.Program, 1996-1997 season, Asolo Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. p. 21 References * Sutton, Michael & Fingleton, Anthony, Over My Dead Body, Dramatists Play Service, Inc., 1998 * Fish, Robert L., The Murder League, Ace Books, 1968 Notes Category:1989 plays Category:West End plays Category:Comedy thriller plays ","title":"Over My Dead Body (play)"},{"id":"23887412","text":"Crystal Warren is a South African poet.

The play's title has been rendered in English in many different ways in the critical literature, including: The Diary of a Scoundrel, which Brockett and Hildy give as an alternative; or simply The Scoundrel, in Gerould (1974, 73); Even Wise Men Err in Sealey Rahman (199, 174); Even a Wise Man Stumbles, in Magarshack (1950, 309). The play offers a satirical treatment of bigotry and charts the rise of a double-dealer who manipulates other people's vanities.Banham (1998, 829), Brockett and Hildy (2003, 370), and Gerould (1974, 73). It is Ostrovsky's best-known comedy in the West.Banham (1998, 829) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 370). Production history 1868 ‚Äì Alexandrinsky Theatre, Saint Petersburg. 1868 ‚Äì Maly Theatre, Moscow. 1885 ‚Äì Korsh Theatre, Moscow. The seminal Russian theatre director Konstantin Stanislavsky directed the play with his Moscow Art Theatre.Benedetti (1999, 212, 387). The production opened on . Stanislavski played General Krutitsky and Kachalov played Glumov. A production of the play was the most significant of the early theatre work of the Russian Soviet film director Sergei Eisenstein.Rudnitsky (1988, 96). The playwright Sergei Tretyakov transformed Ostrovsky's text into a revue (what Eisenstein called a \\"montage of attractions\\"), which was entitled Wiseman (Mudrets).Gerould (1974, 73‚Äì74), Kleberg (1980, 81), and Rudnitsky (1988, 96). Eisenstein and Tretyakov's approach was part of the Russian avant-garde Futurist movement known as \\"Eccentricism,\\" which sought the \\"circusisation\\" of the theatre.Kleberg (1980, 78‚Äì82), Kolocotroni, Goldman, and Taxidou (1998, 295‚Äì297), and Rudnitsky (1988, 94‚Äì96). In celebration of the centennial of Ostrovsky's birth, the production opened in April 1923.The sources offer different dates for the opening: Gerould gives 16 April while Kleberg gives 26 April; see Gerould (1974, 73) and Kleberg (1980, 80‚Äì81). It was staged by the First Workers' Theatre of the Prolekult in its theatre in an ornate mansion on Vozdvizhenka Street, with a cast that included Maxim Shtraukh, Ivan Pyryev, and Grigori Aleksandrov.Gerould (1974, 74), Kleberg (1980, 80‚Äì81), and Rudnitsky (1988, 96). Eisenstein drew on popular theatre techniques such as farce and the commedia dell'arte in his staging, which sought to make every metaphor concrete and physical; he wrote:Gerould (1974, 74). A screening of Eisenstein's first film, entitled Glumov's Diary, concluded the performance. Writing in 1928, Eisenstein explained that he had aimed \\"to achieve a revolutionary modernization of Ostrovsky, i.e., a social re-evaluation of his characters, seeing them as they might appear today.\\"Quoted by Gerould (1974, 73).

The light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Egg Rock Light Station in 1988. Description and history The Egg Rock Light Station consists of two buildings, a combination light tower and keeper's house, and a fog station building. The keeper's house is a roughly square 1-1/2 story wood frame building, with a hip roof pierced by dormers on all four sides. The painted brick tower, high, rises through the center of the house. The light is a VRB-25 aerobeacon, mounted in a 1986 replacement lantern house. It is configured to flash red every 40 seconds. The fog station is a brick structure southwest of the main building, with a gable-on-hip roof. Egg Rock Light The Egg Rock light originally was fitted with a fifth-order Fresnel lens. The fog station (originally steam-powered) was added in 1904. The station was automated by the United States Coast Guard in 1976, at which time its ancillary structures except the fog station were torn down. The lantern house was removed and the light was replaced by the present aerobeacon. After public protest, a replacement lantern house was installed in 1986. The light continues to be managed by the Coast Guard, and is not open to the public; the island and buildings are owned by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

There was also a vote on funding a new Toronto City Hall, which was rejected by voters. Toronto mayor Nathan Phillips was opposed for reelection after his first year in office by Board of Control member Roy Belyea, who had been a staunch opponent of Phillips during the year. Also running was Trotskyist Ross Dowson. ;Results :Nathan Phillips - 70,647 :Roy Belyea - 26,717 :Ross Dowson - 2,374 Plebiscites Two questions appeared on the ballot. The first was on whether municipal terms of office should be extended to two years from one. The second was to authorize the construction of a proposed new city hall to replace the existing city hall, which had been built in 1899. The proposed structure, designed by a partnership of three leading Toronto architectural forms, would have been a conservative, symmetrical limestone-clad building in the Modernist style facing a landscaped square, and was widely criticized as \\"drab and boxy\\". ;2-year term :For - 48,024 :Against - 33,688 Two-year terms would be put in place effective the 1956 Toronto municipal election. ;New City Hall :For - 28,449 :Against - 32,564 Source: \\"Mayoralty and Questions\\" The Globe and Mail (1936-2016); Toronto, Ont.

The mansion building (designed by James Wyatt in 1788) is located in the middle of of parkland, lakes, gardens and monuments. In 1908, it became the first country club in the UK. In 2013, it was awarded five red AA stars, the highest accolade for service and facilities for hotels, by The Automobile Association. Stoke Park has served as the filming location for several major films, including James Bond's Goldfinger and Tomorrow Never Dies, Bridget Jones's Diary and Layer Cake. It also hosts the annual Boodles Tennis Championships as a warm-up to Wimbledon, a week prior to the Championships. In June 2014, Stoke Park hosted an outdoor charity concert for SportsAid (patron: the Duchess of Cambridge). Sir Elton John sang to 5,000 people and raised ¬£825,000. History =The estate= Aerial Shot of the mansion and Repton Bridge The Stoke Park estate's history dates back to the time of the Domesday Book. From 1066, the estate was inherited in a direct line of descent for 515 years until it had to be sold to the Crown in 1581 to pay the outstanding debts of Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, whose father Francis, the commander in chief of Henry VIII‚Äôs army, had rebuilt the Manor House (part of which can still be seen today) in 1555. John Penn (1760‚Äì1834), a soldier, scholar and poet, is responsible for most of what can be seen at the estate today. He used a large proportion of the ¬£130,000 the new United States government paid for his family's 26-million acre (110,000 km¬≤) plot in Pennsylvania. The mansion was designed by James Wyatt (architect to George III) who worked on the development of the mansion and surrounding monuments from 1790 to 1813. The parkland was the product of two geniuses of 18th century landscape architecture, Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown and Humphry Repton, who designed in 1792 the landscape that can be seen today. The estate is listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. =The club= The estate was used as a private residence until 1908, when Nick \\"Pa\\" Lane Jackson, founder of the Corinthian Sporting Club (Corinthian F.C.), purchased the estate and turned it into the UK's first country club. One of his initial objectives was to commission the famous amateur golfer and course architect Harry Colt (who also designed Pinevalley, Wentworth, Sunningdale, Muirfield and Royal Portrush) to design the golf course. The golf course, along with the tennis courts and the conversion of the mansion, were all completed within seven months. In 1908, the club‚Äôs first president was Prince Albert of Schleswig-Holstein and first vice president was the Right Honourable Earl Howe. The committee also included Lord Chesterfield, Lord Kinnoull and Lord Decies. In his 1910 book, The Golf Courses of the British Isles, Bernard Darwin wrote: center The mansion The mansion and west facing gardens The main building is a Georgian era mansion located at the centre of the of parkland. The architecture of the United States Capitol, Washington D.C., which was built later, bears some resemblance to the mansion. The pavilion Opened in 2008, the pavilion building has a health and beauty spa, swimming pool, fitness studio, gym and bedrooms and suites on the first and second floors. Golf The Repton Bridge on Stoke Park's golf course Stoke Park's 27 hole championship golf course was designed by Harry Colt in 1908. It was opened in July 1909 and received immediate acclaim: Stoke Park is considered one of the \\"Top 100 Courses in England\\". The Boodles tennis challenge Stoke Park is the host of the annual Boodles Challenge, hosted the week prior to the Championships at Wimbledon. Playing on Stoke Park's grass courts, the world's best men have competed for the Boodles trophy since 2002. Movies at Stoke Park Stoke Park has been the backdrop to many movies and TV programmes. Two James Bond films, Goldfinger (1964) and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) have been filmed at the club. The epic duel between Bond (Sean Connery) and Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) led to Sean Connery's own \\"lifelong love affair with golf\\". The \\"mini break\\" and rowing scenes from Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) were filmed in the mansion, lakes and The Pennsylvania Suite. In 2004, three movies were released featuring Stoke Park: Wimbledon, Bride & Prejudice, and Layer Cake. In Wimbledon, Paul Bettany featured on the grass tennis courts. Stoke Park featured heavily in Layer Cake, including the dramatic ending with Daniel Craig and Sienna Miller filmed on the mansion steps. Guy Ritchie's RocknRolla (2008) also featured the grass tennis courts and the 21st Green. Other features filmed at Stoke Park include, The Vice, The Professionals, Midsomer Murders, Dead of Night, and many advertisements.

Dating from the 9th century, it is located outside the Manse, close to the parish church.Ritchie 1997, p.30. It is inscribed on one side with a Celtic cross and on the other with a variety of Pictish symbols. It is a scheduled monument. Location The cross slab is situated at the northeast edge of Glamis village in the grounds of the Manse, close to St Fergus church ().  Description  The stone is a cross-slab high, wide and thick. The slab is pedimented and carved on the cross face in relief, and the rear face bears incised symbols. It falls into John Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's classification system as a class II stone. The cross face bears a Celtic cross carved in relief with ogee armpits. It has an incised ring and the shaft and roundel are decorated with knotwork interlace designs, with the arms and portion above the roundel holding zoomorphic interlaces. The cross is surrounded by incised symbols and figural representations. In the lower left-hand quadrant is depiction of two bearded, long-haired men apparently fighting with axes. Above them is what appears to be a cauldron with human legs dangling out of it. The lower right-hand quadrant holds what appears to be either a deer or a hound's head, similar to symbols found on the Monifieth 2 stone, above a triple disc symbol. The top right quadrant holds a centaur holding a pair of axes. The top left quadrant holds what has been interpreted as a lion. The rear of the slab holds three incised symbols: a serpent above a fish, with a mirror at the bottom. Historian Lloyd Laing has noted some peculiarities of the layout of the cross face. Firstly, the arms are not perfectly perpendicular to the shaft, being rotated slightly (2.5¬∞ anticlockwise). Secondly, the axis of the interlace of the cross roundel is skewed from the axis of the shaft by some 13¬∞. Relationship with other stones Rear of the stone, showing incised symbols The Glamis manse stone belongs to the Aberlemno School of Pictish sculpture as extended by Laing from Ross Trench Jellicoe's original proposed list.

Established in 1890, the light marks the approach to Blue Hill Bay and the southern approaches to Mount Desert Island on the central coast of Maine. The light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Great Duck Island Light Station on March 14, 1988. The light is an active aid to navigation maintained by the United States Coast Guard; the property is owned by the College of the Atlantic, which operates a research station there. Description and history Great Duck Island is a small island, located in the Gulf of Maine about south of Mount Desert Island off the coast of central Maine. The light station occupies a roughly parcel at the southern tip of the island. Five buildings (out of a larger number built) make up the station: a tower, keeper's house, fog station house, oil house, and a small shed. The tower, built in 1890, is a cylindrical brick structure in height, with an attached workroom. It is capped by a circular iron railing, which surrounds the ten-sided lantern house. The gable-roofed workroom extends to the west. Just south of the tower is the square brick hip-roofed fog signal building, also built in 1890. A small brick oil house stands east of the tower. Toward the northern end of the property is the 1890 keeper's house, one of three built and the only one to survive. It is a 1¬Ω story wood frame structure, with clapboard siding and a dormered gable roof. The shed, which also appears to date to 1890, stands northeast of the house. The station was established in 1890, a time when Mount Desert Island was becoming a popular resort destination. The light was first magnified by a fifth-order lens, which was replaced by a fourth-order lens in 1902. The light was automated in 1986. The fog station was originally operated by steam and powered by coal, for which an engine house, coal bunk, and rain catchment house were built. These facilities were torn down by the Coast Guard when the station was automated. Most of Great Duck Island was purchased in joint tenancy by the state and the Nature Conservancy in 1984. The station property was acquired in 1997 by the College of the Atlantic, which established the Alice Eno Field Research Station to perform research on the large bird population that the island supports. The keeper's house is used as a residence by student researchers.

The term \\"alliance\\" is not a taxonomic rank defined in any of the nomenclature codes. It is used for any group of species, genera or tribes to which authors wish to refer, that have at some time provisionally been considered to be closely related. The term is often used for a group that authors are studying in further detail in order to refine the complex taxonomy. For example, a molecular phylogenetics study of the Aerides‚ÄìVanda Alliance (Orchidaceae: Epidendroideae) confirmed that the group is monophyletic, and clarified which species belong in each of the 14 genera. In other orchid groups, the various alliances that have been defined do not correspond well to clades. Historically, some 19th century botanical authors used alliance to denote groups that would now be considered orders. This usage is now obsolete, and the ICN (Article 17.2) specifies that such taxa are treated as orders.

Macroscope was developed and is maintained by Fujitsu in Canada. It is primarily used as their core body of knowledge to support the consulting services that they provide to their clients and is also licensed as a commercial product to a number of their clients Macroscope presentation, Fujitsu.  History  = 1984-1985: \\"DMR\\" Information System Development Guides = The first publication of methods that are at the source of Macroscope were two \\"Information System Development Guides\\": Part 1 Managing the ProjectInformation System Development Guide Part 1 Managing the Project, DMR AND ASSOCIATES LTD, 1986, and Part 2 Developing the System.Information System Development Guide Part 2 Developing the System, DUCROS, MEILLEUR, ROY AND ASSOCIATES LTD, 1984, The same books were published in French in 1984. These two methods were known as the \\"DMR\\" methods and were later attributed version number 1.0. The two methods were based on fundamentals or principles that established the general approach. The methods were described in terms of processes, techniques and deliverables. The main approach for system design was by integrating the French MeriseTardieu H., Nanci D. & Pascot D., Conception d'un syst√®me d'information - construction de la base de donn√©es, Editions d'organisation, Paris, 1979 data and the American Gane and SarsonChris Gane & Trish Sarson, Structured System Analysis: tools and techniques, Improved System Technologies, New York, 1979 process modelling methods. = 1987-1990: Information System Delivery Series = Publication of a set of five books collectively called \\"Information System Delivery Series\\" by DMR Group Inc. This publication was also issued in French under the title: \\"Collection Mise en oeuvre de syst√®mes d'information\\". The collection contained the following books: * Project Management Guide, * System Development Guide, * System Owner's Guide, * Prototyping Guide, * Sample Set of Phase Reports. The 1987 edition was later attributed version number 2.0. The 1990 edition of this collection was re-labeled \\"DMR Productivity Plus\\", which was quickly nicknamed to \\"P+\\" by users. This edition is later attributed version number 2.1. = 1990-1996: DMR Macroscope = Research and Development project labelled \\"Le Macroscope Informatique\\", leads to the product initially called \\"DMR Macroscope\\" and re-branded in 2002 to \\"Macroscope\\". This program was initiated by DMR Group Inc., along with the Province of Quebec (Canada), industrial partners, research centers partners, and user groups that contributed financially and logistically. The initial objective of this program was to \\"develop a set of integrated products, that is, methods, software tools, training program in order to improve the development and usage of information technology\\". In a 1996 Research Note,DMR's Macroscope: A powerful Mix, Gartner Research Note P-400-156, August 29, 1996 Gartner writes: > Taken together, this is one of the most extensive sets of methods and tools > produced by any vendor. DMR's purpose is focused on service delivery, but > the methods are clearly designed for use by clients. This R&D; effort was divided into four knowledge domains, initially known as Productivity Plus (P+), Strategy Plus (S+) Benefits Plus (B+) and Architecture Plus (A+). = 1994-1995: \\"P+OnLine\\" method = A first commercial product under the \\"DMR Macroscope\\" umbrella, called \\"P+ OnLine\\" is released in 1994 and is the first release to display a version number, that is 2.2. Then the project gradually releases the following product components under new commercial names: * DMR ProductivityCentre (renaming of ProductivityPlus) * DMR ArchitectureLab (renaming of Architecture Plus) * DMR ResultStation (renaming of Benefits Plus) * DMR StrategyForum (renaming of Strategy Plus) = 1996-1998: DMR Macroscope 3.0 - 3.1 = Released in 1996, DMR Macroscope 3.0 was the first publication of the methodology in the HTML format, with mitigated success. This version was replaced in 1998 with version 3.1. = 2001: DMR Macroscope 3.5 = Release of version 3.5. The domain names lose their \\"DMR\\" prefixes, and ManagementSuite is added to the DMR Macroscope product. = 2002-2011: Macroscope 4.0 - 4.9 = Release of 4.0 in 2002. Re branding of the company to Fujitsu Consulting and the product suite loses its \\"DMR\\" prefix and is simply branded as \\"Macroscope\\". Then successive versions 4.5 to 4.9, and interim updates are released at a pace of approximately one per year. = 2012: Macroscope 5.0 = Release of 5.0 in 2012. The domain names are changed to a simpler terminology. The product is also offered \\"as a service\\" or hosted version for specific clients. = 2014: Macroscope 5.2 = The enterprise architecture approach is substantively revised.  Knowledge organization  The Macroscope methodology suite is organised into five process domains,Macroscope description on Macroscope User Group site The domains are: Architecture (previously known as ArchitectureLab) for enterprise architecture, Project (previously known as ManagementSuite) for project management, Solution (previously known as ProductivityCentre) for system development and maintenance, Benefits (previously known as ResultStation) for benefits realisation program management and portfolio management, and Vision (previously known as StrategyForum) for enterprise strategy. All domains of Macroscope are structured in a similar fashion using concepts described in the Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) of the Object Management Group (OMG). Fujitsu was one of the many contributors to SPEM and sections of Macroscope are used to depict some elements of SPEM. A domain of Macroscope typically presents the following sections. A process, usually presented as a workflow, describes the phases, steps and activities, under the responsibility of which role, and what deliverables are resulting from the process. A deliverable, presented with a description, a template and, generally, one or more examples, is a work product resulting from a process. A technique is a detailed method of accomplishing something, and is used to produce the content of one or more deliverables. Some domains of Macroscope contain many processes. For example, the domain called Project, contains only one process, called Project Management, while the Benefits domain contains a Program Management process and a Portfolio Management process. Each Macroscope domain is also based on a set of fundamental principles, which help understanding, adapting and using the process.  Methodology domains  = Vision = Before version 5.0, this was known as StrategyForum, formed of two words: Strategy, the main subject of interest, and Forum, referring to a group of stakeholders discussing about the evolution or the future of something. The intent of Vision is to provide a methodology to capture, structure, document and confirm an organisation's business strategy, and understand the organisation's strategy process. = Architecture = Before version 5.0, this was known as ArchitectureLab, formed of two words: Architecture, the main subject of interest referring to Enterprise Architecture, and Lab, referring to the word Laboratory, where one can simulate the reality through a model representing such reality. In this context, ArchitectureLab initially came with a modeling and simulation tool that allowed one to create a model of business processes and simulate the behaviour of such process. The intent of Architecture is to provide a method for delivering the capabilities required to support the organization's strategy. = Solution = Before version 5.0, this was known as ProductivityCentre. This domain name was not following exactly the same naming pattern as the other domains. This is largely due to the longer history of this methodology used to be called Productivity Plus, often referred to as P+ by users. To preserve a strong connection the word Productivity was kept and the word \\"Centre\\" was added to refer to \\"where things get delivered\\". The intent of Solution is to provide organizations with the appropriate information system solutions and help them maintain and operate these systems to continuously support their evolving business needs. = Benefits = Before version 5.0, this was known as ResultStation, formed of two words: Results (the final \\"s\\" combined with the starting \\"s\\" of the second word), which refers to the outcomes resulting from a series of change initiatives into an organization. The second word, Station, refers to a control station where one could plan, observe, pull levers and steer where the change initiatives are going. The intent of Benefits is to help organizations formulate and manage programs in order to obtain maximum business value from their investments in new technologies and IT-enabled business improvement initiatives. = Project = Before version 5.0, this was known as ManagementSuite, formed of two words: Management, as in project management and Suite, following the same metaphor about name of places. The intent of Project is to provide project managers with the tools, methods and processes to help them deliver projects on time, within budget and with the expected level of quality. The processes and procedures are coherent with the principles and framework proposed in the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK¬Æ) published by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

Chaunskaya Bay, Chaunsky District, can be seen to the southwest. Shmidtovsky District () was an administrative district (raion) of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia, which existed in 1973‚Äì2011.Law #44-OZ As a municipal division, it was, together with Iultinsky Administrative District, incorporated as Iultinsky Municipal District. It was located in the far north of the autonomous okrug and bordered with Iultinsky District in the east, Anadyrsky District in the south, and with Chaunsky District in the west. The area of the district was . Its administrative center was the urban locality (an urban-type settlement) of Mys Shmidta. Population: The population of Mys Shmidta accounted for 33.5% of the district's total population. History Shmidtovsky District was founded in 1973. It was named after Otto Schmidt, a Soviet scientist. Beyond the mainland, the district also incorporated the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Wrangel Island, which straddles the 180¬∞ meridian, and its neighboring island Herald, which in 2004 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list at the same time as Wrangel Island.World Heritage Convention. First wave of new properties added to World Heritage List for 2004 The indigenous population made up around 28% of the total population of the district, which, although lower than in Chukotsky and Providensky Districts, was at the time around average in the autonomous okrug. Signs of earlier habitation by indigenous peoples can be seen at several sites throughout the former district's territory. In the central parts of the region one can still see the Pegtymel rock drawings, where images were carved into the rock by the local inhabitants using quartz. Over a hundred more examples of ancient artwork can be seen on eleven of the Kaikuul cliffs, describing hunting and farming scenes as well as what is thought to be early references to Shamanism.Fute Economy The main economic drivers were gold mining, traditional reindeer herding, and marine hunting. However, there was little mining done in the vicinity of Mys Shmidta, with the three main prospecting teams in the region (Polyarnaya, Arktikaand, and Shakhtar) being based in Leningradsky. =Transportation= Wrangel Island Tundra Although much of the internal region of the district was given over to reindeer pasture, thus creating a significant area of wilderness, connections between the populated places along the coast were present. As with all areas of Siberia and the Russian Far East, there was very limited road transport. There is a road, however, linking Mys Shmidta with Egvekinot. There is also a unpaved road between Mys Shmidta and Komsomolsky, of which is unpaved road and the remaining is snow road. In addition to local road transport, the district was also served by Mys Shmidta Airport, located immediately to the southwest of the settlement. The airport is now employed solely for civilian usage, providing flights to Anadyr. Flights are provided by Chukotavia. The runway is long and wide. The distance to Anadyr by air is . Unlike airports such as the Provideniya Bay Airport, which has always been a civilian airport, or the Iultin Airport, which was constructed specifically to serve the needs of the remote mine nearby, the Mys Shmidta airport was initially part of the ring of forward staging bases used by the Arctic Control Group (OGA) prior to intercontinental ballistic missiles gaining favor as the primary means of long-range defense.GlobalSecurity.org. Information about Mys Shmidta Status changes Before May 2008, Shmidtovsky Administrative District was municipally incorporated as Shmidtovsky Municipal District. In May 2008, Iultinsky and Shmidtovsky Municipal Districts were merged, forming an enlarged Vostochny Municipal District.Law #40-OZ This change, however, did not affect the administrative aspect of these districts. Both Iultinsky and Shmidtovsky Administrative Districts continued to exist separately. In October 2008, the law mandating the change was amended and the name Vostochny was discarded with the combined municipal district being renamed Iultinsky Municipal District. Shmidtovsky Administrative District was itself merged into Iultinsky Administrative District effective June 13, 2011. Climate The climate of the former Shmidtovsky District is more severe than in neighboring Alaska or even as in the neighboring districts and varies significantly throughout the year. Average July temperatures could range from to , and January temperatures from . The lowest temperatures were characteristic for the western part of the region while storms and winds were frequent on the eastern coast. The summer was short but comparatively warm. Divisions =Administrative divisions= Shmidtovsky Administrative District had administrative jurisdiction over two urban-type settlements (Mys Shmidta and Leningradsky) and two rural localities (Billings and Ryrkaypiy). =Municipal= Shmidtovsky Municipal District was abolished in 2008, and all of the municipal formations previously within the district became a part of Iultinsky Municipal District.

Life His father was Joshua Mapletoft, vicar of Margaretting and rector of Wickford, Essex, and his mother Susanna, daughter of John Collet by Susanna, sister of Nicholas Ferrar of Little Gidding, Huntingdonshire. She afterwards married James Chedley, and, dying on 31 October 1657, was buried at Little Gidding. John was born at Margaretting on 15 June 1631. On the death of his father in 1635 he was taken to Little Gidding, where he was brought up by Nicholas Ferrar, his godfather. In 1647 he was sent by his uncle, Robert Mapletoft, to Westminster School, was entered as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 21 May 1648, and was elected to a Westminster scholarship there in 1649. He graduated B.A. in January 1652, M.A. in 1655, and became fellow of his college on 1 October 1653. He was incorporated B.A. at Oxford on 11 July 1654. On 12 May 1652 he was admitted a student of Gray's Inn. From 1658 to 1660 he was tutor to Jocelyne, son of Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland. He then went abroad to study physic. His fellowship expired in 1662, and in 1663 he re-entered the earl's family in England. In 1667 he took his M.D. degree at Cambridge, and was incorporated M.D. at Oxford on 13 July 1669. While practising in London he made the acquaintance of many of the noted men of the time, both physicians and theologians, and came much into contact with the Cambridge latitudinarians at the house of his kinsman, Thomas Firmin. With John Locke, whom he had known at Westminster School, he was for many years on terms of great intimacy. He is said to have introduced him to both Thomas Sydenham and John Tillotson. With Sydenham Mapletoft was for seven years closely associated in medical practice. In 1670 he attended Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex in his embassy to Denmark, and in 1672 was in France with the Dowager Duchess of Northumberland. In 1675 he was chosen Professor of Physic at Gresham College, and in 1676 was again in France with the dowager duchess, then the wife of the Hon. Ralph Montague. He retained his professorship at Gresham College till 10 October 1679, when he retired from medical practice and prepared himself for ordination. He had some scruples about subscribing to the Thirty-nine Articles, and consulted his friend Simon Patrick. But on 3 March 1683 he took both deacon's and priest's orders, having previously been presented to the rectory of Braybrooke in Northamptonshire. This living he held until 1686, and though non-resident was a benefactor to the place. On 4 January 1685 he was chosen lecturer at Ipswich, and on 10 January 1686, on his resigning Braybrooke, vicar of St. Lawrence Jewry in London, where he continued to preach till he was over eighty years of age. He also held the lectureship of St. Christopher for a short time from 1685. In 1689-90 he took the degree of D.D. at Cambridge, and henceforth devoted his life to religion and philanthropy. Mapletoft was an original member of the Company of Adventurers to the Bahamas (4 September 1672), but, being abroad at the time, transferred his share to Locke. In the same year he was using his influence and purse in support of Isaac Barrow's scheme for building a library at Trinity College. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 10 February 1676, was member of council in 1677, 1679, 1690, and 1692, and as long as he practised the medical profession took part in the discussions and experiments. He joined the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in July 1699, early in the second year of its existence. In this connection he was brought into contact with Robert Nelson, with whom he corresponded for some years. He was an original member and active supporter of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (incorporated by charter in 1701), a benefactor to the library and buildings of Sion College, of which he was president in 1707, and one of the commissioners of Greenwich Hospital. The last ten years of Mapletoft's life were spent with his daughter, partly in Oxford and partly in Westminster. His mental and bodily health remained excellent till nearly the end. He died in Westminster on 10 November 1721, in the ninety-first year of his age, and was buried in the chancel of the church of St. Lawrence Jewry. Works Mapletoft's published works, apart from single sermons, include: * Select Proverbs (anon.), London, 1707. * The Principles and Duties of the Christian Religion . . . with a Collection of suitable Devotions [also issued separately], London, 1710, 1712, 1719. * Wisdom from Above (anon.), London, 1714, 2nd part, 1717. * Placita Principalia, seu Sententiae perutiles e Dramaticis fere Poetis, London, 1714. * Placita Principalia et Concilia, seu Sententiae perutiles Philosophorum, London, 1717, 1731. The last two are selections from Greek authors with Latin translations, and were reprinted in 1731. In Appendix xv. to John Ward's 'Lives' (p. 120) are printed three Latin lectures by Mapletoft on the origin of the art of medicine and the history of its invention, under the title Praelectiones in Collegio Greshamensi, Anno Dom. 1675. He wrote the epitaph for the monument to his friend Isaac Barrow in Westminster Abbey. The extent of his share in Sydenham's works has been debated. He is said to have translated from English into Latin his friend Sydenham's Observationes Medicae, published in 1676 (which was dedicated to him by the author), and everything in the edition of Sydenham's works published in 1683, with the exception of the treatise De Hydrope. Family On 18 November 1679 Mapletoft married Rebecca, daughter of Lucy Knightley of Hackney, a Hamburg merchant, and younger brother of the Knightleys of Fawsley in Northamptonshire. His wife died on 18 November 1693, the fourteenth anniversary of their wedding-day. By her he had two sons and one daughter: Robert, born in 1684, became fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge (LL.B. 1702, LL.D. 1707), advocate of Doctors' Commons (12 July 1707), and commissary of Huntingdon; died on 3 December 1716, and was buried in St. Edward's Church, Cambridge. John, born in 1687, became rector of Broughton in Northamptonshire in 1718, and of Byfield in November 1721, holding both livings till 1753, when he resigned Broughton in favour of his son Nathaniel; he married, on 23 November 1721, Ann, daughter of Richard Walker of Harborough, and died at Byfield on 25 May 1763. Elizabeth, married, 20 August 1703, Francis Gastrell, bishop of Chester, and died on 2 February 1761.

Described by Dylan Thomas as ‚Äúthe best of houses in the best of places‚Äù, it is one of many buildings of note in the medieval township. The house was built around 1730, although remodelled inside and out in the Regency period. It features a three-storey, five-bay facade, with the central three bays projecting slightly. The central doorway is surmounted by a pediment; above it are tripartite windows, with the uppermost one in the Venetian style. A broad cornice on the facade conceals the slate roof. Several wings, lower than the main body of the house, project to the rear, one of which dates to the original 18th-century construction. The interiors are mainly of the Regency period and later but include the only example in Carmarthenshire of a Chinese Chippendale staircase. There were formerly a number of outbuildings to the rear of the house, as can be seen in the first-edition Ordnance Survey County Series map (Carmarthen, XLV.14, 1889), and the grounds of Laugharne Castle were formerly landscaped to serve as the house's garden. Two of the surviving outbuildings have been converted to a bed and breakfast and a restaurant. Although the castle is now in the guardianship of Cadw, its title is still with the house. Until recently Castle House was in the ownership of the Starke family, who had held it since the early 19th century, although it is now the private residence of David Thomas and Abi Thomas, daughter of the local artist David Petersen.

Cyclododecane is also used as a volatile binding medium, a temporary binder for sealing and conservation of friable and structurally weak materials, e.g. during excavation and transport of archaeological objects and in art restoration, e.g. to protect water- sensitive parts during cleaning. Due to its relatively slow evaporation in comparison with other volatile binding mediums the layer can last for several weeks. Very pure material has to be used so it does not leave any residue. Cyclododecane can be applied in molten state or dissolved in a nonpolar organic solvent. Other volatile binding mediums in use are camphene, tricyclene and with some limits menthol. Environmental considerations Cyclododecane is persistent in the environment, as it does not biodegrade easily. Cyclododecane is lipophilic, usually present in the environment as adsorbed on the surface of soil particles. It has the potential to bioaccumulate.

The light station was established in 1850, and the present tower and keeper's house were built in 1874. The station was deactivated in 1934 and reactivated in 1987. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The keeper's house now houses the Grindel Point Sailor's Museum and the lighthouse tower is open for tours in the summer. Description and history The town of Islesboro occupies an eponymous island in Penobscot Bay, on the central Maine coast. The island is roughly shaped as two lobes joined by a narrow isthmus. The westernmost point of the island, called Grindel's (or \\"Grindel's\\") Point, is located at the southern tip of a peninsula extending southwest from the southern lobe. The light stands to the west of Ferry Road, near the wharf serving the ferry connecting Islesboro to the mainland at Lincolnville. The lighthouse is a short tapered square brick structure, topped by a lantern house surrounded by a metal deck with rounded railing. A covered passageway, slightly below ground level, connects the tower to the keeper's house, a rectangular wood frame structure with a gable roof. Just northwest of the house stands a wooden boathouse, and a small brick oilhouse stands further north. The light station was authorized by the United States Navy in 1849, and the first tower and keeper's house were completed the following year. These brick structures were deemed beyond repair in 1874, and the present station was built on the foundations of the old one. The title name is the official USCG name and is derived from the name of the second lightkeeper, Francis Grindel. The USCG History site calls it \\"Grindel Point\\". The United States Coast Guard planned to automate the light as early as 1923. After public resistance delayed this, the Coast Guard in 1934 mounted a new light on a steel tower nearby in 1934. The town of Islesboro bought the light for $1,200 and established the Sailors' Memorial Museum there. After considerable public pressure, the Coast Guard reestablished the light in 1987.
