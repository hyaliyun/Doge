It is one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas. It also known as Amrita Nada Bindu Upanishad.() The text exists in two significantly different versions, the North Indian and the South Indian. These manuscripts are respectively attached to the Atharvaveda, or to the Rigveda. Etymology The word Nada, being a Vedic terminology refers to as the unstruck sound or \\"Anahata Nada\\" which is reported as a thin buzzing sound being heard in right ear, and upon whom meditating, a person attains the \\"turya\\" of meditation easily. It is said that this sound has its source in the Anahata Chakra( the fourth Chakra in vedic terminology). Other religions also have same terms for it like \\"shabad\\", \\"Word\\" etc. This scripture tells how to listen to that sound so that to attain a deep state of meditation. History The relative chronology of the text is placed by Mircea Eliade with the ancient Yoga Upanishads. He suggests that it was composed in the same period when the following texts were composed ‚Äì Maitri Upanishad, the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads such as Brahmabindu, Brahmavidya, Tejobindu, Yogatattva, Kshurika, Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu and Amritabindu. These and the Nadabindu text, adds Eliade, were composed earlier than the ten or eleven later yogic Upanishads such as the Yoga-kundali, Varaha and Pashupatabrahma Upanishads.Mircea Eliade (1970), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , pages 128‚Äì129 Gavin Flood dates this text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. Guy Beck dates it to be probably from the pre-Christian era and the earliest document on the Yoga of sacred sound, while Georg Feuerstein suggests that the text is likely from a period in early 1st millennium CE.Georg Feuerstein (1990), Encyclopedia Dictionary of Yoga, Shambala, , page 418 Mikel Burley states that this text does not provide techniques of Hatha Yoga, but probably influenced the later Hatha yoga texts. The Upanishad is also referred to as Nadabindu Upanishad or Nadabindupanisad (‡§®‡§æ‡§¶‡§¨‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ç‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§§).Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, page 429 It is listed at number 38 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. In the Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads, popular in north India, it is listed at number 17 The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 17 in Bibliothica Indica. In the collection of Upanishads under the title \\"Oupanekhat\\", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Amratanada is listed at number 43 and is named anbratnad. Contents The text is composed in poetic verse style. The text, in both versions of the manuscripts, opens with a metaphorical comparison of Atman (soul, self) as a Hamsa bird (swan, goose), comparing both to the Om symbol and the Samkhya theory of three Gunas. It asserts that true Yoga involves meditation and renunciation from all attachments to the worldly cravings. Dharma (ethics), states the text, is a requirement for a Yogi life, and it is notable for describing Om symbol with twelve moras instead of three and half moras commonly found in ancient Indian literature. The yogin contemplates on Omkara, asserts the text, as Hamsa, in twelve Kalas or variations of the four matras (intonations). The variation is produced by the three svara (note on the musical scale), namely Udatta, Anudatta and Svarita. The twelve Kalas, according to Nadabindu text, are Ghosini, Vidyunmali, Patangini, Vayuvegini, Namadheya, Aindri, Vaishnavi, Sankari, Mahati, Dhriti, Nari and Brahmi. The manuscripts of Nadabindu discovered in different parts of India, partially vary in this list. For example, the Calcutta version differs from Poona edition by replacing Dhriti with Dhruva, and Mauni for Nari. The text suggests that a yogin should contemplate and be absorbed in the Om with these Kalas, as it leads one to knowledge of Atman or Self, helps him overcome three types of Karma. The text refers to the Vedanta theory of Ajnana (ignorance) as the cause of bondage, suggesting that a yogin should listen to his inner voice in Siddhasana. A yogin, at the start of his practice, concentrates in the inner side of right ear from inside and, hears many sounds proceeding from those like an ocean and clouds( It is said that this starts from sounds of crickets and other familiar sounds and at higher levels it is Sounds of flute, cymbals and Cloud thunder). These filter out, and over time, he can hear more subtle sounds such as single note of musical instruments at his will, and get absorbed in whichever sound note it wants to, asserts the text. This focus on sound notes help the yogi destroy distractions from other senses and fluctuations of his mind, just like a bee focussed on honey does not care about the odour that surrounds it. Such a yogi does not care about fame or disgrace from others, he does not feel heat or cold, neither joy nor sorrow, he is lost within, in his self, in Brahman-Pranava (Om). The goal of Yoga, asserts the text, is to realize the transcendent Atman, its existence in everyone, and its oneness with Brahman through meditation and absorption into Nada (sound Om).Ellen Goldberg (2002), The Lord Who Is Half Woman: Ardhanarisvara in Indian and Feminist Perspective, State University of New York Press, , pages 84‚Äì87 See also *Amritabindu Upanishad *Dhyanabindu Upanishad *Tejobindu Upanishad *Hatha yoga *Yoga (philosophy) *Yogatattva Upanishad *Yoga Vasistha References Bibliography      * External links *‡§®‡§æ‡§¶-‡§¨‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å ‡§â‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§¶‡•ç One version of the text in Sanskrit, Wikisource Category:Upanishads Category:Sanskrit texts ","title":"Nadabindu Upanishad"},{"id":"26103088","text":"The Sinfonieorchester Basel (Symphony Orchestra Basel; Swiss abbreviation SOB) is a symphony orchestra based in Basel, Switzerland.

The mall opened in 1987 and has since grown to be St. Charles County's largest shopping center. Mid Rivers Mall includes over 140 shops. The anchor stores are Vintage Stock, Macy's, Dillard's, Marcus Cinemas, JCPenney, and Dick's Sporting Goods. There is one vacant anchor store that was once Sears. The mall is owned by CBL Properties, which acquired the property in 2007 from the Westfield Group. History Famous-Barr opened their store in 1981 on the site of the future Mid Rivers Mall. The mall was finished in 1987 with two anchor stores, Dillard's and Famous-Barr, as well as a food court; a 6-screen cinema opened in 1988. The 1990 expansion of Mid Rivers Mall included a new anchor store, Sears. Another expansion of Mid Rivers Mall in 1996 added the fourth anchor, JCPenney, which moved from nearby Mark Twain Mall in St. Charles. In 1999, Wehrenberg demolished the mall's 6-screen theater and built a new 14-screen megaplex. Upon the acquisition of The May Department Stores Company by Federated Department Stores, Famous-Barr was rebranded Macy's in 2006. Dick's Sporting Goods opened at the mall between JCPenney and Sears in 2008. In February 2018, the mall began offering relatively inexpensive weekly lease rates so new retail businesses can test use of physical retail space. The initiative drives foot traffic to the mall while potentially bringing in long-term tenants. On August 6, 2019, it was announced that Sears will be closing this location as part of a plan to close 26 stores nationwide. The store closed on October 27, 2019. Crime and legal issues In September 2017, the mall owner sued former tenant Max & Erma's, alleging that the franchisee owed over $680,000 in rent, interest, and fees after vacating their nearly mall space in August; its 2011 lease was to expire in January 2022. In December 2017, a 59-year-old man was attacked and his vehicle carjacked during late Saturday morning hours near the mall's Dillard's store. In July 2018, it was reported that a 33-year-old man had been charged with invasion of privacy after he was caught attempting to record a woman while she was in a dressing room at the mall's Windsor's Fashions store. Also in July 2018, 98 T-shirts, valued at nearly $4,000, were stolen from a Mid Rivers Mall department store.

Radiocentro CMQ. Live radio tramsmission of La Tremenda Corte in one of the Radio CMQ Studio. From left to right: Erdwin Fern√°ndez, Mim√≠ Cal, Adolfo Otero, Miguel √Ångel Herrera, An√≠bal de Mar y Leopoldo Fern√°ndez. La Tremenda Corte was a radio comedy show produced from the Radiocentro CMQ Building in Havana, Cuba. The scripts were written by C√°stor Vispo, a Spaniard who became Cuban citizen. The show was aired nonstop from 1942 to 1961. Later, the format of the show was adapted for a TV sitcom in Monterrey, Mexico, however, only three and a half seasons were produced from 1966 to 1969. History Origins C√°stor Vispo was born in A Coru√±a, Spain. He left his hometown at the age of 18, shortly after the Spanish Civil War broke out, to join his family in Cuba. While working at the El Universal newspaper, Vispo used his free time to write. His stories were closely related to the Cuban culture of the period, encompassing written press, theater and Cuban radio. Popularity ‚ÄúLa Tremenda Corte‚Äù, was the work of this clever and prolific comedy writer Castor Vispo definitely fused with speech and Cuban folk psychology. Both Vispo as the production team were given the task of finding local comedians who would shed an humorous light, in 1941 (during WWII) and help people to forget the hardships of that time. Soon they found Leopoldo Fern√°ndez (Tres Patines), a talented comedian who was already recognized in radio spots and theatre, and his inseparable friend, Anibal de Mar. The duo had already achieved popularity as the comedy duo Pototo y Filomeno, and they would bring parts of their act into the new show. The rest of the cast came from tests with other less well-known comedians, but equally outstanding. RHC radio The program began broadcasting on radio station RHC-Cadena Azul on January 7, 1942. It was owned by Amado Trinidad Velasco since 1941 (RHC belonged to the famous cigarette company Trinidad and Brothers). In 1947, ‚ÄúLa Tremenda Corte‚Äù like several other programs of its time, was transferred to rival station CMQ Radio advertisers and sponsors, seeking greater competitive advantage. The programs were broadcast live back then, three times per week from Monday to Friday at 8:30 pm and were sponsored by a firm of perfumery and soaps. CMQ Radio La Tremenda Corte aired uninterrupted from 1942 to 1961 (first RHC Cadena Azul and later at QMC), and its sole writer was Vispo. Despite such strenuous work for his imagination, Vispo always managed to pull through during this period. Over 360 shows are estimated to have been recorded, many of which are still heard on radio, but a few such episodes have never left Cuba and little is therefore known about them. Of all these missing radio shows were recorded at station CMQ in Havana, between 1947 and 1961, no one knows how many still survive, and they are considered rare and invaluable for fans and collectors of the series. In the peak of their success, the performances of the cast were taken to countries such as Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Panama and the Dominican Republic, where they were acclaimed. TV series In 1955 the program received a second wind, becoming the TV space comedy ‚ÄúThe show of Pototo & Filomeno‚Äù CMQ through TV, where Leopoldo Fernandez (‚ÄúPototo‚Äù) made a very similar to ‚ÄúTres Patines‚Äù with again his teammate Anibal de Mar (Filomeno). The space consisted of skits and songs with orchestral music, a forerunner of its kind on the island of Cuba. Its success prompted the couple‚Äôs two music recordings and a second film (‚ÄúOl√© Cuba!‚Äù) In 1957. The show was introduced in the Sierra and the Montmartre cabarets in Havana. All this occurred parallel to his work with ‚ÄúLa Tremenda Corte‚Äù, but much of the public still identified with their radio characterizations. Radio show cancelled Beginning in 1960 production took a drastic turn for the show as a result of the revolution headed by Fidel Castro. The show had been adapted previously to play in local theatres to some controversy, since the actors (Leopoldo Fern√°ndez especially) were vocal political critics both off and on stage. Castro's regime, with its rigid Marxist tendency in those years, showed its displeasure with the existence of comedy shows on the broadcast media, especially when political leaders started to become the butt of jokes. 1960 and 1961 were particularly difficult for the cast, as the government began sending sympathizers to chant Communist slogans and disrupt the performances by any means necessary. Then in 1961 a decree was issued in the island placing all theater, radio and TV troupes under the purview of the state's Censorship Commission. Fern√°ndez was arrested over a shooting in a performance and had to serve a 27-day house arrest sentence for which no further explanation was offered. After his release Fern√°ndez is said to have made a short comic piece where he played ‚ÄúPototo‚Äù while he and another actor reviewed a file of Cuban presidents' photos to install them on the wall. The other player showed a photo of Fulgencio Batista and Fern√°ndez said to him: ‚ÄúThrow this one away.‚Äù The other actor continued showing different pictures to Pototo's unchanging reply: ‚Äì ‚ÄúThrow this one away too‚Ä¶‚Äù Finally, the assistant grabbed a photo of Fidel Castro. Leopoldo watched it, showed it to the audience and went to the wall as he said with his characteristic ironic humor: ‚Äì ‚ÄúAllow me ‚Äî I want to hang this one myself‚Ä¶‚Äù. The joke, which spread far and wide and was repeated everywhere, was said to end with an assertion that this line had caused his detention ‚Äî and would cause his later self-exile from Cuba in the same year. However, this story was later denied in Miami by Fern√°ndez, who, on hearing it from an alleged theater hand present at that performance, corrected the storyteller with visible displeasure and said: \\"Gentlemen, had I done and said those things, I would not be here to tell you the story‚Ä¶ \\". Whatever the case, Cuban authorities finally shut down both the stage version of La Tremenda Corte and Pototo y Filomeno in Cuba, and in early 1962, the Cuban government seized the Radiocentro CMQ Building and cancelled all comedy shows that were on air. This caused the main cast of ‚ÄúLa Tremenda Corte‚Äù (with the exception of the production team, C√°stor Vispo included) to leave Cuba that year for Miami, never to return. The self-exile was driven by economic reasons, never by ideological differences. In fact, none of the cast team expressed in that moment any political affinity and they decided to stay besides the facts that were addressing the Cuban society, even if they were living in a foreign country. In those times actors did not receive income from the copyrights of the program, as it happens today, for this reason Abel Mestre, (who had been executive of company CMQ before being expropriated by the Castro Brothers) bought many of the chapters from La Tremenda Corte for a truly derisory sum. Later he offered them for sale to many of the main Latin American radio stations of those years. The sale value was estimated in those years in $20 U.S. by episode, or more than $7.000 U.S. the totality of the episodes which still engravings are conserved, and are worth an exorbitant amount nowadays. For television Mexico The radio show would return to life in Mexico in the mid-1960s when Monterrey-based radio station XEFB-AM began transmitting episodes recorded in Cuba. The radio broadcasts were warmly welcomed by the audience. The success motivated a TV adaptation, and Televisi√≥n Independiente de M√©xico (Cadena TIM) broadcast the first episodes of the small-screen series in 1966 via Monterrey Channel 6 (XET-TV 6) and Mexico City Channel 8 (XHTM Canal 8). Cadena TIM had by then a superb show schedule, having hired the best Cuban creative talents of the time. The TV series, however, also suffered from the limitations of the age, like the painted-cardboard scenery and the grainy picture afforded by the rudimentary black-and-white video equipment. The last season featured live audiences, earning the show greater credibility and underscoring the performers' improvisational skills and stage presence. La Tremenda Corte was one of the first TV comedy shows exported from Mexico to various Latin American countries. Of the original radio performers, only Leopoldo Fern√°ndez (who also wrote the scripts in the absence of Vispo) and An√≠bal de Mar reprised their roles, which were central and irreplaceable to the plot. Mim√≠ Cal (Nananina) and Adolfo Otero (Rudecindo), two regulars from the original series, by then exiled in Miami, declined the offer to participate. Their roles were taken by Norma Z√∫√±iga (as Nananina) and Florencio Castello (Rudecindo). The rest of the cast were Cuban and Mexican actors mostly unknown to audiences because the station was unwilling to pay high salaries. Some, like a young Alfonso Zayas (as Casimiro, a very occasional character), first acted on TV on the show. This was also the case of Tonina Jackson, a wrestler active in the 1950s and 1960s, who also acted in a few episodes. The TV show was cancelled in mid-1969, suffering from unsustainable production costs and a lack of strong sponsors coupled with the obvious technical limitations. The fourth season was left unfinished, despite the show's success elsewhere in the continent and the performers' efforts to keep it on the air. Meanwhile, Leopoldo Fern√°ndez was cast in the Mexican film Las v√≠rgenes de la nueva ola (1969, Fernando Cort√©s), filmed in Miami. This was his first color film ‚Äî and his first ever without An√≠bal de Mar. Peru In mid-1969 Panamericana Televisi√≥n (Channel 5 Peru) bought all 260 filmed chapters of and the rights to La Tremenda Corte and later hired Fern√°ndez to lead El Guardia Tres Patines, a spin-off of the original show. Fern√°ndez was cast in the title role, a clueless police officer of Caribbean flavor, and Antonio Salim as his boss, Sergeant Bonifacio Palomino, along with other Peruvian comedians like Jorge Montoro and Anita Saravia. The show was very short-lived, failing to garner wider distribution or much importance abroad. One final adaptation for Panamericana was the obscure, less fortunate Tres Patines en su salsa (1970), of which little recorded matter survives. Fern√°ndez quit Lima after this. International relevance La tremenda corte has been one of the most widely listened radio shows in many American countries; it has been so successful, it remains on air even today on many radio stations, mainly for audiences in Mexico, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, the Caribbean (particularly in the Dominican Republic), Florida in the United States and the rest of the Americas; further, also the TV versions are still been transmitted in certain channels of Mexico, Peru, Ecuador and Panama. The head of the Dominican Republic's Ministry of Education attempted to get the show taken off the air, concerned that children listening to the show would adopt Tres Patines' dialect. The attempt was unsuccessful, and he soon found himself dismissed from his post following public outcry. Miami‚Äôs Mega television Canal 22, announced that from January 15, 2007 would have a daily emission of the series, in south Florida. In Puerto Rico, the WPAB radio network transmits two episodes weekdays from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm, retaining a considerable audience. Tributes In 1998 Cuban comedians did a tribute to the show within the program \\"¬øY t√∫ de qu√© te r√≠es? (And what are you laughing at?) Of Cubavision, and took to the air a remake starring, among others, by Ulises Toirac as Trespatines, Carlos Otero as the Judge, Geonel Martin as Secretary, and Edith Massola as Nananine. This sketch was the closing of the program and had enormous popularity.

They are crimes in which Jose Candelario ‚ÄúTres Patines‚Äù has made victim to Rudecindo or Nananina with some of his thefts, deceits or knavery, and these demand him before a judge in that correctional court. The daily subjects turn on misunderstandings that Tres Patines causes matching of words, always distorting for his benefit the double meaning that some phrases could have. Tres Patines in most cases inadvertently reveal his malicious intent. In one famous sketch, he pretend that he sells a parrot \\"speaking exceedingly\\". When the customer complains that the parrot doesn't speak, he explains to the judge that the one who speaks exceedingly is himself, Tres Patines, not the parrot. Meanwhile the judge is a flaming hypochondriac who is always seeing doctors and discussing remedies. Everyone is concerned about his health since the worse he is feeling the more everyone in the courtroom would be slapped with fines and jail time. Anecdotes The expression \\"A la Reja\\" (‚ÄúTo the bars!‚Äù) ‚Äîtypical of Tres Patines whenever they called him to appear, it was said in Cuba to those who were in prison already, in other words, was locked up in his cell, and in addition people came to look for him, could be a relative, his lawyer, or whoever. Then, so that the prisoner approached the bars because they wanted to talk to him, it was said to him. ‚Äî‚ÄúFulano of so‚Ä¶ to the bars! ‚Äù -. This gives to understand that the character basically spend most his time as a condemned in jail. The anecdotes of Tres Patines always leave in doubt the language of Cervantes that never says the words as they are. In fact, the success of his character, lay in the easy way he used the language for his own benefit.

The convention also seeks to promote police and judicial co-operation to prevent, investigate and punish the financing of such acts. As of October 2018, the treaty has been ratified by 188 states; in terms of universality, it is therefore one of the most successful anti-terrorism treaties in history. Content Article 2.1 defines the crime of terrorist financing as the offense committed by \\"any person\\" who \\"by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and willfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out\\" an act \\"intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.\\"United Nations 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (Terrorist Financing Convention), art. 2.1 State parties to this treaty also commit themselves to the freezing and seizure of funds intended to be used for terrorist activities and to share the forfeited funds with all state parties. Moreover, state parties commit themselves not to use bank secrecy as a justification for refusing to co-operate in the suppression of terrorist financing. Entry into force and ratifications The treaty entered into force on 10 April 2002. It has been ratified by 188 states, which includes all but eight member states of the United Nations plus the Cook Islands, the Holy See, and Niue. It has not been ratified by Burundi, Chad, Eritrea, Iran, Somalia, South Sudan, and Tuvalu. (Burundi and Somalia have signed the convention but have not yet ratified it.)

Technical description The raga is of Shadava-Sampoorna nature, i.e., in its arohana (ascent) six notes are used (D is excluded), whereas the avarohana (descent) uses All seven notes. All the swaras used in this raga are shuddha except for N which is sometimes komal (n). The usage of komal (n) brings in the characteristics of Khamaj thaat. However, shuddha N in the avarohana is quite frequently used in north Indian style of performing this raga. Arohana: 'P 'N S R G S R M P N S' . Avarohana: S' P D M G S R G S 'N 'P 'N S R G S . Pakad:'P 'N S R G S R P M G S 'N The vadi swara is R, and the samavadi is P . Samay (Time) The raga is to be sung during the second quarter of the night (dwitiya prahar). Further information It is a very melodious raga, and whereas heavy classical genres like Khyals are often based on this raga, light classical genres are more popular in Tilak Kamod. Rarely, a tinge of Komal Ni is also used in this raga. The raga is very close to ragas like Desh, and hence requires a skilful rendition for the differences to be distinct to the listener.

He was disciple of authors T.N. Srikantaiah and Kuvempu. His literary career spans over decades in which he wrote over thirty-four biographies in Kannada language and other works including children's literature. He campaigned for the promotion of Kannada language. He had received Pampa Prashasti (1998), Padma Shri (2001) and the Karnataka Ratna (2008) awards for his contributions in literature and education. He became a centenarian in 2015 and died on 30 May 2016.  Early life  Gowda was born on 6 July 1915 in the village called Chakkere in the Channapatna taluk of Ramanagara district in Karnataka state. He was born in a poor family and had three siblings. As his parents could not afford to educate all, only his eldest brother went to school and Gowda would graze goats. Having passion for education, Gowda would let go goats on their own and instead come and listen to teachers from outside near a school window. He recollects that on one such day when the goats entered a wealthy landlord's farm and destroyed the crop, his father beat him and the school principal then rescued him and admitted him in third standard, also providing him with uniform and books.  Education, career and activities  Gowda later went on to study in Bangalore for intermediate classes and completed his BA in Mysore. He wanted to do his BA with History as his major subject but opted for Kannada when he came to know that notable author Kuvempu would be teaching it. Gowda had admired Kuvempu's works long before getting associated with him as his student. After completing BA in 1941, he went on to do post graduates MA in Kannada. With little scope of getting a lectureship in any college, he took up a clerical job at the Secretariat in Vidhan Soudha at Bangalore. He concurrently studied law but did not pursue it as career when he got post of Kannada lecturer at the Central College, Bangalore. After three years, he went on to teach at Maharaja's College, Mysore. Here, he again was associated with Kuvempu and later credited him for his \\"academic and spiritual enrichment\\". Gowda served as the Vice Chancellor of Mysore University from 1969 to 1975 for consecutive two terms. In his tenure as VC he started various post graduates courses in Home Sciences, Criminology, Law and Journalism at the university. He was known for his sharp criticism of the then government policies. While reappointing him as the VC for the second term, the then state governor Mohan Lal Sukhadia requested \\"please try to remember that when you criticize the government, do so mildly\\". He also wished to start an Afro-Dravidian Institute of post graduate studies called \\"The Kuvempu Vidyavardhaka Trust\\", which did not happen because of inadequate government funding. Gowda actively campaigned for promotion of Kannada language. Various encyclopaedias were published in Kannada after his efforts. Kannada was also used in examinations conducted by Karnataka Public Service Commission. He wrote over thirty-four biographies in Kannada language of eminent personalities like Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Ram Manohar Lohia, Motilal Nehru, Basaveshwara and more. He also wrote books for children on Albert Einstein, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rabindranath Tagore, Marie Curie and more. He published various books on Kuvempu and Soundarya Yogi Kuvempu narrates Gowda's experiences with Kuvempu. In 1970 he chaired the Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana which was held at Bangalore. On 31 January 2006, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Gowda observed a dawn- to-dusk fast seeking classical language status for Kannada. Earlier he had fasted once before for same cause and also threatened to return his Padma Shri that was conferred on him in 2001. Eventually he did not return the award as he was hopeful of a favourable reply from the then President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. In 2014, ex-minister P. G. R. Sindhia requested government to confer upon him the title of poet laureate (Rashtrakavi) for his contributions to the Kannada language. In October 2015, Gowda and five others returned the Aralu Sahitya prize, awarded to them by the Kannada Sahitya Parishat and Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation in 2011, to protest the perceived delays into the investigation of writer M. M. Kalburgi's death.  Personal life and death  Gowda was married to Savithramma. Their son J. Shashidhar Prasad was also Vice Chancellor of University of Mysore. Gowda became a centenarian in 2015. In a felicitation program organized by Kannada Catholic Christian Association on the occasion, he mentioned that he had been worshipping Jesus Christ for past 25 years along with all the Hindu Gods. This can be seen at the pooja room at his house where there were photos and idols of Hindu Gods and also a Rosary he had got from Vatican on visiting there.He died in Mysore on 30 May 2016 from heart failure at the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research where he was admitted on 28 May. His last rites were performed at the Kuvempu Trust, Mysore. His body was laid in repose at his residence in Jayalakshmipuram and at the Chandrakala Hospital. Politicians and writers like H. D. Deve Gowda, H. D. Kumaraswamy, S. M. Krishna and M. Veerappa Moily paid tributes to him.  Awards and accolades  Gowda received his first doctorate in 1975 from the Karnatak University, Dharwad. In 1998, he received doctorate from Mysore University and in 2006 an honorary doctorate was accorded to him by the Kuvempu University at Shimoga. He also received Nadoja Award conferred by the Hampi University. On his centenary, a 30-minutes documentary was made by director Kesari Harvoo for the Department of Kannada and Culture. * Pampa Prashasti in 1998Javare Gowda chosen for Pampa award * Padma Shri in 2001 * Gorur Award in 2003 * Karnataka Ratna in 2008 See also * Kannada literature  References Category:1915 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Recipients of the Karnataka Ratna Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in literature & education Category:People from Ramanagara district Category:Kannada people Category:Kannada-language writers Category:University of Mysore alumni Category:University of Mysore faculty Category:Indian centenarians Category:20th-century Indian educational theorists Category:Educators from Karnataka Category:Writers from Karnataka Category:20th-century Indian biographers Category:Indian children's writers Category:20th-century Indian novelists Category:Heads of universities and colleges in India ","title":"Javare Gowda"},{"id":"26103356","text":"DOR or Dor or DoR may refer to: Brand * DOR, also known as Dor Raw Luxury is a mediterranean slow fashion brand that work with linen.

The waves are seen both in the ECG and in continuous blood pressure curves and have a frequency about 0.1 Hz (10-second waves). These waves were originally described by Siegmund Mayer, Ewald Hering and Ludwig Traube hence originally called \\"Traube‚ÄìHering‚ÄìMayer waves\\". Mayer waves can be defined as arterial blood pressure (AP) oscillations at frequencies slower than respiratory frequency and which show the strongest, significant coherence (strength of linear coupling between fluctuations of two variables in the frequency domain) with efferent sympathetic nervous activity (SNA). In humans, AP oscillations which meet these properties have a characteristic frequency of approx. 0.1 Hz; 0.3 Hz in rabbits and 0.4 Hz in rats. The hemodynamic basis of Mayer waves are oscillations of the sympathetic vasomotor tone of arterial blood vessels, because Mayer waves are abolished or at least strongly attenuated by pharmacological blockade of alpha-adrenoreceptors. Within a given biological species, their frequency is fairly stable; in humans it has been shown that this frequency does not depend on gender, age or posture. It has been suggested that Mayer waves trigger the liberation of endothelium- derived nitric oxide (NO) by cyclic changes of vascular shear stress which could be beneficial to end organ functioning. Mayer waves are correlated with heart rate variability. Takalo et al.

English band   First English band  The Tomcats were a band from Perivale, England in the early to mid sixties. The founder members were Tom Newman (later founder of Virgin Records with Richard Branson, and producer of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells), Pete Cook (later luthier to John Entwistle, and creator of the 'Ned Callan' guitar range with Tom Newman), Allan James (later bass player with psychedelic band July with Newman and Jackson), and Chris Jackson, drummer - (The Devil Rides Out).  Second English band  In the late 1960s, there was a British band called The Tomcats, which were produced by Bill Wyman, bass player with The Rolling Stones. They made some recordings, including renditions of The Stones' hits, such as \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\". Terry Taylor, who was one of the guitarists for the band, is currently a member of Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings.  American band  Tomcats was the name of Brian Setzer's first rockabilly group, before transforming to the widely known Stray Cats. With Brian Setzer on guitar and vocals, Gary Setzer on drums and Bob Beecher on bass, the trio began to play clubs at Long Island in 1977. At the time Brian Setzer and Bob Beecher were also participating at another group, named the Bloodless Pharaohs, which played \\"art rock\\" music (as described by Gary Setzer). While the Bloodless Pharaohs were playing in and out New York, the Tomcats were still holding forth out on Long Island developing the sound and style that would mark the Stray Cats. The Bloodless Pharaohs were going in one direction, while Brian Setzer was more interested in rockabilly. This resulted in the break-up of the Tomcats. Afterwards, Brian Setzer began working with a couple of Long Island buddies, Jim McDonnell (later known as Slim Jim Phantom, playing drums) and Lee Drucker (later known as Lee Rocker, playing bass). In the summer of 1980, the trio sold their equipment and moved to London, taking the name Stray Cats. High School Confidential Recorded live at TKs Place on May 24, 1980.

A former chief of staff to party leader Tony Leon, Harris was the party's national events manager during the 2009 general election campaign, and was subsequently elected to Parliament aged 29, initially to the National Council of Provinces where he served as the Western Cape's Provincial Whip before being moved to the National Assembly in a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle. He has been characterised as the \\"sexiest man in politics\\".\\"Sexist Man in Politics - Tim Harris on The Anne Hirsch Show S03 E08\\", The Anne Hirsch Show  Background  Harris was born in Cape Town but grew up in KwaZulu-Natal, where he attended all-boys Hilton College. He returned to the Western Cape in 1998 to complete an undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Cape Town, majoring in English Literature and Economics. He then completed an honours degree in economics in 2001 while he was Chair of UCT Rag. After briefly working at an investment bank in Johannesburg, Harris again returned to Cape Town to complete his Masters in Economics. In late 2007 and early 2008, he travelled with two friends up Africa's west coast on the first surfing trip between Cape Town and London by the west coast route, garnering international attention in the process. He told BBC News of the episode: In November 2009, he told The Leader World magazine: On 26 March 2011, he married his wife, Cara Louise. They had their first daughter, Neve, in June 2012.  Politics  While completing a master's degree in Economics, his lecturer recommended him to the DA, which had been scouting for people with the necessary skills to join the party's Economic Policy team in preparation for the 2004 general elections. He joined the Democratic Alliance as a parliamentary economics researcher, and has been responsible for developing the party's economic policies. In 2005, he was appointed as Chief of Staff for then-party leader, Tony Leon. Upon returning to politics in 2009, he was appointed campaign events manager for the Democratic Alliance's 2009 election campaign, and was subsequently elected to the National Council of Provinces for the Western Cape. In the National Council of Provinces, Harris sat on the Select Committee on Finance, and held the positions of Party Whip and Provincial Whip. He served on the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry. From 2011 until 2012, he warned about a technological crisis at the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC), noting that the commission had \\"capacity and managed problems\\" which had resulted in a backlog and slow processing of registrations. He subsequently moved to the Standing Committee on Finance, and became the Parliamentary counsellor to then-parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko. Harris did not stand for re-election in the 2014 parliamentary elections. He instead became the Director of Trade and Investment in the Office of the Executive Mayor at the City of Cape Town until March 2015, then assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer at Wesgro, the official Investment and Trade promotion agency for the Western Cape. Union federation COSATU criticised Harris' move to Wesgro, accusing the DA of \\"cadre deployment\\", and claiming that Harris was incompetent for the position because he had demonstrated a \\"white brain deficit\\" in Parliament. He is also the vice president for Africa on the bureau of Liberal International, the global group of liberal parties, and sits on the board of SiliconCape, Cape Town's technology industry promotion body.  Positions  Harris sees economic growth as paramount to solving South Africa's problems.

It first aired on 4 February 2010 on E4 in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. The episode was written by Ed Hime, and was directed by Philippa Langdale. The episode focuses on the character of Emily Fitch (Kathryn Prescott), her continuing romantic relationship with girlfriend Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) as well as family problems with her mother Jenna Fitch. Emily decides to investigate the suicide of Sophia Moore, the girl who killed herself in the first episode, suspecting Naomi cheated on her with Sophia. Plot The episode begins with Emily in Naomi's house, looking at her girlfriend's pictures. A package arrives containing a pair of goggles that Naomi has bought for Emily, telling her not to ever forget that she loves her. The couple uses Emily's moped and visits the Fitch house, where Rob Fitch is cleaning out the garage. Emily talks to her mother, Jenna Fitch who insist they have a conversation about Emily's future. Emily brushes her off, and rides off to Roundview college with Naomi. The police turn up and they are both called in to be interviewed. Their names were listed by the family as close friends of Sophia's, even though they'd never met her. Emily learns that Naomi was dealing powder with Cook the night of the suicide and sold some to Sophia to pay for the motorbike goggles she bought her. Effy returns to college and lets Freddie know he's the one she's been thinking about all summer. Behind Naomi's back, Emily visits Sophia's family to find out more about the dead girl. She discovers that the Sophia claimed to be best friends with Naomi and Emily. While looking around Sophia's bedroom Emily discovers that Sophia was gay and she finds and takes a wooden box and a university prospectus with a key inside. She leaves and later, when flicking through the prospectus, she finds a photo of Sophia laughing with Naomi. She realises that Naomi did in fact know the dead girl and suspects that she might have cheated on her with Sophia. Emily interrupts Naomi's class by slamming a picture of Sophia and Naomi taken at the University Open Day, making the latter walk out of class. The two argue about lying and Naomi admits that she indeed met Sophia at a University open day which she was attending behind Emily's back. She insists they just talked and that nothing had happened between them. Still a bit doubtful, Emily tells her about they key she found and Naomi believes it is for Sophia's locker at the army base. They go to the army base and open it and inside they find a shrine to Naomi. They discover that Sophia was infatuated with Naomi and Emily makes up with her, having sex with Naomi in an army storage closet. Later, Emily has a falling out with her mother and decides to move out. Katie begs her to stay but Emily still leaves. Emily moves in with Naomi and they seem to have put everything behind them. However, when they go to a party later on, Emily becomes suspicious again when Naomi starts talking to other girls. Cook sees Effy and Freddie kissing at the party and takes his anger out on a fellow party-goer and ends up headbutting JJ also. At dawn, Emily takes Sophia's wooden box and goes back to the club where Sophia died to meet Sophia's brother, Matt, to open up the box. Emily believes the box contains evidence that proves Naomi's affair with Sophia. Soon after Matt arrives, Naomi turns up and asks Emily to forget all about Sophia and Emily tells her that she can't leave it. Matt runs to the roof and Emily follows him. Up on the roof they open the box and find Sophia's sketchbook. Through Sophia's drawings that depict her one-day affair with Naomi, Emily finds out that Naomi did in fact cheat on her. A distraught Emily leaves the roof with Naomi crying and calling after her. Emily returns home and tearfully tells her father that Naomi had cheated on her. As he consoles her, Rob tells her that he once cheated on Jenna, and that she should not worry as it gets better after its worse. Emily goes back to Naomi's house, reading a note on the front door saying, \\"I'll do anything\\". The episode ends with Emily walking through the front door, seemingly following her father's advice. Production Lily Loveless and Kathryn Prescott have hinted in interviews that series 4 was about their characters \\"being a fully fledge couple\\" with Loveless saying the previous series was just \\"the chase\\". Prescott said that viewers were left with the impression of them \\"living happily ever after\\" but this series had Naomi \\"clearly messing around in that happy summer\\". After reading the script, Loveless felt \\"very sad that Naomi cheated\\". Prescott commented that she \\"thought Naomi was a bitch\\" for cheating, pointing out costar Loveless would agree as well. Loveless commented that she thought Naomi \\"cheated as a way of escapism\\" as she was not the kind of person who has relationships.Making of Episode 2 Director Philippa Langdale told Loveless and Prescott to not look into the locker containing Sophia's shrine to Naomi before filming as to get the full effect of being \\"properly weirded out\\" on the first take. When the locker opened on the first take, Loveless wanted to laugh \\"because it was so mental.\\" \\"Making of Episode 2 \\". e4.

It is a communal organization, teaching a form of evangelical Christianity.  Beginnings  In the 1970s, with its headquarters in New York, it developed into a controversial network of churches with 10,000 members and 110 communes at its peak, but only a few hundred members in later years. The Concise Guide to Today's Religions and Spirituality, James K. Walker, Harvest House Publishers, 2007 . Retrieved February 5, 2010. Traill underwent a conversion experience in the early 1970s in Allentown, joined a Pentecostal church from which he was expelled, and began teaching Bible and developing a following. He changed the name of the \\"Forever Family\\" to the \\"Church of Bible Understanding\\" in 1976. Ex-members complained that they worked for very low wages, with all the money going to the church. The group had a communal lifestyle, with Traill maintaining that only he can understand the true meaning of the words of God. Traill encourages his group members to break off contact with their families. Over time, the members decreased in number. The group has been accused of being a cult, and it has been estimated that Traill became a millionaire from it. Rev. Bruce Ritter of Covenant House accused The Church of Bible Understanding of enticing 17 youth out of the shelter with promises of salvation, and a state court enjoined them from housing or transporting youth under age 18 without parental permission.  Business Ventures  With a carpet-cleaning business, \\"Christian Brothers Carpet Cleaning\\", they were the inspiration for Seinfelds \\"Sunshine Carpet Cleaning Cult\\". They also started a used-van business as a commercial venture. The group's only successful venture is Olde Good Things, New York City-based retail stores selling architectural salvage goods and antiques. In 2017, the stores funnelled $6.8 million to the Church of Bible Understanding, according to the nonprofit‚Äôs tax filing for that year. https://nypost.com/2020/02/22/haiti-orphanage-ravaged-by-deadly-fire-linked- to-cult-known-for-nyc-antique-stores/  Haitian Orphanages  In November 2013, the Associated Press investigated claims that the church was at fault for running sub-standard housing for orphans in Haiti after the two homes the church runs received a failing grade from the Haitian agency that monitors orphanages. \\"...Even though they claim in IRS filings to be spending around $2.5 million annually, the home for boys and girls was so dirty and overcrowded during recent inspections that the government said it shouldn't remain open.\\"http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_289563/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=RuECWsQu On February 14, 2020, one \\"orphanage\\", run by the organization in Haiti, burned down, killing 15 children; two burned to death and the others died from smoke inhalation, according to a BBC World News report. The cause was alleged to be candles having being lit, the facility's generator being inoperative. Stewart Traill, the long-time leader of the group, died in 2018.

The sponsor of the nature park, which was founded in 1975, is the state of Lower Saxony. The park extends along the Weser valley between Rinteln and Hamelin and includes parts of the Schaumburg Land, Calenberg, Lippe and Pyrmont Uplands from Bad Nenndorf in the north to Bad Pyrmont in the south, B√ºckeburg and Bad Eilsen in the west and Bad M√ºnder and Osterwald in the east. Its highest elevation is in the S√ºntel hills. Location Bordered in the north by the forested ridges of the B√ºckeberg and the Deister, the nature park covers almost from the eastern Weser Hills, Harrl and S√ºntel running along both sides of the River Weser southwards to the Ith ridge, the Osterwald and the Th√ºster Berg, through a very varied landscape of wooded, rolling hills and small valleys with a myriad streams and rivers. In the S√ºntel, the Ith and on the Kanstein rocky crags tower over the countryside. A colourful mix of nature reserves and protected landscapes, towns, several spas and small villages and castles of the Weser Renaissance period mean that the nature park is a popular local recreation and holiday destination in the north German region. Features Architecture Architectural sights in the area include the: * Weser Renaissance buildings, like the castles of H√§melschenburg and Schw√∂bber * Medieval market place in the former university town of Rinteln * Old town centres (Altst√§dte) of B√ºckeburg of Hamelin * Diverse spa towns of Bad Eilsen, Bad Nenndorf, Bad M√ºnder am Deister and Bad Pyrmont * Numerous early medieval churches, abbeys, convents and town walls Nature Notable nature areas include the: * nature reserve of Hohenstein on the S√ºntel * nature reserve of Saubrink/Oberberg Forest * nature reserve of Weser Hills Crest (Kamm des Wesergebirges) * very rare, native dwarf beeches (S√ºntelbuchen) * Dripstone caves The most northerly examples of Hartstein rock in Germany occur in the Weser Uplands. As a result the landscapes and natural regions of the Weser hills are home to numerous quarries belonging to several companies that extract corallian and oolitic Hartstein. These include the Messingsberg near Steinbergen, the W√ºlpker-Egge near B√ºckeburg and the Papenbrink near Kleinenbremen in the Weser Hills; as well as the Riesenberg near Langenfeld/Hessisch-Oldendorf and the Mattenberg near Hamelspringe in the S√ºntel.

Research at the school is also to a high degree practice- based, i.e. based on cooperation with architectural practices located internationally and locally. The high concentration of architectural practices in Aarhus provides a sound basis for this cooperation.Arkitekturklyngen i √Örhus, p. 14 The Aarhus School of Architecture is an educational institution under the Danish Ministry for Science, Innovation and Higher Education.  School buildings  The school is situated in the N√∏rre Stenbro neighborhood on N√∏rreport. The campus comprises the listed building known as Raae's House () from 1798 and a newer building from 1997 with auditorium and an exhibition hall. Raae's House is a brick building in Neoclassical style built by Hans Fridrich Raae, one of the foremost merchants in the city during the 18th century. It was originally built on the northern edge of the city by the city walls on what was at the time Studsgade. It is one of the best examples of Neoclassical architecture in Aarhus and one of the last remaining brick built merchant's houses of that time. The building is in 4 wings with a courtyard in the middle but only the house facing the street is constructed in brick with the remaining being half-timbered structures with Baroque elements. The building was listed in 1919. In 1997 the architects firm Kjaer & Richter built an addition on an adjacent plot of land. It was designed in a modernistic style of concrete with glass facade. It is structured as a rectangular, black box with a dominating glass facade facing the street, intentionally contrasting the old building next to it. The design is modelled as a house-in- house with the auditorium appearing like an interior island that divides the building in an exhibition hall and foyer.

From the inauguration of his father in 1584 to the date of his own accession to the chiefship in 1639, the O'Donovan family had risen to become one of the most prominent Gaelic families remaining in all the province of South Munster or Desmond, from a position of semi-obscurity in the mid-16th century, although this was in part due to the misfortunes and sad decline of several once more prominent families, as happens in all ages. Donal II had also been an aggressive seizer of lands during and especially following the Nine Years' War and his son's inheritance, thought to have been approaching 100,000 acres (or possibly greater considering all septs and territories under his control), was colossal for a Gaelic family of the time. His father also living to a great age, Donal III is believed to have been in his late 50s or early 60s when he began his career as Lord of Clancahill. He died in 1660 at the age of 80 or greater. Dragon of Cl√≠odhna The great wandering Scottish poet Maol Domhnaigh √ì Muirgheas√°in (Muldony O'Morrison) refers to Donal III as the Dragon of Cl√≠odhna in a 1639 ode celebrating his accession to the chiefship of Clancahill.O'Donovan, Four Masters, vol. V, p. 1548, note This is edited and translated in its entirety, with notes, by Ronald Black in Scottish Gaelic Studies XIII, Part I, being the sole subject of the article. The poem discusses Donal's ancestry, virtues, regional fame, as well as the ancient lineage of his wife Gylles O'Shaughnessy and her qualities (selected stanzas below):Black, stanzas 5, 6, 27, 29, 30: Career O'Donovan, and a number of his kinsmen, joined the so-called Irish Rebellion of 1641 under Donagh MacCarthy,Hickson , pp. 379‚Äì80; Burke, p. 169; C., Justin MacCarthy, p. 161 along with the MacCarthy Reagh (Cormac) and the O'Sullivan Beare, and together they besieged Cork city for three weeks in 1642 with over four thousand men. But their force was opposed and defeated by the government supported Murrough O'Brien. Complaining of O'Donovan's other activities in 1642, the Reverend Urban Vigors writes:Vigors, p. 303 Later in the Irish Confederate Wars Donal III assisted his nextdoor neighbor James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven, who only lived two miles away across the harbour, in the taking of various fortifications in County Cork, notably Mallow, Doneraile, and the castles of Milton, Connagh, and Rostellan.O'Hart, p. 200 In 1648 he chose to visit Cork to accept the king's (offer of) peace from James Butler, the Marquess of Ormond, and at O'Donovan's death in 1660 his friends recounted his description of the event:√ì Murchadha, p. 130 O'Donovan also raised two companies of foot to be commanded by his younger brothers Morrogh and Rickard for the support of Charles II. Morrogh was commissioned a Captain by the Marquess of Ormond and placed in Colonel Henessy's regiment under the command of the Marquess himself in the Battle of Rathmines, where he was killed in action along with his entire company. Rickard was Captain in Colonel O'Driscoll's regiment, which had \\"retired beyond seas\\", where he also was \\"killed in his Majestie's service.\\" The eventual consequence of all the above was that O'Donovan's territories were laid waste by the forces of Oliver Cromwell in the late 1640s, who also blew up two of his castles with powder, all mentioned by MacCarthy in a 1660 certificate.O'Donovan, Four Masters, vol. VI, appendix, p. 2448 Estates Donal III was ultimately stripped of his estates by Cromwell in 1652. Only a very small portion, three thousand acres, of the tens of thousands of acres of his patrimony were eventually restored to his son and successor Donal IV. The infamously ungrateful Charles II of England, after first declaring they should be restored in their entirety, gave the rest away to Cromwell's soldiers in lieu of pay, O'Donovan not being a peer (although once he was landed as a number) and thus of little political consequence in this new British age. While not quite the estate of a great prince, much of the territory being rocky, Donal's rents were valued at ¬£2000 per annum, unadjusted for inflation, or adjusted coming to approximately ¬£3,650,000.00 (per annum) in 2009,MeasuringWorth.com, using \\"average earnings\\". See also Measures of Worth, Lawrence H. Officer and Samuel H. Williamson before the confiscations. This did not count the unpredictable profits from the harbours and bays from which he had dues, which depending on the circumstances could be as much as ten times the rents or greater per annum, the case for all lordships along the South Munster coast. However, most of this money was used for the local government of which the lord was head, and especially for maintaining security forces in the region, and so did not really belong to him or his family themselves to spend however they chose. Maintaining even a smallish army was expensive, the region being frequented by pirates,O'Donovan, passim; D'Alton (Bawnlahan papers) the great trade-off with such a maritime lordship. The threat was certainly real, proven by the nearby Sack of Baltimore in 1631. Marriage and issue Before 1639 he married Gyles (Sheela) O'Shaughnessy, at least twenty years his junior, the daughter of Elis Lynch and Sir Roger Gilla Duff O'Shaughnessy. Their issue were 1) Donal IV O'Donovan, and 2) Cornelius, 3) Morogh, and 4) Richard. It is probable he also at some point had a daughter Mary, who married Florence MacCarthy, younger son of the celebrated Prince Florence MacCarthy.O'Hart, p. 114; Hardiman, p. 419 They had issue Donogh or Denis, who also had issue, and so on, who are probably survived today. The last O'Donovan, Lord of Clancahill from the line of Donal III was Richard II O'Donovan (died 1829), after whom the chiefship passed to the cadet line, descendants of Donal III's younger brother Teige. Legends and reputation Of all the early modern Lords of Clancahill Donal III has the misfortune of having the worst popular reputation, for a single alleged act of appalling brutality, utter heartlessness and disregard for humanity which is still legendary in the countryside to this day: the hanging of Dorothy Forde, which damaged the local reputation of O'Donovan of Clancahill for centuries. As it is most often told, and as set forth in various depositions following the outrages on Protestants circa the 1640s, Dorothy had lent a sum of money to Donal, but when she later asked for it to be repaid he incomprehensibly hanged her, with the aid of his brother-in-law Teige-an-Duna MacCarthy, from the tower of Castle Donovan to eliminate her claim. Ford's family, who were Protestants, cursed O'Donovan and his direct line until they were extinct. The hanging was said to have caused a braon sinsir or \\"corroding drop,\\" said to be her tears, to drip from the castle until the last of O'Donovan's line were gone,.O'Donovan Rossa, passim (correspondence with John O'Donovan); √ì Murchadha, p. 129 The drip continues to this day, although O'Donovan's direct descendants in the male line died out in 1829.O'Donovan, passim Surveys of Ireland's haunted places regularly include the site and the story has become more elaborate as time has gone by, for example including the element of the O'Donovan family inviting Dorothy Forde to the castle to discuss the matter before seizing her.Jones, p. 113 The scholar Diarmuid √ì Murchadha considers the entire tradition to be \\"ill- founded\\", however, because a number of Protestant Carbery men of fine standing were present at Donal's death in 1660, and composed a testimonial to his excellence and good treatment of them during the conflicts,√ì Murchadha, pp. 129‚Äì30 with no mention made of Dorothy Forde or her family.O'Donovan, Four Masters, vol. IV, appendix, pp. 2447‚Äì50 Regardless of such 'testimonials\\", the testimonies in depositions following the outrages on Protestants clearly documented O'Donovan's involvement in the hanging, although the specifics involved a claim for barley, not a debt, and she was hung upon a tree, not from a castle.Deposition of Margrett Lyne, 18 September 1652, 1641 Depositions held by Trinity College Donal III also appears in the early-mid 19th century short story \\"Emma Cavendish\\" (author now unknown), as the host of the main character, an Englishman adventuring in Carbery, who refers to him as a decent man interested in the welfare of the English living there, making sure of their protection in his territories. However, O'Donovan's nephew, a person unknown to history, becomes a chief villain in the story eventually killed by the protagonist.\\"Emma Cavendish\\", passim Elegy Donal's elegy, after his death in 1660, was composed by Conchubhar Cam √ì D√°laigh. It was still extant in the mid 19th century but had not yet been printed. One for Gyles was also composed and may survive.

The term is also often applied to wastewater tariffs. Water and wastewater tariffs are not charged for water itself, but to recover the costs of water treatment, water storage, transporting it to customers, collecting and treating wastewater, as well as billing and collection. Prices paid for water itself are different from water tariffs. They exist in a few countries and are called water abstraction charges or fees. Abstraction charges are not covered in this article, but in the article on water pricing). Water tariffs vary widely in their structure and level between countries, cities and sometimes between user categories (residential, commercial, industrial or public buildings). The mechanisms to adjust tariffs also vary widely. Most water utilities in the world are publicly owned, but some are privately owned or managed (see water privatization). Utilities are network industries and natural monopolies. Economic theory predicts that unregulated private utilities set the price of their product at a level that allows to extract a monopoly profit. However, in reality tariffs charged by utilities are regulated. They can be set below costs, at the level of cost recovery without a return on capital, or at the level of cost recovery including a predetermined rate of return on capital. In many developing countries tariffs are set below the level of cost recovery, even without considering a rate of return on capital [ref]. This often leads to a lack of maintenance and requires significant subsidies for both investment and operation. In developed countries water and, to a lesser degree, wastewater tariffs, are typically set close to or at the level of cost recovery, sometimes including an allowance for profit[ref]. Criteria for tariff setting Water tariffs are set based on a number of formal criteria defined by law, as well as informal criteria.OECD:Pricing of Water Services, Paris 1987, p. 23-34 Formal criteria typically include: * financial criteria (cost recovery), * economic criteria (efficiency pricing based on marginal cost) and sometimes * environmental criteria (incentives for water conservation). Social and political considerations often are also important in setting tariffs. Tariff structure and levels are influenced in some cases by the desire to avoid an overly high burden for poor users. Political considerations in water pricing often lead to a delay in the approval of tariff increases in the run-up to elections.Ariel Dinar:The Political Economy of Water Pricing Reforms, World Bank, 2000 Another criterion for tariff setting is that water tariffs should be easy to understand for consumers. This is not always the case for the more complex types of tariffs, such as increasing-block tariffs and tariffs that differentiate between different categories of users.  Tariff structures  There are numerous different tariff structures. Their prevalence differs between countries, as shown by international tariff surveys.  Types of tariff structures  Water and wastewater tariffs include at least one of the following components: * a volumetric tariff, where water metering is applied, and * a flat rate, where no water metering is applied. Many utilities apply two-part tariffs where a volumetric tariff is combined with a fixed charge. The latter may include a minimum consumption or not. The level of the fixed charge often depends on the diameter of the connection. Volumetric tariffs can * be proportional to consumption (linear tariffs), * increase with consumption (increasing-block tariffs, IBT), or * decrease with consumption (decreasing- block tariffs, DBT). The tariff for a first block on an IBT is usually set at a very low tariff with the objective to protect poor households that are assumed to consume less water than non-poor households. The size of the first block can vary from 5 cubic meters to 50 cubic meters per household and month. In South Africa, the first block of consumption of 6 cubic meters per household and month is even provided for free (free basic water). Average monthly water consumption varies depending on household size and consumption habits between about 4 cubic meters for a single-person household in temperate climate (e.g. in Germany) with no outdoor water use and about 50 cubic meters for a four-person household in warm climate (e.g. in the Southern United States) including outdoor water use. However, there is not always a positive correlation between the level of household income and water consumptionCeline Nauges and Dale Whittington. Oct 2016. ‚ÄúEvaluating the Performance of Alternative Municipal Water Tariff Designs: Quantifying the Tradeoffs between Equity, Economic Efficiency, and Cost Recovery‚Äù World Development 91, 125‚Äì143, accessed on 21 November 2019 . Wastewater tariffs typically follow the same structure as water tariffs. They are typically measured based on the volume of water supplied, sometimes after subtracting an allowance made for estimated or actual outdoor use. In the case of industries, wastewater tariffs are sometimes differentiated based on the pollutant load of the wastewater. In some cases wastewater tariffs are a fixed percentage of water tariffs, but usually they are set separately. In addition to regular bills, many utilities levy a one-time connection fee both for water and for sewer connections.  International tariff surveys  The OECD conducted two surveys of residential water tariffs in 1999 and in 2007-08, using a reference consumption of 15 cubic meters per household and month. The 2007-08 survey covered more than 150 cities in all 30 OECD member countries. The survey does not claim to be representative. The OECD survey was complemented by a survey of the industry information service Global Water Intelligence (GWI) conducted in 2007-2008 in parallel with the second OECD survey. The 2008 GWI survey covered 184 utilities in OECD countries and 94 utilities in non-OECD countries.OECD:Managing Water for All:An OECD perspective on pricing and financing, Chapter 3:The Central Role of Tariffs, p. 73-94, 2009 GWI has repeated its survey every year from 2009 to 2012, increasing the number of utilities surveyed to 310 in 2012. The data from the OECD/GWI surveys are widely quoted and, unlike the results of other global tariff surveys, have been indirectly made available to the public. The database of the International Benchmarking Network (IB-Net) for Water and Sanitation Utilities includes tariff data from more than 190 countries and territories tariffs.ib- net.org. International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities:[www.ib-net.org], accessed on May 30, 2017, accessed on may 31, 2017 Another tariff survey has been conducted by the International Water Association.International Water Association:International Water Association Task Group on Tariffs and Financing, accessed on January 24, 2010 In addition, surveys of tariffs for commercial and industrial customers in selected OECD countries have also regularly been conducted by the consulting firm NUS.NUS Consulting, accessed on January 24, 2010  Prevalence of tariff structure types  Linear volumetric tariffs are the most common form of water tariffs in OECD countries, being used by 90 out of 184 utilities surveyed by Global Water Intelligence in 2007 and 2008, either with or without a fixed charge element. Some eastern European countries (Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic) use pricing systems based solely on volumetric pricing, with no fixed charge element at all.OECD:The Price of Water: Trends in OECD countries, 1999, accessed on January 21, 2010 Increasing-block tariff systems are used by 87 of the 184 utilities in OECD countries surveyed, such as e.g. in Spain. Since the late 1980s there has been a trend in OECD countries away from decreasing-block tariffs, which are apparently only still found in some cities of the United States. Where fixed charges exist as part of two-part tariffs, there is a shift toward the reduction or even abolition of large minimum free allowances in OECD countries. For example, Australia and South Korea have both moved in this direction during the 1990s. Flat rates are still reported in Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. Concerning developing countries and transition economies, in the non-representative GWI sample of 94 utilities in 54 countries, 59 used linear volumetric tariffs and 31 used increasing-block tariffs. However, utilities from Sub-Saharan Africa where increasing-block tariffs are very common are under-represented in the GWI sample with only 6 utilities. On the other hand, utilities from transition economies where linear volumetric tariffs are common are over-represented with 28 utilities. The survey thus probably underestimates the prevalence of increasing-block tariffs in non-OECD countries.  Tariff levels  There are different valid methods to compare water tariff levels. According to one method, the highest water and wastewater tariff in the world is found in Bermudas, equivalent to US$7.45 per m3 in 2017 (consumption of 15 m3 per month). The lowest water tariffs in the world are found in Turkmenistan and Cook Islands, where residential water is provided for free, followed by Uzbekistan with a water tariff equivalent to US$0.01 per m3 and no wastewater tariff  Difficulties related to tariff comparisons  There are two basic ways to calculate water and wastewater tariff levels for the purpose of comparing tariff levels between cities: One way is to calculate an average tariff for the utility. This is done by dividing total tariff revenues by the total consumption billed across all usage categories and all levels of consumption. Another way is to determine a typical level of consumption and calculate the residential tariff that corresponds to this consumption. Depending on which of these two methods is used the resulting tariff can vary significantly for the same utility. The comparison of water and wastewater tariffs across countries is further complicated by the choice of the appropriate exchange rate (nominal exchange rates for a given year or over the average of several years, or purchasing power parity exchange rates). Furthermore, providing a global overview of water tariff levels is complicated by the large number of service providers (utilities). In urban areas in the United States alone, there are more than 4,000 water utilities. In Germany there are more than 1,200 utilities. Few countries in the world maintain national databases of water and wastewater tariffs charged by utilities. There are few countries that maintain national tariff databases, usually those with a specialized regulatory agency for the water sector such as England (OFWAT), Chile (SISS), Colombia (CRA) or Peru (SUNASS).  Tariff levels  Among the 310 cities in the GWI 2012 tariff survey the average combined water and wastewater tariff was US$1.98/m3 for the 15 m3/month \\"benchmark\\" customer used by the survey. Utilities in four of the surveyed cities provide residential water and wastewater services for free: Dublin and Cork (see Ireland), as well as Belfast and Ashgabat in Turkmenistan. The lowest residential water and wastewater tariffs were found in Saudi Arabia (equivalent to US$0.03/m3) and in Havana, Cuba as well as Damsacus, Syria (equivalent to US$0.04/m3).Global Water Intelligence 2012 Water Tariff Survey, September 2012, Global Water Intelligence vol 13 issue 9 pp37-41 Rates in the United States in Clovis, CA are $0.42/m3.Clovis Hanford Water Rates Will Rise Soon and $1.60/m3 in Seattle Price Survey Table The highest water and wastewater tariffs were found in Aarhus, Denmark (US$9.21/m3), Essen, Germany (US$7.35/m3; not included in the OECD survey) Copenhagen, Denmark (US$7.09), and four Australian cities (Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney) where the tariff for the benchmark user ranged from US$6.38/m3 - US$6.47/m3. Concerning wastewater tariffs, in some countries such as [Nigeria] there is no wastewater tariff at all. In other countries - such as Mexico, Turkey, Belgium, Portugal and Korea - wastewater tariffs are low relative to water tariffs. Finally, in many OECD countries - such as in Australia, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US - wastewater tariffs are now higher than water tariffs, reflecting increasing cost recovery rates and an increase in the prevalence of wastewater treatment.OECD/Global Water Intelligence Water Tariff Survey 2007, quoted in:Peter Gleick, The World's Water 2008-2009, p. 321-323 Wastewater tariffs from 126 countries and territories can be found here https://tariffs.ib- net.org/sites/IBNET/VisualSearch/IndexCurrentUSD?Weight=0&ServiceId;=3&Yearid;=0 Many utilities charge higher tariffs for commercial and industrial customers than for residential users, in an effort to cross-subsidy residential customers.  Tariff adjustment processes  The process of adjusting water tariffs differs greatly from one location to another. In many large countries (China, France, Germany, India, Mexico, South Africa and the United States) the process of price adjustment takes place at the municipal level. Rules for price adjustments vary greatly. In the case of public service provision, tariffs are typically adjusted through a decision by the municipal council after a request by the municipal utility. Some countries, such as Germany, stipulate by law that all the financial costs of service provision must be recovered through tariff revenues. Other countries define cost recovery as a long-term objective, such as in Mexico. In the case of private service providers tariff adjustment rules are often laid out in concession or lease contracts, often providing for indexation to inflation. In some developing countries, water tariffs are set at the national level. Tariff increases are often considered a politically sensitive issue and have to be decided by the Cabinet of Ministers or a National Pricing Commission. This is the case in many countries of the Middle East and North Africa (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia), as well as in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, there are no objective criteria for tariff adjustments. Adjustments tend to be infrequent and often lag behind inflation so that cost recovery remains elusive. Some countries have created regulatory agencies at the national level that review requests for tariff adjustments submitted by service providers. The earliest and best-known example is the regulatory agency OFWAT, which was established for England and Wales in 1989. Some developing countries followed suit. They include Chile (1990), Colombia (1994), Honduras (2004), Kenya, Mozambique (1998), Peru (1994), Portugal (1997), and Zambia (2000). The review process is typically based on transparent and objective criteria set by law, in an attempt to move decision- making at least partly out of the realm of politics. The track record of these agencies has been diverse, usually mirroring the political and administrative traditions of each country.  Changes in water use in response to tariff increases  The responsiveness of demand to a change in price is measured by the price elasticity of demand, which is defined as the percentage change in demand divided by the percentage change in price. The price elasticity of drinking water demand by urban households is typically low. In European countries it ranges between -0.1 and -0.25, i.e. the demand for water decreases by 0.1% to 0.25% for every 1% increase in tariffs. In Australia and the United States price elasticity is somewhat higher in the range of -0.1 and -0.4.P. Herrington: Critical Review of Relevant Research Concerning the Effects of Charging and Collection Methods on Water Demand , Different Customer Groups and Debt, UK Water Industry Research, 2006  Affordability and social protection measures  In about half the OECD member countries, affordability of water charges for low-income households is or could become a significant issue, according to the OECD. In developing countries, the poor are often not connected to the network and often pay a higher share of their meager incomes for lower quantities of water supplied by water vendors through trucks. On the other hand, utility bills paid by those fortunate enough to be connected to the network are very low in some developing countries. Different countries have introduced a variety of approaches to protect the poor from high water tariffs.  Affordability  The affordability of water charges can be measured by macro- and micro-affordability.OECD:Social issues in the provision and pricing of water services, 2003, accessed on January 21, 2010 Macro-affordability\\" indicators relate national average household water and wastewater bills to average net disposable household income. In OECD countries it varies from 0.2% (Italy and Mexico) to 1.4% (Slovak Republic, Poland and Hungary). In the largest OECD countries the share is 0.3% in the United States and Japan, 0.7% in France and 0.9% in Germany. However, micro-affordability is quite different. It measures the share of bills in the income of the poor, defined in an OECD affordability study as the lowest decile of the population. This share varies between 1.1% (Sweden, Netherlands, Italy) and 5.3% in the Slovak Republic, 9.0% in Poland and 10.3% in Turkey. The OECD concludes that in half its member countries (15 out of 30), affordability of water charges for low-income households \\"is either a significant issue now or might become one in the future, if appropriate policy measures are not put in place.\\" In developing countries the situation is more serious, not only because of lower incomes, but also because the poor are often not connected to the network. They usually pay a higher share of their meager incomes for lower quantities of water at often lower quality supplied by water vendors through trucks. On the other hand, utility bills paid by those fortunate enough to be connected to the network are often relatively low, especially in South Asia. Because of this situation the OECD does not recommend to use uniform \\"thresholds\\" for the affordability of water and wastewater bills. These \\"thresholds\\" are often quoted in the range of 3-5% of household income.  Social protection measures  Social protection measures to ensure that piped water remains affordable can be broadly classified into income support measures and tariff- related measures. Income support measures address the individual customer‚Äôs ability to pay from the income side (through income assistance, water services vouchers, tariff rebates and discounts, bill re-phasing and easier payment plans, arrears forgiveness). An example of income assistance to poor users is the subsidy system applied in Chile. Tariff-related measures keep the size of water bills low for certain groups (e.g. refinement of increasing-block tariffs, tariff choice, tariff capping). Examples of increasing block tariffs with a price of zero in the first block are found in Flanders and South Africa. Another measure is the cross-subsidization using different tariffs for different neighborhoods, as practiced in Colombia. A similar approach has been used at the national level in Portugal. The Portuguese economic water regulator carried out an affordability study that found out that 10.5% of the population paid more than 3% of their income for water and wastewater services. As a result, the regulator showed flexibility concerning tariff increases and tariff solutions in municipalities where affordability was a particular issue.

These processes differ greatly under different circumstances.  Bottled water  Prices for bottled water are set in the market, but must be seen not as much as a price of water, than the price of the convenience, bottle and transportation. It is comparable to other bottled cheap beverages (soda, beer, ...). Retail prices vary widely between countries, brands, bottle sizes (0.33 liter to 20 liters) and place of sale (supermarket, fair, restaurant etc.). They range from US$ 0.05 to US$6 per liter, equivalent to US$ 50 to US$ 6,000 per cubic meter.  Tanker trucks  Prices for water sold by tanker trucks in bulk, which is common in cities of some developing countries for households without access to piped water supply, are set in the market. Prices for trucked water vary between about US$1 and US$6 per cubic meter.  Utility tariffs  Prices for piped water supply provided by utilities, be they publicly or privately managed, are determined administratively (see water tariffs). They vary from US$ 0.01 to almost US$ 8 per cubic meter (including sewer tariffs). Portland 2.17 gallons cost $0.01 http://www.portlandoregon.gov/water/29415  Irrigation  Prices for irrigation water that is being provided by a public agency are also typically determined administratively, usually using a flat rate, since metering is not common in agriculture in most countries of the world. The following pricing systems exist for irrigation: World Bank, by K. William Easter and Yang Liu:Cost Recovery and Water Pricing for Irrigation and Drainage Projects , Agriculture and Rural Development Discussion Paper 26, 2005, p. 15-19, accessed on February 7, 2010 * Area-based tariffs, sometimes differentiated by type of crop grown * Volumetric pricing, which requires measurement Tariffs can be paid in the form of labor, which holds mainly in communal types of management in traditional irrigation systems, or in cash. Tariffs can also vary between seasons, with higher tariffs charged during the dry season.  Direct abstraction  In most countries there is no charge for abstracting water directly from rivers, lakes and aquifers. However, some countries do levy volumetric charges or fees for water abstraction rights. These charges are typically levied on industries, utilities and farmers. Fees for water abstraction and discharge exist for example in France, where revenues are significant and are re-invested in the water sector by water agencies established in major basins. In Germany abstraction fees exist only for groundwater and only in some states, and their proceeds go into the general state budget. Mexico also charges for water abstraction and returns proceeds to utilities, but not to industries. Outside the OECD countries few countries charge water abstraction fees. Where they are applied the level of fees tends to be nominal, such as in Morocco, or enforcement is partial, such as for groundwater abstraction fees in Jordan. In almost all countries that have introduced abstraction fees agriculture, the major water user worldwide, is exempted from abstraction fees. Some countries allow water rights to be traded, so that the price for water itself is formed in the market. Such water trading exist in parts of Australia, Chile and the Southwestern United States).

The text's poetry is based on the principles of Advaita and Dvaita schools of Hindu philosophy.Katz, Jerry (2007). One: essential writings on nonduality. Sentient Publications. , . Source The text is attributed to Dattatreya, and extant manuscripts have been dated to approximately the 9th or 10th century. It consists of 289 shlokas (metered verses), divided into eight chapters. The first seven chapters are the text's oldest layer, and the eight chapter is likely a later interpolation. It may have been composed in the western states of India, probably Maharashtra. Avadhuta Gita has been one of the most important texts of the Natha Yogi tradition of Hinduism. Date Abhayananda states, \\"The actual date of authorship of the Avadhut Gita is unknown, but, judging by its terminology and style, it appears to have been written, not in the millennia prior to the Current Era, as legend would have it, but sometime around the 9th or 10th centuries of our Current Era. This does not, of course, preclude the possibility of an oral transmission to that point in time.\\"Swami Abhayananda (1992, 2007). Dattatreya: Song of the Avadhut: An English Translation of the 'Avadhuta Gita' (with Sanskrit Transliteration). Classics of mystical literature series. (paper), p.10 Name The title of the text, Avadhuta means \\"liberated soul\\", while Gita means song. The text describes the nature and the state of a person who is spiritually free and liberated. The text is also known as Avadhuta Grantha, Dattatreya Gita, Datta Gita Yoga Shastra and Vedanta Sara. Contents The Avadhuta Gita is structured in 8 chapters, wherein Dattatreya ‚Äì the symbol of the highest yogi and monastic life, describes as the divine master and example, the journey of self-realization, thereafter the nature and state of a person who lives in his soul's truth. Dattatreya asserts in the text, that the self-realized person is \\"by nature, the formless, all pervasive Self\\". He is in the state of sama-rasya or samata, which is where there are no differences between anything or anyone, neither one own's body or another person's, neither class nor gender, neither human being nor other living beings, between the abstract and the empirical universe, all is one interconnected reality, it is the unification of the One and the Beyond. His universe, all of the universe, is within his Atman (soul). \\"There is never any you and I\\", states verse 6.22. The chapters discuss 'contemplation', states Rigopoulos, as well as \\"sahaja am·πõitam\\" 'nectar of naturalness'. Some of its teachings have been compared to the Bhagavad Gita. The term Sahaja, that became important in both Hindu and Buddhist tantric traditions, means \\"transcendent Reality, or Absolute\\". It is equated to Sunya (void) in Buddhism, envisioned as a kind of \\"unlocated paradise\\", states Rigopoulos. In Hinduism, it is the interior Guru within the person, the Sadashiva, the all pervading ultimate Reality (Brahman) that is the Atman (soul) within. Translation The Brahmavadin journal published an English translation of the separate chapters of the Avadhuta Gita in Volumes 9 through 11, in early 20th century. The brief introduction with attendant English translation of the Avadhuta Gita by Ashokananda (1893‚Äì1969) is reproduced in Katz. Reception The text has been influential on the Nath tradition of Hinduism, states Rigopoulos, and its teachings form a foundation of their Sama-rasya doctrine: Passages of the text are found in numerous Hindu texts, such as in the widely translated Bhagavata Purana, which is the most popular Purana, where verses 8.2 to 8.4 of Avadhuta Gita appear as verses 11.11.29-11.11.31 as one example. The text's nirguni Brahman ideas influenced the poetry of Kabir, states Rigopoulos. Vivekananda (1863‚Äì1902) held the Avadhuta Gita in esteem and he translated aspects of it in the following talk he gave on July 28, 1895, transcribed by his disciple Waldo: > \\"He who has filled the universe, He who is Self in self, how shall I salute > Him!\\" To know the Atman as my nature is both knowledge and realisation. \\"I > am He, there is not the least doubt of it.\\" \\"No thought, no word, no deed, > creates a bondage for me. I am beyond the senses, I am knowledge and bliss.\\" > There is neither existence nor non-existence, all is Atman. Shake off all > ideas of relativity; shake off all superstitions; let caste and birth and > Devas and all else vanish. Why talk of being and becoming? Give up talking > of dualism and Advaitism! When were you two, that you talk of two or one? > The universe is this Holy One and He alone. Talk not of Yoga to make you > pure; you are pure by your very nature.

Latham Staples ESF About ESF He's the Chief Executive Officer of EXUSMED, Inc., a healthcare corporation based in La Jolla, California, and Chairman of the Empowering Spirits Foundation, Inc. (ESF), a national LGBT civil rights organization he founded in the United States.MyOutSpirit Early life and education Staples grew up in Fort Worth, Texas where he attended school at Fort Worth Academy, a private school his parents helped found. He spent his Summers in Albany, Texas, his grandparent's hometown, to perform annually in the Fort Griffin Fandangle, the oldest outdoor musical in the state of Texas. His undergraduate studies took Staples to Waco, Texas where he attended Baylor University, a Baptist-affiliated private university.SDGLN Contributors Staples graduated in 1999 as part of the first class of the Baylor Interdisciplinary Core, a division of the Honor's College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism and Political Science. It was at Baylor that Staples became heavily involved in public service. He served as assistant to Lester Gibson, McLennan County Precinct 2 Commissioner, and joined and served in various officer roles in Alpha Phi Omega (APO), a national service fraternity. Through APO Staples spent many of his weekends building homes for Habitat for Humanity or volunteering at a local children's learning center. Staples also coordinated with the American Red Cross the largest blood drive in central Texas' history. In addition, Staples was elected to Baylor Student Congress in various roles throughout his collegiate years, including Arts & Sciences Representative and Senior Class Representative. Corporate career In 2013 Staples became the Chief Executive Officer of EXUSMED, Inc. (EXUSMED), a healthcare corporation based in La Jolla, California. Prior to joining EXUSMED, Staples served as the President and CEO of Empowering Spirits Foundation, Inc. (ESF), a national non-profit organization he founded in 2008. Preceding ESF Staples was a corporate sales director for Dell, Inc. where he facilitated the creation and build-up of the business-to-business sales divisions at the corporation's then new Nashville, Tennessee and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma campuses. Staples previously served as Vice President of Public Relations and Marketing at Red Ridge Entertainment, Inc. and as a professional healthcare consultant with AMN Healthcare. Civil Rights Activity ESF volunteers build a new trail in the Gonzalez Canyon in San Diego, California. Staples created Empowering Spirits Foundation in 2008 in response to the LGBT community's response to the passage of Proposition 8. \\"The day after [the passage of Prop.8] various gay rights organizations attacked Christians, the Mormon Church and minority groups. In my mind this intolerance only amplified the hate, it didn't create change,\\" said Staples, in a feature article about ESF. Staples said he was laughed at when he suggested to one of the gay rights organizations that they should foster dialogue with those opposed to gay rights, instead of attacking them. Four days later Staples founded ESF, a pacifist LGBT civil rights organization. Instead of changing the laws, Staples strives to change the hearts and minds of the voters through ESF that are generally ignored by other existing LGBT organizations. ESF's programs are designed to encourage dialogue between the LGBT community and its non-LGBT neighbors while promoting open, non-disenfranchising communication. Staples' pacifist attitude, and desire to reach out to those with opposing viewpoints in order to influence change can be seen in a letter he penned regarding a race relations controversy while he attended Baylor in 1999. \\"In the past few weeks we have been bombarded with various news articles and editorials regarding the recent surge in tension concerning racial relations at Baylor. Much of this has focused on punishing the NoZe brotherhood and criticizing the administration for its seeming lack of response to the situation. As a participant of last week's Racial Legacies Dialogue on Race, and a member of student congress, I can firmly say that the administration is very much concerned about this problem and addressing the issues and finding solutions to the problems at hand. Adrian Despres, speaker at last week's Resurrection Week services, stressed that we tend to focus on the differences and problems of others. However, he continued to say that real change must begin within ourselves. I believe that we as a community are all at fault for the recent strain. The problem isn't just with others of a different race but with differences in people as a whole. We, myself included, tend to associate with those that we are most comfortable with, mainly due to our upbringing; whether it is those of the same economic status, race, religious beliefs, etc. However, we must step beyond these boundaries. It is only through interaction with others, whether it is through dialogue, mixers, sporting activities or other various forms, that we can truly understand each other. Each of us must take a step.\\" Echoing Green Echoing Green, an angel investor in social entrepreneurial organizations, named Staples a 2010 Fellow June 22, 2010, and committed to funding ESF for two years. Staples was the only grantee selected from the category of \\"Civil & Human Rights.\\" ‚ÄúWe found both the mission and the approach of Mr. Staples and his organization to be refreshing and timely,‚Äù said Cheryl L. Dorsey, Echoing Green President. ‚ÄúIt takes courage and grace to work alongside someone who fundamentally disagrees with you. Through ESF‚Äôs community service programs they are engaging in work everyone can agree on and be passionate about. Mr. Staples and his organization are creating a common ground, a new tool in creating social justice.‚Äù Community Involvement Staples also currently serves on several large non-profit nationally based governing boards, including as Secretary to the Board of Directors of the Department of Defense Federal Globe, and on the Board of Directors of the National Women Veterans Association of America. He also served on Lori Saldana's, former member of the California State Assembly from the 76th Assembly district, Hate Free San Diego Commission as he consulted with representatives of San Diego businesses to foster programs to end hate crimes. He's also a voting member of the San Diego LGBT Center's Community Leadership Council, and he serves on the Public Policy Advisory Committee. Political Involvement Staples has worked on several political campaigns, including those of former Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, San Diego Schoolboard Vice-President Kevin Beiser, and former Congressman and former San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, and he served as political adviser to California 50th district Democratic candidate Tracy Emblem. Staples also currently serves on the San Diego LGBT Community Center Public Policy Action Committee and the Center for Leadership Committee. References External links *A.

Located in a limestone tower karst region of the Annamite Range in Khammouane Province, it is home to a number of rare or newly discovered species. National Biodiversity Conservation Areas are not protected by the government of Laos in any meaningful way; the budget for each is about $500. The human population of the NBCA is 29,603. Flora and fauna The vegetation of Phou Hin Poun National Biodiversity Conservation Area is shaped by its tropical savanna climate, and the rugged, cave-riddled and porous karst terrain. Over 50% of the landscape is estimated to be rocky outcroppings, and most of the rest is dry evergreen forest and scrubland. This diverse landscape is home to 113 species of mammal, 160 species of bird, 81 species of reptile, 47 species of amphibian and 145 species of fish. There are 41 known species of bats in Phou Hin Poun National Biodiversity Conservation Area, with a single cave, Tam Houay Si, used by 22 species. The most striking discovery coming from the Phou Hin Poun NBCA is the Laotian rock rat (Laonastes aenigmamus), so unusual that it was first assigned to its own family and later to a family previously thought to be extinct for 11 million years. Another species discovered in the Phou Hin Poun NBCA, Saxatilomys paulinae, represents a new genus of the Murinae subfamily, the Old World rats and mice. Mammals known or suspected to live in Phou Hin Poun include the Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus), the Indochinese tiger (Panthera tigris corbetti), the critically endangered saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), the giant muntjac (Muntiacus vuquangensis), the Assam macaque (Macaca assamensis), Fran√ßois' langur (Semnopithecus francoisi laotum), and the black giant squirrel (Ratufa bicolor).

Transit services being provided by PRT in Idaho Transportation District #5 have been greatly assisted by County and Municipal organizations, Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Residents & visitors within the service area are all eligible to ride and the welcome is extended to come & \\"TAKE YOUR SEAT\\" on the bus. History Privately operated rubber tired motorized Streetcar service was operated in the Pocatello area at least as early as World War I (Circa 1917), with that type of conveyance plying the streets between the city's downtown and The Academy (Now Idaho State University) and other locations. These early beginnings of public transit in Pocatello expanded to significant private public bus service in succeeding decades with the costs of capitalization and operations being met through inexpensive fares. Private automobile ownership was not what it is today and the bus services thrived. However, by the mid 1960s this situation began to change with most privately owned intra-city public bus services in the United States no longer financially sustainable. Pocatello's privately owned bus services pretty much went out of service before 1965 and there would be a period of some fifteen years before any regularly scheduled fixed-route public transit system would be seen on the streets of Pocatello. Pocatello Regional Transit (PRT), as it is known today, originated with the South Eastern Idaho Community Action Agency's (SEICAA) creation of a targeted and limited door-to-door service for senior citizens in 1972. This one bus system, using an old surplus army vehicle, was known as Tello Bus. Throughout the 70's the service capability and area expanded to include senior bus service in Pocatello and some areas of Bannock County. Title IIIB, state senior citizen transportation funding along with Bannock County, City of Pocatello and SEICAA financial assistance represented the operational and capital foundation until 1978. This was also the year that the system was able to extend service to include persons with disabilities regardless of age. Tello Bus became Urban Transit in 1980 (subsequently called Pocatello Urban Transit‚ÄîPUT) with a loop opposed loop fixed route service for the general public added to its door-to-door services for seniors and persons with disabilities. In 1982, in an action responding to the 1980 census which made Pocatello a small urbanized area, the City of Pocatello assumed responsibility for the administration and operations of the transit system. Also in the late 1970s and early 1980s, UMTA (Urban Mass Transportation Administration, later called FTA‚ÄîFederal Transit Administration.) began to provide some funding assistance for rural public transit. This policy change greatly assisted the local transit system in making it possible to serve the broader general public needs in Pocatello and the rural areas. After 1982, when Pocatello became a small urban area, the funding assistance was separated for the small urban area and the rural areas of service. Pocatello Urban Transit (PUT) underwent a final name change in the late 1980s to the system name of Pocatello Regional Transit (PRT); reflecting its return to rural service, expanded urban fixed route service, and the inclusion of routes wholly serving the Idaho State University campus. Even though It was always a financial challenge for PRT to survive and flourish without any dedicated state funding to assist the City and rural areas in the provision of public transit, the system continued to grow while carefully husbanding limited resources. This included the use of used vehicles for the fixed route until the first new buses were bought with Stripper Well funds match and UMTA funds in 1988. Thereafter, buses were able to be purchased including the acquisition of new 30' and 35' buses for fixed route service. Today, PRT operates 33 buses throughout the service area, consisting of 10 fixed-route buses, 7 demand-responsive vehicles in Pocatello-Chubbuck and 16 small buses in rural service. All routed buses and vehicles serving persons with disabilities have ADA accessible lift/ramp and features. Acquiring and maintaining administrative and maintenance facilities has historically presented a challenge as well. The old Greyhound Building was used for many years as a transit downtown transfer and administrative facility as well as a (circa 1920's) garage on the East side that PRT shared with other city departments for a number of years‚Äîit has long since seen its best years. In an exciting development, thanks to FTA and the City of Pocatello, a project some six years in the making is about to come to fruition with the opening in July 2014 of new transit Administration and Maintenance facilities on South 5th. Fixed Routes (Pocatello) PRT offers multiple fixed route services throughout the cities of Pocatello/Chubbuck available to ALL general public. All routed buses include ADA features including accessible wheelchair lifts/ramps. These services are provided on a repetitive, fixed schedule basis along a specific route with vehicles stopping to pickup and deliver passengers to specific locations; each fixed route trip serves the same origins and destinations once an hour. Buses ONLY stop at designated stops (city ordinance). Free transfer tickets are available for passengers needing to access destinations that otherwise requires more than one bus route and must be requested at the time the fare is paid upon boarding. PRT Commuter Bus Commuter Routes PRT's commuter routes operate on a faster schedule by not making as many stops as normal bus services and often taking quicker routes, such as along freeways. The fare on the commuter services vary and may be higher than normal parallel services, for the quicker service. PRT's current commuter routes consist of: *Aberbeen Commuter (Pocatello to Aberdeen via American Falls) *Blackfoot Commuter (Pocatello to Blackfoot) *Logan Commuter (Preston to Logan, UT) Paratransit Services PRT Paratransit Bus PRT offers paratransit (door-to-door) services which is available to senior citizens 60+ years of age and also qualifying disabled passengers that are unable to, either temporarily or permanently, utilize the other transportation services provided by PRT. All buses include ADA features including accessible wheelchair lifts/ramps.

Description Eucalyptus campanulata is a tree that grows to a height of , sometimes and has rough, finely fibrous, greyish brown bark on the trunk and main branches, smooth whitish bark on the thinner branches. The leaves on young plants are lance-shaped to egg-shaped or curved, long, wide and bluish or greyish green. The adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are the same bluish green on both surfaces. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between eleven and fifteen on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are club-shaped, long and wide with an operculum as wide as, but shorter than the floral cup. Flowering occurs from October to December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a bell-shaped or conical capsule, long and wide on a pedicel long. This species is distinguished from E. andrewsii by the shape of the fruit, being bell-shaped rather than cup-shaped. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus campanulata was first formally described in 1912 by Richard Baker and Henry Smith who published the description in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales.

Although the film features one of the most remarkable Bulgarian actors, the biting satire of nonsensical activity made the authority keep the film away from the widespread presentation during the totalitarian system in Bulgaria. In the 1990s, after the advent of democracy, the film came into broad view and became an eminent badge for the Bulgarian Film Art from those years. Plot Itzhak Fintzi and Filip Trifonov, The Hare Census (1973) The daily routine in the village of Yugla is shaken by the statistician clerk Asenov (Fintzi) who come with a mission to take the census of the hares in the locality. He makes the village mayor Bay Georgi (Todev) mobilize the local men in realization of the absurd task. On the very day all the village men are in the field. The mayor, the teacher, the veterinarian... even an old man joins the group. Naturally all the efforts failed in fulfilling the mission since not a single hare came into sight. The undertaking ends with an open area banquet, with a grape brandy, and wine under a tree.

Raja rejects the proposal and with Kundu he sets out to find a suitable bridegroom for Ammadu. In a distant village, Raja and Kundu meet Dhoopati Viyyanna, a zamindar and the president of the panchayat. Viyyanna is a complex character of declining fortunes and generous spirit who believes in respecting his guests. Raju and Viyyanna's daughter Savitri fall in love and their wedding is quickly arranged. Viyyanna also finds a bridegroom named Venkata Ramana, a pleader living in Madras, for Ammadu. Ramana's father, Venkatapathy, demands a large dowry, which Viyyanna promises to pay. At the marriage venue, Govindayya plots revenge by inciting Venkatapathy to insist on the dowry being paid before the marriage. Viyyanna issues a promisory note; Venkatapathy rejects it and drags Ramana from the marriage hall. However, Ramana leaves for Madras and lives there with Ammadu. When Venkatapathy arrives, Ramana feigns mental illness while Ammadu and Raja pretend to be a nurse and a doctor. Ammadu endears herself to Venkatapathy by showing interest in his recitals of the puranas. Ramana 'recovers' from the mental illness and Ammadu, who has been pregnant, gives birth to their son, causing a fresh round of gossip in the village. Govindayya tries to take advantage of this and after numerous failed attempts, he persuades Venkatapathy to conduct Ramana's marriage with Chitti. Viyyanna considers this to be an insult and conducts the marriage of Chitti and Bheemudu at his residence. Govindayya and his wife Chukkalamma refuse to acknowledge the marriage. When Venkatapathy asks Ramana to marry Chitti, he refuses and foregoes the wealth he is entitled to inherit in exchange for Ammadu and their newborn son. Govindayya asks Venkatapathy to marry Chitti and Chukkalamma protests, reuniting Chitti and Bheemudu. A helpless Govindayya is confronted by Viyyanna, who threatens to use his influence as a president of the panchayat to have him arrested if he does not reform himself. Govindayya begs pardon and flees with his family. The film ends with everyone present in Ramana's house, laughing maniacally.  Cast  *N. T. Rama Rao as Venkata Ramana *G.

V. Prasad in a cameo appearance *B. Venkatarami Reddy in a cameo appearance  Production  When differences arose between Aluri Chakrapani and G. Varalakshmi, the former wanted to scrap the near-complete film and replace her with Anjali Devi (pictured). Devi however mediated between them and solved the differences. After producing Shavukaru (1950) and Pathala Bhairavi (1951), B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani announced a film titled Pelli Chesi Choodu, which would be directed by L. V. Prasad and financed by their company Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Pelli Chesi Choodu was made as a bilingual film; it was shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil, with the Tamil version titled Kalyanam Panni Paar, the first Tamil film directed by Prasad. Chakrapani wrote the film's script, which was based on the negative effects of the dowry system in India. Marcus Bartley was recruited as the cinematographer and the film was edited by C. P. Jambulingam and M. S. Money. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors, and the music score was composed by Ghantasala. Chalapathi Rao and Jagannadham were the production executives. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy choreographed the song sequences. T. Prakash Rao worked as an assistant director under Prasad; Rao directed Palletooru (1952) during the post-production phase of Pelli Chesi Choodu. Kalyanam Panni Paar was partly colourised using Gevacolor. N. T. Rama Rao and G. Varalakshmi were chosen as one of the leading pairs of actors. During the songs' shoot, Ghantasala taught Rama Rao to play the harmonium and gave him a few music lessons so he would look believable in the film. Yandamuri Jogarao and Savitri, who had played minor roles in Shavukar and Pathala Bhairavi, were chosen as the other leading pair. In playing the role of the zamindar, S. V. Ranga Rao exhibited a strange body language, inspired by a stranger he had observed at a railway station. Dr. Sivarama Krishnayya and C.V.V. Panthulu played the role of Rama Rao's father in the Telugu and Tamil versions. Padmanabham played two roles; a postman and Ranga Rao's friend. The child artists in the film were members of Nyapathi Raghavarao's 'Balanandam' troupe. They were trained by Gnapadi Kameswara Rao, whose nephew Gade Balakrishna \\"Kundu\\" Rao played a key role in the film's Telugu and Tamil versions. Vijaya Vauhini Studios hired actors on a monthly salaried basis for this film; one of these was M. Mallikarjuna Rao, who later directed films Prameelarjuneeyam (1965), Muhurtha Balam (1969), and Gudachari 116 (1976). Differences between Chakrapani and Varalakshmi occurred during the last stage of principal photography. Chakrapani wanted to replace Varalakshmi with Anjali Devi and reshoot the entire film. However, Devi mediated between them and resolved the differences. Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi due to the latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi refused to touch Rama Rao's feet in the scene in which his father drags him from the marriage hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad‚Äîthe second assistant cameraman working under Bartley‚Äîto wear a dhoti and stand before her. Chakrapani liked a scene in a play in which a group of police officers in ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by children into the film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film. Mohan Kanda, who later became the Chief Secretary of Andhra Pradesh before its bifurcation, also appeared in the film as a child artist.  Music  The official soundtracks of Pelli Chesi Choodu and Kalyanam Panni Paar were composed by Ghantasala. The sound mixing process was supervised by A. Krishnan and Siva Ram. The soundtrack was processed by N. C. Sen Gupta and was orchestrated by Master Venu. This was Ghantasala's third film as a music director under his five-film contract with Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Utkuri Satyanarayana wrote the lyrics for \\"Amma Noppule\\" and \\"Brahmayya O Brahmayya\\", while Pingali Nagendrarao wrote the lyrics for the other fifteen songs. Four of the songs featured the child artists. The song \\"Ezhumalai Andavaney\\", sung by P. Leela for Kalyanam Panni Paar, is based on the carnatic raga known as Chakravakam. The song \\"Pelli Chesukoni\\" was composed using the Kalyani raga. Ghantasala recorded the songs \\"Manasa Nenevaro Neeku Thelusa\\" and \\"Yedukondalavada Venkataramana\\" first with Jikki. He was not satisfied and recorded them again with P. Leela; the soundtrack's gramophone records featured both versions. The soundtrack was released in December 1952 under the Saregama music label. It was a critical and commercial success, Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema, termed the songs \\"Amma Nopule\\" and \\"Pelli Chesukoni\\" as \\"especially popular\\".  Release, reception and legacy  Pelli Chesi Choodu had its theatrical release on 29 February 1952, and Kalyanam Panni Paar on 15 August 1952. Both versions were released with a final reel length of and were given a \\"U\\" (Universal) certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification with a run time of 156 minutes. Both versions were commercially successful; the Telugu version completing a 100-day run in 11 centres, and the Tamil version completed a 100-day run in many centres. The Telugu version completed a 182-day run at Durga Kala Mandiram, Vijayawada, where celebrations marking the film's success were held. Rama Rao and Varalakshmi did not attend the event because of the differences between them. Reviewing the film, M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu called Pelli Chesi Choodu a \\"text-book for filmmakers\\" on \\"how to make a clean and wholesome entertainer on a burning issue without resorting to slogan-mongering, and yet driving home the point in a subtle manner\\". Narasimham also said the actors \\"deserved full marks for excellent performance\\" in the film. In his book Alanati Chalana Chitram, K. N. T. Sastry wrote that Pelli Chesi Choodu is an ensemble comedy that \\"abounds in intrigues and disguises gearing to the making and breaking of marriage alliances\\". According to the film historian Randor Guy, Pelli Chesi Choodu was the first in a series of satirical comedies directed by Prasad and produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Guy said the film's box office performance made Prasad famous in both Telugu and Tamil cinema. After Pelli Chesi Choodu, Prasad and Vijaya Vauhini Studios collaborated on Missamma (1955) and Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1959). All three films were profitable ventures and achieved cult status in Telugu cinema. Pelli Chesi Choodu is considered as one of the acclaimed films in the careers of Prasad and Varalakshmi. Relangi Narasimha Rao's 1988 Telugu film, which was also about the negative effects of dowry system in India, was titled Pelli Chesi Choodu. Pelli Chesi Choodu was also used as the title of a 2014 theatrical play staged by Sri Sai Arts, which won a Nandi Award.  Remakes and colourisation plans  Vijaya Vauhini Studios remade the film in Kannada as Maduve Madi Nodu (1965). It was directed by Hunsur Krishnamurthy and features Rajkumar and Leelavathi in the lead roles. Maduve Madi Nodu was a profitable venture. Prasad remade the film in Hindi as Shaadi Ke Baad (1972), in which Jeetendra, Rakhee and Shatrughan Sinha reprised the roles played by Rama Rao, Varalakshmi and Ranga Rao in the original. Shaadi Ke Baad underperformed at the box office. In late November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies acquired the film negative rights to 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Pelli Chesi Choodu, to release digitally re-mastered versions in colour. The remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar was released in January 2010 and performed well in theatres, but Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films, including Pelli Chesi Choodu; the company said most of the producers who sold the rights of the negatives to television channels lost control over them. Goldstone added that there were many legal issues over ownership and copyright whenever other producers tried to do something on their own.

Established in 1886, Mitford supported a sawmill, and later a coal mine, before being abandoned by 1898.  History  In 1885, T.B.H. Cochrane and his wife, Adela, exchanged their lease of near High River for one just west of present-day Cochrane, Alberta. The next year, Cochrane associated himself with the Calgary Lumber Company and built a sawmill three miles west of present-day Cochrane, handling the vast amount of lumber on his lease. Although the Canadian Pacific Railway approached the mill from the east, tension built between Cochrane and the railway, as the railway did not like stopping at the mill due to the steep grades nearby. By 1888 the town contained an office, drug store and bunkhouses. By 1891 it had a school as well, meeting in the saloon. It was named for a friend of Cochrane's wife. However, the success of the sawmill was limited. Most of the good quality fir to be found in the area was never sold, instead ironically being used to construct a railway designed to transport the lumber to market. In 1888, a coal mine began operation in the area, with the distinct advantage of having the sawmill's railway nearby to transport the coal to market. In 1890, it became obvious that both operations were doomed to fail, closing the same year. In an effort to save the town, T.B.H. Cochrane established a brickyard using material found just north of Mitford. In 1893, that operation was also closed, due to the inferior quality of its product. After the closing of the brickyard, the town fell into decline, before it was abandoned in 1898. Before its desertion, Mitford housed a store, a school, a hotel, a restaurant, a medical practice, and an Anglican church. The steam engine used on Mitford's railway was sold to a British Columbia mill, and the Canadian Pacific Railway ceased making regular stops at the town.  Today  In 1898 a fire started in the Chinese restaurant, destroying most of the town. In 1899, the town's church was moved to Cochrane, and today all that remains is the town's cemetery, which currently stands on private property.

Allen was an orthodox Quaker and his business was in textiles but his interests were in reform, temperance and the abolition of slavery. He married Ann Webb in 1828. In 1837, Allen was one of three founding members, with James Haughton and Richard Davis Webb, of the Hibernian Antislavery Association. This was not the first antislavery association but it was acknowledged to be the most active. Allen served as the secretary of this association.

Biography Thienemann was born in Gangloffs√∂mmern, in the Prussian Province of Saxony. His father August Wilhelm and his grandfather Georg August Wilhelm were both clergymen with an interest in ornithology. The grandfather collaborated with Christian Ludwig Brehm. Thienemann followed the family tradition and his early training was for joining the Christian ministry. He later worked as a teacher but found his vocation in ornithology, in particular the study of bird migration. In 1901 he founded the bird observatory on the Curonian Spit at Rossitten, East Prussia (now Rybachy, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). The location had been of interest from the late 1880s, when ornithologists took an interest in the birds migrating through the region. Thienemann first visited the area in July 1896. Kurt Fl√∂ricke, a trader in bird specimens had set up a local society of bird enthusiasts (Verein vergn√ºgter Vogelfreunde) in 1890. Fl√∂ricke however moved out of the area separating from his wife who then married Thienemann. Fl√∂ricke was to become a fierce critic of the scientific work of Thienemann. Among Thienemann's attempts was to introduce artificial nest boxes to induce hole- nesting birds to take up residence. He also provided sparrow carcasses for tits to feed on in winter and attempted the use artificial floating nest islands for gulls and encouraged the control of foxes and other predators. In 1899 he learnt of the bird ringing project started by Hans Mortensen in Denmark and began ringing and colour marking birds. Some of his early experiments were on ringing crows since they tended to be shot by hunters and traditional \\"crow-catchers\\" who then reported the rings. Thienemann was criticized by Hermann L√∂ns. Thienemann distributed rings to others in the region including wealthy land holders, zoologists and hunters, building up a large network of bird ringers. Thienemann gave talks around the region and collated ring recoveries in annual reports. Thienemann was also interested in bird flight, and conducted experiments on the altitude at which birds flew in collaboration with the balloonist Friedrich von Lucanus and the gliding pioneer, Ferdinand Schulz. After 1926 Thienemann reared young storks and released them with announcements on the local radio about them leading to widespread interest in birds and their migration. In 1910 he published on the patterns of their migration based on 35 storks. Thienemann was largely self taught but received a degree in zoology at the age of 45 and was appointed a professor at the University of K√∂nigsberg but he took little interest in traditional academics. Thienemann worked with formally trained ornithologists including Oskar Heinroth who served for a while as the official director of the observatory. Thienemann carried out his ornithological work for the rest of his life, though retiring as director of the observatory in 1929. He died at Rossitten in his 75th year.

The traditional ritual music for the service of Lord Jagannatha, Odissi music has a history spanning over two thousand years, authentic sangita-shastras or treatises, unique Ragas & Talas and a distinctive style of rendition. The various aspects of Odissi music include : chaupadi, chhƒÅnda, champu, chautisa, janƒÅna, mƒÅlasri, bhajana, sarimƒÅna, jhulƒÅ, kuduka, koili, poi, boli and more. Presentation dynamics are roughly classified into four : raganga, bhabanga, natyanga and dhrubapadanga. Some great composer-poets of the Odissi tradition are the 12th-century poet Jayadeva, Balarama Dasa, Atibadi Jagannatha Dasa, Dinakrusna Dasa, Kabi Samrata Upendra Bhanja, Banamali Dasa, Kabisurjya Baladeba Ratha and Kabikalahansa Gopalakrusna Pattanayaka. According to Bharata Muni's Natyashastra, Indian classical music has four significant branches: Avanti, Panchali, Odramagadhi and Dakshinatya. Of these, Odramagadhi exists in the form of Odissi music. Odissi music crystallised as an independent style during the time of Odia poet Jayadeva, who composed lyrics meant to be sung, set to ragas and talas unique to the local tradition. However, Odissi songs were written even before the Odia language developed. Odissi music has a rich legacy dating back to the 2nd century BCE, when king Kharavela, the ruler of Odisha (Kalinga), patronized this music and dance. The traditional artforms of Odisha such as Mahari, Gotipua, Prahallada Nataka, Radha Prema Lila, Pala, Dasakathia, Bharata Lila, Khanjani Bhajana, etc. are all strongly based on Odissi music. Odissi is one of the classical dances of India from the state of Odisha; it is performed with Odissi music.  History  Odissi music is intimately and inextricably associated with the Jagannatha temple of Puri. The deity of Jagannatha is at the heart of Odisha's culture, and Odissi music was originally the music offered as a sevƒÅ or service to Jagannatha. Every night during the Badasinghara or the last ritual of the deity, the Gitagovinda of Jayadeva is sung, set to traditional Odissi ragas & talas. This tradition has continued unbroken since the time of Jayadeva, who himself used to sing in the temple. After the time of the poet, the singing of the Gitagovinda according to the authentic Odissi ragas & talas was instated as a mandatory sevƒÅ at the temple, to be performed by the Maharis or Devadasis, systematically recorded in inscriptions, the MƒÅdalƒÅ PƒÅnji and other official documents that describe the functioning of the temple. To this date, the Jagannatha temple remains the fountainhead of Odissi music and the most ancient & authentic compositions (including a few archaic Odia chhandas and jananas by Jayadeva himself) survive in the temple tradition, although the Devadasis are no more found owing to their systematic eradication by the British government.  Prehistoric music  Ancient Odisha had a rich culture of music, which is substantiated by many archaeological excavation throughout Odisha. At Sankarjang in the Angul district, the initial spade work exposed the cultural stratum of the Chalcolithic period (400 BC onward). From here, polished stone celts and hand-made pottery have been excavated. Some of the Celts are narrow but large in size. Thus they are described as Bar-celts. On the basis of bar- celts discovered in Sankarjung it could be argued that they were an earlier musical instrument in India.  Sculptural evidence  There is historical evidence in the form of sculptural evidence, i.e. musical instruments, singing and dancing postures of damsels in the Ranigumpha Caves in Khandagiri and Udayagiri at Bhubaneswar. These caves were built during the reign of the Jain ruler Kharabela in the 2nd century BC. Further in the temples of Odisha of 7th and 13th century AD such as Parasuramesvara, Muktesvara, Lingaraja and Konarka, there are hundreds of sculptures depicting musical performances and dancing postures. The Natya Shastra mentions four unique pravrttis or regional schools of artistic excellence. Among these is mentioned the Udramagadhi. Parts of ancient Kalinga, Kangoda, Dakhina Kosala, Tosali, Matsya Desa, Udra now constitute the state of Odisha. The classical music that prevailed in these regions was known as Udramagadhi paddhati. The post-Jayadeva text Sangita Ratnakara also makes a reference to the same. In the present times, it is this very system that goes under the rubric Odissi music.  Kharabela  The caves of Khandagiri and Udayagiri were carved during the period of the Jain emperor Kharabela of Kalinga. In historical records, Kharabela has been described as an expert in music and a great patron of music. The same is reflected in the sculptures found in the caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri, replete with people dancing to musical accompaniments. Madanlal Vyas describes him as an expert who had organized a music programme where sixty four instruments were played in tandem. Kharabela was an emperor of the Chedi dynasty. Chedi was the son of Kausika, a Raga that is said to have been created by sage Kasyapa according to Naradiya Sikhya. The ancient musicologists of Odisha, like Harichandana belonged to the Naradiya school. The Raga Kausika is an extremely popular raga in the Odissi tradition, even till date.  Evolution   Charyapada and Buddhist Music  For a long period Buddhism was the major religion of Odisha. The Vajrayana and Sahajayana branches of Buddhism were particularly influential, and scholars opine that Odisha or Oddiyana was the birth place of Vajrayana itself. Between the seventh and eleventh century AD, the Charya Gitika of Buddhist Mahasiddhas or Siddhacharyas were written and composed. Many of the Mahasiddhas were born in Odisha and wrote in a language that is extremely close to present-day Odia. The ragas used by them have been found in Odia literature for centuries afterwards, and remain important to this date. Some of these songs were ritually sung on top of the ratha of Jagannatha during the Ratha Jatra.  Jayadeva and Gita Govinda  Even Mahari tradition and singing of Geeta- Govinda in the temple of Lord Jagannatha since the time of King Prataparudra Deva in the 15th century proves the rich tradition of Odissi.  Gopala Nayaka  During the reign of Alauddin Khilji, Gopala Nayaka had an important role of popularising old Indian music. Some scholars from Odisha in the first part of the 20th century have written about local legend that states Gopala Nayaka was from Odisha. After the reign of Mukunda Deba in the 16th century, Odissi music suffered during the Maratha rule in Odisha during the 17th and 18th century AD.  British rule  During the 18th and 19th centuries, Odissi music was chiefly patronised by local kings of princely states of Odisha. This included the Gajapati of Puri as well as the rulers of the kingdoms of Paralakhemundi, Mayurbhanj, Ghumusara, Athagada, Athagada Patana, Digapahandi (Badakhemundi), Khallikote, Sanakhemundi, Chikiti, Surangi, Jeypore, Ali, Kanika, Dhenkanal, Banapur, Sonepur, Baramba, Nilgiri, Nayagarh, Tigiria, Baudh, Daspalla, Bamanda (Bamra), Narasinghapur, Athamallik as well as places with a significant Odia population and cultural history such as Tarala (Tharlakota), Jalantara (Jalantrakota), Manjusa (Mandasa), Tikili (Tekkali) and Sadheikala (Seraikela). Rulers often patroised poet-composers and skilled musicians, vocalists and instrumentalists. Musicians were appointed in royal courts and honoured with land or other rewards. Many kings were themselves skilled musicians and poets, such as Gajapati Kapilendra Deba of Puri or Biswambhara Rajendradeba of Chikiti.  Treatises  Several dozens of treatises on music written in Odisha have been found. It is known that at least from the 14th century onwards, there was a continuous tradition of musicology in the state. Many of the texts have been critically edited and published by the Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi and the Department of Culture, Odisha. Of these, the core texts of Odissi music are : *Gita Govinda of Jayadeva (12th century) *Sangita Sara of Hari Nayaka (14th century) *Gitaprakasa of Krusnadasa Badajena Mahapatra (15th century) *Sangita Narayana of Gajapati Narayanadeba, Purusottama Misra (17th century) *Sangitarnava Chandrika of Nilakantha *Sangita Muktabali of Harichandana *Natya Manorama of Raghunatha Ratha *Sangita Kamoda of Gopinatha Patra *Kalankura Nibandha of Kalankura Muni *Sangita Sadananda of Sadananda Kabisurjya Brahma *Sangitasara Boli of Bandhu Binakara *Gitaprakasa Boli of Gadadhara Dasa *Lakhyana Chandrodaya of Kabichandra Raghunatha Parichha *Sangita Kamada *Sangita Kaumudi Jayadeva, the 12th century Sanskrit saint-poet, the great composer and illustrious master of classical music, has immense contribution to Odissi music. During his time Odra-Magadhi style music got shaped and achieved its classical status. He indicated the classical ragas prevailing at that time in which these were to be sung. Prior to that there was the tradition of Chhanda. From the 16th century onwards, treatises on music were Sangitarnava Chandrika, Gita Prakasa, Sangita Kalpalata and Natya Manorama. A couple of treatise namely, Sangita Sarani and Sangita Narayana, were also written in the early path of the 19th century. The musicologists of Odisha refer to a variety of ancient texts on music such as Bharata Muni's Natyashastra, Vishnu Purana, Shiva Samhita, Brahma Samhita, Narada Samhita, Parasurama Samhita, Gita Govinda, Kohaliya, Hari Nayaka's Sangitasara, Matanga Tantra, Mammatacharya's Sangita Ratnamala, Kalankura Nibandha, Panchama Sara Samhita, Raga Viveka, Sangita Chandrika, Sangita Kaumudi, Sangita Siromani, Vanmayaviveka, Shivavivekaprabandha, Sangita Damodara and more. The aforesaid texts are thus known to have been in vogue in Odisha during the post-15th century period.  Characteristics  Odissi Sangita comprises four classes of music namely Dhruvapada, Chitrapada, Chitrakala and Panchal, described in the above- mentioned texts. The chief Odissi and Shokabaradi. Odissi Sangita (music) is a synthesis of four classes of music, i.e. Dhruvapada, Chitrapada, Chitrakala and Panchal, described in the above-mentioned texts. The Dhruvapada is the first line or lines to be sung repeatedly. Chitrapada means the arrangement of words in an alliterative style. The use of art in music is called Chitrakala. Kabisurjya Baladeba Ratha, the renowned Oriya poet wrote lyrics, which are the best examples of Chitrakala. All of these were Chhanda (metrical section) contains the essence of Odissi music. The Chhandas were composed by combining Bhava (theme), Kala (time), and Swara (tune). The Chautisha represents the originality of Odissi style. All the thirty four (34) letters of the Oriya alphabet from 'Ka' to 'Ksha' are used chronologically at the beginning of each line. A special feature of Odissi music is the padi which consists of words to be sung in Druta Tala (fast beat). Odissi music can be sung to different talas: Navatala (nine beats), Dashatala (ten beats) or Egaratala (eleven beats). Odissi ragas are different from the ragas of Hindustani and Karnataki classical music. The primary Odissi ragas are Kalyana, Nata, Shree Gowda, Baradi, Panchama, Dhanashri, Karnata, Bhairavee and Shokabaradi. Odissi music is sung through Raganga, Bhabanga and Natyanga, Dhrubapadanga followed by Champu, Chhanda, Chautisa, Pallabi, Bhajana, Janana, and Gita Govinda, which are considered to be a part of the repertoire of Odissi or an allied act form of Odissi. Odissi music has codified grammars, which are presented with specified Raagas. It has also a distinctive rendition style. It is lyrical in its movement with wave-like ornamentation. The pace of singing in Odissi is not very fast nor too slow, and it maintains a proportional tempo which is very soothing. Though there has been cross-cultural influence between Hindustani music and Persian music, Odissi music has remained relatively unaffected.  Mardala  Mardala, the traditional percussion instrument of Odissi music The Mardala is a percussive instrument native to the state of Odisha. It is traditionally used as the primary percussive instrument with Odissi music. The Mardala is different from other instruments that might have similar names in the Indian subcontinent due to its unique construction, acoustic features and traditional playing technique. Raghunatha Ratha, an ancient musicologist of Odisha extols the Mardala in his treatise, the Natyamanorama as : The Jagannatha temple of Puri has for centuries had a Mardala servitor. This was known as the 'Madeli Seba' and the percussionist was ritually initiated into the temple by the Gajapati ruler. The Mardala used to be the accompanying instrument to the Mahari dance, the ancestor of present-day Odissi dance, one of the major classical dance forms of India. In hundreds of Kalingan temples across the state of Odisha, including famous shrines such as Mukteswara and Konarka, the Mardala features prominently, usually in a niche of an alasakanya playing the instrument. There is a pose by the name mardalika replicating the same stance in Odissi dance. The playing of the Mardala is based on the tala-paddhati or rhythmic system of Odissi music. A tala is a rhythmic structure in Indian music. The talas in use in Odissi music are distinctive, and are not found in other systems of Indian music. The regional terminology used in the Mardala's context are kalƒÅ, ansƒÅ, mƒÅna, a·∏çasƒÅ, bhaunri, bhaunri a·∏çasƒÅ, tƒÅli, khƒÅli, phƒÅnka, bƒÅ·πái, uku·π≠a, pƒÅ·π≠a, chhanda, bhangi, etc. The sabda-swara pata, a traditional component based on the Mardala's beats was integrated into Odissi dance by Guru Deba Prasad Das. Though several hundred talas are defined in treatises, some are more common : ekatƒÅli, khema·π≠ƒÅ or jhulƒÅ, r≈´paka, tripa·π≠ƒÅ, jhampƒÅ, ƒÅ·∏çatƒÅli, jati, ƒÅditala, ma·π≠hƒÅ. Other talas that are also used are nihsƒÅri, ku·∏çuka, duƒÅ·∏çamƒÅna, sarimƒÅna, upƒÅ·∏ç·∏ça, pa·∏çitƒÅla, pahapa·π≠a, a·π≠·π≠atƒÅla, ƒÅ·π≠hatƒÅli and jagannƒÅtha. The talas have a characteristic swing that is typical of and universally found in Odissi music. The Mardala is intimately associated with the Jagannatha temple and thus has a very esteemed position in the culture of Odisha. Many Gurus have worked for carrying forward the legacy of the instrument. Adiguru Singhari Shyamasundar Kar, Guru Banamali Maharana, Guru Padmanabha Panda, Guru Basudeba Khuntia, Guru Mahadeba Rout, Guru Narayana Mahapatra, Guru Banamali Maharana and Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra were among the great Gurus of Mardala in the 20th century. Guru Rabinarayan Panda, Guru Jayadeba Giri, Guru Janardana Dash, Guru Dhaneswar Swain, Guru Sachidananda Das, Guru Bijaya Kumar Barik, Guru Jagannath Kuanr are among modern-day exponents of the Mardala. Many veteran Gotipua masters have also excelled in the Mardala : Guru Birabara Sahu, Guru Lingaraj Barik, Guru Maguni Das and others.  As a solo instrument  The role of the Mardala as a solo instrument has been presented for the last few decades with great success, apart from its better-known role as an accompaniment in the ensemble for Odissi music and dance. The solo performances follow a specific rule or pranali : starting with a jamana, then proceeding onto chhanda prakarana, ragada, etc. Relation with other classical music Veteran Odissi musician Shyamamani Devi, disciple of Adiguru Singhari Shyamasundar Kar and Sangita Sudhakara Balakrushna Das. The percussion instrument played with Odissi music is the Mardala. Temple sculptures in Odisha abound in statues of ‚ÄòMardala‚Äô players. At one time the Kalinga Empire extended all the way up to the river Kaveri and incorporated major parts of Karnataka. King Purusottama Deva of Odisha conquered Kanchi and married the princess. Some raagas specific to Odisha are \\"Desakhya\\", \\"Dhanasri\\", \\"Belabali\\", \\"Kamodi\\", \\"Baradi\\" etc. Additionally, some Odissi raagas bear the same names as Hindustani or Carnatic raagas, but have different note combinations. Furthermore, there are many raagas that have the same note combinations in Hindustani, Carnatic and Odissi styles, but are called by different names. Each stream, however, has its own distinct style of rendition and tonal development despite the superficial similarity in scale. Odissi music in modern times The great exponents of Odissi music in modern times are Adiguru Singhari Shyamasundara Kar, Astabadhani Acharya Tarini Charan Patra, Banikantha Nimai Charan Harichandan, Gokul Srichandan, Nrusinghanath Khuntia, Lokanath Rath, Lokanath Pala, Mohan Sundar Deb Goswami, Markandeya Mahapatra, Kashinath Pujapanda, Sangita Sudhakara Balakrushna Das, Radhamani Mahapatra, Bisnupriya Samantasinghar, Bhubaneswari Misra, Shyamamani Devi, Gopal Chandra Panda, Padmakesari Damodar Hota, Padmashree Suramani Raghunath Panigrahi, Ramahari Das who have achieved eminence in classical music.  Classicality  The renowned scholar and cultural commentator Jiwan Pani mentions four parameters that any system of music has to satisfy in order to be called 'classical' or shastric : # The tradition must be over a century old. # The system must be based on one or more written shastras or treatises. # There must be a number of ragas at the core of the system. # The ragas at the core of the system and other acquired ragas must be delineated in a distinctive style. Jiwan Pani further goes on to illustrate in his works each of these aspects with respect to Odissi music. The tradition of Odissi music is nearly a millennium old, there are several ancient musical treatises produced in the state of Odisha for several centuries, there are unique ragas and a distinctive manner of rendition. Pani further argues : > From the discussions above, it is evident that Odissi music is a distinctive > shastric (classical) system. Again, it is now accepted that Odissi dance is > undoubtedly a shastric style. Undoubtedly, music is the life breath of > dance. Therefore, it will not be logical to say that the body, that is the > Odissi dance, is shastric, but its life, that is, the music, is not > shastric. Other scholars such as Pandit Dr. Damodar Hota and Professor Dr. Ramahari Das have raised concerns over the apathy of the government & resultant lack of patronage towards preservation and popularisation of classical music traditions other than the two major systems. Dr. Hota also points to the distortion of Odissi Music as some dance musicians since the 1950s catered their music solely to the revived dance form using Hindustani and Carnatic music as reference points instead of cultivating knowledge and mastery of the distinctive classicism and performance aspects of Odissi Music. Odissi music was not as well-known as Odissi dance to musicians & dancers outside Odisha, which led to an appropriation of musical integrity and composition of dance music without adhering to the Odissi tradition. Performing Odissi dance to non-Odissi music was heavily criticised by traditional Gurus of both Odissi dance & Odissi music; it was seen as a disruption of the Odia tradition in which Odia language & literature blended harmoniously with Odissi music & Odissi dance. Most recently, in order to popularize the Odissi music the State Government's Culture Department has undertaken a massive programme named 'Odissi Sandhya' to be performed in all major cities of the country. The programme is being executed through Guru Kelu Charan Mohapatra Odissi Research Centre in association with different cultural organizations located in different parts of the country, like Central Sangeet Natak Academy, Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre, Kolkata, and Prachhin Kalakendra, Chandigarh.

Built in the late 18th and early 19th century as a speculative development on the open cliffs east of Brighton by a wealthy merchant, the 14 lodging houses formed the town's eastern boundary until about 1820. It was the seaside resort's first planned architectural composition, and the first built intentionally to face the sea. The variety of building materials used include black glazed mathematical tiles‚Äîa characteristic feature of Brighton's 18th-century architecture. English Heritage has listed the crescent at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance. An adjacent five-storey building, formerly the Royal Crescent Hotel but now converted into flats with the name Royal Crescent Mansions, is listed separately at Grade II. History Brighton's transformation from fishing village to high-class, fashionable spa town and resort happened in the second half of the 18th century and was prompted by several factors. Sea-bathing and drinking seawater became an upper-class fad, encouraged by the publication in 1750 of local doctor Richard Russell's book on the subject. The good climate‚Äîsunny, mild and breezy‚Äîalso became widely known when Brighton's first guidebook was published by Anthony Relhan in 1761. Road improvements encouraged visitors from London and elsewhere: the road from London to Brighton, notorious for its poor (sometimes impassable) condition, was turnpiked throughout its length in 1770. The arrival of royalty and the effects of their patronage then gave the town such prestige that it became Britain's largest and most important seaside resort. The Duke of Cumberland lived in the town from 1779; the Prince of Wales first visited him in 1783 (although he may also have come in search of Brighton's reputed health benefits); and he liked it so much that he came back every year and eventually took up residence at the Royal Pavilion. Late 18th-century Brighton became popular with speculative developers and builders: either professional builders who bought some land, started erecting houses themselves or using their own men, and tried to sell the remaining land at a profit as construction work continued‚Äîthis was more common; or rich speculators from other industries who bought land (sometimes from a builder in the circumstances just described) and commissioned them to build houses to their specifications. J.B. Otto, a merchant who owned plantations in the West Indies, was an example of the latter. In 1798, he bought a wide east‚Äìwest strip of land on the clifftop beyond the eastern edge of the built-up area, about east of the Royal Pavilion, and hired an architect (whose identity is not known) and builders to create a crescent of houses which could be let to long-term visitors. Work started in the same year; the ends of the crescent were started first. The project was then delayed when Otto ran out of money; he returned to the West Indies to secure more funds, then came back to Brighton and supervised the completion of the crescent, which happened in 1807. Unlike many contemporary and later developments in Brighton, Otto was able to take his time to complete it because he was not wholly dependent on it for his financial success: his plantations were still his main source of income. The crescent of 14 houses was the first to be built facing the sea and to be designed in harmony with it. Brighton's 18th-century development had been haphazard and unplanned, and Royal Crescent also represented the first unified architectural design, planned as a set-piece and overseen from start to finish by one man. The grand scale was intended to attract middle- and upper-class residents, both permanent and seasonal, and it was immediately successful: early tenants included the Rice family, a brewing dynasty from London. In 1802, Otto attempted to impress the Prince of Wales‚Äîprobably with a view to obtaining an invitation to dine with him at the Royal Pavilion, which was the pinnacle of social achievement in Brighton‚Äîby erecting a statue of him at Royal Crescent. He commissioned a sculptor called Rossi to do the work; he used Coade stone, ceramic stoneware manufactured by Eleanor Coade in London.Google Books online. Fashionable Brighton, 1820-1860 by Antony Dale. page 39 The statue was reportedly unable to withstand the weathering effects of sea-spray and strong wind: by 1807, the fingers on the sculpture's left hand had been destroyed, and soon afterwards the whole right arm dropped off. The statue began to be mistaken for Lord Nelson, and the Prince was reportedly so displeased that he forbade Otto's name to be mentioned in his presence. The dilapidated statue‚Äî tall on a plinth‚Äîwas removed in 1819. The gardens in front of the crescent, in which the statue stood, passed into the ownership of the Brighton Corporation after the 1884 Brighton Improvement Act was passed. Royal Crescent was listed at Grade II* on 13 October 1952. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Notable residents of Royal Crescent have included actor Sir John Clements‚Äîwho lived at number 7‚Äîand Sir Laurence Olivier, who lived at number 4 with his third wife Joan Plowright and also owned number 5. Architecture Black glazed mathematical tiles were much used in 18th- century Brighton. Royal Crescent forms a shallow crescent-shaped of 14 terraced houses on a generally east‚Äìwest layout behind Marine Parade. Numbers 1 and 14, the houses at each end, stand parallel to that road. Each four- storey house has common stylistic themes. There is a first-floor veranda on every house except number 1, the westernmost house, which has a balcony instead. Each veranda has curved metal roofs (with either cyma recta or cyma reversa mouldings), cast iron railings and bracketed supports. The whole terrace has a timber-framed fa√ßade with brick nogging (infilling) and covered with black glazed mathematical tiles. These were laid in an interlocking pattern to mimic brick, and were frequently used in Brighton in the late 18th century. The glazing produced an iridescent effect which reflected sunlight in a visually pleasing way, and also coped better than bricks with sea-spray and other weathering effects. The houses were originally built with bow windows, but after critics argued that this spoilt the visual effect of the concave curve of the crescent, they were replaced (except at numbers 12 and 14) by canted bay windows with three sides. A parapet, running above numbers 7‚Äì10, has the painted legend . When the painter of the lettering, a Mr Leggatt, leant back to check his work, he fell off his ladder and was fatally impaled on the metal railings below. The entrance porches and doorways to each house are considered particularly impressive. The details differ slightly from house to house, but most have open-topped pediments, entablatures, semicircular fanlights and Tuscan-style pilasters. Royal Crescent Mansions Standing slightly forward of Royal Crescent immediately to the east, the building now known as Royal Crescent Mansions was originally built as a two-storey house in the early 19th century. Former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister George Canning once lived there; this is commemorated by a heritage plaque designed by Eric Gill in the 1920s. Extension to five storeys and conversion into a hotel began in 1848, and it opened in its new form in 1857. Some remodelling took place later in the 19th century. The sea-facing fa√ßade has a three-window range: from left to right, canted, bowed and canted. Iron balconies span the second, third and fourth floors. The building has nine windows on each floor on its west fa√ßade, next to Royal Crescent, and eleven to the east (facing Burlington Street). After many years as a hotel, it was converted to flats. The building was listed at Grade II on 20 August 1971. As of February 2001, it was one of 1,124 buildings listed at that grade in Brighton and Hove; the status indicates that the building is considered \\"nationally important and of special interest\\".

This term specifically refers to the Chinese population with Hokkien ancestry in Cambodia and other neighbouring regions. Over time, this population has also emigrated locally and internationally to Thailand, Vietnam and America. These Hokkien people have either partially or wholly assimilated into the local Cambodian customs, as most evidenced by their domestic attire and lingua franca. This parallels with their Malaysian and Indonesian Peranakan counterparts where cultural remnants of their Chinese origins still define their distinct ethnicity.The Chinese in Cambodia By William E. Willmott History As early as the 1st century AD Chinese commercial traders had come to Funan by sea. Later Zhou Daguan's recorded about Chinese people in Cambodia. One of his description said:\\"The Chinese traveler frequently escape over the area, yet having individual satisfactory community. In contrast, They exceptionally have participated in Cambodian society in purpose such as food supplies, mate, shelter, furniture and business . Centralize with the tradition and law of origin abandon gain less punishment, the free immigration had open for Chinese refugee to settle in Indochina. Trace to the fleeing Hoklo people after the decline of the Tang Dynasty permanently from the 8th century to following period in terms of inner political crisis and foreign invaderism, it point out a roof that Hokkien ancestry was the first dewalling Chinese in Cambodia. It closely to the early of 15th century when Admiral Zheng He (Cheng Ho), a Muslim Chinese, visited Champa (modern-day Vietnam) along with a number of Hokkien people who then grew into the different classes such as Peranakan in Malacca and Java, as well as Cambodian Hokkien in Cambodia. In 1884, Hainanese and Hokkien descendants counted the most in Phnom Penh commonly out of the half population were Chinese. During 1880s, Two researcher noticed the different recognition between the two class's broken relation in struggles and fights. As the result, Hokkien race basically expanded to the different place and fatefully assimilate extra thing with local costume over the other classes. In fact, the reason not only the movement in 1880s but given the consequence of Hokkien's least cultural identity, Political demand and heavy compersionable idea to lead their generation spread over around Cambodia even the rural ones. Thus, have got a Cambodian Hokkien seemed not very Chinese or even not Chinese at all. Most of the Hokkien population fled Cambodia during the Cambodian Civil War as many were wealthy families, causing Cambodian Hokkiens to drop to only 8,500 in the country, 2% of the Chinese population in Cambodia in 1969. After the Khmer rouge, Cambodian-Hokkiens in distant area become less maintainable to their ancestry tradition and related themselves more to the term of Cambodian, set out begin call Hokkien while They lack elimination in Phnom Penh, attributed to Teachow people surrounding the city. Culture Just like the term, Cambodian Hokkien provided the mixture culture between Chinese and Cambodia. Despite those culture development have excessive adoption to the various of Chinese class today, it reveals that this type before only accepted by Hokkien ancestry to envovled in their daily lives since their first reach to Cambodia, left the rest classes to follow partially then. Unlike Peranakan who divided their fusion culture in isolatable section, All influence has merged in one for every kind. In case, Chinese tradition is responsible to male maintainer while the female embrace mostly in shape of Khmer. Clothing Costume of Cambodian Hokkien defines the inheritance of the two culture. The earliest female dress was identical to that of Khmer's; a knee-length blouse called Av Bopock (tube-skirt) likely the most formal outfit for an old Cambodian Hokkien women to be worn beside a white Chinese shirt and dragged a handkerchief on the shoulder or beneath the pocket. The married women regularly formed this costume in respects of wife, prior to singlehood when every young girl boasted to the long arm shirt in their home and flavoured with body-hugging called Av neang Nor in public area. A long dark tone or flower prints scarf was hang on their two shoulder. From young to old, Sampot Chang Kben became the massive typical skirt while Samloy was the most promising around the young age in more strong colourful and engaging decoration. The black colour with the front pleat back then accepted by the elders in 1930s. In contrast, The used of Khmer costume was limit for Cambodian Hokkien such as Sabai strictly banned in all ethnic family in case of naked shoulder.

While other types of Chinese have never acquired a taste for the strong smelling fish paste Prahok, Hokkien Cambodians have embraced this as a staple ingredient in their cooking.

The series is a satirical parody on religious fundamentalists, or, as the creators define it: \\"A sitcom about terrorists\\". It debuted on 20 January 2009 and has since become an internet hit with over 2 million views and worldwide fans.Guarnieri, Mya. \\"No ordinary cartoon\\", The Jerusalem Post, 4 June 2009.  Creators  Tom Trager and Or Paz are Israeli animators and comedy writers, born circa 1990. They both write, story board, animate, edit and voice the characters from an apartment in Herzliya. Though the show looks very anti- Islamic at first, Trager and Paz claim to have no real political agenda other than just \\"making people laugh\\". The satire in their show is not aimed at Muslims, but at all the fundamentalists who take religion to an extreme place. The two met during a high school film production in 2006 and created web sketches (both live-action and animated) in Hebrew until their big break with Ahmed and Salim in January 2009. Tom Trager is a graphic designer and a satirical columnist and Or Paz is a graphic designer and a video editor. Another of their series, The Shtreimels, pokes fun at ultra orthodox Jews in a similarly crude manner.  Description  The Jerusalem Post describes the show as a \\"controversial animated series about two clueless characters who surf the Net and bungle terror attacks.\\" The episodes revolve around two nerdy Arabs, Ahmed and Salim, whose father, Yasser, is a fascist anti-Semitic terrorist who wants them to follow in his footsteps, while all they want to do is play Guitar Hero and surf Facebook. The episodes will often feature Yasser sending them on a suicide mission ending with dire consequences to his own people due to Ahmed and Salim's naive and childlike nature. The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer describes the series as depicting \\"young Arabs who spend their afternoons trying to bomb Israeli buses, gun down Jewish girls and incinerate crowded cafes\\".Nissenbaum, Dion. \\"Humor or hate? Groups see Israeli cartoon differently\\" , Columbus Ledger-Enquirer, 23 April 2009.  Language  Though the characters have an Arabic accent, actual Arabic is only used occasionally. One of the most common word during the episode is Fudge and Banana. Ahmed and Salim's language is a combination of gibberish, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Greek, Hebrew, Russian and Ukrainian.  Running gags  ;Cursing : Ahmed and Salim use American and British slang when cursing. The British slang-word \\"wanker\\" is one of their favourite curse words, along with \\"dicko\\", \\"fudge-packer\\", \\"butt-burglar\\", \\"pussy\\", \\"cock- pirate\\" and \\"looza\\" (slang for \\"loser\\"). ;Shooting a wife : Yasser, the father, has a catchphrase, \\"Jar-fill mousa ya pussy!\\" (\\"Shut your mouth, you pussy!\\"), after which he usually shoots one of his wives without even looking. ;Top spin shout : Most episodes end with someone yelling \\"Ahmed and Salim\\" in top shot while the camera spins. From Yasser to Habub, a father whose son was thought to have been killed, and even Israel's \\"Big- Brother\\" host Erez Tal. ;Celebrity References : Often the \\"language\\" used by characters in this show substitute words for other things (e.g.. iPhone=Expensive Sh*t, Doctor=House). However the most prominent are references to celebrities (e.g. Talentless Shemale B*tch=Lady Gaga, Gay=Elton John, A*s Face=Alec Baldwin, Suicide=Kurt Cobain).[Ahmed and Salim, iPhone 5] Popularity According to The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer, the show has a \\"cult following\\" in Israel. The debut episode, in which the father \\"bemoans the fact that his sons haven't gone off on a suicide mission and killed lots of Jews,\\" attracted 600,000 viewers on YouTube.  Controversy  The series includes extreme scenes, which many viewers find offensive. In one of the episodes, Ahmed falls in love with a Jewish girl, who in turn develops a crush on younger brother Salim; their father resolves the conflict by shooting the girl dead. In another episode, which was taken off YouTube following complaints by shocked viewers, the father dreams he has become a \\"stinking Jewish rabbi\\" and his sons do what they were taught to do when encountering a Jew, namely shoot him in the testicles. The show has drawn the critical attention of the Arabic press.Ronen, Erex. \\"Sitcom about terrorists' makes waves\\", Israel National News, 14 April 2009. The United Arab Emirates has banned Ahmed and Salim. Palestinian bloggers have denounced it. YouTube removed one of the first six episodes and warned the creators that it could ban the entire series if new episodes are too offensive. Despite the show's offensive nature, many of Ahmed and Salim's Facebook friends are in fact Muslims and many of the show's fans are in Arab countries.

It is an evaluation tool for determining whether ICTs are really improving or worsening women‚Äôs lives and gender relations, as well as for promoting positive change at the individual, institutional, community and broader social levels. Development GEM was first developed in 2002http://idrc.ca/lacro/ev-92793-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html and was tried and tested by thirty community-based organizations. Since then, hundreds of people have become involved in GEM's development including: people who developed the tool, who train in how to use GEM, who are adapting GEM (to increase its applicability to rural ICT4D projects, telecentres, software localisation and ICT policy advocacy and who are now offering GEM evaluations on a consultancy basis. Manual The GEM manual was written in English and has been translated into French, Spanish, Brazilian, Portuguese and Arabic.GEM manuals Developers GEM was developed by the Women's Networking Support Programme of the Association for Progressive Communications (APC WNSP). Telecentres In rural Uganda, telecentres were established to promote rural access to information and foster development; however they are not getting the results they had hoped for. An evaluation of telecentres by the Acacia programme in South Africa revealed that women consistently make up less than one-third of telecentre users, even when female staff and materials that target women are made available. Seeking to understand why this is so, UgaBYTES, a Uganda-based NGO that works to promote access to ICTs in rural East Africa, conducted a study between August 2008 and March 2009 in two rural telecentres ‚Äì the Buwama Community Multimedia Centre and the Kawolo telecentre ‚Äì using and adapting GEM. The goal of the evaluation was to better understand whether or not the telecentre services were meeting the different needs of women and men. UgaBYTES found that, because technologies are socially constructed, they have different impacts on women versus men. Beyond the common obstacles to access like: technical infrastructure, connection costs and computer literacy, women face numerous additional barriers to accessing ICTs.Telecentres in Uganda do not appeal to rural women APCNews 21 January 2010 Policy impact In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first Latin American country to pledge to include a \\"gender perspective\\" in every information and communications technology (ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government. This is significant regionally as the Dominican Republic is leading the thinking of Latin American governments regarding gender and technology as part of the regional eLAC2010 plan. The Dominicans chose the Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM) as the tool to design and evaluate all public policies. The gender evaluation methodology has been used in Chhattisgarh state in India to evaluate why women, rural heads of village, are not participating actively in local government despite the fact that they are numerous in number (30% of all local government seats being reserved for women) and that they can, in theory, remotely communicate the needs of their villages through the use of a Simputer ‚Äì a low-cost computer that does not require computer literacy. The GEM study revealed that numerous technical problems related to the Simputers and ingrained inequalities, mean that even designated female representatives remain voiceless. An evaluation that does not focus on gender-related inequalities may not have uncovered these reasons.Rural e-governance in India: Women struggle to take part 2 February 2010 References Category:Evaluation methods ","title":"Gender evaluation methodology"},{"id":"26105189","text":"Ragamala.

It was sited at Rossitten, East Prussia (now Rybachy, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia), on the Curonian Spit on the south- eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. It was established by German ornithologist Johannes Thienemann and operated until 1944. In 1945 East Prussia was divided between Poland, Russia and Lithuania, and most ethnic Germans expelled. History The 98 km long Curonian Spit is a thin sand peninsula, ranging from about 400 m to 4 km in width, that separates the Baltic Sea from the shallow Curonian Lagoon. It has several settlements along its length. It lies on a major migration route for birds following the coastline of the eastern Baltic. Thienemann first visited the fishing village of Rossitten there in 1896 where he experienced ‚Äúa bird migration proceeding in a regular manner but more massive than had ever before been observed in Germany‚Äù and he ‚Äúcould not stop wondering whether something of permanent value might somehow be achieved here‚Äù. At the German Ornithological Society's 50th anniversary celebration in Leipzig in 1900 he gave a lecture that persuaded the Society to establish a bird observatory at Rossitten, as a cooperative project with the Prussian Government. Thienemann was given the job of setting it up, something accomplished when it opened on New Year's Day 1901, as well as serving as the founding director.Berthold (2003).Palmer (1940). The observatory operated under the auspices of the German Ornithological Society until 1923. From then until its dissolution in 1946 the observatory came under the management of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, giving it a solid institutional framework. Its constitution was ambitious and broad, including nine main areas of bird research: migration, behaviour, moult, economic value, protection, the establishment of a bird collection, the procurement of research material for scientific state institutes, the expansion of research relevance to other kinds of animals, and public education. Heinrich Himmler sought to use storks bred in the Rossiten observatory to distribute German propaganda in 1943, an idea that was rejected successfully by Ernst Sch√ºz. It was at first a one-man operation with Thienemann attempting to cover all areas of research. As it grew it focussed increasingly on the study of migration through banding, with roughly a million birds being banded during the 45 years of the observatory's existence. Its success stimulated the establishment of similar organisations such as the Hungarian Ornithological Centre in 1908, Heligoland Bird Observatory in 1910, Sempach Bird Observatory in 1924 and Hiddensee Ornithological Centre in 1936. Thienemann's successor as head of the observatory was Ernst Sch√ºz.Berthold (2001). Successors Vogelwarte Radolfzell Following Germany's loss of East Prussia at the end of the Second World War, the institutional inheritor of Rossitten's ornithological research program was the establishment by the Max Planck Society (the renamed Kaiser Wilhelm Society) of the ‚ÄúVogelwarte Radolfzell‚Äù, with the staff from the Rossitten observatory, at the town of Radolfzell am Bodensee at the western end of Lake Constance in Baden-W√ºrttemberg in southern Germany, under the auspices of the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology. In 1998 it became the Max Planck Research Centre for Ornithology. Biological Station Rybachy Meanwhile, at Rossiten, now the renamed Russian settlement of Rybachy, the Rybachy Biological Station was founded in 1956, at the instigation of Russian ornithologist Lev Belopolsky, as a branch of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. The station was set up following a special decision of the Board of the Academy of Sciences with the aim of studying bird migration, and of reestablishing the research tradition started by German ornithologists, after the ten-year hiatus. Viktor Dolnik was its director for 22 years, from 1967 until 1989. The station receives support from the Sielmann Foundation and works closely with western partners, including the Vogelwarte Radolfzell with which it operates a joint trapping and banding station.

The Exotarium was opened on September 27, 1987, and now has the largest collection of snakes in the world, with more than 524 species and subspecies. According to the total number of animals, Tula Exotarium occupies the second place among the Zoos of Russia EARAZA. Up to 90,000 people visit the Exotarium yearly. History In 1987 the first Zoo called Tula Exotarium was opened in Tula. At the time its collection consisted of 120 species of animals (fish, amphibians, reptiles, etc.). In 1989 a statue of a dinosaur appeared near the entrance as a symbol of this zoo's specialization in reptiles. From the start, the Exotarium began to cooperate actively with foreign colleagues, and in 1990 it received an accreditation from the Australian Society of Zoos. The Exotarium collection was regularly replenished with new species, and in 2000 it was recognized to have the largest collection of snakes in the world. In 1996 in connection with a difficult financial situation the Exotarium was put from self-financing to the regional budget financing. But it did not solve the main problem, which is the state of the old building. The current area of public exhibition is 253 square meters. 511 species of animals are kept, bred and studied here, and 90 000 people visit it every year. During these years many problems concerning construction of a new building have been solved. Thus e.g. a draft project has been approved; a hall of the future called \\"Tropical forest\\" was created at the public exhibit, besides, the place of the construction has been determined. Scientific research Successes in breeding of hundreds of species of reptiles from all the continents permitted to receive offspring from dozens of species of reptiles for the first time in the world. Together with the leading Russian scientists from the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (St. Petersburg) in Tula new methods of investigation of controversial and little-known taxa were worked out, three new species of snakes were described, more than 100 articles were published in Russian and foreign journals and two books. Together with the Russian Academy of Sciences and Vietnam the Exotarium was taking part in organization and conducting of International expeditions on studying of the most rich fauna of Vietnam in the course of 14 years. The Russian and Vietnamese herpetologists investigated a lot of mountain regions difficult to access where no scientific investigations had been conducted up to that moment. As a result, dozens new species of amphibians and reptiles were discovered and described. Many of them were captive-bred for the first time in the world practice in the laboratories of the Exotarium. Since 1987 researches of the fauna of the Tula Region have been made. Public exhibition Only the tenth part of the collection (namely 55 species) is shown at the public exhibition. Among them there is a two-meter long striped monitor lizard and a giant tortoise that weighs 135 kg, the largest one in the Zoos of Russia, as well as the species which offspring were got here for the first time in the world. For example, the long-nosed shrub racer, that had been considered as extinct, was discovered again by the collaborators of the Exotarium in Vietnam, and now due to successful breeding in Tula it has been kept and bred in many Zoos of the USA and Europe for many years now. Work with visitors Except for the public exhibition on their own or a review excursion, thematic excursions are offered to visitors; studies based on the contact with animals, competitions; festivals; temporal thematic exhibitions; events, devoted to the International campaigns, and also different programs and services for various categories of visitors are carried out. Festivals, exhibitions and other events Regularly exhibitions are organized at Exotarium, where it is possible to see very rare animals that are kept and bred in the closed scientific laboratories of the Exotarium. For example, in 2001 an exhibition-competition called International competition of beauty among snakes where visitors voted for the reptiles they liked best was organized. Different competitions and festivals are held at Exotarium, for example, competition of children‚Äôs pictures such as Zoos will save the world, Snakes‚Äô day and Birthday of Exotarium. The Exotarium and its visitors take an active part in the International campaigns on conservation of endangered species of animals, for instance, in 2008 it took part in the campaign Year of the frog.

Russia left the local institutions in place and confirmed the traditional privileges of the German nobles and burghers as was established in Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti, especially with respect to the Protestant faith.Hatlie (2005), pp. 115‚Äì116 The land reform of the so-called reduction which had been introduced by the Swedish king Charles XI, and transformed many serfs to subjects of the Crown, was reversed. The Swedish Empire formally accepted the capitulations in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721.Loit (2004), p. 72 The transfer of the Baltic provinces marked the end of Sweden's and the beginning of Russia's time as a great power.Loit (2004), p. 69 The Baltic provinces retained their special status until the late 19th century.Hatlie (2005), p. 116 Background In the pretext of the Great Northern War, August the Strong of Saxe-Poland-Lithuania and Peter the Great of Russia had agreed to conquer and partition Sweden's Baltic dominions in the Treaty of Preobrazhenskoye in 1699.Frost (2000), p. 228 During the war, Charles XII of Sweden was able to defeat the Russian army at Narva in 1700, and then pursued August the Strong to Saxony.Loit (2004), p. 70 Once the main Swedish army was gone, Russian forces were able to regroup and conquered most of the plague-stricken Baltic provinces until 1710, when the last Swedish strongholds Riga, Reval and Pernau capitulated. At this time, the main Swedish army was captured at the Surrender at Perevolochna following the Battle of Poltava. Peter the Great had in person launched the first shells in the siege of Riga, in November 1709. Terms In the Estonian and Livonian capitulations, Russia largely confirmed local law and privileges, especially the Protestant church order, thus granting administrative, economical, social and cultural autonomy.Dauchert (2006), p. 56 This included laws and privileges dating back to the Teutonic Order State and, in Estonia, Danish laws.Capitulation of Reval, first paragraph, excerpt: \\"[...] dasz von Ihro Grosz Czarischen Maytt. vor sich und ihren hohen Successoren ihnen allen von denen K√∂nigen in D√§nemarck, denen Hoch Meistern, Herren Meistern, K√∂nigen in Schweden von Zeiten zu Zeiten der Stadt und ihren Einwohnern gegebene privilegia, pacta, Immunit√§ten, Freyheiten alle wohl hergebrachte christl√∂bl.

Resolutiones in genere und in specie sowohl in spiritualibus als temporalibus werden confirmiret, und zu allen Zeiten nach dem Wortverstande ohne einige andere Deutung fest gehalten werden.\\" Luts (2006), p. 162.Capitulation of the Livonian nobles, tenth paragraph, excerpt: \\"In allen gerichten wird nach Liefl√§ndischen Privilegien wohl eingef√ºhrten Gewohnheiten, auch nach dem bekannten alten Lief-L√§ndischen Ritterrechte, und, wo diese deficieren m√∂chten, nach gemeinen Teutschen Rechten, dem landes√ºblichen Processform gem√§ss [...] decidiert [...]\\" Luts (2006), p. 160.Capitulation of the Estonian nobles, second paragraph, excerpt: \\"Alle Privilegia, Donationes, Statuten, Immunit√§ten, Alte wohlhergebrachte Landes Gewohnheiten von deren Glorw√ºrdigsten K√∂nigen in Dennemark, item denen Hoch- vnd Herr Meistern dem Lande und Adel gegebene und von Zeiten zu Zeiten confirmirte Praerogativen, wie Selbe in Ihrem tenore von Wort zu Wort lauten, zu confirmiren und zuerhalten.\\" Luts (2006), p. 161. The reduction of these privileges by Swedish absolutism had caused exiled Livonian nobleBushkovitch (2001), p. 217 and spokesman of the Livonian noblesKappeler (2008), p. 68 Johann Reinhold von Patkul to successfully lobby for war against Sweden in the pretext of the war, and their confirmation was to assure loyalty of the Baltic elites, who in the majority had fiercely resisted Russian conquest, to the tsar.Dauchert (2006), p. 54 The capitulations were concluded exclusively by the Baltic German burghers and noble class, the Estonian and Latvian speaking population was not mentioned.Dauchert (2006), p. 55 The confirmation of local law and administration resulted in many Swedish laws and decrees remaining in effect under Russian rule.Loit (2004), p. 76 For example, an incomplete list of 122 still effective Swedish decrees was published in Reval in 1777,Loit (2004), pp. 76‚Äì77 and the Swedish ecclesiastical order was only replaced in 1832.Loit (2004), p. 77 The capitulation of Livonia violated August the Strong's claims as outlined in the Treaty of Preobrazhenskoye (1699) and renewed on 9‚Äì10 October (O.S.) / 20‚Äì21 October 1709 (N.S.) in the Treaty of Thorn. When in these treaties the allies had partitioned the Swedish dominions among themselves, August was to gain Livonia. Ignoring Gerhard Johann von L√∂wenwolde's urge to heed these treaties, Boris Sheremetev had the Livonians swear allegiance to Peter the Great. L√∂wenwolde, formerly serving August the Strong, was made Peter's plenipotentiary in Livonia and held that office until 1713.Bushkovitch (2001), p. 295 Consequences Before the Swedish-Russian hostilities were concluded in Nystad (1721), the Swedish government did not accept the capitulation. Swedish intelligence operated in the occupied areas and interrogated people who escaped from these provinces to Sweden proper. In 1711 and 1712, Swedish naval units made several landfalls on the Estonian coast, burning villages and estates.Loit (2004), pp. 70‚Äì71 Greater expeditions were planned during the same time, including a naval assault on √ñsel (Saaremaa) in 1711 and a subsequent landfall with all Swedish troops stationed in Finland, but these plans were not executed.Loit (2004), p. 71 The last plan for a military recovery of the Baltic provinces was made in 1720, but this one too was not executed. The Swedish government further maintained an exiled administration of the Baltic dominions, and assigned vacant administrative positions until 1720. The Russian administration, under supreme command of Boris Sheremetev, reacted by prohibiting contacts of the local population to Sweden. On 30 August 1721, the Treaty of Nystad formalized Russia's acquisition of the Baltic provinces and the respective capitulations in articles IX, X, XI and XII.Luts (2006), p. 162 Sweden had to relinquish her claims \\"forever\\", and strike the provinces from the royal title. Peter the Great in turn changed his title from tsar to imperator, and amended it with kniaz Estlandskyi, Livlandskyi i Korelskyi, i.e. duke of Estonia, Livonia and Karelia. However, reconquest of her former Baltic dominions remained a Swedish war aim in the century following the Great Northern War,Loit (2004), pp. 70, 77ff since these territories were of high strategic importance and Livonia had been a major Swedish source for grain. Yet, none of the respective attempts during the Russo-Swedish wars of 1741‚Äì1743, 1788‚Äì1790 and 1808‚Äì1809 was successful. As Loit (2004) put it: > \\"It was the acquisition of Estonia in the year of 1561, which marked the > first step to Sweden's emergence as a European great power, and it was when > the Baltic provinces were lost to Russia in 1710 (1721), during the Northern > War, that Sweden was transformed into a second-class power again.\\"\\"Es war > die Inbesitznahme Estlands im Jahre 1561, die den ersten Schritt auf dem Weg > Schwedens zu einer europ√§ischen Gro√ümacht bildete, und es war der Verlust > der baltischen Ostseeprovinzen an Ru√üland 1710 (1721), der Schweden wieder > in eine Macht zweiten Ranges verwandelte.\\" Loit (2004), p. 69. The acquisition of Estonia and Livonia introduced a new class of Baltic German nobles to Russian courts. During the following centuries, Baltic Germans were to occupy important positions in the Russian Empire. In 1795, Early Modern Russia completed her Baltic expansion with the acquisition of Courland by a capitulation similar to the Estonian and Livonian ones, following the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.Luts (2006), p. 162 The Baltic provinces retained their special status within the Russian Empire until tsar Nicholas I started to implement Russification policies in the 1840s. Between 1883 and 1905, under tsar Alexander III, nationalist policies resulted in changes in administration and education, before the 1905 Russian revolution eased the situation. While after the conquest of the Baltic provinces Peter the Great had guaranteed that the German language retained its status as official language, Catherine II had introduced Russian as second official language, and in the 1880s, Russian was introduced as the second lingua franca.Koch (2002), pp. 59‚Äì60 Notes Sources References Bibliography     Category:Great Northern War Category:1710 in law Category:18th century in Estonia Category:18th century in Latvia Category:Swedish Livonia Category:1710 in Russia Category:1710 in Sweden Riga (1710) ","title":"Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia"},{"id":"26105421","text":"This page shows the standings and results for Group A of the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying tournament.

The Cave of the Golden Calf was a night club in London. In existence for only two years immediately before the First World War, it epitomised decadence, and still inspires cultural events. Its name is a reference to the Golden Calf of the Biblical story, an icon of impermissible worship. Description It opened in an underground location in the basements from 3 to 9 Heddon Street, near Regent Street, in 1912 and became a haunt for the wealthy and aristocratic classes, as well as bohemian artists in search of a European-style cabaret. Its creator Frida Strindberg set it up as an avant- garde and artistic venture.20thcenturylondon.org It introduced London to new concepts of nightlife and provided a solid model for future nightclubs. Philip Hoare in his book, Oscar Wilde's Last Stand, provided the following description: > Up in Regent Street young men wearing tight suits and nail varnish were > sipping creme de menthe in the Cafe Royal, while down a dark cul-de-sac > lurked a new and devilish sort of place where Futurists cavorted: a 'night > club' profanely named 'The Cave of the Golden Calf'. Vague rumours had > reached her that nowadays, the backstreets harboured all manner of such > places, attended by members of the social elite. Such intimations confirmed > all the suspicions of her class. At the root of these evils lay the name of > Oscar Wilde, still unspoken in polite households. He may have been dead for > more than a decade, but Wilde's decadence endured. nytimes.com The club is also compared with the parties of The Coterie, a group of young aristocrats and intellectuals associated with the Cambridge Souls: > Their hedonism was not confined to private parties. In 1912, Madame > Strindberg [...] leased a draper's basement in Heddon Street, a cul-de-sac > behind Regent Street, and created the Cave of the Golden Calf. This 'low- > ceilinged nightclub, appropriately sunk under the pavement', was decorated > by Spencer Gore in Russian Ballet-inspired murals, with contributions by > Jacob Epstein and Wyndham Lewis; Eric Gill designed the club's motif, a > phallic Golden Calf, symbol of biblical dissipation and idolatry. Here the > cult of Wilde could continue to worship. The club's self-advertised aim was > to be 'a place given up to gaiety', its art-subversive interiors 'brazenly > expressive of the libertarian pleasure principle ...' [...]nytimes.com Ezra Pound complimented Strindberg on her acumen. Other luminaries who frequented the establishment included Katherine Mansfield, Ford Madox Ford, Augustus John and Wyndham Lewis. Legacy The Cave went bankrupt in 1914, but its name lived on, and recently inspired a show at the Edinburgh Fringe and the 2010 Commemoration Ball at New College, Oxford.

She served during the French Revolutionary Wars and participated in one action that won for her crew a clasp to the Naval General Service Medal. A French privateer captured and sank Wolverine on 21 March 1804 whilst she was on convoy duty. Armament Unusually for a brig-sloop, she was virtually a two-deck vessel as the waist between forecastle and quarterdeck was filled in to form a continuous flush deck. The upper deck below this flush deck carried six 24-pounder carronades and two 18-pounder long guns, all mounted on centreline pivots. The gun crews could fire their weapons to either side of the vessel by rotating the carriages along grooves set into the deck firing through the eight gunports on either side to accommodate these guns. On the flush deck above she additionally carried six 12-pounder carronades (two forwards and four on the quarterdeck). The crews could also shift the carronades on her upper deck from side to side as required.Winfield (2008), p.292. Captain John Schank, who was responsible for several other nautical innovations, devised this method of arming Wolverine. French Revolutionary Wars Lieutenant Donald M'Dougall commissioned Wolverine on 28 April 1798. On 16 April 1798 command passed to the newly promoted Commander Lewis Mortlock. The next month Wolverine was part of the force under Admiral Home Popham that took part in the Ostend Raid that landed 1,300 troops under Major General Coote at Ostend in May. Shore batteries caused extensive damage to her and killed one seaman and one soldier, and wounded 10 seamen and five soldiers; the soldiers on Wolverene were from the 23rd Regiment of Foot. The army blew up the locks and gates on the Bruges canal but was then forced to surrender. \\"Captain Lewis Mortlock of His Majesty's sloop of war Wolverene of 12 guns & 70 men, who gallantly distinguished himself in attacking & defeating two French luggers of Superior Force, one of 16 guns the other 14 guns & 140 men each, off Boulogne on the 3d Janry 1799 and died in consequence of his wounds. This print is with permission dedicated to John Schank Esq, Captain in the Royal Navy, by his much obliged & obedient servant C Turner\\", National Maritime Museum, Greenwich On 28 June Wolverine was in company with the 50-gun fourth rate , , and , also later , and possibly the 24-gun post ship , when they fell in with a Swedish convoy of 21 merchant vessels and their escort, 44-gun frigate. Sweden and Britain not then being at war, Captain Lawford of Romney shadowed the convoy while sending a lieutenant back to the Admiralty for instructions. On 30 June the lieutenant returned, but his instructions are now lost. Lawford decided to detain the Swedish merchant vessels, which he did, without the Swedish frigate intervening. Ultimately, the Swedish vessels sailed into Margate where they were held for some months before the authorities sent most on their way.Debritt (1801), pp.4‚Äì8. Prize money for some part of the capture was paid in June 1804. At the end of July Wolverine captured nine Dutch fishing boats off Ostend and brought them into the Downs. On 14 October, Wolverine was in sight when the hired armed cutter Sandwich captured the Dutch hoy Hoop and her cargo. 1799 Wolverine was again in action on 3 January 1799 when she engaged the French luggers Furet and Rus√©.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, pp.169‚Äì70. The Furet carried fourteen 4-pounders and about 80 men, and was under the command of Citizen Denis Fourment; Rus√© carried eight 4-pounders and about 70 men, and was under the command of Citizen Pierre Audibert. The men from both French vessels attempted to board Wolverine but the British repelled them. The French then threw incendiary devices though Wolverine's stern cabin windows and escaped while the British were extinguishing the fire. In all, Wolverine had two men killed, and eight, including Mortlock, wounded. Furet had five men killed, her captain and five men mortally and 10 men badly wounded. Rus√© had her first and second lieutenants, another officer, and two seamen killed, and five mortally and several badly wounded.James (1837), Vol. 2, pp.313‚Äì4. Wolverine, under Lieutenant M'Dougall, sailed to Portsmouth, where she landed Mortlock on 6 January after contrary winds had forced her to spend 24 hours off the Isle of Wight. Mortlock died in his mother's arms at Gosport on 10 January, and was interred two days later after a funeral procession attended by every Captain in the port.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.176. His large Newfoundland dog, which had stood beside him throughout the fight, escaped without a scratch. Command of Wolverine was given to Captain John MacKellar, but on 24 January 1800 he was appointed to . In late 1799 Lieutenant William Bolton became her new commander. Between April and July Wolverine sailed in company with the 28-gun sloop and the Hired armed cutter Kent. Together, these three vessels captured a number of prizes. On 23 April they captured Blenie Rosetta. On 29 May they took Active and Providence. One month later, on 28 June, they captured five fishing boats. Then on 13 July they captured the Altona. Three days later they captured the Antony Wilhelm. Lastly, on 29 July, they captured the Nancy. Next, Wolverine was among the many British vessels that shared in the surrender of the Dutch Fleet at the Vlieter Incident. On 9 September Vice-Admiral Mitchell detached Arrow and Wolverine to attack a ship and a brig belonging to the Batavian Republic and anchored under the Vlie at the entrance to the Texel. Arrow had to lighten ship and the following day they crossed over the Flack abreast of Wieringen and saw the enemy in the passage leading from Vlie Island towards Harlingen. On 12 September Wolverine anchored within 60 yards of the brig and only had to fire one gun before the brig hauled down her colours. She proved to be the Gier, armed with fourteen 12-pounders. Arrow exchanged broadsides with the ship, Draak, of 24 guns (six 50-pound brass howitzers, two 32-pounder guns, and sixteen long 18-pounder guns), which surrendered when Wolverine came up. Draak turned out to be a sheer hulk so Captain Bolton burnt her. The British also captured two schooners, each of four 8-pounder guns, and four schuyts, each of two 8-pounder guns. The Dutch prisoners numbered 380 men. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasps \\"Arrow 13 Sept 1799\\" and \\"Wolverine 13 Sept. 1799\\" to any survivors of the two crews that claimed them. Arrow and Wolverine weighed on 15 September and Wolverine went to take possession of a Batavian ship, the 24-gun (Dolfijn), near Vlie which hoisted Orange colours as soon as the English came up. Two hundred and thirty prisoners were put aboard her and the command given to Lieutenant M'Dougall of Wolverine. Command of Gier, a brand new vessel, went to Lieutenant Gilmour of Arrow. On Friday 26 September Wolverine and the gun-brigs and anchored near , some 6 miles off Lemmer in West Friesland to organise an attack on the town the following morning. Captain Boorder of Espiegle had discovered that the enemy had 1,000 regular troops to defend the place and to augment the flotilla he had taken two schuyts that he had armed with two 6-pounders each from Espiegle. Early on Saturday morning Bolton sent Boorder ashore with the following letter: \\"Resistance on your part is in vain. I give you one hour to send away your women and children; if the town is not surrendered to the British arms for the Prince of Orange, your soldiers shall be buried in its ruins.\\" Commandant Van Groutten requested 24 hours delay but Bolton replied that if the Orange colours were not hoisted in half an hour, he was opening fire. Although his Dutch pilot insisted that the water was too shallow, Bolton pushed Wolverine through the oozy mud for two miles until he was a musket shot from the shore. Haughty and Piercer passed ahead until they grounded within a pistol shot of the pier, which had been reinforced with some 18-pounders from Dutch gunboats. Notwithstanding the flag of truce the enemy opened a heavy fire that the British squadron returned. The action continued for an hour until the soldiers fled from the town and a crew from Piercer's boat planted the British standard on the pier. Later the wind came round to the southward and freshened to a gale. Wolverines bow was hove around with difficulty and by using a heavy press of sail she was dragged through the mud into 11 feet of water. Flatboats pulled the gunbrigs clear. On the Monday morning the enemy advanced towards the town along the northern causeway and Bolton sent word to warn Boorder. Because the town was nearly surrounded by water, a few men in flat boats were able to defend the place and the enemy were soon in retreat. 1800 In 1800 Lieutenant Jeffery Riegersfield took command, succeeded on 16 July by Lieutenant John Wight. On 10 August he sent into Portsmouth a prize, the Catherine of Bordeaux, laden with wine.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.166. On the morning of 19 August he found that a part of an enemy convoy, consisting of two French gun-brigs and a cutter were attempting to escape from the mouth of the river Isigny and run along shore to the eastward. Supported by and the gun-vessel , he went in pursuit. The enemy ran themselves ashore in Grand Camp, the entrance being commanded by batteries on either side, which Wolverine bombarded for nearly an hour. Lieutenant Stephens of Sparkler and Lieutenant Tokeley of Force covered Lieutenant Gregory of Wolverine who went in with the cutter and the jolly boat and a party of Royal Marines to board the largest vessel and set her on fire. They were under fire from three field pieces and about 200 men with muskets. The other vessel was completely shot through. The only casualties were three men on Wolverine who were burnt by an explosion of gunpowder. The enemy lost at least four men killed on the beach. When Wolverine entered Portsmouth on 17 September she brought with her Neptunus, laden with naval stores, that Wight had captured when she was going into Havre de Grace.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.252. Wolverine shared the prize money with Oiseau and the cutter Fly. On 2 November Wight discovered a French cutter under the land about 4 miles E. S. E. of Cape Barfleur light-house. He prevented her getting round the Cape and ran her ashore inside a reef of rocks under the village of Gouberville. She struck hard and because a gale was blowing up he assumed that she would be destroyed. Riegersfield again took temporary command. 1801 Wolverine, Loire, , , , and the hired armed cutter Swift shared in the capture on 11 and 12 August 1801 of the Prussian brigs Vennerne and Elizabeth. Wolverine paid off and was put into ordinary on 29 April 1802, when Lieutenant Wight was promoted to Commander. Loss Wolverine was recommissioned in November 1803 under Lieutenant Henry Gordon. She then served as a convoy escort in the North Atlantic. Wolverine was in action on 21 March 1804 with the French 30-gun privateer while on passage to Newfoundland with a convoy of eight merchantmen.Gossett (1986), p.40. Wolverine sighted two strange vessels. When it became clear that they were French frigates, Wolverine sent the convoy on its way and sailed to intercept the frigates. The larger of the two French frigates sailed to engage Wolverine, while the smaller one sailed after the merchantmen.Hepper (1994), p.104. Wolverine was finally forced to surrender after an hour-long fight and losing five men killed and 10 wounded, one mortally. She was so badly damaged that she sank within a quarter-hour of her surrender, though the French rescued the surviving crew. Blonde, under Fran√ßois Aregnaudeau, out of a complement of 240 men and boys, lost only her first lieutenant mortally, and five of her men slightly wounded. The court martial on 17 August 1804 attributed Wolverine's loss on the defective state of her gun carriages ‚Äì a mass of complicated timber and machinery ‚Äì that the enemy's first two broadsides had rendered useless. Post script HMS Loire captured Blonde five months later on 17 August. Also in August a letter arrived in Portsmouth from one of Wolverines officers that reported that Wolverines crew had been marched nearly 900 miles to Verdun from where they were landed. Captain Gordon and his officers were well, and had not been ill-treated.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.339. Blondes captain was Fran√ßois Aregnaudeau. He was captain of the privateer , when she disappeared in 1812.

He was one of the founders of p-adic Hodge theory. He was a professor at Paris-Sud 11 University from 1988 to his death.  Life  In 1962 Fontaine entered the √âcole Polytechnique, from 1965 to 1971 was a researcher at CNRS and received his doctorate in 1972. From 1971 to 72 he was at the University of Paris VI and from 1972 to 1988 was at the University of Grenoble (only Ma√Ætre de Conferences, but later a professor). From 1989 he was professor at the University of Paris-Sud XI in Orsay. Among his first works was the classification of p-divisible groups (= Barsotti‚ÄìTate group) over the ring of integers of a local field and the field of p-adic periods, a p-adic analogue of the field of complex numbers. Fontaine is one of the founders of p-adic Hodge theory. He proved that there are no non-trivial abelian varieties over the rational numbers with good reduction everywhere (Il n'y a pas de vari√©t√© ab√©lienne sur Z, Inventiones Mathematicae vol. 81, 1985, p. 515). He introduced the concept of geometric Galois representation of the Galois group of a number field. He also worked on Bloch-Kato conjectures. In 1984 he received the Prix Carri√®re from the French Academy of Sciences. Beginning in 2002 he was a member of the French Academy of Sciences. In 2002 he was awarded the Gay-Lussac-Humboldt Prize. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Warsaw 1983 (Repr√©sentations p-adiques) and Beijing 2002 (analyse p-adique et repr√©sentations galoisiennes).

The phrase was coined by Jim Pickard of the Financial Times in the run up to the general election of 2010 and describes a type of floating voter who it is believed can determine the outcome of an election by the way he casts his vote. The name is derived from the idea that this type of voter lives on a modern housing estate, with easy access to the motorway network. Description The term covers male and female voters. The Motorway Man is seen as the successor to both the Essex Man and the Mondeo Man, who respectively backed Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s and Tony Blair during the 1990s. According to an article in The Observer from February 2010, the term \\"Motorway man\\" has been used to describe \\"childless, youngish voters who live in modern homes close to the main motorway networks, the less environmentally attractive pockets of England where planning permission for new developments is often easier to obtain.\\" On 22 January 2010, the Financial Times defined Motorway man as \\"aspirational, materialistic and car dependent.\\" In terms of occupation, Motorway man might be a regional sales manager, sales rep or production manager; a person who needs to be near a motorway to get around the country. The MOSAIC database, which divides the British population into different sections, and is used by the United Kingdom's three main political parties, Labour, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, portrays Motorway Man as \\"exerting vital influence in marginal seats across southern England\\". 21 constituencies, located in the Midlands and North of England and adjacent to the M1, M6 and M61 were identified as marginal constituencies where \\"Motorway man\\" could influence the outcome of the general election. Among the constituencies where \\"Motorway man\\" is thought to reside include: South Derbyshire, North West Leicestershire, Broxtowe, Loughborough, Kingswood, Warwick and Leamington, Worcester, Telford, Rugby, Nuneaton, Tamworth, Stafford, Bolton West, Chorley, West Lancashire, Milton Keynes North and Milton Keynes South. Characteristics The typical \\"Motorway man\\" is described as follows; *Young singles or couples, usually childless. *Homes worth less than they paid for them. *Live in new, purpose built estates close to major infrastructure. *New to managing their own domestic arrangements. *Unfamiliar with running their finances. *Rely on internet search engines for information about products and services, which they buy over the telephone or on the internet. *Increasingly affected by the growth of \\"viral\\" marketing, and responsive to information sent using text messaging and direct mail. *Live in houses with small kitchens, so are reluctant to cook.

The documents were redistributed first through several blogs of global warming deniers, who alleged that the documents indicated misconduct by leading climate scientists. A series of investigations rejected these allegations, while concluding that CRU scientists should have been more open with distributing data and methods on request. Precisely six committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct.The six major investigations covered by secondary sources include: House of Commons Science and Technology Committee (UK); Independent Climate Change Review (UK); International Science Assessment Panel (UK); Pennsylvania State University (US); United States Environmental Protection Agency (US); Department of Commerce (US). The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged by the end of the investigations.Biello, David (Feb., 2010). \\"Negating 'Climategate'\\".

House Hearing, 111 Congress. U.S. Government Printing Office. \\"...the e-mails really do nothing to undermine the very strong scientific consensus and the independent scientific analyses of thousands of scientists around the world that tell us that the Earth is warming and that the warming is largely a result of human activities.\\" As quoted in the report published by Office of Inspector General. The incident occurred shortly before the opening December 2009 Copenhagen global climate summit. It has prompted general discussion about increasing the openness of scientific data (though the majority of climate data have always been freely available). Scientists, scientific organisations, and government officials have stated that the incident does not affect the overall scientific case for climate change. Andrew Revkin reported in The New York Times that \\"The evidence pointing to a growing human contribution to global warming is so widely accepted that the hacked material is unlikely to erode the overall argument.\\" Content of the documents The material comprised more than 1,000 e-mails, 2,000 documents, as well as commented source code, pertaining to climate change research covering a period from 1996 until 2009. Some of the e-mails which have been widely publicised included discussions of how to combat the arguments of climate change sceptics, unflattering comments about sceptics, queries from journalists, and drafts of scientific papers. There have been assertions that these discussions indicated efforts to shut out dissenters and their points of view, and included discussions about destroying files in order to prevent them from being revealed under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000. A review by the Associated Press of all the e-mails found that they did not support claims of faking of science, but did show disdain for critics. Scientists had discussed avoiding sharing information with critics, but the documents showed no evidence that any data was destroyed. Researchers also discussed in e-mails how information they had released on request was used by critics to make personal attacks on researchers. In an interview with The Guardian, Phil Jones said \\"Some of the emails probably had poorly chosen words and were sent in the heat of the moment, when I was frustrated. I do regret sending some of them. We've not deleted any emails or data here at CRU.\\" He confirmed that the e-mails that had sparked the most controversy appeared to be genuine.Hickman, Leo, \\"and agencies\\", \\"Climate scientist at centre of leaked email row dismisses conspiracy claims\\", 24 November 2009, The Guardian. Retrieved 25 November 2009. E-mails Most of the e-mails concerned technical and mundane aspects of climate research, such as data analysis and details of scientific conferences. The controversy has focused on a small number of e-mails, particularly those sent to or from climatologists Phil Jones, the head of the CRU, and Michael E. Mann of Pennsylvania State University (PSU), one of the originators of the graph of temperature trends dubbed the \\"hockey stick graph\\". Climate change deniers gained wide publicity for allegations that the hacked e-mails showed climate scientists colluded in manipulating data, withheld scientific information, and tried to prevent dissenting scientific papers from being published in peer reviewed journals. Academics and climate change researchers said that nothing in the emails proved wrongdoing, and dismissed the allegations. Independent reports said that the e-mails did not affect evidence that man made global warming is a real threat, and e-mails were being misrepresented to support unfounded claims of scientific misconduct, but there were disturbing suggestions that scientists had avoided sharing scientific data with sceptical critics. The Information Commissioner's Office stated that \\"the prima facie evidence from the published e-mails indicate an attempt to defeat disclosure by deleting information. It is hard to imagine more cogent prima facie evidence. ... The fact that the elements of a [FOIA] section 77 offence may have been found here, but cannot be acted on because of the elapsed time, is a very serious matter.\\" The Science and Technology Select Committee criticised the ICO for making \\"a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate\\", but also blamed the university for mishandling Freedom of Information requests and called for a full investigation to resolve the questions raised. The Associated Press conducted a review of the e-mails and concluded that they showed scientists fending off critics, but did not support claims that global warming science had been faked. They stated that \\"One of the most disturbing elements suggests an effort to avoid sharing scientific data with critics skeptical of global warming\\", and mentioned ethical problems with this action due to the fact that \\"free access to data is important so others can repeat experiments as part of the scientific method\\". They cited a science policy expert as stating that it was \\"normal science politics, but on the extreme end, though still within bounds\\". The AP sent the emails to three climate scientists they selected as moderates, who did not change their view that man-made global warming is a real threat. The three scientists are on the record elsewhere supporting an outside, independent review of the allegations of misconduct at both the CRU and Pennsylvania State University. Summarising its own analysis, FactCheck stated that claims by climate sceptics that the emails demonstrated scientific misconduct amounting to fabrication of global warming were unfounded, and emails were being misrepresented to support these claims. While the emails showed a few scientists being rude or dismissive, this did not negate evidence that human activities were largely responsible for global warming, or the conclusions of the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report which used the CRU as just one of many sources of data. An editorial in the scientific journal Nature stated that the e-mails had not shown anything that undermined the scientific case on human caused global warming, or raised any substantive reasons for concern about the researchers' own papers. Scientific openness requires public availability of data used to reach conclusions, but researchers had been hampered in this by contractual restrictions on some data, and in certain countries national meteorological services were too slow to provide data sets on request. The e-mail theft highlighted \\"the harassment that denialists inflict on some climate-change researchers, often in the form of endless, time-consuming demands for information under the US and UK Freedom of Information Acts. Governments and institutions need to provide tangible assistance for researchers facing such a burden.\\" While scientists are human and \\"unrelenting opposition to their work can goad them to the limits of tolerance\\", they \\"should strive to act and communicate professionally, and make their data and methods available to others, lest they provide their worst critics with ammunition.\\" The IPCC's chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, described the CRU's scientists \\"as highly reputed professionals, whose contributions over the years to scientific knowledge are unquestionable\\" and described their datasets as \\"totally consistent with those from other institutions, on the basis of which far-reaching and meaningful conclusions were reached in the [2007 IPCC report].\\" On 24 November the University of East Anglia issued a statement on the contents of the e-mails: \\"There is nothing in the stolen material which indicates that peer-reviewed publications by CRU, and others, on the nature of global warming and related climate change are not of the highest quality of scientific investigation and interpretation.\\" In its report to the Science and Technology Select Committee of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Institute of Physics stated that the emails reveal evidence of \\"determined and coordinated refusals\\" to comply with scientific traditions through \\"manipulation of the publication and peer-review system\\" and \\"intolerance to challenge\\".Climategate scientist questioned in Parliament. 2 March 2010. New Scientist] This report was used by climate sceptics to bolster claims that the problem of global warming is exaggerated. This forced the Institute of Physics to confirm that its position was that \\"the basic science is well enough understood to be sure that our climate is changing, and that we need to take action now to mitigate that change.\\" Many experts considered that the correction was still inadequate, with climatologist Andy Russell describing the allegation of data suppression as \\"incorrect and irresponsible\\". The institute said that the statement had been prepared by their energy subcommittee, but would not reveal who had produced it. It did say that the subcommittee included an IOP official named Peter Gill, whose company provides services to the energy industry and who has written that for many people, the subject of anthropogenic global warming \\"has become a religion, so facts and analysis have become largely irrelevant\\".Times Online ‚Äì Energy consultant 'influenced climate evidence' The institute said that Gill was not the main source of information and that other members of the sub- committee were also critical of CRU. Evan Harris, a Liberal Democrat member of the Science and Technology Select Committee, said \\"Members of the Institute of Physics ... may be concerned that the IOP is not as transparent as those it wishes to criticise.\\" However the institute told the Guardian that the submission was \\"approved by three members of its science board\\" and supplied comments from an anonymous board member stating \\"The institute should feel relaxed about the process by which it generated what is, anyway, a statement of the obvious... the points [the submission] makes are ones which we continue to support, that science should be practiced openly and in an unbiased way.\\"Climate emails inquiry: Energy consultant linked to physics body's submission Environment The Guardian Climate reconstruction graph thumb|400px|Figure prepared by Phil Jones for the WMO \\"Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 1999\\". The caption inside the report describing it states \\"Northern Hemisphere temperatures were reconstructed for the past 1000 years (up to 1999) using palaeoclimatic records (tree rings, corals, ice cores, lake sediments, etc.), along with historical and long instrumental records\\". Version of the graph above with the climate reconstructions (coloured) and instrumental temperatures (annual & summer in black) shown separately. The right end of the green line shows the \\"decline\\" due to the divergence problem with certain tree-ring proxy data. The most quoted phrase took words from an e-mail of 16 November 1999 written by Phil Jones which referred to a graph he was preparing as a diagram for the cover of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) statement on the status of global climate in 1999. Jones wrote: :\\"I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie, from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.\\" The \\"trick\\" was a technique to combine data series, and \\"the decline\\" was a well known issue with Keith Briffa's reconstruction using certain tree ring proxies which appeared to decline after 1950, when measured temperatures were rising. The email was widely misquoted as a \\"trick\\" to \\"hide the decline\\" as though it referred to a decline in measured global temperatures, but this was obviously untrue as when the email was written temperatures were far from declining: 1998 had been the warmest year recorded. On 9 December 2009 Sarah Palin said the truncated phrase showed a \\"highly politicised scientific circle\\" had \\"manipulated data to 'hide the decline' in global temperatures\\", and at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, senator Senator Jim Inhofe quoted Jones, and said \\"Of course he means hide the decline in temperatures\\". The graph showed three series of paleoclimate reconstructions, based on records of tree rings, corals, ice cores, lake sediments, etc., along with historical and instrumental records. \\"Mike's Nature trick\\" referred to Michael E. Mann's paper on temperature trends published by Michael Mann in Nature in 1998, which combined various proxy records and related them to actual temperature records: it included a figure later dubbed the hockey stick graph, which clearly distinguished between the proxy and instrumental data. Mann described the \\"trick\\" as simply a concise way of showing the two kinds of data together while still clearly indicating which was which. He said that there was nothing \\"hidden or inappropriate\\" about it, and that his method of combining proxy data had been corroborated by numerous statistical tests and matched thermometer readings taken over the past 150 years. A press release by the University of East Anglia said that the \\"trick\\" was using instrumental data to meet a requirement of showing temperatures more recent than those covered by the proxy based temperature reconstructions, and that the use of the word \\"trick\\" was not intended to imply any deception. An editorial in Nature said that 'trick' was slang for a clever (and legitimate) technique. The phrase \\"hide the decline\\" referred specifically to the divergence problem in which some post 1960 tree ring proxy data indicates a decline while measured temperatures rise. The reconstruction by Briffa et al. was based solely on tree ring data, which shows a strong correlation with temperature from the 19th century to the mid 20th century. They had published a statement on the divergence problem in 1998, and had recommended that the post 1960 part of their reconstruction should not be used. Jones stated that the email was \\"written in haste\\" and that, far from seeking to hide the decline, CRU had published a number of articles on the problem. The implications of the decline are discussed in Chapter 2 of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, and in Chapter 6 of the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)IPCC Third Assessment Report WG1, Section 2.3.2.1, \\"high latitude tree-ring density variations have changed in their response to temperature in recent decades, associated with possible non-climatic factors (Briffa et al., 1998a) ....\\" which describes discussion of various possible reasons for the divergence which does not affect all the trees, and says that there is no consensus about the cause. It notes that Briffa et al. specifically excluded the post 1960 data, which is therefore not shown in the graph of their tree ring reconstruction in the AR4 report. John Tierney wrote in The New York Times that \\"the graph adorned the cover of a report intended for policy makers and journalists. The nonexperts wouldn‚Äôt have realized that the scariest part of that graph ‚Äì the recent temperatures soaring far above anything in the previous millennium ‚Äì was based on a completely different measurement from the earlier portion. It looked like one smooth, continuous line leading straight upward to certain doom.\\"\\"E-Mail Fracas Shows Peril of Trying to Spin Science\\" by John Tierney, The New York Times, published 30 November 2009 Tierney quotes Michael E. Mann replying to a denier who raised this very issue about tree-ring data at the RealClimate blog, \\"No researchers in this field have ever, to our knowledge, 'grafted the thermometer record onto' any reconstruction. It is somewhat disappointing to find this specious claim (which we usually find originating from industry- funded climate disinformation Web sites) appearing in this forum.\\" Tierney continued, \\"Dr. Mann now tells me that he was unaware, when he wrote the response, that such grafting had in fact been done in the earlier cover chart, and I take him at his word. But I don‚Äôt see why the question was dismissed so readily, with the implication that only a tool of the fossil-fuel industry would raise it.\\" In December 2009, most scientists interviewed by The Philadelphia Inquirer considered there was ample other evidence supporting the original graph and they had not changed their views on the issues. In an exception, Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology alleged that the emails \\"explicitly refer to falsification and rigging of data\\" in covering up the divergence problem of tree ring proxies for the 1960s, which he said called earlier periods into question, and said \\"The trick here is replacing the kind of data you're using with something to make it look different.\\". Other climatologists disputed Lindzen's accusations. Thomas Peterson of the National Climatic Data Center said he had seen nothing in the emails that called the fundamental science into question, and Andrew Solow of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution agreed that there was no trickery, saying he would use the word trick to describe some methodological step, but expressed the view that the basis of reconstructions had been unclear. Several scientific sources state that the decline being referred to is a decline in tree ring climate proxy metrics, not temperature.The Philadelphia Inquirer, 3 December 2009: Penn State professor: Research is sound, last accessed 20091207 Andrew Watson, Royal Society Research Professor at the UEA, said that the scientists had drawn the line to follow the tree-ring reconstruction up to 1960 and the measured temperature after that.\\" Before the incident, Mann and others had presented reconstructions based on more proxies, and found similar results with or without the tree ring records. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had issued an \\"endangerment finding\\" in 2009 in preparation for climate regulations on excessive greenhouse gases. Petitions to reconsider this citing the email were raised by the state of Texas and conservative activists and business groups the Coalition for Responsible Regulation, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the coal company Peabody Energy. They said the email \\"evidences CRU staff‚Äôs effort to deliberately manipulate data to yield desired results\\", and highlighted the word \\"trick\\". The Southeastern Legal Foundation said it showed \\"an attempt to cook the books to conceal the fact that the famous 'hockey stick' is a manipulated, misleading barrel of scientific nonsense.\\" The EPA rejected these allegations as both irrelevant and inaccurate, noting that the WMO cover illustration by Jones bore no relationship to the IPCC assessment reports, and used different methods. The issues with tree rings had not been hidden, but were extensively discussed in scientific literature and in IPCC reports. The EPA agreed with the UK Science & Technology Committee conclusion that \\"We are content that the phrases such as 'trick' or 'hiding the decline' were colloquial terms used in private e-mails, and the balance of evidence is that they were not part of a systematic attempt to mislead.\\" Peer review issue In response to an e-mail mentioning a recent paper in the scientific journal Climate Research that questioned assertions that the 20th century was abnormally warm, Mann wrote in an e-mail of 11 March 2003: :\\"I think we have to stop considering Climate Research as a legitimate peer- reviewed journal. Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal.\\" Mann told the Wall Street Journal that he didn't feel there was anything wrong in saying \\"we shouldn't be publishing in a journal that's activist.\\" Mann was not alone in expressing concern about the peer review process of the journal. Half of the journal's editorial board, including editor-in-chief Hans von Storch, resigned in the wake of controversy surrounding the article's publication. The publisher later admitted that the paper's major findings could not \\"be concluded convincingly from the evidence provided in the paper. [Climate Research] should have requested appropriate revisions of the manuscript prior to publication.\\"Climate Research: an article unleashed worldwide storms In an 18 December 2009 column in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Pat Michaels alleged that pressure from Jones and Mann was responsible for the resignations at Climate Research.Michaels, Pat, \\"How to Manufacture a Climate Consensus\\", The Wall Street Journal, 18 December 2009; \\"Sceptical climatologist and Cato Institute fellow\\" Michaels's statement characterized as \\"allegations\\" in: Pearce, Fred, \\"Emails reveal strenuous efforts by climate scientists to 'censor' their critics\\", The Guardian, 9 February 2010. In a response also published in the WSJ, von Storch said that he left the post as chief editor of Climate Research \\"with no outside pressure, because of insufficient quality control on a bad paper ‚Äì a skeptic's paper, at that.\\"Von Storch, Hans, \\"Good Science, Bad Politics\\", The Wall Street Journal, 22 December 2009.Pearce, Fred, \\"Emails reveal strenuous efforts by climate scientists to 'censor' their critics\\", The Guardian, 9 February 2010. Michaels said the incident demonstrated how peer reviewed literature had been biased to prevent himself and others of like mind from publishing. In a response published by the WSJ, Mann said the only bias was for \\"well-reasoned writing that is buttressed by facts\\" and climate change deniers such as Richard Lindzen and John Christy had no problems with publishing their work in mainstream journals. He pointed to presidential science adviser John Holdren's 2003 statement that Michaels had \\"published little if anything of distinction in the professional literature, being noted rather for his shrill op-ed pieces and indiscriminate denunciations of virtually every finding of mainstream climate science.\\"Mann, Michael, \\"Science Must Be Unpolluted by Politics\\", The Wall Street Journal, 31 December 2009. The independent review commissioned by the University of East Anglia found that the strong reaction of the scientists to the Soon and Baliunas paper \\"was understandable, and did not amount to undue pressure on Climate Research.\\" p. 65 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was petitioned about this issue by the Coalition for Responsible Regulation, the Ohio Coal Association, Peabody Energy, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, and the State of Texas The EPA concluded that the emails expressed displeasure but did not show that any action was in fact taken, and it is \\"expected and appropriate that researchers choose in which journals to publish, as well as recommend to their peers journals in which to publish or not publish. In this case, the bottom line is that the underlying science at issue has been shown to be flawed. The scientists' actions were focused on this lack of scientific merit and the process that lead to it, and not an attempt to distort the science or the scientific literature.\\" The EPA considered that \\"If anything, their actions aimed to police the peer review process and rectify a problem that threatened its scientific integrity.\\" pp. 48‚Äì51, 64‚Äì65, 73‚Äì76 Alleged exclusion of papers from IPCC report In July 2004, referring to Climate Research having published a paper by \\"MM\\", thought to be Ross McKitrick and Pat Michaels, and another paper by Eugenia Kalnay and Ming Cai, Jones emailed his colleagues saying, \\"I can't see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin [Trenberth] and I will keep them out somehow ‚Äì even if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature is!\\" At that time, Jones and Kevin E. Trenberth were lead authors on a chapter in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. Trenberth told the investigating journalist \\"I had no role in this whatsoever. I did not make and was not complicit in that statement of Phil's. I am a veteran of three other IPCC assessments. I am well aware that we do not keep any papers out, and none were kept out. We assessed everything [though] we cannot possibly refer to all literature... Both of the papers referred to were in fact cited and discussed in the IPCC.\\" He also made a statement agreed with Jones, that \\"AR4 was the first time Jones was on the writing team of an IPCC assessment. The comment was naive and sent before he understood the process.\\" Jones could have been expected to be aware of the rules as he had been a contributing author for more than ten years, but this was his first time as a lead author with a responsibility for content of the complete chapter. The IPCC has stated that its procedures mean there is \\"no possibility of exclusion of any contrarian views, if they have been published in established journals or other publications which are peer reviewed.\\" Its chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, stated that the papers that had been criticised \\"were actually discussed in detail in chapter six of the Working Group I report of the AR4 (IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). Furthermore, articles from the journal Climate Research, which was also decried in the emails, have been cited 47 times in the Working Group I report.\\" A Nature editorial stated that the UEA scientists had been sharply critical of the quality of the two papers, but \\"neither they nor the IPCC suppressed anything: when the assessment report was published in 2007 it referenced and discussed both papers.\\" Peter Kelemen, a professor of geochemistry at Columbia University's Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said that \\"If scientists attempted to exclude critics' peer-reviewed papers from IPCC reports, this was unethical in my view.\\" Rajendra Pachauri responded that the IPCC has \\"a very transparent, a very comprehensive process which ensures that even if someone wants to leave out a piece of peer reviewed literature there is virtually no possibility of that happening.\\" Freedom of information Several e-mails relating to freedom of information issues were the focus of controversy. In a 2 February 2005 e-mail, Phil Jones advised Michael Mann: :\\"And don't leave stuff lying around on ftp sites ‚Äì you never know who is trawling them. The two MMs have been after the CRU station data for years. If they ever hear there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK, I think I'll delete the file rather than send to anyone. Does your similar act in the US force you to respond to enquiries within 20 days?‚Äîour does! The UK works on precedents, so the first request will test it. We also have a Data Protection Act, which I will hide behind. In another e-mail sent in May 2008, Jones asked Mann: :\\"Can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith re AR4? Keith will do likewise.... Can you also email Gene and get him to do the same? I don't have his new email address.\\" Before the emails were published, Jones had already announced in Nature News (on 12 August 2009) that he was working to release the raw data in a systematic way, and was writing to all the National Meteorological Organisations requesting their agreement to waive confidentiality. On 24 November 2009, four days after the start of the email controversy, the university stated that over 95% of the CRU climate data set had already been available for several years, and the remainder would be released when permissions were given. Critics asserted that the e-mails showed that scientists were conspiring to delete e-mails and documents to prevent them from being released. George Monbiot, a supporter of the scientific consensus, wrote that Jones' resignation was warranted on the basis of his statement in this email alone, a statement Monbiot later retracted. Pro-Vice Chancellor of Research at the University of East Anglia, Trevor Davies, said that no data were deleted or \\"otherwise dealt with in any fashion with the intent of preventing the disclosure\\". In response to allegations that CRU avoided obligations under the UK Freedom of Information Act, independent investigator Muir Russell plans to review CRU's \\"policies and practices regarding requests under the Freedom of Information Act\\". The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) oversees the application of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The Deputy Information Commissioner, Graham Smith, issued a statement which was published on 27 January 2010 and said that the e-mails showed that an FOI request made by David Holland, a climate sceptic from Northampton, had \\"not [been] dealt with as they should have been under the legislation.\\" Section 77 of the FOI Act prohibited public authorities from intentionally preventing the disclosure of restricted information, but it was too late to impose sanctions as there was a six-month statutory time limit. He was advising the university of East Anglia on its legal obligations, and the ICO would be considering whether to take regulatory action once reports of the independent and police investigations were available. The university said it had not been made aware of the statement by Smith. In its submission to the Science and Technology Select Committee, the university denied allegations that it had refused to release raw data in breach of the FOIA. It subsequently released an exchange of correspondence with the Information Commissioner's Office to clarify that, in their opinion, the University had not been found in breach of any part of the FOI Act. UEA stated that the ICO had not completed its investigations and had not established any breach of the law, and that it had not sought any further evidence on the matter. It said that the ICO statement only referred to prima facie evidence, and that Mr. Holland's request at issue concerned private e-mails. The letter from the ICO had stated that \\"the prima facie evidence from the published e-mails indicate an attempt to defeat disclosure by deleting information. It is hard to imagine more cogent prima facie evidence. ... The fact that the elements of a [FOIA] section 77 offence may have been found here, but cannot be acted on because of the elapsed time, is a very serious matter.\\" Evan Harris, a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament, told The Times that it would be unwise for the university to attempt to portray the ICO's letter in a positive light, as the correspondence would be examined by the committee. The UEA told the newspaper that the point being made in their submission was that \\"there has been no investigation so no decision, as was widely reported. The ICO read e-mails and came to assumptions but has not investigated or demonstrated any evidence that what may have been said in emails was actually carried out.\\"University ‚Äòtried to mislead MPs on climate change e-mails‚Äô, The Times 27 February 2010. The university said that the point being made in their submission was that \\"there has been no investigation so no decision, as was widely reported. The ICO read e-mails and came to assumptions but has not investigated or demonstrated any evidence that what may have been said in emails was actually carried out.\\" The Science and Technology Select Committee report blamed the university for mishandling Freedom of Information requests and said it had \\"found ways to support the culture at CRU of resisting disclosure of information to climate change sceptics\\". The committee also criticised the ICO, and said that it made \\"a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate\\", but accepted that the six-month statute of limitations restriction was insufficient, and said that this should be reviewed. It called for a full investigation by the Muir Russell inquiry or by the Information Commissioner, to resolve the question of whether there had been a breach of Section 77 of the FOIA. In an e-mail of 12 November 2009, climate scientist Benjamin Santer of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory commented on an FOI request for data and correspondence from climate sceptic blogger Stephen McIntyre: :\\"My personal opinion is that both FOI requests [for data related to a 2008 paper and for correspondence dating back to 2006] are intrusive and unreasonable. Steven McIntyre provides absolutely no scientific justification or explanation for such requests.... McIntyre has no interest in improving our scientific understanding of the nature and causes of climate change. He has no interest in rational scientific discourse.... We should be able to conduct our scientific research without constant fear of an \\"audit\\" by Steven McIntyre; without having to weigh every word we write in every email we send to our scientific colleagues.\\" In an Associated Press interview, McIntyre disagreed with his portrayal in emails, and said \\"Everything that I've done in this, I've done in good faith.\\" FactCheck stated that the great majority of CRU's data is already freely available, and the scientists were reluctant to supply their own correspondence, code and data to people whose motives seemed questionable to them. It is not clear that any deliberate obstruction happened, and emails show the scientists discussing with university officials and lawyers their obligations under the new legislation, informing critics that data is already freely available, or that the information has been sent to them. This question is to form part of the East Anglia investigation. The University of East Anglia stated that the great majority of CRU climate data was already freely available, but the remainder was mainly owned by National Meteorological Services around the globe and subject to non-publication agreements. The Met Office was requesting new agreements to allow it to republish the raw data. CRU has a web page describing the progress that had previously been made in releasing this data, and giving details of non- publication agreements including the restrictions placed by the Met office on use of its data for bona fide research programmes. In a later BBC interview, Phil Jones said that the land station records developed at CRU show close agreement with the independent NCDC and GISS official records, which are based on raw data freely available from the Global Historical Climatology Network. In response to the Met Office requests, some National Meteorological Services gave full or conditional agreement, others failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by Trinidad and Tobago and Poland. In discussions with the ICO about FOIA requests which had been made before the email controversy had begun, the university argued that the data was publicly available from the Met organisations, and the lack of agreement exempted the remaining data. In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO stated that the data was not easily available and there was insufficient evidence that disclosure would have an adverse effect on international relations. The ICO required the university to release the data covered by the FOIA request within 35 calendar days. FOI request made 24 July 2009, refused by UEA 14 August 2009. FOI request made 14 August 2009, refused by UEA 11 September 2009. On 27 July 2011 CRU announced release of the raw instrumental data not already in the public domain, with the exception of Poland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request. The data are available for download from Met Office website and from CRU. The university remained concerned \\"that the forced release of material from a source which has explicitly refused to give permission for release could have some damaging consequences for the UK in international research collaborations.\\" Gaps in understanding temperature variations Critics also highlighted a passage in an e-mail sent by Kevin Trenberth on 12 October 2009 that discussed gaps in scientific understanding of recent temperature variations, in which Trenberth wrote: :\\"The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't,\\" Trenberth told the Associated Press that the email referred to an article he authored calling for improvement in measuring global warming to describe unusual data, such as rising sea surface temperatures. The word travesty refers to what Trenberth sees as an inadequate observing system that, were it more adequate, would be able to track the warming he believes is there. In a statement on his NCAR webpage Trenberth states that, :\\"It is amazing to see this particular quote lambasted so often. It stems from a paper I published this year bemoaning our inability to effectively monitor the energy flows associated with short-term climate variability. It is quite clear from the paper that I was not questioning the link between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and warming, or even suggesting that recent temperatures are unusual in the context of short-term natural variability.\\" Code and documentation The CRU files also included programs written in Fortran, programmer comments and a readme file, which attracted considerable attention from programmers.Congress May Probe Leaked Global Warming E-Mails by Declan McCullagh, CBS News, 24 November 2009 The log covered more than four years work by a programmer, who had been frustrated by problems in relating climate data from numerous international sources. In a BBC Newsnight report, software engineer John Graham-Cumming said the code was \\"below the standard you'd expect in any commercial software\\" because it lacked clear documentation or an audit history. Graham-Cumming also reported finding a bug in the code's error handling which, if it occurred, would ignore data without warning. Myles Allen, head of the Climate Dynamics group at the University of Oxford, said that the code investigated by Newsnight had nothing at all to do with the HadCRUT temperature record used for climate reconstructions, which is maintained at the Met Office and not at CRU. When he challenged Newsnight on this, they responded that \\"Our expert's opinion is that this is climate change code\\" and declined to retract the story. He commented that on the same basis \\"the quality of the code I use to put together problems for our physics undergraduates shows that we should not trust results from my colleagues who work on the Large Hadron Collider on the grounds that \\"it is all physics code\\".\\" The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation established that the programming notes recorded the process of updating the CRU TS2.1 dataset product to TS3.0. This product includes multiple climate variables, including temperatures, rainfall and cloud cover, and has nothing to do with the HadCRUT temperature record which uses the separate CRUTEM land temperature dataset. The CRU programmer had the difficult task of merging datasets at the same time as migrating code to a new computer system, finding ways of dealing with inconsistencies in data from disparate organisations, improving quality control and debugging.

The extent of Annie's visibility to humans varies depending on her mood and her confidence. Annie's eyes turn blue when she is visible to humans, and violet when she is haunting. She always appears in the clothes she was wearing when she died, which change subtly depending on her state of mind. Annie's storylines have involved her coming to terms with her own death, avoiding death's door and being trapped in purgatory, in addition to several doomed attempts at romance. After losing Mitchell, the love of her life, and friends George and Nina, Annie becomes a mother figure to Eve (George and Nina's daughter) and new werewolf and vampire housemates, Tom and Hal respectively. Annie is written out of the show at the conclusion of series four in which--having made a difficult decision--she averts a dark future for mankind and is able to move on to the afterlife. Appearances The first series premiere (2009) establishes Annie as being unable to remember her death. She believes ex-fianc√© Owen's (Gregg Chillin) claims that she fell down the stairs accidentally. Annie frustrates George (Russell Tovey) because of her temperament and her tendency to constantly make tea she cannot drink, though Mitchell (Aidan Turner) is more sympathetic towards her. In the third episode, he introduces Annie to Gilbert (Alex Price), another ghost, who falls in love with her. When Owen arrives to clear a blocked pipe and produces a thong, Annie's memories of her death are triggered and shown in flashback. Owen had pushed her down the stairs after an argument; their relationship had been abusive, not the loving one she had imagined to be true. Memories of her death cause Annie to become a poltergeist able to move objects and turn machines on without touching them although she cannot control these abilities. To resolve her death Annie seeks a confession from Owen; he taunts her haunting effects as ineffectual and reveals that he was unfaithful throughout their relationship. Annie is inspired by her and George's rescue of Mitchell from a vampire coven and with their help stands up to Owen. After Owen has a mental breakdown and confesses, the Door to Death appears for Annie but she stays behind because her friends need her. In the final episode, a more confident Annie shows the ability to teleport further distances and greater powers of telekinesis, which she describes as \\"a whole new skill set.\\" In series two (2010), Annie has a greater physical presence due to her inner strength and happiness; she is seen by normal humans and able to get a job in a bar. However, after a flirtatious relationship with Saul (Alex Lanipekun) he attempts to assault her which leaves her distressed. Her employer Hugh (Nathan Wright) expresses his affection; Annie states she will wait until she feels ready to reciprocate. After Saul dies Annie is confronted by his spirit which attempts to drag her through the door of death. Though she escapes the trauma causes her to lose her physical presence, her job and the possibility of a relationship with Hugh. When George is dumped by Nina (Sinead Keenan), Annie encourages him out of his depression by enlisting his help in helping set Hugh up with his ex-girlfriend. After another brush with a malevolent spirit -- or Gatekeeper -- trying to take her through the door, Annie is taught defence skills by the ghost Sykes (Bryan Dick) including how to close these doors and read the auras of others. In the sixth episode of the series Annie encounters her mother Carmen (Jacquetta May) for the first time since her death, and with the aid of a psychic is able to tell her to move on. The series finale sees Annie sent through a Door to the other side by Kemp (Donald Sumpter). She manages to return briefly through another door, exacting revenge on Kemp and saving Nina's life by dragging the former to the other side with her. Following this second disappearance, she appears on George, Nina and Mitchell's television explaining her situation in the afterlife as 'complicated' and excessively bureaucratic. Series three (2011) begins with Mitchell entering purgatory and rescuing Annie from being sent to hell. Annie is overwhelmed with joy at being reunited with her friends, who have now relocated to Barry Island in south Wales, and in a closing monologue states that it was only after death that her life truly began. Overwhelmed with gratitude to Mitchell, Annie begins to fall for him and appoints herself as his guardian angel. Despite initial hostility Annie strikes up a friendship with the Type-4 'zombie' Sacha (Alexandra Roach) and is upset at her passing. Inspired by Sacha's message to 'seize the day' Annie confesses her romantic feelings towards Mitchell; he reciprocates and the pair kiss. Attempts by the pair to establish a sexual relationship are unsuccessful and Mitchell admits to Annie that he's content to have a non-physical relationship with her. Annie takes an interest when DS Nancy Reid (Erin Richards) visits the residence to investigate the Box Tunnel 20 massacre. Though distraught at realising the culprit is Mitchell, Annie goes as far as to kill a vampire attempting to kill Reid in a cover up and tells Mitchell that he has to face punishment. When Mitchell returns to ask George to kill him, he bids farewell to Annie with the words \\"You are the love of my long life\\", a sentiment she reciprocates. When Wyndham, a vampire 'Old One' arrives to announce a new age ruled by vampires he implies that Annie is a lot stronger than she imagines. In the fourth series premiere \\"Eve of the War\\" (2012) Annie is worried by George's paranoia and despondency following Nina‚Äôs murder. After sacrificing his life to save his daughter Eve -- whom it is prophesied will save the world -- he entrusts Annie and young werewolf Tom (Michael Socha) to look after her. Following on from this Annie and Tom receive a visit from the dying werewolf Leo (Louis Mahoney) and his housemates Pearl the ghost (Tamla Kari) and Hal the vampire (Damien Molony). After Annie helps Pearl admit her feelings for Leo the two depart for the afterlife together, leaving the vampire Hal dependent on Annie and Tom. From Pearl, Annie learns to \\"swaddle\\" baby Eve meaning both can leave the house undetected. When the sinister ghost Kirby (James Lance) is sent from the afterlife to kill the baby he splits the household up. Annie initially trusts his intent but he erodes her sense of purpose causing her to vanish. However Annie wills herself back and is able to kill Kirby's spirit by touch just as he has a knife over Eve's head. After helping new ghost Emrys (Anthony O'Donnell) pass on through his door after she accidentally killed him, Annie is contacted by the ghost of Eve's future self (Gina Bramhill) who asks Annie to accompany her into purgatory. Annie is shown a dystopian future where vampires rule supreme and humans and werewolves are rounded up in concentration camps and forced into dogfights. Eve reveals that in this alternate future Annie \\"faded\\" away after watching her remaining friends die. When Annie asks Eve what needs to be done to avert this future she is told that she needs to kill Eve as a baby. Annie at first resists this command, killing Nick Cutler (Andrew Gower) when he tried to kill Eve to bring down the vampires. However, after the vampire leader Mr Snow (Mark Gatiss) explains that Eve's survival will ensure that an effective resistance against the vampires will never form, Annie detonates a bomb killing Eve and the vampire Old Ones. Arriving in purgatory with baby Eve, Annie has a brief conversation with future Eve who fades away, the future having been averted. Annie enters another door where it is implied she will be reunited with George, Mitchell and Nina. Casting and characterisation Andrea Riseborough originally portrayed the character of Annie in the pilot episode of Being Human; when a full series was commissioned she was replaced with Lenora Crichlow. Although Crichlow initially felt the script was \\"a bit out there\\" she was won over by the story's grounding in real life. In her eyes, Annie is initially \\"quite insecure and vulnerable, and a little bit needy\\" but as the series progresses \\"she has to start to toughen up and prove herself\\". Crichlow explains that although originally it seemed like the other characters were responsible for Annie, \\"she is forced to move on and forced to grow up\\" as the series progresses. By the fourth series Annie‚Äôs \\"sense of duty and responsibility is what drives her\\" as she takes on a mothering role to both Eve and Tom. Actor Damien Molony explains how this is also replicated in Annie's relationship with Hal, who \\"absolutely looks up to her\\". Molony feels that Annie's subordination of tasks helps protects Hal from his own vampiric nature. The character was written out of the series at the end of the fourth series. In a video posted to the BBC's Being Human website Toby Whithouse explains that he felt the character had \\"come to a natural end\\". Crichlow was satisfied that the character went out saving the world and stated: \\"I don't know if there's much more for her to do, if I'm honest.\\" Robin Roberts is reflecting Annie's role as a female ghost. He describes Annie as a very important and strong female character. Throughout the series she helps numerous ghost to resolve their issues on Earth and to pass over in the Afterlife. Saul, a man whom Annie has been dating is unable to drag Annie into a door, she doesn't want to go. Furthermore, she is not only portrayed as physically strong but also emotionally, when she tells George to talk about his feelings after he and his girlfriend Nina have broken up. She tells him that depression is anger which is turned inward. Later the plot shows that Annie, and the \\"women's way of knowing is correct\\". In the series the female ghost is used \\"to model an alternative to patriarchal control and violence\\". According to Roberts fantasy TV series often promote superpowers as something that is used to \\"dominate and kill\\". Annie's role in the series shows a \\"feminist alternative\\". Throughout season four Annie's power grows even stronger. She is able to stop the evil vampires who try to destroy the world, and who have taken her adoptive daughter Eve. When she screams at them \\"Give me back my fucking baby\\", they all freeze. They are petrified by her power. According to Roberts Annie shows how a female power can develop into a super power.Robin Roberts: Being Human. The Female Ghost in Contemporary British and American Television.

February 18, 2011. Accessed 2011-08-14. Neela Debnath of The Independent feels that Annie works as a comic character through Crichlow's exploitation of her \\"pedantry and neurotic tendencies\\". Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffrey praised Annie's role in the fourth series remarking that \\"the perky ghost's continued presence helped to smooth the transition\\" between old and new regulars. He felt that retaining the character and using her in this fashion was \\"a canny move.\\" In a 2012 poll conducted by SFX Magazine to find the 100 sexiest female characters in science fiction and fantasy Annie was voted number sixty-two.

He does this by tricking his body into thinking that there is a full moon, granting him the strength needed to kill the vampires who threaten Eve.

Casting  Russell Tovey played George After the Being Human pilot, almost all the r√¥les were recast. Russell Tovey was the only regular cast member that stayed. He later told in an interview that the George that he played alongside Guy Flanagan (Mitchell - Pilot) and Andrea Riseborough (Annie - Pilot) was different from the George that he played alongside Lenora Crichlow and Aidan Turner, as each actor would respond differently to the character.  Leaving the series  In November 2011 Tovey announced on Twitter that he would leave Being Human. He later said that he would feel strange to film the series without Aidan Turner, who had announced his departure of the series a short time before Tovey. In 2016 at the MCM London Comic Con Russell Tovey said that he would like to film another one-off special of Being Human with his former co-stars Aidan Turner and Lenora Crichlow. He suggested that the special could take place in the after life.  Characterisation  Originally the BBC asked Whithouse to write a story about three college graduades buying a house together.

The Mandi Shivaratri fair is held as per Hindu calendar every year on the Krishna paksha 13th day/13th night (breaking fast/'vrata' on 14th after sunrise) of the waning moon in the month of Phalguna that corresponds to February/March as per Gregorian calendar. The festival‚Äôs popularity is widespread and hence is known as an international festival. In view of the large number of gods and goddesses that are invited to the festival from its 81 temples, Mandi town has the title of 'Varanasi of the Hills'. During 2016, the festival will be celebrated from 7 March (Shivaratri day) for seven days till 14 March 2016. The Mandi festival or fair is particularly famous as the special fair transforms Mandi town into a venue of grand celebration when all gods and goddesses, said to be more than 200 deities of the Mandi district assemble here, starting with the day of Shivaratri. Mandi town located on the banks of the Beas River, popularly known as the \\"cathedral of temples\\", is one of the oldest towns of Himachal Pradesh with about 81 temples of different gods and goddesses in its periphery. There are several legends linked to the celebration of this event. The festival is centred on the protector deity of Mandi \\"Mado Rai\\" (Lord Vishnu) and Lord Shiva of the Bhootnath temple in Mandi. History Mandi town, where the festival is held, was ruled by Raja Ajbar Sen who was considered the first great ruler of Mandi State in the sixteenth century, since he not only combined the hereditary regions but also added to it by conquering new areas. Apart from his palace, he built the temple of Bhootnath (temple for Shiva) at the centre of the Mandi town, which is one of the two focal temples of the festival. In the theocratic state that evolved during this period, worship of Shiva and related goddesses was dominant. However, the theocratic nature of the state received special emphasis when, during Raja Suraj Sen‚Äôs reign, Vishnu worship also became integral to the State. Raja Suraj Sen (1664 to 1679), who did not have an heir, built the temple known as \\"Madhav Rai temple\\", dedicated to a form of Lord Vishnu, as protector of Mandi. An elegant silver image of Radha and Krishna was made by his goldsmith Bhima, in the year 1705, which was named \\"Madho Rai\\" and deified, and ordained as the King of the State of Mandi thereafter. Since then the rulers served the state as servants of Madho Rai and custodians of the State. Suraj Sen‚Äôs successors have also held the deity of the temple in great reverence. This god is represented with precedence over all other gods on various religious occasions. The theocratic nature of the people of the state is amply reflected during the popular \\"Mandi Shivratri Fair\\", which is held every year with great fanfare. However, the specific observance of this festival as a fair, starting with Shivaratri, is linked to its ruler Ishwari Sen. Ishawri Sen was held a prisoner for 12 years after he lost his kingdom in the war waged by Sansar Chand of Punjab, in 1792. He was released by the Gurkha invaders who had invaded the Kangra and Mandi states. Afterwards, the Gurkhas' restored the Mandi state to Ishwari Sen. He was given a reception on the occasion of his return to Mandi, his state capital. On this occasion, the King invited all hill deities of the Kingdom and held a grand celebration, and this day happened to be the Shivratri festival day. Since then the practice of holding the Mandi fair during Shivaratri has been observed every year at Mandi. In recent years, modernity has also set in with Bollywood artists performing at the fair at Paddal in the celebrations in the evenings. Observance The observance of the fair is marked on the Shivaratri day when the village gods are carried in palanquins or rathas (chariots by people) to Mandi to pay homage to Madho Rai and the Raja. Members of caste denominations such as Brahmin and Kshatriya carry their gods and goddesses by palanquins or on their back. However, some exceptions of carrying them in vehicles by some caste groups have been noted. Thereafter, the fair lasts for seven days. It is an accepted practice that every deity that is brought to the festival (decorated with glittering embroidered drapery) visits Madho Rai temple first to pay obeisance to Lord Vishnu and then proceed to the palace in a colourful procession called the Shoba Yatra, known locally as 'Zareb,' to honour the ruler (the regent of the Lord Mado Rai). (It is said that Madho Rai comes out of his temple only once a year on the Shivaratri day and leads the procession.). The ruler thereafter pay obeisance to Lord Shiva at the Bhootnath temple where the main festival of Shivaratri is held. The palanquins of the deities are swayed to the drum beats and folk music to indicate their happiness after visiting the temples of Vishnu and Shiva. There is pecking order that is maintained in the sequence of worship by the deities invited to the fair, based on rank and status. The day after the Shivaratri, on the second day of the fair, a pageant of gods with folk bands, dancers and devotees (all dressed in their colourful attire) and with lot of fanfare, is held in Paddal, a large open ground at the confluence of the Beas and Suketi rivers. Some 200 deities arrive from shrines around Mandi town and are assigned places at the Paddal grounds as per the pecking order, where the devotees offer worship to all the deities. The pageant is held every day of the festival. The fair is also an occasion when local traders and people carry out brisk trade in local products such as wool, opium, honey, walnut, ghee (butter oil), and general merchandise from the region of Kangra, Kullu, Shimla, Bilaspur and from the neighbouring state of Punjab. It is said that the festivities promote handcrafted jewellery of the region. However, during the entire Mandi Shivaratri Fair, religiosity is the main theme. It is said that religious synthesis was achieved by combining the worship of Vishnu and Shiva cults during the seven-day fair. One day before the concluding day of the festival at the end of fanfare, music and dance, in the evening, Jagaran (\\"night vigil,\\" a nightlong worship) is held. On this occasion, a guru and his disciple proclaim prophesies for the following year. On the last day of the festivities, prayers are chanted and, after paying obeisance to Lord Shiva, all the deities assembled in Mandi depart to their original abodes. On this occasion, chadars (a form of devotional drapery offering to the god) are offered. It is an occasion when the head of the state (now a governor) is normally present on the last day, joins the worship, and accompanies the pageant. During all these festivities, it is said that Rishi Kamru Nag (local god of rains), the presiding deity of the Maha Shivaratri, after paying his obeisance to Madho Rai, moves to the Tarna ma temple at the top of the Tarna hill from where he watches the proceedings of the fair for seven days. People from all walks of life and belonging to all strata of the society from adjoining areas come to visit this fair and to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva on this auspicious day. ;Bhootnath Temple Bhootnath Temple, with an idol of a manifestation of god Shiva, an ancient temple dated to the 1520s, is synonymous with Mandi. It is in the heart of the town. The Nandi, Shiva's mount, faces the deity from the ornamented double-arched entrance. The festival of Shivaratri is the prime event at this temple; the temple is the focal point of the seven day festival. A legend is told of the building of Bhoothnath Temple. It is said that, in 1526, Raja Ajber Sen heard the story of a cow offering milk on her own volition to a particular stone in a forest in Mandi. Lord Shiva is said to have appeared in the Raja‚Äôs dream and directed him to extricate the Shiva Linga that was buried at that site. Thereafter, the Raja found the Shiva Linga at the indicated location, which he deified in a temple that he erected in 1526, at the place it was found. He called it the \\"Bhootnath Temple\\" and started the observance of the Shivaratri festival at Mandi. Concurrent with this event, the Raja shifted his capital from Bhiuli to Mandi. Visitor information Mandi town is accessible by road from Shimla, Chandigarh, Pathankot and Delhi. The nearest railway stations are Joginder Nagar and Shimla by narrow gauge train. It is connected to Chandigarh and Kalka by broad gauge line of the Indian Railways. Kullu-Manali airport Bhuntar is the nearest airport, it is about 45 km from Mandi town.

After he has been running away from being a vampire for such a long time, Annie looks after him, which he needs.  Casting  Aidan Turner played Mitchell Guy Flanagan was cast as Mitchell in the Being Human Pilot. The pilot was broadcast in 2008. When Andrea Riseborough announced that she wouldn't be available for an upcoming series of Being Human, the producers had to do a recasting. This way also the dynamic of the main characters would change, which made the production crew rethink their previous casting choices. Creator Toby Whithouse later said that the pilot vampires were a ‚Äúbit to Anne Rice‚Äù for his liking. So it was decided to change the actors of the pilot's vampires, including Mitchell. Actor Gregg Chillin read for Mitchell but was later cast as Owen. When Aidan Turner got a call from his agent about auditioning for a new drama Being Human, Turner's initial reaction was to turn the offer down. He didn't know what to make of the show's concept, which sounded bizarre to him. As soon as he got the script, Turners opinion of the show changed. He auditioned for the role and got it a few time later. The changing of the actor of Mitchell changed not only the personality of Mitchell, but also of the characters around him. Russell Tovey said in an interview that the George that he played alongside Guy Flanagan (Mitchell - Pilot) and Andrea Riseborough (Annie - Pilot) was different from the George that he played alongside Lenora Crichlow and Aidan Turner, because each actor would respond differently to the character.  Leaving the series  When Aidan Turner got offered a role in the movie series The Hobbit as K√≠li he decided to leave the series. The production team could not contract actors for more than one season and had to renegotiate with the actors after each series. So creator Toby Whithouse knew before that at some point Aidan Turner would leave the series. To prepare for this Whithouse wrote a sequence in series two where Aidan's character Mitchell would kill many innocent people in a train. Whithouse knew that would be the reason why the character would have to leave, whether it would happen at the end of series three or later. The script of the series had three different possible endings. One of them was that Mitchell gets back to Bolivia with the other vampires. Aidan Turner however thought it was appropriate for the Mitchell's ending that he would be killed and so it was filmed this way. If Aidan would return in some point during the next series Mitchell would only be seen in flashbacks. When Mitchell would have stayed in the series, one possible story would have been that Mitchell would have become the main villain in series four. In 2016 at the MCM London Comic Con Turner said that he is up for another one-off special of Being Human with his former co-stars Russell Tovey and Lenora Crichlow.  Characterization  Originally the BBC asked Whithouse to write a story about three college graduates buying a house together. In Whithouse's early ideas John Mitchell was a sex-addicted man. He was working in a call centre and had a string of opportunist relationships.Inhuman Nature. in: SFX, The 50 Greatest Vampires of All Time (2011), P. 54-60 In the end Mitchell turned out to be a vampire who has difficulties controlling his bloodlust. According to Mark Oakley Mitchell is scared of the creature within him but can't prevent him from coming out from time to time. After having killed many people since he had become a vampire, Mitchell does not want to harm anymore. The guilt of his deeds has just become too much for him. According to Monica German√† Mitchell's addiction to blood shows similarities to alcohol addiction. Sometimes Mitchell believes he has a choice, whether he kills or not. For example, when he tells his infector Herrick, that he doesn't want to join the vampire community because he chooses humans. Other times he has doubts about the existence of a free will when he claims to have no choice. Then his killings are justified by an \\"overwhelming need\\". Whenever Mitchell tries to stop killing people or drinking blood, it is motivated by the idea of love. His \\"self-conciousness about his emotions and questions of ethical responsibility that construct him as a moral animal.\\"Monica German√†: Being Human. Twenty-First-Century Monsters. In: Justin D. Edwards, Agnieszka Soltysik Monnet: The Gothic in Contemporary Literature and Popular Culture: Pop Goth. Routledge, 2012. P. 57-71 Alessandra Stanly describes Mitchell as charming and handsome. He has no trouble attracting women. Reception Even though Guy Flanagan got replaced by Aidan Turner after the Pilot, both actors were praised for their portrayal.  Guy Flanagan (Pilot)  Vanessa Randolph from Fruitless Pursuits enjoyed Guy Flanagan's performance as Mitchell. According to her Guy ‚Äúbrought an otherworldly quality to Mitchell‚Äù that she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt see being replicated, an ‚Äòoldness‚Äô and romance associated with vampires.‚Äù When she heard that Flanagan would leave the show, she was devastated. Matt from thecustardtv.com praises the three distinctive leads with their own unique moral dilemma. He describes Guy Flanagan‚Äôs Mitchell as a ‚Äúlaconic, icy vampire who is eaten up with blood- curdling guilt‚Äù when he kills humans, drinking their blood. Werewolf- Movies.com believes that Mitchell is \\"a cool-as-ice vampire\\". Diana Kingston- Gabai thinks Guy Flanagan as Mitchell plays his role very well. She loved Flanagan's ‚Äúmore sardonic, constantly-bemused performance and his chemistry with the co-stars‚Äù and was sad that he was replaced with Aidan Turner. Daniel Martin from The Guardian thinks that Guy Flanagan's Mitchell was too stylised and too vampiric. So he believes it is good that he got replaced by Aidan Turner. Andrew Smith believes that Guy Flanagan's Mitchell is much cooler and quieter than Aiden Turner's which turns Mitchell more into a stoner than a brooding heartthrob.  Aidan Turner  Hollywood.com thinks that Mitchell ‚Äúchannels his inner-rock-god as the guy you know you shouldn‚Äôt like but you do.‚Äù. Mark Oakley from Den of Geek said that by playing Mitchell Aidan Turner shows what an awesome actor he is ‚Äúadding dramatic weight, a credible romantic interest and a smattering of leading man about him when necessary.\\" Brent Hartinger from Logo TV feels that Aidan Turner as Mitchell is \\"very easy on the eyes\\". According to Robert Moore from PopMatters Mitchell is the most compelling character of the show and should be ranked within the \\"shortest of short lists of great TV vampires\\". Robert Moore thinks Mitchell is a fascinating character in the same league as Joss Whedon's Spike or Angel. Mitchell committed unspeakable horrors which forces the viewers to think about whether Mitchell is beyond redemption and if he could be anything else besides inhumanly cruel, even if he wants to change. Moore loves that the series, unlike many others, doesn't give an easy answer to this question. In 2011 and 2012 Aidan Turner was nominated as best actor and sexiest male for playing John Mitchell by the SFX magazine.SFX Magazine (2011): SFX Sci-Fi Awards 2011. Edition: April 2011.

Page:93-97 In 2009 Mitchell was listed on place 21 of SFX's Top Vampires of all Time list, in front of such characters as Barnabas Collins, Eric Northman or Louis de Pointe du Lac. According to SFX Mitchell is \\"another in a long line in conflicted vampires\\", however his optimism sets him apart. While the other vampires mope he smiles and tries to make the best of things.21 Mitchell. in: SFX, The 50 Greatest Vampires of All Time (2011), P. 20 In 2011 Mitchell was listed on place 60 of SFX's Top Sci-Fi Icons list, in front of such characters as Ron Weasley, Sam Winchester, Rory Williams, Xena, Sookie Stackhouse or Gandalf.Lewin, Russell: Mitchell.

Ni√±o is the first Catholic school built in the fast-growing Las Villas de Sto. Nino Subdivision. This subdivision is located in the midst of four barrios (towns) of Meycauayan, Bulacan, in the Philippines, namely Iba, Pantoc, Camalig and Perez. In September 1983, the developer of the subdivision, Mrs. Geronima Que, invited Sister Maria Virginia Banez, Religious of the Virgin Mary (RVM), her former schoolmate, to build a school in the heart of Las Villas de Sto. Ni√±o. The RVM congregation responded to this invitation and with the approval of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) erected a school on the hectare of land donated by Mrs. Geronima Que. The RVM congregation in turn bought another one and a half hectares to give more space for expansion. On October 14 and 25, 1983, the MECS regional office granted approval to operate the new school. Construction Construction started in November 1983. Sister Maria Virginia Banez, RVM, took charge of over-seeing the work and the needs of the school while Sister Maria Aurora Sartin, RVM, worked for the approval of the application to operate both High School and Elementary courses. These permissions were granted temporarily on June 11, 1984. The RVM sisters of St. Mary's Academy of Meycauayan Saluysoy, took charge of preparing the school for the opening. Enrolment was done in Saluysoy while the construction was going on in Sto. Nino. Sister Maria Pureza Romano, RVM, and Sis. Maria Eleonor Alpino, RVM, helped in the organization of classes, until Sis. Ma. Pilar Jorge, RVM, arrived in July 1984. She then became the first Principal of St. Mary's Academy of Sto. Nino and at the same time the superior of the community of the RVM sisters. Expansion Due to the increase in population of the school, the administration felt there was a need to construct another building to accommodate the students. With the help of Rev. Mother General and her council, a three-story building with 18 classrooms was built in 1992. In 1993, the convertible stage and canteen were constructed. Between 1997 and 2000, additional school facilities were constructed, such as the CAT headquarters, Guard House, MIC Office, Prayer Room, Computer Laboratory, covered walkway, and the Multi-purpose Kiosks. To serve the students better, the administration began the construction of the Audi-gym and the provision of the Audio-Visual Room and Science Laboratory Room in the year 2001. Since then, SMASN has continually improved its service facilities. During the year 2004‚Äì2005, a new Speech Laboratory was set up, equipped with modern gadgets and ten internet stations for both departments. To improve the water supply, the school has constructed an 800-ft deep well. In April 2004, the construction of a four- storey grade school building was started and this was blessed on February 8, 2005 by His Excellency, Most Rev. Jose Oliveros, D.D., Bishop of Malolos. Immediately after the pupils had transferred to the new building, the renovation of the old building for the different service facilities started. These included the guidance office, AVR, IMC, Health Center, Viewing Room, Dubbing room, Internet Laboratory and Canteen. Through the initiative of the officers of SMASN Supreme Family Council, a covered walkway from the old grade school building to the Audi-Gym was constructed. In SY 2005‚Äì2007, the renovation of the High School building for the different offices, Science Laboratory, NTP lounge, Encoding room, TLE Laboratory and Model House was done. Construction was completed with the improvement of the Guest House and the construction of the school Chapel.

Historically, it has been part of the anti-nuclear movement in the United States.New England Coalition. The NEC is primarily concerned with legal action more than protests. It was involved in both legal action and protests about the Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Plant prior to its shut down in 1992, and was involved in legal action and protests over extending the license to operate at the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant. Since 2014 it has been working towards requiring the owners of Vermont Yankee to implement a hardened underground storage system for their highly radioactive nuclear waste by legal interventions through the Vermont Public Service Board. Actions New England Coalition Actions include the following: * Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Seabrook The NEC began legal work on the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant in 1973 with legal arguments that it was not safely sited, designed, or built. Additionally the NEC presented testimony that was not economically needed. In 1990, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) waved its own rules on emergency planning at Seabrook, an action that seemed to indicate the lessons of Three Mile Island had not been learned. The New England Coalition took legal action appealing to the Supreme Court. The appeal was denied. * Vermont Yankee The NEC participated as a full party in the United States government licensing procedures for the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant (VY). The NEC also has undertaken repeated interventions before the NRC, in 1977 and 1987, to challenge increases in the amount of nuclear waste stored at VY. In 1999, the NEC intervened in the sale of VY to Amergen. This intervention was successful. In 2002, the NEC intervened to set conditions on the sale of VY to Entergy. This intervention made possible a subsequent intervention on the power uprate at the plant, which took place before both houses of the Vermont legislature. Starting in 2008, the NEC has been intervening to prevent the relicensing of VY. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as of April, 2010, the licensing process has set a record for being the longest in history, with credit due to the New England Coalition. The specific action causing the delay was the NEC contention that the mathematics associated with managing the aging plant were defective.\\"Yankee relicense sets new record\\" Brattleboro Reformer, April 19, 2010. * Yankee Rowe The NEC joined the Union of Concerned Scientists in an effort to shut down the Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Plant. The plant was closed in 1992. * Actions before the Vermont Legislature The NEC helped write Vermont's Act 296, a law covering radioactive waste disposal. Current action As a result of the tritium leak at VY, on February 9, 2010, the NEC filed a 10 CFR 2.206 Enforcement Petition requesting that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) undertake enforcement actions in response to a series of problems including:\\"NEC asks NRC to close VY\\" Brattleboro Reformer, February 10, 2010. * Growing concentrations of radioactive material in the groundwater and soil at VY, * Entergy's failure to understand and know VY's design, layout, and construction, * An inadequate plan for managing aging underground pipes at the plant, and * The NRC's failure to realize there was a problem until it was self-revealed. The NRC was asked to perform various actions including the following: * Put VY into cold shutdown to stop or slow the leak and isolate it, * Require that VY re-establish its licensing basis, * Determine why Entergy was allowed to operate VY without adequate knowledge of its systems, * Undertake a full Diagnostic Evaluation Team Inspection (the equivalent of an Independent Safety Assessment conducted at Maine Yankee), and * Require that Entergy change its License Renewal to address aging analysis and include aging management for all piping that might carry radionuclides.

The film was directed by Edgar G. Ulmer and Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia. It marks the first film pairing of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. Plot The film begins with the Roman Senate hearing about Hannibal (Victor Mature) crossing the Alps with his men and many elephants. The crossing is difficult, with many men dying en route, but they manage to pass through, in part because Hannibal forms an allegiance with a local chieftain. Hannibal's troops capture Sylvia, niece of Roman senator Fabius Maximus, and she and Hannibal fall in love. Some of Hannibal's troops oppose the match and an unsuccessful attempt is made on Sylvia's life. Hannibal also loses an eye during battle. Despite the warnings of Fabius, who suggests avoiding battle and waging a campaign of exhaustion, the decision is made to fight Hannibal out in the open. The consequence is a massive Roman defeat at Cannae. Fabius is recalled to lead the Roman Army and the momentum of Hannibal's campaign begins to wane. His wife and child arrive from Carthage. Sylvia returns to Rome and commits suicide. A postscript informs us that Hannibal fought on for many more years in other lands.

Victor Mature signed to make the film with Liber Films of Rome in March 1959. Filming took place in October of that year with a reported budget of $2.5 million. Edgar Ulmer was the American representative of the company. The only English speaking actors in the film were Victor Mature and Rita Gam, all the other actors were Italian and had their lines dubbed into English. The film featured approximately 20,000 extras. The film was originally intended to be a more personal account of Hannibal's life, but the studio instead pressured the film makers into developing a more standard historical film. The film was directed by Edgar G. Ulmer, although IMDB lists Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia as a co-director. The film was released theatrically in the USA on 18 June 1960. The film existed in two versions, a 95-minute version released in non-English speaking European countries, and a 103-minute version released in the US and other English speaking territories. The films tagline was \\"Jump on! Hang on! Here comes the avenging Hannibal and his crazed elephant army!\\" The film's music was composed by Carlo Rustichelli. Release Hannibal was released in Italy on 21 December 1959 and in the United States on 18 June 1960. DVD release The film was released on DVD in the USA on October 19, 2004. The DVD includes 16:9 format, a 33-minute interview with Edgar G. Ulmer, a photo and poster gallery, the theatrical trailer, and cast and crew biographies. The DVD contains no subtitles.

The Church is part of the Archdiocese of Changanacherry. It was established in 1927. That year a cross was erected on Mannilakunnu - ‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥ø‡¥≤‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡µç (a small hill area around 10 km from Changanachery) by Fr. Karingida Thomma with the help of members of Marthoma Dasa Sangham, a Christian youth organisation. This was the beginning of The Holy Family Church Mannila. Through co-operative effort, an official church was constructed in 1940. Construction of the present church, on the site of the old church, began 51 years later and was completed in 1995. Marthoma Dasa Sangham played an important role in the formation of Mannila church. The organisation was founded by H. E. Mar Thomas Kurialassery in 1919. Mar Thomas Kurialassery arranged training for Marthoma Dasa Sangham members at Parel minor seminary, Changanacherry. Rev Fr. Dominic Thottassery was the first president of Marthoma Dasa Sangham. They conducted prayers in remote areas and taught catechism to the people in Mannila, which created a holy atmosphere at Mannilakunnu.  History  Mar Thomas Kurialassery became the Bishop of Changanacherry Diocese in 1911. He selected a group of young people to conduct prayers in remote areas and teach catechism to the people. They conducted prayers in places where there were no churches. Mar Thomas Kurialassery also made a by-law for their activities and named them as \\"Marthommadasasangham - ‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡µº‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡µã‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡¥¶‡¥æ‡¥∏‡¥∏‡¥Ç‡¥ò‡¥Ç\\". He also arranged training for \\"Marthommadasasangham\\" members at Parel minor Seminary Changanacherry. Fr.Dominic Thottassery was the first president of Marthommadasasangham. Thrikodithanam, Mannila, Kurumpanadam and Payipadu were the main functional areas. Changanacherry Cathedral Church and Kurumpanadam church were the main centres of Marthommadasasangham at that time. Karingida Thomma became the vicar of Kurumpanadam church. He assembled a group of people and moved to Mannilakunnu through the forest road via Parakada. There he erected a cross with the help of Marthommadasasangham members. Many people gathered at Mannilakunnu and prayed there. A shed was erected and Palakunnel Ninan Saviour donated a model of the Holy Family that was placed inside. Prayers began in Mannilakunnu every Wednesday. People from remote areas, including Kuttanadu, came to Mannilakunnu to conduct prayers. They gave money to the Holy Family as \\"Nercha\\". Marthommadasasangham gave money to the Kurumpanadam church for mission works. After it was built, the shed was under the control of Marthommadasasangham. The Changanacherry revenue officers gave the land to Marthommadasasangham as \\"Danapathippu\\". Marthommadasasangham paid the tax for the land. Kalyamkandam Thommachen, K.J Joseph Kochukalayamkandam, Muriyankavunkal Joseph Sir, Moolayil Cheriyachen, Moolayil Kunjachen, Thyparampil Chacko Sir, Koovakattu Thommachy, Kuttuvelil Kunjappen were thr prominent members of the Marthommadasasangham during that time. In 1940, Thackenkery Varghese became vicar. The shed at Mannilakunnu was replaced and a new church was built. Palakunnel Ninan Saviour gave a \\"Althara\\" to Mannila church. When Kocheri Cyriac became vicar, he started holding Mass at Mannilakunnu every Sunday. In 1972, then Archbishop of Changanacherry, Mar Antony Padiyara declared Mannila a Independent Church. Mathew Kallukalam became the first vicar of Mannila Holy Family Church. At that time a youth organisation called Mannila Youth Organisation was developed in Mannila. In 1982 a parish hall was built, while Mathew Kiliroor was vicar. On 21 June 1982 an ASMI convent was established. On 10 February 1991, the foundation stone for the new church was laid at Mannila by Archbishop Mar Joseph Powathil. On 5 November 1995 the new church was blessed by Powathil, while Joseph Vaniyapurakkal was vicar. As of 2014 Thomas Thekkekara was vicar.

During the Iraq War it was known as Iraq's largest \\"Special Group\\" (the Americans' term for Iran-backed Shia paramilitaries in Iraq), and is now part of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a group of Shi‚Äôite militias that are close to Iran. AAH was funded and trained by Iran's Quds Force.Controlled by Iran, the deadly militia recruiting Iraq's men to die in Syria, The Guardian, 12 March 2014 Members of AAH, as part of PMF, receive Iraqi government salaries after the PMF units were officially integrated into Iraqi security forces in 2018. AAH has claimed responsibility for over 6,000 attacks on American and Coalition forces. In 2017, AAH created a party with the same name. On 3 January 2020, the United States Department of State announced its intent to designate AAH a terrorist organization along with two of its leaders, Qais al- Khazali and his brother Laith al-Khazali, who were designated Specially Designated Global Terrorists. History Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq split from the Sadrist Movement in 2004. Qais al-Khazali split from Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army after the Shi'a uprising in 2004 to create his own Khazali network. When the Mahdi Army signed a cease-fire with the government and the Americans and the fighting stopped, Khazali continued fighting, and during the battle Khazali was already issuing his own orders to militiamen without Muqtada al- Sadr's approval. The group's leadership (which includes Khazali, Abd al-Hadi al-Darraji (a politician in Muqtada al-Sadr's Sadr Movement) and Akram al- Kaabi), however, reconciled with al-Sadr in mid-2005. In July 2006, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq was founded and became one of the Special Groups which operated more independently from the rest of the Mahdi Army. It became a completely independent organisation after the Mahdi Army's disbanding after the 2008 Shi'a uprising. In July 2006, A part of AAH fought alongside Hezbollah in 2006 Lebanon War against Israel. In November 2008 when Sadr created the Promised Day Brigade to succeed the Mahdi Army, he asked AAH (and other Special Groups) to join, but they declined. AAH has claimed responsibility for over 6,000 attacks in Iraq including the October 10, 2006 attack on Camp Falcon, the assassination of the American military commander in Najaf, the May 6, 2006 downing of a British Lynx helicopter and the October 3, 2007 attack on the Polish ambassador. Their most known attack, however, is the January 20, 2007 Karbala provincial headquarters raid where they infiltrated the U.S. Army's offices at Karbala, killed one soldier, then abducted and killed four more American soldiers. After the raid, the U.S. military launched a crackdown on AAH and the raid's mastermind Azhar al-Dulaimi was killed in Baghdad, while much of the group's leadership including the brothers Qais and Laith al- Khazali and Lebanese Hezbollah member Ali Musa Daqduq who was Khazali's advisor was in charge of their relations with Hezbollah. After these arrests in 2007, Akram al-Kaabi, who had been the military commander of the Mahdi Army until May 2007, led the organisation. In May 2007, AAH kidnapped British IT expert Peter Moore and his four bodyguards. They demanded the release of all their fighters being imprisoned by the Iraqi authorities and US military in return for his release. His four bodyguards were killed, but Moore himself was released when AAH's leader Qais al-Khazali was released in January 2010. Prior to Qazali's release, security forces had already released over 100 of the group's members including Laith al-Khazali. In 2008 many of the groups fighters and leaders fled to Iran after the Iraqi Army was allowed to re-take control of Sadr City and the Mahdi Army was disbanded. Here most fighters were re-trained in new tactics. It resulted in a major lull in the group's activity from May to July 2008. In February 2010, AAH kidnapped DoD civilian Issa T. Salomi, a naturalized American from Iraq. This was the first high-profile kidnapping of a foreigner in Iraq since the kidnapping of Peter Moore (which was also done by AAH). Salomi was released in March 2010 in return for the release of four AAH fighters being held in Iraqi custody. In total 450 members of AAH have been handed over from US to Iraqi custody since the kidnapping of Peter Moore, over 250 of which have been released by the Iraqi authorities.The Washington Post U.S. failure to neutralize Shiite militia in Iraq threatens to snarl pullout On July 21, 2010 General Ray Odierno said Iran was supporting three Shiite extremist groups in Iraq that had been attempting to attack US bases. One of the groups was AAH and the other two were the Promised Day Brigade and Ketaib Hezbollah. In December 2010 it was reported that notorious Shi'a militia commanders such as Abu Deraa and Mustafa al-Sheibani were returning from Iran to work with AAH. Iranian Grand Ayatollah Kazem al-Haeri was identified as the group's spiritual leader. In August and September 2012, AAH started a poster campaign in which they distributed over 20,000 posters of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei throughout Iraq. A senior official in Baghdad's local government said municipal workers were afraid to take the posters down in fear of retribution by AAH militiamen.Yahoo News Iran ayatollah is poster boy for influence in Iraq, September 25, 2012 Iraq protests, 2018‚Äìpresent In late 2018, protests in Basra, Iraq saw several Iran-related organizations being targeted. Among the damage caused by protesters were several AAH offices which were set on fire. In July 2019, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs, Joan Polaschik, stated ‚Äúrogue‚Äù Iranian-backed militias were planning operations that could kill Americans, coalition partners and Iraqis and U.S. diplomatic facilities and continue to conduct indirect fire attacks. The U.S. removed non-emergency staff from its embassy in Baghdad and closed its consulate in Basra. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, Michael Mulroy, said that Iran's ‚Äúcynical interference‚Äù undermines Iraqi interests by supporting to non-compliant militias, more loyal to Tehran than Baghdad, undermining the Iraqi prime minister's authority, preying on ordinary Iraqis by crime and destabilizing the fragile communities liberated from ISIS. In October 2019, AAH militia opened fire on protesters trying to set fire to the group's office in Nasiriya, killing at least nine protesters. On 3 January 2020, the United States Department of State announced its intent to designate AAH a terrorist organization along with two of its leaders. Qais al-Khazali and his brother Laith al-Khazali were designated Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Syrian Civil War AAH's Syrian branch is called the Haidar al- Karar Brigades, and led by Akram al-Kaabi, AAH's military leader stationed in Aleppo. al-Kaabi is also the founder and leader of the militant group Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba. The group initially fought under the banner of al-Abbas Brigade (a mixed Syrian, Iraqi and Lebanese Shia organization), but split in 2014 following a dispute with al-Abbas's native Syrian fighters. Like other Iraqi Shia paramilitaries in Syria, they fight in defense of the Sayyidah Zainab shrine. Iraq elections AAH took part in the 2014 Iraqi parliamentary election as part of the Al-Sadiqoun Bloc. An electoral meeting of estimated 100,000 supporters of Al-Sadiqoun was marred by violence as a series of bombs exploded at the campaign rally held at the Industrial Stadium in eastern Baghdad killing at least 37 people and wounding scores others, according to Iraqi police. The group organizers had planned to announce at the rally the names of its candidates for the parliamentary election. At the election, the Al-Sadiquun Bloc won just one seat out of 328 seats in the Iraqi Parliament. AAH took part in the 2018 Iraqi parliamentary election as part of the Fatah Alliance.

The group is alleged to receive some $5 million worth of cash and weapons every month from Iran. In January 2012, following the American withdrawal from Iraq in December 2011, Qais al- Khazali declared the United States was defeated and that now the group was prepared to disarm and join the political process.Iraq Shi‚Äôite militia says U.S. has ‚Äòfailed,‚Äô pledges to lay down arms in wake of Sunni bombings, National Post, January 5, 2012 Since the beginning of the Iraqi war against ISIL, AAH has grown to around 10,000 members and been described as one of if not the most powerful members of the Popular Mobilization Forces. It has recruited hundreds of Sunni fighters to fight against ISIS. Funding The group alleged receives training and weapons from Iran's Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force as well as Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. By March 2007, Iran was providing the network between $750,000 and $3 million in arms and financial support each month. Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani, a former Badr Brigades member who ran an important smuggling network known as the Sheibani Network played a key role in supplying the group.

On April 8, 2002, Krone was released from prison after DNA evidence proved that he did not murder the victim, and also identified the real killer: Kenneth Phillips, a repeatedly violent sexual offender.

It was founded in June 1964 by bandurist Hryhory Bazhul and since May 1971 was directed by Peter Deriashnyj. Origins At the end of World War II, bandurist Hryhory Bazhul emigrated to Sydney, Australia where he continued to perform for the Ukrainian community. Having had performing success in a number of bandura ensembles in Germany during the post-war years (1944‚Äì49), he was keen to establish a similar ensemble in Sydney where he had settled on completion of his immigrant contract.Bazhul, H. \\"–ê–ª—å—Ñ–∞ —ñ –æ–º–µ“ë–∞ –º–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ü—å–∫–æ—ó –æ–¥–∏–Ω–∏—Ü—ñ –≤ –°—ñ–¥–Ω–µ—ó\\", –í—ñ–ª—å–Ω–∞ –î—É–º–∫–∞ 13.VI.1982 In 1952, Bazhul advertised in The Free Thought Ukrainian-language newspaper in an attempt to locate like-minded individuals.

To mark the 100th anniversary of Taras Shevchenko death the group gave a series of concerts in Sydney and Melbourne and also produced a recording of four songs from their repertoire. By 1963, after some 39 rehearsals (2‚Äì3 per month), five individuals of adult age and various levels of musical and vocal ability worked diligently to create a 17-song repertoire. This group had to overcome numerous difficulties related to the establishment of a bandurist ensemble in Australia, such as: manufacturing instruments; the procurement of suitable strings; tuning pegs and tuning keys. All these posed insurmountable problems. The development of repertoire was also an obstacle since no one in the group had suitable experience in arranging vocal works, as was the problem of duplication of musical scores. Repertoire collected by Bazhul from various sources was initially used and gradually all the other problems were overcome by sheer effort, which testifies to the tenacity of this ensemble and its founder. Then unexpectedly personal difficulties saw some of the members leave and now finding itself vocally incomplete the quintet ceased its activities in February 1964.

The attrition rate however for the young inductees was high since there was no peer group to take encouragement and inspiration from.–ú—ñ—à–∞–ª–æ–≤ –í. - –ö–æ–±–∑–∞—Ä—Å—å–∫–∞ —Å–ø–∞–¥—â–∏–Ω–∞ –ì–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –•–æ—Ç–∫–µ–≤–∏—á–∞ —É –¥—ñ–∞—Å–ø–æ—Ä—ñ // –¢—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü—ñ—ó —ñ —Å—É—á–∞—Å–Ω–µ –≤ —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫—ñ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ñ /–¢–µ–∑–∏ –¥–æ–ø–æ–≤—ñ–¥–µ–π –ú—ñ–∂–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ—ó –Ω–∞—É–∫–æ–≤–æ-–ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ—ó –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü—ñ—ó, –ø—Ä–∏—Å–≤—è—á–µ–Ω–æ—ó 125-—Ä—ñ—á—á—é –ì–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –•–æ—Ç–∫–µ–≤–∏—á–∞/ X.: 2002. - –°.97‚Äì98 With the support of the Ukrainian Scouting movement and the conductor of the Ukrainian Choir Boyan - Vasyl Matiash, young scouts began to learn to play the instrument privately and a new generation of bandurists formed the Khotkevych Ensemble. In time the small group made numerous independent performances and also on many occasions accompanied the Boyan Choir under the direction of Vasyl Matiash. The new youth ensemble also included female participants. By 1970 some 19 students had embarked on learning the art, however a core group of some seven students remained and became known as the Hnat Khotkevych Bandurist Ensemble. They became the backbone of the Ensemble for the next few years. Hnat Khotkevych had taught Hryhory Bazhul to play the Kharkiv style bandura in the Ukraine, and as a mark of respect Bazhul chose to give this new ensemble Khotkevych's name. As the group's popularity grew, the Ensemble became the moving force for the development of bandura art in Australia. It became evident that a formal school for learning bandura art in a central location with easy access to public transport needed to be established. Up until 1968 most new students were taught privately by Hryhory Bazhul at his residence in Fairfield West. New direction After moving to Sydney from Newcastle in 1966, Peter Deriashnyj contacted Hryhory Bazhul in July 1967 to pursue studies with the bandura, specifically the Kharkiv style of bandura. The Hnat Khotkevych bandurist ensemble under the direction of P. Deriashnyj - Melbourne, 1971. Deriashnyj joined Bazhul's small group of 5 bandurists in November 1967 and encouraged the existing members to include vocal study into the weekly practice routine. H. Bazhul supported this proposal and elevated him to concertmaster. His first act was to bring all instruments to a concert standard by the renewal of old or rusting strings and repairing of cracked instruments. Throughout 1968 the group worked diligently at combining 4 part vocals accompanied to their own bandura playing. A specific concert repertoire was selected and new bandura parts were written with a mind to the development of vocal and instrumental skills. Their first independent concert took place in March 1969 in Wollongong, and was dedicated to the Ukrainian bard Taras Shevchenko. This concert was later repeated in Sydney. The new repertoire including the vocal performance of the Ensemble had an effect on the young Ukrainians in the audience and under Deriashnyj's direction the group attracted talented individuals and continued to expand its repertoire and playing technique. Challenging 4 part (SATB) choral vocals accompanied by 4 bandura parts - 1st and 2nd Kharkiv banduras and 1st and 2nd Chernihiv banduras became the norm. From 1970 the ensemble toured the eastern states in Australia continually performing at community functions, historic anniversaries and numerous folkloric and ethnic festivals throughout Australia. In March 1971, ten bandurists with bassist Oless Tindyk gave an important concert in Newcastle dedicated to the bard Taras Shevchenko. At this concert a men's group and a women's group each performed 3 songs from their new repertoire as well as combining for the full ensemble performance - 14 items. The one negative issue to be exposed was a serious disagreement between the performing members as to who had voting rights in financial or performance matters. Of the many festivals the ensemble took part in, the most renowned was the Shell National Folkloric Festival held in the Sydney Opera House - from approx. 1976 to late 1980s when eventually the festival ceased activities. the Ensemble's performances at the National Folkloric Festival were enhanced by the participation of its inter-state members. In 1972, with donations received from caroling during the Christmas period and from individuals throughout Australia, Deriashnyj established the Sydney School of Bandura which was located at the Ukrainian Central School in Lidcombe. The funds were used to buy 3 or 4 banduras which were then used to introduce the 10- to 15-year-old generation to the art of bandura. Students of the School of Bandura were able to study in both the Kharkiv style and the Chernihiv style however, since Kharkiv banduras were difficult to obtain and more expensive to produce, the more plentiful and relatively inexpensive Chernihiv type banduras began to predominate. The Sydney School of Bandura however was the only one in the diaspora to teach and propagate the Kharkiv style. With due consideration for his state of health, Bazhul transferred the leadership of the Ensemble to bandurist Peter Deriashnyj in May 1971. This change did not sit well with some of the bandurists that were still wrestling with membership voting issues, let alone accept a new leader, the result being that the Ensemble lost four experienced members in that year. The new Ensemble, showing so much promise found itself vocally incomplete‚Äîat this crossroad, the previous group ceased its activities. The four who left were also vocally incomplete and did not continue as a separate group. Undaunted, Deriashnyj and the remaining dedicated bandurists began to re-group over the next 3‚Äì4 years. An experienced and talented group of singer-bandurists was formed and they aspired towards a professional level of performance. All the while Deriashnyj gave weekly tuition to the younger students attending the bandura class at the School for Bandura in Lidcombe. All the hard work paid off and in November 1975 the Ensemble together with the students of the Sydney School of Bandura gave a concert entitled \\"In the footsteps of the minstrels\\" (–®–ª—è—Ö–∞–º–∏ –ö–æ–±–∑–∞—Ä—ñ–≤). The younger students astounded the audience by playing two parts in the bandura accompaniment and singing in two-voice harmony. Fedir Deriashnyj, a bandurist and craftsman of banduras from Newcastle also performed works that he learned from minstrels in Ukraine during the mid-1920s. Apart from a varied repertoire of Ukrainian folk songs, the Ensemble showed the versatility of the bandura by including in its performance contemporary non-Ukrainian songs adapted and arranged by Deriashnyj - \\"500 Miles\\" (Hedy West), \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" (Bob Dylan) and \\"A Horse with No Name\\" (Dewey Bunnell). This concert had a great positive effect on the Ukrainian younger generation in Sydney. The high quality of the performances and the new repertoire attracted many new students to the group. The numbers of students at the Sydney School of Bandura grew to the point where the Ensemble's committee could no longer cope with the added administrative burden and a parent's committee was established.–ú—ñ—à–∞–ª–æ–≤ –ú. –°—ñ–¥–Ω–µ–π—Å—å–∫–∞ —à–∫–æ–ª–∞ –±–∞–Ω–¥—É—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—ñ–≤.Sydney,1981 Khotkevych quartet In June 1974, finding itself somewhat vocally incomplete, the Ensemble could not celebrate its 10th anniversary with a concert, instead a low-key social event took place. Unfortunately, experienced singer-bandurist Lesia Bilash was given a teaching position in country NSW. But simultaneously, a young university student - Peter Chochula with a bass voice showing great potential began to study the art through private tuition from Deriashnyj. Working enthusiastically through 1975, the group developed a good blend with the voices of the four existing members - Neonila Babchenko-Deriashnyj (soprano), Lidia Deriashnyj-Di-Scullo (Alto), Peter Deriashnyj (tenor) and Peter Chochula (bass). In Jan. 1976 the quartet's performances came to the attention of recording technician Peter Ilyk after a performance at a Canberra international folk festival. Ilyk suggested the ensemble consider recording its repertoire, especially any fresh compositions or arrangements. The Ensemble embarked on recording an LP with some 12 songs from its repertoire. After some 14 months work the master tape was accidentally erased and recording began a fresh‚Äîbut with a higher performance standard and much more instrumental and vocal precision and eventually in 1978 the LP entitled Bandura and Song was released for sale. The members of the quartet were: Neonila Babchenko-Deriashnyj (Soprano), Lidia Deriashnyj-Beal (alto), Peter Chochula (bass) and Peter Deriashnyj (tenor). The quartet toured Australia with concerts and performances selling its LP to audiences in Perth, Western Australia, Hobart, Adelaide, Melbourne and Geelong.\\"EKRAH\\" Youth Magazine 1979 No. 98‚Äì99 p. 18 All Australian Bandura seminars The concert tours and the sales of the LP Bandura and Song had a significant effect on bandura enthusiasts in Melbourne, Adelaide and Canberra. Ensembles in these towns that were already in the making renewed their efforts and began an active concert performing career. The banduras for these ensembles came from Ukraine and were of the Chernihiv type - some were even equipped with mechanisms that enabled the rapid changing of the key to which the instrument was tuned. This permitted the performance of more interesting and challenging bandura works. In 1981, under the initiative of the musical director of the Sydney School of Bandura Roxolana Mishalow, a federal organization was established and registered known as the Federation of Bandurists in Australia. The organization's mandate was to unite the growing number of bandurists in Australia and to share information. A grant was received from the Australia Arts Council to organize a bandura seminar and to pay for a special guest teacher and performer from the USA. The seminar took place at Sydney University in January 1982 with Julian Kytasty as guest tutor and lecturer. 38 bandurist from around Australia participated with the final concert being recorded by SBS television.\\"–í—ñ–ª—å–Ω–∞ –î—É–º–∫–∞\\" –û–ë \\"–°–µ–º—ñ–Ω–∞—Ä –ë–∞–Ω–¥—É—Ä–Ω—Å—Ç—ñ–≤ –ê–≤—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—ñ—ó\\" No.45 (1635) 15.XI.1981 In Jan 1984 another seminar was organized by Dr. Igor Yakubovych from Melbourne's \\"Lesia Ukrainka\\" Bandurist Ensemble and Peter Deriashnyj, where some 25 students from South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland took part. At this seminar a bandurist association called Y.K.C.A. \\"Ukrainian Kobzarski Seminars in Australia\\" was formed by students present. Then in Jan 1985, again under the initiative of the Y.K.C.A. organisation, the largest of seminars took place in Sydney with some 35 bandurist/students attending. 1985‚Äì1994 The Ivasiuk Folk Ensemble years  In June 1984, on the occasion of the 5th anniversary of the suspicious death of Ukrainian contemporary composer V. Ivasiuk, the group took part in a remembrance concert in Sydney where many of the younger generation musician, singers, instrumentalists also took part. The success of this concert saw the founding of the Ivasiuk Folk Ensemble by Peter Deriashnyj. For the next 10 years the Khotkevich Bandurist Ensemble worked as an instrumental support ensemble, effectively forming a choir with bandura accompaniment‚Äîa bandura capella. In the following years this powerful choral instrumental combination saw concert performances in Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. The bandura ensemble still performed as an independent group but the combination with the four-part choral vocals of the Ivasiuk Folk Ensemble was the high-water mark for both groups. At this time much of Deriashnyj's attention was directed toward the Ivasiuk Folk Ensemble so the bandura group's assistant director, Peter Chochulla, took on the capella-master role, managing and organising rehearsals.

Life and career He was the son of Jean Lannes, 1st duc de Montebello, Marshal of the Empire, who died from wounds received during the Battle of Essling on 22 May 1809, and his second wife, Antoinette Scholastica Gu√©henneuc. He was made a peer of France on 27 January 1827 by Charles X in consideration of services rendered by his father, however he took his seat at the Palais du Luxembourg (meeting place of the Chamber of Peers) after the Revolution of 1830. In the meantime, he had traveled to the United States, then was attached to the Embassy of France in Rome, with the vicomte de Chateaubriand. Lannes at first appeared, by his votes, to be linked to the Legitimist faction (which supported the claims to the French throne of the elder line of the House of Bourbon), but he was soon to join fully in support of the July Monarchy and usually then voted with the Doctrinaires. He spoke in many discussions about press freedom, the hereditary peerage (1831), imprisonment for debt, budget, and progress in the army (1832). Back in diplomacy, Lannes was sent on a mission to Denmark at the Court of Copenhagen (1833), then as Minister Plenipotentiary at Berlin. In the Chamber of Peers, he supported the Cousin amendment law repealing the day of mourning in honor of Louis XVI on 21 January. He supported the platform of Partisan laws of September 1835, and proposed to his colleagues to bring them to the manager of the newspaper La Tribune. In 1836, the Duke was appointed as ambassador of France to the Swiss Confederation in place of the marquis de Rumigny, who was considered too favorable to Swiss liberals. He had conflicting sympathies, his appointment being intended to please Austria, with which France was seeking to get closer both to break its isolation in Europe, and to ensure the marital prospects of Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, the heir to the throne. He obtained, from the confederal authorities, the internment of political refugees who might disturb the security of neighboring states, and the expulsion of Prince Louis Napoleon (who lived in Swiss territory at the castle of Arenenberg), but how this application was submitted nearly led to war between the two countries. He was then appointed to represent France in Naples, at the court of the King of the Two Sicilies, Ferdinand II (1838). The Duke of Montebello was recalled from Naples on 1 April 1839, replacing Louis- Mathieu Mol√© as foreign minister in an interim ministry, which was dissolved the following 12 May. He then handed the foreign ministry portfolio to Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, and returned to the Chamber of Peers where he spoke on literary property, on the Legion of Honour, on the Greek loan, and on child labor in factories. He returned to Naples as ambassador in 1840, where he negotiated the marriage of the Duke of Aumale with Marie Caroline de Bourbon, Princess of Salerno (1844). On 9 May 1847, the Duke of Montebello replaced Admiral Baron de Mackau as Minister of Marine and Colonies in the Guizot ministry. He presented, as such a report to the king in which he pronounced against the emancipation of slaves, and several bills relating to the court of assizes in the colonies, the body administering the control and Accounts of the Navy and participated in discussions on the budget, land clearing, on the teaching and practice of medicine and pharmacy. Photographic portrait of Duke of Montebello (Duc de Montebllo), ambassador and senator, by Gustave Le Gray The Duke of Montebello left government following the Revolution of 1848. However, soon after, as part of a coalition of \\"old parties\\", the Duke was elected, on 13 May 1849, to the Second Republic's Legislative Assembly. The Duke represented the department of Marne, where he owned large vineyards. Lannes was part of the commission which called for an extension and confined himself to vote consistently with the majority: for the Roman expedition, for the law-Falloux Parieu on free education, and for the restriction of universal suffrage. He did not immediately support the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851. But he changed his mind and, on 15 February 1858, he was appointed ambassador to Russia instead of Count Rayneval. In this position, where he remained until 1864, he had to negotiate, among other things, the agreement of 6 April 1861, for the reciprocal guarantee works of art and spirit. By decree of Emperor Napoleon III, on 5 October 1864, he was appointed a Senator. He retired as ambassador on 6 January 1866. He had long represented the canton of Ay in the General Council of the Marne, which was one of the vice-presidents. Family He married Eleanor Jenkinson in 1830, a daughter of Sir Charles Jenkinson. They had two daughters and six sons. One of his brothers was Gustave de Montebello.

Such a pregnancy typically aborts within the first trimester, however, if it is implanted closer to the uterine cavity ‚Äì a so- called cervico-isthmic pregnancy ‚Äì it may continue longer. Placental removal in a cervical pregnancy may result in major hemorrhage. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made in asymptomatic pregnant women either by inspection seeing a bluish discolored cervix or, more commonly, by obstetric ultrasonography. A typical non-specific symptom is vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Ultrasound will show the location of the gestational sac in the cervix, while the uterine cavity is \\"empty\\". Cervical pregnancy can be confused with a miscarriage when pregnancy tissue is passing through the cervix. Histologically the diagnosis has been made by Rubin's criteria on the surgical specimen: cervical glands are opposite the trophoblastic tissue, the trophoblastic attachment is below the entrance of the uterine vessels to the uterus or the anterior peritoneal reflection, and fetal elements are absent from the uterine corpus. As many pregnancies today are diagnosed early and no hysterectomy is performed, Rubin's criteria can often not be applied. Management True cervical pregnancies tend to abort; if, however, the pregnancy is located higher in the canal and the placenta finds support in the uterine cavity it can go past the first trimester. With the placenta being implanted abnormally extensive vaginal bleeding can be expected at time of delivery and placental removal. While early cervical pregnancies may abort spontaneously or can be managed with excision, D&C;, suturing, electrocautery, and tamponading, by medication such as methotrexate, and/or by uterine artery embolization, a more advanced pregnancy may require a hysterectomy to control bleeding. The more advanced the pregnancy the higher the risk for a major bleeding necessitating a hysterectomy. On a very rare occasion, a cervical pregnancy results in the birth of a live baby, typically the pregnancy is in the upper part of the cervical canal and manages to extend into the lower part of the uterine cavity. A cervical pregnancy can develop together with a normal intrauterine pregnancy; such a heterotopic pregnancy will call for expert management as to not to endanger the intrauterine pregnancy. Epidemiology The incidence has been reported to be about 1:1,000 to 1:16,000 pregnancies. Pregnancies involving the isthmus ‚Äì the segment of the uterus between the cervix and the fundus ‚Äì are more common than true cervical pregnancies. While in many situations the cause of the abnormal implantation remains unclear, there is evidence to link the development of cervical pregnancy to uterine instrumentation, specifically repeated D&Cs; (dilatation and curettage). Cervical pregnancies are to be distinguished from pregnancies that start from an implantation in a scar of a previous cesarean section, so-called scar pregnancies.

FANS includes many components from human to avionics hardware and a dedicated network linking Air Traffic Control (ATC) to the flight crew via satellite and landlines. FANS 1/A consists of CPDLC and ADS-C. CPDLC allows communications between the pilot and ATC and ADS-C is an electronic contract, valid through the duration of time the aircraft is in FANS 1/A airspace, offered by ATC and accepted by the flight crew. ADS-C provides aircraft position information to ATC including heading, altitude, airspeed and position. The communications include air traffic control clearances, pilot requests, and position reporting. FANS-1 is Boeing's solution and FANS-A is the Airbus solution. The main industry standards describing the operation of FANS-1/A products are ARINC 622 and EUROCAE ED-100/RTCA DO-258. Both the Airbus A-380 and Boeing 787 have FANS-1/A capability. ATC services are now provided to aircraft equipped with FANS-1/A in other Oceanic airspace such as the North Atlantic. Although many of FANS-1/A's known deficiencies with respect to its use in high density airspace were addressed in later versions of the product (FANS-1/A+), it has never been fully adopted for use in continental airspace.  Certification  For an aircraft and the flight crew to operate in FANS airspace the avionics and flight crew must be certified. AirSatOne has a dedicated FANS 1/A test station connection to the FANS 1/A Datalink backbone which allows the company to perform functionality testing in accordance with RTCA DO-258A/ED-100A and demonstrate compliance with AC 20-140C to support FANS 1/A operational approval. The same FANS 1/A test station is also used to train pilots to operate in FANS 1/A airspace using their actual avionics equipment while safely on the ground.

The diac is the triggering device for the triac. Thyristors are four-layer (PNPN) semiconductor devices that act as switches, rectifiers or voltage regulators in a variety of applications. When triggered, thyristors turn on and become low-resistance current paths. They remain so even after the trigger is removed, and until the current is reduced to a certain level (or until they are triggered off). Diacs are bi-directional diodes that switch AC voltages and trigger triacs or silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs). Except for a small leakage current, diacs do not conduct until the breakover voltage is reached. Triacs are three-terminal, silicon devices that function as two SCRs configured in an inverse, parallel arrangement. They provide load current during both halves of the AC supply voltage. By combining the functions of diacs and triacs, quadracs eliminate the need to buy and assemble discrete parts. Quadracs are used in lighting control, speed control, and temperature modulation control applications. They carry performance specifications such as peak repetitive off voltage, peak repetitive reverse voltage, root mean square (RMS) on-state current, and temperature junction. Peak repetitive off voltage is the maximum, instantaneous value of the off-state voltage that occurs across a thyristor, including all repetitive transient voltages and excluding all non-transient voltages. Peak repetitive reverse voltage is the maximum peak reverse voltage that may be applied continuously to the main terminals (anode and cathode) of quadracs. RMS on-state current is the maximum RMS current allowed for the specified use-case temperature. Temperature junction for quadracs is expressed as a full-required range.  Packages  Quadracs are available in a variety of integrated circuit (IC) package types with different numbers of pins. Basic IC packages types for quadracs include discrete packaging (DPAK), power packaging (PPAK), and in-line packaging (IPAK). Other IC package types include diode outline (DO), transistor outline (TO), and small outline transistor (SOT). Quadracs that use metal electrode leadless face (MELF) packaging have metallized terminals at each end of a cylindrical body. Other available package types for quadracs include thin small outline package (TSOP), thin shrink small outline L-leaded package (TSSOP), and thin small outline J-lead (TSOJ) package.

Ramos, (17 September 1887 - 13 November 1955) was a Belizean civil rights activist who promoted the interests of the Garifuna people, and is now considered a national hero. Background T. V. Ramos was born in Puerto Cort√©s, Honduras, on 17 September 1887 and was educated at Wesleyan Methodist primary schools in Stann Creek Town, British Honduras (now Dangriga, Belize), and Belize City. He took correspondence courses in business administration, public speaking, journalism and accountancy. Ramos married Elisa Marian Fuentes in 1914. He moved permanently to Stann Creek Town in 1923 but did not formally become a British subject until one year before his death in 1955. Social activist After moving to British Honduras, Ramos became a school teacher. He was also a visionary leader. Concerned about the systematic neglect of health facilities for Garinagu in Stann Creek Town, he founded the Carib Development and Sick Aid Society and later the Carib International Society, which had affiliations in Guatemala and Honduras. The purpose of the Carib Development Society was to help the sick and to assist those who need financial assistance to bury their dead. The society owns of land that was called the Carib Reserve at Sarawee in the Stann Creek valley. He lobbied successfully for the colonial authorities to provide native Garifuna nurses in the local hospital. Ramos was a Methodist, a preacher, and wrote several Garifuna hymns. Some of them are sung each year at his memorial.Ramos, Adele. \\"52nd tribute to T.V. Ramos\\". Amandala, 18 November 2008. (accessed 22 May 2015) T. V. Ramos was a contemporary of Marcus Garvey, and was involved in Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association. He fought discrimination against Garifuna people, including all Afro-Belizeans. He was founder of the Independent Manhood and Exodus Uplift Society and the Colonial Industrial Instruction Association. He was a prolific contributor to the newspapers. For example, writing in the Belize Independent on 21 January 1942 Ramos complained of the brutality of some Wesleyan School teachers towards their students, and the immorality of some of the female pupil teachers. In 1940, as leader and spokesman of the Garifuna people along with Pantaleon Hernandez and Domingo Ventura he approached the governor of the colony and asked for establishment of a public and bank holiday to observe the Garifuna arrival in Belize. The request was granted and the Carib Disembarkation Day, later named Garifuna Settlement Day, was first celebrated in Stann Creek District on 19 November 1941. The holiday was recognized in Toledo District in 1943 and throughout the country in 1977. Legacy Ramos died on 13 November 1955 and was laid to rest the following day. Since 1956, A torchlight parade has been held on 13 November every year in honor of his contributions to Belize and to his people. The parade is part of the week-long lead-up to the Garifuna Settlement Day that he established, which includes selection of Miss Garifuna, parades and special church services, and The T. V.

He was nicknamed \\"The Count\\" by journalists and reporters for his \\"elegance\\" and manners. Biography Early life Charpentier was born on May 14, 1935, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the second youngest of his father, Fulgence Charpentier's, six children. Fulgence Charpentier had his four eldest children with his first wife, who died. Fulgence remarried to his second wife, Louise Dionne, shortly afterwards. The couple had their two youngest children, including Jean Charpentier. Fulgence Charpentier, who had worked as a journalist covering the Parliament of Canada, was the acting Mayor of Ottawa at the time of Jean Charpentier's birth. Fulgence Charpentier worked for the Canadian federal government as a diplomat and wartime censorship director during World War II. His father was posted to the Canadian embassy in Paris, under Georges Vanier in 1948, and was the first Ambassador to African francophonie, based in Cameroon, beginning in the 1960s. Fulgence Charpentier died in 2001. Journalism career Jean Charpentier learned Spanish in 1953 while his father was posted at the Canadian embassy in Uruguay. In the 1950s, Charpentier began working as a journalist for two French-language Canadian newspapers, Le Devoir and Le Droit. A colleague at the Le Droit, Denis Gratton, coined Charpentier's nickname, \\"The Count,\\" while working at the newspaper, for his courtesy and manners. He became a television reporter for Radio-Canada, the French-language broadcaster for the CBC, in 1961, where he reported from Paris, London, Toronto and Lima, Cambodia, Vietnam, Argentina and Nigeria's breakaway region of Biafra. Charpentier covered the October Crisis in Quebec in 1970. He became the first foreign journalist to interview Augusto Pinochet following the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat which overthrew Salvador Allende. Charpentier left television journalism in the 1970s. His family had connections to then Prime Minister Trudeau through his father and two brothers, who were all diplomats in the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. Charpentier would serve as Pierre Trudeau's press secretary from 1975 until 1979. Trudeau's press secretary Charpentier became Trudeau's press secretary at a time of increased friction between the Prime Minister and the Canadian media. Trudeau severely disliked the press corps, who had developed a reputation for confronting parliamentarians in the hallways of Parliament with difficult questions. The Prime Minister's communication director, Richard O'Hagan, moved Trudeau's press conferences to the Government Conference Centre to better fit the Prime Minister's image. As press secretary, Charpentier headed the Prime Minister's press conferences at the Conference Centre. He won the respect of the press corps by balancing the competing interests of the print and broadcast media, and, more importantly, the French and English-speaking reporters. He made sure that the same number of French speaking reporters from Quebec were called upon as the larger English-speaker contingent of reporters. It is believed that Charpentier had Trudeau write a public letter announcing his separation from his wife, Margaret Trudeau, in 1977, declaring the marital problems as a private matter. Later life In 1979, Trudeau's government was ended by the opposition Progressive Conservatives, led by Joe Clark. Charpentier became a communications consultant at the Treasury Board. The Canadian government asked Charpentier to arrange the official papal visit by Pope John Paul II to the country. He spent the rest of his career as a freelance translator. In 1990, he married Mary Mackay. Jean Charpentier died from cancer on January 8, 2010, in Ottawa at the age of 74. He was survived by his wife, Mary Mackay, and her four children, Tina, Dwayne, Shawn and Derek. He was survived by three siblings - Claire, Louise and Jacques - and predeceased by two brothers, Pierre and Georges.

He was sired by Flares, a son of U.S. Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox and a full brother to U.S. Triple Crown winner Omaha. Flares raced in England with considerable success for owner William Woodward, Sr., counting the Ascot Gold Cup, Champion Stakes and Princess of Wales's Stakes among his wins. Purchased as a yearling for $4,100 by Josephine Douglas of Oyster Bay, New York, Chop Chop saw his racing career cut short due to an injury. From eleven starts, he won four times and finished out of the money once. His most important wins came in the 1942 Endurance Handicap at Bowie Race Track in Bowie, Maryland and the 1943 Empire City Handicap at New York's Jamaica Race Course, in which he beat Princequillo in track record time. Stud record Retired to stud duty, Chop Chop was sent to a breeding farm in Kentucky but in 1945 was leased by Gil Darlington, owner of Trafalgar Farm near Oakville, Ontario. Not given much consideration by most in the racing industry, Chop Chop did not attract any top-quality mares for breeding. As a result, his first five years in Canada showed no significant offspring until after he was sold, when Chain Reaction began winning major races in 1953. Chop Chop's breeding career changed when E. P. Taylor bought him at a dispersal sale and stood him at his National Stud of Canada in Oshawa, Ontario. Chop Chop was mated to Taylor's mare Iribelle, and their daughter Canadiana was foaled in 1950. Canadiana's success in racing resulted in Chop Chop being bred to the best of the Taylor mares and as a consequence, he was the leading sire in Canada from 1959 through 1963. Among his progeny, Chop Chop was the sire of four Queen's Plate winners and two Hall of Fame inductees: * Canadiana (b. 1950) - a filly, she won the 1953 Queen's Plate and was the first Canadian-bred to earn more than $100,000. Voted 1952 Canadian Horse of the Year, a Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee; * Lyford Cay (b. 1954), won 1957 Queen's Plate; * Victoria Park (b. 1957) - won 1960 Queen's Plate, voted Canadian Horse of the Year, a Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Leading broodmare sire in Great Britain & Ireland (1977), sire of three Queen's Plate winners; * Blue Light (b. 1958) - won 1961 Queen's Plate. Through his daughter Ciboulette, Chop Chop was the damsire of Eclipse and Sovereign Award winner and Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Fanfreluche. Chop Chop's bloodline endures in the 2015 U.S. Triple Crown winner, American Pharoah, who is a seventh-generation descendant. For his contribution to Canadian racing, in 1977 Chop Chop was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

Biography His secondary education was at Abingdon School and D'Overbroeck's College. He left school at the age of 16, without having completed his GCE Advanced Level examinations. After a spell at Oxford Aviation Training, since early 2008 rebranded as Oxford Aviation Academy, Halstead decided that rather than complete his studies for a Commercial Pilot Licence, he would prefer to set up his own airline and focus on managing an aviation business. Alpha One Airways Halstead first attracted media attention in the UK in March 2005 when, at the age of 18, he announced the launch of Alpha One Airways. Alpha One Airways never applied for an Air Operator's Certificate. Instead Halstead planned to subcontract the operation of flights to another carrier. Alpha One Airways was due to launch its commercial services on the route linking Oxford and Cambridge with flights starting on 18 April 2005. Alpha One never operated any services on the route, although from 1 February 2006 another small airline, Sky Commuter, for a few weeks had scheduled flights linking the two university cities. At the September 2005 B2B Routes Conference, held at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Halstead spoke confidently of his plans for Alpha One Airways, remarking that \\"the reception here at Routes has been very positive. The airports we're seeing are taking us very seriously and want to see us succeed\\" and \\"We have more than enough money to operate without a single passenger for six months\\". Returning from the Copenhagen Routes Conference, Halstead then made announcements of new routes for Alpha One Airways, including a route from Cambridge to Bristol and from Jersey to the Isle of Man. Flights from Cambridge never started, nor did flights from Jersey, but Halstead then unveiled a new plan for Alpha One Airways, this time working from a base at Southampton Airport and commencing operations on 7 November 2005 with flights to the Isle of Man. During this time, press reports appeared largely uncritical, focusing on Mr Halstead's age, his plans, or his personality. A more sceptical note was sounded by Cambridge University student newspaper, Varsity. In October 2005, it reported Halstead's claims that he had twenty employees. (the company having evidently downsized from the alleged 31 employees of six months earlier) After Alpha One Airways In an interview with The Oxford Times in October 2006, Halstead reflected on the Alpha One experience, admitting that he \\"had almost lost a sense of normality for a while.\\" The newspaper reported that Halstead was working again, this time at a music shop in Oxford city centre. Halstead became a director of the company which owned the shop. The company, called Delicious Music Republic, ceased trading shortly thereafter. Varsity Express In January 2010 Halstead set up a new aviation venture called Varsity Express. Halstead stated that Varsity Express had sufficient funds to operate for six months without carrying a single passenger. Ten days prior to Varsity's first flight, Halstead also claimed that his nascent airline already employed about 20 people. The new company started services between Oxford and Edinburgh on 1 March 2010 and suspended operations one week later, after Halstead failed to pay fees due in respect of the small aircraft he had leased to operate the service. Thirteen passengers were left stranded because the second leg of their return tickets was not honoured. The Times newspaper reported allegations that Martin had used a fictitious name to pose as both the commercial director and financial director, spoke of fictitious investors, and asked four newly qualified pilot recruits to pay up to ¬£15000 for specialised training that was never provided. An investigation by the Thames Valley Police found that no criminal offence had taken place, clearing him from criminal wrongdoing. Mr Halstead stated that he lost ¬£3,500 of his own money in the venture.

The reservoir's existence is due to the Entwistle Dam. When constructed in 1832 the Entwistle Dam was the highest in Britain; it rises 108 feet from the base. The reservoir contains almost 750 thousand imperial gallons (roughly 3,400,000 litres) and, with the Wayoh Reservoir just below, satisfies around 50% of Bolton's need for drinking water. Entwistle Dam was designed by Thomas Ashworth, a local land surveyor, overseen by Jesse Hartley, the Liverpool Docks engineer. Other works were by Joseph Jackson, an engineer and surveyor from Bolton. It was built for the Commissioners of the Turton and Entwistle Reservoir, a group of local mill owners who obtained an enabling Act of Parliament in 1832 to regulate the supply of water in Bradshaw Brook for water power for the finishing textiles. Records suggest it was built entirely of puddle clay with no distinct core. Earth dams usually have a waterproof cutoff under their earthworks designed to stop seepage under the dam but it is doubtful whether there was any such a cutoff at Entwistle. The reservoir has a rock-cut outlet tunnel driven through the valley side rather than a culvert or pipeline and a siphon draw-off pipe. The dam is 108 ft high and 110 metres long at the crest. The present overflow channel and valve tower were added by the Bolton Corporation Water Works who took over the reservoir in 1864.

The hand took its name from the fact that it was particularly associated with formal records of the courts of Common Pleas and King's (or Queen's) Bench, although its use was not confined to them. In the 17th and 18th centuries the writing became increasingly stylised, to the point that it was virtually illegible to any reader unfamiliar with its conventions. The hand was banned from English law courts in 1731 by the Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act (4 Geo.

In a media interview conducted prior to his journey and published after his arrest, Park said he believed it was his duty as a Christian to do whatever he could to protest against human rights violations in the country, and that he was entering North Korea to call forcefully for the release of political prisoners, who he has argued through numerous articles are victims of genocide and crimes against humanity as defined under international law. While under arrest, Park made a public confession and apology for his actions. On February 5, 2010 the North Korean government announced that it had pardoned Park. He was deported by plane to Beijing, China, from where he was then flown back to the United States. He later recanted his confession as having been made under duress, and reported having suffered torture and beatings during his detention. He was hospitalized for PTSD on multiple occasions following his detention, sometimes spanning a number of months. Post-release As a victim of North Korean torture, Park is preparing to file a lawsuit in the U.S. Federal Court under the Torture Victims Protection Act of 1991. His writings on the North Korean human rights situation have been published in the Harvard International Review, The Washington Post, Haaretz, San Jose Mercury News, Asia Times, South China Morning Post, National Post, The Diplomat, World Policy, Columbia Journal of International Affairs, The Hill, The Korea Times, and numerous other publications.Robert Park.\\"North Korea and the Genocide Movement\\", Harvard International Review, September 27, 2011.Robert Park.\\"When will we stop the genocide in North Korea?\\", Washington Post, April 21, 2011.Robert Park.\\"Battling a system of starvation\\", Haaretz, December 9, 2011.Robert Park.\\"Robert Park: North Korean refugees face slaughter when China repatriates them\\", San Jose Mercury News, February 28, 2012.Robert Park.\\"North Korea and the Genocide Convention\\", Asia Times, September 9, 2011.Robert Park.\\"The case for genocide in North Korea\\", Korea Herald, February 8, 2012.Robert Park.\\"US silence on North Korea\\", Korea Times, November 14, 2012.

On December 19, 2011, Genocide Watch, an international NGO and human rights watchdog, published a report which quoted heavily from a 2011 article penned by Park for the Asia Times, entitled \\"North Korea and the Genocide Convention.\\" The paper concluded North Korea was actively committing genocide as defined by the UN Genocide Convention.Hye-Won, Kim. \\"GENOCIDE and POLITICIDE ALERT: NORTH KOREA\\", \\"Genocide Watch\\", December 19, 2011.Robert, Park. \\"North Korea and the Genocide Convention\\", Asia Times, September 9, 2011. Park has repeatedly called for concerned persons and organizations to increase financial support towards North Korean defectors, who are able to remit money back to their families in the North, potentially making possible an organized movement to halt atrocities. An 80-page report produced by independent international law firm Hogan Lovells on 18 June 2014 determined there was \\"a strong case that certain actions committed by the North Korean government are tantamount to genocide.\\" The report's findings differ in that particular respect from the conclusions of an earlier United Nations Commission of Inquiry. \\"We consider that there may be good arguments that the targeting by DPRK state-controlled officials of groups classified by the DPRK as being in the hostile class, Christians, and children of Chinese heritage with the intent to destroy such groups could be found to amount to genocide,\\" the Hogan Lovells report states.\\"Independent Report Finds Evidence of Genocide in North Korea\\", Hogan Lovells, 18 June 2014 Park is firmly anti-war and advocates consistently for support and outreach to the North Korean people, whom he regards as victims of the forcibly installed Kim family dynasty.

The Exposition Flyer had been coming through on the same track at . 45 people died, and some 125 were injured. Trains The Advance Flyer and Exposition Flyer were diesel-powered high-speed inter-city passenger trains; the Exposition Flyer would soon be replaced by the California Zephyr. Both were scheduled to leave Chicago's Union Station at 12:35 PM, the Advance Flyer took a two-minute lead as they both sped west in two sections. The day of the wreck the Advance Flyer had 2 EMD E7 locomotives with 8 head-end and 5 passenger cars. The Exposition Flyer had EMD E5A&B; locomotives with 9 passenger cars, four of which were sleepers. This was a short train for the run; normally 12 to 16 cars were needed. Setting Naperville is a suburb in Illinois' DuPage County 28 miles west of Union Station along the CB&Q;'s main line from Chicago to Aurora. This well- maintained three-track line, nicknamed \\"the Racetrack\\" by locals, had heavy traffic. The outside tracks typically had freight and local commuter trains running in one direction only on each. The center track, signaled in both directions, was used by intercity and express commuter passenger trains. The Flyers normally ran through Naperville on the center track at . Wreck Just after 1:00 PM on April 25, 1946, a mechanical problem caused the Advance Flyer to stop at Loomis St. in Naperville, just beyond a gradual curve that trains came through at speed. A flagman had just started back up the tracks when the Exposition Flyer, led by a locomotive named \\"Silver Speed\\", came into view. According to engineer W. W. Blaine of the Exposition Flyer, he immediately applied brakes upon seeing the first of two warning signals, but it was still too close to the first train to stop in time. The Exposition Flyer, slowing from , was still traveling over when it struck the rear of the Advance Flyer. When the locomotive hit the last car (#13) of the Advance Flyer, a 68-seat heavyweight coach, the locomotive's front truck detached and the body plowed through three fourths of the length of the car, killing most of its passengers. The locomotive continued for a total of beyond the point of impact. Car #12, a heavyweight observation car, remained intact and pushed forward into car #11, a lightweight diner. The only car on either train not built to the then-current strength standards, it collapsed into a U-shape, with multiple deaths. Lightweight 52-seat chair car #10 tipped on its side. #9 derailed and was leaning. None of the head-end cars derailed or were damaged. The Exposition Flyer's locomotives were badly damaged, the all-heavyweight train less so. Cars #1 to #5 all derailed, but the only damage was between cars #2 and #3; the front vestibule of #3 was collapsed about . Rescue The Kroehler Furniture company was next to the crash scene; hundreds of employees rushed to help, and an aid station was set up in their warehouse. Fifty North Central College students and countless local residents also helped. Emergency workers came from as far as Hinsdale, more than away. Most of the wounded were brought to hospitals in Aurora; bodies were taken to local funeral homes. Engineer Blaine of the Exposition Flyer, who stayed at his station, climbed out of the wreckage and made his way unassisted to an aid station, despite a head wound and fractured skull. The fireman, who jumped before the impact, was the only person on the Exposition Flyer who died. The railroad sent a special relief train with doctors and nurses. By late night all injured and most bodies had been recovered. All three mainline tracks were blocked by wreckage. It was 27 hours before trains started to slowly move through the crash site and three days before all wreckage was cleared. Aftermath There were four investigations of the wreck. In the first, a DuPage County Coroner's inquest recommended that manslaughter charges be filed against the engineer of the Exposition Flyer. He was charged, but not taken into custody, as he was in the hospital at the time. He would not recover enough to be directly questioned in any of the investigations. The Burlington's investigation started on April 28, three days after the wreck. Brake tests showed that the wreck could have been avoided, or less serious, if the engineer had followed the rules, but the overall objectivity of the investigation was questioned. DuPage County District Attorney Lee Daniels said the railroad was \\"rehearsing the evidence\\". It was suspended for the grand jury's investigation. An Interstate Commerce Commission report, dated July 30, 1946, made recommendations that would affect railroads across the country. It also compared older heavyweight cars to newer lightweight ones (the Advance Flyer had a mixed consist). In October a DuPage County grand jury found the railroad and some employees were negligent, but that no single act caused the wreck, it was a combination of many. No indictments were made, and charges against the Exposition Flyer's engineer were dropped. The engineer of the Exposition Flyer was the center of all the investigations. He said he was going too fast. The railroad said the signals were functioning correctly. Questions were raised about braking. The engineer said he had put the brakes in \\"emergency\\", and witnesses reported the wheels were sparking, but physical evidence did not support that and crewmembers felt that the train was only in \\"service\\" braking before the impact. There were questions about the conductor of the Advance Flyer stopping the train just beyond the curve, and whether the flagman did his job effectively. The railroad scheduling fast trains so close together was a problem, as was the mixing of lightweight and heavyweight cars, and the order of the cars. Long- term results This crash is a major reason why most passenger trains in the United States have a speed limit of . The CB&Q;, Milwaukee Road, and Illinois Central were among railroads in the region running passenger trains at up to and above in the 1930s and 1940s. The Interstate Commerce Commission ruled in 1951 that trains traveling 80 mph or more must have \\"an automatic cab signal, automatic train stop or automatic train control system\\", expensive technology that was implemented on some lines in the region, but has since been mostly removed. The Burlington increased headway on the two trains from 2 minutes to 15 minutes in May, and added a signal position, flashing yellow, for a total of 4 positions. They continued to haul mixed heavyweight/lightweight trains, but at the time they were already rapidly replacing heavyweight cars with stainless steel lightweight \\"Zephyr\\" type cars. All units in both trains would return to service except the Advance Flyer's last coach and the dining car; both were total losses. Following this disaster, advancements in train speed in the United States essentially halted. However, select Amtrak passenger trains run at up to as of 2013. In 2012 Chuck Spinner published The Tragedy at the Loomis Street Crossing. Because of the interest generated by the book, a Naperville committee selected Paul Kuhn to create a sculpture at the crash site. The sculpture, commemorating both the victims and the rescue workers involved in the tragic wreck, was dedicated in 2014. Kuhn's sculpture is made of 5,000 railroad spikes.

It was located in the upper basin of the Neman River (present-day northern Poland, southern Lithuania, western Belarus and Kaliningrad Oblast). In the north, the Neman culture bordered the Kunda culture during the Mesolithic and the Narva culture during the Neolithic. Mesolithic During the Atlantic period, the climate warmed and broad-leaved tree forests covered much of the territory. The migrating reindeer, mainstay of the Paleolithic hunters, retreated to the North and were followed by forest animals. The people adapted to the changed environment. They were still nomadic, but traveled shorter distances and stayed in the same place for longer periods. The archaeologists found small camps used just once and larger camps to which hunters returned repeatedly. These camps were usually located near lakes or rivers. The people used to hunt with arrows and spears and fish with harpoons. The flint tools of Mesolithic Neman culture were influenced both by microliths from southeastern Europe and macroliths from northern Europe (Maglemosian culture). Therefore, the culture was initially called Microlithic‚ÄìMacrolithic culture to avoid confusion with the already established Neolithic Neman culture. Despite variety of influences, the culture was rather stable for 2500‚Äì3000 years indicating no significant migrations. Therefore, the artifacts are rather unvaried stock of arrowheads, trapezoid blades, oval axes. Neolithic The Neolithic began with the appearance of pottery in mid 5th millennium BC. The Semi-Neolithic Neman culture was a successor of the Mesolithic Neman culture. Most of flint tools are very similar between both cultures. A new widespread development was knives with sharpened and flared point. Pottery of the Neman culture had pointed bottoms and was made of clay mixed with organic matter or crushed quartzite. Some latter examples have flat bottoms. The vessels were a bit narrower and curvier than of the Narva culture. They were decorated with a thin layer of white clay and rows of small imprints around the rim. The rest of the vessel had diagonal stripes forming a pattern of a fishnet or more rows of small imprints. Some pottery found in settlements of the Neman culture was made by Narva culture. Such phenomenon is explained by trade of flint, which Narva culture in the north did not have. Towards the end of the Neman culture, the pottery became more varied and exhibits influence of the Rzucewo culture: imprints made by a cord or resembling a fir. Eventually, the culture was overtaken by the Corded Ware culture and the Globular Amphora culture.

Her mother was French and her father was Greek from Ayvalik, Turkey. She grew up in Greece, where she attended elementary and secondary school. World War II broke out in 1940 before she could finish her schooling. Life and career During the war, Sarivaxevani (later Georges Sari or Sarri) joined the Resistance and fought with the United Panhellenic Organization of Youth (EPON). Looking back on that era, she herself noted that ‚Äúthe years during the Nazi occupation were a time of happiness and freedom. We went from being miserable to happy because we chose the road of life, even if death had a place there as well. We grieved and rejoiced all together, but we were not afraid. There was one goal: liberation‚Äù.Georges Sari, ‚ÄúThe children are strict judges‚Äù (interview with Nemesis Magazine (October 1999), issue 3, page 125. She graduated while Greece was still under Nazi occupation and began taking acting lessons at Dimitris Rontiris' drama school. Georges Sari was injured during the Greek Civil War, which followed right after World War II, suffering wounds to her hand and foot from a bomb explosion. She received treatment at Aghia Olga Hospital. In 1947, she was forced to leave for Paris in exile. She worked various jobs while living there, while also enrolling as a student at the Charles Dullin School of Dramatic Art. Sari returned to Greece together with her family in 1962 and continued acting in the theater until the rise of the Military junta, at which point she decided along with other actor acquaintances to engage in passive resistance and no longer act in the theater. That summer, deprived as she was of any means of expression, she wrote her first novel ‚Äì The Treasure of Vaghia ‚Äì which started off like a game together with the children who surrounded her. Sari decided to dedicate her life to writing: ‚ÄúIn writing, I discovered all that I could not find in the theater, perhaps because I was not a leading lady or perhaps because I was not in a position to choose the roles that the producer or director would select for me. I now bear the full responsibility for my books. I do what I want; what I can.‚Äù\\"Everyone is not writing in order to save the others but only to save himself\\", Interview with Mesimvrini, 16 September 1980. She wrote numerous books. In 1994 she won the Best Children Literature book award for her book Ninet (which was a semi-autobiography of her sister). In 1995 and 1999 she was awarded with the Greek Cycle of Books. In 1988 she was nominated for the Hans Christian Andersen Award. Furthermore, as an actress, she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in the Thessaloniki Film Festival. Death Sari died in Athens on 9 June 2012, aged 87.Notice of death of Georges Sari, tovima.gr; accessed 27 March 2015.

Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprise their roles as Clark and Ellen Griswold. It was the first time Clark and Ellen had been seen in a Vacation film since 1997's Vegas Vacation; they later appeared together again in 2015's Vacation. The fourteen-minute short premiered as a series of commercials during the Super Bowl to help promote HomeAway, Inc. Although sanctioned by Warner Bros. (which holds the underlying rights to the Vacation series characters and concepts), this film was not sponsored by National Lampoon, Inc., which initiated the Vacation series. On November 18, 2009, Us Weekly reported that HomeAway announced it was planning to use Chevy Chase and Beverly D‚ÄôAngelo in a national advertising campaign which would resemble National Lampoon‚Äôs Vacation. HomeAway purchased a replica of the Wagon Queen Family Truckster for use in the campaign. The first ad aired during the CBS television network broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010. Plot Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo) are driving their Wagon Queen Family Truckster to visit their son Rusty and his family, who are spending their vacation by renting a beach house. Clark and Ellen make a detour for the night at the Le Grand Connard, a very sophisticated hotel. Clark begins seeing a brunette beauty around the hotel and is instantly attracted. After having mis-communications with the receptionist at the front desk (Robert Stephenson), Clark and Ellen finally get into their room, the Napoleon suite, which turns out to be very small. The adjacent rooms are also close enough for the guest next door, Doug, to hear every move that goes on inside their room. While Ellen talks to Rusty (Travis Greer) and his wife and daughter through the web cam, Clark's genitals accidentally become visible on the web cam because of the small shower. Clark and Ellen decide to spend the night having a fancy dinner in the hotel restaurant but are told that it is booked due to a \\"Shout Yourself Thin\\" seminar going on at the same time. The two try to order room service but to no avail. Clark later fries an egg on the flat iron. As the two leave, they notice they are being charged for Internet, phone calls, etc. They are most likely charged for not buying towels from the receptionist.

Tutt Sr. and Josephine Thayer Tutt on January 9, 1889. Of four children born to the couple, Charles Jr. was the only one to survive childhood. He grew up in Colorado Springs. His father was a school friend of Spencer Penrose in Philadelphia and a business partner in Colorado. Charles Jr. graduated in 1903 from St. George's School in Newport, Rhode Island. Three years later he graduated from The Thacher School in Ojai, California. On August 16, 1909, Tutt married Eleanor Armit. They had four children: Charles Leaming Tutt, III, William Thayer Tutt, Russell Thayer Tutt, and Josephine Thayer Tutt. In 1934, he married Vesta H. Wood (1900-1983), who was an archaeologist who graduated from Vassar College and Oxford University. They had one son, John Wood Tutt. The McAllister House Museum in Colorado Springs has a plaque at its front door in her honor. Career During World War I, Tutt served in the Army as a captain. After that, he worked for a year in the real estate business. Tutt was secretary and treasurer of Electric and Manufacturing Company, Grand Junction Gas, and Grand River Valley Railroad Company. He was president of Beaver Fruit and Preserving Company, Beaver Park Land and Irrigation, and Beaver, Penrose and Northern Railroad. He was director of the Granite Gold Mine, Colorado Midland Railway, and Colorado Title and Trust Company. Tutt was the secretary of the Broadmoor Hotel and Land Company until Penrose's death in 1939, when he became president of The Broadmoor, owned by Penrose's charitable organization, El Pomar Foundation. He became head of the foundation in 1956 with Julie Penrose's death. The Tutt Library at Colorado College is named for Tutt, who served as a trustee of Colorado College. In 1959, the house he had lived in with his parents was donated to the school, and it is now known as the Tutt Alumni House.Colorado College Campus Map/Tour He died in 1961 at the age of 72. In 1992, Edward H. Honnen (from the 1921 Class of Colorado Springs High School) commissioned sculptor Cloyd Barnes to create a statue of Tutt, which was placed in front of the Tutt Library. Over the years, the statue has been decorated in various ways, and they have done so with affection, imagination and a sense of humor. References Sources  Denise R. W.

It is owned and operated by Southwestern Public Service Company, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy. History At the time Plant X was being designed, power plants were usually named after their location. During the initial stages of the design process, no location had been selected, so engineers referred to the generating station simply as ‚ÄúPlant X‚Äù and the name stuck. When the President of Southwestern Public Service Company announced that the company planned to build a new power plant on the high plains of the Llano Estacado, William L. Broadhurst of the Division of Ground Water of the Geological Survey recommended that they build it in the Sand Hills area of Lamb County.McCain, C. 2008. W.L. Broadhurst, first High Plains Water District hydrologist, dies at 103. The Cross Section 54(11):2. The USGS groundwater program had already determined that there was an unusually large saturated thickness of freshwater in the Ogallala Aquifer beneath the Sand Hills. As a result, Plant X was located where Broadhurst suggested. Plant X is primarily powered by natural gas, although fuel oil can be used as an alternative. It has four operating units: Unit 1 was brought on-line in 1952 and is capable of producing 48 MW; Unit 2 was added in 1953 and has a production capability of 102 MW; Unit 3 was constructed in 1955 and is rated at 103 MW, and Unit 4 is a 189 MW unit, added in 1964. The total power production capability of Plant X is 442 MW. Water use With regard to water-use efficiency, Plant X was designed to be a \\"zero- discharge facility,\\" which means no process waters are directly discharged from the plant site. Operating in a semiarid region with a limited water supply, engineers developed a recycling system to reduce water use at Plant X. A pipeline was constructed to send Plant X blowdown water (used water from plant operations) for treatment and recycling at the nearby Tolk Station, a coal-fired power plant located to the west. As a result, the combined water consumption of Plant X and Tolk Station was reduced by about 180 million gallons per year. Nevertheless, Plant X still \\"consumes huge quantities of groundwater.\\"Brune, G.M. 1981. Springs of Texas. Fort Worth, TX: Branch-Smith, p. 284. The generation of steam, the discharge of steam to the atmosphere, and the evaporation of water from massive cooling towers results in a significant extraction of groundwater from the Ogallala Aquifer. The combination of groundwater pumping for power production and water extraction by irrigated agriculture has caused groundwater levels beneath the Sand Hills to drop appreciably. As a result, most natural springs in the area have stopped flowing and spring-fed lakes, such as Spring Lake and Soda Lake, have dried completely.

In his youth he was a Radical reformer, but in later life he moved to the political right to become an Ultra-Tory. Early life and family Spooner was born at Birches Green, Erdington, and was the son of Isaac Spooner, a banker and magistrate in nearby Birmingham. Following education at Rugby School, he joined a banking company, where he was in partnership with Thomas Attwood. In 1804 he married Charlotte Wetherell, daughter of Nathan Wetherell, the Dean of Hereford. He was involved in the civic life of Birmingham, helping to found the Mechanics Institute in 1820, of which he was the first president. Radical politics In 1812 Spooner and Attwood led a campaign to repeal the orders in council introduced in 1807 as part of the government's campaign of economic warfare against France. The orders, which severely effected the trade of Birmingham were repealed later in the year. In March 1820 he contested the general election at Boroughbridge, Yorkshire. The constituency was a two-seat \\"pocket borough\\" in the hands of the Dukes of Newcastle, who supported the Tory candidates. However, Spooner, running as a Radical, and Marmaduke Lawson, a Whig were elected. Three months later, the Tories managed to have the election of both MPs overturned on petition. In 1826 Spooner again stood for parliament at Warwickshire. While he had overwhelming support from the voters of Birmingham, he was unsuccessful. In December of the same year a parliamentary vacancy was caused, when Richard Ironmonger MP for Stafford died. Spooner was chosen as the Radical candidate to contest the ensuing by-election, but was defeated in a straight fight by the Whig, Thomas Beaumont. He was expected to contest the seat again at the next general election in 1830. Instead he stood at Coventry, where his colleague Attwood had been requested to stand, but had declined. Once again, he failed to be elected. Move to the Tories By 1832 Spooner's repeated electoral defeats led to his moving away from Radical politics. In that year he was asked to join the Birmingham Political Union, but declined the invitation. By the time of the 1835 general election he had made a complete change in his political views. The Birmingham Daily Post described his conversion: > \\"...from having been a bold and uncompromising Liberal, became ultimately > one of the most determined, immovable and obstructive members of the ultra- > Tory party.\\" Member of parliament for Birmingham In 1835 and 1841 Spooner stood as the Tory candidate against Birmingham's sitting Radical MPs. He was heavily defeated on both occasions. In 1844, Joshua Scholefield, one of the town's members of parliament, died. Consequently, a by-election was held. Spooner was again the Tory candidate and was opposed by William Scholefield, son of the deceased MP, who was expected to hold the seat for the Radicals. However, the Liberal/Radical vote was split when a third candidate, Joseph Sturge, entered the contest. Spooner was elected \\"most likely to his own astonishment\\" as the first Tory MP for Birmingham. It was noted that the \\"personal liking felt for the man was temporarily permitted to outweigh the general resentment at his political apostasy\\". At the next general election in 1847 the Liberals were reunited, and Spooner lost the seat to William Scholefield. Member of parliament for North Warwickshire Having lost his seat at Birmingham in July 1847, Spooner was immediately nominated as a Conservative candidate for the two-member Northern Division of Warwickshire where polling was not held until August. On 16 August he was duly declared elected, along with his party colleague, Charles Newdigate Newdegate. He held the seat at the general elections of 1852, 1857 and 1859. Spooner was a member of the \\"Ultra\\" faction of the Tories. He was a proponent of protectionism and a strong Anglican, opposing any measures of relief to Roman Catholics, \\"Dissenters\\" or Jews. In his later years he was considered a figure of fun, with his annual (and barely audible) speech denouncing the renewal of the grant to Maynooth Seminary treated with derision. In his obituary his later parliamentary contributions were summarised: > \\"...every proposal which in his early life would have elicited his most > strenuous approval, received in his old age his most vehement opposition\\". In 1862 he became unwell, and ceased attending the Commons. He delayed his resignation as the local Conservative organisation had no agreed candidate in the event of a vacancy. He lived in virtual retirement at Henwood Lodge, Leamington Spa, where he died in November 1864. He was buried in the family vault at Elmdon.

Eyes of Blue In 1966 Ryan and Hopkins - together with the drummer John Weathers - joined The Eyes of Blue, who then turned professional.

The Eyes moved from Decca to Mercury Records and recorded their first album Crossroads of Time in 1968, which was produced by Lou Reizner. The album included two tracks written by Graham Bond \\"Crossroads of Time\\" and \\"Love is the Law\\", who was a major influence on Ryan. and who also wrote the album sleeve notes.

The Eyes of Blue's third and final album, Bluebell Wood, was released under the pseudonym Big Sleep, and the band broke up shortly afterwards. In 1970 Ryan and Weathers joined Pete Brown & Piblokto! playing on one single, \\"Flying Hero Sandwich\\" / \\"My Last Band\\". When bassist Steve Glover broke his wrist, he was replaced by Michael \\"Will\\" Youatt,Sleeve notes by Michael Heatley to CD reissue of Black Hole Star/Tales From The Blue Cocoons and when Piblokto disbanded Ryan and Youatt, together with Clive John, who had just left Man, formed the first incarnation of Iorworth Pritchard and the Neutrons.

Neutrons Ryan and Youatt left Man in 1973 to re-form the Neutrons. Andrew Lauder, head of A&R; at United Artists put the duo in Rockfield Studios where they began recording the first Neutrons album, Black Hole Star. To record the album, Ryan and Youatt assembled several friends and former bandmates, including drummers John \\"Pugwash\\" Weathers (then with Gentle Giant) and Dave Charles; guitarists Martin Wallace and Ray \\"Taff\\" Williams, who had been in Eyes of Blue and Piblokto!, violinist Stuart Gordon (ex Incredible String Band) and vocalist Caromay Dixon.Dutch Progressive Rock Pages on Neutrons written by Nigel Camilleri Retrieved 7 February 2010 The initial recordings were made at Rockfield Studios - \\"Snow Covered Eyes\\" and \\"Living In The World Today\\". The rest of the album was recorded in April 1974 at Chipping Norton Recording Studios. Released in September 1974 Black Hole Star featured Neutrons' logo, designed by Rick Griffin, whilst the track \\"Mermaid And Chips\\" features the lyrics of Pete Brown. The album spawned one single \\"Dance of the Psychedelic Lounge Lizard\\"/\\"Suzy and the Wonder Boy\\", The A-side being dedicated to Graham Bond, whilst the B side was not on the album, although it features Dave Edmunds on slide guitar. The second album Tales From The Blue Cocoons was released in April 1975. The performers were similar to the first album, except Weathers was replaced by Stuart Halliday and Stuart Gordon did not play. Ryan and Youatt were having musical differences, so, unlike the first album, none of the tracks on the second were jointly written by the pair, whilst the uncredited \\"Welsh R Blunt\\" dates from when Ryan was in Piblokto! and had also been played, but not recorded, by Man. Neutrons toured to promote the album, but Taff Williams left shortly after the start of the tour, so former Help Yourself guitarist Richard Treece stood in, but Neutrons had disbanded by July 1975. Man again Ryan played on Clive John's solo album You Always Know Where You Stand With a Buzzard, and briefly started a solo project Road of Cobras, before rejoining Man in September 1975, along with bassist John McKenzie. One of the Road of Cobras tracks \\"Something is Happening\\" ended up on the next Man album The Welsh Connection which reached No 40 in the UK Album Chart. Towards the end of the US tour to promote the album, Man's manager, Barrie Marshall, announced that he would be discontinuing his role as the band's manager, and adopting all rights to the name Man. On the farewell tour of Europe, differences arose amongst the band who agreed to call it a day. The MCA record deal was for 3 albums, but MCA eventually agreed to a live farewell album, All's Well That Ends Well recorded at the Roundhouse on 11‚Äì13 December, although the final gig was in Slough on 16 December 1976.

The stemless sponge-like species, first described in 2009, was found in Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, where it grows in soil in old-growth forests. The rubbery fruit body, which has a strong odor of coal- tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum, consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore-producing tissue. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the species is closely related to the Boletaceae genera Porphyrellus and Strobilomyces. Taxonomy and phylogeny The species was first described scientifically in 2009 by E. Horak, T. Flegel and D.E. Desjardin, based on specimens collected in July 2002 in Khao Yai National Park, central Thailand, and roughly three years later in the same location. Prior to this, the species had been mentioned in a 2001 Thai publication as an unidentified species of Hymenogaster. Phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences shows that Spongiforma is sister (sharing a common ancestor) to the genus Porphyrellus. The next most closely related genus is Strobilomyces. All three genera are members of the family Boletaceae, and in the Boletineae, one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder. The genus name Spongiforma refers to the sponge-like nature of the fruit body, while the specific epithet thailandica denotes the country in which the species is found. Description The fruit body of Spongiforma thailandica is relatively large, up to in diameter by tall, and pale brownish gray to brown or reddish brown. It is sponge-like and rubbery‚Äîif water is squeezed out it will assume its original shape. The surface has irregular, relatively large cavities (locules), in diameter, lined with fertile (spore-producing) tissue. The mushrooms do not have a stem, but rather a columella‚Äîa small internal structure at the base of the fruit body, resembling a column, extending up into the fruit body. The columella has dimensions of 10‚Äì15 mm tall by 8‚Äì10 mm diameter (at the apex) by 3‚Äì4 mm (at the base), and it is attached to copious, fine white rhizomorphs. Fruit bodies have a strong odor of coal tar or burnt rubber (likened to Tricholoma sulphureum). The mushroom tissue turns purple when a drop of 3‚Äì10% potassium hydroxide is applied. In mass, the spores appear to be brown to reddish-brown in color. Viewed with a microscope, they are amygdaliform (almond-shaped), and typically measure 10‚Äì11.5 by 5.5‚Äì7 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to roughly club-shaped, four-spored, with dimensions of 25‚Äì32 by 6.5‚Äì9.5 Œºm. They have straight sterigmata (slender extensions that attach to the spores) up to 9.5 Œºm long. The cystidia (large, sterile cells in the hymenium) are cylindrical to roughly club-shaped, thin-walled, and measure 25‚Äì48 by 5‚Äì10 Œºm. They are inamyloid, meaning they will not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The cystidia are plentiful on the edges of the locules, and occasional among the basidia. The hymenophore is made of interwoven branched hyphae that are arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. These thin-walled cylindrical hyphae have inflated septa (intracellular partitions), and are gelatinous, hyaline (translucent) and inamyloid. The subhymenium (the tissue layer immediately under the hymenium) is made of inflated hyphae that are hyaline, inamyloid, thin-walled, and non-gelatinous, measuring 9‚Äì20 by 9‚Äì14 Œºm. The fruit bodies vaguely resemble those of the species Gymnopaxillus nudus, found in Australia growing in association with Eucalyptus. However, Gymnopaxillus fruit bodies grow underground, lack a strong odor, do not stain purple with potassium hydroxide, and have longer spores, typically 11‚Äì16 ¬µm. Habitat and distribution Khao Yai forests of central Thailand Spongiforma thailandica was found growing on the ground in an old growth forest in Khao Yai National Park (Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand), at an elevation of about . The fungus is thought to grow in a mycorrhizal association with Shorea henryana and Dipterocarpus gracilis.

With of the closing of Northwest Plaza in St. Ann in 2010, Chesterfield Mall became the largest shopping mall in the St. Louis metropolitan area. History The mall opened in 1976 as the sister mall to Jamestown Mall. The malls original two anchor stores were Sears and Stix, Baer, and Fuller. In 1978, a 4-screen cinema opened at the mall. In 1981, a Famous-Barr store opened at the mall. In 1984, Dillard's replaced Stix, Baer, and Fuller. In 1995, a new Famous-Barr store was built adjacent to the former space, which JCPenney would later take over. The mall received a renovation in 1996. In 2000, the 4-screen cinema closed. In 2005, the JCPenney store closed and the space was demolished, which made way for many smaller shops and restaurants, including Borders (currently V-Stock), The Cheesecake Factory, an American Girl store (closed as of 2018), a food court, and a 14-screen AMC Megaplex, which took up a new third floor. The mall was bought by Hull Property Group in 2018, after a (reverse) progression of ownership by CBL & Associates Properties (from 2007), the Westfield Group (from 2002), and Richard E. Jacobs Group initially. The mall was placed in receivership in the third quarter of 2016, pending foreclosure, with management transferred to Madison Marquette while a new owner was sought. The foreclosure finalized in June 2017, making C-III Capital Partners the temporary owner. The mall's anchor stores, though attached to the mall, are owned separately.

Anchor store Dillard's closed in September 2016 due to flooding following a water main break; the store was expected to reopen in 2017, but in early 2018 the company announced the location would remain closed. In March 2018, the St. Louis area's only American Girl store, which was inside the mall, closed. On May 31, 2018, it was announced Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 72 stores nationwide, which also included nearby mall South County Center. The store closed in September 2018, leaving Macy's as the last remaining anchor store. In late 2018, the AMC cinema was downgraded to an AMC Classic.

Origins Until the early 19th century, the usual method of producing wrought iron involved a charcoal-fired finery in a finery forge. In the beginning of the 19th century this became an obsolete process and was slowly replaced by the coal-fueled puddling process. However, charcoal continued to be used in some forges after most of the iron industry had abandoned it for coke.R. Hayman, 'Charcoal ironmaking in nineteenth-century Shropshire' Economic History Review 61 (2008), 80-98. In 1813 when John Bradley & Co. (whose leading partner was James Foster) took over forges at Eardington in Shropshire, a potting and stamping forge, they reverted to using charcoal. In 1820, he bought Hampton Loade Forge, which then became a tinplate works and in 1826 another charcoal forge. This was followed by other charcoal forges at Horsehay in 1832 and at the Old Park ironworks of the Botfield family about 1826. Cookley Forge in the Stour valley also reverted to charcoal working in 1814, supplying wire and tinplate mills. By the 1830s, these forges were sometimes producing over 2000 tons of iron per year, compared with a few hundred from earlier finery forges. It is likely that these forges were using a more efficient variety of hearth, which from Swedish usage has come to be known as a Lancashire hearth. Spread Faced with competition from cheaper British iron production, the Swedish iron industry needed to find a new cheaper method of making iron. In the 1810s, experiments were made with puddling, but this proved unsatisfactory, as it needed coal of which Sweden had none. After Gustav Ekman visited Britain, he published a report of his observations. He had seen closed finery hearths in south Wales and near Ulverston, then in Lancashire (now Cumbria). Those in south Wales were similar to puddling furnaces, but in Lancashire, he saw closed furnaces, where the metal was in contact with the fuel. On his return to Sweden, Ekman experimented and built furnaces similar to what he had seen near Ulverston,A. den Ouden, 'The production of wrought iron in finery hearths: part I The finery process and its development' Historical Metallurgy 15(2) (1981), 63-88. most probably at Newland ironworks. In 1829-30, Waern installed a furnace of the south Wales type at Backefors ironworks, while independently Ekman built Lancashire hearths at Dormsj√∂ and S√∂derfors. From there the process spread to other forges. In 1887, 406 hearths made 210,500 tons of iron. The last Lancashire forge in Sweden was at Ramn√§s, closed in 1964.G. Ryden, 'Responses to coal technology without coal: Swedish iron making in the nineteenth century' in C. Evans and G. Ryden, The Industrial Revolution in Iron: the impact of British coal technology in nineteenth-century Europe (Ashgate, Aldershot 1005), 121-7. In Shropshire, charcoal iron production continued on a significant scale, but declined after 1870, rods for wire-drawing being a significant product. However most charcoal forges were probably closed by 1890. Process The Swedish Lancashire hearth consisted of a rectangular closed furnace with a chimney (8 metres high) at one end and a working arch in front of the hearth proper at the other. Pig iron was charged through a door at the foot of the chimney and stacked on an iron-clad bridge so that it could be heated by the waste gases from the hearth. The hearth was blown through a single water-cooled tuyere with pre- heated air. The hearth consisted of a rectangular box of iron plates, the bottom plate being water-cooled. Surplus slag was removed with a shovel between finings, but some was left to help the process. Pig stacked on the bridge at the back of the hearth was then pulled forward with a hook and charcoal added. The blast was then turned on and fining began. When the pigs began to melt, rabelling began (as in the Walloon process) using two bars of iron one to stir the iron and the other to lift it back into the blast. Periodically the tuyere had to be cleaned of matter adhering to it with a third bar. Finally, the iron was gathered into a 'loop' which was lifted out of the hearth with a heavier bar and tongs, and taken to the shingling hammer. The process was more fuel-efficient and more productive than its predecessors.

He became a wealthy man by the time he was forty years old. Biography He was born February 14, 1864 in Philadelphia, as a son of a respected doctor, Charles Pendleton Tutt, and Rebecca (n√©e Leaming). His father died of typhus when the boy was two years old. The Tutt ancestors had immigrated from England. One ancestor had served as Lord Mayor of London and another was a member of General George Washington's staff during the American Revolutionary War. Tutt attended the Protestant Episcopal Academy, where he met Spencer Penrose, nicknamed \\"Speck\\", and the two became friends. Both of their fathers had worked at the Children's Hospital. Penrose, one of six sons in a well-to-do Philadelphia family, attended Harvard University. Tutt's family struggled after his father's death, and the youth quit school at an early age. He began work as a clerk for the Pennsylvania Railroad to help support his family. He migrated west, landing in North Platte, Nebraska, where he lost $500 in a business venture. He moved to Black Forest, El Paso County, Colorado, where he bought a cattle ranch in 1884. In 1885, Tutt sold two cows to earn the return fare to Philadelphia. He married his fiancee Josephine Thayer on 29 December 1885, daughter of Martin Russell Thayer and his wife. Her father was a jurist who had served in President Abraham Lincoln's administration. She returned with him to Colorado. A year after moving to the Black Forest ranch, Josephine convinced her husband to sell out and move to Colorado Springs to start a real estate and insurance business. Together they had four children, but three died young. Their son Charles L. Tutt Jr. (January 9, 1889-November 1, 1961) was the only one to survive into adulthood. Colorado Springs The Tutt family lived at 611 North Weber Street. They had a two-story gingerbread house, with a combination barn and buggy shed in the rear. Tutt's one-room business office was at 14 East Pikes Peak Avenue in the city. After opening a branch office in Pueblo, Colorado, in 1889, Tutt visited Cripple Creek, walked up \\"Poverty Gulch,\\" and stake a gold mining claim. Once the claim was staked, a prospector with half interest in the mine, sold his half interest to Tutt for $50. Tutt owned the\\"Cash on Delivery\\" (C.O.D.), but had no money to develop it. Tutt, together with C. Findley and A. Carlton, all big players in the future of the mining district at Cripple Creek, set up the C.O.D. Gold Mining Company, incorporated on February 26, 1892, as a Colorado corporation. Later that year, geologist Richard Penrose, his friend Spencer's brother, travelled through Colorado Springs, where he met with Tutt. He asked him to write to Spencer and encourage him to relocate to Colorado Springs for its business opportunities. Mining business Spencer Penrose, who had already mined for gold in Mexico, received a letter from Tutt in 1892 extolling the virtues of Colorado Springs. Although the two men had not seen each other for at least 10 years, Penrose took the chance on gold mining and arrived in Colorado Springs by train December 10, 1892. Two days later, Tutt offered Penrose half interest in his real estate business for $500, as well as 1/16 interest in the \\"C.O.D.\\" mine in return for raising $10,000 to pay miners and buy equipment. A gold vein was discovered in the mine. In 1894, Charles sold the C.O.D. mine for $250,000. He and Penrose decided to go into another business together. They learned that milling ore was a better way to make money that mining ore. Along with engineer Charles M. MacNeill, they started the Colorado-Philadelphia Reduction Company and did very well with this business. The company operated a barrel- chlorinating ore mill at Colorado City. Charles M. MacNeill had already experience in running a barrel-chlorinating ore mill, since MacNeill, Captain De Lamar, George W. Peirce (of the Golden Fleece Mine (Colorado)), and some other mining men, owned interest in a barrel-chlorinating plant mill at Lawrence, the first in Colorado. It burned down in 1895. Tutt and Penrose explored mining for copper, learning of a major deposit in the Bingham Valley, Utah. They, Daniel C. Jackling, and some other men, organized the Utah Copper Company in 1903 to mine there. Their open pit copper mine was the richest in the country. Revenues from this mine made both men millionaires. Tutt did much to help plan and develop the city of Colorado Springs. Furthering their partnership, he and Penrose arranged to construct a road to the top of Pikes Peak, to stimulate the tourist trade. They also organized an annual motor car race to the top.Thomas J. Noel and Cathleen M. Norman: A Pikes Peak Partnership: The Penroses and the Tutts. Boulder: University Press of Colorado, 2001 Tutt died young at age 45, on 21 January 1909, at the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel, New York City. His son Charles L. Tutt Jr. (and grandsons) carried on his legacy. They contributed much to the city of Colorado Springs and to Colorado College. In 1918 Penrose had his grand opening for The Broadmoor hotel and resort outside Colorado Springs. After his death in 1939, Tutt's son, Charles L. Tutt Jr., served as the hotel's president and helped guide its expansion. References External links *An account of his life,by Joan E.

He was a second cousin of the renowned poet Bai Juyi.  Background and early career  Bai Minzhong was born in 792, during the reign of Emperor Dezong. His family was originally from Taiyuan.Old Book of Tang, vol. 166. The family traced its ancestry to the great Qin general Bai Qi, but the traceable parts of the ancestry went back to the Northern Zhou official Bai Jian ().New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Bai Minzhong's grandfather Bai Lin () served as an officer at Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), while his father Bai Jikang () served as a county magistrate. Bai Lin and the great poet Bai Juyi's grandfather Bai Huang () were sons of Bai Wen (), making Bai Minzhong and Bai Juyi, who was older than Bai Minzhong, second cousins.That Bai Lin's name used the character Èèª is according to the Old Book of Tang. The table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang gave the character as ÊΩæ, but which appeared to be erroneous because ÊΩæ's use of the water radical (Ê∞¥) would be incongruous with both Bai Wen's name (which also carried the water radical) and Bai Huang's name (which, like Èèª, carried the metal radical (Èáë)). See New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Bai Minzhong lost his father early, and he apparently was effectively raised by his older brothers or cousins. Early in the Changqing era (821-824) of Emperor Dezong's great-grandson Emperor Muzong, he passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class, and he subsequently served on the staff of the general Li Ting (), while Li Ting served three terms as circuit military governor (Jiedushi). He later served as Dali Pingshi (), a judge at the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫, Dali Si). In 833, during the reign of Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Wenzong, when Bai's mother died, he left governmental service and took up resident at Xiagui (‰∏ãÈÇΩ, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi).  During Emperor Wuzong's reign  Early in the Huichang era (841-846) of Emperor Wenzong's brother Emperor Wuzong, Bai Minzhong returned to governmental service to serve as an imperial censor with the title Dianzhong Shiyushi (), with his office at the eastern capital Luoyang. Soon thereafter, he was recalled to Chang'an to serve as Hubu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu). At that time, Li Deyu was the leading chancellor. Emperor Wuzong had long admired Bai Juyi and wanted to make Bai Juyi a chancellor, and he requested Li Deyu's opinion. Li Deyu had long disliked Bai Juyi, and therefore argued that Bai Juyi was old and ill, and thus unsuitable to bear the chancellor responsibilities; instead, he recommended Bai Minzhong, arguing that Bai Minzhong was just as talented in literature as Bai Juyi and also was good understanding of governance. In 842, therefore, Emperor Wuzong made Bai Minzhong an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246. He was later made Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), and yet later made the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang) as well as chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´ÊâøÊó®, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi).  During Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign  Shortly after Emperor Wuzong's death in 846 and succession by his uncle Emperor XuƒÅnzong, Bai Minzhong was made a chancellor de facto with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248. He was also created the Duke of Taiyuan. Soon thereafter, Emperor XuƒÅnzong, who had long despised Li Deyu's hold on power, demoted him out of the capital. It was said that Bai took this opportunity to seek out evidence of Li Deyu's guilt while Li Deyu served as chancellor, and in 847, as a result, Li Deyu was demoted from being the defender of Luoyang to the title of advisor to the Crown Prince ‚Äî an entirely honorary post as there was no crown prince at the time ‚Äî with his office at Luoyang. It was also said that, with Bai as the leading chancellor, officials that Li Deyu had long refused to promote were being promoted, including Ma Zhi, Cui Yuanshi, and Wei Cong. At Emperor XuƒÅnzong's prompting (as Emperor XuƒÅnzong remembered the deceased official Linghu Chu), Bai also recommended Linghu's son Linghu Tao. In 848, Grand Empress Dowager Guo ‚Äî the wife of Emperor Muzong's and Emperor XuƒÅnzong's father Emperor Xianzong ‚Äî died. Because Emperor XuƒÅnzong's mother Empress Dowager Zheng was still alive and, having served as Grand Empress Dowager Guo's servant girl previously and having resented her, Bai, in order to please Emperor XuƒÅnzong, advocated that Grand Empress Dowager Guo not be buried with Emperor Xianzong and not be worshipped at his temple. When the official Wang Hao () objected, Wang offended both Emperor XuƒÅnzong and Bai and was demoted. Grand Empress Dowager Guo was subsequently buried at Emperor Xianzong's tomb, but not worshipped at his temple. In 850, in addition to his responsibilities as chancellor, Bai was put in charge of the imperial reserve that Emperor XuƒÅnzong had set aside for border defenses.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249. In 851, when Emperor XuƒÅnzong was becoming weary of repeated Dangxiang rebellions in the northwestern regions, Bai's fellow chancellor Cui Xuan suggested that a senior official be commissioned to oversee the operations against the Dangxiang. Emperor XuƒÅnzong thus made Bai the military governor of Binning Circuit (ÈÇ†ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and the supreme commander of the operations against the Dangxiang. At Bai's request, citing the example of Pei Du, Bai was allowed to retain a number of talented imperial government officials to serve on his staff. However, he was concerned that once he left Chang'an, the imperial scholar Zheng Hao (), the husband of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's daughter Princess Wanshou, would defame him. (Previously, Zheng had contracted to marry a woman from one of the most honored clans at that time, the Lu clan, when Bai, in response to Emperor XuƒÅnzong's question as to who could make an appropriate husband for Princess Wanshou, recommended Zheng. Zheng, who had departed Chang'an to marry Lady Lu, was subsequently summoned back to the capital and required to marry Princess Wanshou. As Zheng did not want to marry Princess Wanshou, he resented Bai from this point on.) Emperor XuƒÅnzong, to allay his concerns, gave him a small wooden box containing accusations that Zheng had already submitted against Bai and pointed out that if he had believed Zheng, Bai would not have remained in power; it was said that Bai took the box home and offered incense to it in gratitude. Later in the year, Bai reported that the Dangxiang rebels had all agreed to submit, and at his request, Emperor XuƒÅnzong issued a general pardon for the Dangxiang. Emperor XuƒÅnzong subsequently relieved him of the title of supreme commander of the forces against Dangxiang (as unnecessary), and kept him at Binning Circuit as its military governor, allowing him to retain the title of chancellor and that of Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) as honorary titles. In 852, Bai was transferred to Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), and also served as the mayor of its capital Chengdu Municipality. In 857, he was transferred to Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), and also served as the mayor of its capital Jiangling Municipality ().  During Emperor Yizong's reign  Emperor XuƒÅnzong died in 859 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Yizong. In the aftermaths of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's death, Linghu Tao, who had dominated the court scene after Bai Minzhong's departure from Chang'an, was attacked by many others for alleged abuses of power. As a result, Emperor Yizong sent Linghu out of the capital and recalled Bai to Chang'an to serve as chancellor, with the titles of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi, Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé, the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng)), and Situ (Âè∏Âæí, also one of the Three Excellencies). He arrived in Chang'an early in 860, but subsequently suffered a waist injury when he fell while climbing up the stairs at the imperial hall, and he had to be taken home in a litter. Over the next several months, Bai submitted repeated petitions to resign, which Emperor Yizong did not accept. The advisory official Wang Pu () subsequently submitted a petition arguing that Bai's injury made it inappropriate for him to remain chancellor ‚Äî implying that Bai's resignations were not sincere. This offended Bai, and subsequently Emperor Yizong demoted Wang, and the other chancellors upheld the demotion due to Wang's offense against Bai, despite objections by the imperial attendant Zheng Gongyu (). Later in the year, after Bai submitted a fifth petition to resign, Emperor Yizong granted him the even greater chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§, head of the legislative bureau) as well as Situ.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. In 861, with the southwestern circuits under attack from Nanzhao, Emperor Yizong convened an imperial meeting to discuss responses, and Bai attended the meeting, with imperial guard soldiers assisting him in getting into the imperial hall. Thereafter, Emperor Yizong finally removed him from the post of chancellor, and made him the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), allowing him to retain the Zhongshu Ling title as an honorary title. He subsequently made further attempts to resign, and he was made the defender of Luoyang, but he declined to report to that post, and was allowed to retire with the honorary title of Taifu (). Before the edict permitting the retirement arrived, though, he died in 862.New Book of Tang, vol. 119. He was given posthumous honors, although the ceremonial scholar Cao Ye (), arguing that Bai had not sincerely yielded the chancellor post after becoming ill and had instigated Wang's exile, gave him the unflattering posthumous name of Chou (ÈÜú, \\"abusive\\").

The galaxy is located at the distance of about 44 kpc from the Sun and moves away from the Sun with the velocity of about 98 km/s. It is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) meaning that it has an elliptical (ratio of axes ~ 5:3) shape with the half-light radius of about 70 pc. Com is one of the smallest and faintest satellites of the Milky Way‚Äîits integrated luminosity is about times that of the Sun (absolute visible magnitude of about ‚àí4.1), which is much lower than the luminosity of the majority of globular clusters. However, its mass is about 1.2 million solar masses, which means that galaxy's mass to light ratio is around 450. A high mass to light ratio implies that Com is dominated by the dark matter. The stellar population of Com consists mainly of old stars formed more than 12 billion years ago. The metallicity of these old stars is also very low at , which means that they contain 350 times less heavy elements than the Sun. The stars of Com were probably among the first stars to form in the Universe and currently there is no star formation in Com. The measurements have so far failed to detect any neutral hydrogen in it‚Äîthe upper limit is only 46 solar masses.

He participated in the Norwegian Campaign in Northern Norway during the Second World War as the chief-of-staff, under general Fleischer. He spent most of the war in Norwegian and German concentration camps. He continued his military career after the war, eventually with the rank of major general and military attach√© in Stockholm. He wrote several books on Norwegian military history. Early and personal life Lindb√§ck-Larsen was born in Kristiania as the son of Ludvig Martinius Larsen and Fanny Olivia Lindb√§ck. He graduated from Oslo Cathedral School in 1915, from the Norwegian Military Academy in 1918, and from the Norwegian Military College in 1921. He was a candidate at the general staff () from 1922 to 1926, and adjoint from 1929 to 1933. He resided in Finland for the purpose of studies in 1926, and in Germany in 1933. He married telegraph operator Dagny Kaspara Lund on 25 July 1927. His son, Tore Lindbekk (b. 1933), is a sociologist and politician. Career Pre-war Lindb√§ck-Larsen was a military attach√© in Helsinki from 1934 to 1936. From 1936 he was the chief-of- staff at the 6th Division in Northern Norway. Second World War Norwegian Campaign and aftermath Lindb√§ck-Larsen participated in the Norwegian Campaign in Northern Norway during the Second World War as the chief-of-staff and right-hand man of General Carl Gustav Fleischer, the commander of the 6th Division. Following the conclusion of the campaign on 10 June 1940 and the departure to exile in the United Kingdom of General Carl Gustav Fleischer, Lindb√§ck-Larsen became the military chief-of-staff of Finnmark County Governor Hans Gabrielsen. In this respect Lindb√§ck-Larsen commanded a Norwegian border guard force of two infantry battalions and an artillery battery. The border forces had been allowed by the Germans in the capitulation agreement to remain stationed in Eastern Finnmark as a safe-guard against the Soviet Union after the Norwegian capitulation. Plans were made by General Otto Ruge to use the 1,600‚Äì1,700 men strong border guard to rebuild a Norwegian elite army in Finnmark, outside of German control. The border guard was however ordered to be dissolved by the Germans in July 1940. Imprisonment Lindb√§ck-Larsen was arrested by the Germans in November 1940 and incarcerated for the rest of the war, first at M√∏llergata 19 prison, then at Grini concentration camp, and finally at Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany. Lindb√§ck-Larsen was never convicted of anything and was referred to by the Germans as Reichskommissar Josef Terboven's personal prisoner, the two having clashed before Lindb√§ck-Larsen's arrest. Post- war After the war he continued his military career. From 1946 to 1952 he was in charge of Agder Infantry Regiment. From 1952 he held the rank of Major General and was the commander-in-chief of District Command North Norway. From 1958 to 1962 he was a military attach√© in Stockholm. He was decorated Commander with Star of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1958.

It shows a woman commonly identified as Goya's maid, companion and, most likely lover, Leocadia Weiss. She is dressed in a dark, almost funeral maja dress, and leans against what is either a mantelpiece or burial mound, as she looks outward at the viewer with a sorrowful expression. Leocadia is one of the final of the Black Paintings, which he painted in his seventies at a time when he was consumed by political, physical and psychological turmoil, after he fled to the country from his position as court painter in Madrid. According to the c. 1828‚Äì1830 inventory of his friend Antonio Brugada, Leocadia was situated in the ground floor of Quinta del Sordo, Goya's villaJunquera (2008), pp. 33, 42 which Lawrence Gowing observes was thematically divided: a male side of Saturn Devouring His Son and A Pilgrimage to San Isidro; and a female side compromising Judith and Holofernes, Witches' Sabbath, and Leocadia.Junquera (2008), p. 60The male/female counterpoint can be further seen between individual works in the series, most especially between Men Reading and Man Mocked by Two Women. See Licht (1979) p. 167 All the works in the series were transferred to canvas after Goya's death and are now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Background Quinta del Sordo, c. 1900 In 1819, Goya purchased the Quinta del Sordo (\\"Villa of the Deaf Man\\") situated on the banks of the Manzanares near Madrid. This small two-story house was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf,Connell (2004), p. 204 though Goya himself, by coincidence, had been functionally deaf for more than two decades, the result of an illness contracted in 1792.Heselwood (2011), p. 27 At the age of 73, and having survived two life-threatening illnesses, Goya was concerned with his mortality, and increasingly embittered by the conflicts that engulfed Spain in the decade preceding his move to the Quinta del Sordo, and the developing Spanish Civil War of 1820‚Äì1823 and the civil strife ‚Äî indeed, Goya was completing the plates that formed his series The Disasters of War during this period. Between 1819 and 1823, before he moved to Bordeaux in 1824, he produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of his Spanish house. Although he first decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images, in time he painted over them with the intense and haunted pictures known today as the Black Paintings ‚Äî one of which was the portrait of Leocadia. Uncommissioned and never meant for public display, these pictures reflect his darkening mood, with their depictions of intense scenes of malevolence, conflict and despair. If Goya gave titles to the works he produced at the Quinta del Sordo, he never revealed what they were; the names by which they are now known were assigned by others after his death, and the paintings are often identified by variations on the common title. Goya left Spain and Quinta del Sordo in 1824 for exile in France, where he was joined by his housekeeper Leocadia Weiss and her ten-year-old daughter, Rosario, possibly Goya's child. Description The Milkmaid of Bordeaux, 1825‚Äì1827, is the third and final Goya portrait which may depict Leocadia Weiss. This might also be of Leocadia's daughter Rosario.Hughes (2004), p, 402 Its colourisation and mood is very similar to the Leocadia Black Painting The painting's funereal air is established through the shading of the gray background, the colouring of the model's black veil and maja dress, and her sad or nostalgic expression. She is positioned before an open blue sky, with her body slightly leaning against a rock or mound. The mound is topped by a row of small wrought iron rails; some critics have suggested it may represent a burial mound. X-ray shows that the mound may originally have been painted as an open fireplace and the veil a later addition. Leocadia's head rests on her forearm as she looks thoughtfully towards the viewer and is portrayed in a sympathetic manner. The work is illuminated by a yellow light falling on her face, arm and chest. The background shows a blue and white sky emitting an ocher yellowish noon-light reminiscent of one of his final works, The Milkmaid of Bordeaux. The painting contains a sense of peace and air of reconciliation absent in the other works from the series.Buchholz (1999), p. 79 Writer Juan Jos√© Junquera wrote that the work may represent a personification of Melancholy, or given the relationship between artist and model, \\"the symbol of the fire of love and of the home and the presentiment of coming death\\". According to Robert Havard, her confident stare and maja dress may be indications of the earlier charge against her of adultery. Leocadia Weiss The picture probably depicts Leocadia Weiss (n√©e Zorrilla,Junquera (2008), p. 13 1788‚Äì1856)Stevenson (2009), p. 243 the artist's maid, younger by 35 years, and distant relative,Gassier (1955), p. 103 though this identity has been contested. As with any of the paintings from the series, the current title was not Goya's own, and he never mentioned or wrote about any of the Black Paintings. Leocadia was probably similar in features to Goya's first wife Josefa Bayeu, to the extent that one of his well-known portraits bears the cautious title of Josefa Bayeu (or Leocadia Weiss).Connell (2004), p. 28 While Junquera describes the identification of Leocadia as \\"more romantic ... than a certainty\\",Junquera (2008), p. 68 the work bears strong resemblance to a Goya portrait more or less accepted to be of her, and which was left in her possession following his death. Francisco Goya, It is not known whether this 1805 Goya portrait is of his wife Josefa Bayeu or mistress Leocadia Weiss. Leocadia, with her daughter Rosario, lived with and cared for Goya after Bayeu's death. She stayed with him in his Quinta del Sordo villa until 1824. Sometime in 1824 Goya lost faith in, or became threatened by, the restored Spanish monarchy's anti-liberal political and social stance, and abandoned Spain to live in France, until his death 1828. Leocadia followed him with Rosario and stayed until his death. Not much is known about her beyond that she had a fiery temperament. It is known that Leocadia had an unhappy marriage with a jeweler, Isidore Weiss, but had been separated from him since 1811, after he had accused her of \\"illicit conduct\\". She had two children before that time, and bore a third, Rosario, in 1814 when she was 26. Isidore was not the father, and it has often been speculated ‚Äì although with little firm evidence ‚Äì that the child belonged to Goya.Hughes (2004), p. 372 There has been much speculation that Goya and Weiss were romantically linked, and that in this work, she is shown as his widow mourning at his tomb. Others believe the affection between them was platonic and sentimental. From her representations it has been assumed that she was striking looking ‚Äì if not pretty ‚Äì and probably in her early 30s at the time of this portrait. She had a strong fiery character; based on Goya's letters, her manner often upset him. Despite the sentiment expressed in a letter in which Goya sent her \\"a thousand kisses and a thousand things\\", Leocadia was left nothing in his will. Mistresses were often omitted in such circumstances. His son Javier, who inherited a large amount of his father's inventory and unsold paintings, but had refused to visit him in Bordeaux, gave her 1,000 francs and pieces of furniture from the home she had shared with his father. She wrote to a number of Goya's friends to complain of her exclusion, and that Javier had stolen silverware and pistols from her home. Unfortunately for her, many of her friends were Goya's and by then old men and had died, or died before they could reply. Largely destitute she moved into rented accommodation. In poverty, she passed on her copy of the Caprichos for free. She also sold The Milkmaid of Bordeaux- Goya had told her not to accept less than 'one ounce of gold' - to the Count of Mugurino, but the price she received is lost.Connel (2004), p. 234 Her French pension was cut off shortly after. She possessed a number of Goya's drawings, which she auctioned in 1849; however again it is unknown how much she received for any of them.Connell (2004), p. 235 Notes Bibliography * Buchholz, Elke Linda.

The ward comprises the communities of Clapham Park and the Hyde Farm Estate. The ward shares the borough's western boundary with Wandsworth along Cavendish Road and Emmanuel Road alongside Tooting Bec Common. The south eastern boundary then continues along Emmanuel Road and New Park Road to the A205 South Circular Road. The boundaries of northern part of the ward follow the boundaries of the Clapham Park estate east of Kings Avenue and then cross to run down Clarence Avenue and Poynders Road. The ward is located in the Streatham parliamentary constituency. Political history  In the London local elections of 1968, the Conservatives took control of the Greater London Council on a landslide. Included in this was Lambeth, where the Conservatives also swept to power. In the previously safe Labour ward of Ferndale, they took all three seats. Third of the three elected was future Prime Minister John Major, seventy votes ahead of his nearest Labour rival. Major, who had grown up nearby, was made Chairman of the Housing Committee, and responsible for overseeing the building of several large council estates. However, in 1971, the trend was reversed, both in London as a whole and Lambeth.

Background In 1833 the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission created the Legislative Council of Ceylon, the first step in representative government in British Ceylon. Initially the Legislative Council consisted of 16 members: the British Governor, the five appointed members of the Executive Council of Ceylon, four other government officials and six appointed unofficial members (three Europeans, one Sinhalese, one Tamil and one Burgher). In 1889 the number of appointed unofficial members was increased to eight (three Europeans, one Low Country Sinhalese, one Kandyan Sinhalese, one Tamil, one Muslim and one Burgher). The Legislative Council was reformed in 1910 by the McCallum Reforms. Membership was increased to 21 of which 11 were officially appointed and 10 were unofficial (two elected Europeans, one elected Burgher, one elected educated Ceylonese, two appointed Low Country Sinhalese, two appointed Tamils, one appointed Kandyan Sinhalese and one appointed Muslim). Less than 3,000 Ceylonese were eligible to vote for the four elected unofficial members. Further reforms were enacted in 1920 by the First Manning Reforms. Membership was increased to 37 of which 14 were officially appointed and 23 were unofficial (11 elected on a territorial basis, five elected Europeans, two elected Burghers, one elected to represent the Chamber of Commerce, two appointed Kandyan Sinhalese, one appointed Muslim and one appointed Indian Tamil. The Second Manning Reforms of 1923 increased membership to 49 of which 12 were officially appointed and 37 were unofficial (23 elected on a territorial basis, three elected Europeans, two elected Burghers, one elected Ceylon Tamil for the Western Province, three elected Muslims, two elected Indian Tamils and three other appointees). The old Legislative Council was dissolved in August 1924 and elections held. Less than 205,000 Ceylonese (4%) were eligible to vote for the 34 elected unofficial members. The new Legislative Council was constituted on 15 October 1924.

Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 93. and proquaestor under Quintus Sertorius's government in exile in Spain. Marius was sent by Sertorius to Mithradates of Pontus as an advisor and military commander in the Third Mithridatic War. He is named as or more likely confused with a Varius in Appian.Christoph F. Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius: A Historical Commentary, (University of North Carolina Press, 1994), p. 200. Plutarch, Memnon, and Orosius call him Marius in contexts that indicate the same man is meant. Family and political connections No connection has been established between this Marius and Gaius Marius or the other contemporary Marii of Arpinum. M. Marius is supposed to have arrived in Spain in the company of Perperna, but no further association is recorded with the man who was the prime instigator of Sertorius's assassination a few years later. Given that Marcus Marius was among the senators who fled Sulla, his politics are not likely to have been antithetical to those of the better-known Marian populares. A passage in OrosiusOrosius 6.2.21‚Äì22. implies, but does not directly state, that he was on the list of the proscribed.Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius, p. 182, says that he \\"can be safely counted among the proscribed.\\" He was certainly a fugas (œÜœÖŒ≥Œ¨œÇ), a fugitive or exile, in keeping with the \\"peculiar legal situation\\" of Sertorius's men, some of whom were proscripti, and others of whom were hostes publici, \\"public enemies.\\" In both cases, their lives and property were forfeit, and their sons and grandsons lost the rights of citizenship, but the proscribed in addition had bounties on their heads.Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius, p. 182. Mission to the East Coin of Mithradates VI Sertorius sent Marcus Marius as a military advisor and his representative to Mithradates during the protracted negotiations between the two over an alliance. By 75 BC, Mithradates offered to recognize Sertorius as head of the Roman state,B.C. McGing in The Foreign Policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus (Brill, 1986), notes that \\"it is not completely clear whether Mithridates treated with Sertorius as a government in exile, or as a rebel. ‚Ä¶ Plutarch's story, however, of Marius taking precedence over Eupator in Asia, does seem to indicate that the king treated Sertorius in something like the same way that Sertorius treated himself ‚Äî as the leader of a government in exile\\" (p. 142). and sent aid in the form of 3,000 talents (72 million sesterces) and a fleet of 40 ships;The timing of the fleet's departure for Spain is not altogether clear in the ancient sources, and reconstructions by modern scholars place it variously: before Marius went East, shortly after his arrival, or after Mithradates broke off his siege at Cyzicus. Konrad argues that the fleet was sent after Marius's arrival and probably arrived in Spain sometime between summer 75 and spring 74. in return, he asked that Sertorius recognize his claims in Anatolia. Sertorius reserved in his own name Rome's claim to Asia, already organized as a province and acquired ‚Äî he insisted ‚Äî legitimately, but he asserted no rights over Bithynia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, and Galatia; these, he said, \\"had nothing to do with the Romans.\\"Appian, Mithridatic Wars 68: m√™den pros√™konta R√¥maiois; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius 23‚Äì24. Marius went East with troops. Bearing the fasces and axes, he entered at least two Asian cities and granted them and a number of others independent status and tax exemptions on behalf of the Sertorian government; in effect, he assumed possession of Asia with proconsular powers. His authority was held pro praetore, that is, under the auspices of Sertorius and without holding his own imperium. Plutarch calls him a strat√™gos (œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥œåœÇ), \\"general,\\" rather than a praetor.Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius, pp. 187 and 201‚Äì202. In Plutarch's view, the province welcomed the new regime, because it had been oppressed by Rome's tax collectors and contractors (publicani) and by the \\"rapacity and insolence\\" of the soldiers stationed there. Marius's policy is consistent with that of Sertorius in cultivating the goodwill of the provincials under his government.Plutarch, Sertorius 24; Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius, p. 202. Mithradates permitted Marius to assert Roman primacy as agreed. The treaty with the Pontic king was concluded in the summer of 74, in anticipation of what would become the Third Mithridatic War in the spring of 73.The start date of the Third Mithridatic War has been a vexed scholarly question divided into camps advocating the spring either of 74 or of 73; see McGing, Foreign Policy of Mithridates, pp. 138‚Äì139. Sertorius and M. Marius were not the only Romans who preferred an alliance to a war with Mithradates. Two former officers of the notorious Fimbria, Lucius Magius and Lucius Fannius, joined the Pontic king,On the politics of Magius and Fannius, see Emilio Gabba, Republican Rome, The Army, and the Allies (University of California Press, 1976), p. 113 online. A Publius Magius was tribune of the plebs in 87 BC with M. Marius Gratidianus. and both Appuleius DecianusBobbio Scholiast 95 (Stangl). Appian is misleading, or the text has been misread, when he calls Magius and Fannius \\"Sertorians\\"; see Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius, pp. 191‚Äì192. and the senator AttidiusAppian, Mithridatic Wars 90; this long friendship, however, ended with Attidius's execution in a conspiracy. were fixtures of some longevity at the Pontic court.McGing, The Foreign Policy of Mithridates, p. 145. None of these men was a political moderate, and all had strong ties to vehement or even extremist populares.Gabba, Republican Rome, the Army, and the Allies, places Magius in particular among the \\"extremists\\" (p. 59). See also Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius, p. 198. Military command and death With the alliance between Pontus and Roman Hispania, Sulla's second civil war thus continued in the East and merged into the Third Mithridatic War.C.F. Konrad, \\"From the Gracchi to the First Civil War (133‚Äì70),\\" in A Companion to the Roman Republic (Wiley- Blackwell, 2007, 2010), p. 185 online. In late 75 BC, Nicomedes IV of Bithynia died, leaving his kingdom to Rome as a bequest. Sertorius probably made his arrangements before that time, or at least before he was aware that the death had created a new Roman province in Anatolia. Its first Roman governor was Marcus Aurelius Cotta, the consul of 74. The other consul of that year, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, managed to jettison his originally assigned province of Cisalpine Gaul and acquire a more ambitious playing field: the provinces of Cilicia and eventually Asia, along with the chief command of the war against Mithradates.Konrad, Companion, p. 185. Lucullus landed in Anatolia during the fall of 74. Mithradates saw his opportunity, and invaded Cappadocia and Bithynia. During this period, Marcus Marius served as advisor and co-commander to the Pontic king. At Chalcedon, a maritime town of Bithynia, they marched and sailed against Cotta, who rushed into battle before Lucullus could join him, prematurely savoring a triumph he didn't want to share. Cotta was instead crushed and forced to withdraw within the town.Arthur Keaveney, Lucullus: A Life (Routledge, 1992), p. 77. Marius held joint command with Mithradates' general Eumachos at Chalcedon and in Phrygia.Konrad, Companion, p. 185. The ancient sources on Marius's military role include Plutarch, Lucullus 8.5 and 12.2‚Äì5; Memnon, Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker (Felix Jacoby) 434 F (1.28.3) = Memnon 28‚Äì29; Appian, Mithridatic Wars 68, 76, 77; Orosius 6.2; and Cicero, Pro Murena 33 (where he is not named). Lucullus was camped somewhere along the Sangarius river in Bithynia when he received news of Cotta's defeat. His soldiers urged him to leave Cotta to his own folly and march on undefended Pontus with its rich potential for loot. Lucullus preferred to concentrate on Mithridates himself, and headed toward Chalcedon. Marius blocked and confronted him. They faced off at Otroea near Nicaea (present-day Iznik).Keaveney, Lucullus, p. 77. Although Lucullus commanded 30,000 infantry and 2,500 horse, he was daunted by the size of the opposing army and reluctant to engage. The arrival of an omen, as reported by Plutarch, was thus fortuitous:Plutarch, Lucullus 8. No battle occurred. For Marius, delay posed a logistical problem. He had only a few days of supplies for his troops. Lucullus learned of the shortage through prisoner interrogations and decided to wait him out. Marius was forced to move on without the fight he had sought, but the delay allowed Mithradates to leave Chalcedon and set out for Cyzicus. Mithradates' motive for this siege has sometimes been construed as retribution for the aid given by Cyzicus to the Romans at Chalcedon, but was also a strategic decision. Cyzicus was weakened from losing a significant number of troops at Chalcedon, and its capture would provide him with an abundant and much-needed food supply, as well as access to an excellent harbor and major inland routes.Keaveney, Lucullus, p. 78. After taking up a position, he divided his forces for a three-prong invasion of the interior. His general Eumachus headed to Phrygia, where he advanced into Pisidia and Isauria. Metrophanes and the Roman renegade Lucius Fannius penetrated as far as northeast Lydia. Lucius Magius remained with Mithradates and appears from this point to have begun misleading him, perhaps because he had heard what may have been still only a rumor of Sertorius's death. According to some reconstructions of events, it was at this time that Marius assumed the governorship of the Roman province of Asia, where he gained immediate control of Parium and Lampsacus, rejoining the Pontic forces only later in the siege; this is not entirely clear in the ancient sources, which may be recounting operations he conducted earlier upon arrival.This sequence of events is presented by Keaveney, Lucullus, pp. 78‚Äì79 and 83, who regards Marius's governorship as unsuccessful, contra Plutarch; Keaveney has Mithradates sending ships to Sertorius only at this point, which likely would mean they arrived only after his assassination. Despite the size of Mithradates' forces and his awe-inspiringPlutarch, Lucullus 10. siegecraft, he failed to take Cyzicus and its rich stores. Lucullus blocked inland supply routes. The multitudinous Pontic troops were weakened and reduced by famine and plague, and finally Mithradates was compelled to retreat by ship. He placed 30,000 ground troops under the command of Marius and Hermaios.Memnon 28. They enabled the king to escape, but lost 11,000 men at the Aesepus (present-day G√∂nen) and Granicus (Biga) rivers.Keaveney, Lucullus p. 84. Marius then took to the sea. Along with Alexandros the Paphlagonian and Dionysios Eunuchos (\\"the Eunuch\\"), he was placed in joint command of 50 ships and 10,000 handpicked men, among them, in the words of Mommsen, \\"the flower of the Roman emigrants.\\"Theodor Mommsen, The History of Rome, vol. 4, p. 329. Their intention seems to have been to sail east into the Aegean, but Lucullus mounted an attack against them. He captured a detachment of 13 ships between the island of Tenedos and the mainland harbor of the Achaeans. The main Pontic force, however, had drawn their ships to shore at a site difficult of approach, the small island of Neae between Lemnos and Scyros; Lucullus then sent infantry by land across Neae to their rear, killing many and forcing the rest back to sea.Keaveney, Lucullus, p. 85. Lucullus sunk or captured 32 ships of the royal fleet provided by Mithradates and additional transport vessels. Dionysios committed suicide, but Alexandros was captured and held for display in Lucullus's anticipated triumph. Among the dead were a number of men who had been on Sulla's proscription lists. Marius at first escaped, possibly from a sinking ship, since he was later found ashore taking refuge in a cave.Orosius 6.2.21‚Äì22. Like Sertorius himself, Marius at some point had lost an eye; when Lucullus gave the order to track down enemy survivors, he specified that no one-eyed men should be killed, so that he could personally oversee the renegade's death: \\"Lucullus wished Marius to die under the most shameful insults.\\"Plutarch, Lucullus 12.5. Orosius reports that he atoned for his rebellious spirit with penalties he earned.Orosius 6.2.2. In fiction Marcus Marius is a character in Michael Curtis Ford's historical novel about Mithradates, The Last King: Rome's Greatest Enemy (2004). He is depicted as maintaining a rugged and arrogant ideal of Republican manliness: \\"I eat like a soldier, I march like a soldier, and by the gods I fight like a soldier ‚Äî a Roman soldier.\\" Ford imagines that this Marius was a nephew of the seven-time consul ‚Äî a grandnephew would be more likely, since the consul's nephew Marcus Marius, known by his cognomen Gratidianus, died in the proscriptions ‚Äî and that his presence at the Pontic court was meant to draw the support of popularist sympathizers supposed to have been among Lucullus's forces from the legions who had served under Fimbria. Ford's fictional description of Marius's execution recalls the dismemberment of Gratidianus: \\"he had Marius mounted on a crosstree in that barbaric exercise the Romans call crucifixion and then lopped off his hands, feet, nose, and ears, pruning him like a fig tree in winter. It was a deliberately brutal message, and its effect was not lost, for it caused most of the other exiled Romans fighting for Pontus to scatter in discouragement.\\"Michael Curtis Ford, The Last King: Rome's Greatest Enemy (St. Martin's Press, 2004), pp. 227‚Äì228.

The plant had been under construction from September 2007, and was scheduled to start supplying energy in June 2010. The initial blast killed five and injured at least fifty; one of the injured later died in hospital, bringing the total death toll to six. Explosion The blast at the , Siemens combined cycle gas and oil-fired power plant occurred at 11:17 am, and was reported at 11:25 am EST. The plant's manager, Gordon Holk, said that contractors and other workers from O & G Industries, Ducci Electric, and Keystone Construction and Maintenance Services were at the site when the blast occurred. The explosion occurred at the rear of the largest building, the turbine hall, which was destroyed. Some residents reported \\"earthquake-like tremors\\" from at least away, although the blast proved not to be seismically detectable. Another resident of the area felt that it was more like a sonic boom. Possible causes According to authorities, neither terrorism or an intentional crime was the cause of the explosion, though criminal negligence was being investigated. A neighbor of the plant said that there was natural gas stored there, which was later said to be related to the explosion. Flames were reported to have been coming from a gas pipe until the gas was shut off. The local fire marshal said the explosion was the result of an attempted purging of natural gas from a pipeline as a test, a procedure known as a blow- down, and according to a state official who had been briefed on the incident, the explosion had been sparked by a \\"flame device,\\" possibly a propane heater. The president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, however, disagreed with this explanation, saying it was more likely that an inadvertent spark had caused the explosion, rather than an open flame. Reaction and follow-up Middletown deputy fire marshal Al Santostefano later said that there had been fewer than 50 people injured, as some of the workers had made it out alive, and that there were no signs of life in the ruins of the plant. At least 12 of the injured were treated at local hospitals. Emergency personnel and almost 20 ambulances were at the scene shortly after the blast occurred, using helicopters to transport victims while search-and-rescue crews with dogs scoured the rubble. Middlesex Hospital in Middletown said it was receiving patients from the blast. At least one victim was also taken to Hartford Hospital. By 1:30pm local time, at least 100 firefighters were at the scene and the fire had been extinguished. Connecticut governor M. Jodi Rell was being briefed by authorities and opened the state's emergency management center, and she later traveled to the scene of the explosion. Connecticut State Police said they were sending detectives to investigate the explosion. Rescue officials at the plant turned away reporters because hazardous material leakage was possible. Nearby hospitals and surrounding states also offered to aid in the rescue process. The Joint Terrorism Task Force also arrived at the site of the explosion but were only there to monitor, as local and state officials were handling the investigation. The federal Chemical Safety Board deployed a seven-person team to the site, which was expected to be on the scene by Monday, February 8, but was later prohibited from entering the site. The mayor of Middletown said the plant will ultimately be rebuilt, a statement that was confirmed by a Kleen Energy official, who said that construction would resume once the investigation into the incident was completed. In February 2011, it was announced that Kleen Energy and O&G; Industries will build a memorial park to honor those who died or were injured during the blast. The plant underwent extensive repairs during the remainder of 2010 and early 2011, and is scheduled to open in April 2011. Investigation The investigation into the incident started the day after the explosion, and was conducted by agencies at the local, state and federal levels. It was expected to focus on whether human error or insufficient safety protocols were at fault. In particular, according to the local fire marshal, the investigation was to look at whether electricity was cut off from the area, whether workers had been evacuated before the purging of the gas line, and whether ignition sources were present. Several days before the explosion, the Chemical Safety Board had approved new recommendations on gas line purging in the United States following an explosion at a food manufacturing plant in North Carolina in 2009 that killed four people. Despite the Board's interest in the case, a spokesman said on February 9 that their team of investigators was being denied entrance to the site of the explosion, on the grounds that the area was a crime scene. (The Chemical Safety Board did eventually deploy a team of ten investigators to the site.) The USCSB also released a video documenting their investigation. On August 5, 2010, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced that it planned to fine seventeen companies involved in the construction of the plant a total of $16.6 million. OSHA said that it had found a total of 371 safety violations in the construction of the plant, 225 of which it considered deliberate.https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/08052010 The Chemical Safety Board released its final report on June 28, 2010.

In 2004, the National-Louis University (a multi-campus institution in Chicago) Office of Institutional Management Grants Center received an American Psychological Association Grant for Gale Stam Psychology College of Arts and Sciences to provide \\"a Festschrift conference honoring Professor David McNeill of the University of Chicago.\\" Research McNeill specializes in psycholinguistics, and in particular scientific research into the relationship of language to thought, and the gestures that accompany discourse. In his research, McNeill has studied videoed discourses of the same stimulus stories being retold \\"together with their co-occurring spontaneous gestures\\" by \\"speakers of different languages, [...] by non-native speakers at different stages of learning English, by children at various ages, by adolescent deaf children not exposed to language models, and by speakers with neurological impairments (aphasic, right hemisphere damaged, and split-brain patients).\\" This and other research has formed the subject matter of a number of books which McNeill has written through his career. Research on the psychology of language and gesture Central idea The \\"growth point\\" is a key theoretical concept in McNeill's approach to psycholinguistics and is central to his work on gestures, specifically those spontaneous and unwitting hand movements that regularly accompany informal speech. The growth point, or GP, posits that gestures and speech are unified and need to be considered jointly. For McNeill, gestures are in effect (or, McNeill would say, in reality) the speaker's thought in action, and integral components of speech, not merely accompaniments or additions. Much evidence supports this idea, but its full implications have not always been recognized.McNeill, David. 1992. Hand and Mind. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.McNeill, David. 2005. Gesture and Thought. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.Kendon, Adam. 2004. Gesture: visible action as utterance. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Growth Points and multi-modality McNeill argues that thought is multimodal: both vocal-linguistic and manual-gestural, and the resulting semiotic opposition fuels change. In terms of semiotics, as a kind of sign, a gesture is \\"global\\" (in that the meanings of the \\"parts\\"‚Äîthe hand shapes, space, direction, articulation‚Äì-depend in a top-down fashion on the meaning of the whole) and \\"synthetic\\" (in that several meanings are bundled into one gesture). Gestures, when they combine, do not form what Ferdinand de Saussure terms syntagmatic values; they paint a more elaborate picture but contain nothing corresponding to the emerging syntagmatic value of a noun as a direct object when combined with a verb (\\"hit the ball\\", where \\"ball\\", by itself, is not a direct object). Speech contrasts on each of these points: it is bottom-up, analytic and combinatoric. Minimal units Speech and gesture, taken together, comprise minimal units of human linguistic cognition. Following Lev Vygotsky in defining a \\"unit\\" as the smallest package that retains the quality of being a whole, in this case the whole of a gesture-language unity, McNeill calls the minimal psychological unit a Growth Point because it is meant to be the initial pulse of thinking-for-(and while)-speaking, out of which a dynamic process of organization emerges. The linguistic component of speech categorizes the visual and actional imagery of the gesture; the imagery of the gesture grounds the linguistic categories in a visual spatial frame. Connections to phenomenology McNeill employs the concept of \\"material carriers\\", a phrase used by VygotskyVygotsky, Lev. S. 1987. Thought and Language. Edited and translated by E. Hanfmann and G. Vakar (revised and edited by A. Kozulin). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. to refer to the embodiment of meaning in enactments or material experiences to further develop the concepts of Mead's Loop and the GP. A material carrier enhances the symbolization's representational power. The concept implies that the gesture, \\"the actual motion of the gesture itself\\", is a dimension of meaning. This enhancement is possible if the gesture \\"is\\" the very image; not an \\"expression\\" or \\"representation\\" of it, but \\"it\\". From this viewpoint, a gesture is an image in its most developed: that is, its most materially, naturally embodied form. The absence of a gesture is the converse, an image in its least material form. The material carrier concept thus helps explain how an imagery-language dialectic can take place in absence of gesture. When no gesture occurs, there is still global-synthetic imagery in a dialectic with linguistic categorization, but we experience it at the \\"lowest level of materialization\\". It is not an alteration of the dialectic of its essentials-‚Äìthe simultaneous rendering of meaning in opposite semiotic modes-‚Äìbut a bleached version of it. McNeill furthers this conception of the material carrier by turning to Maurice Merleau-Ponty for insight into the duality of gesture and language. Gesture, the instantaneous, global, nonconventional component, is \\"not an external accompaniment\\" of speech, which is the sequential, analytic, combinatoric component; it is not a \\"representation\\" of meaning, but instead meaning \\"inhabits\\" it. Merleau-Ponty links gesture and existential significance: > The link between the word and its living meaning is not an external > accompaniment to intellectual processes, the meaning inhabits the word, and > language 'is not an external accompaniment to intellectual processes'. We > are therefore led to recognize a gestural or existential significance to > speech. ‚Ä¶ Language certainly has inner content, but this is not self- > subsistent and self-conscious thought. What then does language express, if > it does not express thoughts? It presents or rather it is the subject‚Äôs > taking up of a position in the world of his meanings. [emphasis in the > original]Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. 1962. Phenomenology of Perception. Colin > Smith, trans. London and New York: Routledge. For McNeill, the GP is a mechanism geared to this \\"existential significance\\" of speech, this \\"taking up a position in the world\\". Gesture, as part of the GP, is inhabited by the same \\"living meaning\\" that inhabits the word (and beyond, the whole of a discourse). A deeper answer to the query, therefore-‚Äìwhen we see a gesture, what are we seeing?--is that we see part of the speaker's current cognitive being, \\"her very mental existence\\", at the moment it occurs. This too is part of the origin of language by Mead's Loop (and explains the gestural leakage of lies.Ekman, Paul. 1981. \\"Mistakes when deceiving.\\" Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, pp. 269-278. By performing the gesture, a core idea is brought into concrete existence and becomes part of the speaker's own existence at that moment. A gesture is not a representation, or is not only such: it is a form of being. From a first- person perspective, the gesture is part of the immediate existence of the speaker. Gestures (and words, etc., as well) are themselves thinking in one of its many forms, not only expressions of thought, \\"but thought, i.e., cognitive being, itself\\". To the speaker, gesture and speech are not only \\"messages\\" or communications, but are a way of cognitively existing, of cognitively being, at the moment of speaking. To make a gesture, from this perspective, is to bring thought into existence on a concrete plane, just as writing out a word can have a similar effect. The greater the felt departure of the thought from the immediate context, the more likely is its materialization in a gesture, because of this contribution to being. Conversely, when \\"newsworthiness\\" is minimal materialization diminishes and in some cases disappears, even though a GP is active; in these cases gestures may cease while (empty) speech continues, or vice versa, speech ceases and a vague gesture takes place. Thus, gestures are more or less elaborated and GPs more or less materialized depending on the importance of material realization to the \\"existence\\" of the thought. Language origin and Mead‚Äôs Loop In terms of the origin of language, the GP \\"predicts\\" (of the remote past) that whatever evolved led to a GP system of semiotic oppositions. This provides an empirical test of all theories on the origin of language: Can the theory in question explain the observed speech-gesture-thought unity of human cognition? The widely popular \\"gesture-first\\" theory, according to which language began as pure gesture without speech, fails this test. In fact, it fails it twice, predicting what did not evolve (that speech supplanted gesture) and not predicting what did evolve (our own speech-gesture unity). An alternative, which McNeill calls \\"Mead's Loop\\" after the philosopher George Herbert Mead, explains this unity. It too claims that gesture was essential to the origin of language, but not because it was \\"primitive\\" or more accessible. Rather, it says that speech could not have evolved without gesture; neither could gesture have evolved without speech. Speech and gesture originated together, at the same time, in response to the same selection pressures. Natural selection Mead's Loop and the mirror neuron \\"twist\\" would be naturally selected in scenarios where sensing one's own actions as social is advantageous. For example, in imparting information to infants, where it gives the adult the sense of being an instructor as opposed to being just a doer with an onlooker, as is the case with chimpanzees.Tomasello, Michael. 1999. The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. Entire cultural practices of childrearing depend upon this sense.Vygotsky, Lev. S. 1978. Mind in Society. M. Cole, V. John-Steiner, S. Scribner, and E. Souberman (eds.). Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.John-Steiner, Vera, Panofsky, Carolyn P. and Smith, Larry W. (eds.). 1994. Sociocultural Approaches to Language and Literacy: An interactionist perspective. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Self-awareness as an agent is necessary for this advantage to take hold. For Mead's Loop to have been selected the adult must be sensitive to her own gestures as social actions. The link between the GP and self-aware agency also appears in children's language development, which can be linked to the origin of language in a version of the long-dismissed \\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\\" hypothesis of recapitulation theory. McNeill considers that when something emerges in current-day ontogenesis only at a certain stage of development, the original natural selection of the feature (if there was any) might have taken place in a similar psychological milieu in phylogenesis. This opens a window onto the mindset of the creature in which the Mead's Loop \\"twist\\" was evolving. As a mode of reasoning, it exploits the fact that children's intellectual status is not fixed but changing. Thus, McNeill argues, we look for new states that seem pegged to steps in the ontogenesis of GPs and Mead's Loop underlying them, and consider these steps as possible signals from ancient phylogenesis. Evidence shows that self-aware agency could be such a signal. The GP emerges around age 3 or 4 years, which is also about when children first become aware of themselves as agents, since before that age the speech and gestures of children have ‚Äú‚Ä¶the character of 'sharing' experiences with the other rather than of 'communicating' messages to the Other\\", as put by Heinz Werner and Bernard Kaplan in their 1963 book, Symbol Formation. The theory of mind (which is really awareness of other perspectives) also emerges about this time, and likewise depends on self-aware agency. Reception McNeill's books have received coverage in a number of academic journals and in the general press. A 1991 article in the Chicago Reader; a 2006 article in the Scientific American, Mind magazine; and a 2008 article in Boston Globe describe McNeill's work on the language of gesture in detail.

The film deals with various issues, such as war crimes, handicapped veterans, and spousal abuse. The film also deals with themes of sexual perversion and features graphic sex scenes. It was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival. Shinobu Terajima received the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival for her portrayal of Kurokawa's wife. Plot The film is set in the late 1930s, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In the first scene, Lieutenant Kurokawa scourges, rapes and disembowels Chinese people during the war. Later, he returns home as a war hero, but with a horribly mutilated body. He is alive but reduced to a torso (no limbs), deaf and mute, with burns covering half of his face, but with three medals on his chest. Despite his condition, he is still constantly eager for sex, which he performs acrobatically with his wife. The sexual acts are rough and are imposed on his wife, who is repulsed by him. Nevertheless she feels a duty to take care of him. The film concludes with the disabled veteran Kurokawa committing suicide by dragging himself into a pond outside his home.

They were laid on the exterior of timber-framed buildings as an alternative to brickwork, which their appearance closely resembled. A distinctive black variety with a glazed surface was used on many buildings in Brighton (now part of the city of Brighton and Hove) from about 1760 onwards, and is considered a characteristic feature of the town's early architecture. Although the brick tax (1784‚Äì1850) was formerly thought to have encouraged use of mathematical tiles, in fact the tiles were subject to the same tax. Name The precise origin of the name \\"mathematical\\" is unknown. Local historian Norman Nail ascribes it to the \\"neat geometric pattern\\" produced by the tiles. John W. Cowan suggests it means \\"exactly regular\\", an older sense of \\"mathematical\\" which is now rare.; citing Oxford English Dictionary 3rd edition, s.v. \\"mathematical\\" sense 5(b). Other attributive names include \\"brick\\", \\"geometrical\\", \\"mechanical\\", \\"rebate\\", \\"wall\\", or \\"weather\\" tiles. According to Christopher Hussey, \\"weather tile\\" is an earlier more general term, with the true \\"mathematical tile\\" distinguished by its flush setting. In 18th-century Oxford \\"feather edge tile\\" was used. While \\"mathematical tile\\" is now usual, Nail considered it a \\"pretentious\\" innovation, preferring \\"brick tile\\" as an older and more authentic name. Usage and varieties 9 Pool Valley, Brighton has a black tile fa√ßade of 1794. The tiles were laid in a partly overlapping pattern, akin to roof shingles. Their lower section‚Äîthe part intended to be visible when the tiling was complete‚Äîwas thicker; the upper section would slide under the overlapping tile above and would therefore be hidden. In the top corner was a hole for a nail to be inserted. They would then be hung on a lath of wood, and the lower sections would be moulded together with an infill of lime mortar to form a flat surface. The interlocking visible surfaces would then resemble either header bond or stretcher bond brickwork. Mathematical tiles had several advantages over brick: they were cheaper, easier to lay than bricks (skilled workmen were not needed), and were more resistant to the weathering effects of wind, rain and sea-spray, making them particularly useful at seaside locations such as Brighton. Various colours of tile were produced: red, to resemble brick most closely; honey; cream; and black. Brighton, the resort most closely associated with mathematical tiles, has examples of each. Many houses on the seafront east of the Royal Pavilion and Old Steine, for example on Wentworth Street, have cream-coloured tiles, and honey-coloured tiles were used by Henry Holland in his design for the Marine Pavilion‚Äîforerunner of the Royal Pavilion. Holland often used mathematical tiles in his commissions, although he usually used blue Gault clay to make them. A 1987 count of surviving mathematical tiles in English counties found the most in Kent (407 buildings), followed by Sussex (382), Wiltshire (50), Surrey (47), and Hampshire (37 including the Isle of Wight). Black glazed tiles Black glazed mathematical tiles‚Äîas seen here at 44 Old Steine‚Äîare a characteristic feature of Brighton's 18th-century architecture. The black glazed type is most closely associated with the Brighton's early architecture: such tiles had the extra advantage of reflecting light in a visually attractive way. Black mathematical tiles started to appear in the 1760s, soon after the town began to grow in earnest as its reputation as a health resort became known. When Patcham Place, a mid 16th-century house in nearby Patcham (now part of the city of Brighton and Hove), was rebuilt in 1764, it was clad entirely in the tiles. Royal Crescent, Brighton's first unified architectural set piece and first residential development built to face the sea, was faced in the same material when it was built between 1799 and 1807. When Pool Valley‚Äîthe site where a winterbourne drained into the English Channel‚Äîwas built over in the 1790s, one of the first buildings erected there was a mathematical tiled two-storey shop. Both the building (now known as 9 Pool Valley) and the fa√ßade survive. All three of these have Grade II* listed status, indicating that in the context of England's architecture they are \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". Other examples can be seen at Grand Parade‚Äîthe east side of Old Steine, developed haphazardly with large houses in a variety of styles and materials in the early 19th century; York Place, a fashionable address when built in the 1800s; and Market Street in The Lanes, Brighton's ancient core of narrow streets. Lewes, the county town of East Sussex, has many buildings mathematical tiles in black and other colours. These include the Grade I-listed Jireh Chapel in the Cliffe area of the town which is clad in red mathematical tiles and dark grey slate. The timber-framed chapel was built in 1805. Elsewhere, a study in 2005 identified 22 18th-century timber-framed buildings (mostly townhouses) with mathematical tiles of various colours. Examples are the semi-detached pair at 199 and 200 High Street, the small terrace at 9‚Äì11 Market Street, 33 School Hill (an old building with a mid-18th century renewed fa√ßade), and the Quaker meeting house of 1784.

It is the tallest completed building in Guangzhou, the third-tallest in China, and the seventh-tallest in the world. The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre has a total of 111 above ground and five below ground floors and houses a shopping mall, offices, apartments, and a hotel. The skyscraper has a gross floor area of , of which a little over 20% is not part of the skyscraper itself, but of the podium connected to it. The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre is situated on a lot along Zhujiang East Road in Zhujiang New Town, Guangzhou's central business district. In that neighborhood, the skyscraper is located east of the central axis with an underground mall and connections to public transportation underneath it. The Guangzhou CTF Centre is part of the Guangzhou Twin Towers. The other tower of the pair, the tall Guangzhou International Finance Center, is located on the other side of the axis and is also known under the name \\"West Tower\\". The Guangzhou CTF Centre is therefore known as the \\"East Tower\\" as well. Both towers have a similar height, size, and function, and are situated close to the tall Canton Tower. The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre is owned by Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, and houses the world's fastest elevators, which can reach speeds up to .  Architecture  The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre consists of a skyscraper and an eight-floor podium, that is connected to the skyscraper. The podium features a high atrium with a glass roof. The skyscraper is supported by a square core with sides of and eight concrete mega columns on the sides. They are linked by outriggers and belt trusses, that are located exclusively on mechanical and refuge floors. The skyscraper has a total of four levels of steel outriggers and six sets of double-layer belt trusses. Smaller columns are in between the mega columns. The mega columns have a length up to and a width up to . They are thicker than usual to meet the Chinese seismic codes and they are supported by a mat and pad foundation. This foundation sits on relatively high bedrock. The facade of the skyscraper is made out of glass and has vertical mullions, made out of white glazed terracotta. The mullions are projecting out from the windows to create shades. The windows are operable and there are vents between them and the terracotta. Aluminum fins are located next to the vents to protect them from the wind. White LEDs are integrated into the fins to light the terracotta at night. The terracotta mullions make the exterior of the building lighter. It was not possible to create the brightness of the building by using lighter glass, since the local environmental codes do not allow more reflective glass. More standard metal mullions would have created this effect as well, but architect Forth Bagley, who lead the design, said in an interview with CNN they had chosen consciously for terracotta \\"to inject into the architecture an indigenous craft, that was specific to Guangzhou as a city.\\" Furthermore, he said about the design that the skyscraper was not only set apart from the surrounding towers \\"by virtue of its height [...], but also by its simplicity.\\" The skyscraper in December 2015 The shape of the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre is defined by its mixed-usage: the different uses require different floor sizes and the building is shaped to accommodate those demands. Namely, the skyscraper has setbacks at points where the usage changes: the setbacks are located between the offices and the apartments, between the apartments and the hotel, and between the hotel and the crown of the building. The setbacks are angled and contain parapets with sky terraces. The top of the building is angled as well, but doesn't contain a sky terrace. The angled parapets point at the tops of various nearby tall buildings. Because of the setbacks, the building looks different from every angle. Different techniques were used to make the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre more environmentally friendly. For example, it has efficient chillers and the podium's roof features solar panels. Moreover, the heat from the condensers of the chillers is recovered. The office and retail parts of the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre together received a LEED Gold certification in 2018 after having received a pre-certification in 2013.  Layout  The below ground floors and the podium of the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre feature a shopping mall and an underground parking facility with 1,705 spaces. The shopping mall is called \\"K11 Art Mall\\" and is owned by K11, a subsidiary of Chow Tai Fook Enterprises. It features a 4DX theater with eight rooms and occupies the entire eight-floor podium and two below ground floors. The mall's surface area amounts to around . The base of the actual skyscraper is occupied by the office lobby, the entrance hall of the apartments and a part of the hotel. The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre is connected to other nearby buildings through outdoor pedestrian bridges and to subway lines 3, 5, and APM through underground links. The offices occupy the floors 7 through 66, but are interrupted by two mechanical floors. Next to the (GFA) of Class A office space, the office floors house a sky lobby and a 150-person auditorium. The office floors are owned by K11. 24 floors with a total of 355 serviced apartments are situated above another mechanical floor and a setback. They are owned by Rosewood Hotel Group and have a total area of . 23 of those \\"Rosewood Residences\\" are duplex apartments and some apartments have their own elevators and indoor courtyards. The apartments were designed by Perception Design. The highest sixteen floors are occupied by a hotel, that is separated from the apartments by another mechanical floor. The hotel, that opened in the second half of 2019, is managed by Rosewood Hotels & Resorts and has a total of 251 rooms with a minimum size of . The floor area of the entire hotel amounts to . It also features meeting spaces, a ballroom, an indoor pool and seven cafes and restaurants. The sky bar and restaurant on the 107th floor are partly situated on an outdoor terrace. The meeting spaces cover an area of and the ballroom, that fits 700 people, covers an area of . Most of the interior of the hotel was designed by design firm Yabu Pushelberg. The setback above the hotel is covered with three terraces. The strong winds are not felt on those terraces because of the chiseled parapets.  Elevators  The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre has 95 elevators made by Hitachi, including two elevators that are among the world's fastest. In 2014, Hitachi announced that those two elevators would be able to reach 1,200 m/min. () and would carry passengers through the long shaft from the first to the 95th floor in approximately 43 seconds. These two elevators are used to bring hotel guests from the entrance to the lobby. In May 2016, the elevators were first tested and reached the promised maximum speed. In June 2017, the elevators were tested after having modified them to be able to deliver an even faster speed above the rated speed of 20 m/s, and they managed to reach a top speed of . This exceeded the top speed Shanghai Tower's elevators could deliver which was a top speed of , making the lifts within the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre the world's fastest. To achieve their top speed, the elevators in the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre use permanent magnet synchronous motors. The air pressure is adjusted in order to prevent ear blockages and the elevators have rollers to smoothen the ride. Additionally, the emergency brakes can withstand temperatures up to . Besides the two fastest elevators, the building has 28 double-deck elevators (with speeds of 150‚Äì450 m/min.), 13 high-speed elevators (210‚Äì600 m/min.), and 52 medium- and low-speed elevators. The designers chose for double-deck elevators in order to minimize the number of elevator shafts. The offices, apartments, and the hotel all have separate elevators.  Development and construction  The skyscraper under construction in December 2012 The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre was first meant to be similar to the Guangzhou International Finance Center, that is situated on the other side of the central axis of Zhujiang New Town, but it was decided to make the new skyscraper taller and to give it a different shape. The developer of the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre, New World Development, which is a subsidiary of Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, held a competition to design the building. The American firm Kohn Pedersen Fox won the competition in 2009 and thus became the main architect. The Guangzhou Design Institute and Leigh & Orange became the architects of record and the British Arup Group was chosen to engineer the building. The groundbreaking took place on September 29, 2009 ‚Äì about half a year after the designing process started. China State Construction Engineering was the contractor.

The film is based on a novel by the Austrian author Martin Prinz, and was shot on location in Vienna. The main character, Johann Rettenberger, is based on Austrian bank-robber and runner Johann Kastenberger. The film was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival. Plot Johann (Andreas Lust) is a convicted felon and marathon runner who has been paroled from prison for attempted armed robbery. Upon his release he immediately continues to commit bank robbery, armed with a shotgun and disguised with a mask. He then moves in with a young social worker and friend, Erika (Franziska Weisz), and the two soon begin a relationship. Johann goes on to win several marathons with record times, and is congratulated by his parole officer. However, after committing several more robberies, Erika begins to suspect Johann. After finding Johann's loot under his bed she asks him to leave, but not before telling him that change is possible. After weeks of Johann failing to contact his parole officer, the officer shows up after a marathon to talk with Johann. The officer expresses concern that Johann is not keeping in contact and cooperating with him. After pressing Johann to talk with him, Johann becomes enraged and bludgeons his parole officer to death with his trophy. After a final meeting with Erika, Johann is apprehended by the police in the hotel room where he had kept his money, having been turned in by a heartbroken Erika. After being handed a confession to sign, Johann breaks out of jail through a window and leads the police on a cross country manhunt on foot. He takes refuge in the house of an old man, and during the process of tying him up, the old man pulls a concealed pocket knife and stabs Johann deeply. Johann takes the old man‚Äôs car and drives until he notices a helicopter following him, after which he switches cars with some motorists at a rest stop, and seemingly evades the police. As Johann continues to drive he begins to lose consciousness, and realizes the seriousness of his wound. He pulls over, dying, and calls Erika, asking her to stay on the phone. Finally his breath slows, stops, and he dies.

In the first line of defense, inhaled bacteria are trapped by mucus and are swept toward the pharynx and are swallowed. Bacteria which penetrate the mucous layer are dealt with a second line of defense which includes antimicrobial peptides that are secreted by the surface epithelium of the respiratory tract which kill many strains of bacteria. Those bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobial peptides are killed by a variety of reactive oxygen species produced by phagocytes. In a third line of defense and as a last resort, persistent bacterial infections which escape the innate immune system are eliminated by the adaptive immune system.  Lactoferrin  Schematic diagram of the respiratory tract antimicrobial defense system. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional protein which is an essential part of the respiratory tract antimicrobial defense system. LF proteolysis produces the small peptides lactoferricin and kaliocin-1 both with antimicrobial activity.  Reactive oxygen species, oxygenated compounds  Phagocytes possess a superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase enzyme complex. Other cells in the respiratory tract also produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide through the activity of dual oxidase 2 proteins, also known as Duox2. The superoxide generated by these enzymes complexes dismutates into hydrogen peroxide which in turn is used by myeloperoxidase to produce bactericidal hypochlorous acid. In addition, the submucosal glands of the respiratory tract secrete myeloperoxidase and lactoperoxidase (LPO) that catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate and detoxify hydrogen peroxide or ROS to the antimicrobial hypothiocyanite. The oxygenated compounds produced by the lactoperoxidase system does not attack DNA and is not mutagenic and is known to be safe. Hypothiocyanite generated through this pathway displays broad spectrum bactericidal activity including potent antibacterial action on H. pylori.  Cystic fibrosis  Thiocyanate secretion in cystic fibrosis patients is decreased resulting in a reduced production of the antimicrobial hypothiocyanite and consequently contributes to the increased risk of airway infection.  Therapeutic applications  Lactoferrin with hypothiocyanite for the treatment of cystic fibrosis has been granted orphan drug status by the EMEA and the FDA.

This enabled the helmsman to maintain control in heavy weather, when the rudder is under more stress and requires greater effort to handle, and also to steer the vessel were the helm damaged or destroyed. In vessels with whipstaffs (long vertical poles extending above deck, acting as a lever to move the tiller below deck), relieving lines were attached to the tiller or directly to the whipstaff. When wheels were introduced, their greater mechanical advantage lessened the need for such assistance, but relieving tackle could still be used on the tiller, located on a deck underneath the wheel.McGowan, Alan, The Century before Steam, 1700‚Äì1820, Volume 4 of The Ship, pp. 15‚Äì16.

Relieving tackle was also rigged on vessels going into battle, to assist in steering in case the helm was damaged or shot away. When a storm threatened, or battle impended, the tackle would be affixed to the tiller, and hands assigned to man them. Additional tackle was available to attach directly to the rudder as surety against loss of the tiller.Harland, John (Mark Myers, ill.), Seamanship in the Age of Sail, p. 209.

The drawing contains sexual undertones in that the victim appears to have been raped.Cottom, 59 The Belvedere Torso influenced Goya's depiction of the mutilated corpse The figuration of the dead man is based in part on the Hellenistic fragment of a male nude, the Belvedere Torso, by an Athenian sculptor.

A New York Times article estimated the number of killings to be about six up to 2010.Onishi, Norimitsu, \\"Sinatra Song Often Strikes Deadly Chord\\", February 7, 2010, The New York Times, retrieved same day Between 2002 and 2012, numerous people were killed for singing this song.Palash, Ghosh, \\"Karaoke billboard : A Bizarre Phenomenon In East Asia\\", September 10, 2012, International Business Times, retrieved March 5, 2015 Explanations for these incidents differ from the song being simply frequently sung among the nation's karaoke bars where violence is common or to perceived aggressive lyrics of the song. Background and history Karaoke singing is a widespread, popular pastime in the Philippines, including among the poor, where many were earning about $2 a day in 2007 and could purchase time on a \\"videoke\\" machine for 5 pesos (about 10 cents in US currency).Article, no byline, \\"Karaoke the great escape in Philippine slums\\", April 7, 2007, Reuters website, retrieved February 7, 2010 Filipinos who can afford to do so often get private rooms at karaoke bars. In the 2000s, about a half-dozen incidents occurred in connection with strenuous complaints over the singing of the song \\"My Way\\", prompting Filipino newspapers to name the phenomenon the \\"'My Way' killings\\". Attention to these killings peaked on May 29, 2007, when a 29-year-old karaoke singer was shot dead by a security guard at a bar in San Mateo, Rizal.Web page titled \\"Man shot for bad karaoke\\", dated May 31, 2007, Metro.co.UK website, apparently based on an Agence France Press report (the news agency is mentioned at the bottom of the page but not explicitly cited as the source of all the information on the page), retrieved February 7, 2010 The guard had complained that the young man's rendition of \\"My Way\\" was off-key, but the man refused to stop singing, prompting the guard to pull out a .38-caliber pistol and shoot the man dead.Morgan, David S., \\"Karaoke Fan Killed For Singing Out Of Tune: Philippines Man Shot By Guard At Karaoke Bar For Refusing To Stop Singing\\", CBS News website, June 2, 2007, retrieved February 7, 2010 Responses Some Filipinos, even those who love the song, will not sing it in public in order to avoid trouble or out of superstitious fear. As of 2007, the song reportedly had been taken off of the playlists of karaoke machines in many bars in Manila after complaints about out-of-tune renditions of the song resulting in violent fights and murders. As a reference to the phenomenon, Japanese rock band Kishidan released an uptempo rock cover of \\"My Way\\" as their 10th anniversary single, with a promotional music video featured lead singer (Ayonocozy Show) being shot numerous times while singing the song. Ayonocozy is then shot once more in the back while walking away after the song is concluded, collapsing in a heap on the stairs. A shortened version was used as a commercial. Explanations New York Times writer Norimitsu Onishi argued that the killings might be \\"the natural byproduct of the country's culture of violence, drinking and machismo\\". Violent attacks occur frequently in Philippine karaoke bars, with fights often sparked over breaches of karaoke etiquette ‚Äì such as laughing at other performers, performing the same song twice, or hogging the microphone. According to Roland B. Tolentino, expert for pop culture at the University of the Philippines Diliman, the killings connected to singing the song in karaoke may simply reflect its popularity in a violent environment. He also noted that the song's \\"triumphalist\\" theme might have an aggravating effect on singers and listeners alike. Yet other tunes, just as popular in the Philippines, have not resulted in murder. Butch Albarracin, the owner of \\"Center for Pop\\", a Manila-based singing school, also believes the lyrics of \\"My Way\\" increase the violence. The lyrics, as he explained, \\"evoke feelings of pride and arrogance in the singer, as if you're somebody when you're really nobody. It covers up your failures. That's why it leads to fights.\\" \\"Karaoke rage\\" in other countries Cases of singers being harassed, assaulted or killed mid-performance were being reported all over East and Southeast Asia. Incidents of \\"karaoke rage\\" outside of Asia have also been documented.

In 1987, despite opposition and demonstrations, local Centre Party politician Sven-Olle Olsson (1929‚Äì2005), who was Sj√∂bo's municipal commissioner at the time, was successful in gaining the support of the Sj√∂bo municipal assembly to hold a referendum to decide if Sj√∂bo should ban the acceptance of foreign refugees. The controversial referendum passed with a 67.4% majority for the ban in 1988, gaining Olsson and Sj√∂bo much publicity in the Swedish media. The outcome was heavily criticized by Swedish media and politicians (including then-Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson). Olsson was in turn expelled from the Centre Party following the referendum which led to the forming of the nationalist Sj√∂bo Party (Swedish: Sj√∂bopartiet) in March 1991. In the municipal elections the same year, the party received 31% of the votes. This led to Olsson once again becoming Municipal Commissioner, a position he held until 1998, when his party's support was reduced to 15% in municipal elections. Following the Sj√∂bo party's loss of support, the ban was overturned by Sj√∂bo's municipal assembly, and Sj√∂bo accepted its first refugees for more than a decade in 2001. Background and motion In 1977, while a member of the Centre Party, Sven-Olle Olsson, a former farmer, was elected as Sj√∂bo's Municipal commissioner. The Centre Party in Sj√∂bo, led by Olsson, motioned before Sj√∂bo's municipal assembly in June 1987 for a referendum on the acceptance of foreign refugees in the municipality. The motion came after a proposal that fifteen refugees be accepted into the municipality, an idea Olsson disliked. It has been speculated that the reason behind the motion was not these fifteen refugees, a small number for the municipality, but, instead, Olsson's idea to create a protest against Sweden's positive stance on refugees. Accessed on YouTube. Despite heavy protests from most of the country, Sj√∂bo's municipal assembly decided in October 1987 to go through with the referendum in 1988. If the referendum passed, it would completely ban Sj√∂bo from accepting foreign refugees. Referendum Debate and media attention A part of Sj√∂bo's town square, where both pro- and con- demonstrations were held The municipality's decision to go through with the referendum was met with even more criticism from the rest of the country. Immigration minister and Social Democrat Georg Andersson described the vote as a \\"macabre expression of egoism, and a violation of the refugees' human dignity.\\" A majority of the population in Sj√∂bo, however, was in favor of the referendum. One citizen stated that \\"Foreigners just create problems. It's only democratic to vote about this. I'm all for it.\\" The Sweden Democrats saw Sj√∂bo as an inspiration. It was, however, reported, that several of those who were in favor of accepting refugees, were afraid of expressing their opinion in public. On the day of the vote, 18 September 1988, the Associated Press reported that the refugee issue had split families, friends and even the town's only church.\\" The referendum and the protests against it also drew attention abroad. On 12 September 1988, The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote: \\"A referendum on accepting refugees in this quiet Swedish town has flared into an ugly battle watched closely by a country that prides itself on its tolerant attitudes and absence of racism.\\" Madeleine Ramel, a baroness, and the head of the local Social Welfare Board that was planning on taking care of the refugees, said: \\"a lot of people are very ashamed. It's terrible. The town has changed.\\" Ramel was Olsson's strongest opposition in Sj√∂bo at the time. The Baroness became a symbol of the minority who supported the acceptance of refugees into the municipality. According to the local newspaper Sk√•nska Dagbladet, \\"the Swedish media, especially the evening newspapers, loved the polarization between the simple farmer who did not want foreigners in the village and the baroness who wanted to take in the needy with open arms.\\" Olsson's main argument in the debate leading up to the day of the referendum was that foreigners would not be able to fit into a community such as Sj√∂bo. He repeatedly stated that these people come from \\"unknown cultures\\" and that it would be impossible for them to integrate into the Swedish society. Per- Ingvar Magnusson, the then-chairman of the Sj√∂bo branch of the Center Party, stated to the media that the referendum had nothing to do with racism; he claimed that the reason for the vote was that Sj√∂bo lacked housing and jobs. He said in an interview that he was surprised by the attention the town had received in the media: \\"They make us out to be stupid, fools, farmers who live in isolation. The town simply wants to take care of its own first.\\" Then-Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson was critical of the ban. Result The referendum was held in Sj√∂bo on 18 September 1988, the day of the Swedish general election, and passed with a 67 percent majority of the votes (6,237 for and 3,000 against), which led to even more criticism from the Swedish population. Then-Prime Minister of Sweden Ingvar Carlsson said the results were \\"tragic\\", and the then-leader of the Centre Party, Olof Johansson, called the ban \\"improper\\". The result of the referendum led to concerns from the Swedish government that other municipalities would follow in Sj√∂bo's footsteps. The day after the vote, Madeleine Ramel commented: \\"This is a sad result. Everyone is a loser. It is unfortunate for Sj√∂bo.\\" Hel√©ne L√∂√∂w, a Swedish historian, stated that one of the likely reasons for the relatively large xenophobia in Sk√•ne County at the time was the high unemployment numbers. The county had accepted a large number of refugees compared to the rest of Sweden, and many saw this as the reason for the lack of jobs. L√∂√∂w also stated that the xenophobia could have been strengthened by local traditions. Nazi groups were \\"relatively strong\\" in Sk√•ne in the 1930s. Aftermath The ban was heavily discussed in the Swedish media. Following the criticism, and after claims that Olsson was associated with the New Swedish Movement, the Centre Party decided in 1988 to exclude Olsson and his companions B√∂rje Ohlsson and Per-Ivar Magnusson from the party. They responded by forming the nationalist Sj√∂bo Party (Swedish: Sj√∂bopartiet) in March 1991. In the municipal elections the same year, the party received 31 percent of the votes. This led to Olsson once again becoming Municipal Commissioner, a position he held until 1998, when the party's support was reduced to 15% in the municipal elections. Following Sj√∂bo party's loss of support, the referendum was overturned by Sj√∂bo's municipal assembly, and Sj√∂bo accepted its first refugees since more than a decade in 2001. Although Olsson died in 2005, the party is still active, and in the 2010 municipal election the party received 11.4% of the votes, making it the third largest party in Sj√∂bo. In 2014 the nationwide anti-immigration party Sweden Democrats became the largest party in parliament elections in Sj√∂bo Municipality with a 29.96% share of the vote. Sj√∂bo was the only one of 290 municipalities where that happened and the first time the Sweden Democrats had topped a municipality in its history.

Life  L√∂w was the son of Leopold L√∂w whom he succeeded in 1878 as rabbi of Szeged, Hungary, and whose collected works he published (5 vols., 1889‚Äì1900). He was educated in his native town and in Berlin, where he studied at the Hochschule f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judentums, graduating as rabbi and receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig in 1878. The fine Szeged Synagogue built in 1903 was designed according to L√∂w's plans. In the 'White Terror' of 1920‚Äì21 he was imprisoned for 13 months for alleged statements against Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy. While in prison, he worked on his four volume work Die Flora der Juden (‚ÄúThe Flora of the Jews‚Äù), on terminology of plants in Jewish sources. Like his father, L√∂w was a great preacher in the Hungarian language, and several hundred of his sermons were published in four volumes between 1900 and 1939. On the occasion of his congregation's centenary he published (with Z. Kulinyi) the congregation's history (1885) and that of its ·∏•evra kaddisha (with S. Klein, 1887). In 1883 he published a prayer book (in Hungarian) for women, and rendered the Song of Songs and some psalms into the same language. From 1927 he represented the Neolog (non-Orthodox) communities in the upper chamber of the Hungarian parliament and also was a member of the Jewish Agency for Palestine. Soon after his 90th birthday, the Germans occupied Hungary and L√∂w was first sent to a brick factory in the local ghetto and then put on a deportation train. In Budapest, however, he was freed by Zionist workers. He died that year in Budapest. Scholarly work L√∂w‚Äôs fame as a scholar is based primarily on his pioneering work in the field of Talmud and rabbinic lexicography and in the study of plant names. This special interest is apparent in his doctoral thesis \\"Aram√§ische Pflanzennamen\\" (\\"Aramaic Plant Names\\") (1879) as well as in \\"Meleagros aus Gadara und die Flora Aramaea\\" (1883). L√∂w systematically explored the basics of plant terminology in different periods of the Hebrew and Aramaic languages, dominated the latest scientific methods in this field, made himself familiar with literary sources of plant names, and made careful use of manuscript material. With the help of Semitic languages, especially Syriac, he clarified many etymologies. He had great influence on future scholars, particularly Yehuda Feliks, who considered him one of the greatest scholars of Jewish botany. L√∂w contributed to Wilhelm Gesenius' famous Bible dictionary (10th ed., 1886; 11th ed., 1890), and to Carl Brockelmann's \\"Lexicon syriacum\\" (1895). L√∂w made critical annotations to Samuel Krauss' \\"Griechische und lateinische Lehnw√∂rter im Talmud, Midrash und Targum\\" (1899), and to the same author's supplement volume to Alexander Kohut's \\"Arukh ha-Shalem\\" (1937) and to his \\"Talmudische Arch√§ologie\\" (1910‚Äì1912) which was dedicated to L√∂w and thus saved the author many etymological errors. There are also notes of his in Julius Theodor‚ÄìHanoch Albeck's edition of \\"Genesis Rabbah\\", 3 pt. 2 (1965), 127-48ff. Both in the field of wildlife as well as minerals, he published more articles in scholarly publications. He wrote Mineralien der Juden (‚ÄúMinerals of the Jews‚Äù), but his manuscript was lost during the Holocaust in 1944. A part of his literary legacy went on to the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem, and another part to the rabbinical seminary of Budapest. His essays on fauna and minerals were reissued in 1969 (\\"Fauna und Mineralien der Juden\\") together with an introduction by Alexander Scheiber.

He served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York from 1934 to 1972. Biography Stephen Donahue was born in New York City, the fifth of ten children of Thomas P. and Dorothy (n√©e Rentz) Donahue. His father was born in England to Irish parents, and his mother was born in Germany. He received his early education at the parochial school of Holy Name Church, run by the Christian Brothers. He was encouraged by one of his teachers to enter the priesthood. After graduating from Holy Name School in 1906, he attended Cathedral College. He received the Cardinal's Medal for general excellence upon his graduation; the award was presented to him by the college's president, Father Patrick Joseph Hayes (who later became Archbishop of New York in 1919). He entered St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers in 1912. A year later, he won a scholarship to the Pontifical North American College in Rome, where he studied for five years. While in Rome, Donahue was ordained a priest by Cardinal Basilio Pompili on May 22, 1918. Following his return to New York, his first assignment was as an instructor of Sacred Scripture and Latin at Cathedral College, where he also served for a time as prefect of discipline. He was a curate at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament and at St. Gregory's Church. In 1920, he became assistant secretary to Cardinal Hayes. He was advanced to secretary in 1922, and remained in that position until 1934. In his capacity as the Cardinal's secretary, he traveled extensively with Hayes, including several trips to Rome. He was named a Monsignor in 1924. On March 5, 1934, Donahue was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Medea by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 1 from Cardinal Hayes, with Bishop Edward Mooney and Archbishop John Joseph Mitty serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. He selected as his episcopal motto: Monstra te esse matrem (Latin: \\"Show thyself a mother\\"). After his consecration, he was made pastor of his childhood parish of Holy Name Church, and frequently represented Cardinal Hayes at religious conventions and other events. When Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, then-Vatican Secretary of State and future Pope Pius XII, visited New York in 1936, Donahue took a leading role in greeting him. He also took a special interest in the Legion of Decency, and served as a member of the motion picture committee of the National Catholic Welfare Council. Donahue served as Apostolic Administrator of New York between the death of Cardinal Hayes and the appointment of Bishop Francis Spellman, and celebrated Requiem Mass for Hayes. After thirty-eight years as a bishop, he resigned on May 3, 1972. He later died at the Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan, aged 88.

Located within the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire, it is part of the administrative area of the county borough of Blaenau Gwent, Wales. St Paul's overlooking lower Cwmtillery lake History Located within a narrow valley formed by the River Tyleri, the area now known as Cwmtillery was once wholly a picturesque woodland area based beneath the heights of the local hill 'Gwastad' (551m) to the east and Mynydd James (550m)to the north. The area was mentioned by English historian William Coxe as \\"Well peopled, richly wooded and highly cultivated, almost rivalling the fertile counties of England\\". During the 1840s, Thomas Brown acquired the rights to sink a mine shaft at the site of a farm known as Tir Nicholas, in the hope of reaching the 'Elled' coal seam. The shaft was sunk to a depth of 130 yards and the colliery set up was originally known as Tir Nicholas Colliery, and later the South Wales Colliery. The mine changed hands in 1852, with John Russell taking ownership. Russell increased the original shafts and deepened the mine to 240 yards. The mine had a long history, closing in 1982; but also suffered several disasters, with four underground explosions between the dates of 1857 and 1876. The two worst disasters were in 1857 which saw the deaths of 13 miners, and the 1876 explosion which killed 16 men and boys.Cwmtillery Colliery welshcoalmines.co.uk The Church of St Paul was constructed in the Early English style during 1890 and opened for worship in January 1891, initially as a daughter church of the parish of Abertillery. A distinct parish of Cwmtillery was set up in 1923. Singer Tom Jones (then known as Tom Woodward) was first spotted and signed for a recording deal in the early 1960s at the Top Hat club in Woodland Terrace, Cwmtillery. The club burnt down in 2011.

Suppression The release of the film was blocked for several years by its producer, the National Film Board of Canada, due to its politically sensitive nature. On est au coton was completed at the height of the October Crisis, and the NFB was alarmed by the appearance of two members of the FLQ, who issued a call for armed revolution in the film. Then NFB chairman Sydney Newman also sided with textile industry executives, who pointed out what they believed to be inaccuracies and unfair portrayals in the film. Newman was quoted as stating that \\"there are many factual errors either through bad research or overzealous attempts to show the evils of capitalism. The general tone is a slashing attack on the English-controlled textile industry. I tell people, 'if you want to make a smear film, make sure you present invincible arguments.' This one didn't.\\" Release Bootleg copies spread among separatist student groups for several years until an edited version of the film was released in 1976 by Newman's successor, Andr√© Lamy. Lamy had served as Newman's assistant commissioner and had played a key role in informing his superior about potentially problematic films like On est au coton, however with the passage of time and the subsidence of political violence after the October Crisis, Lamy felt that the film no longer needed to be withheld from distribution. Moreover, the ban on distribution of On est au coton and other films was contrary to the NFB's reputation for freedom and creativity. When Lamy learned that the Conseil qu√©b√©cois pour la diffusion du cin√©ma had decided to distribute an unlicensed copy of the film, he chose not to take legal measures, and released an edited version of the film.

Early life De Lamar was born in Amsterdam to Maximiliaan de la Mar (1814‚Äì1847) and Johanna Teune (1816‚Äì1867). His father, a banker in Amsterdam, died when Joseph had just turned four years old.Genealogy of the De la Mar family In search of adventure, De Lamar stowed away aboard a Dutch vessel heading to the West Indies. When he was discovered, he was put to work without pay as assistant to the cook. De Lamar worked as a seaman until he was twenty, when he became master of a ship, and three years later received a captain's command. He visited many of the world's ports and acquired an education through his observations in foreign countries. He was attracted to submarine work, which was profitable owing to the American Civil War, so he abandoned the merchant service and became a submarine contractor. He was headquartered at Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, operating along the entire east coast to the West Indies. Maritime prosperity De Lamar received several contracts for raising sunken ships, and was very successful. In 1872 he raised the Charlotte, a transatlantic steamship that had foundered off the Bermudas loaded with Italian marble, and which had baffled the attempts of three previous wrecking companies. He nearly lost his life at Martha's Vineyard, going down in a diving suit to examine personally the damage to the Steamer William Tibbitts, in which he was imprisoned for thirty-six hours. This led De Lamar to give up submarine work. He then studied the opportunities of trade with Africa. Trading companies had confined their operations to the Coast, with natives from the interior bringing their goods to the Coast on the shoulders of bearers at considerable expense. De Lamar decided to do his trading in the interior. He equipped a small vessel capable of navigating the African rivers, stocked with goods and armed with four small cannon, a dozen blunderbusses, rifles and ammunition. He pushed into the interior, exercising constant vigilance to prevent attacks from hostile tribes. His venture was rewarded with complete success. He traded principally on the Gambia and Great Jeba Rivers in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa. After three successful years he gave up this trade because of the climate. Many of his crew died every year of African fever. He sold his outfit to an English company. Mining business In 1878 De Lamar came to New York, and when mining fever struck Leadville, Colorado, he went west and bought several claims. That same year he took a private course in chemistry and metallurgy from a professor from the Chicago University. In November 1879 he purchased the Terrible Lead Mine in Custer County, Colorado for $5500. It was bought from the discoverers of the deposit, John Bunyan Rains and John Spaulding. He operated it until 1885, at which time he sold to the Omaha & Grant Smelting and Refining Company for $130,0000, a handsome profit. He then obtained control of a mountain six miles west of Silver City, Idaho. Many large veins of gold and silver were discovered on the property, and he sold a half interest, after he had taken $1,500,000 from the mine, to the De Lamar Mining Company of England for $2,000,000. From Idaho, he turned his attention to the booming Cripple Creek district of Colorado. In 1893, De Lamar, together with Edward Holden, Charles M. MacNeill and George W. Peirce of the Golden Fleece Mine, had organized a company for starting the first barrel-chlorination plant in Colorado, and were about to rehabilitate an old stamp-mill a short distance below Victor, known as the Lawrence plant.Rickard, Thomas Arthur: Interviews with mining engineers. San Francisco Mining and Scientific Press, 1922. In the interview with Daniel C. Jackling (page 191-221), interesting details and notes on the barrel-chlorination process and mining activities in Colorado can be found. The conventional stamp mill in which the ore was crushed and the gold amalgamated with mercury was almost useless in refining Cripple Creek ore. At first, the process didn't work well, but it was improved by John Rothwell, a consultant who was the foremost expert on chlorination at the time. A young Daniel C. Jackling was hired as assayer through Charles MacNeill, the start of his noted career. In December 1895, the chlorination mill at Lawrence burned to the ground. De Lamar by then had transferred his focus to Mercur, Utah.Originally published in the Red Rock Rag, Volume 4 (No. 7), July 2003 and made available online with minor revisions . During 1896‚Äì97, De Lamar acquired claims within the gold district of Mercur and had built a 500-ton cyanide process mill, later expanded to 1,000 ton, which was said to be the largest of the time, to work the mines. Jackling followed DeLamar to Utah as mill superintendent. During his Cripple Creek and Mercur operations years, he also invested in gold mines in Lincoln County, Nevada, that from 1896 to 1902 paid him $8,000,000 in profits. At the Delamar Mine, Nevada, the barrel-chlorinating process was installed in 1895 and soon later discarded in favour of fine grinding and cyaniding.Information about Delamar, Nevada on Robert Howard Wynn‚Äôs ghost town seeker. In 1902, De Lamar sold his Mercur and De Lamar, Nevada mines, for one million dollars each. To his discredit, the operation in the mill at DeLamar created such a fine particulate during the milling process that many workers were killed by inhaling the dust, the focus of medical study and accusation of DeLamar's inconsideration of his laborer's safety. In the late 1890s, De Lamar had turned his attention to copper. While at Mercur, DeLamar became interested in the Bingham Canyon copper mines and sent Jackling and others to inspect the deposit. DeLamar would eventually acquire a portion of the canyon, but sold out to his former Cripple Creek partners, MacNeill and Spencer Penrose who would reap a fortune in copper at Bingham Canyon, Utah, with Jackling as their manager. In July 1899 De Lamar also purchased the Bully Hill mines, in the Shasta copper district of California, and financed the big copper smelter which was operating near there. A railroad project was installed to connect level 3 of the mine with the smelter, and the project became informally known as the DeLamar Railroad, which became part of the Sacramento Valley and Eastern Railway. Like his earlier operations, DeLamar unloaded the California property for a quick profit. Also, in 1901 he invested in mines near Yerington, Nevada and formed the Bluestone Mining & Smelting Company, one of his smaller yet still profitable operations sold after his death. He next turned to Canada, taking over the great copper nickel lodes of Sudbury, Ontario and organized the International Nickel Company (Inco), a multinational mining corporation. In 1905 he and his International Nickel partners bought into the Nipissing Mine, located in Cobalt, Ontario, 300 miles north of Toronto. In May 1906, they hit the famed \\"Silver Sidewalk,\\" a vein of nearly pure silver. DeLamar and his partners reportedly unloaded the property for $10 to $20 million. His next move was into the rich Porcupine district of Canada, where he became president of the Dome Mines Company, a long-term gold producer. As Inco, Dome and his other operations reached peak production during the high mineral market prices of World War I, he was one of the wealthiest men in America at the time of his death in 1918. Three former mining cities, which are today ghost towns, Delamar, Nevada, De Lamar, Idaho, and Delamar, California, were renamed after him; the last is now under water of Shasta Lake. The Delamar Mountains, a mountain range in Lincoln County, Nevada, as well a mountain summit in San Bernardino County, California, were also named after him. Delamar Mountain in California climbs to 8,376 feet (2,553.00 meters) above sea level. Other business De Lamar was one of the most noted traders in Wall Street for over twenty years, and one of the leading financiers in the country. Besides his many mining properties, he was president of the Delta Beet Sugar Company; a director of the American Bank Note Company, Coronate Phosphate Company, American Sumatra Tobacco Company, Manhattan Sugar Company, the National Conduit and Cable Company and the Western Power Company. Political career In 1891 De Lamar served as state senator in the first legislature of the new state of Idaho, and occupied the Chairmanship on Finance, Railroads and Constitutional Amendments. The Republican Party wanted him as their candidate for the U.S. Senate, but, as biographer G. W. Barrett shows, DeLamar was never interested in becoming the first U. S. Senator from Idaho and declined to continue in politics. He moved to New York. De Lamar was known in Wall Street as \\"the man of mystery.\\" He never talked much, his intimate friends say, but was uniformly successful in his transactions. He was part of the \\"community of interest\\" in big business that influenced politics, but he never again campaigned for office. Personal life J. R.'s only child, Alice DeLamar De Lamar married Nellie Virginia Sands on May 8, 1893, and they had one daughter together, Alice A. De Lamar. De Lamar was a member of the Lotus Club and the New York, Larchmont and Columbia Yacht Clubs. He was the owner of the yacht May and Sagitta, the fastest power boat on Long Island Sound. He was a great believer in aerial navigation and devoted considerable time to the study of the subject. De Lamar was also an art connoisseur, a collector of fine paintings, statuary and other art objects. He was also a lover of music, but his greatest delight was in the gathering of rare plants and flowers, of which he possessed a notable collection. He left a large sum, estimated at $10,000,000, to the Harvard University Medical School, Johns Hopkins University, and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University for research into the causes of disease and for the promulgation through lectures, publications, and otherwise of the principles of correct living. Joseph Raphael De Lamar House, at the corner at Madison Avenue and 37th Street His house on Madison Avenue, built in 1904 for a reported $600,000, is today a New York City landmark building. In 1914 he built an eighty-room manor house, \\"Pembroke\\", on Long Island in the town of Glen Cove; author Rex Beach filmed his 1910s movie Too Fat to Fly on its grounds. The home contained a cave, or grotto, encrusted with stalactites. A statue of a nude woman stood in the shallow water and was reflected in a mirror set deep in the cave. De Lamar died on December 1, 1918, at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. In the press release of his death, the news writers said \\"the story of Captain DeLamar's life reads like a romance.\\" In popular culture Joseph and Alice De Lamar's lives were the subject of the In Search of... season 4 episode, \\"The Missing Heirs\\".

It has four ice pads and is the official practice facility of the Toronto Maple Leafs NHL hockey team, and their AHL affiliate the Toronto Marlies. The building also houses offices for Hockey Canada and the Hockey Hall of Fame and was home to the Toronto Furies of the Canadian Women's Hockey League. The land is owned by the Toronto District School Board as 400 Kipling Avenue. Facility The Ford Performance Centre was built as a joint venture between the Toronto Maple Leafs, the City of Toronto government and the Lakeshore Lions Club at a cost of million, after cost overruns drove up the cost from $33.65 million, to replace the nearby Lakeshore Lions Arena. The Lions Club contributed $40 million to the project, with the city providing a $35.5 million loan guarantee. The Toronto District School Board leased the land for the arena to the Lakeshore Lions for a 50-year term. Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE) spent a further $5 million on training and medical facilities to make the building the practice rink of their two hockey teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Marlies. The Toronto Maple Leafs Hockey School is also held at the arena. MLSE pays $600,000 annually to rent the building. Mastercard purchased the naming rights to the facility for $525,000 a year. The facility, which is located at 400 Kipling Avenue in the New Toronto neighbourhood of Toronto, opened in September 2009. It has four NHL-sized rinks, one of which can be expanded to Olympic dimensions with 1000 seats, as well as extensive training facilities. According to Mastercard, the arena is \\"the first community ice facility to be built in the Toronto-area in the last 25 years.\\" The arena was originally operated by the Lakeshore Lions Club, but in June 2011, with the arena unable to deal with its rising debt and on the verge of defaulting, the City of Toronto decided to take control and assume its $43.4 million debt. The arena had planned to have a restaurant and sporting goods store at the facility, but were unable to find a tenant leading to the financial difficulties. The city established the Lakeshore Arena Corporation, an arms-length corporation, on September 8, 2011, to take over the running of the arena, with the intention to return it to private management within 2‚Äì3 years. A city councillor suggested that MLSE, which operates BMO Field and the CNE Coliseum on behalf of the city, would be \\"the logical party\\" to take over the arena, and a spokesperson for the company said \\"while we don‚Äôt have any interest in purchasing the facility, we are open to discussing the possibility of managing the facility on behalf of the City of Toronto. MLSE's executive vice president of venues and entertainment Bob Hunter said they would bid for the right to run the building. After the arena's original loans expired and it was unable to find refinancing, the city provided a short-term loan. In November 2015, after finding that the debt was unsustainable, the city voted to write off $8.1 million of the $40 million it was owed by the arena. The arena is used by Hockey Canada for its national teams, as well as by numerous visiting National Hockey League teams. The NHL Alumni Association is also based at the Ford Performance Centre. The rink is also available for ice rentals by the public for leagues, tournaments, private rentals and special events. The Faustina Hockey Club offers both community house league and Select Hockey programs at the Ford Performance Centre. On Saturdays from September through June, Ford provides open, free ice skating for families. In 2011, it was the host venue for the third season of the CBC reality figure skating competition Battle of the Blades, and subsequently hosted the fourth season in 2013. The venue hosted an international short track competition for the first time in November 2015. In the first half of 2019, Ford acquired the naming rights to the facility for an undisclosed amount, renaming it the Ford Performance Centre. D.K.

History and architecture The parish was founded in 1858, and their original church was a simple brick structure built on part of the current lot, but the congregation soon outgrew it. A new Late Victorian Gothic Revival-style church was built between 1876 and 1884 designed by Jeremiah O'Rourke and the Rev. George Deshon, a military engineer trained at West Point, who took over the project six years into construction when O'Rourke died,, p.240 and probably simplified the design. Rev Isaac Hecker, who founded the Paulist Fathers, may have had a hand in its design as well, using the thirteenth-century Cathedral of Santa Croce, Florence as a model. The building utilized Tarrytown grey granite stones salvaged from the Croton Aqueduct along with stones from other structures in Manhattan. The granite for the stone entrance steps was salvaged from the French Second Empire-style Booth‚Äôs Theatre on Sixth Avenue at 23rd Street. The new building was dedicated on January 25, 1885,Stern, Robert A. M.; Mellins, Thomas; and Fishman, David. New York 1880: Architecture and Urbanism in the Gilded Age.

The New York Daily Tribune reviewed the architecture as \\"vast, plain, fortress-like in its solidity‚Äîalmost repelling in the aesthetic cast without and within, yet it is the most August, unworldly interior of this continent.\\" The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, and designated a New York City Landmark in 2013.Postal, Matthew A. \\"Church of St. Paul the Apostle Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (June 25, 2013) A major renovation and restoration of the church was begun around 2000, and as of 2013 is still underway. Parish In 1858, the Paulist Fathers first took possession of a frame house containing a small chapel at 14 West 60th Street.\\"Church of St. Paul the Apostle, New York\\", Paulist Fathers The community‚Äôs motherhouse is on West 59th Street, adjacent to the church. The present building dates from the 1930s. The life of the parish has mirrored the growth, decline and rebirth of the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. In 1903 the 9th Avenue elevated train ran directly in front of the church. In the 1930s, the Paulists launched the radio station WLWL. It was greatly impacted by creation of the Lincoln Center just two blocks to the north. The parish opened an elementary school in 1886 and a high school in 1922. The parish's last school closed in 1974. The parish went through a financially difficult period in the 1960s and 1970s, with the possibility of bankruptcy in 1973, and razing the church for an apartment building was briefly considered. The church sold the western part of their lot in the mid-1980s, and was able to build a new Parish Center at 405 West 59th Street by selling its air rights to enable the building of a 40-story apartment tower, which sits close to the church's south tower. Today, the parish, with six Masses each Sunday, has a large young professionals community and a Spanish-speaking community. It also hosts a bookstore and gift shop at the east end of the nave. St. Paul the Apostle serves as the parish for Catholic students at nearby Fordham University, the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and the Juilliard School. The large church basement has been used as a cafeteria for the parish school, a homeless shelter, soup kitchen, rehearsal space for The Rockettes and for boxing matches. From 1996‚Äì2001, it was the home of the multi-annual Big Apple Comic Convention. M√∂ller pipe organ M.P. M√∂ller Pipe Organ Company's Opus 9987, built in 1965. The organ at The Church of St. Paul the Apostle is M.P. M√∂ller Pipe Organ Company's Opus 9987, built in 1965. With 4,965 pipes, the instrument has 4 manuals (keyboards), 83 ranks, and 78 stops. Twelve of the stops are made up of pipework from the church's previous instrument, E.M. Skinner Opus 544, built in 1925. The organ speaks from two different parts of the room, giving the effect of two instruments in one. At the front of the sanctuary, with large pedal towers that surround the high altar, sits the main organ. Perched on the south wall of the sanctuary is the nave organ. Both organs are playable simultaneously from one French-style console, built by the Peragallo Pipe Organ Company in 2000, which rests on a movable platform.

Earth has had some time to prepare for the Posleen invasion, but it may not be enough to stop the onslaught.  Synopsis  Gust Front follows a series of characters as they prepare for the looming Posleen invasion of Earth. The main protagonist is Captain Michael O'Neal, Medal of Honor recipient and hero of the battle against the Posleen on Diess. Other major characters include O'Neal's father, \\"Papa\\" O'Neal, and his daughter, Cally O'Neal, as well as various military personnel and civilians who are affected by the invasion. The Galactic Federation, an alliance of alien races including the Darhel, Indowy, Himmit, and others, has enlisted the aid of the warlike but technologically backward humans to halt the galactic advance of the Posleen, a race of centaur-like aliens who live only for battle, consuming their own and their enemies' dead and stripping conquered planets of resources.  Plot  The story begins with O'Neal and various military and civilian personnel taking steps to prepare for the looming Posleen invasion. O'Neal is tasked by the commander of the U.S. defenses with training a battalion of Armored Combat Suits, the most technologically-advanced units in Earth's possession. Other military personnel, including military leaders, combat engineers, and local space defense forces, are also in the midst of preparations for the imminent invasion. The story also includes glimpses of how the Posleen, even before their landing, have already changed civilian human society. In addition, it becomes clear that there are ongoing plots within the Federation as Darhel, Indowy, and human factions jockey for power and control of resources. A relatively small Posleen invasion force arrives earlier than expected, throwing human preparations into disarray. The landings occur in central Africa, western Asia, southeastern Asia, and the eastern United States. The battles in Asia are shown briefly in character point-of-views, but Africa is only mentioned in passing. The major focus of the novel is the battle in the mid-Atlantic United States. Initially the Posleen focus their assault on Fredericksburg, VA, where combat engineers and local militia construct a series of traps to slow the aliens' advance and cause as many casualties as possible. After overcoming the defenders in Fredericksburg, VA, the Posleen forces in the U.S. split, with some forces heading north toward Washington, D.C., and others heading south to Richmond, VA. The President of the U.S. overrides his military advisers and orders the United States' 9th and 10th Army Corps to cross the Potomac river and engage the Posleen in northern Virginia. This maneuver goes against established military doctrine for fighting the Posleen and results in the almost complete destruction of the 9th Army Corps and the rout of the 10th Army Corps, both of which retreat north toward Washington, D.C., and the relative safety of the Potomac river. Meanwhile, combat engineers prepare Shockoe Bottom in Richmond, VA, as a deathtrap, luring the Posleen forces into a kill-zone in the city. The Posleen forces take the bait and the southern portion of their invasion force is almost completely destroyed in battle in Richmond. During the battles, it becomes clear that an outside force, not human or Posleen, has been interfering with human preparations for battle against the Posleen. A clandestine group of humans, Indowy, and Himmit, called Bane Sidhe, whose mission is to subvert Darhel control of the Galactic Federation, send a group of specially trained monks to protect \\"Papa\\" and Cally O'Neal from a would-be assassin. Throughout the story it is hinted that the Darhel are not as benevolent as they seem and their purposes may be at odds with the humans'. After a series of desperate rearguard actions, the last units of the 9th and 10th Army Corps retreat across the Potomac river into Washington, D.C. However, the Posleen are able to secure a bridge across the river before it can be destroyed, and their capture of the city is only prevented by the timely arrival of Captain O'Neal's Armored Combat Suit battalion and a brave stand at the Washington Monument by rejuvenated Medal of Honor recipients and the remainder of the 9th and 10th Army Corps. The President of the U.S. is caught by a Posleen lander near the end of the fighting and is killed attempting to protect refugees. Captain O'Neal and his allies in the military leadership are vindicated in the aftermath of the battle as it becomes clear that the incompetence of several military leaders led to the disastrous rout in northern Virginia.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 24, 2010. The episode was written by David X. Cohen and Matt Groening, and directed by Frank Marino. \\"Rebirth\\" directly follows the ending of the final Futurama film Into the Wild Green Yonder, in which the entire crew enter a wormhole. The episode is the first to feature the opening sequence in high definition format. It was also the first to feature the remix version of the theme playing in the end credits. The episode begins with the Planet Express ship crash landing on Earth, killing many of the main characters. Professor Farnsworth, who survived the crash, revives the others using a \\"birth machine\\". However, a complication with Leela's rebirth results in her remaining in an irreversible coma. Out of loneliness and despair, Fry creates a robotic version of Leela, containing her memories, and they attempt to resume their relationship. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Plot The episode opens with Fry walking into Professor Farnsworth's laboratory, asking why he is covered in severe burns. The Professor explains that when the crew entered a wormhole at the end of Into the Wild Green Yonder, they emerged near Earth. Zapp Brannigan also emerged from the wormhole aboard the Nimbus flagship and damaged the Planet Express Ship, causing both ships to crash. Having survived the crash, the Professor revives everyone killed in the crash using a \\"birth machine\\" filled with stem cells. Leela, however, enters an irreversible coma. Meanwhile, Bender is reborn lacking adequate power supply to function. The Professor fits him with a doomsday device to power him, but it generates excess power. Bender is forced to party endlessly to burn off the excess energy. Otherwise, he will explode. A despairing Fry builds a robotic version of Leela, featuring her personality and memories, but this Robot Leela learns the truth almost immediately afterwards when Nibbler bites her arm, revealing robot circuitry underneath, and gets confused over her own identity. As per her final wishes, the human Leela is taken to a planet to be eaten by a cyclops-devouring monster called the Cyclophage. At the service, Bender's obnoxious partying wakes Leela, who is horrified by the existence of Robot Leela. The Cyclophage approaches, and the crew escapes in the ship. The Cyclophage accidentally attaches itself to the underside of the ship as it takes off. Back on Earth, both Leelas refuse to talk to Fry because of the \\"freakiness\\" of the situation. Later that night, Fry professes his love of Leela, which the human Leela overhears. She reconciles with Fry, but a jealous Robot Leela attacks the other Leela. Fry is given a gun and told to shoot one but accidentally shoots himself, only to expose that he is also a robot. The Professor reveals that Fry was killed in the crash while shielding Leela, who survived. Fry's remains were placed in the birth machine, but to no avail. Leela, distraught over Fry's death, made a robotic version of him. However, a malfunction electrocuted Leela and severely burned the robot Fry. A reborn Fry suddenly emerges from the birth machine. Robot Fry and Robot Leela declare their love for each other, and leave together, leaving human Fry to tell human Leela that he will wait as long as it takes for her. Bender decides he is fed up with constantly partying and begins to vibrate from the buildup of excess energy. The Cyclophage suddenly emerges and attempts to eat Leela. Bender's severe vibrations cause one of his eyes to fall out, and the Cyclophage swallows Bender, believing him to be a cyclops. The device explodes, killing the creature. Bender emerges intact and the Professor declares that Bender expended his excess energy and is now stable. The crew leave to celebrate as the Futurama theme plays, ending the episode with Zapp Brannigan rapidly emerging from the birth machine. Production On June 9, 2009, 20th Century Fox announced that Comedy Central had picked up the show for 26 new half-hour episodes to begin airing in mid-2010. A smaller writing crew returned. It was originally announced that main voice actors Billy West, John DiMaggio, and Katey Sagal would return as well, but on July 17, 2009, it was announced that a casting notice was posted to replace the entire cast when 20th Century Fox Television would not meet their salary demands. Many fans were disheartened to see that the cast was not at the Futurama booth at San Diego Comic-Con International. According to Phil LaMarr (who voiced Hermes on the show), the cast's invitation was retracted by Fox because of a dispute over the salaries. Near the end of a message from Maurice LaMarche that was sent to members of the \\"Save the Voices of Futurama\\" group on Facebook, LaMarche announced that the original cast would indeed be returning for the new episodes. The Toronto Star confirmed, announcing on their website that the original cast of Futurama have signed contracts with Fox to return for 26 more episodes.Salem, Rob. \\"Futurama cast members ink new deal with Fox\\", TheStar.com, July 31, 2009 Similarly, an email sent to fans from Cohen and Groening reported that West, Sagal, DiMaggio, LaMarche, MacNeille, Tom, LaMarr, and Herman would all be returning for the revival, set to air in June 2010. Cohen told Newsday in August 2009 that the reported 26-episode order means, \\"It will be up to 26. I can't guarantee it will be 26. But I think there's a pretty good chance it'll be exactly 26. Fox has been a little bit cagey about it, even internally. But nobody is too concerned. We're plunging ahead\\".Lovece, Frank. \\"'Futurama' finds a new future on Comedy Central\\", Newsday, August 28, 2009; posted online August 27, 2009 Two episodes were in the process of being voice-recorded at that time, with an additional \\"six scripts ... in the works, ranging in scale from 'it's a crazy idea that someone's grandmother thought of' to 'it's all on paper'. ...\\"The first episode is tentatively titled 'Rebirth' ‚Äî and in a surprisingly literal fashion, as things turn out\\". Cohen's original concept for the return episode involved continuing directly from the end of Into the Wild Green Yonder. Fry and Leela would find themselves on a lush, beautiful world in a distant part of the galaxy. Before they begin to kiss, they would discover that they were in a zoo, placed there by aliens interested in breeding more humans. However, Matt Groening suggested that they instead write a story quickly bringing the characters back to Planet Express in order to more fully depict that the series had returned. Cohen agreed, feeling that a quick return to the settings of the series would help viewers unfamiliar with the previous films adjust with little difficulty. The episode also marks Frank Marino's directorial debut for Futurama. Previous to that, Marino had done some timing work on the Futurama films, Drawn Together, and children's cartoons. Bender's plot where he always needed to be partying was challenging for the production team, who attempted to make his actions diverse in different scenes to keep it interesting while simultaneously trying to avoid being too distracting. Zapp Brannigan's return was also a last minute addition, as each draft neglected to explain how he regains his full body. Groening suggested the last minute tag- on. In the original airing, the episode begins with Bender's voice announcing that people will forget the series was ever cancelled \\"by idiots\\" and later revived \\"by bigger idiots.\\" In subsequent airings and on the Futurama: Volume 5 DVD, Bender instead announces a test of \\"the Emergency Hypnotoad System\\" (on the DVD version, the original aired version of the opening can be found as an extra). Cultural references During the episode there are references to Huey Lewis and Star Trek as well as Frankenstein, Saturday Night Fever, The Outer Limits (1995 TV series), The Terminator, Karma Chameleon and Studio 54.Lanther, Joseph (June 20, 2010) http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/futurama/187 Slant Retrieved 2010-06-24 The rebirthing process is very similar to The Outer Limits episode \\"Resurrection\\" where an adult human is born in a lab. The club the crew visits is called Studio 122133.

Robot Leela's realization of her true identity as a robot was thematic of the trope in science fiction, such as in The Six Million Dollar Man and Blade Runner. The Panama wormhole the Professor mentions is a reference to the canal that is the key conduit for international maritime trade, the Panama Canal.

Kak ya provyol etim letom) is a 2010 Russian drama film directed by Alexei Popogrebski. It was critically acclaimed and garnered several awards and nominations; it was in the competition for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival. Plot Meteorology student Pavel \\"Pasha\\" Danilov (Grigoriy Dobrygin) is spending the summer as an intern at an isolated, Soviet-era weather station on a remote Arctic island with only the older, experienced geophysicist Sergei Gulybin (Sergei Puskepalis) for company. Their sole job is to collect the weather and tide statistics every four hours on antiquated equipment, which they do in shifts, and report the readings by radio to the state meteorology center. Pasha is respectful and friendly, but he is afraid of the gruff Sergei, who is condescending to him, as he resents Pasha's temporary stay and is jealous that he knows how to operate their only computer. Sergei takes the boat on an unauthorized fishing trip for a few days, and tells Pasha not to mention this. When the radio operator urgently requests to speak with Sergei, Pasha dutifully makes up excuses why he cannot come on the radio. Eventually Pasha is told to take down a radiogram that Sergei's wife and young son have been \\"gravely injured\\" in an accident, although it is apparent they've been killed. He is told that a ship Academic Obruchev is headed to get them and instructed to simply give Sergei the message and then \\"leave him alone.\\" The sad news keeps Pasha awake, but when he does sleep he oversleeps; the data goes unrecorded. Seeing Sergei's boat, he hastily grabs the logbook to fill in fake numbers, and in doing so knocks his radiogram under the desk. When Sergei comes ashore with the trout, he is in a good mood. He tells Pasha a warm story about his wife craving salted trout during her pregnancy. Pasha starts to say something, but Sergei interrupts and teaches him how to properly fillet a fish. Once inside, Sergei quickly figures out that the Pasha made up the numbers in the log and explodes in anger, dragging Pasha inside and berating him. He tells him that the station has been continuously occupied since 1935, and that no matter how bad the conditions got, never had anyone just faked the numbers out of sheer laziness, and that now all their work is worthless. He accuses Pasha of being a \\"tourist\\" in the Arctic in order to write a pointless essay, \\"How I Ended This Summer\\" (a play on the clich√©d \\"How I Spent My Summer Vacation.\\") Sergei tells him an intimidating story about the time one geophysicist apparently killed the other due to their strained relationship. The frightened Pasha does not tell Sergei about his family and temporarily sabotages the radio. When Sergei leaves to get more trout, Pasha is told that the ship is stuck in ice, but that a helicopter will instead come before the weather worsens. Pasha, carrying a rifle, heads to the lagoon to meet the helicopter. Upon hearing the rotors of the helicopter, Pasha lights a flare, but the pilot cannot see the flare due to heavy fog and flies away. Pasha then notices bear footprints. Following the tracks with his eyes, he sees the distinct white shape of a polar bear. He runs a short distance, and notices that the bear is chasing him. He flees, and begins to descend a steep embankment, and subsequently trips. Pasha wakes up in Sergei's boat. As they disembark, Pasha tries to confess to Sergei that he needs to tell him something but Sergei ignores him. Pasha finally blurts out to Sergei that his family is dead. Sergei turns around and comes toward him, and Pasha, frightened and with an injured leg, falls to the ground. Thinking Sergei is going to attack him, Pasha fires at him but misses. He then gets up and runs away while Sergei picks up his gun and fires at him, and then keeps shooting into the air. Pasha takes up residence in an old abandoned cabin. He wakes up to hear Sergei outside and hides, still afraid. Sergei calls to him and says he wants to talk to him. Sergei, who is carrying his rifle, hears Pasha step on something that makes a large cracking sound. Thinking Pasha fired at him, he fires his own rifle. The terrified Pasha runs away. Pasha, freezing, huddles by an old isotope beacon to keep warm before realizing he has exposed himself to radiation. He sneaks into the cabin when Sergei is away and tries to contact the main station for help but cannot reach anyone. Starving, he steals Sergei's fish and nearly chokes to death on a fishbone. He screams and curses Sergei. He hangs fish up on the isotope beacon; he later sneaks back into the cabin and replaces Sergei's stash of fish with the contaminated fish. One night Sergei sees the disheveled Pasha looking in the cabin window watching him eat the fish. He signals to Pasha to come inside, and then invites him to sit down and have some fish. He says the Academic Obruchev made it through the ice after all and will be there in three days. Pasha confesses that the fish has been contaminated. Sergei says nothing, but goes to vomit up the fish he has just eaten. Pasha checks the cupboard and sees Sergei has eaten all of the contaminated fish. Sergei returns and says only that they don't have to tell anyone what has happened. 3 days later, two men help secure the reactor to a helicopter, which then flies away to the Academic, which has reached the island. Sergei tells Pasha he plans to stay on the island. Pasha threatens to tell what has happened to force Sergei to get medical help. Sergei grabs Pasha, and hugs him, telling him that he needs to stay on the island alone.

Critic Philip French of The Guardian praised the film, calling it a \\"tense allegory about modern Russia.\\" He said Dobrygin and Puskepalis rightfully deserved their awards for their performances in the isolated setting, writing that \\"They almost seem like the last survivors in a post-apocalyptic world\\" and that he sees \\"Sergei and Pavel as representing different sides of Putin's Russia, one shaped by older traditional ways, the other struggling to discover a new set of values.\\" Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph gave it four stars, writing, that the director Popogrebsky \\"delivers a Tarkovskian parable about nuclear horror which also functions as a sustained and nail-biting psychological thriller.\\" Awards *60th Berlin International Film Festival **Silver Bear for Best Actor: Grigoriy Dobrygin and Sergei Puskepalis **Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution (Camera): Pavel Kostomarov *7th Yerevan Golden Apricot International Film Festival **Jury Diploma *2010 London Film Festival **Best Film *46th Chicago International Film Festival **Gold Hugo ‚Äî Best Film * Golden Eagle Award ** Golden Eagle ‚Äî Best Film References External links  Category:2010 films Category:2010 drama films Category:Russian films Category:Russian drama films Category:Russian- language films Category:Films directed by Alexei Popogrebski Category:Best Film, London Film Festival winners Category:Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution ","title":"How I Ended This Summer"},{"id":"26109573","text":"The Church of St Gregory the Great is a Roman Catholic parish located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City.

The present church, built 1912/1913 for around $120,000, was designed by Elliott Lynch as a parochial school in a mid-block location on 90th Street.Office for Metropolitan History, \\"Manhattan NB Database 1900-1986,\\" (Accessed 5 Feb 2010). The school was dedicated by Cardinal Farley on October 19, 1913; although church accommodation in the ground floor was intended as temporary until a permanent church could be erected on the corner of Amsterdam Avenue and 90th Street. During World War I, 28 of 700 parishioner servicemen died. Plans for a separate church were abandoned and renovations to the structure began in 1918 and the unused fourth floor was converted into a rectory; also installed were an elevator, a sky-lit gallery and later a library and roof garden with fish pond. By the 1960s, nearly a third of the congregation was Hispanic. During the two year pastorate of Father Henry J. Browne, the church increased as a center of activism on behalf of the working class and opposition to the Vietnam war. Bus trips to Washington, D.C., were organized so parishioners could attend peace vigils and anti-war protests. Fr. Browne championed affordable housing and battled a proposed Alexander's department store on Broadway. In April 1970, the anti-war Rev. Philip F. Berrigan, S.S.J., (1923‚Äì2002), wanted by the FBI for destroying draft files and failing to surrender for his prison term, arrived at St. Gregory's to address a peace rally. While Berrigan was staying at the rectory, located on the fourth floor of the church, the FBI broke down the church's door to arrest him.\\"Dunlap, David W.

The Sisters of Charity would serve the school until 1943. That year they were replaced by the Presentation Sisters who ran the school until the late 1980s. The nuns resided on 88th Street between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West. The parish school still numbered slightly over 250 students in the 1950s. By the early 1990s, the school had been listed as one of 41 parochial schools in danger of closing. However, the Parish Council voted unanimously to keep it open.  Description  The St. Gregory the Great building is a four-story structure, designed by Elliott Lynch as a parish school with the church occupying the ground floor. Externally, above the doors are statues of St. Gregory the Great and St. Sylvia. Plans for building a separate church nearby were abandoned during the interwar years and the spartan ornamentation of the school building‚Äôs ground floor-turned church was gradually augmented with reused works from churches that had either closed or been remodeled. The charming temporary-turned-permanent appeal includes painted timber wainscoting, a number of mosaic portraits and some substantial stained glass windows. Groups of angels are clustered in the sanctuary and around the organ, although only one is signed by Louis F. Bernecker. Large canvas paintings of a parade of saints are affixed around the sanctuary, ‚Äúpainted in the late 1920s and 1930s (though none is dated or signed) by Father Gustave de Leon, a priest in the parish between 1921 and 1944‚Ä¶. The choice of saints seems to reflect three influences: the predominance of Irish, French and German ancestry among the parishioners; the interest in those recently canonized or beatified during the time this art work was done (approximately 1920-1945); the gratitude of the parish toward the Order of the Visitation and its affiliate, the Sisters of Charity, who staffed St. Gregory's School until 1943.‚Äù \\"The Art of St. Gregory‚Äôs \\" Social programs St. Gregory's runs a soup kitchen with nearby Advent Lutheran in that church's basement.

Interior Interior The church is constructed of American, European, and African marbles, including pink Tennessee, red-veined Numidian, yellow Siena, pink Algerian marble, white Carrara marble, and veined Pavonazzo marble; most of the intricate marble work was executed by the firm of James G. Batterson, Jr., and John Eisele of New York.

Washington, D.C., May 1970, pp. 549‚Äì556.https://sites.google.com/site/hotworkultrasonicbonding Owing to the well proven reliability of thermosonic bonds, it is extensively used to connect the central processing units (CPUs), which are encapsulated silicon integrated circuits that serve as the \\"brains\\" of today's computers. Description A thermosonic bond is formed using a set of parameters which include ultrasonic, thermal and mechanical (force) energies. A thermosonic bonding machine includes a magnetostrictive or piezoelectric-type transducer which is used to convert electrical energy into vibratory motion which is known as piezoelectricity. The vibratory motion travels along the coupler system, a portion which is tapered to serve as the velocity transformer. The velocity transformer amplifies the oscilliatory motion and delivers it to a heated bonding tip. It is akin to a friction bond, since the introduction of ultrasonic energy (via a bonding tool vertically attached to an ultrasonic transformer or horn) simultaneously delivers a force and vibratory or scrubbing motion to the interfacial contact points between a pre-heated deforming lead-wire and the metallized pads of a silicon integrated circuit (Figure 2). In addition to the delivery of thermal energy, the transmission of ultrasonic vibratory energy creates an ultrasonic softening effect by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the preheated lead wire. These two softening effects dramatically facilitates the lead wire deformation by forming the desirable contact area using relatively low temperatures and forces. As a result of the frictional action and ultrasonic softening induced in the preheated lead wire during the bonding cycle, thermosonic bonding can be used to reliably bond high melting point lead wires (such as gold and lower cost aluminum and copper) using relatively low bonding parameters. This ensures that the fragile and costly silicon integrated circuit chip is not exposed to potentially damaging conditions by having to use higher bonding parameters (ultrasonic energy, temperatures or mechanical forces) to deform the lead wire in forming the required contact area during the bonding process. Background Wires bonded to a silicon integrated circuit using thermosonic bonding A thermosonic bond falls in the category of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid- state bonding machines where he pre-heated the lead wire (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing an ultrasonic energy cycle. In addition to thermal softening the lead wire, the subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the heated wire (known as ultrasonic softening).F. Blaha, B. Langenecker. Acta Metallurgica, 7 (1957). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre- heating lead wire and deliverying the ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state bonding machines. The improvement occurs because pre- heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of the lead wire, the onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of the deforming wire can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of the lead wire where it aids in the softening effect. If the wire was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip. Thermosonic bonding, initially referred to as Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding by Alexander Coucoulas, was found to bond a wide range of conductive metals such as aluminum and copper wires to tantalum and palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide and glass substrates all of which simulated the metallized silicon chip. Applications  At present, the majority of connections to the silicon integrated circuit chip are made using thermosonic bondingHarman, G., Wire Bonding In Microelectronics, McGraw-Hill, Ch. 2, p. 36 because it employs lower bonding temperatures, forces and dwell times than thermocompression bonding, as well as lower vibratory energy levels and forces than ultrasonic bonding to form the required bond area. Therefore the use of thermosonic bonding eliminates damaging the relatively fragile silicon integrated circuit chip during the bonding cycle. The proven reliability of thermosonic bonding has made it the process of choice, since such potential failure modes could be costly whether they occur during the manufacturing stage or detected later, during an operational field-failure of a chip which had been connected inside a computer or a myriad of other microelectronic devices. Thermosonic bonding is also used in the flip chip process which is an alternate method of electrically connecting silicon integrated circuits. Josephson effect and superconducting interference (DC SQUID) devices use the thermosonic bonding process as well. In this case, other bonding methods would degrade or even destroy YBaCuO‚Çá microstructures, such as microbridges, Josephson junctions and superconducting interference devices (DC SQUID). When electrically connecting light-emitting diodes with thermosonic bonding techniques, an improved performance of the device has been shown.Seck-Hoe Wong et al.

She is also known for singing the song \\"Baby Mine\\" in the Disney film Dumbo (1941), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. However, she was not given screen credit for this performance. (None of the voice actors for Dumbo were credited on screen.) Known career Noyes began her career in 1938 in The Debutantes, a trio of young women in the Ted Fio Rito big band. They made the original recording of \\"My Little Grass Shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii.\\" As a member of The Debutantes (with Marjorie Briggs, Dottie Hill and Dorothy Compton), she contributed vocals for Candy Candido and the Debutantes. In 1947, she was in a quartet called \\"The Girlfriends,\\" a regular feature on several NBC Radio programs, including The Bill Goodwin Show, The Carnation Contented Hour, and with Bing Crosby. Norma Zimmer, Lawrence Welk's \\"Champagne Lady,\\" was also in the group. Noyes and other members of the quartet became \\"First Call\\" studio singers and can be heard on many movie musicals for two decades, including The Wizard of Oz (1939), White Christmas (1954), and The Sound of Music (1965). She also appeared on-camera in several movies and television series, including regular appearances on The Dinah Shore Show and an episode of I Love Lucy titled \\"Lucy Goes to Scotland.\\" She appeared as a mother who sings a brief solo in the 1965 television movie Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella, along with fellow dubber Bill Lee.

Initially the Legislative Council consisted of 16 members: the British Governor, the five appointed members of the Executive Council of Ceylon, four other government officials and six appointed unofficial members (three Europeans, one Sinhalese, one Tamil and one Burgher). In 1889 the number of appointed unofficial members was increased to eight (three Europeans, one Low Country Sinhalese, one Kandyan Sinhalese, one Tamil, one Muslim and one Burgher). The Legislative Council was reformed in 1910 by the McCallum Reforms. Membership was increased to 21 of which 11 were officially appointed and 10 were unofficial (two elected Europeans, one elected Burgher, one elected educated Ceylonese, two appointed Low Country Sinhalese, two appointed Tamils, one appointed Kandyan Sinhalese and one appointed Muslim). Less than 3,000 Ceylonese were eligible to vote for the four elected unofficial members. Further reforms were enacted in 1920 by the First Manning Reforms. Membership was increased to 37 of which 14 were officially appointed and 23 were unofficial (11 elected on a territorial basis, five elected Europeans, two elected Burghers, one elected to represent the Chamber of Commerce, two appointed Kandyan Sinhalese, one appointed Muslim and one appointed Indian Tamil.

This exhaust setup is known for its loud noise.  Principle of operation  To regulate the boost pressure on turbocharged engines a wastegate is fitted to allow exhaust gases to bypass the turbine and flow straight down the exhaust down-pipe. This can cause turbulent airflow around the turbine and high exhaust back pressure. To overcome this problem, gases can be re-routed down a separate pipe and vented straight to the atmosphere, resulting in improved performance.  Limitations  This configuration allows exhaust gases to flow straight to the atmosphere, therefore they do not pass through the catalytic converter or exhaust silencer, which renders it illegal for street use in many countries owing to noise and exhaust emission regulations. Although exhaust emission laws do not apply away from the public highways in most countries, many race tracks have strict noise rules in place, once again outlawing screamer pipe use.

This piece of the Earth's crust has experienced several episodes of mountain building or 'orogenies', each of which has added further complexity to the picture. A wide range of geological structures occur across Britain and include examples at a variety of scales of: *faults *thrust faults *folds *sedimentary basins *grabens and horsts *unconformities Our understanding of Britain's large-scale structure has been gained over many decades by simple geological field survey together with an increasing range of technological methods including gravity surveys, seismic surveys, aeromagnetic surveys and other forms of remote sensing. Terranes A useful approach to considering Britain's geological structure is to examine the various terranes from which it is composed. These are essentially continental fragments whose boundaries are generally defined by faults. Individual terranes typically contain suites of structures, the histories and form of which differ from those of neighbouring terranes. Terranes of Scotland The Hebridean Terrane is defined to the east by the Moine Thrust, beyond which lies the Northern Highlands Terrane. This area in turn abuts against the Central Highlands (or Grampian) Terrane along the Great Glen Fault. Similarly the Highland Boundary Fault separates the Central Highlands Terrane from the Midland Valley Terrane, which is itself separated from the Central - Southern Uplands Terrane by the Southern Uplands Fault. Each of these terranes form a part of the former continent of Laurentia whose southeastern margin is defined by the Iapetus Suture Zone, which runs parallel to the English-Scottish border, though some miles to its south. Terranes of England and Wales The Central - Southern Uplands Terrane extends across the northernmost part of England. Its southern margin is the Iapetus Suture, south of which lies the Leinster - Lakesman Terrane which includes the Lake District and North Pennines. The majority of the rest of England and Wales north of the Variscan Front are considered to constitute the Avalon Composite Terrane. Central to this composite terrane is the triangular-shaped Midlands Microcraton; within it, the north-south aligned Malvern Line (or 'Malvern Lineament') divides the Wrekin Terrane in the west from the Charnwood Terrane in the east. The Isle of Anglesey and parts of the Lleyn peninsula are deemed to be composed of numerous micro-terranes, known collectively as the Rosslare - Monian Terranes.British Geological Survey 1996 Tectonic map of Britain, Ireland and adjacent areas Pharaoh, T.C. et al 1:1,500,000 (Keyworth, Notts, BGS) Pennine Block & Basin Province Northern England is characterised by a series of fault-bound blocks separated by sedimentary basins whose origin can be traced back to the Carboniferous period. The North Pennines are formed on the Alston Block which is defined to the west by the Pennine Fault and to the north by the Stublick and Ninety Fathom Faults. It is separated from the Askrigg Block to the south by the Stainmore Trough. This latter block, coincident with the Yorkshire Dales, is defined to the west by the Dent Fault and to the south by the Craven Fault System. The Northumberland and Gainsborough Troughs lie to the north and south of these two blocks. Structural legacy of mountain-building episodes Another approach to the study of the geological structure of the area is through consideration of the variety of structures resulting from each of several orogenies (or 'mountain-building' episodes) which have taken place over geological history. Structures originating in one event may play a part in subsequent orogenic events and be modified by them. Thus lines of crustal weakness commonly associated with, for example, the Caledonian Orogeny will often predate this particular mountain-building period, much as some of those created during this phase were reactivated during later events. The Caledonian Orogeny The Caledonian Orogeny took place between about 490 and 390 million years ago as the former micro-continent of Avalonia collided obliquely with the former continent of Laurentia along a line approximating to the modern English-Scottish border. This long drawn-out, multi-phase event resulted in innumerable geological structures, many of which have persisted to the present day and help to shape the landscapes of much of Britain, from South Wales northwards to the Shetland Islands. Key structures include: :*Moine Thrust :*Great Glen Fault :*Walls Boundary Fault :*Highland Boundary Fault :*Midland Valley graben :*Southern Uplands Fault :*Menai Strait Fault Zone :*Bala Fault :*Welsh Borderland Fault System :*Cribarth Disturbance :*Neath Disturbance Each of these structures is aligned northeast - southwest, albeit with the more northerly of them trending closer to NNE - SSW. A map or satellite photo readily reveals these major trends. There are hundreds of other lesser faults and folds which follow a similar alignment - a trend known as the Caledonoid trend. The Variscan Orogeny The Variscan Orogeny was a complex affair whereby the former micro-continent of Armorica collided with Laurussia (otherwise known as Euramerica or the Old Red Continent), followed by a further collision between Gondwana and the enlarged Laurussia. In Britain it resulted in a variety of geological structures across the southwest from Pembrokeshire and South Glamorgan in Wales to Devon and Cornwall. Structures include: :*Dodman-Start Thrust :*Lizard Thrust :*Carrick Thrust The Alpine Orogeny inverted during the Alpine Orogeny forming the Wealden Anticline. Vertical exaggeration 1:5. The Alpine Orogeny began 200 million years ago and continues to the present day. It comprises a series of collisions involving various micro-continents between northern Europe and Africa. Its effects are most evident in the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians and other mountain ranges of southern Europe, but the northernmost 'ripples' of this event have affected the structure of southern England.

Plot Alison Kirbe is a young London girl who has just found out she has inherited a Texas ranch from an old soldier she had befriended during World War II. Mistakenly assuming she is now the owner of a small empire, she crosses the Atlantic Ocean by ship. On her way, she meets Terence Keath, a fellow passenger heavily in debt to casino owner Lucky Reilly. To pay off his debts, he attempts to marry rich and starts to seduce Alison, as he thinks she is a wealthy heiress. Another person who is attracted to Alison is Jeremy Taylor, a millionaire bachelor who is accompanied by his attorney Matthew Kinston. The following days she enjoys the attention she is receiving from Terence, Jeremy and Matthew, but rejects them all. She feels most attracted to Matthew, but he mistakenly confronts her for being part of a scheme. Trying to hurt Matthew, she borrows money from Terence and buys an expensive present for Jeremy, while posing as a wealthy heiress. After arriving in America, Alison decides to stay in New York for a week before traveling to Texas. Matthew, meanwhile, tries to find more information on the ranch she has inherited, which makes him suspect her of scheming Jeremy all the more. Matthew confronts Alison at a casino, where she is gambling with Terence and Jeremy. He soon apologizes, however, and they kiss not much later. Terence and Jeremy, who are witnesses of the kiss, are shocked that she prefers a pennyless attorney over them. The next day, Matthew finds out Alison's ranch is not worth anything and accuses her again of swindling Jeremy. Alison bursts out in tears, angry at Matthew for turning an honest and good-hearted inheritance into a supposed scheme. That night, Alison finds out about Terence's financial situation and tries to help him out by offering Reilly to pay off Terence's debts. It proves unnecessary, though, as Jeremy is prepared to pay for the entire debt. Afterwards, the three men rush to the hotel, where they propose to Alison all at the same time. Alison enthusiastically accepts Matthew's proposal and the other men soon move on, hitting on other women only moments later.

By that time, Deborah Kerr, Robert Walker and Peter Lawford were already cast. On June 14, 1949, Van Johnson was assigned in the remaining male lead, with shooting beginning a month later. Filming started with Johnson, but he was replaced by Mark Stevens in August 1949. The film was Val Lewton's first and only film for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. MGM was so satisfied with the script, that they offered to raise the budget and replace Kerr with June Allyson, who was more famous by that time. Lewton insisted on keeping Kerr, however. Reception According to MGM records, the film only earned $577,000 in the US and Canada and $192,000 overseas, resulting in a loss of $609,000.

Instituto Cartagenero de Investigaciones Hist√≥ricas, pp. 6-8 Sinking In the last days of the Spanish Civil War, Cartagena was one of the last Republican strongholds, which still harboured the bulk of the Republican fleet. When an anti-communist rebellion broke out, the Nationalists decided to send reinforcements, because the conquest of Cartagena and the capture of the Republican fleet would certainly bring the end of the war much closer. The Nationalists sent from Castell√≥n and M√°laga a convoy of 16 ships, containing more than 20,000 troops, with less than 48 hours preparation. The convoy was composed by the J√∫piter class minelayers J√∫piter, Marte and Vulcano, the auxiliary cruisers L√°zaro, Jaime I, Domine and J.J. Sister and the transports Castillo de Olite, San Sebasti√°n, Castillo Pe√±afiel, Gibraltar, Monforte, Mombeltr√°n, Huertas, Montealegre and Simancas.Fern√°ndez, p. 21 The Republican fleet had effectively left Cartagena for Oran, in Algeria, but the Republican Brigade 206 had retaken the port and its coastal defense batteries, thus preventing the Nationalist landing. The Nationalist ships retreated, except for the Castillo de Olite, which had not received the order to withdraw, because her radio was out of order.

The village, which is situated in the district of Celle has around 2220 inhabitants and is a very popular tourist centre, whose catchment area includes Hamburg, Bremen and Hanover. It is surrounded by large tracts of forest and heathland. The nearest big towns are L√ºneburg (60 km north), Soltau (30 km west), Uelzen (45 km east) and Celle (32 km south). The two rivers, the Wietze and the √ñrtze merge in M√ºden.  History   Middle Ages  The Heidesee lake. View of the eastern shore Confluence of the Wietze (left) and √ñrtze The great Hermannsburg pastor, revivalist and local historian, Ludwig Harms, believed there to be a shrine to the god, Thor at the confluence of the Wietze and √ñrtze rivers that, according to M√ºden historian Ernst Sch√ºtze, still existed around AD 800. In any case the Christianity had reached the area by the end of the 8th century and, according to Harms, there was already a wooden church in M√ºden in 866. The earliest written record of the village goes back to the year 1022. In the deed of gift by the Bishop of Hildesheim, Bernward, dated 1 November 1022 for the abbey of St. Michael in Hildesheim is the following statement: item Mutha in pago Muthiwide (\\"likewise M√ºden in the sub-district (Untergau) of M√ºndungswald\\"). Muthiwide, the Latinized form of the Old Saxon term Muthiwiddi (Muth = mouth) refers to the name of a sub-district in the Loingau. Gaus were established during the reign of Charlemagne around 793 as regional administrative units. The settlement of M√ºden was located on the border of the Loingau, which stretched from the area around the lower Leine river to the Sothriet, Rodau and √ñrtze, and had a northern border with the Bardengau. Until the middle of the 15th century the history of M√ºden was linked to the neighbouring village of Hermannsburg, with which it formed a common parish until 1440. The region was ruled by the House of Billung until the line died out, it then went over to the Guelphs and until 1866 belonged to the House of Hanover. The Reformation was introduced into M√ºden in 1530 by order of Ernest the Confessor. The population at that time was 119.  Early modern period  Little is known about the damage caused in M√ºden by the Thirty Years War. From parish bills during the years 1638 to 1650 it can however be deduced that there was destruction and plundering, because damage to the church had to be repaired and new communion items procured. In addition, the largest church bell was cracked and had to be recast. In 1839, on the introduction of land reforms in the Kingdom of Hanover, it became possible for the M√ºden farmers to release themselves from their manorial duties. To do that they had to pay twenty-five times the annual tax as a release fee. Only the M√ºllerhof and the Martenshof were able to raise this themselves, the other farms had to continue to pay manorial dues for a long time thereafter. However this did not affect the expansion of the village. The number of inhabitants grew steadily: in 1821 there were 333, in 1890, 580. In 1852 the cemetery around the church, where there were already up to five graves layered one above the other, was closed and a new one laid out north of the village. The Kingdom of Hanover had become a Prussian province in 1866, and M√ºden became part of the district of Celle following the district reforms of 1885. At the same time there began a gradual change in emphasis away from a pure farming village into a summer retreat. Tourism was promoted by the narratives of the writer Hermann L√∂ns and Richard Linde, who also drew other authors like Felicitas Rose and Diedrich Speckmann as well as the painter Fritz Flebbe to M√ºden. Rose and Flebbe are buried in M√ºden. In 1889 the Gasthof zur Post inn was opened, which grew into a busy hotel in the years that followed (today's Posthotel). Another boost for tourism was the opening of the Kleinbahn railway from Celle to Munster on 23 April 1910, with a station at M√ºden, together with the junction to Hanover. In 1913 the electrification of the village began.  Later modern period  For M√ºden the First World War saw the arrival of refugees from East Prussia, the billeting of the 78th Infantry Regiment and the quartering of French and Belgian prisoners-of-war. At the end of the war, M√ºden itself had lost 22 soldiers. In the interwar years, tourism again became important. The number of inhabitants continued to grow and reached 822 in 1928. In 1938 the registered population was 1,162. In 1931 a youth hostel was opened; whose original Bauhaus style was heavily contested. From 1940 the youth hostel had to act as a military hospital. From 1944 the M√ºden population endured frequent air raid alarms, in response to British bombers attacking the nearby airfield at Fa√überg. On 14 April 1945 British troops advanced towards the bridges over the √ñrtze. When a German detachment blew up the bridge over the Wietze in front of them, British tanks that were already in the area opened fire on the village, setting alight and destroying several houses. Not until 1949 was the last damage repaired. As a result of accepting refugees from Germany's eastern territories the number of villagers had grown by 1946 to 1,746. In 1949 new streets were laid out for M√ºden's new citizens. In 1954, a larger cemetery was laid out on the eastern edge of the village. In 1965 the corn mill and sawmill were closed and, in 1993, the buildings were turned into a tourist and cultural centre. In order to improve the attraction of M√ºden, a deer park was established in 1971 and, in 1976, the √ñrtze was partially diverted to create an artificial lake, the Heidesee (Heath Lake). It covers an area of and is used for sailing, angling and walking. With its concentration on tourism, the character of the village had completely changed inside 60 years: in 1995 there were only four agricultural concerns left in the village. Today the place advertises itself as the \\"Pearl of the S√ºdheide\\". In 1973 M√ºden was absorbed into the collective municipality of Fa√überg and, on 1 January 1977 became fully incorporated into the new Fa√überg municipality. The last B√ºrgermeister of M√ºden was G√ºnther H. Wilmsen, who held office from 1973 to 1976.  Economy   Farming  At the beginning of the 11th century the first agricultural farmsteads appeared at the confluence of the Wietze and √ñrtze, such as the M√ºllerhof, the Martenshof and the Renkenhof, which still exist today near the church, albeit fulfilling different roles (inter alia the Hotel Bauernwald). M√ºden had its first chapel in 1185, although it belonged to Hermannsburg. Construction on the Church of St. Lawrence started in 1189 and it was completed in 1217. Not until 1444 was the parish finally separated from Hermannsburg and the village was given its own priest. St. Lawrence Church For the year 1589 we have the first reliable report about the farmsteads in M√ºden thanks to a tax list, the so-called Schatzregister (treasury register). This recorded that, at that time, there were six full and two half farmsteads and five so-called Kotenh√∂fe or cottages. Their owners had 483 sheep, 254 cattle, 92 pigs and 24 horses between them. Almost every farm also had one or more beehives. But the tax record of 1589 says nothing about the farmers' land; the first information about that appears in 1770. By then, there were twelve farms with a total of of land, the M√ºllerhof with owning the largest acreage. The keeping of moorland sheep (Heidschnucken), typical of the region, had expanded in almost 200 years to 1,040 animals. In the years that followed, agriculture continued to be important. In 1867 there were 28 farms, but numbers reached a zenith in 1936 with 98 farms.  Log rafting  In addition to agriculture, log rafting was also carried out on the River √ñrtze until 1912. Trees were felled in the nearby forests; the logs were tied together into rafts and transported downriver via the Aller to Bremen. At its peak in the last quarter of the 19th century almost 2,000 timber rafts were floated downriver each year.  Mills  Former mill in M√ºden, with a turbine house (left) and fish bypass (front) Display board on the working principle of electricity generation using a Francis shaft turbine From the records it is known that there was already a corn mill on the √ñrtze in 1438, which was driven by water power. In 1465 Ole M√ºller, owner of the M√ºllerhof was awarded royal mill rights by the Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Around 1621 a mill was built on the spot where today the mill building dating to 1913 now stands. The mill was in service until 1973. From 1993 to 1997 the building was renovated and, today, it houses the tourist information bureau, a bookshop, a wedding room and exhibition rooms. In an outbuilding there are two Francis shaft turbines for the generation of electricity. One turbine is still in operation and has an output of 7 kW. Until 1959 electricity was generated to operate the grain mill. Today it is primarily used to supply the mill building. The superfluous electricity is fed into the public electricity network. A near-natural fishway has been laid to bypass the weir.  Other trades  From the middle of the 18th century the farms in the village employed many tradesmen, such as coopers, smiths, carpenters and shoemakers, in order to be able to use their services more cheaply than by using craftsmen from outside the village.  Local politics  According to Lower Saxony's municipal regulations, villages that are part of another village's municipality must choose either to elect representatives (Ortsr√§te) on the municipal council or to nominate a local parish council leader (Ortsvorsteher) for the duration of the voting period. The parish of Fa√überg has decided that the villages should elect their own parish council leaders. Since 1977 M√ºden has elected the following leaders: * 1977‚Äì1989 G√ºnther H. Wilmsen * 1989‚Äì2006 master painter Otto Schaper * November 2006 ‚Äì present regular officer Volker Nickel  Sights  Each year, on the second Thursday in July, the moorland sheep (Heidschnucke) auction takes place. The strongest young rams are presented to the breeders and spectators and the best animals win prizes. The Heidschnucke rams can be bid for at the accompanying auction. On the second Sunday in September a mill festival (M√ºhlenfest) is held at the old mill. North of the village there is a natural monument, an ancient oak, known as the Hillige Eeke (holy oak), which is over 600 years old. It was probably used as a Gerichtsbaum, a tree under which regular court sessions were held.

An aerospace specialist, he reported live on the Apollo 11 landing. His newscast from that event was later published on LP by Evolution Records. He also reported on the Apollo 13 crisis as a pool reporter for all three of the major networks at that time, and provided reporting during the launch of the first Space Shuttle, STS-1. His broadcasting career began as a radio actor at KYW, Philadelphia's NBC Red Network affiliate, in 1940, where he appeared on The Lost Continent radio show. His voice was recognized as a potential news voice by a KYW director, who recommended him to radio station WIBG, then based in the Philadelphia suburb of Glenside, Pennsylvania, where he hired on in 1941. He would work as a news director and announcer there until 1943, during which time, he worked on game broadcasts of the Philadelphia Phillies and Philadelphia Athletics. In 1943 he was drafted into the United States Army, where he saw combat action in Europe. After the war ended, he entered the Armed Forces Radio network, where he worked until his 1946 release from the Army. He then returned to WIBG, which had relocated to Philadelphia, but, in early 1947, he went into television at WPTZ, a Philadelphia station that was a predecessor of today's KYW TV, but was at the time owned by the Philco company, and was an early television affiliate of NBC Television. While there, Neal first did an interview show, then went to news coverage. Some of his news coverage was used on an early version of today's network morning shows, while the entertainment was provided by a student of the medium named Ernie Kovacs, whose study of how television worked at that time resulted in a comedy style that was copied by a number of shows, from Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In to Monty Python's Flying Circus. In 1952, both left Philadelphia for the NBC network, with Neal heading up its West Coast news operation. In the 1950s, he appeared in two films: Cry Terror and The Night Holds Terror.

The Forbes Road, an historic military roadway in what was then British America, was initially completed in 1758 from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to the French Fort Duquesne at the junction of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers in what is now downtown Pittsburgh, via Fort Loudon, Fort Littleton, Fort Bedford and Fort Ligonier. The road, initially about 220 miles long, was named for Brigadier General John Forbes, the commander of the 1758 British-led expedition that built the road during the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Year's War). The Forbes Road and Braddock's Road were the two main land routes that the British cut west through the wilderness during the war. The task was complicated by the Appalachian Mountains' steep northeast-to-southwest ridges, a generally broken terrain between the ridges, heavy forestation, and numerous swamps and rivers. Though the physical barriers of Braddock's and Forbes Roads seem quite mundane in comparison to later roads through the mountainous American west, they nevertheless were significant obstacles. Reginald Briggs observes of Forbes' Road, \\"Totalling only the more significant ascents and descents along the road, it was the equivalent of overcoming a single irregular obstacle more than 8,000 feet high, with the net result of only about 170 feet of elevation rise for the 217 miles from Carlisle to Fort Pitt.\\" In many respects, Forbes' Road is a misnomer. Col. James Burd did most of the initial work from Fort Loudon to Raystown (Bedford), Pennsylvania, in preparation for a major supply route southwest to connect with Braddock's Road in 1755. Col. Henry Bouquet improved upon Burd's road in 1758, and extended it to Ligonier, Pennsylvania, where he constructed the last major fortification on the road before the forks of the Ohio. From Ligonier a rough trail was blazed through the Pennsylvania wilderness to the smouldering remnants of Fort Duquesne, with a more substantial, slightly southern route to follow later. Forbes, who suffered severe intestinal illness, directed most of the proceedings from a position well in the rear, though he was on hand to take possession of Fort Duquesne in 1758. History  Controversy  With Braddock's defeat in 1755, construction on Braddock's Road was stopped short less than 10 miles from its goal of Fort Duquesne. To many, particularly from Virginia and the southern colonies, a continuation of Braddock's Road seemed a far more sensible solution than breaking a new path across the largely unknown Pennsylvania wilderness. There was, indeed, uncertainty whether such a northern route was even possible. Braddock's was a slightly longer path to the forks of the Ohio than Forbes' intended route, but had the significant advantage of being mostly completed while Forbes' route was little more than an uncertain footpath. There existed also a political element to the debate: a good deal of business and potential fortune was to fall upon the colony through which post-war traffic would flow. (Colonial boundaries in the west were still unsettled; both Virginia and Pennsylvania claimed the site of future Pittsburgh. There was, additionally, no lost love between the patrician Virginians and the Scots-Irish traders from Pennsylvania on the Ohio frontier.) In the early stages of the war, Virginia had contributed far more capital and soldiers to the war effort than had the parsimonious, Quaker-dominated Pennsylvania assembly, and southern partisans--most notably Col. George Washington-- believed that their commonwealth deserved the greater share of the proceeds. Forbes' route passed through southern Pennsylvania, the most productive farmland in the colonies. Food, wagons, horses, and cattle were in abundant supply -- a claim sparsely-settled Maryland and northern Virginia could not make. While Braddock's Road was essentially a portage path between major watersheds -- the Potomac, Youghiogheny, and Monongahela Rivers -- Forbes' Road would stay to the high ground and encounter no major river crossings, thus avoiding the attendant problems of flooding, deep valleys, and exposure to ambush. Forbes, ably assisted by Bouquet, initially seems to have intended to follow Burd's Road to \\"the Turkeyfoot\\" (Confluence, Pennsylvania), then follow Braddock's Road for the last 80 miles. There was a dawning realization that his army would be marching south for 40 miles, only to march north again in the face of potentially hardened military positions while crossing major flood-prone rivers through some very rugged territory. The direct distance from Fort Bedford to Fort Duquesne was very nearly the same as from Turkeyfoot to Fort Duquesne, but on higher ground, and offered the potential for a surprise attack on the French. And, it is quite possible that the Virginia contingent, particularly the ambitious young Col. Washington, simply pushed their argument beyond the patience of ForbesHulbert traces the correspondence in detail. Pp 81-123.at a moment when the Virginia colony was contracting from its frontier defenses while Pennsylvania was advancing directly into the heart of French territory. Several other elements were also in play: following Braddock's Road could take Forbes' troops past Fort Necessity -- site of Washington's defeat -- and through the killing ground of Braddock's Field, where the picked-over skeletons of the massacred colonial army still lay unburied. Such an experience could not benefit the morale of Forbes' troops. The summer and autumn of 1758 were characterized by endless and extreme rains, so Braddock's Road may well have been impassable had that route been followed. Forbes was also keenly aware of wider strategic concerns unfolding: British colonial advances in the north against French positions, and a potential new treaty with the Natives which would strip the French of their most significant military advantage. Both these latter ventures proved successful for the British colonials. Forbes' deliberate advance won the day; Fort Duquesne, undermanned and out of supplies, was abandoned without a fight. Construction Like General Edward Braddock, Forbes had the daunting task of establishing a road suitable for thousands of troops, supply wagons, and cannon across a largely unbroken wilderness. The initial footpath across south-central Pennsylvania was created by Native Americans, who likely followed game trails. European trappers and traders followed, making modest improvements and rudimentary settlements. As noted above, much of the preliminary work on the military road had been done by Col. James Burd in 1755, who built a road from Fort Loudon to Raystown (now Bedford, Pennsylvania), then southwest towards \\"the Turkey Foot\\" as a supply line to Braddock's army. In contrast to Braddock's ill-fated expedition, Forbes proceeded with great deliberation, constructing forts and redoubts about every 40 miles, with smaller garrisons between. He also ordered the construction of smaller side-paths to parallel the main road when feasible to facilitate passing movements. Swamps were crossed with \\"bridges\\" of logs laid perpendicular to the path. Waterways were forded rather than bridged. Forbes explained in a letter to Pitt, ‚ÄúIt was absolutely necessary, ... that I should take precautions by having posts along my route, which I have done from a project that I took from Turpin‚Äôs Essay, Sur la Guerre. Last chapter 4th Book, Intitled Principe sur lequel on peut √©tablir un projet de Campagne.\\"Hulbert 80. Forbes cites https://archive.org/details/essaisurlartdela00turp/page/n8/mode/2up Forbes' army took possession of the abandoned (and largely destroyed) Fort Duquesne from the French army on November 25, 1758. Forbes then built a much larger fort near the site, naming it Fort Pitt and christening the nascent village of \\"Pittsborough.\\" Construction of the Forbes Road made transportation of supplies, soldiers, messages, and trade easier between the eastern farms and cities and western portions of Pennsylvania, and provided an important route west for settlers for many years after. The road was critical to the success of colonials in Pontiac's War as well as the Revolutionary War. In later years, Forbes' Road provided a more direct route from Philadelphia and the northern cities to the Ohio Country through Pennsylvania in comparison to Braddock's Road, which was constructed west from Cumberland, Maryland, then north into Pennsylvania.\\"It is exceedingly difficult to find a graphic picture of a journey over Braddock‚Äôs Road before 1800; contemporaneous descriptions of a journey over the Cumberland or National Road are not numerous. On the other hand a volume could be filled with descriptions of the old Pennsylvania Road through Bedford and Ligonier. I believe the fame of the Cumberland Road was due rather to the fact of its being a national enterprise‚Äîand the first of its kind on the continent‚Äîthan to any superiority it achieved over competing routes. The idea of the road was grand and it played a mighty part in the advancement of the West; but, such was the nature of its course, that it does not seem to have been the ‚Äúpopular route‚Äù from Washington to Pittsburg, the principal port on the Ohio River. Hulbert 195-196.  Following Forbes' Road  Like many wilderness roads, there were often several generally parallel tracks, a new one carved when an old one became impassable or a better route determined. Consequently, modern efforts to trace the \\"original\\" Forbes Road may be an exercise in frustration; it is often impossible to determine the original track in those rare places when any track can be discerned. Early maps of Forbes Road are of varying utility; some are flatly incorrect. One of the most interesting may be found, with much explanatory text, in \\"The New Way to the Forks of the Ohio: Reflections on John Potts's Map of 1758.\\" While the National Road (US 40) largely follows Braddock's Road across the Appalachian Mountains from Cumberland into Pittsburgh, Forbes' Road through south central Pennsylvania occasionally dissolves into a morass of speculation from Rohr's Gap (on the Allegheny Front west of Schellsburg) to Murrysville, Pennsylvania, with only a few certain locators. In the most general sense, the Pennsylvania Turnpike follows the trend of Forbes's Road west from Carlisle, Pennsylvania to near Monroeville, Pennsylvania just east of Pittsburgh, at places obliterating the historic road. A slightly more accurate rendition of Forbes's Road may be achieved by following US 30 from Chambersburg to the junction of SR 66 west of Greensburg, then north on the latter to US 22 east of Murrysville. US 22 west eventually connects with Penn Avenue, which may be followed to the sites of Fort Duquesne and Fort Pitt. A number of historical markers may be found along this route. A yet closer reconstruction of the earliest road -- subject to correction -- is as follows: The section of Forbes' Road initially cut by Burd in 1755 begins at Fort Loudon, at the foot of Tuscarora Mountain. This early path takes the only significant dog-leg off the generally west-by-northwest trend of the road. Rather directly attacking the escarpment, the Forbes' Road (SR 75) runs north up the Path Valley to Cowans Gap, climbs the alluvial fan, then continues north (CR 404) in a higher valley of the South Branch of Little Augwick Creek. Fort Littleton stands just west of the summit. Forbes Trail Road (CR 431) south of the fort (Off US 522) is probably accurate. The Pennsylvania Turnpike likely obliterated most of the original trail across the valley south of Hustontown, and most regrettably, the switchbacks up Sideling Hill.'As constructed in 1758, the Forbes Road overcame this rise by resorting to a zigzag switchback system of \\"seven reverse curves and two 90-degree turns, with several connecting long tangents --one about a half mile in length-- climbing the long and steep slope. The construction was accomplished by dragging large blocks, in which the mountainside abounds, into a line against which earth was scooped from the mountainside above, the large rocks serving as a retaining wall. A short, steep 'pinch' at the top completed the ascent\\" (Williams, 1975, p. 40). At the top, the road turned generally southwest along the crest, in about 2 1/2 miles reaching the site of Jerry Spring, even recently a reliable source of Forbes Road water for travellers. In 1764, Captain Williams, the Chief Engineer on Bouquet's staff (...), made a considerable improvement in the route up Sideling Hill. \\"By producing a prolongation of the third long tangent of the switchback and taking advantage of an existing natural, inclined shelf rising along the side of the narrow valley of the falling Wooden Bridge Creek, for two miles, then passing through a gap between the lofty King's Knob and the main ridge of Sideling Hill, [Captain] Williams gained the comparatively level top of the connecting ridge to Ray's Hill summit (Williams, 1975, p. 40), joining the route of the 1758 road not far from Jerry Spring.\\"' Briggs 8, citing Williams, E. G., 1975, Bouquet's march to the Ohio: The Forbes Road. Pittsburgh, PA: The Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania, 1975. Of the initial path cut by Burd in 1755, one contemporary account notes \\"'Sideling Hill,' sixty-seven miles west of Carlisle, and thirty miles east of Raystown, 'is cut very artificially, nay more so than We ever saw any; the first waggon that carried a Load up it took fifteen Hundred without ever stopping;'... Hulbert p. 27, citing Pennsylvania Colonial Records, pp. 434, 435. Heading west, US 30 soon parallels the turnpike, and near Breezewood US 30 seems the most likely approximation of Forbes' road. Still heading west, the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River is crossed, and this was followed through two narrow passes (Tussey and Evitts Mountains) to Bedford, Pennsylvania. A slight northward loop bypasses the formidable Wills Mountain. An historical marker indicates the approximate point where Burd's Road of 1755 begins its southwest course toward Confluence, Pennsylvania.Locations of Forbes Road markers The new westward track of Forbes' original route (constructed under the immediate supervision of Bouquet) seems to have also trended south before following low ground through what is now Shawnee State Park. An alternate route carved shortly after by Lt. Col. Sir John St. Clair, Forbes' quartermaster, follows the current US 30 west. Both were reportedly used during the initial march west. The park was the site of the \\"Shawanese Cabins\\" encampment Bouquet used in his 1764 expedition during Pontiac's War. Continuing west on US 30, a turnoff past the Old Log Church parallels Forbes' Road for a short distance. The next significant obstacle is the Allegheny Front, another seemingly endless north‚Äìsouth ridge. In Forbes' era there was doubt whether a break in the mountain sufficient to permit wagon passage existed. After much exploration, Ensign Charles Rohr discovered a north- trending valley which, though quite steep, could be climbed by wagons. US 30 bends sharply through Rohr's Gap; Forbes' Road followed the gap to the top of the ridge where the small redoubt Fort Dewart (aka Duart), the last remaining structure from the original Forbes' Road, guards the summit. A tentative reconstruction of Forbes route and/or later routes suggest proceeding north from Rohr's Gap on Fleegle Road, then west on Lambert Mountain Road/Lambert Street. A slight northward bump in Central City's School Road connects with Monument Road (west). No current road follows Forbes' route over the ridge. A slight detour south on T742, west on Browning, then north on Ridge Road will connect to Old Forbes Road, which may be followed west into Kantner and Stoystown. Several branches of Forbes' Road split as the route proceeds into the rising, rougher ground of Laurel Mountain. Landscape through this region has been substantially altered by strip mining, so there is scant likelihood of finally an original trace; US 30 west parallels Forbes' Road a few miles to the south. A roadside historical marker for Edmund's Swamp indicates the area where good grazing was found for horses and cattle. US 30 (west) is probably the surest route into Jennerstown. What follows is quite speculative: North from Rt 30 in Jennerstown on SR 985 leads to Stemler and Barnick Roads, which on good evidence seem to lie near or on the early Forbes Road. Near the intersection of Barnick with Klines Mills Roads was the Clear Fields encampment named by Bouquet. Klines Mills Road north becomes Sequenota Road, then a rough track to a reservoir. It seems likely that the earliest Forbes' Road ran up the nose of the mountain near this point, crossing the highest elevations of the entire route. Older topographic maps show a jeep trail over the ridge; its current state is unknown to this author. Over the west side of the ridge, Old Forbes picks up again near the intersection with the Laurel Ridge Trail. Several divergent \\"Old Forbes Roads\\" are to be found in this area as there was, indeed, several early iterations. The oldest seems to have trended far to the north. Manpower was needed to construct the fort at Ligonier, so this roundabout route was made to serve until a better track could be cut. The later, closer road (declared \\"four miles shorter and eight miles better\\") was developed as time permitted. As the earliest roads tended to the high ground, a lost trace of this second path across the ridge to Kissell Springs Road seems probable. Kissell Springs intersects with Nature Run Road; north on this latter connects with yet another Old Forbes Road. This trended north and west on Gravel Hill Road, then south down a lost path directly to Fort Ligonier. West of Ligonier, US 30 parallels Loyalhanna Creek through the water gap in Chestnut Ridge -- the last of the major obstacle on the road to Fort Duquesne. Forbes' Road unexpectedly turns south on Four Mile Run, then up and over the 700 foot hill on Youngstown Ridge Road. What occasioned this detour is uncertain. Possibly a fear of ambush through the steep terrain was a concern, or the gap may have been impassable due to heavy rains, mud, and water-bourne detritus. Briggs suggests that a waterlogged gully on Youngstown Ridge may be a remnant of Forbes' Road.Briggs 26 North and west of Youngstown-Latrobe much speculation again prevails on establishing the early track. Following the Youngstown Ridge Road to Arnold Palmer Drive to Clearview seems the most likely path. North on Lloyd Run (SR 981) then left on Monastery Drive to a traffic circle, then north on St. Vincent Drive seems the best approximation of the early track. Then west at Unity Cemetery Road, followed by north at McCullough Road. McCullough becomes Saxman Road, then joins Latrobe Crabtree Road north to Bovard Luxor Road. West on Bovard Luxor, then north again on Cemetery Road, west on Calvary Hill Road (CR 1032), briefly south on New Alexandria (US 119), then west on Old Forbes Road (again, CR 1032), clinging to the ridge tops for a few miles to the site of the \\"three redoubts\\" encampment of 1758. An historical marker at Old Hannastown declares the next two miles \\"certainly along the original Forbes Road.\\" (To the north on Fire Station Road is the village of Forbes Road and Hannastown, probably named for later iterations of the original trace.) Forbes Road (CR1032) continues west until the modern SR 66 interrupts its path. A quick detour south on Forbes Trail Road, then west beneath SR 66 finds Old Rt 66 (and likely the early Forbes Road) heading north until it reaches William Penn Highway (US 22). Modern development has likely obliterated any of the original trail beyond this point. Occasional sections of Old William Penn Highway may follow the early path. As noted above, US 22 eventually meets Penn Avenue, which tracks west to Point Park and the remnants of Forts Duquesne and Pitt. Nearing the point, Penn Avenue passes near Grant Avenue, site of Maj. James Grant's catastrophic attack on the French Fort.  After 1758  A few miles to the south of Export, Pennsylvania (off US 66) lies Bushy Run battlefield, where Col. Bouquet turned the tide on Pontiac's war in 1763. Hulbert closes his volume with some compelling observations about the success and popularity of Forbes' Road in the years between the Revolutionary War and the coming of the railroads: 'Braddock's Road would have been exceedingly roundabout for New England travelers, as Forbes long before clearly established. Pennsylvania's new road, begun in 1785, was not a tempting route of travel for these New Englanders in this year, 1788. ‚ÄúThe roads, at that day,‚Äù wrote Dr. Hildreth, ‚Äúacross the mountains were the worst we can imagine‚Äîcut into deep gullies on one side by mountain rains, while the other was filled with blocks of sand stone.... As few of the emigrant wagons were provided with lock-chains for the wheels, the downward impetus was checked by a large log, or broken tree top, tied with a rope to the back of the wagon and dragged along on the ground. In other places, the road was so sideling that all the men who could be spared were required to pull at the side stays, or short ropes attached to the upper side of the wagons, to prevent their upsetting.... All this part of the country, and as far east as Carlisle, had been, about twenty-five years before, depopulated by the depredations of the Indians. Many of the present inhabitants well remembered those days of trial, and could not see these helpless women and children moving so far away into the wilderness as Ohio, without expressing their fears.... Three days after ... they reached the little village of Bedford. During this period they had crossed ‚ÄúSideling Hill,‚Äù forded some of the main branches of the Juniata, and threaded the narrow valleys along its borders. Every few miles long strings of pack-horses met them on the road, bearing heavy burthens of peltry and ginseng, the two main articles of export from the regions west of the mountains. Others overtook them loaded with kegs of spirits, salt, and bales of dry goods, on their way to the traders in Pittsburg.... .' .... '... Morris Birkbeck, founder of the English settlement in Illinois, journeyed from Washington, D.C., to Pittsburg, in 1817, by way of Frederickstown and Hagerstown and the Pennsylvania Road. At ‚ÄúMcConnell‚Äôs Town,‚Äù under the date of May 23, he wrote in his journal: ‚ÄúThe road we have been travelling [from Washington, D. C.] terminates at this place, where it strikes the great turnpike from Philadelphia to Pittsburg.‚Äù Of the scenes about him Mr. Birkbeck writes: ‚ÄúOld America seems to be breaking up, and moving westward. We are seldom out of sight, as we travel on this grand track, towards the Ohio, of family groups.... To give an idea of the internal movements of this vast hive, about 12,000 wagons passed between Baltimore and Philadelphia, in the last year, with from four to six [horses], carrying from thirty-five to forty cwt. [hundred pounds]. The cost of carriage is about seven dollars per cwt., from Philadelphia to Pittsburg, and the money paid for the conveyance of goods on this road, exceeds ¬£300,000 sterling. Add to these the numerous stages loaded to the utmost, and the innumerable travellers, on horseback, on foot, and in light waggons, and you have before you a scene of bustle and business, extending over a space of three hundred miles, which is truly wonderful.‚Äù Birkbeck does not mention the Cumberland Road, though it is drawn on the map accompanying his book. His advice to prospective immigrants is, in every instance, to come westward by the Pennsylvania [Forbes] Road.'Hulbert 208-212 Markers Historical marker, U.S. 30, Breezewood, PA.

It celebrated the recent victories of the Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War, and proceeds of its sale were to raise funds for Portugal. Background The Vision of Don Roderick is based on an account given by Gin√©s P√©rez de Hita of a legendary consultation of an oracle by the last Visigothic King of Spain, Roderic, around 711: this had been a favourite of Scott's since his boyhood when he had based a four-book poem The Conquest of Granada on it. On 30 April 1811 Scott wrote from Ashiestiel to Lady Abercorn that he had retired to the country to compose a poem in aid of 'the suffering Portuguese', and that James Ballantyne and his brother had generously promised him a hundred guineas (¬£105).The Letters of Sir Walter Scott: 1808‚Äí1811, ed. H. J. C. Grierson (Edinburgh, 1932), 477‚Äí78. A week later he was busy with the composition and planned on completion to send the manuscript to William Erskine for vetting before it was printed.Ibid., 490‚Äí91 (Scott to William Erskine, 9 May 1811). On 12 May he was able to inform James Ballantyne: 'A great deal of the poem is finishd at least in dead colours as the painters say for it wants much touching',Ibid., 492. and the correction was almost complete by the 25th.Ibid., 499 (Scott to Lady Abercorn). Overall, Scott seems to have found the task of composition rather burdensome.Edgar Johnson, Sir Walter Scott: The Great Unknown (London, 1970), 369. Summary Don Roderick, camped outside of Toledo, ponders the outcome of his campaign against the Moors. After confession, he demands that the prelate lead him to a certain sealed chamber, known to be enchanted, which according to legend would reveal the future -- but only to the \\"last\\" King of Spain. When the chamber is opened, the king and prelate find themselves in a vast marble hall, with two giant bronze statues standing on either side. The left-hand giant carries a scythe and an hourglass, and the right-hand giant carries a mace. The hourglass runs out almost immediately after their entrance, and the other giant turns and demolishes the far wall with his mace, revealing a magic panorama. The panorama depicts various phases in the future of Spain: first, the conquest by the Moors; second, the Spanish Inquisition; third, the conquest by Napoleon I of France, and the arrival of British forces to liberate the country. Such sweep fits with Scott's political agenda. Editions The Vision of Don Roderick was published on 2 July 1811 in Edinburgh by John Ballantyne and Co., and later in the month in London by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown.

Francis Jeffrey in The Edinburgh Review is typical with his verdict that Scott 'has fewer new images than in his other poetry,‚Äîhis tone is less natural and varied,‚Äîand he moves, upon the whole, with a slower and more laborious pace'.The Edinburgh Review, 18 (August 1811), 379‚Äí92 (383). The general conception of the poem was regarded as unfortunate, though there was some praise for Scott's aim to produce an elevated national work.

After about 40 minutes, Flight 231 was on approach to the airport, planning to land on runway 21R. It entered an area of rain, which turned out to be a severe thunderstorm, at 1500 feet. About a minute after entering the storm, a downdraft struck the plane, which caused the nose to go up and the plane to stall. The aircraft then went into a nose dive, which the pilot tried to pull the aircraft out of. The Hawker then banked slightly to the right, and was almost out of the dive when it crashed into the ground. The plane then slid for 510 feet and broke up at 06:55.

Career He left Saint-Cyr, and was a trooper in the guard who followed Louis XVIII to Ghent. He was a Cuirassiers officer in the Royal Guard under the Restoration, he resigned on 26 July 1830. He rallied to Louis Philippe, and entered the House of Peers in 1832, where he sat with the right, supporters of conservative politics. After the presidential election of 1848, he became a fervent supporter of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte. He had no official business when, on 26 October 1851, he was appointed foreign minister in the cabinet containing St. Arnaud and Maupas, charged with preparing a coup. Without doubt the Marquis de Turgot owed this amazing promotion to his name, as much as his social position. Although not required, apparently he confided in the coup, and he fully supported, as a man of order, the new regime, that was responsible for admission by the European embassies. On 28 July 1852, he was replaced by Drouyn Lhuys, and was appointed senator. In April 1853, he obtained the post of ambassador in Madrid. During his mission, he fought a duel with his U.S. counterpart, in which he was seriously injured. Recovered, he became ambassador in August 1858 in Bern, where he remained for eight years until his death. Turgot had said: ‚ÄúColonies are like fruits which cling to the tree only till they ripen.‚Äù He had predicted that as soon as America can take care of herself, she would break away from Britain.http://selfstudyhistory.com/2016/01/19/history-optional- paper-2-solution-2006-q-5-b/ References Category:1796 births Category:1866 deaths Category:French Foreign Ministers Category:People from Falaise, Calvados ","title":"Louis F√©lix √âtienne, marquis de Turgot"},{"id":"26110522","text":"Carolyn Haines (born May 12, 1953 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi), who uses the pseudonyms R.B.

Dockrell is right-handed batsman and slow left-arm orthodox bowler who plays international cricket for Ireland after learning his cricket at Leinster Cricket Club, Dublin. He was a member of the class of 2010 in Gonzaga College, Dublin. In December 2018, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract by Cricket Ireland for the 2019 season. In January 2020, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract from Cricket Ireland, the first year in which all contracts were awarded on a full-time basis. Early career Dockrell has represented Ireland from U-13 level upwards. In 2009, Dockrell was part of the 2010 U-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier winning squad. Victory in this tournament allowed Ireland to take part in the 2010 U-19 Cricket World Cup, where Dockrell made his Youth One Day International debut against South Africa U-19s. Dockrell played a further three Youth One Day Internationals in the tournament. Dockrell made his debut for Ireland A in 2008. The same year he was invited to coaching sessions with Somerset County Cricket Club. Domestic and T20 career Somerset County Cricket Club were interested in Dockrell since he was 15. On 18 July 2010 it was announced that Somerset had offered Dockrell a two-year contract. Speaking of his aims, Dockrell said \\"My ambitions are to keep making progress with Ireland, but also to get into a county first team by developing all aspects of my game\\". Commitment to Ireland's internationals in the Intercontinental Cup limited Dockrell's availability for Somerset towards the end of the 2010 season. He was selected in Ireland's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup. During the tournament Dockrell suffered a dislocated shoulder. The rehabilitation period meant he missed much of his first season with Somerset. He featured in a single County Championship match, although his appearances in limited overs games were more frequent, playing in the semi-final of the twenty20 cup and the Champions Trophy. A side made up of some of the best players from Associate and Affiliate teams was put together to face England in Dubai in January 2012. The three-day match was part of England's preparation for a series against Pakistan later that month. Dockrell was one of four Ireland players included in the 12-man squad. Fellow left-arm spinner Murali Kartik left Somerset at the end of the season, giving Dockrell the opportunity to establish himself in the team. In Somerset's opening match of the 2012 County Championship Dockrell took 6/27 in the second innings against Middlesex to help his side to a six-wicket victory. At the end of the 2015 season, Dockrell was released by Somerset. Dockrell was the leading run-scorer and wicket-taker in the 2018 Inter-Provincial Cup, scoring 231 runs and taking ten wickets in the tournament. In November 2018, he was named the Men‚Äôs Inter-Provincial Player of the Year at the annual Cricket Ireland Awards. In July 2019, he was selected to play for the Dublin Chiefs in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, the following month the tournament was cancelled. International career By early in 2010, Ireland had lost their two most experienced spinners, Kyle McCallan and Regan West, to retirement and injury respectively. For the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier and the 2010 Quadrangular Twenty20 Series in Sri Lanka, young spinners Dockrell and Gary Kidd were chosen. Dockrell made his debut for the senior Ireland team in the 2010 Quadrangular Twenty20 Series in Sri Lanka. Dockrell's debut Twenty20 match against Afghanistan was also his debut Twenty20 International. Dockrell took figures of 2/11 in the match as Ireland won by 5 wickets. Dockrell's second Twenty20 match came against Sri Lanka A, where he claimed a single wicket. After Impressing in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, Dockrell was selected in the Ireland squad for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, playing a starring role as the tournament's youngest player, taking four wickets against the West Indies and troubling Kevin Pietersen in a tight bowling display in the abandoned encounter with England. Dockrell reflected that \\"Taking three wickets against West Indies gave me a huge boost in confidence. I was very nervous before that game, but by the time we came to play England I was a lot calmer. I was really happy with how the tournament went for me overall\\". He was forced to miss Ireland's ODI encounter with Australia on 17 June 2010 because he was sitting a Biology exam in the Leaving Certificate. Australia hosted the 2012 Under-19 World Cup in August and Dockrell was named captain for the tournament. In January 2019, he was named in Ireland's squad for their one-off Test against Afghanistan in India. He made his Test debut for Ireland against Afghanistan on 15 March 2019. In September 2019, he was named in Ireland's squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates. On 10 July 2020, Dockrell was named in Ireland's 21-man squad to travel to England to start training behind closed doors for the ODI series against the England cricket team.

In this theory, B is chosen to be a so-called (E, G)-regular ring, i.e. an E-algebra with an E-linear action of G satisfying certain conditions given below. This theory is most prominently used in p-adic Hodge theory to define important subcategories of p-adic Galois representations of the absolute Galois group of local and global fields. (E, G)-rings and the functor D Let G be a group and E a field. Let Rep(G) denote a non-trivial strictly full subcategory of the Tannakian category of E-linear representations of G on finite-dimensional vector spaces over E stable under subobjects, quotient objects, direct sums, tensor products, and duals.Of course, the entire category of representations can be taken, but this generality allows, for example if G and E have topologies, to only consider continuous representations. An (E, G)-ring is a commutative ring B that is an E-algebra with an E-linear action of G. Let F = BG be the G-invariants of B. The covariant functor DB : Rep(G) ‚Üí ModF defined by :D_B(V):=(B\\\\otimes_EV)^G is E-linear (ModF denotes the category of F-modules). The inclusion of DB(V) in B ‚äóEV induces a homomorphism :\\\\alpha_{B,V}:B\\\\otimes_FD_B(V)\\\\longrightarrow B\\\\otimes_EV called the comparison morphism.A contravariant formalism can also be defined. In this case, the functor used is D_B^\\\\ast(V):=\\\\mathrm{Hom}_G(V,B), the G-invariant linear homomorphisms from V to B. Regular (E, G)-rings and B-admissible representations An (E, G)-ring B is called regular if #B is reduced; #for every V in Rep(G), Œ±B,V is injective; #every b ‚àà B for which the line bE is G-stable is invertible in B. The third condition implies F is a field. If B is a field, it is automatically regular. When B is regular, :\\\\dim_FD_B(V)\\\\leq\\\\dim_EV with equality if, and only if, Œ±B,V is an isomorphism. A representation V ‚àà Rep(G) is called B-admissible if Œ±B,V is an isomorphism. The full subcategory of B-admissible representations, denoted RepB(G), is Tannakian. If B has extra structure, such as a filtration or an E-linear endomorphism, then DB(V) inherits this structure and the functor DB can be viewed as taking values in the corresponding category. Examples *Let K be a field of characteristic p (a prime), and Ks a separable closure of K. If E = Fp (the finite field with p elements) and G = Gal(Ks/K) (the absolute Galois group of K), then B = Ks is a regular (E, G)-ring. On Ks there is an injective Frobenius endomorphism œÉ : Ks ‚Üí Ks sending x to xp. Given a representation G ‚Üí GL(V) for some finite- dimensional Fp-vector space V, D=D_{K_s}(V) is a finite-dimensional vector space over F=(Ks)G = K which inherits from B = Ks an injective function œÜD : D ‚Üí D which is œÉ-semilinear (i.e. œÜ(ad) = œÉ(a)œÜ(d) for all a ‚àà K and all d ‚àà D). The Ks-admissible representations are the continuous ones (where G has the Krull topology and V has the discrete topology). In fact, D_{K_s} is an equivalence of categories between the Ks-admissible representations (i.e. continuous ones) and the finite-dimensional vector spaces over K equipped with an injective œÉ-semilinear œÜ. Potentially B-admissible representations A potentially B-admissible representation captures the idea of a representation that becomes B-admissible when restricted to some subgroup of G.

Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa commanded Madero's army, which besieged Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua. After two days of fighting the city's garrison surrendered and Orozco and Villa took control of the town. The fall of Ciudad Ju√°rez to Madero, combined with Emiliano Zapata's taking of Cuautla in Morelos, convinced D√≠az that he could not hope to defeat the rebels. As a result, he agreed to the Treaty of Ciudad Ju√°rez, resigned and went into exile in France, thus ending the initial stage of the Mexican Revolution.McLynn, pg. 98 Background Diaz's 34-year dictatorial rule met with much opposition, which finally coalesced around the leadership of Francisco Madero. Madero had escaped from prison and, while in exile in the US in November 1910, called for an uprising against D√≠az. In the northern state of Chihuahua the call was answered by trader, miner and arms smuggler Pascual Orozco and the \\"social bandit\\" Pancho Villa, both of whom began guerrilla operations against D√≠az's troops.McLynn, pg. 63 Madero at the head of his forces in 1910. Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, as well as the outbreak of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Ju√°rez. If they could take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very well be the final push that would knock over the Porfiriato.McLynn, pg. 85 At the same time the attack on the city would mark the first time that the revolutionary army would confront federal forces in a regular battle rather than relying on guerrilla tactics.Katz, pg. 103 While the fusion of Madero's, Villa's and Orozco's men did result in a number of troops sufficient to form a force capable of fighting professional soldiers in pitched encounters, the federal troops still had the advantage in terms of training and discipline. The government, in fact, had a good chance of squashing the rebels by moving troops down from the state capital of Ciudad Chihuahua and capturing Madero in a pincer movement. However, the D√≠az- appointed governor of the state, Miguel Ahumada,Katz, pg. 86 was worried that if the soldiers abandoned the capital unrest would break out and the insurrection would spread. As a further sign of the apparent demoralization of federal rank-and-file soldiers (many of whom had been forcibly conscripted and actually sympathized with the revolutionaries), the troops in Ciudad Chihuahua decided to stay put.Katz, pg. 104 The battle Revolutionary camp outside Ciudad Ju√°rez in 1911. Run-up engagements Madero sent some of his forces to make a diversionary attack on Agua Prieta, which proved successful; the resulting First Battle of Agua Prieta was significant in that it was the first time railroads were used by the rebels to gain surprise and that US forces were involved in the fighting. The town was recaptured by federal troops two weeks later once additional reinforcements arrived. The main rebel offensive occurred on April 7, when Madero led 1,500 men to Ciudad Ju√°rez, preceded by Villa and Orozco with 500 men each. Along the way the insurrectionists captured Temosachi and Bauche, which greatly raised their morale.Katz, pg. 104 Ciudad Ju√°rez, defended by 700 troops, was surrounded on three sides, with the only possible exit route for the besieged federales being the northern path into El Paso and the US.McLynn, pg. 86 Despite the fact that the revolutionaries had cut off the water supplies into town and the garrison was low on ammunition, its commander, Gen. Juan N. Navarro, refused to surrender, convinced that the inexperience of the rebels in laying sieges would allow him to hold out. Four U.S soldiers watching the Battle of Ciudad Ju√°rez in 1911. Villa and Orozco disobey Madero At this point D√≠az tried to come to terms with Madero, particularly after the capture of Cuautla by the Zapatistas in south-central Mexico. Together with his finance minister and main advisor, Jos√© Yves Limantour, D√≠az planned to make concessions to the fairly moderate Madero and, once Madero was pacified, crack down hard on the more radical elements among the rebels.McLynn, pg. 87 A truce was agreed to on April 23.De La Pedraja Tom√°n, pg. 147 While Madero was ready to negotiate with D√≠az and hold off from attacking, Villa and Orozco would have none of it. On May 8De La Pedraja Tom√°n, pg. 150 the two generals launched an assault on the city without consulting Madero and blamed it on a \\"spontaneous\\" outbreak in fighting. The incident that served as an excuse for the offensive occurred when a federal officer insulted a female rebel on a bridge between Ciudad Ju√°rez and El Paso. Madero attempted to halt the violence but Orozco and Villa pressed on. Both of them went to great lengths to avoid Madero so they wouldn't have to disobey a direct order. Even when Villa was eventually confronted by Castulo Herrera with explicit instructions to stop fighting, he simply ignored him. Likewise, when Madero finally managed to see Orozco in person, he was simply told that the battle was already raging and it was too late to stop it.McLynn, pg. 95 Street fighting in Ciudad Ju√°rez Navarro, for his part, pressured by Madero, tried to keep the ceasefire for as long as he could. This proved to be quite costly to the defenders. The rebel forces captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.De La Pedraja Tom√°n, pg. 151 Orozco attacked in the north and Villa in the south. Both of them led their troops parallel to the US border so that neither their shots, nor those of the town's garrison were likely to cross on to the American side.Katz, pg. 104 In fact, several thousand American civilians had gathered in El Paso in order to watch the struggle as spectators. Unconventional attack Giuseppe Garibaldi II, in Mexico in 1911, fought at the battle on the side of the revolutionaries. The rebels took control of the bridges connecting the city to the US, cut off electricity and telegraph, captured the bullring and reached the outskirts of the city center (where the second line of defenses had been constructed) on the first day of fighting. Navarro, influenced by the advice of the impetuous Col. Tamborrel, turned down an offer of safe passage made by the rebels. The town was well defended and fortified, as Navarro had prepared a defense in depth with several concentric rings of trenches, barricades and fortifications. However, unknown to the defenders, the insurrectionists had with them significant supplies of dynamite and foreign experts from other guerrilla wars, including Boer Gen. Ben Viljoen and the grandson of the famous Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi II (news dispatches from the battle also mention the participation of the future star of many Hollywood Westerns, Tom Mix). In order to counteract the formidable defenses, the rebels developed an effective strategy that managed to circumvent Navarro's well-placed machine-gun nests and street barricades. Rather than attacking through the streets, the rebels used the dynamite to blow the walls of the adobe houses that were huddled up next to each other, which allowed them to proceed through the city house by house. Another novel aspect of the offensive used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, then go back to secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant. The city's defenders ran out of water on May 8 (according to a report later submitted by Madero himself) and were confined to only a few buildings in the center of the city. Most of the fighting at this point was at close quarters; as a result, the advantage in machine guns and artillery that the federals enjoyed earlier was no longer a factor. According to some accounts, Gen. Navarro's troops were on the verge of mutiny and he was worried that they would turn on his officers. To forestall that possibility, Navarro began negotiations with the rebel forces.De La Pedraja Tom√°n, pg. 152 He surrendered the town two days later, at 2:30 p.m. on May 10, 1911.Katz, pg. 111 Aftermath Madero is seated in the center, Orozco on the far right and Villa is standing on the far left. After capturing the town, Madero and his revolutionary movement achieved a new kind of credibility, both within Mexico and in the US. Some American journalists crossed the border in order to congratulate Madero personally, and reported back to American readers on the quick and efficient way that order within the city had been reestablished. Fall of D√≠az The outcome of the battle changed the perception of the rebel movement in Mexico. Before Madero's victory many believed that the rebel forces would scatter as soon as they were confronted by federal troops. The fall of Ju√°rez proved that notion wrong and revealed the real strength of the rebel forces.De La Pedraja Tom√°n, pg. 154 The immediate effect of the rebels' success helped convince Porfirio D√≠az to agree to the revolutionaries' demand for his resignation. Prompted by Limantour, two days after the end of the battle D√≠az signed the Treaty of Ciudad Ju√°rez with Madero, and ten days after the battle he resigned and went into exile in France.Katz, pg. 116 This ended the first stage of the Mexican Revolution, and at the same time made it clear that even well-garrisoned troops were not invulnerable to guerrilla armies.McLynn, pg. 100 Pascual Orozco, one of the victorious rebel generals at Ciudad Ju√°rez. Orozco felt that he should be the head of the revolution. Dissension among the victors A more indirect consequence arose from the disagreements that occurred between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began during the battle and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the fighting was still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over payments to their soldiers and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian who had joined the revolution at the last minute, and for these reasons was despised by Orozco. However, the immediate cause for the outbreak of the conflict among the rebels was the fate of federal Gen. Juan N. Navarro who had defended Ciudad Ju√°rez. Both Villa and Orozco wanted him executed for his earlier killing of rebel prisoners taken by his forces.De La Pedraja Tom√°n, pg. 153 Madero opposed it, despite the fact that a court-martial of federal officers who committed war crimes was one of the main points of his manifesto. Orozco and Villa went to confront Madero, a tense situation arose and (according to Villa and other witnesses) Orozco drew his pistol on Madero. Eventually Madero escaped the predicament by appealing directly to Villa's and Orozco's troops and the two generals had to relent. Madero escorted Navarro personally across the US border to El Paso. Likewise, Carranza kept his post while Orozco in particular nursed a grudge. However, Madero did withdraw gold from the local bank and distributed it to the troops in accordance with the generals' wishes.Katz, pg. 112Katz, 113 The motivations of the three in the infighting are not completely clear. According to Friedrich Katz, Madero, in refusing to let Navarro be killed, was motivated not only by his personal humanism but also by a need to assert his civilian authority over military leaders. It also seems that Villa was mostly concerned with taking care of his soldiers and his personal hatred for Navarro, since it was his soldiers‚Äîknown as Villistas‚Äîwho Navarro had earlier ordered to be bayoneted. Years later, after he fell out with Orozco, Villa wrote in his memoirs that the whole episode was a set-up by Orozco, who had been paid 50,000 pesos by D√≠az's agents to get him to kill Madero. While Katz and other scholars consider this assessment extreme, it is possible that Orozco, who believed he should be the rightful leader of the revolution, was trying to provoke Villa into killing Madero. That way Madero would be out of the way, Villa would be discredited among the intellectual revolutionary circles as a common bandit and Orozco could claim the mantle of leadership. In the end, however, Villa kept his cool, Madero convinced common soldiers to support him and Orozco did not have the nerve to go through with it.Katz, pg. 112-114 Later developments resulting from the battle Orozco remained unsatisfied with the political positions he was offered in the Madero government. He became even more angry when Madero asked him to fight Zapata in central Mexico. As a result, in March 1912--less than a year after the battle of Ciudad Ju√°rez--Orozco formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero.McLynn, pg. 131 He subsequently supported Victoriano Huerta in his coup d'√©tat against Madero. After Huerta's fall Orozco went into exile in the US and was eventually killed by Texas Rangers while trying to make his way back into Mexico to start another revolt.McLynn, pg. 309 Villa remained loyal to Madero (and even fought for him against Orozco)McLynn, pg. 135 and contributed greatly to the fall of Huerta.McLynn, pgs. 170-172 However, he broke with CarranzaMcLynn, pgs. 231-233 and lost the struggle for the control of the revolution to Carranza's Gen. √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n.McLynn, pgs. 298-301 References ;Notes ;Bibliography *Frank McLynn, Villa and Zapata, Basic Books, 2000. . . *Friedrich Katz, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, Stanford University Press, 1998. . . *Ren√© De La Pedraja Tom√°n, Wars of Latin America, 1899-1941, McFarland, 2006. . * Ciudad Juarez Category:1911 in Mexico Category:1911 in Texas Category:Ciudad Ju√°rez Ciudad Juarez Category:April 1911 events Category:May 1911 events ","title":"Battle of Ciudad Ju√°rez (1911)"},{"id":"26110736","text":"is a railway station in the town of Izumozaki, Sant≈ç District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East).

It is co- located with Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes, which is owned and operated by Avinor. As an air station, the aerodrome is primarily used for the Marine Corps Preposition Program Norway, which involves the United States armed forces stationing equipment at V√¶rnes and other facilities in the Trondheim region of central Norway. The V√¶rnes military installations contain place for up to six aircraft of the size of a C-5 Galaxy and barracks to house 1,200 soldiers. It also serves the Home Guard, including its training center and the headquarters of the Tr√∏ndelag District (HV-12). Formerly, the air force's pilot school was located at V√¶rnes. Facilities A United States Air Force C-5 Galaxy unloading cargo at V√¶rnes Air Station V√¶rnes Air Station is the one of two air stations in Central Norway, the other being √òrland Main Air Station. There are no aircraft permanently stationed at V√¶rnes, but the station serves the Home Guard, including its training center and the headquarters of the Tr√∏ndelag District (HV-12). Most of the military installations are located on the north side of the runway, although some are also located on the south side, to the east of the civilian terminal. V√¶rnes also serves as a storage base for the United States armed forces as part of the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program- Norway. The military owns the runways and taxiways, but these are operated by Avinor. Three to four hundred military aircraft are handled at the air station each year. The military installations contain place for up to six aircraft of the size of a C-5 Galaxy and barracks to house 1,200 soldiers. The Ring Road connects the northern to the southern installations and passes past the main runway on the east side.Avinor (2006): 8‚Äì10 The main runway is long, and runs east‚Äìwest at 09/27. It is wide, plus shoulders of on each side. The runway is equipped with instrument landing system category 1. The main radar, a combined primary and secondary, is placed at Vennafjell, south of the airport. Other radars are located at Kopparen, Tronfjell and Gr√•kallen.Avinor (2006): 19‚Äì21 The taxiway runs the parallel the full length of the main runway. It is wide, with wide shoulders on each side. The center-distance between the runway and taxiway is , allowing simultaneous use by code E aircraft (such as a Boeing 747).Avinor (2006): 22 V√¶rnes has a theoretical capacity of 40 air movements per hour, with a registered capacity of 25.Avinor (2006): 24 The airport also has a diagonal runway, which runs 14/32, roughly northwest‚Äìsoutheast. It is long, plus end section of on Runway 14 and on Runway 32. The runway is closed for traffic, in part because of bad asphalt quality.Avinor (2006): 20 History V√¶rnes in 1936 V√¶rnes is first recorded in the 10th century as the seat for one of eight chieftains of Tr√∏ndelag. The first military activity in the area was as a base for leidang. After the Viking Age, the farm at V√¶rnes was taken over by the king and became the seat of the vogt. From 1671, the farm was owned by a series of military officers and public servants. In 1887, the farm was bought by the Royal Norwegian Army and converted to a camp.Hovd (2000): 17‚Äì22 The first aircraft to use V√¶rnes was a military Farman MF.7 Longhorn, which took off on 26 March 1914. It was part of the plan to establish the Norwegian Army Air Service, for which V√¶rnes was chosen as the initial station for Central Norway. Radio equipment was installed in 1919 and the first hangar was built in 1920. By 1922 the grass field serving as runway has become insufficient for newer planes, both in terms of length and level, but this was not performed until 1925. In 1927, parliament passed legislation to move the division to Rinnleiret from 1930, but this was later annulled. With the delivery of Fokker aircraft in 1930, the runway was again upgraded and extended.Hovd (2000): 80‚Äì90 V√¶rnes in 1936 V√¶rnes was surrendered to Luftwaffe on 9 April 1940, during the German occupation of Norway. On 24 April, 350 civilians started construction at V√¶rnes, and within a few days 2,000 people were hired. On 28 April, a new wooden runway was completed. The expansion was part of the plans for Festung Norwegen and was used as a bomber base for attacks on Northern Norway, and by May there were 200 aircraft stationed at V√¶rnes. During the war, particularly in April 1940, the airport was subject to several bombings from the Royal Air Force. In June, work was started to clear the forests near the airport, and graves from the Viking Age were found. Construction was halted for several weeks while German and Norwegian archaeologists conducted research. In July, work started on building concrete runways, and by 1942 all three runways were finished. The east‚Äìwest was made long, the north‚Äìsouth was made while the northwest‚Äìsoutheast was made long. A number of taxiways were also constructed. A branch line of the railway was built to the hangars. By 1945, Luftwaffe had built about 100 buildings at V√¶rnes. The land expropriated was estimated at between .Hovd (2000): 116‚Äì126 The Germans had also finished the control tower that had been under construction in 1940.Hovd (2000): 301 Erhard Milch visits Luftwaffe troops on 23 April 1940 After the war ended, the airport was initial taken over by the Royal Air Force, but they soon withdrew leaving the Norwegian military in charge. After the war, former S.O.E and later main battle unit RAF 138 Squadron was posted as attached to 130 wing to Vaernes between 27-August-1945 and 7-October-1945. Numerous squadrons, including 332, 331 and 337 were stationed at V√¶rnes in the post-war years. In 1952 the pilot school was moved to V√¶rnes, but in 1954 √òrland Main Air Station became the main air force base in Central Norway, and the majority of the armed air forces (with the exception of the school) moved to √òrland.Hovd (2000): 133‚Äì172 After World War II, there was only general aviation at V√¶rnes, organized by V√¶rnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take- offs from V√¶rnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport was used as a pasture for sheep. The first scheduled service was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL during the winter of 1947‚Äì48. While there were many customers initially, the lack of sufficient de- icing caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season. The route was not reopened the following year.Hovd (2000): 308‚Äì309 The air traffic control at V√¶rnes was established in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The Telecommunications Administration took over the responsibility for the radio installations, and the responsibility for the meteorological services became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on to the control tower, giving a much better view of the airfield.Hovd (2000): 299‚Äì303 Prior to World War II, Heimdal south of Trondheim had been proposed as a location for the primary airport for Trondheim. Construction had started with drainage and ground works, but this work was interrupted by the war. Because of the large investments made in V√¶rnes by Luftwaffe, a commission was established in 1947 to look into if V√¶rnes or Lade instead should be selected. The commission was unanimous in recommending V√¶rnes, highlighting that the airport was of a sufficient size to handle all civilian and military needs in the foreseeable future, and emphasized the proximity to the railway and highway. However, the commission recommended that Heimdal and Lade be kept as possibilities for future expansion. When the issue was discussed in parliament, several members of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications complained about the long distance to Trondheim, but the low investment needs (stipulated to NOK 1.3 million for necessary navigation and air control investments) convinced parliament, who passed legislation in favor of V√¶rnes on 10 June 1952.Hovd (2000): 172‚Äì173 In 1956, NATO approved the plans for V√¶rnes to be financed through its infrastructure investment plan, after rejecting proposals for Heimdal. The costs were estimated at NOK 27.4 million and would allow the runway to be extended to support jet aircraft. Such an extension had already been done at √òrland Main Air Station, but NATO wanted to have two military air station of such dimensions in Central Norway. The east‚Äìwest runway was to be extended to ; initial proposals had called for the extension to occur on the east side, but the Ministry of Defence instead wanted the expansion of the fjord side to reduce expropriation costs. This called for a complex civil engineering program, as the railway and highway would have to pass under the runway in tunnels and an artificial island would have to be built in the fjord.Hovd (2000): 173 In 1957, parliament started a new process to consider Heimdal as the primary airport, in part because the airlines and the Civil Aviation Administration stated that they felt V√¶rnes was insufficient. However, higher costs‚Äîdue to bad ground conditions and existing infrastructure at V√¶rnes, valuated at NOK 150 million‚Äîcaused parliament to support V√¶rnes. Construction commenced in January 1959, with the work subcontracted to Selmer. First the artificial peninsula was built, then the delta of the Stj√∏rdal River was moved, before a tunnel was built around the highway and railway. Finally, the runway could be built on top, and construction completed on 21 October 1961.Hovd (2000): 176‚Äì177 In 1963, the airport had 115,000 passengers, increasing to 195,000 the following year. That year, SAS started using the Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft on their route.Hovd (2000): 310 Civilian Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes is an international airport which shares runways, taxiways, air control and other joint functions with V√¶rnes Air Station. Operated by the state-owned Avinor. In 2009, the airport had 3,424,965 passengers and 54,686 air movements, making it the fourth-busiest in the country. The airport has two terminals; A dates from 1994 and is used for domestic traffic, while B is the renovated former main terminal from 1982, and is used for international traffic. The airport features an integrated train station and an airport hotel. The main airlines at the airport are Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Norwegian Air Shuttle and Wider√∏e, all who have V√¶rnes as a focus city. The main route is the service to Oslo, operated by both SAS and Norwegian, which is the tenth-busiest route in Europe. Both airlines operate services using Boeing 737 aircraft to Bergen, Bod√∏ and Troms√∏; SAS has some additional domestic services while Norwegian has a number of low-frequency international services. Wider√∏e operates regional Dash 8 aircraft to six airports in Helgeland, in addition to their hub in Sandefjord and SAS' hub in Copenhagen. Daily international services to Amsterdam is provided by KLM and to √ñstersund and Stockholm by Nextjet; Icelandair will commence services to their hub at Reykjav√≠k from June 2010. The airport also serves charter services, mainly to the Mediterranean.

They ranged from improvements for artillery to navigation and steering devices. After retiring from the Navy, Kennish worked as a schoolteacher on the Isle of Man. But in 1849, he immigrated to the United States for more opportunities. He began surveying gold lands in Colombia, South America, for firms based in New York City. In 1855 he completed a report on a potential river aqueduct or canal across the northwest isthmus of present-day Colombia, using the Atrato River and emptying into Bahia Humboldt, Choc√≥ and the Pacific Ocean. That year Congress approved a joint military expedition of a US Navy and Army party to explore this, and Kennish acted as their guide. He later died in New York. Life Kennish was born in the Parish of Maughold, on the Isle of Man, in a cottage at Cornaa on the Douglas-Ramsey Road. His parents were farmers, and he learned farming from his father. He grew up speaking Manx as his first language. He knew very little English until after he became a seaman in the Royal Navy at the age of 22. He learned English and rose to the rank of Master Carpenter by the time he was 27. In October 1826, he married Mary Byford, of Gillingham, Chatham, Kent, England.[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/worthies/p118.htm A. W. Moore, Chap. 6: Manx Worthies or Biographies of Notable Manx Men and Women, pp. 188-121, Douglas, Isle of Man: S.K. Broadbent & Co., 1901 Between 1827 and 1832, while in the service of the Royal Navy, he invented a system (\\"A Method for Concentrating the Fire of a Broadside\\") for improving the aiming of naval artillery. Other inventions included a fuze for a shell, and a system for floating naval artillery to shore for land use. He invented a marine theodolite, which was a key element of his improved method. He proposed the practice of painting naval vessels grey to reduce the distortion and decay caused by solar radiation on black-painted timbers. He also worked on creating an artificial horizon for navigation; a[n] automatic depth-sounding instrument; a method of drowning the magazine of a ship of war; an hydraulic ventilator; [and] a hydrostatic diving machine[.] When the Royal Navy became interested in steam propulsion, between 1832 and 1840, Kennish designed several steam engines and an early screw propeller; but the Royal Navy did not take up his ideas. Disenchanted, he retired from the Royal Navy in November 1841. He worked for the Civilian Architect's Office at Woolwich Dockyard, London, until March 1844, when he and his family departed to settle on the Isle of Man. After leaving the Royal Navy and his scientific pursuits, Kennish began writing poetry about 1840. His collection of poems, Mona's Isle and Other Poems, was published in 1844 in London, and was promoted in newspapers on the Isle of Man. In 1845 Kennish was hired as a parochial school master in Ballasalla but was not successful. In debt, he was imprisoned for debt for a brief time that year in Castle Rushen, Isle of Man. Shortly after this the debt was resolved, and Kennish was hired by the Royal Navy to conduct surveys of the coastline of the Isle of Man. Also about this time, he invented a pneumatic tube system to convey messages and suggested its use to the Admiralty. They did not adopt it but it was later used by the General Post Office in London. He promoted the idea after immigrating to the United States, and it became widely used there in the years after his death.William Kennish. Immigration to the USA In 1849, Kennish immigrated to the United States for more opportunities. He soon began surveying gold-bearing land in Choc√≥ Department, Colombia, in South America. In 1855 he planned a route for an inter-oceanic river aqueduct across the northwest isthmus in this province, for the Hope Association of New York. His report on his survey of this proposed canal route was included in The Practicality and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, published in 1855 by George F. Nesbitt & Co. of New York.Title Page of The Practicality and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. According to his papers, Kennish proposed to use part of the Atrato River (which flows north into the Atlantic), and possibly its tributary Rio Truando, to create a river aqueduct and inter-oceanic route across the isthmus of northwest present-day Colombia, through Nerqua Pass and the valley of the Nerqua, to empty into Bah√≠a Humboldt on the Pacific Ocean side. That year the US Congress approved a joint US Navy-Army military expedition to explore Kennish's proposed route in Choc√≥ Department, Colombia. He was chosen as guide for the expedition. Kennish died in New York City in 1862. Colombia, which then controlled all of the isthmus, rejected an offer from the US in the 19th century to build a canal across it. No further United States action was taken on a canal until after Panama revolted against Colombia and became independent in 1903. The Panamanians \\"negotiated a treaty with the United States that created a Canal Zone 10 miles (16 km) wide under U.S. sovereignty in exchange for an agreement by the United States to build the canal and to provide a regular annual payment to Panama. Although the U.S. government later agreed to pay $25 million to Colombia, the episode embittered Colombian-U.S. relations for many years.\\" The canal was constructed from 1904 to 1914.

During the war, he was credited with around 40 aerial victories for which he was twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. After the war he remained in the military and reached the rank of general-lieutenant, retiring in 1989. He died in 2010 at the age of 88. Early life Popkov was born on 1 May 1922 to a working class Russian family in Moscow; he grew up in Sochi from 1930 to 1934 before moving to Abkhazia. After graduating from the Gagra Glider School in 1938 he returned to Moscow, where he went on to graduate from his tenth grade of school and aeroclub training before entering the military in September 1940. Upon graduating from the Chuguev Military Aviation School of Pilots in September 1941 he began further training at the Batay Military Aviation School of Pilots, which had been relocated to Azerbaijan due to the war. After graduating in March he was posted to the 4th Reserve Aviation Regiment based in Morshansk.  World War II  In May 1942 Popkov arrived at the warfront as a pilot in the 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. Upon seeing one of the LaGG-3 aircraft used by the regiment parked at the airfield he became very excited and jumped into the plane to check out the cockpit, but was stopped by a soldier on duty and told to wait for his shift. Soon he had a turn to fly it, and on 10 June he shot down his first enemy aircraft, a Ju-88. On 3 August 1942 he was shot down, but survived the incident with severe burns and shrapnel wounds having parachuted out. The next month he gained his third and last aerial victory while flying the LaGG-3 before moving on to flying the La-5, which he flew for most of the war and gained most of his shootdowns on, having flown it in \\"free-hunting\\" missions.–ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª ¬´–ê–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏—è –∏ –∫–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–∏–∫–∞¬ª ‚Ññ8 –æ—Ç 1968 –≥–æ–¥ (—Å—Ç—Ä. 9‚Äì12) Popkov quickly rose through the ranks of his unit, reaching the position of flight commander by the time he was first nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union in August 1943 for having shot down 17 enemy aircraft over the course of 168 sorties. On 16 August 1944 Popkov was again injured in combat after his plane was hit by an anti-aircraft shell during a mission to attack an enemy airfield. Wounds to his right hand and right leg forced him to steer his plane with his left hand, but nevertheless he managed to issue instructions to the aircraft under his command and make a safe landing at their destination airfield; later that month he was promoted to the rank of captain. At the time he was nominated for his second gold star in February 1945 he had reached the position of squadron commander in addition to having just gained his first aerial victories on the La-7 earlier that month. By the end of the war he was credited with 345 sorties, 85 aerial engagements, and an estimated 40 aerial victories (one of which was an enemy aircraft rammed during a mid-air collision); seven of the aircraft he shot down were multi-engined. Throughout the conflict he participated in Rzhev- Sychev, Little Saturn, Luhansk, Izyum-Barvenkovo, Belgorod-Kharkov, Donbass, Zaporizhia, Dnepropetrovsk, Lvov-Sandomierz, Sandomierz-Silesian, Lower Silesian, Berlin and Prague battles.  Postwar  Until March 1946 Popkov remained a squadron commander in his wartime regiment, during which he was stationed in Austria and Hungary. He then briefly served as squadron commander in the 721st Fighter Aviation Regiment until July that year when he left to join the Air Force Academy. After graduating in 1951 he served as commander of the 925th Fighter Aviation Regiment until May 1954, after which he commanded the 24th Guards Fighter Aviation Division until December 1955. From then until 1956 he served as assistant commander of the Air Force of the 4th Navy. He then became the assistant commander of the Baltic Fleet Air Force, and in 1958 he assumed the role of deputy commander. That same year he was promoted to the rank general-major, but it was not until 1962 that he entered the Military Academy of General Staff, which he graduated from in 1964 with honors. From 1964 to 1966 Popkov headed a department at the Directorate of the General Staff, and from then until 1980 he served as inspector-general of Aviation for the Air Force Naval Inspectorate. He then became the head of faculty for training foreign specialists, and from 1987 until he retired he was head of special faculty at the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy. During his career he flew many aircraft including the Yak-9, MiG-15, MiG-17, Tu-16, and An-24. After retiring from the military with the rank of general-lieutenant in 1989, he lived in Moscow where he died on 6 February 2010 and was buried in the Novodevichy cemetery.

Having been interested in horse racing since a young age, Owen won the regional final of an amateur sports commentator competition, organised by BBC Radio 2 and sponsored by Fosters Lager, in 1989. He finished third in the nationwide final. Following this breakthrough, he began commentating on horse racing for BBC Radio Wales, starting with the 1989 Welsh National won by Bonanza Boy. He contributed to both the Sporting Life and Racing Post from 1992, providing in-running comments for individual races. Following the closure of the Sporting Life, he continued to work for the Racing Post and still contributes to the present day - mainly at local racecourses such as Bangor-On-Dee, Chester and Haydock Park. Joining the racecourse commentary team in 1997, Owen made his debut at Wolverhampton on 29 March. By the end of 2010, he had called at 40 of Britain's 60 racecourses. In 2011, Kempton Park, Yarmouth, Towcester and Plumpton will be new additions to his list, taking the total to forty-four. Following a decision by the BBC to add a fourth commentator to their Grand National team, Owen joined Jim McGrath, Ian Bartlett and Tony O'Hehir for the 2004 running of the Aintree spectacular - taking the field from Valentine's Brook to the Melling Road.

The 16th tropical storm and 8th hurricane of the 1986 Pacific hurricane season, Paine formed on September 28 off the southeast coast of Mexico. It moved around a ridge, later turning to the north and brushing the Baja California Peninsula. By that time, Paine had attained peak winds of 100 mph (155 km/h), but it weakened slightly before hitting the Mexican state of Sonora. The remnant moisture combined with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall in the south-central United States. In Mexico, Paine produced rainfall along much of the coastline, with maxima in inland Oaxaca, Jalisco, and Sonora where it moved ashore. Prior to the arrival of the remnants of Paine in the United States, there was an extended period of heavy rainfall, which caused at least 10 deaths, forced thousands of people from their homes, and resulted in heavy flooding damage. The moisture from Paine produced the highest daily rainfall for any station in Oklahoma. Severe river flooding occurred along the Osage and Arkansas Rivers. The overall flooding event caused $350 million in damage, of which half came from crop losses. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Paine were from a system that entered the eastern Pacific Ocean through Central America on September 27. By the next day, it organized into Tropical Depression 27 while located about 185 miles (300 km) southwest of the coast of Guatemala. With a high pressure system to its north, the depression moved generally westward at first, although an approaching upper-level trough influenced a more northerly track. The depression slowly organized while paralleling the Mexican coastline, and it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Paine on September 30, while the storm was about 350 miles (565 km) west-southwest of Acapulco. Tropical Storm Paine quickly intensified after it was first upgraded to a tropical storm. Late on September 30, a NOAA reconnaissance plane flew into the storm, one of two cyclones in the basin that warranted aircraft data, the other being Hurricane Newton. The plane observed sustained winds of 82 mph (133 km/h), and as a result, Paine was upgraded to hurricane status. As it neared the Baja California Peninsula, the hurricane turned more northward, and late on October 1 reached peak winds of 100 mph (155 km/h), while located just offshore of the southern tip of Baja California. Hurricane Paine did not intensify further due to the presence of mid-level wind shear, as well as insufficient moisture in the air; nevertheless, it was located over an area of water temperatures. The outer eyewall moved across Cabo San Lucas, and the resultant land interaction was believed to have slightly weakened the inner core of the hurricane. Flooding near Oklahoma City After reaching its peak intensity, the hurricane turned north-northeastward, making landfall near San Jos√©, Sonora with winds of 90 mph (145 km/h). Paine rapidly dissipated over land, although the remnants continued northeastward across Mexico into Texas and the south- central United States. Moisture from the system combined with an advancing cold front, producing heavy rainfall over Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. Impact As a tropical cyclone, Paine brought rainfall to most of Mexico, including heavier amounts along the coastline and interior northern Oaxaca. The highest total in the country was 12.01 inches (30.5 cm) in Apazulco, Jalisco. Light precipitation fell in the southern portion of the Baja California Peninsula, and where Paine moved ashore, upwards of 7 inches (18 cm) fell across its path. In the area around where it made landfall, strong winds knocked down trees and caused disruptions to city services. Rainfall summary of Paine In the south-central United States, the remnants of Paine dropped moderate to heavy rainfall in regions that already received above normal rainfall. Isolated locations in Texas, northern Oklahoma, and southeastern Kansas received over 10 inches (25.4 cm) of precipitation, and the highest total in the United States was 11.35 inches (28.8 cm) at Fort Scott, Kansas. Moderate rainfall extended northeastward through Missouri and Illinois. In Barnsdall, Oklahoma, a station recorded 10.42 inches (26.5 cm) on September 29, which was the highest daily precipitation for any station in the state. In combination with previous storms, some locations received over 20 inches of rainfall in an 8-day period, which produced severe river flooding along the Osage and Arkansas Rivers. The flooding resulted in record discharge rates along many streams and creeks, while many reservoirs were nearly filled to capacity. The Mississippi River in St. Louis reached the fifth highest flood stage on record. Prior to its arrival, flooding across the central United States killed six people, forced thousands of people from their homes, and left at least $76 million in damage (1986 USD). Additional flooding from Paine exacerbated the situation; the flooding affected 52 of the 77 counties in Oklahoma, which resulted in a total of $350 million in damage, half of which from agriculture. The remnants of Paine brought about the end of the extended period of rainfall, which overall had forced 55,000 people from their homes, including 1,200 in East Saint Louis, Illinois where a floodgate broke. It was described as one of the worst floods in Oklahoma history.

This chart is available on the OpenSeaMap website, and can also be downloaded for use as an electronic chart for offline applications.Hydro International: OpenSeaMap - the Free Nautical Chart The project is part of OpenStreetMap. OpenSeaMap is part of the OpenStreetMap database, and complements the spatial data with nautical information. Such data may be used in accordance with the Open Database License. This ensures integration into printed materials, websites and applications is possible, without being limited by restrictive licenses, or having to pay fees.  History  The idea for the project was born at an OpenStreetMap developer conference in autumn 2008 at the Linux Hotel in Essen, Germany. A group of boaters and programmers decided to extend the coverage of OpenStreetMap to the seas and fresh water bodies. From the start the project has been worldwide and multilingual. By the end of 2009, the design and architecture of the project had been created, and a sample harbor \\"Warnem√ºnde\\" was created to serve as an example chart. Since autumn 2009, a dedicated server has been available and the project is engaged in several collaborations with other free projects and organizations. In January 2010 OpenSeaMap was given a stand at boot D√ºsseldorf, Europe's largest boat show, allowing volunteers to present the project to a large audience of specialists for the first time.  Contents of the chart  left Charts will show lighthouses, lateral buoy, cardinal marks and other navigational aids. In the ports, facilities will be mapped (port wall, pier, walkways, docks, fueling stations, loading cranes, access roads, railway lines, ferry lines). Similarly, public authorities, shipbuilders and repairers, as well as sanitation and utility facilities will be displayed. The navigational attributes correspond to the international standard IHO S-57. Water depths are not yet covered, because the database is not designed for three-dimensional coordinates. However, the plan is to eventually integrate a bathymetric model to describe the seabed. The data are presented in multiple levels with OpenLayers on the base map of OpenStreetMap. The base map contains all the possible objects from OpenStreetMap.map elements \\"Map Features \\" OpenSeaMap includes additional layers such as aids to navigation, ports and temporary racing events.  Applications  The chart is for planning sailing and boat trips. It will also be useful as a guide for tourists. It is not intended to replace official charts. ; Online Map : The map is available to any computer with an internet connection from the website OpenSeaMap.org. This map is updated daily. ; Offline Map : The map can also be loaded on local data storage and can be used on any PC without internet access. This map will also permit use on other devices, such as GPS devices from Garmin and Lowrance, phones, and PDAs. The off-map is regularly updated, usually every week. ; App for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch : The paid App for OpenSeaMap works on iPad, iPhone und iPod touch.App for OpenSeaMap for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch The actual position is shown on the chart. Each downloaded chart is cached on the device and can be used without internet connection. With internet connection the app checks if there is a newer version of the chart.

Road spray or tire kickup is road debris (usually liquid water) that has been kicked up, pushed out, or sprayed out from a tire. In 2004, a AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety study revealed that vehicle-related road debris caused 25,000 accidents and nearly 100 deaths a year.

In the year 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Traffic Safety Facts found that more than 800 persons were killed across America by \\"non-fixed objects\\" (a term that includes roadway debris). California had the highest number of total deaths for any state, while New Mexico had the greatest probability for death from a vehicle-debris crash in that year.http://www- nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811754AR.pdf In 2004, a AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety study revealed that vehicle-related road debris caused 25,000 accidents‚Äîand nearly 100 deaths‚Äîeach year. At highway speeds, even small debris can be deadly. On June 16, 1925, in the United States, a passenger train carrying German and American tourists from Chicago, Illinois to Hoboken, New Jersey struck debris washed into a road crossing and derailed during a heavy thunderstorm. Collision with road debris resulted in a solar vehicle accident at the World Solar Challenge 2007 in Australia. Road debris, for the most part, tends to collect in areas where two-track vehicles such as cars and buses do not drive. In urban areas, this tends to be on the edges (shoulder) and on the crown of the road, and debris frequently collects around traffic islands and junctions. In rural areas, debris collects in the middle of the lane and on the outside of corners and bends.\\"Road Debris\\", British Motorcyclists Federation, Christopher Hodder, June 2007 Road debris can be especially dangerous to bicyclists, who may have to travel outside the cycle lane and into traffic to avoid debris. Flooding can also occur if storm drains and street gutters are not kept clear of road debris and litter. Large quantities of water are sometimes thrown up from the road (road spray) by large vehicles, creating visibility problems for the drivers of oncoming, nearby, or following vehicles. Following vehicles may reduce the problem by slowing and increasing the following/separation distance. Headlights (or fog lights) improve vehicle visibility for all drivers, including those dealing with the spray. Driving manuals advise against following vehicles too closely (tailgating) in these hazardous conditions. Road spray can cause reduced visibility and dramatically reduce the safety of motorists.\\"Splash and spray from wet pavements increase safety risks for motorists and are a concern for road authorities.\\", Australian Asphalt Pavement Association, retrieved 7 March 2010 Over time, road spray and gunk from [a bicycle's] brake pads coat the rim of the wheel, interfering with braking power.

Roadside soil and water contamination can result when the concentration of harmful constituents is high enough. The greater the surface area of synthetic rubber waste fragments, the greater the potential for breakdown into harmful constituents. For leached tire debris, the potential environmental impact of the ingredients zinc and organic toxicants has been demonstrated. Additionally, debris from lawns in local communities can flush into local waterways. There are currently some laws against blowing organic matter such as grass clippings into the roadway because of their potential toxic effect on the local waterways. Grass being high in nitrogen, which can accumulate in waterways and cause algae blooms. An example of such laws can be seen in the City of Davenport, Iowa's Clean Air and Water Act. Prevention A car bra can help reduce damage from minor road debris. Road spray is lessened on stone mastic asphalt and open-graded asphalt and can be further reduced with fenders'07 Buyer's Guide, Bicycling, April 2007, p. 100 (more so on a bicycle since most motor vehicles tend to already have fenders) and/or mud flaps. Street sweepers and winter service vehicles remove most solid road debris and the Adopt a Highway program also helps. Road signs and variable-message signs may warn drivers of special situations involving road debris. The American Automobile Association (AAA) publishes the following recommendations: Education * Motor vehicle operators should know and understand how to secure their loads, load securement requirements, littering laws, and penalties for failing to comply with the regulations. * Drivers carrying loads should periodically inspect their vehicles and cargo to make sure they remain safe and secure. * All drivers should be aware of the surroundings and continuously inspect the road for potential hazards. * Drivers should immediately report unsafe vehicles and unsecured loads. Laws and policy enforcement * Governments should enact and enforce legislation requiring loads to be covered, or use anti-littering legislation to penalize offenders. * Fines and demerit points for unsecured loads should be increased. * Road debris incidents and crashes should be made an absolute-liability offense. Removal and mitigation In 1914 St. Louis, Missouri, litter was removed from streets by water wagons, as shown in this drawing by Marguerite Martyn of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch * Maintenance organizations should perform regular road inspection and timely removal of debris. * Better roadway design provides adequate visibility of stationary objects in the roadway to motorists traveling at highway speeds. * Increasing the dispersion of Traffic cones around roadway areas.

The station was originally included in Northstar plans, but it was cut in order to meet the Federal Transit Administration's cost-effectiveness index (CEI). The current park-and- ride facility is located on a sliver of land in between Minnesota State Highway 610 and Foley Boulevard. It has 3,200 parking spaces with a surface lot and a two-story parking ramp, giving it more than four times the capacity of the largest existing Northstar station, Elk River (754 spaces). Despite the fact that it already existed and would be a significant source of riders, calculation of the cost-effectiveness index was biased toward saving time of commuters. Riders would not save enough time by changing from the existing bus service to rail, so the station was dropped. Anoka County and the city of Coon Rapids have been acquiring land and making arrangements for matching funds for the station. It is expected to cost approximately $15 million to build the station. Construction will likely occur along with a related project to add a third set of rails along this stretch of track, which is the busiest in Minnesota. The third main line will allow additional passenger rail traffic, including the proposed Northern Lights Express project to connect to Duluth.

Wisconsin Constitution, Dec. 2009.https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/wiscon/_20 BCPL was organized upon Wisconsin's statehood to oversee the sale of School Trust Lands, public lands allotted by Congress to finance primary, secondary and post-secondary public education in a then land rich but cash poor nation. Once encompassing over 1.5 million acres, a little less than of the original land grants conveyed to Wisconsin remain under BCPL's stewardship; these lands are largely forested and therefore harvested for sustainable timber, the proceeds of which are deposited to both the Common School Fund and to the Normal School Fund.https://bcpl.wisconsin.gov/Pages/SchoolTrustLands.aspx The remaining School Trust Lands are free and accessible to the public, for hunting, fishing, trapping, hiking, and other outdoor recreational activities. BCPL prioritizes managing its remaining School Trust Lands efficiently and sustainably, with an eye towards guaranteeing productivity, protecting water quality, maintaining biodiversity, and enhancing public access.https://bcpl.wisconsin.gov/Pages/SchoolTrustLands.aspx Trust funds and beneficiaries Proceeds from the sale and management of the School Trust Lands constitute a significant proportion of the principal incident to the four School Trust Funds managed by BCPL: the Common School Fund, tNormal School Fund, University Fund, and Agricultural College Fund.Trust Funds, Board of Commissioners of Public Lands The Common School Fund was created from the sale of the 16th section in each of Wisconsin's townships;this amounted to almost . The U.S. Congress later added to the Common School Fund's principal by allocating an additional of school lands. In addition, the state grants to the Common School Fund all fines, fees, and forfeitures for violations of the criminal laws, alongside all unclaimed property and escheated property that accrues to the state. Income from the Common School Fund is remitted annually to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction for distribution to public schools as public school library aid.Wisconsin's Common School Fund, Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction These annual distributions are the only source of statewide aid for Wisconsin's public-school libraries.https://bcpl.wisconsin.gov/Pages/CommonSchoolFund.aspx The Normal School Fund was created in 1865 from the sale of half of the land grant Congress conveyed to Wisconsin in the Swamp Land Act of 1850 after the Wisconsin Legislature determined not all of the land was needed to finance land reclamation activities. The Normal School Fund was originally intended to provide financial support to normal schools, or state teacher colleges. Since Wisconsin's state teacher colleges merged with the University of Wisconsin System in 1971, the Normal School Fund now primarily finances scholarships and environmental education programming at the University of Wisconsin System. The University Fund was created from congressional grants in 1838 and 1854 of four townships to be sold to support a land-grant university. Neither Congress nor the Legislature provided for additional revenues to the University Fund following the sale of most of the university lands. Interest on the remaining trust fund principal is distributed annually from the University Fund to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Agriculture College Fund was created from the proceeds of land grant allocated to the state by the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act. The state received of land under this Act. Neither Congress nor the Legislature provided for additional revenues to the Agricultural College Fund following the rapid sale of the agricultural college lands. Interest on trust fund principal is distributed annually from the Agricultural College Fund to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the state's land-grant university.

In 2006 for example, BCPL purchased $2 million in state bonds to benefit the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs.

Early life In 1969, whilst playing in a cup final for Wyndham Primary School, Gregson was noticed by Coventry City scout, Jimmy Nichol. At the end of the match Nichol approached Gregson's father with an invitation for his son to take part in trials at the club during the school summer holidays of that year. Gregson took part in the trials and was accompanied to Coventry by his father. He repeated his trials with the club during the Easter holidays of 1970. Gregson represented various youth clubs including Newcastle City Boy's (1969‚Äì74), Newbiggin Hall Boy's Club (1971‚Äì72) and Montagu & North Fenham Boy's Club (1972‚Äì74) being the club his father, Gordon, had played for 1949‚Äì50. In 1971 Gregson was noticed by West Bromwich Albion scout, Bill Emery and was invited to take part in trials at the club during the Christmas holidays of that year. In 1972, after having had trials with Newcastle United and Sunderland, he signed Associated Schoolboy Forms with WBA which prevented other clubs from approaching him. He regularly took part in trials at the club until he left school in 1974. In late 1972, whilst representing Montagu & North Fenham Boy's Club, Gregson took part in a televised penalty competition held at St James' Park and scored 6 out of 10 penalties against the Newcastle United goalkeeper, Iam McFaul. The show was later broadcast on Tyne Tees Television's sports programme, \\"Sportstime\\", presented by George Taylor. Club career West Bromwich Albion On 1 July 1974, Gregson joined West Bromwich Albion, then recently relegated to Division Two and managed by Don Howe, as an Apprentice Professional. At the end of his first season he helped WBA win the Midland Intermediate Cup by scoring in the 1st leg of the final (1-1) against Shrewsbury Town at the Hawthorns. In May, 1975, he was a member of the Albion squad that took part in the International Youth Tournament held in Augsburg, Germany. At the end of the season, Don Howe's contract with WBA expired and was not renewed. He was replaced by the ex-Leeds United and Republic of Ireland midfielder, John Giles, as player manager. The 1975‚Äì76 season saw Gregson, as a 17-year-old, immediately become a regular in Albion's reserve team and in one Central League match (20 December 1975) at Burnley, he scored the equaliser in a 2‚Äì2 draw with a 25-yard shot whilst playing alongside the ex-England legend, Geoff Hurst, recently signed from Stoke City. It was reported, \\"Gregson's 79th minute equaliser - a dipping shot 25 yards out, hammered in after he had cut in from the right, came just one minute after Burnley had taken the 2‚Äì1 lead their play during the second half had merited\\" also \\"and then came Gregson's spectacular equaliser\\". During the same season Gregson represented West Bromwich Albion in trials, held at, Lilleshall, Shropshire, for the England Youth Team (U18). He later signed full professional forms with the club, 20 January 1976. Gregson was a key player for Albion's youth team during their FA Youth Cup winning campaign of 1975‚Äì76. Before defeating Wolverhampton Wanderers in the two-legged final, Albion had already defeated Coventry City, Charlton Athletic, Ipswich Town, Manchester United and Crystal Palace. In the 3rd round home tie (15 December 1975) when Albion were a goal down and with only 30 minutes of the game remaining, Gregson scored a hat-trick against Charlton Athletic, to ensure Albion reached the 4th round. It was reported, \\"But then Gregson took over. He equalised in the 60th minute with a brilliant solo effort, beating three men before shooting past the keeper\\". During the 5th round tie against Manchester United at The Hawthorns, (Tuesday, 9 March 1976) it was reported, \\"Summerfield's equaliser was again the result of a Lynex cross with Colin Gregson setting up the goal with a brilliant pass from midfield\\". During the first leg of the semi-final clash (Monday, 29 March 1976) at home to Crystal Palace, Gregson created two of Albion's goals from a corner and a free kick and also scored with a penalty in the resulting 3‚Äì2 win. In the first leg of the final (Tuesday, 27 April 1976) at Wolverhampton Wanderers, he created the first goal, scored by Kevin Summerfield, with a defence-splitting pass and was voted man of the match. Albion went on to win the match 2‚Äì0 and secured the trophy, for the first and only time in the club's history, with a 3‚Äì0 win in the second leg at the Hawthorns (Monday, 3 May 1976). Towards the end of the season, Gregson made his debut in Albion's first team during a private friendly against Crewe Alexandra at the Hawthorns. The match was arranged by John Giles to enable him to observe how some of Albion's younger players performed against more senior players. At the end of the season WBA had won the FA Youth Cup, finished second to Liverpool in the Central League, and gained promotion back to Division One. The 1976‚Äì77 season saw Gregson continue as a regular in Albion's reserve team and towards the end of the season Sheffield Wednesday, then in Division Three and managed by Len Ashurst, expressed an interest in him. Peterborough United, then also in Division Three and managed by the ex-Vice President of the League Managers Association, John Barnwell, also expressed an interest in signing him and invited him to play for Peterborough in a home friendly match (12 May 1977) against Nottingham Forest, then in Division Two and managed by Brian Clough. The full-strength Forest team featured players such as Ian Bowyer and the future England International, Tony Woodcock. Gregson played the full 90 minutes of the match and within weeks Forest had gained promotion back to the First Division. Within two years they had won the First Division Title and the European Championship. Sheffield Wednesday Gregson eventually chose to sign for Sheffield Wednesday and made his first appearance for the club Saturday, 20 August 1977 during a Central League match at Sheffield United. It was reported, \\"Gregson, the newcomer from West Brom, was playing extremely well in midfield for Wednesday, he was instrumental in breaking up many of the dangerous home attacks\\". Tuesday, 30 August 1977, saw him make his debut, as a 19-year-old, in the first team during a League Cup match away at Blackpool (score 2‚Äì2). Wednesday's second goal of the match occurred after Gregson challenged Blackpool's goalkeeper who, under pressure from the challenge, dropped the ball to enable another Wednesday player to score. It was reported, \\"Colin Gregson was drafted into the team in place of the injured Rodger Wylde and made a promising debut\\". He went on to make his debut in the Football League, Saturday 1 October 1977 away at Portsmouth (score 2‚Äì2). However, on 5 October 1977, Len Ashurst was sacked by Wednesday, and reserve team coach, Ken Knighton, appointed as caretaker manager. After the appointment of the new manager, Jack Charlton, Gregson made one further appearance in the first team as a second-half substitute away at Exeter City (score 1‚Äì1), and although he never featured in the new manager's future plans, he continued to perform to a high standard, as demonstrated by various match reports, in the reserve team. During one match, Saturday, 4 March 1978, giving Wednesday a 2‚Äì1 victory, he scored both goals passed the Manchester United goalkeeper, Alex Stepney, who had played for United during the 1968 European Cup Final. It was reported, \\"Wednesday's first goal was rocketed into the net by Gregson\\" and \\"Gregson crowned a workmanlike performance with the winner (a header created from a cross by the ex-WBA & Scottish International, Bobby Hope) five minutes from the end\\". At the beginning of the 1978‚Äì79 season Maurice Setters was appointed as Wednesday's new reserve team coach after the departure of Ken Knighton to manage Sunderland. During an away match at Derby County,\\"Gregson fired in an unstoppable drive from 30 yards which left County's goalkeeper bemused and rooted to his line\\". During a later match, Gregson scored the winner to give Wednesday a 3‚Äì2 victory over Everton. It was reported, \\"Colin Gregson's brilliant 80th minute header gave impressive Wednesday their ninth successive win after they had trailed 0‚Äì2 after 15 minutes\\". On 13 March 1979, Gregson played for Wednesday's reserve team in an away match at Manchester City. The City team featured the former England international, Colin Bell MBE, and the Polish International, Kaziu Deyna, who had played for Poland during the 1974 World Cup Finals. Denmark In May 1979, Gregson left Sheffield Wednesday and spent a week in Denmark training with Randers Freja, managed by ex-Aston Villa coach, Frank Upton. Upton had made the invitation to Gregson after travelling to England to watch him play. At the end of his stay, Gregson expected to be offered a two-year contract but the deal was never finalised due to the apparent abrupt departure from the club by Upton. Berwick Rangers After returning to the UK, Gregson was invited for a trial with Berwick Rangers who had then just gained promotion to the Scottish First Division (now the Scottish Championship). After impressing during a pre-season friendly at Galashiels, he was offered a two-year contract by player/manager, Dave Smith. He made his debut for the club, Saturday 28 July 1979, against Glasgow Rangers at Ibrox Park in the 1st round of the Drybrough Cup. He made his debut in the Scottish Football League, Saturday 11 August, against Airdrie. Unfortunately, he missed three months of the season due to sustaining a serious knee injury but later returned for a match at Arbroath, 1 December 1979, when it was reported, \\"In the midfield Gregson was the pick. Despite not having played competitively for 12 weeks he filled the gap left by Jim Morton's departure with admirable success. A player who likes to get involved in things, he might prove to be more effective than Morton has this season\\". The match was broadcast the following day as the main match on Scottish Television's sports programme, \\"Scotsport\\". Gregson made his last appearance for Berwick, Saturday, 20 August 1980, during a Scottish League Cup fixture against Aberdeen. Shortly afterwards he requested that his contract with the club be terminated by mutual consent, due to the excessive travelling involved from his home in Newcastle to away games in Scotland. He then had a short spell with local non-league club, Blyth Spartans. Australia In 1981, Gregson joined Australian National League club, West Adelaide, then managed by Englishman Billy Birch, but by the time Gregson arrived at the club Birch had been sacked and replaced by Yugoslavian coach, Peter Jaksa. After an away match at South Melbourne, which involved a return journey by plane, it was reported, \\"New English import Gregson, went on against South for the last 20 minutes and impressed\\". Jaksa was also quoted, with reference to the next match, as saying, \\"I must also seriously consider fielding Colin Gregson from the kick-off this time, Gregson looks good but he is still not fully fit\\". The South Melbourne team featured the ex-Wolverhampton Wanderers, Liverpool & Aston Villa striker, Alun Evans.

The '53' route ran from Brooks's Bar to Cheetham Hill Road, via Belle Vue, forming an angular shape; two low bridges at Pottery Lane and Stanley Grove made running double-deckers impossible.

Members of the then Manchester Transport Historical Collection (MTHC) (later to become the Manchester Transport Museum Society (MTMS)) set about preserving the tram in 1960. For a period the tram was stored at the National Tramway Museum, Crich but was moved to the Birchfields Road depot in Rusholme, Manchester for restoration. After restoration it returned to Crich for a couple of years before returning to Manchester in 1979. Since then it has operated on the Heaton Park Tramway.

Screenplay by Leonid Bykov, Yevgeny Onopriyenko and Aleksandr Satsky. Original music by Viktor Shevchenko, cinematography by Vladimir Voytenko. Runtime 92 min. Production by Dovzhenko Film Studios.  Plot  The film combines two storylines: the main war drama plot is runs in parallel with vivid artistic performance ‚Äî the fighter squadron doubles as an amateur musical group during rest time, led by its enthusiastic commander turned conductor. The title comes from two scenes in the film, where the squadron is facing very hard dogfights with German fighter planes, so only ¬´old men¬ª are sent up, while those fresh from flying school have to wait on the ground together with the mechanics. Soon, of course, the newcomers have replaced most of those veterans and have become ¬´old men¬ª themselves, taking to the skies while a new group of newcomers wait on the ground with the mechanics.  Plot Summary  The movie begins in the late summer of 1943 during the Battle of the Dnieper. The pilots of the 2nd Squadron of the Fighter Aircraft Guard Regiment are returning from the mission. However, the commanding officer, captain Titarenko, also known as ¬´Maestro¬ª, is missing. Nobody (except for Makarych, the technician) even hopes he make it, since he didn‚Äôt even had enough fuel, but when suddenly the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 shows up and lands on the airfield. It turns out that Maestro was shot down behind the enemy lands, however, the advancing USSR infantry saved him and he received a war trophy aircraft on an advance airfield. The next day the reinforcements come to the regiment and are being assigned to the squadrons. Several newcomers, including Second Lieutenant Aleksandrov and Third Lieutenants Shchedronov and Sagdullayev, ask for a place in a 2nd Squadron. Titarenko inquires about their musical skills: 2nd Squadron is also known as ¬´Singing Squadron¬ª, since at a free time they perform as an amateur orchestra with the commander himself being the conductor. Shchedronov sings ¬´Darkie¬ª, earning the corresponding nickname. Having only had a brief chat with reinforcements, the ¬´old men¬ª take off to intercept a group of German bombers. Experienced pilots don‚Äôt allow the newcomers with them, saying only ¬´you‚Äôll have your share of fighting soon enough¬ª: they know that the new pilots only received a basic training due to shortened curriculum, and are not battle ready. They all return to the airfield safely, however, Maestro is furious: his wingman, First Lieutenant Skvortzov, left the battle without permit, and it appears he did so not for the first time. They have a serious discussion and it turns out that during the Battle of Kursk Skvortzov had barely survived an encounter with German ace pilot and since then has a subconscious fear of dogfights. Depressed Skvortzov asks to be released from an active duty and to be enlisted to an infantry regiment instead, however, Titarenko burns the report, deciding to give a friend another chance. In between missions 2nd Squadron rehearses performances. Even Aleksandrov, despite being averse to music, plays tambourine and soon begins to run the rehearsals in lieu of the captain. Eventually, the newcomers are allowed to fly. Aleksandrov crash lands his aircraft, destroying it in the process and receives a strict reprimand from the captain. However, he doesn‚Äôt take it seriously and light-heartedly goes to the field to catch some grasshoppers. Enraged Titarenko suspends lieutenant from flying and puts him on ¬´eternal airfield duty¬ª, while the rest of the officers begin to call Aleksandrov ¬´Grasshopper¬ª. Titarenko leaves on a reconnaissance mission on a trophy Messerschmitt. In his absence, a light bomber Polikarpov Po-2, piloted by female officers Zoya and Masha, takes forced landing on the airfield. Sagdullayev promptly falls in love with Masha, earning himself a nickname ¬´Romeo¬ª. Titarenko, who returned from a recon mission, confirms an info about a large group of a German tanks nearby. When he decides the reinforcements (except for Grasshopper) are battle ready, he performs another reconnaissance flight. He finds out that Germans have camouflaged their tanks with hay bales and sheds, but he‚Äôs shot down on his way back. Maestro is saved by an allied infantry, which, however, takes him for a German pilot. They aren‚Äôt persuaded neither with his Soviet uniform nor with his perfect russian language, and try to lynch him. However, when an infantryman slaps Titarenko in the face, he punches the soldier back, knocking him from his knees ‚Äî that reassures the rest of the soldiers, who are sure that the German wouldn‚Äôt try to fight back in a situation like this. The infantrymen gift captain a horse, which he uses to get back to an airfield. Having returned, he learns from Makarych that during his absence Darkie has been killed: he was practicing cooperative actions with his partner and was shot down by a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 ace. In the meantime, Romeo confesses his love to Masha. Titarenko joins CPSU and receives a task to lead newcomers by example and to demonstrate them vulnerability of frightening G√∂ring‚Äôs ace pilots. Maestro challenges Germans to a ¬´joust¬ª, but at the very beginning of a fight he decides that this is the last opportunity for his wingman to prove himself. Titarenko feigns a weapon malfunction, putting himself in a mortal peril, and Skvortzov overcomes his fear and comes to the rescue, shooting down one of the enemy aircraft. The next day, German air forces perform a raid on the airfield. Still suspended from flights, Grasshopper steals commander‚Äôs fighter, takes off and shoots down an enemy aircraft, saving the base. The squadron gives a performance, which, among the others, is attended by a female pilots from a nearby regiment. Skvortzov performs a song Moonlight Night. The next day he performs a suicide ramming attack, directing his flaming aircraft to an enemy railway. More time passes. USSR territory is almost completely liberated from German occupation. The ¬´old men¬ª are preparing for battle, however, this now includes Romeo (first lieutenant, Maestro‚Äôs wingman) and Grasshopper (first lieutenant, 2nd Squadron commander), while Maestro himself is already a major and a regiment commander. Fifteen minutes before takeoff, Romeo asks Maestro‚Äôs permission to get married (since both he and Masha can be shot down any day) which Titarenko gives right away. Once again the ¬´old men¬ª take off, and the newcomers from the reinforcements are left on the airfield. The regiment returns from the mission, but it turns out that Romeo is heavily wounded. He manages to make it to the airfield and lands safely, but succumbs to his wounds right afterwards. When Maestro, Makarych and Grasshopper go to the female regiment to deliver sad news to Masha, they learn that both Masha and Zoya were also killed that day. Makarych and Titarenko locate girl‚Äôs graves and promise to return here and to sing ¬´Darkie¬ª once again ¬´from the beginning to the end¬ª once the war is over.

The story is based on the memoirs of the Soviet fighter ace Vitaly Popkov who fought with a real- life singing squadron boasting own amateur choir. The squadron even toured the Soviet rear with concerts and received fighter planes built with money donated by Soviet star musicians. Most of the elder cast and production members fought the war themselves. Actor Aleksei Smirnov (Makarych) was a decorated war hero, an artillery sergeant; also a battlefield amateur musician as well.  Awards  The film won most of the Soviet bloc film prizes at the time, including the first prize in the 7th All-Union Film Festival in Baku in 1974.  Colorization  In 2009 a colorized version was released for TV and DVD, which resulted in a legal battle in Ukrainian courts between the copyright owners, Leonid Bykov‚Äôs daughter and Ukrainian Dovzhenko Film Studios, and the company behind the colorization, as the copyright owners claim that the colorization has been done against the wishes of Bykov, who intentionally chose to do the film in black and white, in order to match newly shot scenes with the newsreel material in the film. In May 2011, the District Court of Kiev ruled that the colorization was a breach of copyright and that the colorized version can‚Äôt be shown or rented in Ukraine. The director re-worked the film‚Äôs script to suit being shot in black and white after being denied color film stock on the grounds that color film was reserved for films about socialist realism.
