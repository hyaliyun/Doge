State voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background During its years as a territory the Republican Party's ancestral hostility to the polygyny of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church),Talbot, Christine; A Foreign Kingdom: Mormons and Polygamy in American Political Culture, 1852-1890, p. 113 whose members settled Utah and have dominated the region ever since, meant that Utah territorial politics until 1891 was dominated by the Mormon-hierarchy- controlled \\"People's Party\\" and the anti-Mormon \\"Liberal Party\\".May, Dean L. ; Utah: A People's History, pp. 120-121 Those Mormons who did affiliate with national parties generally were Democrats, who lacked moral qualms associated with polygyny and slavery ‚Äì although the Liberal Party did have allies within the GOP.Handy, Robert T.; Undermined Establishment: Church-State Relations in America, 1880-1920, p. 55 In order to achieve statehood, however, the LDS Church disbanded the \\"People's Party\\" in 1891 and most LDS members moved towards the Democratic Party. In Utah's statehood year ‚Äì 1896 ‚Äì Democrat/Populist William Jennings Bryan, whose \\"free silver\\" platform was immensely attractive to a state with large silver reserves, won the Mormon State by a five-to-one margin. However, by Bryan's 1900 rematch with incumbent Republican President McKinley, the Republican Party's ancestral hostility to Mormonism was beginning to dissipate,Perry, Luke and Cronin, Christopher; Mormons in American Politics: From Persecution to Power, p. 52 and Republican National Committee Chairman \\"Dollar Mark\\" Hanna was able to persuade the Mormon hierarchy that Bryan's policies ‚Äì financial and otherwise ‚Äì were unsound.Rutland, Robert Allan (editor); The Republicans: From Lincoln to Bush, p. 128 Consequently, although the LDS Church had not established the links to the GOP that they were after the Utah legislature elected Reed Smoot, those Utah voters who had supported Bryan overwhelmingly in 1896 deserted him to a degree that narrowly proved sufficient to give the state's three electoral votes to McKinley. Apart from Washington County in the Dixie region, McKinley was competitive everywhere and in Kane County ‚Äì later a famous Republican bastion ‚Äì he received over seventy percent. This remains easily the closest presidential election in Utah history, and with the state voting essentially as the nation did, it was decisive in placing the Mormon State in the mainstream of US politics,Balmer, Randall and Riess, Janet (editors); Mormonism and American Politics (Religion, Culture, and Public Life), pp. 135-137 where Utah remained until becoming a Republican bastion in the 1950s and 1960s.

Things seem off to Jin-seok in their new home. One rainy night, he witnesses the abduction of Yoo-seok, being dragged into a car. Nineteen days pass and suddenly, Yoo-seok returns. Jin starts to notice discrepancies in his family's personality. He then realizes that they are not his family at all but people pretending to be his family. He escapes the house and goes to the police. When he tells them he is 21 years old, the officers, skeptical, ask him what year it is. He replies that it's 1997; the officer reveals that it is 2017. Jin is, in fact, 41 years old. A shocked Jin looks around and sees signs of modern life: a tablet, a smartphone; an LED flat-screen TV showing the current South Korean President Moon Jae-in and United States President Donald Trump. He leaves confused, but is captured by the same \\"family\\" that was holding him captive. The young man pretending to be his brother, \\"Yoo-seok,\\" tells Jin that twenty years ago, a little girl and her mother were murdered. The case went cold so the family of the victims hired \\"Yoo-seok\\" to find their murderer, who is Jin. In flashbacks, it is shown that Jin was abducted and tortured to confess, but maintained his innocence. A psychiatrist suggested that he had repressed his memory because the event was too traumatic. The team had the psychiatrist hypnotize him back to his last happy memory in 1997, figuring that if they can re-enact the events of the murder, Jin might be able to recover his memories and tell them what happened. Everything was going as planned until the night when Jin thought he saw Yoo-seok being abducted; he was actually arrested for fraud, and was gone for 19 days because that was how long he was in jail. Presently, Jin escapes the van and the young man crashes, while Jin accidentally gets hit by a stranger's car. He then regains his memories from 1997. In 1997, the opening scene from the film is shown, except this time, Jin is with his real parents and older brother, the real Yoo-seok. They get into a car accident that kills his parents. His brother is in critical condition and he desperately needs money for Yoo-seok's surgery but times are hard because of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Jin goes online seeking a job, and is messaged by an anonymous person, telling Jin he'll pay him to kill someone's wife, but leave the two children unharmed. Jin's conscience doesn't allow him to go through with it. He is about to leave the house but the mother sees him, then the young daughter, who starts screaming, and Jin ends up killing them both. The youngest child, a little boy, comes out, and Jin tells him to go to bed. As he leaves, he discovers that this is actually the family of his brother's doctor. Jin meets with the anonymous man, who is indeed Yoo-seok's doctor, demanding to know why the doctor would have his own family killed. The doctor explains that it was to keep his children from becoming homeless due to the financial crisis; he had taken out multiple insurance policies on his wife. Since Jin not only killed his wife but also his daughter, the doctor says Yoo-seok will die as well. A struggle ensues and the doctor is accidentally pushed to his death. In the present, Jin wakes up in a hospital. The young man survived the crash and is about to kill Jin with a poisonous needle but Jin reveals that his memory has returned. The young man reveals that he was the little boy in the house twenty years ago when Jin killed his mother and sister. After the deaths of his parents and sister, his relatives took all the money and left him to grow up in an orphanage. He begs Jin to tell him why Jin didn't kill him too and whether the murders were planned by his father. A distraught Jin takes the entire blame but the young man doesn't believe him. Jin, now knowing he did in fact commit the murders, commits suicide in his hospital room with the poisonous needle; simultaneously, the young man comes to terms with the murder of his family, and also commits suicide by jumping out of the hospital window. The film flashes back to 1997. Jin's family is at the lake. Jin is stopped by a little boy offering him a lollipop. After he kindly declines, the little boy runs to his family. It is shown that it was the doctor's family, revealing why Jin did not kill the little boy.

The Himara region had been de facto independent from the Ottoman Empire, even if it had nominally submitted to it. In the 16th century, Himariots had served in the Spanish and Venetian armies. By 1735, Naples had also made its own Albanian guard. The influence of Russia was felt across the Balkans, including by Albanians. Among those to visit Moscow to request humanitarian aid was Archbishop Gabriel in 1586, Bishop Theophilus in 1587, the Patriarch of Ohrid Athanasius, and Neofil of Korca. As Albanian revolts broke out in the early 1700s, the Emperor of Russia Peter the Great sent letters of thanks to tribes of Albania for their help and praised their bravery and sacrifice. This led to the opening of Russian consulates in Albania. In 1759, representatives of Himara address Russia's Tzarina, Elizabeth Petrovna with a letter expressing their will to fight for Russia. In 1760, Captain Spiro Bixhili, on behalf of the Assembly, handed a letter to the Russian ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, A. Obreskov. It stated that the Himariots expressed loyalty to Russia and their readiness to carry out diversion actions against the Turks in times of war, and their desire to create one or two military regiments in peacetime. Obreskov responded that Russia could not accept the creation of these units in times of peace, but it would be accepted during war. The Himariots, responding to the calls of the Russians, joined the Russian forces and participated in the Russo-Turkish war of 1768-1774. During this time they were distinguished for bravery, and were admired by the Russian generals. Over 1000 Himariot and Morean Albanians moved to Russia in 1774, and continued until 1776. After the union of Crimea with Russia, Albanian emigrants, together with Greek immigrants, settled in various villages, including Odessa. Another migration wave could have of occurred during Russian rule in Corfu in the years 1799-1807, when a unit called the \\"Albanian hunters\\" was formed under Admiral Ushakov. On March 28, 1775, an Albanian battalion, mostly from Himara and some from Morea, was formed and served in the Russian fleet. They were stationed in the Krec and Enikale fortresses. August 3, 1779, the Albanian battalion was renamed to the Greek Battalion, and this led to the schism and reforming of the battalion in April 1795. An array of reconfigurations of Albanian soldiers followed, until the final disbanding of the Albanian Ballaclava battalion in 1859. Alternatively, they were also called the 'Greek Battalion' at many points. In its total history, the units had served in the Russo-Turkish wars of 1768-1774, 1787-1792, 1806-1812, and in the Crimean War. There is also a widespread legend of an 'amazon unit' consisting of the sisters, daughters, and spouses of the Albanian militants of the Ballaclava Battalion. They were described as \\"dressed in Albanian costumes, embroidered with gold and purloins, with ornamented gold and feather on the head, with faces that radiate indescribable grace.\\"  See also  * Albanians in Ukraine * Albanians in Russia * Albania‚ÄìRussia relations  References  Military units and formations of the Russian Empire Albania‚ÄìRussia relations Military units and formations established in 1775 Military units and formations disestablished in 1859 ","title":"Albanian Battalion"},{"id":"54274909","text":"Broadway After Midnight, also known as Gangsters on Broadway, is a 1927 American silent crime melodrama film directed by Fred Windemere and written by Frederic Bartel and Adele Buffington.

Hechuan, Chongqing, China. The Siege of Diaoyu Castle was a battle between Song dynasty China and the Mongol Empire in the year 1259.History of Yuan vol.3 It occurred at the Diaoyu Fortress in modern-day Hechuan district, Chongqing. M√∂ngke Khan, the fourth khan of the Mongol Empire, lost his life in this battle, making it the only battle where the Mongols lost their khan during their campaigns of conquest. This battle was preceded by the Siege of Baghdad in 1258. The siege of Diaoyucheng was a setback for the Mongol conquest.  Background  The Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan conquered vast lands and subjugated nations. Genghis Khan's last battle was fought in Western Xia but his life had come to an end before he was able to conquer it. His successors carried on his ambition. In the year 1234, the Mongols conquered the Great Jin with the assistance of the Song dynasty.History of Jin.vol.18 In the same year, Song China attempted to take back its northern territories originally occupied by the Jin. In September 1234, the Mongols responded with the siege of Luoyang. The Song army holding Luoyang was short of food supplies. Additionally, the Mongols led the water of Yellow River into the city causing great casualties among the Song army.Songshi Jishi Ben mo(ÂÆãÂè≤Á¥Ä‰∫ãÊú¨Êú´).vol.24 The fall of Luoyang was simply a prologue of a series of upcoming battles which lasted decades. The Mongols blamed the Song for \\"breaking the alliance\\". However, it was more of an excuse for further Mongol expeditions.  In Sichuan  After 1234, the Mongols launched an all-out war against the Song dynasty. They attacked from both the east and west flanks, crippling the Chinese defenses. Despite these initial military successes, the Song army managed to retaliate. No significant advancement was made. Under the command of Meng Gong, Yu Jie, and other generals, the Song army fended off the advancing Mongols. In Sichuan, Meng Gong led the Song army as it held its position against the Mongols in 1239 and 1240.  Defense by Yu Jie In 1243, Yu Jie was appointed the commander of the Song army in Sichuan. When he actually came to Sichuan, he discovered that, due to the Mongol invasion, the Sichuan region was in a state of anarchy. The Song army was able to defend itself by forming smaller military units that did not have superiority over each other. In order to reverse the dire situation in Sichuan, Yu sought the advice of the people under his command. Ran Lian and Ran Pu, two hermits of Bozhou, came to his office and offered him the plan of building a castle in Hechuan. Specifically, the plan was to build a castle on Diaoyu mountain of Hechuan. Hechuan sits at the eastern entrance of Sichuan region, the Mongols had to pass it before advancing further into the interior of Sichuan. Thus, the Diaoyu mountain was a great defensive vantage point for the Song army. Yu Jie ordered the construction of dozens of castles in different counties and made these castles the administrative centre of local government. All the castles that were built were situated on the tops of mountains which made them extremely formidable against any offensive. Diaoyu Castle was built in March 1243 and became the administrative center of Hechuan county. Meanwhile, the Mongols began to cultivate lands in occupied territories in Sichuan. This action distressed the Song army since they would not be able to recover these lost territories once the Mongols acquired a permanent source of food and supplies.  Offensive by M√∂ngke  The long-term standoff between Song and Mongols lasted till 1258. After receiving the news of Hulagu reporting the demise of Baghdad and its Khalifa, M√∂ngke Khan decided to break the standoff by leading a large army into Sichuan himself. He also ordered his younger brother Kublai to march towards Hangzhou, the capital of Song. The offensive consisted of three waves of armies. M√∂ngke led his troop across Dasan Pass and entered the city of Hanzhong while the other two waves of advancing forces made their way to Micang pass and Mianzhou. The resistance of the Song army in Sichuan was ineffective. By the spring of 1259, M√∂ngke reached the city of Hechuan. In order to take Hechuan, the Mongols had to capture Diaoyu Castle.  Siege of Diaoyu Castle  M√∂ngke's siege of Diaoyu Castle began sometime between 24 February and 25 March 1259. The siege lasted for approximately five months. The commander of the Song forces in the castle was Wang Jian. M√∂ngke sent his general Wang Dechen as the vanguard of the Mongol army. The Mongols initially tried to break the castle's gates. When this strategy was proven ineffective, they started night raids on the outer part of the castle on minor defensive structures. Although these raids surprised the Song army at first, the Mongols were not able to break into the castle. During these attempts, Wang Dechen was killed by a Song mangonel.History of Yuan.vol.155 In the seventh month of the first year of Kaiqing, M√∂ngke was giving up the original plan of capturing the castle and instead, to dispatch his remaining forces to attack Chongqing, however, Diaoyu Fortress would soon prove to be his place of demise, as M√∂ngke died during the siege. Sources differ on how M√∂ngke actually died‚ÄîChinese sources claim that M√∂ngke was mortally injured by artillery fire from either a shell or stone projectile from a cannon shot or trebuchet, or a bolt from a crossbow arrow (this claim is corroborated by the writings of the Syriac monk Bar Hebraeus), while Persian sources suggest that M√∂ngke died from infectious diseases like dysentery or cholera (Chinese sources confirm the existence of an outbreak during the siege). After receiving the news that his brother died, Kublai decided to withdraw his troops. He threatened the Song that he would attack Lin'an, the capital of Song, to deter any possible retaliation by the Song armies.Tang P.24 His strategy proved effective. The prime minister of Song Jia Sidao soon sent his ambassador to negotiate a peace treaty. Diaoyu Castle remained in the hands of Song armies. Mongols under Kublai tried to take it in 1263 but failed again. In the following decade, the Mongols routinely returned to the castle every autumn.Tang p.49 In 1279, the garrison of Diaoyu Castle surrendered to the Mongols two months before the end of the Song dynasty.Tang p.46  Aftermath  From 1246 to 1279, the Chinese resistance to Mongol conquest in the region of Sichuan lasted 36 years. The unexpected stubborn defense of the Chinese garrison in Diaoyu Castle caused the Mongols much trouble, such as the Mongol defeat in Egypt as a result of Hulagu's sudden retreat after the death of M√∂ngke. The death of M√∂ngke led to the division of the Mongol Empire. Hulagu remained in Persia permanently while Kublai and Ariq B√∂ke tried to seize the title of Khan for themselves. The Song dynasty was temporarily rescued from the brink of destruction. However, Kublai eventually marked the end of Song dynasty in the year of 1279, 20 years after the siege of Diaoyu Castle. Both events were irreversible and had great significance in Chinese, Mongolian, and world history.

Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Manufactured by Mack Rides, it officially opened on 22 September 2017, being promoted as the longest, fastest, and tallest hypercoaster in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the first new attraction added to Warner Bros. Movie World since Doomsday Destroyer in 2016 and the first new roller coaster added since Green Lantern Coaster opened in 2011. The roller coaster reaches a height of with a maximum speed of and has a total track length of 1,400 metres (4,593.2 ft).  History  In September 2016, crates from Mack Rides began to appear on groundwork that was ongoing in the park. In March 2017, construction blueprints were published about the roller coasters layout and station, and construction began in April. In late-May 2017, the park sent out email teasers to its guests indicating a new ride was going to be announced with varying quotes alongside a 3D rendered track. In the forthcoming weeks on 4 June 2017, the park formally announced the roller coaster as \\"DC Rivals HyperCoaster\\" which was initially scheduled to be opened in October 2017 and would be themed to the DC Universe. In July 2017, it was reported that the ride cost the park $30 million dollars to build. On 4 August 2017, the final piece of track was put into place, with testing beginning later on 19 August. On 11 September 2017, Warner Bros. Movie World launched advertisements for the ride, one in the form of an online website about the ride's statistics and another in the form of a television ad centered around the DC Universes characters. Around this time, it was initially detailed by the Gold Coast Bulletin that the official ride opening would be launched after 21 September 2017 during a VIP event. On 16 September 2017, the ride soft-opened to the public for technical rehearsals, while the ride officially opened on the 22 September 2017. Shortly thereafter, in October 2017 Warner Bros. Movie World reported that the ride had made 6.9 million impressions through media coverage and 9.3 million impressions through social media. In addition, the opening day brought in 11,500 visitors to the park as a whole. During annual maintenance of the roller coaster in August 2018, track was replaced on the camel back element to make the ride smoother.  Ride experience  = Queue = DC Rivals HyperCoaster has two main queues: One is a general admission queue for guests who do not own a pass and a Fast Track queue for those who have purchased to bypass queues for the major attractions at the park. Upon entering the station riders, depending on their rider status, can choose from either four queues: general admission, backwards, Fast Track, or single riders. = Layout = DC Rivals HyperCoaster's non-inverting loop After the train dispatches from the station, it takes a right turn into the lift hill. After reaching its maximum height, riders take a twist down the 85-degree-drop. At the bottom, the ride reaches its maximum speed of . Then, the train ascends the ride's tallest camel back hill before descending left to follow into the non-inverting loop. Next, the train goes through a Stengel dive to the right before entering its left bank turning the train's direction back towards the station and then entering a series of twisted camel back hills. Following, the train enters a 480-degree- helix, then exits into a series of S-bend curves. Subsequently, the train rises and dips into two bunny hops before descending left towards a third bunny hill and into the final brake run leading riders back into the station after a right hand turn.  Characteristics  = Trains = Each train has six cars with riders arranged in two across in a two rows. The last car of the train has one row facing backwards with two across in a single row, therefore each train seats 22 passengers. Each of the ride's two trains are themed to the Batmobile.  Reception  DC Rivals HyperCoaster was acclaimed for its long, forceful layout and smooth ride experience. Finder.com.au Chris Stead cited the roller coaster as Warner Bros. Movie World's highlight attraction. OurWorlds Ben Roache noted the ride had abundant air time and that its non- inverting loop was comfortable and well-paced; he called DC Rivals HyperCoaster Australia's best roller coaster and said that the forceful layout borrowed and improved on elements from some of the world's best coasters.

Texas A&M; University. Retrieved on 11 June 2017. R. grandis is a specialist predator on the larvae of the great spruce bark beetle (Dendroctonus micans), a pest of spruce trees (Picea), and is found in Eurasian forests where its prey is found. R. grandis spends its whole life in association with its prey, living underneath the bark of spruce trees. It is specifically attracted by volatile chemicals, monoterpenes, present in the frass produced by the bark beetle larvae as they tunnel under the bark of their host tree. During the twentieth century, D. micans has been steadily increasing its range, and R. grandis has tended to follow. The effects of the predator were apparent when both spread into Germany around the beginning of the century, and after D. micans had invaded Georgia in the 1950s, the first programme for its biological control involving R. grandis was established there in 1963. Since then, rearing of the predatory beetle has been undertaken in Georgia, using cut logs infested with D. micans. When the pest species spread into Turkey, further biocontrol programmes were implemented in that country. It has been found that R. grandis is also attracted to the frass produced by the black turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus terebrans) and the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis), closely related bark boring beetles found in the United States. The larvae of D. frontalis are not gregarious, but those of D. terebrans are, and biological control of the latter pest by R. grandis may be possible. An attempt to do this was made when small numbers of the predator were imported from Belgium and released in Louisiana in 1988.

Both nations are members of the Association of Spanish Language Academies and the Organization of Ibero-American States. History =Spanish colonization= Bolivia and Spain share a long history since the arrival of the first Spanish conquistadores led by Francisco Pizarro in 1532. By 1534, Pizarro managed to overcome the Incan Empire (which was in present- day Bolivia, Peru, Chile and Ecuador) and claimed the territory for Spain.Pizarro Executes Last Inca Emperor In 1542, the Viceroyalty of Peru was created and the territory of Bolivia (known at the time as Upper Peru) was governed from its capital in LimaViceroyalty of Peru but administered locally by the Real Audiencia of Charcas in present-day Sucre.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Bolivia In 1545, Spain founded the city of Potos√≠, next to Cerro Rico which provided vast quantities of silver for the Spanish Empire and was worked by the local Indigenous people. In 1776, Upper Peru was governed by the newly created Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata with its capital in Buenos Aires. In the early 1780s, local indigenous people from the highlands took part in widespread uprisings, most notably the revolt of Rebellion of T√∫pac Amaru II. The rebels hoped to restore the Inca Empire, however, the revolts were defeated by Spanish forces. =Independence= Declaration of Bolivian Independence By 1809, the idea of independence spread through Upper Peru as in several other nations throughout Spanish America. In May 1810, a revolution occurred in Buenos Aires which controlled the territory of Upper Peru and led to the Argentine War of Independence led by General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. This led to the creation of a guerrilla warfare in 1811 in Upper Peru known as the War of the Republiquetas. The guerrilla fighters were eventually defeated by royalist forces. In 1822, troops belonging to Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and Antonio Jos√© de Sucre entered Peru and defeated the Spanish forces in the country. Soon afterwards, troops led by Antonio Jos√© de Sucre entered Upper Peru and fought against royalist forces. By 1825, Upper Peru was free from Spanish authority. Originally, Bol√≠var wanted Upper Peru to join either Peru or Argentina, however, the people of Upper Peru convinced Bol√≠var and Sucre to give autonomy to the territory and on 6 August 1825, an Upper Peruvian congress declared the country independent and renamed the territory \\"Bolivia\\" in honor of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and named its capital \\"Sucre\\" in honor of Antonio Jos√© de Sucre. =Post independence= In July 1847, Bolivia and Spain signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship thus establishing diplomatic relations between both nations. In 1866, Bolivia declared war against Spain during the Chincha Islands War which also involved Peru, Chile and Ecuador.Ruptura y Reconciliaci√≥n: Espa√±a y el Reconocimiento de las Independecias Latinoamericanas (in Spanish) During the Spanish Civil War, Bolivian diplomatic missions in Spain offered asylum to over 300 Spanish citizens and issued visas and safe conduct documents to Spanish nationals to flee to France or to Bolivia.Diplom√°ticos Bolivianos demostrando desprendimiento americano (Julio- Diciembre de 1936) (in Spanish) Bolivia maintained diplomatic relations with Spain throughout General Francisco Franco's administration. In the early 1950s, Antonio Garc√≠a Bar√≥n, a member of the Durruti Column and survivor of Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp arrived to Bolivia where he moved to the Bolivian jungle and set up an anarchist community.Meeting Spain's last anarchist In May 1987, Spanish King Juan Carlos I paid his first official visit to Bolivia, his first of three visits to the country.La visita de los Reyes a Bolivia, un respaldo a la fr√°gil democracia del pa√≠s andino (in Spanish) In 2006, Evo Morales became President of Bolivia. Relations between both nations have been minimal during the President Morales administration. In May 2012, President Morales nationalized Spanish company Red El√©ctrica de Espa√±a, an electrical grid company operating in Bolivia and in December 2012, President Morales also nationalized Spanish electrical company Iberdrola.Bolivia nationalizes Iberdrola electricity companies In February 2013, President Morales nationalized the Spanish infrastructure company, Abertis which led to heightened diplomatic tension between Bolivia and Spain.Espa√±a revisar√° su relaci√≥n con Bolivia tras la nacionalizaci√≥n de la filial de Aena (in Spanish) In July 2013, on his way back to Bolivia from a visit in Russia, President Morales' plane was forced to land in Austria after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange leaked false information that whistleblower Edward Snowden was on board President Morales' airplane to Bolivia.European states were told Snowden was on Morales plane, says Spain Spain, France and Italy had denied for President Morales to fly in their airspace, which was why the President's airplane was forced to land in Austria. After a thorough search of the plane, it was concluded that Edward Snowden was not on board. =2019 Bolivian political crisis= During the 2019 Bolivian general election, the Organization of American States conducted an audit that found \\"clear manipulation\\" in the election and significant irregularities overseen by the Electoral Commission. Following protests, President Morales agreed to hold fresh elections on 10 November 2019; however, soon afterwards President Morales and his vice president, √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera, resigned from office after losing support from the police and military. Both men boarded a Mexican Air Force and were granted asylum in Mexico. Soon afterwards, the Mexican embassy in La Paz opened its ambassador's residence to various former associates of Evo Morales, and this has led to protests from angry Bolivians who oppose the ex-president.Why is Bolivia expelling foreign diplomats? In December 2019, two Spanish diplomats paid a courtesy visit to the Mexican Ambassador's residence. The interim Bolivian government viewed the visit as an insult and accused the diplomats of having ulterior \\"hostile\\" motives. On 30 December, Bolivia expelled the two Spanish diplomats from the country, along with the Mexican Ambassador. That same day, the Spanish government of Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez reciprocated the move by expelling two Bolivian diplomats from Spain. Bilateral relations Over the years, both nations have signed numerous agreements such as an Agreement on the Recognition of Academic Degrees (1903); Agreement on Dual-Citizenship (1961); Cultural Agreement (1966); Technical Cooperation (1971); Extradition Treaty (1990); Agreement on the Avoidance of Double-Taxation (1997); Agreement on Adoptions (2001); Agreement on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (2001) and an Air Transportation Agreement (2010). Migration Consulate-General of Bolivia in Barcelona In 2011, approximately 250,000 Bolivian citizens resided in Spain.Bolivia in Motion Most Bolivians left their country of origin to Spain to escape poverty and political instability. In 2011, Bolivian nationals in Spain sent over US$1 billion in remittances to Bolivia.

In design, it was similar to earlier WW1 era tanks. United States Army engineers worked on the design of the tank, with some influence from British designs of the period, and from the earlier war experience. One example was produced. The tank was an early example of a turreted US tank, less usual at the time, with the turret housing the main gun, with the tank also possessing two machine guns for defence. Development The US Army developed the tank with the idea that the US could produce a locally produced tank, and not rely on British or French technology, who were some of the main producers and exporters of tanks at the time. The tank was produced at the Rock Island Arsenal. The biggest problem was the engine, which was meant to provide horsepower of 220 hp at 1,200 rpm, but in fact generated less than that. The engine was later replaced with a 338 hp Liberty 12 engine, and then a later a Packard 8-cylinder. The tank had a semi-spherical mounting for its main gun. One MG was mounted coaxially with the gun, and the second was mounted on a second turret on the top of the main Turret. The shape of the vehicle was basically a box, with a turret on top, with minimal sloping of armour at the front. The tank was very similar to the British Medium D tank. The design had a very similar appearance to the M1919, its biggest difference was the removal of the turret for a fixed gun mount, the 57 mm gun mounted in the semi spherical ball-mount in the front hull. Despite the modifications, the US Army still found the design underpowered after the tests concluded in 1923. It was also considered to have poor maneuverability and was found to be mechanically unreliable. Additionally, it was found to have too confined crew space and was made with bad workmanship. The design was totally rejected in 1924. The cost of the tank for the tests were $82,000, not counting the actual cost of the testing process.Zaloga, Steve, and Henry Morshead. \\"BT Fast Tank: The Red Army's Cavalry Tank 1931-45.\\" London: Osprey, 2016. Specifications The tank featured armour of up to 1 inch of steel. Its top speed was 15 kilometres per hour. The turret housed a main 57mm gun, as well as two machine guns for secondary defence. It weighed 23 tons. History/usage One tank was made, and the tank was tested, but found wanting in regards to the power train. The tank resulted in a further developed tank, the M1922, produced a year later.\\"Weapons medium tank M1922 history of war http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_medium_tank_M1922.html The tank was tested until 1926, after which its whereabouts were not known.

Based on the Callahan's Place book series by author Spider Robinson, the game follows Jake Stonebender, narrator of the books, through six discrete comic science fiction adventures. Taking the role of Jake, the player solves puzzles, converses with characters from the Callahan's Place series and visits locations such as the Amazon rainforest, Transylvania and outer space. Callahan's Crosstime Saloon began development at Legend in 1995, under the direction of Josh Mandel, co- designer of Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist. Mandel had considered adapting the Callahan's Place books since the 1980s, and saw the project as an answer to the dark and violent content of games in the mid-1990s. Robinson was initially uninterested in the game's development, but increasingly collaborated with Mandel as it progressed. First planned as a self-published title, Callahan's Crosstime Saloon switched to publisher Take-Two late in development, and was subsequently mismarketed as a work of Western fiction. The game was a commercial failure, although Mandel was pleased with its reception by fans of Robinson's books. It received positive reviews from critics. Callahan's Crosstime Saloon became Mandel's last project at Legend Entertainment, and was the company's penultimate adventure game, followed by John Saul's Blackstone Chronicles (1998). Gameplay pop-up menu, which offers the verbs \\"look at\\" and \\"talk to\\". An inventory bar appears on the bottom half of the screen, and the fireplace bullseye is visible in the background. The player controls Jake Stonebender (narrator of the book) through a series of bizarre adventures. Included in the game are several songs performed by Spider Robinson himself; these can be heard by talking to the pianist in the bar and asking for \\"one of your specialties\\". Plot Development =Origins= In late 1995, Legend Entertainment secured the rights to develop a comic science fiction adventure game based on the Callahan's Place stories by Spider Robinson, and chose the name Callahan's Crosstime Saloon initially as its working title. The project was led by Josh Mandel, designer of the earlier games Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist and Space Quest 6 by Sierra On-Line. Mandel had first discovered Robinson's work in the early 1980s, when he opened Time Travelers Strictly Cash at an airport. Believing the Callahan's stories to be a good fit for the adventure genre, Mandel considered the idea of adapting them \\"for a decade\\" and pitched the concept to Sierra during his time at the company, where he had begun to work in 1990. However, the idea was not accepted; he later said that Sierra president Ken Williams was \\"strongly committed to establishing Sierra's characters, rather than using licensed properties\\". Mandel's chance to create Callahan's Crosstime Saloon came after his departure from Sierra, which he left during the development of Space Quest 6 because of his distaste for the company's changing corporate culture. He joined Legend Entertainment, a studio known for adapting literary licenses, and proceeded to help with Mission Critical and Shannara. Eventually, the developer appointed him to direct an adventure game based on The Belgariad, but author David Eddings ultimately rejected the company's proposal. Legend co-founders Bob Bates and Mike Verdu then asked Mandel to select two potential authors to adapt, so that the company could begin a new project after the failure of The Belgariad. He chose Robinson and Dean Koontz, his favorites at the time, and Legend opted for the former. Mandel's core goals with Callahan's Crosstime Saloon were to make a title with a \\"strongly positive theme\\", in contrast to other games of the period, and to produce an adventure game that paired the \\"depth and playability\\" of text-based interactive fiction with the visuals and interface of a newer graphic adventure. The optimism of Robinson's work provided the foundation for the former goal. Alongside these objectives, Mandel hoped to top the animation and graphics of Legend's earlier titles, and to capture the adult attitude of Robinson's books. The game was planned from the start to be character-driven; Steve Bauman of Computer Games Strategy Plus reported in 1995 that its central theme was \\"[r]eal people with real problems.\\" According to Mandel, Robinson's short story collections also supplied the basis for the game's episodic structure, a design decision he believed was necessary to capture the Callahan's Place style. He was hesitant to adopt the structure at first, as it was highly unconventional for a computer game. By November 1995, Callahan's Crosstime Saloon was set to include 10 episodes and was planned for a mid-1996 release. The number of episodes had dropped to nine by December. =Production= In adapting the Callahan's Place books for computers, Josh Mandel described feeling \\"a huge responsibility in the temporary custody I had been granted with these characters\\", in part thanks to the \\"terrifying omnipresent knowledge\\" that its protective fans would be critical of a game unfaithful to Spider Robinson's work. The books' audience was small but passionate, and the alt.callahans Usenet newsgroup was in the top 1-2% most popular online at the time, with a membership in excess of 60,000. Despite this concern, Mandel found it creatively freeing to use pre-defined characters and backstories that he could develop in new directions. The game was not based on any particular Callahan's Place work, but rather used the books as a starting point for new stories. According to Mandel, the decision to break from the series' universal setting of Callahan's bar came early: he found it \\"unnecessarily literal\\" to limit the game to a single area, and unrealistic to include puzzles in the bargoers' past-tense flashback sequences. Instead he invented roughly 40 new locations for the episodic stories, populated by between 40 and 50 original characters. The only locations borrowed directly from Robinson's writing were the parking lot, interior and roof of Callahan's bar, which Mandel populated with pre-existing characters from the Callahan's Place books. Author Spider Robinson (pictured in 2004) grew increasingly involved with Callahan's Crosstime Saloon as development progressed. Spider Robinson was initially uninvolved in Callahan's Crosstime Saloon; he requested only that Mike Callahan not be depicted as thin, which an earlier cover artist for the books had done. Robinson did not play computer games or use the Internet, and he later said that he \\"planned to spend the money and ignore the results.\\" This arrangement made Mandel uneasy, as it increased the game's chances of drifting away from Robinson's vision. In response, Mandel later said, \\"[E]arly on in the design process, I began to write or call him, especially when making decisions that affected the history and lives of his characters\\". As development progressed, Robinson's involvement heavily increased, and he began to speak with Mandel between three and four times weekly about the game. Mandel said that Robinson was open and supportive regarding additions to the series, which they discussed early in each section's creation. Only a planned backstory for Doc Webster was removed because of these discussions, as it conflicted with part of the upcoming Callahan's Legacy book. Legend Entertainment was a small development house of only 13 employees when Mandel joined, and the Callahan's Crosstime Saloon team reached 22 members by late 1996. The company did not employ in-house composers or an art staff; audiovisual production was hired out to contractors. As a designer, Mandel called his switch to Legend from Sierra \\"a very difficult transition\\", as he was the only developer at the company who did not know how to program. Game design documents at Legend were written in a \\"pseudocode\\" format rather than in plain text, and the company was unused to working in the style Mandel had used at Sierra. This resulted in communication problems, and Mandel later said, \\"I felt [for a long time] like I was out of my depth, that my smaller range of talents was problematic\\". He had moved to Virginia to join the team, and lived on a farm in the countryside. According to Mandel, the Legend office often held design meetings wherein \\"almost the entire company was invited to review your game design and pick it apart\\" throughout development, whereas Sierra designers were often left to themselves until late in the production cycle. Mandel worked at Legend's main office \\"maybe 10-12 hours a day, 5 or 6 days a week\\" during the first half of development for Callahan's Crosstime Saloon. However, after it came time to focus mostly on its writing, he stayed at home and kept a schedule of \\"about 10am 'til 2 or 3am, 7 days a week\\". Mandel later described the writing period for Callahan's Crosstime Saloon as \\"one of the darkest periods of my life\\", as he was suffering from a deep depression. He worked, ate and slept in a Sky Chair suspended from his living room ceiling, which he left only rarely. He kept a phone nearby, and a series of ropes allowed him to manipulate his garage door without leaving the chair, so that he could let his dog outside. In 2013, Mandel said that Callahan's Crosstime Saloon was at the time \\"the one thing that I had any drive at all to accomplish.\\" While writing the game, Mandel built carefully from the existing books and sought not to introduce inconsistencies with the series' canon. Legend Entertainment displayed Callahan's Crosstime Saloon at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June. Seeing the game at the show, a writer for Computer Games Strategy Plus remarked, \\"We're betting on this one.\\" =Switch to Take-Two and final months= Callahan's Crosstime Saloon was initially set to be self-published by Legend Entertainment, but the company began to transition away from publishing in mid-1996, when it offloaded sections of its business to Random House's RandomSoft branch. By the time of Legend's deal to develop Unreal II in October 1998, Bob Bates said that the company's business strategy had become a \\"transition from [being] a middle-tier publisher to a top-tier developer\\". In September 1996, Legend signed the publishing rights for Callahan's Crosstime Saloon over to Take-Two Interactive, which wanted the project as part of its effort to expand and diversify its portfolio. According to Take-Two, the deal entailed a $500,000 advance payment to Legend, and a guarantee to pay Legend royalties of 25% for each domestic sale and 50% for sales abroad. By October, Callahan's Crosstime Saloon was set for a January 1997 release. Josh Mandel felt that the game was rushed in its final months, and that the team ultimately \\"ran out of time.\\" According to Robinson, Josh Mandel arrived with a beta version of Callahan's Crosstime Saloon before its release, and they played it together for at least eight hours. Robinson highly enjoyed the result. According to Mandel, Callahan's Crosstime Saloon was developed on a small budget, and Legend's situation grew \\"very bleak financially towards the end\\" of the game's creation. Its cost ultimately totaled around $1 million. During his time at the studio, Mandel had to pay for certain aspects of development personally because of fluctuations in company resources. He later noted that the team's relationship with Take-Two was troubled, and that the publisher \\"reneged on contracts and payments\\", among other concerns. In preparation for the game's release, Take-Two incorrectly advertised Callahan's Crosstime Saloon as a work of Western fiction, a mistake that Mandel claimed had occurred \\"because nobody at the company [had] bothered to play it ‚Äî or even ASK what it's about ‚Äî before publishing it.\\" Calling Take-Two \\"the bottom of the barrel of the games industry\\", Mandel also accused the publisher of failing to market Callahan's Crosstime Saloon past January 1997 and of creating substandard packaging for the project. The game ultimately shipped on April 16, 1997, and was launched without a press release from its publisher. According to Mandel, Take-Two mistakenly produced and released the unfinished beta of Callahan's Crosstime Saloon rather its completed gold master, an event he later called the worst moment of his game career. Reception and aftermath According to Spider Robinson, Callahan's Crosstime Saloon was a commercial failure. Discussing its sales performance, he noted that it \\"started out slow... but then it tapered right off.\\" Richard Cobbett of Rock, Paper, Shotgun later wrote that the game \\"slipped instantly into obscurity\\", which he blamed on its marketing effort by Take-Two Interactive. Poor sales meant that no Macintosh version was developed, and Robinson, a Macintosh user, subsequently never played Callahan's Crosstime Saloon after its release. However, Josh Mandel was pleased with the game's reception by fans of the Callahan's Place books. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Callahan's Crosstime Saloon the 66th-best adventure game ever released. Reviewing Callahan's Crosstime Saloon for Computer Gaming World, Charles Ardai called it \\"a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful game\\" that \\"left me with one of the biggest damn smiles a computer game has ever put on my face.\\" Morgana of Computer Games Strategy Plus wrote, \\"For me, and others like me who value playability, story, and intelligence above ocular diabetes, Callahan's is a find.\\" In PC Gamer US, T. Liam McDonald remarked that the game's humor is inconsistent, but that \\"in the final tally the funny and unfunny are balanced enough to keep things entertaining.\\" He summarized the game as \\"a winner.\\" Shane Mooney of Computer Game Entertainment found the game easy and its puzzles somewhat arbitrary, noting that the developers did not \\"seamlessly integrate them into the game's tapestry.\\" However, he concluded, \\"For those who prefer to be entertained over challenged, this is the funniest adventure game of this year.\\" Following the release of Callahan's Crosstime Saloon, Josh Mandel quit Legend Entertainment. He later said that he had become \\"extremely depressed about\\" Take-Two's handling of the game, and felt that his lack of coding knowledge would make him a \\"financial drain\\" at the small and troubled Legend, as he did not expect to receive another designer position for some time. Instead, he became a freelancer and worked for other companies on games such as Jagged Alliance 2, Crash of the Titans, Insecticide and Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded. In 1998, Legend proceeded to release its final adventure game, John Saul's Blackstone Chronicles. Thereafter, the studio sold to publisher GT Interactive and changed its focus to developing shooter games such as Unreal II: The Awakening and The Wheel of Time. GT was ultimately purchased by Infogrames, which later changed its name to Atari. In January 2004, Atari opted to shutter Legend.

United States, No. 16-402, 585 U.S. ____ (2018), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case concerning the privacy of historical cell site location information (CSLI). The Court held, in a 5‚Äì4 decision authored by Chief Justice Roberts, that the government violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by accessing historical CSLI records containing the physical locations of cellphones without a search warrant. Prior to Carpenter, government entities could obtain cellphone location records by claiming the information was required as part of an investigation. After Carpenter, government entities must obtain a warrant to access that information. The decision declined to extend traditional third party doctrine caselaw‚Äîwhich was largely decided when most Americans relied on landline phones rather than cellphones‚Äîto cover historical CSLI data. Recognizing the fundamental shift that the technological revolution of the 21st century had wrought on human behavior, the Court instead embraced an expanded vision of individual constitutional rights in this type of data. However, the Court's ruling was very narrow and did not otherwise change the third-party doctrine related to other business records that might incidentally reveal location information, nor overrule prior decisions concerning conventional surveillance techniques and tools such as security cameras. The Court did not expand its ruling on other matters related to cellphones not presented in Carpenter, including real-time cell site location information (CSLI) or \\"tower dumps\\" (a download of information about all the devices that connected to a particular cell site during a particular interval). The opinion also did not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security. Background =Legal and technical background= Cell site location information (CSLI) Third-party wireless service providers (such as AT&T;, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon) are able to find the location of cell phones through either global positioning system (GPS) data or cell site location information (CSLI). CSLI is cell phone information captured by nearby cell towers; and this information is able to triangulate, or pinpoint, the location of cell phones. Third-party service providers capture and store this data for business purposes, such as troubleshooting, maximizing network efficiencies and to determining whether to charge customers roaming fees for particular calls. The data can also provide the historical movements of a cellphone. Thus, anyone with access to this data has the ability to know where the phone has been and what other cell phones were in the same area at a given time. Assuming cell phone owners travel with their cellphones, this data can theoretically provide every place a person has traveled and nearly everyone the person met. Comparison between an order for disclosure and a search warrant In Carpenter, the Supreme Court determined what type of legal authorization is required by a government entity to compel third-party wireless service providers to turn over historical records containing the physical locations of cellphones. Attorneys for Carpenter argued that the authorization should be a search warrant. Attorneys for the United States argued that the authorization should be a court order for disclosure. Requirements to obtain an \\"order for disclosure\\" are less stringent than the requirements to obtain a warrant. *Court order for disclosure: An order for disclosure is a type of court order typically instructing a third party to turn over information in its possession related to an investigation.Oliver, Nancy K. \\"Location, Location, Location: Balancing Crime Fighting Needs and Privacy Rights.\\" U. Balt. L. Rev. 42 (2012): 485, 490-491 To obtain an order for disclosure from a court, a governmental entity must provide specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. Government entities are not required to show probable cause to obtain an order for disclosure.18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2703(d) *Search warrant: Under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, people have the right to be free from unreasonable searches of their \\"persons, houses, papers, and effects\\" unless the government entity obtains a search warrant. To obtain a search warrant, the government entity must show probable cause. Probable cause to search exists when facts and circumstances known to the government entity provide the basis for a reasonable person to believe that a crime was committed and the items to be searched are relevant to the crime. Third- party doctrine Prior to Carpenter, the Supreme Court consistently held that a person had no legitimate expectation of privacy in regard to information voluntarily turned over to third parties, and therefore a search warrant was not required to obtain this information. This legal theory is known as the third-party doctrine, established by the Supreme Court cases United States v. Miller (1976), which determined that bank records were not subject to expectation of privacy, and Smith v. Maryland (1979), which determined the rights of individuals with regard to phone communications In particular, Smith was a landmark decision by the Court and has guided the federal courts ever since on questions related to privacy and phones. The Court held in Smith that the government may not eavesdrop on a phone call, even one placed from a public phone booth; however, the phone numbers the person dialed on his phone could be obtained without a warrant. The Court also determined that the Fourth Amendment does not protect the public from the government obtaining information necessary to get communications from point A to point B. For example, without a warrant the government could obtain from a letter or package the sender, receiver, originating and delivery addresses, package size, and weight; however, the government was required to obtain a warrant before opening the package or letter to obtain its contents. The Stored Communications Act In 1986, the United States Congress passed the Stored Communications Act (codified at 18 USC Chapter 121 ¬ß¬ß 2701‚Äì2712), which governs the privacy of stored Internet communications in the United States. The Act protects the personal information that is stored by certain providers, such as electronic communication and remote computing service providers. It prohibits these service providers \\"from knowingly disclosing the contents of customers‚Äô electronic communications or subscriber records\\", but \\"a provider is required to disclose the information to a U.S. government agent or agency,\\" if they obtain a warrant first. Section 2703 (18 USC ¬ß 2703) provides the rules that the government must follow in order to compel a third-party service provider to disclose \\"customer or subscriber\\" content and non-content information.Kerr, Orin S. \\"A User's Guide to the Stored Communications Act, and a Legislator's Guide to Amending it.\\" Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 72 (2003): 1208 Prior to passage of the Stored Communications Act, many courts were reluctant to issue orders for disclosure that allowed the government to obtain data held by third parties; but section (d) of this act required a judge to issue a court order for disclosure whenever the federal government showed that the requested information was relevant to a criminal investigation. Public adoption of smartphone technology In the 2010s, cellphones, particularly smartphones, had become an important instrument for nearly every person in the United States. By 2016, over 95% of Americans owned a cellphone. Many applications, such as GPS navigation and location tools, required the cellphone to send and receive information constantly, including the exact location of the cellphone. As technology advanced in the 21st century, the Court began to back away from its 20th century third-party doctrine. In 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Riley v. California that the warrantless search and seizure of digital contents of a cellphone during an arrest is unconstitutional. In its decision, the Court recognized that the public's adoption of cellphones, combined with their capacity to hold vast quantities of detailed personal information, makes them vastly different from the old analog phones. In 2012, the Court ruled in United States v. Jones that the government is prohibited from entering private property to attach a GPS tracker to a suspect's car without a valid warrant. Foreshadowing Carpenter, Justice Sotomayor used her concurrence in Jones to express her discomfort with the third-party doctrine: > More fundamentally, it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an > individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information > voluntarily disclosed to third parties. This approach is ill suited to the > digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about > themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks. = Facts of the case = Between December 2010 and March 2011, several individuals in the Detroit, Michigan, area conspired and participated in armed robberies at RadioShack and T-Mobile stores in Michigan and Ohio. When the robbers entered the store, they brandished their guns, ordered customers and employees to the back of the store, and told the employees to fill their bags with new smartphones. In April 2011, four of the robbers were captured and arrested. (The petitioner, Timothy Carpenter, was not among the group of arrestees.) One of those arrested confessed and turned over his phone so that FBI agents could review the calls made from his phone around the time of the robberies. Soon afterwards, a magistrate judge, in accordance with the Stored Communications Act, granted the FBI's request to obtain \\"transactional records\\" from various wireless carriers for 16 different phone numbers for \\"[a]ll subscriber information, toll records and call detail records including listed and unlisted numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted to and from [the] target telephones... as well as cell site information for the target telephones at call origination and at call termination for incoming and outgoing calls[.]\\" The government was able to obtain a court order before gaining access to the information; prosecutors only had to show that they were seeking evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. Getting a search warrant requires the government to prove probable cause which is harder to obtain because it requires more specific information. The 16 different phone numbers called or received by the confessed robber around the time of the robberies were not sufficient evidence to establish probable cause; however, it was sufficient evidence under the Stored Communications Act, which requires only \\"that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\\" From the historical cell-site records, which the government tracked Carpenter's location (CSLI) for 127 days the government was able to determine that Carpenter's cellphone communicated with cell towers at the time and from this information, the government was able to determine that Carpenter was within a two-mile radius of four robberies. Using this information, the government charged and arrested Carpenter. A jury later convicted Carpenter on several counts of aiding and abetting a robbery that affected interstate commerce and another count of aiding and abetting the use or carriage of a firearm during a federal crime of violence. Carpenter was sentenced by Judge Sean Cox of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to 1395 months, or 116.25 years, in federal prison. = Appeal before the Sixth Circuit = Carpenter appealed his conviction and sentence to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. A three-judge panel heard the case on October 14, 2015. On April 13, 2016, Judge Raymond Kethledge delivered the opinion of the Court, affirming Carpenter's conviction and sentence. The Sixth Circuit relied on the Supreme Court's guidance from the Supreme Court's 1979 decision in Smith v. Maryland to clarify that only the content of a person's communication is protected by the Fourth Amendment. The Court explained that \\"cell-site data ‚Äî like mailing addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses ‚Äî are information that facilitate personal communications, rather than part of the content of those communications themselves.\\" Furthermore, the Court determined that the government obtained information from not Carpenter but the service provider's business records. Therefore, the government's collection of the service provider's business records did not constitute a \\"search\\" of Carpenter under the Fourth Amendment and so did not require a warrant. Judge Jane Branstetter Stranch dissented from the majority's conclusion that the collection of the service provider's business records did not constitute a search. In her dissent, Judge Stranch states, \\"this case involves tracking physical location through cell towers and a personal phone, a device routinely carried on the individual's person; it also involves the compelled provision of records that reflect such tracking. In light of the personal tracking concerns articulated in our precedent, I am not convinced that the situation before us can be addressed appropriately with a test primarily used to obtain business records such as credit card purchases ‚Äî records that do not necessarily reflect personal location. And it seems to me that the business records test is ill suited to address the issues regarding personal location that are before us.\\" Supreme Court = Grant of certiorari and oral argument = The Supreme Court Justices presiding over the Carpenter case. Front row (left to right): Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, John Roberts (Chief Justice), Clarence Thomas, and Stephen Breyer. Back row (left to right): Elena Kagan, Samuel A.

On June 5, 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to review the case when it granted Carpenter's petition for writ of certiorari. Twenty amicus curiae briefs were filed by organizations, scholars, and corporations in this case. The Supreme Court heard Oral arguments on November 29, 2017. Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney with the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, argued on behalf of Carpenter.

While the Court reviewed the case, some considered Carpenter to be the most important Fourth Amendment case before the Supreme Court in a generation. =Opinion of the Court= The Court issued its decision on June 22, 2018, with the court split 5‚Äì4. Chief Justice Roberts wrote the majority opinion. Associate Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined Roberts' opinion. The Court's decision recognized that the case stood at the intersection of two branches of caselaw. The first branch stems from United States v. Jones, where several concurring Justices indicated that long-term GPS tracking could constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment as a violation of a person's reasonable expectation of privacy, though the case was ultimately decided on the grounds of physical trespass. The second branch of caselaw stems from Smith v. Maryland and United States v. Miller, where the Court held‚Äîpursuant to the third-party doctrine‚Äîthat government entities did not need a warrant under the Fourth Amendment to access pen register data and bank records, respectively, which were voluntarily disclosed to third parties. Ultimately, the Carpenter majority determined that the third-party doctrine applied in Smith v. Maryland and United States v. Miller could not be extended to historical CSLI. Instead, the Court likened \\"detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled\\" historical CSLI records to the GPS information at issue in United States v. Jones, recognizing that both forms of data accord the government the ability to track individuals' past movements. Further, the Court noted that CSLI could pose even greater privacy risks than GPS data, as the prevalence of cellphones could accord the government \\"near perfect surveillance\\" of an individual's movements. Accordingly, the Court ruled that, under the Fourth Amendment, the government must obtain a warrant in order to access historical CSLI records. In issuing this landmark decision, Chief Justice Roberts argued that technology \\"has afforded law enforcement a powerful new tool to carry out its important responsibilities. At the same time, this tool risks Government encroachment of the sort the Framers [of the US Constitution], after consulting the lessons of history, drafted the Fourth Amendment to prevent.\\" The majority adds, > [S]eismic shifts in digital technology [] made possible the tracking of not > only Carpenter's location but also everyone else's, not for a short period > but for years and years. Sprint Corporation and its competitors are not your > typical witnesses. Unlike the nosy neighbor who keeps an eye on comings and > goings, they are ever alert, and their memory is nearly infallible. There is > a world of difference between the limited types of personal information > addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive chronicle of location > information casually collected by wireless carriers today. However, Chief Justice Roberts stressed that the decision was a very narrow one and did not affect other parts of the third-party doctrine, such as banking records. Similarly, he noted that the decision did not prevent the collection of CSLI without a warrant in cases of emergency or for issues of national security. =Dissents= Justices Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch each wrote dissenting opinions. Kennedy's dissent cautioned against the limitation on law enforcement, writing, > This case involves new technology, but the Court's stark departure from > relevant Fourth Amendment precedents and principles is, in my submission, > unnecessary and incorrect, requiring this respectful dissent. The new rule > the Court seems to formulate puts needed, reasonable, accepted, lawful, and > congressionally authorized criminal investigations at serious risk in > serious cases, often when law enforcement seeks to prevent the threat of > violent crimes. And it places undue restrictions on the lawful and necessary > enforcement powers exercised not only by the Federal Government, but also by > law enforcement in every State and locality throughout the Nation. Adherence > to this Court's longstanding precedents and analytic framework would have > been the proper and prudent way to resolve this case. Alito wrote in his dissent, > I share the Court's concern about the effect of new technology on personal > privacy, but I fear that today's decision will do far more harm than good. > The Court's reasoning fractures two fundamental pillars of Fourth Amendment > law, and in doing so, it guarantees a blizzard of litigation while > threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which > law enforcement has rightfully come to rely. Although Gorsuch also wrote a dissent, his opinion is similar to a concurring opinion because he agreed with the majority's decision but disagreed with the majority's reasoning. Gorsuch agreed that law enforcement agencies need a warrant to obtain cell phone data; however, he disagreed that the Fourth Amendment provides the right to a \\"reasonable expectation of privacy.\\" Instead, Gorsuch argues that cell phone location records are the property of cell phone owners, and, under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement agencies cannot search a person's property without a warrant. In 1967, the Supreme Court first suggested in Katz v. United States that the Fourth Amendment provides the right to a \\"reasonable expectation of privacy.\\" Gorsuch believes Katz was incorrectly decided because the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment does not provide for a \\"reasonable expectation of privacy.\\" Instead, Gorsuch writes that the Fourth Amendment \\"grants you the right to invoke its guarantees whenever one of your protected things (your person, your house, your papers, or your effects) is unreasonably searched or seized. Period.\\" Thus, he argues that historical cell record data is the property of cell phone owners and cannot be searched without a warrant. Gorsuch also advocates that the Court should overturn the \\"reasonable expectation of privacy\\" doctrine suggested in Katz, as well as the \\"third-party doctrine\\" established in Smith and Miller because they are not consistent with the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment and lead to confusion and inconsistencies in the lower courts. Subsequent developments Carpenter's case was reheard by the Sixth Circuit, who still ruled against Carpenter and sentenced him to 116 years in prison in June 2019. While Carpenter's lawyers argued that the cell phone tracking data should have been subject to the exclusionary rule and thrown out as material collected without a proper warrant under the Supreme Court's ruling, the judges believed that the FBI was acting in good faith with respect to collecting the data based on the law at the time the crimes were committed, and thus still allowed that evidence to be used against Carpenter. The Supreme Court has previously ruled in 2011 that such good faith exemptions to the exclusionary rule are permissible in Davis v. United States.  See also  =Cases= * Riley v.

D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 203, 214 Rufus is best known as a mentor to Pliny the Younger. In several letters Pliny writes warmly of Rufus, noting that he often sought his advice, recounting in one that on his deathbed Rufus told his daughter, \\"Through the benefit of a longer life I have gained many friends for you, but above all Secundus [Pliny the Younger] and Cornutus.\\"Pliny, Epistulae, IV.17.9  Life  Because Pliny tells us Corellius Rufus died at the age of 67, we can estimate the year of his birth as AD 30/31.Pliny, Epistulae, I.12.11; this letter is usually dated to AD 97-8. We know little of his life before he became suffect consul. The only incident recorded is that he contracted gout at the age of 32, which he led Pliny to believe was a hereditary condition. Rufus treated it by dieting and \\"virtuous living\\" in his younger years, but towards his last years the disease worsened, afflicting all of his body and not just his legs.Pliny, Epistulae, I.12.4-6 After his consulate, Rufus served as legatus pro praetor, or governor, of Germania Superior from 79 to 84.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 302-305 Then either due to his illness, or antipathy to Domitian, he withdrew from public life. Pliny makes it clear that Rufus hated the emperor: once, when Pliny visited Rufus, confined to his bed and suffering, the older man confided: \\"Why do you think I endure this dreadful pain for so long? I want to outlive that brigand.\\"Pliny, Epistulae, I.12.8 Pliny was convinced that had Rufus been in better health, he would have participated in Domitian's assassination. Following the death of Domitian, Rufus returned to public life. Pliny habitually sought his advice. During a discussion about young men of promise before the emperor Nerva, several people praised Pliny. Rufus commented that he had to be sparing of his praise of the younger Pliny, \\"because he does nothing without taking my advice.\\"Pliny, Epistulae, IV.17.8 Pliny also records that although he did not seek Rufus' advice prior to undertaking the prosecution of the delator or informer Publicius Certus on the Senate floor, he did tell him about his plans ahead of time.Pliny, Epistulae, IX.13.6 The emperor Nerva appointed Corellius Rufus to a commission tasked with purchasing and allocating land to relieve the condition of the poor. Rufus handled his share of the work aided by one Claudius Pollio.Pliny, Epistulae, VII.31.4 Corellius Rufus, wracked with pain from his gout, committed suicide by starving himself to death, despite the entreaties of his family and friends. Pliny wrote in a letter to Calestrius Tiro that even he could not change the older man's mind on the matter, \\"for his decision to die had hardened more and more inflexibly.\\"Pliny, Epistulae, I.12.10 Pliny ends his letter begging his friend to send him some consolation that is original, \\"for the consolations such as I have heard and read that come to me unbidden, but are unequal to this great grief.\\"Pliny, Epistulae, I.12.13  Family  Rufus was married to Hispulla; her name indicates a connection with an uncommon gens, the Hispo.

Released in 2002, it was directed by Doris D√∂rrie who also wrote the screenplay. Plot Three couples aged around 30, who were close friends when younger, meet for a dinner party. But nothing is as uncomplicated as it used to be and tension is felt from the first moment. Emilia and Felix have recently separated and she has let herself go. She has cut off her hair, wears grungy clothes and her flat is a mess. Though the two never minded not having much money, she admits to an affair with the now-rich Dylan, their host for the evening. Their friends Annette and Boris do not have much money either and their relationship is always edgy, so much so that Boris can never find the right moment to hand over the engagement ring he has bought. The third couple of Charlotte and Dylan are married, and the business Dylan has built up has made him a millionaire. With an ostentatious new house full of designer kitsch and no need to work, Charlotte is deeply unhappy. She feels that their wealth has trapped them both. When their four old friends turn up, the atmosphere is not relaxed and sharp remarks are exchanged. After the meal, Felix suggests replicating an experiment conducted at the university where Emilia works. The other two couples must place bets that once stripped and blindfolded they will be able to pick out their partner by touch alone. Any sound is forbidden and all are sprayed with the same perfume to mask differences in smell. Emilia and Felix, not being a couple, will be referees. When the blindfolds are removed, Annette has been selected by Dylan and his wife Charlotte by Boris. Recriminations follow, ending in insults and blows. Left alone, Dylan tries to placate the hurt and furious Charlotte, ultimately suggesting that the answer to their problems would be a baby. Walking home together, Annette (who fancies Dylan) takes such a philosophical attitude to the mix-up that Boris at last feels able to propose to her with the ring he always carries. Felix sees Emilia to her flat and she tries to go to bed, but he wants to talk about past happy times. In the end, she agrees to strip and play the blindfold game with him.

In the old German Alpine dialect it was also called the Deutscher Berg (\\"German Mountain\\", Slovenian Nem≈°ka gora) or Zinnenwand. Other names are Meni≈°ka gora (M√∂nchsberg) and Rtaƒça.  Location and surrounding area  Wertatscha stands on the main chain of the Karavanks, which marks the border here between Austria (municipality of Ferlach) and Slovenia (municipality of ≈Ωirovnica). To the north the mountain drops in steep, up to 600-metre-high, rock faces into the valley of Bodental above Windisch Bleiberg; the southern side is gentler. To the west the massif of Wertatscha is bounded by the Bleischitz Saddle (1,840 m); below which is the Klagenfurter Hut an important base for an ascent of the mountain. To the northeast the chain continues over the col of Pautzscharte (1,950 m) to the Pautz (Slovenian: Zelenjak, 2,024 m) and the Selenitza. To the east Wertatscha drops down a rock face to the cirque of Suho ru≈°evje. To the southeast lies the mountain hut of Dom na Zelenici, another important starting point, at on the Selenitza Saddle.  Routes to the summit  From the Bielschitza Saddle a discernible path leads to the top in about 2 hours passing across the schrofen covered southwest slopes. The rather longer climb from the Selenitza Saddle over the southern mountainside is partially waymarked. A ravine from the northwest from the Suho-ru≈°evje cirque, climbing grade II, the southeast ar√™te (also II) and the crumbly western ar√™te from the Bielschitza Saddle (III) are much more difficult. The north face of Wertatscha has special significance for alpinism. In 1902 Eduard Pichl succeeded in making the first ascent of this face which has a climbing grade of IV. Today there are many other climbing routes, many at grades IV and V. Historically important was the first ascent of the northwest pinnacle by Kurt Maix in 1925. This was the first time that a grade V climb was achieved in the Karawanks. The east face offer several shorter climbing routes, which were opened in the late 20th century.  Incidents On 21 September 2016 there were rockfalls in the Wertatscha Cirque. The dust cloud reached as far as the Klagenfurter Hut and hiking trails were closed as a precaution.Gef√§hrliche Felsst√ºrze: Sperrgebiet. kleinezeitung.at, Print, 24 September 2016, p.14.

Career He was born the son of Thomas Kemmis of Shaen and Susannah Kemmis of Shaen Castle, now in County Laois, Ireland, formerly known as Queen's County. He sold his interest in the family property to his brother and used the money to purchase an ensigncy in the British Army's 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot. Promoted to lieutenant in June 1777, after sailing to America, he fought in the Saratoga campaign as part of General Henry Powell's brigade of General John Burgoyne's army. Kemmis was captured by American rebel forces and remained a prisoner of war until 1781 when he was exchanged and returned to England. After purchasing a captaincy in 1784 he remained on half-pay until 1790 when he exchanged into the 40th Regiment of Foot and was promoted to brevet major in 1794. Kemmis took part in the Flanders Campaign until the army was evacuated from Bremen in April 1795. He sailed with his regiment to the West Indies where he was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel. After service on the Helder Expedition and the 1801 Egyptian Campaign he did not accompany the 40th to South America but remained in Ireland. Promoted to colonel, Kemmis took command of the 1st Battalion of the 40th, which arrived in Portugal on 1 August 1808 as part of Wellington's corps for service in the Peninsular War. He was mentioned in dispatches following the 1808 Battle of Vimeiro, and also fought at the battles of Roli√ßa and Talavera for which he received the Army Gold Medal with one clasp. Upon his return from the war, having been promoted to Major-General in 1811, Kemmis took up a staff position in Ireland rising to command the Centre District. He retired in 1819 and died one year later in Cheltenham, Gloucester. Personal life Kemmis and his wife had no children; she died on 24 June 1810 in Southampton. Whilst in the army he was not a popular officer, and was accused by one of his juniors of involvement \\"with the wife of a common soldier\\". He was also known for his anti-papist views. However, according to a family tradition of artist George Rowe (1796-1862), Kemmis adopted the daughter of an English soldier in his division who died while serving in the Peninsula War, Seville on the day his daughter was born. The soldier's wife accompanying him in his foreign deployment died on the same day after hearing of her husband's death. Kemmis was to adopt Philippa, together with his sister, who continued to raise her in Cheltenham after Kemmis' death. Philippa was to marry renowned Cheltenham topographical artist and lithographer George Rowe.

See Adventure playground The Adventure playground at the Parish School was started in 2008 with a sand-pile and two cement culverts. The three-acre play-area now contains a zip-line, shade structures, and an expanse of grassy floodplain, with natural features (dirt, grass, sticks), wildlife, and various scavenged construction materials, other recyclables, lumber, pipes, fabric and rope. Children also have access to tools (hammers and nails, hand drills and saws, shovels and post-hole diggers) for building structures out of recycled building materials. Many of these materials are collected from the Building Materials Reuse Warehouse, a part of the City of Houston's Solid Waste Management Department. The Adventure Playground at the Parish School is staffed by playworkers. Research site The Adventure Playground at the Parish School has been the site of several academic studies. These have concerned landscape design and comparisons of injury rates between conventional adult-designed-and-built playgrounds and child-designed-and-built junk playgrounds, or risky playgrounds. For example, comparing injury rates between two playground types, Wood and Leichter-Saxby (2016) found that the location with the fewest incidents was the child-built adventure playground. In a statistical study of risky play at the Parish School, which compared injury rates there to other activities, Leichter-Saxby and Wood (2018) found that play on the school's adventure playground was slightly riskier than snooker and safer than table tennis. Playing on conventional fixed equipment at school recess was riskier than golf, but safer than being at home. Adventure play was safer than play on conventional playground equipment, but each carried an extremely low risk of serious injury.

On 18 April, the regiment returned to the front with the 240th IAD, which had been transferred to the Leningrad Front's 13th Air Army. The 744th became an elite guards unit, the 86th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, on 1 May, for its \\"exemplary fulfillment of combat missions\\" and for \\"displaying courage and heroism\\" in the Siege of Leningrad. From 12 July to 24 August, the entire 240th IAD was withdrawn to the RVGK to reequip with the updated Yakovlev Yak-9 fighter. The 240th IAD was sent back to the front with the Kalinin Front's 3rd Air Army, with the regiment entering combat on 26 August in the Rzhev area. The regiment fought in Battle of Smolensk and the Nevel Offensive until October. On 20 October, the Kalinin Front became the 1st Baltic Front. The regiment was again pulled out of the frontline on 17 October to integrate new pilots into the regiment at Dobovitsy rear airfield, remaining there until 17 April 1944.

From late June, the 86th provided air support for advancing Soviet ground troops during Operation Bagration, the offensive that recaptured Belorussia and eastern Poland. On 10 July, for its actions in assisting the crossing of the Berezina River and the capture of Borisov, the regiment received the honorific \\"Borisov\\". On 23 July, the regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for helping to capture Minsk during the Minsk Offensive early in the month. On 20 September, the regiment left for Saratov to receive new Yakovlev Yak-3 fighters from the city's Aircraft Plant No. 292, returning to the front on 15 October. In the spring of 1945, the regiment fought in the Battle of K√∂nigsberg during the East Prussian Offensive, for which it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 3rd class, on 17 May. On 14 April, the 240th IAD was transferred to the 1st Belorussian Front's 16th Air Army in preparation for the upcoming Berlin Offensive, during which it provided air support for the Soviet advance. The regiment left the active army on 9 May after the surrender of the German forces. During the war, the regiment flew 10,865 sorties, reported shooting down 393 enemy aircraft, and destroyed 40 on the ground for a total of 433 destroyed aircraft. This came at a cost of 120 downed aircraft and 71 pilots killed, divided as follows: 22 in aerial combat, 33 failed to return, 7 in air raids and other non-combat losses, and 9 died in crashes and of wounds.

From April 1960, the regiment was tasked with protecting Soviet airspace, and participated in numerous large-scale exercises. By the 1980s, in event of a war with NATO, plans were made to use the division to blockade the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits. 86th Guards IAP aircraft were nuclear-capable, and according to a different plan, the regiment was to move to bases in Bulgaria and Romania in event of conflict and launch strikes on Turkish airfields with Tactical nuclear weapons from there. It was assumed that after such an attack, the aircraft would land in Bulgaria, and for testing cooperation, exercises were held during the 1980s, during which a squadron of the 684th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment landed in Bulgaria. On 24 October 1989, the 119th IAD were transferred to the VVS Black Sea Fleet in order to evade Conventional Forces in Europe force size restrictions on the Soviet Air Force.

Life Born Ifaremilekun Fagbemi in Joga-Orile, a town in Ilaro, Ogun State, Abass was captured as a slave by a Dahomean slave merchant called Abass during one of the Dahomey-Egba clashes. He was later sold to a certain Brazilian slave dealer called Williams who took Abass to Brazil as a domestic servant and taught him how to read and write in Dutch, English, Spanish and Portuguese languages. He returned to Nigeria on the condition of working with Mr. Williams as a slave trade business partner. Seriki first settled at Ofin, Isale-Eko in the Colony of Lagos before he relocated to Badagry in the 1830s. In collaboration with his European partners and patrons, he built and maintained a 40-room Barracoon, small rooms in which captured slaves were held prior to being sold to European slave merchants and shipped away across the Atlantic, on the Lagoon's shore in Badagry.

Developed under head coach Steve Kerr, it began during their 2014‚Äì15 run that led to an NBA championship. Unlike typical small-ball units, this group of Warriors was versatile enough to defend larger opponents, while also aiming to create mismatches on offense with their shooting and playmaking skills. The lineup featured the Splash Brothers, a three-point shooting backcourt consisting of two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry, and perennial two-way All-Star Klay Thompson. It also featured versatile defender Andre Iguodala on the wing alongside scorer and one-time MVP Kevin Durant, and 2016‚Äì17 Defensive Player of the Year Draymond Green at center. Green's defensive versatility was described as the \\"key\\" that allowed the lineup to be so effective; although his natural position was power forward, he was able to play as an undersized center in lieu of a traditional center who might have been slower or lacked the playmaking and shooting abilities of Green. The lineup originally included Harrison Barnes, who was replaced by former league MVP Durant in 2016‚Äì17, when the group also began to be known as the \\"Hamptons Five\\". The Death Lineup was considered to be indicative of a larger overall trend in the NBA towards \\"positionless\\" basketball, where traditional position assignments and roles have less importance. The Death Lineup ended after the 2018‚Äì19 season, when Durant left the Warriors for the Brooklyn Nets and Iguodala was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies. Origins and first championship In 2014‚Äì15, Golden State won 67 games in the regular season, led by NBA MVP Stephen Curry. The Warriors' starting lineup with the Andrew Bogut at center played 813 minutes together and outscored opponents by 19.6 points per 100 possessions. After falling behind 2‚Äì1 in the 2015 NBA Finals, Warriors coach Steve Kerr inserted Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup in place of Bogut, who had been named to NBA All-Defensive Team in 2015. The change was first suggested by Kerr's special assistant, Nick U'Ren, who was a fan of the lineup because it always seemed to pick up the pace of the game to a faster speed, which the Warriors preferred. The five-man lineup of Iguodala, Curry, Thompson, Green, and Barnes had played together for 102 minutes during the regular season and 62 minutes through the first 18 games of the playoffs. Although the tallest player was only , the unit was also strong defensively. They were all able to switch on defense, spearheaded by Green's ability to guard players taller and heavier than him. The Warriors won 103‚Äì82 in Game 4, and captured the series 4‚Äì2 to win their first championship since 1975. Iguodala was named the Finals MVP, becoming the first player to garner the award without starting every game in the series, as well as the first winner to have not started a game during the regular season. 73-win record It was not until months after it was deployed in the Finals that the Warriors small lineup was referred to as the Death Lineup. Despite the unit's success, the 2015‚Äì16 Warriors continued to start a traditional lineup with Bogut as their center. Golden State won an NBA-record 73 games behind Curry's league-leading 30.1 points per game and an NBA-record 402 three-pointers made in a season. He was named the MVP for the second straight season, becoming the first unanimous winner in league history. During the season, the Death Lineup was generally reserved to finish the first half and the end of games. It was deployed in 37 games, outscoring opponents by 166 points in 172 minutes for an average advantage of 4.5 points per game and 47.0 points per 100 possessions. Despite their regular season success, the Warriors lost the 2016 NBA Finals, becoming the first team to lose a Finals series after being ahead 3‚Äì1. Hamptons Five During the off-season, Golden State signed former league MVP and four-time scoring champion Kevin Durant to replace Harrison Barnes, who had averaged just five points and made only 5 of 32 shots during the last three losses in the Finals. With Durant leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Warriors' opponents in the 2016 Western Conference Finals, the move was seen as a disruption in the competitive balance of the NBA, and the Warriors instantly became title favorites. The move gave the Death Lineup four players who have averaged at least five assists in a season. San Francisco Bay Area journalist Tim Kawakami coined the nickname \\"Hamptons Five\\" for the new group, which included the four players who traveled with team officials to The Hamptons to recruit Durant. Durant was impressed that all four players showed up and respected his play. They convinced Durant that he was wanted even though they had already won a championship and came within a game of winning a second. Curry, asked by Durant why he wanted him to join, assured him that he was focused on winning and not concerned with being the face of the franchise, despite being the two-time defending league MVP. The Warriors won the 2017 NBA Finals 4‚Äì1, and Durant was unanimously voted the Finals MVP. Kerr had used the Death Lineup for just 16 minutes in the series until deploying it for 17 in the Game 5 clincher. Iguodala scored 20 points in 38 minutes after averaging less than 30 minutes in the first four games of the series. Kerr used him in the small-ball lineup in lieu of big men Zaza Pachulia (10 minutes) and JaVale McGee (0). Injuries limited Golden States' use of the Death Lineup in 2017‚Äì18. Opponents had also adapted by rarely leaving their centers in the game against the Warriors' small lineup. Through 49 games, the unit had a -1.2 plus-minus rating. However, it was still considered the team's most potent lineup. In the final 17 games of the regular season, the Warriors were 7‚Äì10 with Curry missing all but one game after an ankle and later a knee injury. Durant, Thompson, Green, and Iguodala each missed four to eight games as well. In total, the group finished the regular season with 127 minutes played together over 28 games, outscoring their opponents by a mundane 22 points. In Game 4 of the conference semifinals in the 2018 playoffs, Kerr started the Hamptons Five with Durant for the first time ever, and they posted a plus-minus of +26 in 18 minutes to lead a 118‚Äì92 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, giving Golden State a 3‚Äì1 lead in the series. After eliminating the Pelicans in five games, the Warriors continued with the starting lineup in the conference finals to build a 2‚Äì1 series lead against the Houston Rockets. Golden State won the series 4‚Äì3, but Iguodala missed the last four games with a bruised leg. The Warriors entered the NBA Finals for the fourth straight time versus their longterm rivals, the Cleveland Cavaliers. They swept the Cavaliers in four games, leading to their third championship in four years. Fifth consecutive Finals In 2018‚Äì19, the Warriors acquired DeMarcus Cousins, who was recovering from a ruptured left Achilles. He gave Golden State a top-flight, true center for the first time under Kerr, and they became the first team in 42 years with a starting lineup of five All-Stars from the previous season. While the Hamptons Five played more (178 minutes in 38 games) than in the previous regular season, Kerr played the lineup of Cousins, Durant, Curry, Thompson and Green more (268 minutes in 21 games) to integrate Cousins into his new team. In Game 1 of the opening round of the 2019 playoffs, Kerr went to the Hamptons Five early, using them to quell a rally by the Los Angeles Clippers. The coach called the lineup \\"the best five-man unit in the league\\". Cousins finished the game with a -17 plus-minus. The Warriors eliminated the Clippers in six games, but Cousins tore his left quadriceps in Game 2, and he was initially thought to be out for the remainder of the postseason. In a sign of respect and with an increased urgency, Kerr opened the following round against Houston by starting the Hamptons Five for the first time in the season. The Rockets featured two of the top one-on-one, pick-and-roll players in James Harden and Chris Paul, and the coach wanted Iguodala's defense in the starting lineup to counter. In Game 2, each member of the lineup scored at least 15 points, the first time for a Warriors starting unit under Kerr, and Golden State jumped to a 2‚Äì0 series lead. Houston countered the Warriors' small unit by playing forward P. J. Tucker at center along with four guards, forming a lineup of five shooters all or shorter, and tied the series 2‚Äì2. In Game 5, Durant suffered a strained right calf and left with 2:05 remaining in the third quarter; he was later ruled out indefinitely. With Curry and Thompson struggling with their shooting, Durant had been their best player in the playoffs, averaging a team- leading 35.4 points entering the game. However, Curry led Golden State to a Game 5 win after scoring 16 of his 25 points after Durant exited. The Warriors captured the series on the road in Game 6, when Thompson scored 21 of his 27 in the first half, and Curry collected all of his 33 points in the second half. In the Western Conference finals, Golden State swept the Portland Trail Blazers 4‚Äì0, with three of the wins including comebacks of 15 points or more. After starting nine consecutive games, Iguodala missed the deciding Game 4 with a sore left calf injury from Game 3. Curry averaged a series career-high 36.5 points, the highest average by a player in a four-game sweep in NBA history. He and Green both had triple-doubles in Game 4, becoming the first teammates in NBA playoff history to achieve the feat in the same game. The Warriors became only the second team to reach five straight NBA Finals, joining the Boston Celtics (1957‚Äì1966). Golden State was down 3‚Äì1 in the 2019 finals to the Toronto Raptors when Durant returned in Game 5. The Hamptons Five started the game, but Durant ruptured his right Achilles tendon in the second quarter. The Warriors lost the series in Game 6, when Thompson tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee. Both Durant and Thompson were expected to miss most, if not all, of the following season. Aftermath After the 2018‚Äì19 season, the free agent Durant announced that he would sign with the Brooklyn Nets, while Thompson agreed to re-sign with Golden State. Eyeing a replacement for Thompson while he recovered from his injury, the Warriors traded Iguodala to the Memphis Grizzlies in order to free salary cap space to acquire All-Star guard D'Angelo Russell in a sign-and-trade package with Brooklyn for Durant. After Durant's and Iguodala's departures, Warriors CEO Joe Lacob announced his intention to eventually retire their numbers. In 2019‚Äì20, the Warriors moved into their new arena, the Chase Center, which includes a hallway featuring drawings of each member of the Hamptons Five. The Warriors sunk to the bottom of the NBA, with a league worst 15‚Äì50 record, in a season that was cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic. A key component was injuries. With Thompson already out, Curry suffered a hand injury in the fourth game of the season, and was ruled out for four months. As for Russell, he was eventually traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for former first- overall draft pick Andrew Wiggins.

The small islet is typified by a small maritime labiate garrigue environment, with germander and prasium shrubs, with the occurrence of the endemic Maltese Pyramidal Orchid as well as endemic coastal communities based on the Maltese Sea-Lavender and the sub-endemic Maltese Crosswort. The rock has an area of approximately . The maximum length of the islet is , and the average width is about . The island is protected by law. ƒ¶alfa Rock is located approximately from the south coast of the Qala municipality. It is part of a geological formation making up the island of Comino, and the upper areas of Qala. The rock is administratively a part of the Qala local council area. The islet appears devoid of human heritage, with no record of habitation. However, a circular fougasse exists on the islet - forming part of the Tal-Qassis ridge defensive system overlooking the channel between Qala and Comino. ƒ¶alfa Rock sits in a secluded shingle beach, with large pebbles and golden sand. A chain of submerged rocks, collectively known as ƒ†ebel tal-ƒ¶alfa lie within of this islet. The rock has acted as a marker in the annual Malta-Gozo-Malta Open Water Swimming Competition.  Origin of name  The origin of the name Tal-ƒ¶alfa is a matter of conjecture. The word 'ƒßalfa' means 'oath' or 'vow' in Maltese. A local legend links with the name of the islet with Dragut, a famous pirate warrior and Ottoman admiral, who swore to seek revenge for his brother‚Äôs death on the island of Gozo. According to this legend, Dragut‚Äôs brother was killed in Gozo while raiding the island in 1544. The famous pirate asked for his brother‚Äôs corpse for burial. The Gozitans refused to turn the body over, and burned it in front of Dragut‚Äôs eyes in a place now occupied by St. John‚Äôs demi-bastion. It is said that when the Turks boarded their galleys to leave Gozo, Dragut went up on a large rock nearby, now known as il-ƒ†ebla tal-ƒ¶alfa (the Vow Rock), where he vowed to come back and wreak his vengeance on the people of Gozo. In 1551, Dragut laid siege to Mdina, but upon remembering his vow, he brought the Mdina siege to an end and sailed off to attack Gozo, taking almost the whole population into slavery. Another legend relates how following a raid on the Maltese islands, Dragut was sailing past the coast of Gozo when he saw a vineyard on this part of the coast. Yearning for some grapes, he asked if any of his sailors would volunteer and swim to the shore for grapes. One of his sons obliged. On his return to the vessel he presented his father with a bunch of grapes, complete with leaves and the roots plucked out of the fertile soil. Dragut had no choice but to sentence his son to death, for it was forbidden for a Muslim to take the roots of a vine. Saddened, Dragut swore he would never eat a grape in his lifetime again, giving the nearby rocky islet its name.  Wildlife  Saltpans near ƒ¶alfa Rock. The islet supports two distinct vegetation communities. The lower region is dominated by the Shrubby Glasswort (Arthrocnemum macrostachyum), with the Olive-leaved Bindweed (Convolvulus oleifolius) being more dominating the central part of the islet. Other important species present in the area include the Maltese Sea-Lavender (Limonium melitensis) and the Sea Carrot (Daucus rupestris), which is sub- endemic to the Maltese Islands, as well as Lampedusa, Lampione and Panarea. The upper region of the islet is colonised extensively by Esparto grass (Lygeum spartum), the Olive-leaved Bindweed, the Pyramidal Orchid (Anacamptis urvilleana), the Maltese Leek (Allium melitense), the Carline Thistle (Carlina involucrata) and two stunted Lentisks (Pistacia lentiscus). The fauna on this islet includes an isolated population of the endemic Wall Lizard (Podarcis filfolensis) and a morph of the endemic Door Snail (Muticaria macrostoma forma oscitans). The faunal species are isolated from the mainland populations and thus have the potential of developing specific traits. Studies of the seabed around ƒ¶alfa Rock indicated the existence of a thick layer of submerged clay on the bedrock, which supports a facies with burrows of the thalassinid shrimp (Upogebia mediterranea). In many places, the biocoenosis of infralittoral algae is intermixed with the Posidonia oceanica meadows, and well sorted fine sands.  Nature conservation  262x262px ƒ¶alfa Rock is on the Maltese Islands Natural Heritage List, and retains the status of an area of ecological importance and is also a special area of conservation. The Planning Authority scheduled ƒ¶alfa Rock as a Level 1 Site of Scientific Importance (ecology), Level 2 Site of Scientific Importance (geomorphology), and a Level 2 Area of Ecological Importance as per Government Notice No. 827/02 in the Government Gazette dated 20 September 2002.

Personal life Ethel Ayres was born in 1874 in Islington, London. Her father was an engineer toolmaker. After leaving school, she worked for the Post Office in the Telegraph Department. She married Frank Sidney Purdie in 1897, and they had two children. Career Ayres Purdie began her suffragist work in 1894 at a trade union protest against the treatment of female telegraphists. The telegraphists contributed to pension funds that they never received, as the women typically left their jobs when they were married. Ayres' protest wanted women to receive a portion of the money. After her marriage, she studied accountancy at the Society of Arts. Ayres Purdie opened her accountancy firm, which she named The Women Taxpayer‚Äôs Agency, in 1908. In 1909, she finally became a member of the London Association of Accountants. In doing so, she became the first female registered accountant in the United Kingdom. Her accountancy firm advertised in many women's papers, including Common Cause, Votes for Women and The Vote. The adverts encouraged women to collect a portion of their income tax, and argued against discrimination particularly from husbands who taxed their wives. Ayres Purdie was the only woman allowed to represent clients in front of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax. In 1912, her accountancy firm was vandalised by suffragettes, who argued that the inclusion of women in the firm's name was discriminatory. Ayres Purdie was the auditor for the Women's Freedom League, in particular she campaigned for more women in the accountancy industry. She was also an organiser of the Women's Tax Resistance League, which encouraged women not to pay taxes on principle, and provided assistance for them when faced with fines and prison sentences for not paying taxes.

It was designed in 1862-8 by the architect Robert Kerr. It is a Grade II listed building. History Greathed Manor, originally called Ford Manor, was designed by Robert Kerr for the Spender-Clay family, and was completed in 1868. The actress Joyce Grenfell was related to the family by marriage and often visited the house. Accounts of her time there are described in her autobiography ‚ÄúJoyce Grenfell Requests the Pleasure‚Äù. In 1904 Herbert Spender- Clay, MP and founder of the 1922 Committee, married Pauline Astor, daughter of the American billionaire William Waldorf Astor. The couple lived at the house until 1937. Greathed Manor was requisitioned by the British Government during both World Wars. In the Great War it became a Hospital for wounded American Army officers. In the Second World War it was used as the Headquarters of a Canadian Armoured Division in the run-up to D-Day. The house was renamed Greathed Manor when the widowed Pauline Spender-Clay built a smaller house in the grounds of the original building, and requested that the new house be called Ford Manor. The original building was then leased by the Country Houses Association, who renamed the house after their Founder, Admiral Greathed. The house is currently leased by Pressbeau Limited, and is being run as a private nursing home. Architecture Kerr was an influential mid-Victorian architect who wrote The Gentleman's House - Or, How To Plan English Residences, From The Parsonage To The Palace, published in 1864. Kerr's influence was greater than his talent; the architectural critic Ian Nairn described Greathed as; \\"over- confident, making no concessions to the landscape or anything else, without any (...) artistic sincerity, an extreme example of a justly neglected type\\". The architectural historian Mark Girouard was no more complimentary, describing the house as \\"appalling\\" and Kerr's most significant work, Bearwood House, as of a \\"design [...] as heavyweight as (its) technology\\". The manor is of stone, and mainly of three storeys. Until renovations in 1912, the building had a large porte-coch√®re at the front, and a winter garden at the rear.

Biography Born in Copenhagen on 19 January 1829, Josephine Amalie Lund was the daughter of J√∏rgen Andersen Lund (1774-1862) and Ane Christine Rasmussen (ca. 1802-68). In 1861, she married the singing prompter August Zinck (1831‚Äì85). Josephine Lund's impressive singing voice was discovered while she was at school when her singing teacher encouraged her to perform on stage. She was later trained under the opera singer Peter Schram and the composer and music teacher Edvard Helsted. In 1851, she began singing in concerts at the Musikforeningen where she was acclaimed for her interpretation of songs from Cos√¨ fan tutte and, in 1854, for playing the mother in the first performance of Niels Gade's Elverskud. She sang lieder by Schubert and Schumann together with Julius Steenberg, as well as works by Peter Heise. She received further training in London in 1857 from the Spanish singing instructor Manuel Garc√≠a, returning to Copenhagen to give a solo concert at the Casino Theatre. She first performed as an opera singer at the Royal Theatre in 1858, playing Benjamin in √âtienne M√©hul's Joseph. She was even more successful as Ingeborg in Johann Hartmann's Liden Kirsten and was able to release the full potential of her talents as Orsini in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia. After Charlotte Bournonville's rather disappointing performances of Azucena in Il trovatore, she was entrusted with the role. In 1869, on Gade's recommendation, she left the theatre to sing in Leipzig where she presented works by Peter Heise to great acclaim. Zinck's last performances were in 1871, both at the Royal Theatre and Musikforeningen. She officially retired in 1874. Josephine Zinck died in Copenhagen on 25 November 1919 and is buried in the Assistens Cemetery.

His arrival in Buenos Aires  Juan Br√®thes was born on February 24, 1871 in Saint Sever sur l'Adour (Landes) in southwestern France. Third son of a humble family, his parents were Jean Br√®thes and Claire Tauzin.Rossi Belgrano page 13 to 15 In a semirural environment, his father worked as a planter, and from his childhood he became familiar with the insects that caused the gills of the wood. At an early age he joined the Congregation of the Brothers of the Christian Schools , also known as Brothers de La Salle . With them he learned Latin, drawing and many disciplines that would help him in his future activities. In 1890, when he was only nineteen, he arrived in Buenos Aires as a member of a contingent of Brothers who had the mission of serving as a teacher and educator in different environments. Between 1892 and 1899 he worked as a teacher of the preparatory classes to enter the baccalaureate of the Colegio del Salvador. At the beginning of the 20th century he joined the faculty of the recently completed Lasalle School . One of his first activities was to create the Museum of Natural Sciences of the School. With his own contributions and from the students, he gathered important pieces, achieving the value of the collection and laying the foundations for the realization of a great museum that continues to this day. He directed it until 1907, his successor being Brother Esteban Fournier.  His first steps Rossi Belgrano page 15 to 17 Beginning in 1897, the young Brother Judulien went every Thursday to the National Museum of Natural Sciences, requesting help to classify the insects he had kept in a box shaped like a book. In those years, he donated insects and arachnids to the National Museum, which he collected in his research. The contributions of Br√®thes can be seen in the \\"Notes Fitoteratol√≥gicas\\", published by √Ångel Gallardo in 1899.Gallardo Angel, Notas Fitoteratologicas, Museo Nacional de Buenos Aires, 1899  The magic carpet of Jean H. Fabre  Fabre stood out as a naturalist, humanist and entomologist. Personal friend of Charles Darwin , despite his convictions opposed to the theory of evolution . At the end of the 19th century, Fabre came in contact with Br√®thes and asked for his help to study the South American beetles . Brother Judulien worked with great energy, sending to the French sage abundant material that aroused his enthusiasm. In his most recognized work, \\"Souvenirs Entomologiques\\" , Fabre gave a recognition to his collaborator in Buenos AiresRossi Belgrano page 18 to 21: \\"... Then my desire to travel returns, more intense than ever, if one could find a seat on the carpet that we read in The Thousand and One Nights, the famous carpet on which one should sit to be taken wherever he pleases . Oh wonderful transport! If only I could find a small place in it and with a return ticket! I find it. I owe this unexpected good fortune to a Brother of the Christian Schools, Brother Judulien, of the La Salle College of Buenos Aires. His modesty would be offended by the praises his debtor owes him. Let's just say that, following my instructions, your eyes take the place of mine. He seeks, finds, observes, sends me his notes and his discoveries. I observe, seek and encounter him, by correspondence. I get it; Thanks to this first level collaborator, I have my seat on the magic carpet. Here I am in the pampas of the Argentine Republic, wanting to establish a parallel between the work of Serignan peloton beetles (where Fabre was conducting his studies) and that of his rivals in the Western Hemisphere ...Fabre Henry, Les Bousiers des Pampas\\" in \\"Souvenirs Entomologiques, tomo IV, chapitre V  Collaborating with Florentino Ameghino  In 1902 Florentino Ameghino agreed, after a long wait, to the direction of the National Museum of Sciences. In recognition of the tenacious work developed by Br√®thes, he offered to take charge of the entomological section, thus becoming the first specific entomologist of the museum (previously the task was in charge of the same Carlos Berg , director of the institution)Rossi Belgrano page 24 to 31 Ameghino reported \\"... as far as insects are concerned, a few days ago the manager of the entomological section, Mr. Br√®thes, took possession of his job. Now he is taking knowledge of the collection, which is in a state that you could not imagine ... \\"Ameghino Florentino, Obras Completas y Correspondencia Cientifica, Vol. 22, 1935 He served in this task for 26 years, until the time of his death. During the direction of Ameghino the activity in the Museum took an almost feverish rhythm with great amount of publications and important works. Br√®thes joined the task with great enthusiasm. Over the years, remembering those times he would write: \\"... Ameghino made known his\\" Recherches de Morphologie Phylog√©n√©tique sur les molaires sup√©rieures des Ongul√©s \\", a work that occupies the whole volume referred to. It was a work that saw the light in ten months While the first notebooks were being printed (I was in charge of the drawings illustrating the work), the manuscript was followed and the corrections were accompanied: thus with a parallel and multiple work, Ameghino carried out his fruitful and tireless task .... \\"Brethes Jean, Nunquam Otiosus V,Imp. Ferrari, 1926 He was also in charge of making the microscopic preparations and of translating the works into French, among them a work of capital importance: \\"My Creed\\". The ties with Ameghino became very close. \\"... The ten years that I have lived in daily contact with Florentino Ameghino, from 1902 to 1911 when he died, allowed me to appreciate the intimate depths of this great man. And to express my thought in one word, I will say that he was a superior man ... \\"Brethes Jean, Nunquam Otiosus V,Imp. Ferrari, 1926  Family  By 1902 he had definitively left his habits and his scientific activities were advancing steadily. His decision did not mean in any way a rupture or estrangement, the Order in which he professed did not imply the ecclesiastical vote, and Br√®thes kept unchanged the principles and values that had led him to exercise the ministry. Therefore he continued practicing as a professor of Natural Sciences in the school of Salvador with his former Brothers.Rossi Belgrano page 31 to 34 However, it was difficult for the young scientist to take such an important step, says Dr. Jos√© Liebermann \\"... The beginning was hard for Br√©thes; he was received as a public translator, and he had to give lessons and dedicate himself to various activities ... \\"Dallas E. D. Juan Brethes Bio Bibliografia SEA magazine, 1927 '' Around 1902 he met his later wife, Leontina Rossi Belgrano, an excellent draftsman and painter. The marriage took place in the Parish of Monserrat, on September 7, 1903. The family of Leontina became an important support for Br√®thes who had no relatives in Argentina. In 1904 his first son was born: Juancito Julio Br√®thes.Rossi Belgrano page 34 to 37  Struggling against pests  At the beginning of the 20th century lobster sleeves were devastating crops. It was decided to look for different strategies to combat them. √Ångel Gallardo proposed to bring the Canadian specialist Felix D'Herelle to the country, so that he could direct the Bacteriological Section of the Entomological Institute and develop a locust parasite coccobacillus, however, the desired results were not obtained.Rossi Belgrano page 53 to 60  Scientific Expeditions  Through his constant dedication Br√®thes managed to turn the National Museum into an international center of first level, to which they sent their collections from all over the continent (and even Europe) to be systematized. = Shipping from Brazil = In 1918 Dr. Antonio Ronna sent a batch of specimens he had found in the vicinity of San Pablo. In his honor Br√®thes baptized one of the new species as Heteroscapus ronnai. = Campaigns in Peru = In the same year the first scientific university expedition was organized in Peru, organized by the wise Carlos Rospigliosi Vigil and in 1920 a second expedition with the Swedish aid and the participation of Otto Nordenskj√∂ld . All the collected material was sent to Buenos Aires for its taxonomic classification. As a thank you Br√®thes called Tanava rospigliosi to one of the found types. = Links with Chile = From the first years of the 20th century Br√®thes had established a strong friendship with Carlos Porter , classifying the new species that he sent from the Blanco River (on the western slope of Aconcagua ). With the years Br√©thes made more than fifty publications in the Chilean Magazine of Natural History that founded and directed Porte. = Exemplary of Paraguay = In 1910 the wise Mois√©s Bertoni arrived in the country and had the opportunity to meet with Br√®thes. The relationship continued for many years and, after the death of the Swiss scholar, through his son Arnold Winkelried Bertoni. On several occasions entomological material was sent for its classification and mutual tributes were made. So Bertoni called Minixi brethesi a species found by him and Br√©thes corresponded with the Nortonia bertonii Brethes Juan, Quelques insectes du Paraguay, Revista Chilena de Historia Natural, XXVIII, p√°g. 67-72, 1924. = Australian Expedition = At the end of 1920, an Australian mission arrived in Argentina with the objective of finding natural enemies of the cacti that were plagues of agriculture in New South Wales . After contacting Br√®thes, they toured La Rioja, Catamarca, Mendoza and C√≥rdoba. Delivering the collected material to the authorities of the National Museum for classification and study.Brethes Juan, Himen√≥pteros y d√≠pteros de varias procedencias. Anales Sociedad Cient√≠fica Argentina, XCIII, p√°g. 119-45, 1922. = Brother Apollinaire Marie of Colombia = In Bogot√°, he carried out a task similar to that of Br√®thes, Brother Apollinaire Marie (Nicol√°s S√©iller) of the La Salle schools. He was therefore an old companion of the Franco-Argentine entomologist. Both scientists contacted about 1926. In the magazine Reason and Faith it was announced: \\"... Several hymenopterans from Colombia sent by Br. Apolinar Mar√≠a, from Bogot√°, to Mr. Br√®thes, from Buenos Aires, have given occasion to him to describe several species of the Braconid, Icneumonid, Apid, Vespid, and a new genus of the latter ... \\"Brethes Juan, Hym√©nopt√®res du Colombia, Nunquam Otiosus V, 1926 = The British Museum = In 1924 the Argentine Scientific Society announced:\\"... We have the satisfaction of letting our readers know that the Museum of London (British Museum) has just given one of our men of science and a member of our Argentine Scientific Society an uncommon show of confidence for its moral and scientific worth. . Know that this Museum has a worldwide resonance for its most valuable collections, which it cares for with an admirable zeal, for its publications, the fruit of a scrupulous scrupulousness, for its naturalistic travelers who walk silently all over the world, for the small number of naturalists - but elected - those who are allowed to study their collections, etc. The fact that the British Museum proposes a naturalist to contribute to the study of his collections, taking the first step, is honorable and worthy of attention; even more so when it comes to sending these collections to distant regions with the contingencies inherent to long journeys. These and other highly favorable considerations for our scientific environment and for our country have suggested the following letter that the British Museum has addressed to the director of the entomological section of the National Museum of Natural History, Dr. Juan Br√®thes, following the publication of his last work in these Annals ... \\"Una Distinci√≥n, Anales de la Sociedad Cientifica Argentina, 1924 In fact it was the collection of coccinellids collected by Charles Darwin on his expedition aboard the Beagle . The results obtained were so important for the authorities of the London museum that five more shipments were made for the study of Juan Br√®thes. = Entomological Institute of Berlin = The wise Walther Hermann Richard Horn, director of the Entomological Institute of Berlin , requested the collaboration of Br√®thes for the classification of the South American hymenoptera that were part of the collection of his Institute. As a result of this work, two articles published in 1927 were published in the journal Entomologische Mitteilungen . They were called \\" Hym√©nopt√®res Sud-Am√©ricains du Deutsches Entomologisches Institut \\"  Acknowledgments in species  There are many species dedicated to Juan Br√®thes.

He was the son of 41st Da'i al-Mutlaq Abduttayyeb Zakiuddin III and the brother of the 42nd Da'i al-Mutlaq Syedna Yusuf Najmuddin. He was a Dai, scholar and poet and one of the most venerated Dawoodi Bohra Dai's.  Life  He was born on 12 Safar 1189 Hijri (14 April 1775 AD), succeeded the 42nd Da'i al-Mutlaq on 18 Jumada al-Thani 1213 Hijri (28 October 1798 AD), and died on 12 Dhu al- Qi'dah 1232 Hijri (23 September 1817 AD) and is buried in al-Qubbah al- Najmiyah in Surat. He was only twelve when his father died. He was then brought up by his elder brother Syedna Yusuf Najmuddin in Surat. Syedna Najmuddin himself was a great scholar. He trained and educated Abde Ali Saifuddin in the tradition and learning that was the treasured inheritance of the Fatimid-Ismaili community. The era of Syedna Abde Ali Saifuddin was witness to intense intellectual activity. Many scholars were actively involved in the spread of knowledge throughout this period. They were the disciples of Syedna Abde Ali Saifuddin: Syedi Sadiq Ali Saheb used poetry to explain articles of faith; Syedi Abde Ali Imaduddin penned haqiqat in his eloquent verses; Syedi Shaikh Ibrahim Saifee composed a book about the laws of nikah; Syedi Shaikh Qutubuddin specialized in writing the history of Aimmat Tahereen (SA) and Duat Mutlaqeen (RA).  Legacy  * He built the educational institute Al-Dars-al-Saifee in 1224 Hijri (later renamed Al Jamea tus Saifiyah by Syedna Taher Saifuddin). The cost of the madrasah was 65,000 rupees, and Syedna Abde Ali Saifuddin (RA) built it from his personal funds. * He built the al-Masjid al-Moazzam in Surat in 1219 Hijri, which was later renovated by Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin in 1418 Hijri. * During the Indian famines of 1813 (1228 Hijri), 12,000 Dawoodi Bohras traveled to Surat where he housed, fed, maintained and uplifted them at his own expense. Not only did he take care of their food and shelter but provided them with tools so that they could practice their craft and earn money. The earnings were deposited with a committee formed by Syedna (RA). After eleven months, the mumineen returned to their hometowns and the deposited amount was handed over to them. * He made an important contribution to the development of Arabic in South Asia by developing a methodology which enabled students to quickly become proficient in Arabic. He was referred to by his contemporaries as al-Moiyed al-Asghar (the second Moiyed) after the famous Isma'ili scholar and poet Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi. * His major contributions consist of systemizing the machinery of the Da'wah, including formalizing the curriculum and setting out the rules and regulations of the Dawoodi Bohra teachings.  Works  His Diwan of poetry, compiled by his student Abdeali Imaduddin, comprises over 500 poems in Arabic and is an integral part of the curriculum at Al Jamea tus Saifiyah. He also composed the famous work \\"Ilm na moti jaro\\" (Arabic: ÿπŸÑŸÖ ŸÜÿß ŸÖŸàÿ™Ÿä ÿ¨ÿ±Ÿà) in Lisan al-Dawat which is memorized by every single Dawoodi Bohra member. He penned a series of epistles known as the al-Rasail al-Saifiyah. The Isma'il books such as Muntaza' al-Akhbar and Kitab al-Najah were written under his directives.  Death  Syedna (RA) chose Syedna Mohammed Ezzuddin as his successor and prepared him to shoulder the responsibility of dawat. Syedna Abde Ali Saifuddin (RA), troubled by ill health died on Monday, the 12th of Zilqad, in 1232 AH at a young age of 43 years.

He won the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2017 after leading a successful legal challenge against the company operating a cement kiln that was incinerating hazardous waste near his farm. Biography A farm belonging to Macerl's family stands on a hill near the town of Trbovlje. Air pollution from nearby factories has affected people and wildlife in the region for a long time. Macerl grew up on the farm, which belonged to his grandfather at the time; he has said that he remembers the effects of coal dust pollution on the farm that he witnessed as a child. Macerl, who began running the farm when he was 23, switched to raising sheep on his property after rising air pollution prevented him from raising crops any longer. The region Macerl lived in in central Slovenia had a history with air pollution from emissions from industrial towns. The area had above average rates of cancer, and of respiratory illnesses among children. The European Union introduced incentives in recent years for companies willing to incinerate energy sources such as \\"medical waste, old tires, and other industrial residue\\", in place of coal. As a result of this policy, companies such as Lafarge Cement began refurbishing old industrial plants to use the new fuel. Lafarge started burning petcoke, a byproduct of oil refining, in a 130-year old cement plant. Both cement production and petcoke burning are known to be highly polluting processes. Macerl's family farm stood near the plant reopened by Lafarge. Macerl, the president of a local environmental group called Eko Krog (\\"Eco Circle\\"), organized local residents to collect data on air pollution; though they presented this to the media, it had little impact. In 2009 Lafarge applied for a permit to burn hazardous waste at the plant; Macerl's property fell within the zone that the company said would be affected, allowing him to challenge the permit in court. Macerl was the only person legally permitted to make this challenge before the European Commission, where the legal battle went from the local authorities. The Commission ruled in favor of the residents of the town in 2015, and Lafarge was forced to stop cement production at the plant. In 2017 Macerl was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize, described in the Slovenian media as being a Nobel Prize for environmental activism. Macerl's legal battle led to him separating from his spouse. He has said that his effort had taught his three children \\"that the struggle was worth it\\".

The attack of the 2nd Panzer Army in early August created a small salient in the Soviet line. The Western Front sent the 3rd Tank Army, with the 16th and 61st Armies as support, to launch an attack to cut off the German troops in the salient. The Soviet offensive bogged down in the face of unfavorable terrain and German defenses and air superiority. Although the three armies managed to reduce the size of the salient by around , they suffered heavy losses, especially in tanks. The offensive failed to achieve its objective, but tied down German armored units in a secondary sector.  Background  = Operation Wirbelwind = Rudolf Schmidt, commander of the 2nd Panzer Army, in 1942 The German 2nd Panzer Army, commanded by Rudolf Schmidt, launched Operation Wirbelwind, an attack meant to shorten Army Group Centre's frontline by cutting off and defeating the Soviet troops of the 10th and 16th Armies stationed in the Kirov and Sukhinichi salient, on 11 August. The original attack plan would have involved a simultaneous advance of the 2nd Panzer Army form the south and the 4th Army from the north, which was to cut off the salient at its base. However, the First Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation, a Soviet attack that began in late July 1942, forced the relocation of most of the 4th Army to reinforce the defense of Rzhev. At the insistence of Army Group Centre commander G√ºnther von Kluge, the offensive took place despite this, and the attack was made with only the forces of the 2nd Panzer Army. The 2nd Panzer Army's tank spearhead force, the 9th and 11th Panzer Divisions, ran into the 16th Army's fortified defensive lines, and the 9th and 19th Panzer Divisions were halted after crossing the Zhizdra River. The 2nd Panzer Army in Wirbelwind captured the village of Ulyanovo and created a salient in the Soviet line, surrounding and destroying forward elements of three rifle divisions. = Soviet plans = The Kozelsk offensive aimed to eliminate the entirety of the German penetration and the 2nd Panzer Army by isolating the salient with a combined attack by the 16th, 61st, and 3rd Tank Armies of Georgy Zhukov's Western Front. Prokofy Romanenko's 3rd Tank Army, reinforced with additional infantry and tank units, would launch the main assault from the Belev area southeast of Kozelsk, cross the Vytebet River, and capture Ulyanovo in the German rear, with Pavel Belov's 61st Army following behind. Meanwhile, Ivan Bagramyan's 16th Army, spearheaded by the mobile forces of Alexey Kurkin's 9th and Vasily Burkov's 10th Tank Corps, and Viktor Baranov's 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, was to attack from positions southwest of Kozelsk and destroy the German defenses along the Zhizdra. Continuing their advance, Bagramyan's troops were to link up with those of Romanenko and Belov at Ulyanovo to complete the encirclement of the 2nd Panzer Army.  Comparison of forces  3rd Tank Army commander Prokofy Romanenko, post-1944 The 3rd Tank Army, which had not yet seen combat, included the Semyon Bogdanov's 12th and Vasily Koptsov's 15th Tank Corps, as well as the 179th Separate Tank Brigade, and the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions. Immediately before the beginning of the offensive, the 1st Guards Motor Rifle Division, four regiments of artillery from the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK), two Guards mortar (Katyusha rocket launcher) regiments, two anti-tank fighter regiments, and five anti-aircraft artillery regiments, as well as other units. The army amounted to 60,852 men and 436 tanks, including 48 KV tanks, 223 T-34 tanks, three T-50 light tanks, and 162 T-60 and T-70 light tanks, as well as 168 armored cars. The artillery strength of the army included 677 guns and mortars, including 124 45 mm anti-tank guns, as well as 61 37 mm anti-aircraft guns and 72 Katyushas. Romanenko's army was further reinforced by Dmitry Mostovenko's 3rd Tank Corps with 78 tanks and other units from the northern group of the 16th Army. The 16th Army was composed of nine rifle divisions, three cavalry divisions, four separate rifle brigades, seven tank brigades, one fighter anti-tank brigade, two tank battalions, three artillery regiments from the RVGK, five anti-tank artillery regiment, seven Guards mortar battalions, and two mortar regiments. However, the army's shock group consisted of the 322nd Rifle Division and two cavalry divisions, the 2nd and 7th Guards, while the rest of the units were concentrated on the army's center and right flank. The 16th Army's 9th and 10th Tank Corps amounted to roughly 100 tanks, for a total of around 700 tanks involved in the offensive. The 61st Army's southern group included two rifle divisions, three rifle brigades, a fighter anti-tank brigade, two tank brigades, and three artillery regiments from the RVGK. The three Soviet armies fielded a total of 218,000 troops. Against them, the 2nd Panzer Army could muster Heinrich Cl√∂√üner's LIII Army Corps, Josef Harpe's XXXXI Panzer Corps, and XXXV Army Corps, consisting of the 296th, 293rd, 134th, 52nd, 56th, and 26th Infantry Divisions, the 11th, 17th, 9th, and 20th Panzer Divisions, and the 25th Motorized Division. The German forces had roughly 200 tanks and assault guns between them, which meant that they were outnumbered by more than 3:1 in armored strength.  Prelude  The 3rd Tank Army moved its tanks to Kozelsk by rail from the Tula area between 15 and 19 August, while motorized units performed a road march of . The 25 kilometer march from the railway station to the front was completed by 21 August, but the rifle divisions took longer to reach the front due to their lack of motor vehicles. The army was divided into three shock groups (Group Koptsov, Group Bogdanov, and Group Mostovenko) by its commander. Each shock group was built around a tank corps and included a rifle division and artillery units. Group Mostovenko included two rifle brigades instead of a motor rifle brigade. The first echelon, tasked with the breakthrough, included three rifle divisions and a rifle brigade. The second echelon consisted of nine tank and three motor rifle brigades, and in the third echelon were the 1st Guards Motor Rifle Division, the 179th Tank Brigade, the 8th Motorcycle Regiment, and the 54th Motorcycle Battalion. The orders for the offensive were issued on 18 August, giving three days of preparation to division and brigade commanders, although the late-arriving 154th and 264th Divisions of the 3rd Tank Army had only a day to prepare. On the night of 20‚Äì21 August, the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions, tasked with the initial breakthrough in 3rd Tank Army's sector, moved into their jumping-off positions. German intelligence detected the Soviet buildup, allowing them time to strengthen the forward defenses of the LIII Army Corps with large numbers of anti-tank weapons, minefields, and hastily dug trenches and dugouts. The German armor was withdrawn rearwards to create an operational reserve, and constructed rear defenses with multiple lines of dugouts and bunkers. The German defenses were based on the Zhizdra and Vytebet Rivers, the network of ravines, and settlements turned into fortified strongpoints.  Battle  The attack began at 06:15 on 22 August, with Romanenko sending three rifle divisions and a rifle brigade in the first echelon against the 26th and 56th Infantry Divisions. The Soviet infantry units were able to advance through the outer German defenses, but did not break through, although they were able to capture the village of Goskovo and advance to Myzin in the morning before being halted by German tanks moved up from the second line. At 07:20, Zhukov committed the 12th Tank Corps, led by the 30th and 106th Tank Brigades. After outrunning their supporting infantry, the corps was stopped by strong German defenses, minefields, and air strikes by Junkers Ju 87 Stukas and other bombers in the Goskovo area after an advance of by noon. The 15th Corps' T-34-equipped 113th Tank Brigade was thrown in behind the 154th Rifle Division and soon advanced beyond the infantry, but suffered heavy losses to German airstrikes after being stopped in a minefield. The 15th's 17th Motor Rifle Brigade was then committed, but this also failed to renew the offensive. At noon, the Western Front headquarters received a report that the 3rd Tank Corps had captured Smetskiye Vyselki, and that the German troops were hastily retreating from the first defensive line. Since Group Koptsov had failed to achieve a breakthrough, Zhukov personally ordered the 15th Corps north into Mostovenko's sector, tasked with advancing on Slobodka and Belyy Verkh. The 1st Guards Motor Rifle Division was ordered to advance between the 3rd and 15th Tank Corps towards Smetskaya, Zhukovo, and Perestryazh, and the 12th Tank Corps' attack was shifted north towards Myzin and Durnevo. As a result, the original battle plan was abandoned and the tank brigades advanced into new sectors without route reconnaissance or infantry support. This caused the tanks to get stuck in minefields and swampy forested terrain. Additionally, the message on the capture of Smetskiye Vyselkami turned out to have been false when the 15th Corps' screening detachment was ambushed and completely destroyed upon approaching the village, and vanguard led by Koptsov was involved in heavy fighting. The corps' 105th Heavy Tank Brigade and 17th Motor Rifle Brigade launched an attack on the village, taking it at 17:00 and dislodging the 56th Division's 192nd Infantry Regiment after losing seven tanks, but were unable to continue the advance. Meanwhile, the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions, supported by the 12th Tank Corps, captured the villages of Ozernenskoye, Ozerno and Goskovo, but the southern group of the 61st Army made no progress. On the first day, the three shock groups advanced less than . Meanwhile, Group Mostovenko bypassed German resistance, reaching the Vytebet by 24 August, and captured the village of Belyy Kamen on 26 August, but could advance no further. On 23 August, the units continued the advance on the previous axis of attack. The 12th Tank Corps, supported by the 154th Division, advanced southwest on Myzin, Babinkovo, Durnevo, and Staritsa. The forward detachment of its right flank 97th Tank Brigade, composed of 15 tanks and a motor rifle company, was cut off by German forces and wasn't taken out of the encirclement by the 106th Brigade until the end of the day. Romanenko committed his reserve, the 1st Guards Motor Rifle Division, to assist the 15th Tank Corps' attack on 23 August in the center of the army's assault. However, by this time, Cl√∂√üner had shifted the 11th and 20th Panzer Divisions to stiffen the German infantry. That night, another attack failed due to poor coordination and the lack of a detailed plan. At dawn on 24 August, after suffering heavy losses in exchange for an advance of , the 3rd Tank Army was again stopped by German tanks and aircraft. By the end of 24 August, only 10 serviceable tanks were left in the 12th Corps' 30th Tank Brigade. At this point, fuel shortages resulting from Soviet inexperience at supplying large tank formations began to affect the operations of the Soviet armored forces. The 1st Guards were able to advance another and capture Smetskaya, further reducing the size of the German penetration, but were also halted on 25 August. By the end of the same day, Group Mostovenko and the 15th Corps cleared German resistance from positions east of the Vytebet and reached the river, but were unable to cross. The 12th Tank Corps, the 154th and 264th Divisions, and the southern group of the 61st Army unsuccessfully attacked to the west and southwest during this period, in some areas advancing . To put steam back into the offensive, Romanenko made the decision to regroup his forces. On the night of 26 August, the 15th Corps was transferred from the center to the left flank of the offensive with orders to advance south to Sorokino alongside the 12th Corps and 154th Division. After completing a march of , the 15th went on the offensive, but was again unsuccessful. After the 15th had been repulsed, the 11th and 20th Panzer Divisions launched a counterattack, forcing Romanenko to withdraw the 15th Tank Corps to the Novogryn area to create an operational reserve.By the morning of 27 August, the German counterattack was thrown back, and the 15th was transferred to the left flank in the Pakom area to support the attack of the southern group of the 61st Army. The corps was supposed to break through the line and into the German rear, simultaneously pressed by Group Bogdanov and the 264th Division. The corps attacked in conjunction with the 12th Guards Rifle Division towards Leonovo on 28 August, but was stopped by an anti-tank ditch, which was bridged by sappers that night. However, the corps ran into a second ditch which could not be overrun. At this point, the southern group of the 61st Army, frontally assaulting German strongpoints, had advanced on its right and on its left. On the next night, the 15th was pulled out of the line and by the morning of 30 August concentrated in the forests south of Meshalkino. An attack with Group Bogdanov towards Sorokino was planned, but was instead cancelled due to the 12th Tank Corps' heavy losses. During the day, the corps' 195th Tank Brigade helped two battalions of the 61st Army's 156th Rifle Division escape encirclement. Meanwhile, Group Mostovenko managed to cross the Vytebet, and Romanenko shifted the attack yet again to the center and right flank. The 15th Corps and 264th Rifle were transferred there, while the 12th Corps was withdrawn to the operational reserve to repel possible German counterattacks. Only 181 tanks remained in the army by this time, which meant that the losses of the previous nine days amounted to around 60% of the corps' armor, although some of the damaged tanks were later repaired. On 1 September, in a meeting between Hitler and von Kluge, it was decided that Operation Wirbelwind would be abandoned and the 9th and 11th Panzer Divisions pulled out of the sector for a new attack due to the Soviet resistance. After regrouping his army, Romanenko launched another unsuccessful attack on the afternoon of 2 September. Despite massive German air attacks, Group Mostovenko took Volosovo, and after crossing the Vytebet, the 1st Guards Motor Rifle Division seized Zhukovo and Volosovo. The heaviest fighting took place in the center, near the village of Ozhigovo, which was attacked by the 264th. It took until the morning of 3 September to drive German troops out of the village, after a night attack by the 17th Motor Rifle Brigade and the 113th and 195th Tank Brigades. The 15th was to exploit the breakthrough, however, the 195th, advancing to Perestryazh, was counterattacked and halted by German tanks, of which 13 were claimed destroyed by Soviet forces. Despite this, the offensive had to be halted, and Group Mostovenko failed to advance during the day. On the evening of 3 September, the 3rd Tank Corps was withdrawn to the RVGK as a result of its heavy losses. From 5 to 9 September, the tank brigades remaining in the bridgehead over the Vytebet, supported by infantry, attempted to resume the offensive, but failed due to counterattacks by the 9th and 17th Panzer Divisions. On 10 September, the 3rd Tank Army shifted to defense, and in the second half of the month, having transferred the 1st Guards Motor Rifle Division, the 15th Corps' 17th Motor Rifle Brigade, and artillery units to the 16th and 61st Armies, it was withdrawn to the RVGK. The attack launched by the 16th Army was similarly unsuccessful. On the first day of the offensive, the 16th Army's shock group was halted by a combination of unfavorable terrain and being too weak to break through the German line after advancing a few hundred meters. The main forces of the 16th Army's left flank advanced south instead of east towards the 3rd Tank Army, slowly forcing the German troops back to a previous defensive position. By 29 August, the army's left flank had reached the line of Gretnya, Vosty, and Volosovo, having advanced between in eight days. A rifle division from the army reserve was sent into the fight in the Gretnya area, but was also unsuccessful.  Aftermath  After the Soviet offensive was halted, most of the remaining tank units were transferred to other fronts after both sides shifted to the defensive. Although it had prevented the German attack from continuing in the sector, the Soviet attack had gained very little, relative to the number of troops committed. Soviet tank losses in the operation numbered up to 500 tanks, out of the original 700. For the period between 22 and 29 August, the Soviet troops suffered casualties of 12,134 killed and 22,415 wounded for a total of 34,549 out of an initial strength of 218,412 men. The fighting did, however, divert scarce German Panzer divisions and air units from the main attack in the south.

He was the author of the treaty between the Zulu king Dingane kaSenzangakhona and the Voortrekkers under Andries Pretorius. Early life and background  Jan Gerritze Bantjes (pioneer, explorer, and Voortrekker scribe) was born on 8 July 1817 in the Nieuveld district of Graaff-Reinet and not Beaufort West. He was the third child of Bernhard Louis Bantjes (b. 20 July 1788 ‚Äì Stellenbosch) and Isabella Johanna Swanepoel (b. 30 Jan.1812, Stellenbosch). Bantjes was historically of mixed descent: his great- grandfather Gerrit (Jan Geerts) Bantjes (Dutch/French speaking) arrived at the Cape in 1755 and became an independent (free-burger) VOC clerk under Governor Rijk Tulbagh at the Cape Castle collecting rents and taxes for the VOC treasury. He married Hilletje Agnieta Jacobse at Paarl, Drakenstein whose mother was an emancipated Malaysian slave, Her father was a Frenchman. She was known to be an attractive woman. Bantjes' great-grandson Jan Gerritze Bantjes (Voortrekker) was described as being of coloured complexion in 1837 during the Great Trek, but this is not mentioned again in later descriptions. He was one of the first Europeans to explore Port Natal in 1834 with Uys, and due to his better education, documented the journey from Grahamstown to Port Natal and on their return, wrote the \\"Natal-land Report\\" which was the catalyst for mobilising the Great Trek. He gave both President Steyn and President Paul Kruger their grounding educations, wrote the Dingaan/Retief land treaty of Feb.1838, wrote the famous Bantjes Journal and documented the Battle of Blood River 16.Dec.1838. Later his son Jan Gerrit Bantjes discovered the first Witwatersrand Gold Reef and started the world's greatest gold rush and Johannesburg. His other son Bernard Louis Bantjes (Born Pietermaritzburg, 1841) became a prosperous property developer in Johannesburg. Jan Gerritze' ancestors (Jan Bantjes & Jacomina Leussen) in The Netherlands during the 1700s were wealthy merchants and privateers, including financing Governor De Sabloniere in developing plantations in Guyana, South America. They owned properties from Kampen and Amsterdam to the West Indies and Batavia. The ships, farmlands and properties would later become the basis of what would be known as the Bantjes Millions, a mythical testament invented by whoever knows who. (Possibly Nonnie Bantjes or Mrs.Wright) Jan Gerritze Bantjes was baptised at the Dutch Reformed Church in Graaff-Reinet on 6 October 1817. Other siblings included Martha Sibella, Racheal Hilletje, Anna Francina, Hendrik Jacobus, and Pieter Andrias. His father Bernard Louis Bantjes had a trading store and a farm in the Nieuwveld a district of the town and was quite prosperous. Career  In March 1834 Boer leaders of Uitenhage and Grahamstown discussed a so-called Kommissitrek or ‚ÄúCommission Trek‚Äù to explore Port Natal and the region and properly assess its potential as a new homeland for the Cape Boers disenchanted with British rule. Petrus Lafras Uys was chosen as expedition leader and Jan Gerritze Bantjes as secretary and scribe. In early May 1834, Jan Gerritze Bantjes at Graaff Reinet was offered to join the expedition to Port Natal to investigate the possibility of a new Dutch homeland, and, encouraged by his father Bernard Louis Bantjes, word was sent to Uys offering his clerical abilities and writing skills to partake in this adventure. Bantjes wanted to help establish Dutch independence away from British rule at the Cape. J.G.Bantjes was already known in the area as an educated young man fluent in both spoken and written Dutch or English, and due to these skills, was encouraged by Uys to join this voyage to Natal. J.G.Bantjes‚Äô writing skills would prove invaluable recording events as the journey unfolded. Bantjes‚Äô journal on the Kommissitrek is now lost. In December 1836, Bantjes and several family members left the Graaf Reniet district with veldkornet Jacob de Clerq. On New Year's Day 1837, he joined the Voortrekkers under Andries Pretorius at Thaba Nchu. The following year he joined the Wenkommando and acted as Pretorius' secretary. In 1838, he wrote the journal of the expedition and of the Battle of Blood River which took place on 16 December 1838 and resulted in the defeat of the Zulu king Dingane kaSenzangakhona and his army. Bantjes is generally regarded as the author of the treaty between the Voortrekkers and the Zulu king. In 1839, he settled in Pietermaritzburg, where he was a founder of the town. Here he served as a clerk to the Volksraad of Natal and practiced law. He returned to the Cape Colony in 1840 after the construction of Church of the Vow for which he arranged the financing. His reason for leaving may have been to escape a lawsuit. In 1848, he acted as teacher and clerk of the church council at Fauresmith. He also appears to have run a shop in Prince Albert for some years. In 1863, he moved to Pretoria, where he served as a magistrate's clerk and later Postmaster General of the South African Republic. He became a teacher and prosecutor in Lichtenburg and Ventersdorp. He died at his son's home in Potchefstroom in 1887. The Bantjes gold mine was named after his eldest son, Jan Gerrit Bantjes (1843‚Äì1914), a pioneering prospector who discovered the Witwatersrand gold reef in June 1884 and laid down the roots of the first settlement which later became Johannesburg.Jan Gerritze Bantjes on sahistory.org.za, accessed on 8 July 2012 References 1817 births 1887 deaths 19th-century South African educators South African educators ","title":"Jan Bantjes"},{"id":"54276933","text":"Makol Cuei is a boma in Baidit payam, Bor West County, Jonglei State, South Sudan, about 30 kilometers north of Bor.

The regiment gained notoriety as the first unit in the Union Army to suffer fatal casualties in action during the Civil War in the Baltimore Riot and the first militia unit to arrive in Washington D.C. in response to President Abraham Lincoln's initial call for 75,000 troops. Private Luther C. Ladd of the 6th Massachusetts is often referred to as the first Union soldier killed in action during the war. In the years immediately preceding the war and during its first enlistment, the regiment consisted primarily of companies from Middlesex County. During its first term of service, four out of ten companies of the regiment were from Lowell, Massachusetts. Colonel Edward F. Jones commanded the regiment during its first term. He later commanded the 26th Massachusetts and was awarded the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general. During its second and third terms of service, the unit was commanded by Colonel Albert S. Follansbee. The regiment first enlisted for a \\"90-day\\" term of service which lasted from April 16 to August 2, 1861. Following their engagement in the Baltimore Riot, the 6th Massachusetts proceeded to Washington and then returned to Baltimore to guard locations within the city as well as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad station at Elkridge, Maryland. Their second term of service lasted nine months from August 1862 to June 1863. During this time the 6th Massachusetts was attached to the VII Corps and participated in several expeditions and actions in the vicinity of Suffolk, Virginia, most notably the Siege of Suffolk and the Battle of Carrsville in April and May 1863. Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt's bravery at Carrsville earned him the Medal of Honor. The 6th Massachusetts served a third term in response to the call for troops to defend fortifications around Washington. During this term, which lasted 100 days from July to October 1864, the 6th Massachusetts garrisoned Fort C. F. Smith in Arlington, Virginia and guarded Confederate prisoners of war at Fort Delaware near the mouth of the Delaware River. Earlier units The 6th Massachusetts regiment that served during the Civil War was formed in 1855 during the reorganization of the Massachusetts militia. Other units dating back to the 18th century were given the designation 6th Regiment Massachusetts Militia. They were formed and disbanded at various times and although they shared the same numerical designation, there was no continuous unit known as the 6th Massachusetts. One of the units designated as the 6th Massachusetts was a regiment that served during King George's War in the Siege of Louisbourg in 1745. During the Revolutionary War, the 6th Massachusetts Regiment was engaged in the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battle of Harlem Heights, the Battle of Trenton and the Battle of Saratoga. 90-day term of service =Preparations= alt=A black and white lithograph depicting a long column of soldiers at a large train station preparing to board a trainShortly after South Carolina issued its Declaration of Secession, Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew anticipated imminent civil war and issued an order on January 16, 1861, to the ten existing Massachusetts units of peacetime militia to immediately reorganize and prepare for active service. Colonel Edward F. Jones was the first militia commander to respond to the Governor's order. His letter indicating the regiment's readiness, dated January 21, was brought to Boston and read in the Massachusetts Senate by then state Senator Benjamin F. Butler. On April 15, 1861, three days after Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter, President Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 volunteers to serve in putting down the insurrection. The call was relayed by Governor Andrew to the existing regiments of Massachusetts militia the same day. Eight companies of the original 6th Massachusetts (one from Acton, one from Groton, two from Lawrence, and four from Lowell) gathered in Lowell on April 16 and proceeded to Boston. That night, the men of the 6th Massachusetts barracked in Faneuil and Boylston Halls. The next morning, April 17, three companies previously belonging to other Massachusetts militia units (one from Boston, one from Stoneham, and another from Worcester) were added to the 6th Massachusetts to form a regiment of 11 companies total. Thus composed entirely of existing volunteer militia companies, the 6th Massachusetts was made up of volunteer soldiers. The regiment proceed that day to the State House, where Governor Andrew presented regimental colors to Colonel Jones. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston for Washington via railroad at 7 p.m. on April 17. =Baltimore Riot= alt=A black and white lithograph depicting a formation of militia soldiers with bayonets fixed surrounded by riotersOn April 19, 1861, the 6th Massachusetts boarded train cars in Philadelphia in the early morning hours and departed for Washington via Baltimore. Before the end of the day, the regiment saw combat during the Baltimore Riot. The date was the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord which began the American Revolution. Although Maryland remained in the Union, secessionist sentiment and support for the Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of sabotage to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause derailment and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m. Trains passing through Baltimore at that time could not proceed directly through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at President Street Station on the east side of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on Pratt Street by horsepower to Camden Station on the west side of Baltimore's Inner Harbor, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing. alt=A sepia toned portrait photograph depicting the head and shoulders of a young man in an elaborate militia uniform. He wears a tall dress uniform hat.The blockage of the railroad left four companies, numbering 220 men, at President Street Station with no choice but to march through the city to reach Camden Station, slightly more than one mile away. The size of the crowd obstructing their path was estimated at roughly 10,000. Captain Follansbee, the senior captain, took charge of the detachment. After crossing the Pratt Street Bridge, which had been partially dismantled by the crowd, Follansbee ordered his men to march at the \\"double-quick.\\" This roused the crowd further as they perceived the quickened pace as an indication of panic. As well as stones and bricks being thrown, shots were now fired at the 6th Massachusetts from the stores and houses around them. Captain Follansbee gave the order to return fire. Seventeen-year-old Private Luther C. Ladd, a factory worker from Lowell, was hit in the head by a piece of scrap iron that was thrown from a rooftop and fractured his skull. As he staggered, one of the rioters took Ladd's musket from him and fired, wounding him in the leg. Ladd died on Pratt Street. He is known as the first Union soldier to be killed in action during the Civil War. Three other militiamen were killed during the riot: Private Addison O. Whitney, Private Charles A. Taylor and Corporal Sumner H. Needham. A total of 36 members of the 6th Massachusetts were wounded. A formation of approximately 50 officers of the Baltimore Police eventually placed themselves between the rioters and the militiamen, allowing the 6th Massachusetts to proceed to Camden Station. The companies boarded the train which quickly got underway for Washington, though the crowd followed the train for some miles attempting to stop it. A total of 12 civilians were killed during the riot and an unknown number were injured. =Garrison duty= The 6th Massachusetts reached Washington D.C. on April 19, 1861, the first unit to arrive in response to Lincoln's call for troops. A large, cheering crowd welcomed them at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station which once stood north of the Capitol. Among the crowd was Clara Barton who became a famed nurse during the Civil War. At the time a clerk in the U.S. Patent Office, Barton gained her first experience in caring for wounded soldiers as she tended to injured men of the 6th Massachusetts. alt=An antique photograph depicting a city square with a stone monument and a large number of soldiers at restThe 6th Massachusetts was barracked in the Senate Chamber in the Capitol. The next morning, tensions in Washington were high as rumors circulated of an impending Confederate attack. After reviewing the 6th Massachusetts, Lincoln expressed his anxiety to the members of the regiment, telling them, \\"I don't believe there is any North. The Seventh Regiment [New York] is a myth. Rhode Island is not known in our geography any longer. You are the only northern realities.\\" In the days and weeks after the Baltimore Riot, newspapers and politicians across the country drew comparisons between the Massachusetts militia who had fought on April 19, 1775, at the start of the Revolution and the Massachusetts troops who fought on April 19, 1861. Among the 6th Massachusetts were descendants of those Minutemen who had fought in Lexington and Concord in 1775. Due to the coincidence of the date and the ancestry of some members, the 6th Massachusetts was often called the \\"Minutemen of '61.\\" The 6th Massachusetts remained in Washington until May 5, when they were assigned to garrison a key railroad relay station about 15 miles outside of Baltimore at Elkridge. Their presence there helped keep open the crucial rail line from the northeastern states to Washington. The regiment returned to Baltimore on May 13, when Major General Benjamin F. Butler occupied the city with several Union regiments in anticipation of a Confederate attack on Baltimore which never developed. The 6th Massachusetts marched through the city to Federal Hill, where they set up camp for a short stay of three days. On May 16, the regiment returned to the Elkridge relay station. They served out the majority of their term at the relay station and vicinity, except for a second assignment in Baltimore from June 26 to July 1, 1861. The regiment's return to Boston at the close of their 90-day term was delayed slightly by special request of Major General Nathaniel P. Banks. In light of the recent Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, in which the 6th Massachusetts did not participate, he asked the regiment voluntarily remain at Elkridge another week in the event of a Confederate advance on Washington. On July 29, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to break camp and boarded trains for Boston which was reached on August 1. The regiment was mustered out on August 2, 1861. 9-month term of service =Organization and departure= The regiment was again activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven of the ten original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was necessary in order to fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was different than the 90-day term. To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term. Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at Camp Henry Wilson in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship Plymouth Rock. Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city. =Blackwater River expeditions= alt=A sepia toned photograph of five soldiers standing at parade rest in a neat line Upon reaching Washington, the regiment was ordered to Fortress Monroe and from there to Suffolk, Virginia. The 6th Massachusetts was assigned to the Second Brigade (commanded by Colonel Robert S. Foster) of the First Division of the VII Corps. They served garrison and picket duty in the vicinity of Suffolk, occasionally taking part in reconnaissance expeditions to the Blackwater River (which represented the boundary between the Union occupied counties of southeast Virginia and Confederate territory of the interior) and engaged in minor skirmish actions. Their first such expedition took place on October 3, 1862, about two weeks after the regiment reached Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts formed a peripheral part of the Expedition against Franklin, a joint effort of the U.S. Army and Navy to dislodge a growing force of Confederates threatening the Union garrison at Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts held a road near Western Branch Church, far from the main action at Franklin, and here loaded their muskets for the first time in action. Although the 6th Massachusetts did not see any combat during their first expedition, and many members recalled it as tedious, the sight of ambulances carrying dead and wounded from the battle made a strong impression on the new recruits. During a second expedition to the Blackwater on December 11, 1862, the 6th Massachusetts was lightly engaged near Zuni, Virginia and lost their first casualty in battle during their second enlistment‚Äî2nd Lieutenant Robert G. Barr. The regiment did not again leave Suffolk until an expedition on January 29, 1863, again towards the Blackwater River. Confederates opposed this Union advance on January 30 during the Battle of Deserted House in an isolated location about ten miles west of Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts was sharply engaged and lost five killed and seven wounded. =Siege of Suffolk= The majority of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees in front of the defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk. This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts. In early 1863, Major General James Longstreet was given command of the Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His objectives were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied a position on the right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the Nansemond River. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates. On May 3, 1863, Longstreet abandoned the siege and began moving his forces north to rejoin the Army of Northern Virginia. The next day, the 6th Massachusetts was among the units sent in pursuit of the retreating Confederate force. Only minor skirmishing took place as the bulk of the Confederate force had already escaped beyond reach of the Union infantry. The 6th Massachusetts took about 80 Confederate stragglers prisoner and burned every building they came across along the Somerton Road to deny shelter to any additional Confederate stragglers or deserters. =Battle of Carrsville and Medal of Honor recipient= Major General John A. Dix, commanding Union forces at Suffolk, conducted several reconnaissances in force to determine the disposition of Confederate forces remaining in the region. On May 13, the 6th Massachusetts joined another expedition to the Blackwater River. This was the final action of their second term of service. The column was commanded by Major General Foster and Colonel Follansbee was promoted to command of the brigade to which the 6th Massachusetts belonged. A considerable Confederate force attacked the Union expedition in a sharp engagement on May 14‚Äì15, 1863, known as the Battle of Carrsville or the Battle of Holland House. During this fight, the 6th Massachusetts supported the 7th Massachusetts Battery and exchanged in heavy, prolonged firing with the Confederates. The 6th Massachusetts made an advance, driving the enemy into the woods, then were driven back and made a second counter-attack, reclaiming their position at the start of the battle. The regiment suffered casualties of five killed or mortally wounded, twelve wounded and five prisoners. In the middle of the battle, when the 6th Massachusetts was driven back, Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt of Company C perceived that several of his comrades had been hit and were left in the woods. In an effort to pull them out, he rushed forward, towards the Confederate position. In this action, he earned the Medal of Honor. According to his citation, \\"When ordered to retreat, this soldier turned and rushed back to the front, in the face of heavy fire from the enemy, in an endeavor to rescue his wounded comrades, remaining by them until overpowered and taken prisoner.\\" Sweatt was eventually released; the three men he endeavored to rescue did not survive. On May 18, the 6th Massachusetts and other regiments fell back to Deserted House outside of Suffolk. On May 20 they were posted in support of artillery at Windsor, Virginia. Finally, on May 23, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to return to Massachusetts. The regiment reached Boston by steamship on May 26 to be welcomed and addressed in front of the State House by Governor Andrew. The 6th Massachusetts then proceeded to Lowell, where they were received with enthusiastic festivities. The regiment reassembled on June 3, 1863, at Camp Wilson and were mustered out. In all during their second enlistment, the regiment lost 13 men killed or mortally wounded in combat and 18 by disease. 100-day term of service alt=A lithograph of a large column of soldiers without weapons in disorderly dress marching outside a large stone fort being guarded by a few soldiers in dark uniforms holding riflesIn May 1864, Major General Ulysses S. Grant removed fresh troops from the defensive fortifications of Washington and transferred them into the field to strengthen the Army of the Potomac. To man defenses around the capital in their place, and to relieve regiments at various northern fortifications, Lincoln issued a call for 500,000 troops to serve a brief term of 100 days. This measure would allow enough time to raise longer- term regiments to occupy rearward defenses. The 6th Massachusetts was activated for a third time in response to this call for 100-day regiments. The regiment organized at Camp Meigs in Readville, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston beginning July 13, 1864. Colonel Follansbee again commanded the regiment. The roster of field and staff officers was fundamentally the same as their previous nine-month term of service. They departed on July 20 for Washington, reaching the city on July 22. They were posted on Arlington Heights in Fort C.F. Smith. Their month of service there was mundane, consisting of regular drills, inspections and fatigue duty. On August 21, 1864, the regiment was ordered to move. They traveled by rail to Philadelphia and by steamship to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island on the Delaware River. The regiment relieved the 157th Ohio Infantry and commenced garrison and guard duty over the 7,000 Confederate prisoners of war held at Fort Delaware. There had been widespread instances of mistreatment of prisoners by Union units that previously garrisoned the fort, including abuse and theft of prisoners' property. Members of the 6th Massachusetts condemned these practices and generally refrained from similar abuses. Their duty consisted of standing post and escorting prisoners on various work details. The fort was large and in excellent condition. The barracks were newly constructed, comfortable, and included a library and other amenities. The field and staff officers as well as several company officers were joined by their wives and children at the post. The regimental historian recorded that many members of the unit remember their time at Fort Delaware as extremely pleasant. On October 19, 1864, the 6th Massachusetts was relieved and began the journey back to Boston, which they reached on October 21. The regiment reported to Camp Meigs on October 27, 1864, and were mustered out for the third and last time. During their third term, the regiment lost 10 men to disease. Sumner Needham memorial On the 3d of May, 1861 the body of Sumner Needham was conveyed to Lawrence by a Committee of the City Government, and placed in the City Hall, where it was appropriately draped; the seats were filled; and every inch of standing room was occupied. Seven Protestant ministers participated in his funeral. A memorial was erected in Bellevue Cemetery : \\"A Loyal North, in common with his widow and an only child, mourn his loss. A.D., 1862.\\" Ladd and Whitney memorial alt=A black and white lithograph of a city square, a stone obelisk and large formations of militia soldiers in dark uniforms parading past the monumentShortly after the bodies of Privates Luther Ladd and Addison Whitney were brought home to Lowell, Massachusetts, after the Baltimore Riot, city officials began planning the construction of a monument honoring their sacrifice and memorializing the first casualties of the Civil War. An appropriation of $2,000 was secured from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and a further $2,700 was provided by the city. The monument was constructed in front of the Lowell courthouse in what is now known as Monument Square. Ladd and Whitney had both been buried in the Lowell Cemetery. On April 28, 1865, their remains were re-interred in a vault beneath the monument. The monument was to be dedicated on April 19, 1865, on the anniversary of the Baltimore Riot, but the ceremonies were delayed due to the assassination of President Lincoln. It was instead dedicated on the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, a local holiday, June 17, 1865. The procession numbered more than 4,500 people. Governor Andrew gave the oration acknowledging the men whom he called \\"the first martyrs of the great rebellion.\\" Later units The 6th Massachusetts continued as a peacetime militia unit following the Civil War, typically meeting for annual musters at various camps in Massachusetts. During reorganizations of the Massachusetts militia in 1866 and 1877, the 6th Massachusetts was consolidated and some of its companies disbanded or transferred, but the regimental organization remained intact. The regiment was again activated during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The 6th Massachusetts of 1898 participated in the Puerto Rican Campaign. The 181st Infantry Regiment, which was formed from elements of other units and first inducted into federal service on January 16, 1941, claims lineage from the 6th Massachusetts and other militia units. As of 2017, the 1st Battalion of this regiment was active as an element of the Massachusetts National Guard.

Kimbell is best known as the star of the 1954 science fiction film, Monster from the Ocean Floor. Beginning in the early 1990s, Kimbell preserved the Jones Theater in Westcliffe, Colorado, and founded the Westcliffe Center for the Performing Arts. Early years Kimbell was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Andrew and Kathryn (n√©e Collins) Banks. She moved to Hollywood, California with her family when she was three years old. At the age of four, she was cast in her first radio role on The Children‚Äôs Radio Workshop in Los Angeles, which began her radio and voice acting career. She joined the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) when she was just twelve years old. She studied theater in New York City under Lee Strasberg. Kimbell later received her Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of Virginia and her master's degree in women's studies from George Washington University in Washington D.C.  Film  Kimbell's earliest film credits included 1945's Roughly Speaking, where she played Rosalind Russell's daughter, and Growing Up, as John Garfield's on- screen sister. Kimbell starred in the lead role in 1954's Monster from the Ocean Floor, the first film produced by Roger Corman, as well as the British comedy, Girls at Sea, in 1958. During the 1950s, she co-starred in the Broadway production of The Seven Year Itch alongside Eddie Bracken and the touring production of Arms and the Man with Marlon Brando. She also co-starred in several other films, including Feudin' Fools in 1952, The Bob Mathias Story, and the 1958 British comedy, Girls at Sea.  Television  Kimbell's television credits included recurring roles and guest spots on General Electric Theater, Chevron Theatre, The Adventures of Kit Carson, Crossroads, and the BBC's Sunday Night Theatre.  Stage  Kimbell starred in the London production of Roar Like a Dove, which was produced by actress Vivien Leigh.  Personal life  Kimbell met her future husband, James F. Relph, a United States Foreign Service officer, while appearing on stage in London. The couple married in London. She effectively retired from film to join Relph at his diplomatic postings in Switzerland, Germany, Chad, and Tunisia. Kimbell and her family returned to California during the early 1980s. During her later life, Kimbell divided her time between her home in Westcliffe, Colorado, and a second home in Laguna Beach, California.  Administration  =California= Kimbell served as the executive director of the Orange County Center at the University of Southern California, which encourages professionals to obtain advanced degrees in business, education or social work. She also founded an \\"Enterprising Woman\\" organization to support female entrepreneurs. =Colorado= In 1992, Kimbell traveled to Colorado with the intention of purchasing a horse ranch. She acquired the ranch as planned, but also purchased the Jones Theater in Westcliffe, Colorado, which the previous owner had intended to convert into a laundromat. Kimbell wanted to preserve the theater as a working cultural landmark in the Wet Mountain Valley. She founded the Westcliffe Center for the Performing Arts (WCPA) and based it at the theater. She and her business partner, Tom Stagg, expanded the WCPA and oversaw the addition of the new Studio 2 onto the existing Jones Theater. Kimbell was also developed the Shakespeare in the Park festival, which is now held annually in Westcliffe. She served as the WCPA's president, producer and, finally, its artistic director until her death in 2017. =Other countries= Kimbell developed women's cultural programs in Tunisia and a school for women in Chad.

It is a Grade II listed building. History John Cust, 1st Earl Brownlow, owner of Belton House from 1807-1853 commissioned Salvin to undertake improvements to the Belton Estate in 1838. Salvin's additions included a public house, a cross in Belton Village, cottages and houses for a gamekeeper and a blacksmith, a hermitage and the boathouse on Boathouse Pond. Most of the work was carried out in a Tudor style but the boathouse was built to resemble a Swiss Cottage. Salvin did not complete the works, being replaced by Cust's Clerk of works. The boathouse fell into disrepair in the 20th century and was unrestored at the time Historic England's listed building entry was written. Its restoration in 2008, carried out under the auspices of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, which now owns Belton House, made use of traditional materials and craftsmanship and has won a number of awards. The boathouse is a Grade II listed building. Architecture The boathouse stands at the lower end of the pond. It is designed in the style of a Swiss Cottage. This style was popular in mid-Victorian England and another example of such a chalet can be seen at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The boathouse is timber-framed and plastered. The roof is of Collyweston slate tiles in a fish scale pattern.

The most common back-scatter applications are air- traffic radar, bistatic forward-scatter guided-missile and airplane-detecting trip-wire radar, and the US space radar. It is also a less common propagation mode used by radio amateurs.  History  Airplane scatter itself had been discovered in 1930, but radio amateur usage lagged until the late 80s. The advent of inexpensive SDR based and distributed real time flight tracking enabled precise scheduling, increasing feasibility.http://www.nitehawk.com/w3sz/W3SZ-NEW-AirCraftScatterNEWS2014.pdf  Radio amateur usage  Compared to a single trail of meteor scatter, the time of opening caused by a single airplane is longer it can be from 30 seconds up to a few minutes. Slight asymmetry can sometimes be encountered both in terms of exact timing and the gain of the path. Range and possible contact lengths are affected by the size of the plane, flight level and the approximate crossing time of the central part of the straight line between the two communicating stations. Both the onset and decay of the channel is rapid, so to improve success rate, a short contact procedure is used. Contact opportunities can be predicted based on the precise flight paths of surrounding planes. There exist software solutions for prediction using local (Mode S and ADS-B) or online sources. Microwave access using high gain antennas needs to consider precise aiming that takes into account elevation angles as well.

She was named after a local Lake Victoria region and was one of many compact Lake Victoria steamships operated by the Uganda Railway. Bow, McLachlan and Company of Paisley in Renfrewshire, Scotland built her as a \\"knock down\\" vessel; that is, she was bolted together in the shipyard at Paisley, all the parts marked with numbers, disassembled into many hundreds of parts and transported in kit form by sea to Mombasa, Kenya. The kit was shipped by railway to Kisumu on the shore of Lake Victoria for reassembly and launch in 1913. In the First World War Kavirondo was armed as a gunboat. In 1921 she was still recorded as a functioning vessel based in Kisumu - her telegraph address was recorded as 'Kavirontug'. Between 22 August 1927 and 19 February 1928 the SS Kavirondo was chartered by Michael Graham on behalf of the British Colonial Office in order to conduct the first ever Fisheries Survey of Lake Victoria.

History  The Shinayakana Systems Approach was the first approach in a wave of East Asian systems scientists theorizing about their systems methodologies in the last decade of the twentieth century using the concepts of intuition and group collaboration, which has resulted in several new approached to knowledge creation.  The Name  \\"Shinayakana\\" is an adjective in Japanese, the closest translation to English is \\"supple.\\" The meaning is something between hard and soft.  The Approach  The Shinayakana Systems Approach tried to resolve the controversy between hard and soft systems methodologies, using the Eastern philosophy of yin and yang. The approach does not specify an algorithmic recipe for knowledge and technology creation, only a set of principles for systemic problem solving: \\"Using intuition, keeping an open mind, trying diverse approaches and perspectives, being adaptive and ready to learn from mistakes, and being elastic like a willow but sharp as a sword - in short, Shinayakana.\\" This approach is an interactive, intelligent and interdisciplinary (I3) system approach with emphasizing honesty, humanity and harmony (H3). = Interactive = The Shinayakana Systems Approach limits the role of mathematical methods and models to that of problem solving support only because the authors believe that no model will ever incorporate all human concerns.

His only league goal came in a 4‚Äì0 home victory over Port Vale on 20 April 1957, though he also scored an FA Cup goal in a 2‚Äì1 second round win at Tranmere Rovers on 6 December 1958. A serious bout of 'flu in December 1957 left him unfit to play until the following April. Altogether, Kilkenny played 147 league and cup games for Doncaster, scoring two goals.

The film shows two men dancing together (see stag dance). Gay balls, cross dressing balls or drag balls, depending on the place, time, and type, were public or private balls, celebrated mainly in the first third of the twentieth century, where cross dressing and ballroom dancing with same sex partners was allowed. By the 1900s, the balls had become important cultural events for gays and lesbians, even attracting tourists. Their golden age was during the Interwar period, mainly in Berlin and Paris, even though they could be found in many big cities in Europe and the Americas such as Mexico City and New York City.  Precedents  \\"Molly\\" or \\"macaroni\\" from the 18th century By the end of the 17th century, a gay subculture is documented in Europe, with their cruising areas, their bars, their parties and balls, their cross-dressers, and their own slang. Scholars like Randolph Trumbach consider it is the moment when gay subculture appears in Europe. On the contrary, historian Rictor Norton considers unlikely that such a subculture would appear fully formed, and thinks that it was actually the increase in surveillance and police procedures that brought to the surface an underground culture that had not been visible up to that moment. The archives of the Portuguese Inquisition in Lisbon preserve information of the so-called \\"dan√ßas dos fanchonos\\" from the beginning of the 17 century. About 1620, the \\"fachonos\\", the baroque equivalent of modern drag queens, organized big parties in the Gaia Lisboa, the gay Lisbon. These itinerant celebrations, called \\"escarram√£o\\", or \\"esparram√£o\\", used to include pantomimes with racy scenes, where some of the participants were dressed as women, and other as men. His Majesty's High Court in Mexico City discovered in 1656 a similar case, when Juan Correa, an old man, over 70 years old, confessed that he had been committing the unspeakable vice since his childhood. Correa's house, in the outskirts of the city, had been used as a meeting point to celebrate balls, where many men dressed as women. Several studies have not found similar phenomena in the judicial cases in Aragon, Catalonia, the Basque Country or Valencia, even though in the Valencian case there are evidences of a subculture and a possible gay ghetto. In Spain, cross-dressing was socially only allowed for carnival, when even those closest to the king could dress as women. On the other hand, in France, during Louis XIV's reign, no ball was complete without cross-dressers. By the end of the 17th century, there was a completely developed gay subculture in London, with the molly houses used as clubs, where gays met regularly to drink, dance and have fun. These taverns are well known thanks to the Mother Clap's molly house scandal from 1726, when a police raid discovered that her molly house was a gay brothel.  Cross dressing balls  Hermann von Teschenberg (1866-1911) dressed as woman. Teschenberg, a cross-dresser, was one of the founders of the Scientific- Humanitarian Committee. = Germany =  The Empire  Berlin's clandestine gay underground can be followed up to the 18th century, in spite of the persecution gays were suffering. In Prussia, Paragraph 143 of the penal code, and later the introduction of Paragraph 175 in the German penal code, with other laws for public scandal, and child protection, made the life of gays extremely difficult. In fact, the activities of Magnus Hirschfeld or the first homosexual movement could not avoid the regular police raids and closing of premises in the 1900s. And not just the premises were being watched by the police, in 1883, the moral police had 4799 \\"transvestite\\" and transgender woman under vigilance, even though \\"permits\\" could be handed out to cross- dressers in cases considered \\"medical\\". It is thus surprising that, beginning mid 19th century, the Urningsball or Tuntenball came to be, balls of uranians, or queens, tolerated, but watched by the police. By the 1900s, these balls had achieved such a fame in Germany, that people from all around the country, and even foreign tourists, would travel to Berlin to participate. These balls were celebrated in large ballrooms, as the Deutscher Kaiser, in the Lothringer Stra√üe, or the Filarmon√≠a, in the Bernburgstra√üe, the Dresdner Kasino, in the Dresdner Stra√üe, or the Orpheum, in the Alter Jakobstra√üe 32. For example, the Berliner Morgenpost described extensively on October 17, 1899, a gay ball that had taken place in the hotel K√∂nig von Portugal, where balls were still being celebrated in 1918. The ball season used to begin in October and go until Easter, with a frequency of several balls a week, sometimes two the same day. Hirschfeld, in his book Berlins drittes Geschlecht (1904; \\"Berl√≠n's Third Sex\\"), described the balls in following fashion: As a consequence of the Harden‚ÄìEulenburg affair, and the subsequent social upheaval, the balls where prohibited; in 1910 they were allowed again, but they never achieved the splendor of this golden age.  The Weimar Republic  After the I World War appeared the first mass movements for homosexuals, the Freundschaftsbund, popular associations of gays and lesbians that dedicated an important part of their effort to socialization and diverse activities for their members, like excursions, visits, sports, and balls. For example, the club Kameradschaft (\\"camaraderie\\") organized on November 1, 1929, celebrating their anniversary, a B√∂ser-Buben-Ball (\\"Bad Boys Ball\\"); the club reached 100 members, and survived until 1933. Kameradschaft tried to offer some support and activities for gays from lower extraction; so their balls were celebrated on weekends, Saturdays or Sundays, and gathered about 70 men, many without a job, who could pay the low entry price. In 1922 the association Gesellschaftsklub Aleksander e.V. celebrated balls every day, beginning 7 o'clock p.m., with a quality orchestra. In 1927 the Bund f√ºr Menschenrecht (BfM) bought the Alexander- Palast, but that same year they changed to the Florida and the Tanz-Palast salon of the Zauberfl√∂te, in the Kommandantenstra√üe 72, in Berlin. The BfM balls took place from Tuesdays to Sundays; the entry was free, but you had to pay 50 Pfennig for a dance card that allowed you to actually dance. In the 1920s gay balls reached enormous sizes, with premises filling several ballrooms with some thousands of men. And not just in Berlin, several other cities in Germany organized smaller balls for gays. The Eldorado of the Motzstra√üe, in Berl√≠n, 1932. The sign includes their motto: \\"Hier ist's Richtig!\\". In the 1920s and 30s, there were uncountable bars, caf√©s, and dance halls in Berlin. The most elegant could be found in West Berlin, near the area formed by the B√ºlowstra√üe, the Potsdamer Stra√üe, and the Nollendorfplatz, reaching up to the Kurf√ºrstendamm. No doubt, the most famous was Eldorado, that really was two, one on the Lutherstra√üe, and a second one in the Motzstra√üe. Curt Moreck (Konrad Haemmerling) described it in 1931, in his F√ºhrer durch das ‚Äûlasterhafte‚Äú Berlin (\\"Guide through the 'dissolute' Berlin\\"), as \\"an establishment of transvestites staged for the morbid fascination of the world metropolis.\\" The program at the Eldorado included loud and racy shows by drag queens, addressed mostly to a heterosexual audience, that, now as then, wanted to \\"satisfy their curiosity, and dared to visit the mysterious and infamous Berlin\\". Moreck continues, even though he himself was encouraging, and was part of this kind of voyeuristic tourism with his travel guide: Dance scene (dancing people in Eldorado) (1910), sketch by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938) Eldorado became one of the nocturnal cultural centers in Europe. The establishment hosted from bank managers to members of parliament, as well as theater actors and movie stars. Amongst them, divas like Marlene Dietrich, often with her husband Rudolf Sieber, and Anita Berber, singers like Claire Waldoff, and writers, like Wolfgang Cordan, Egon Erwin Kisch, or Josef Hora. Magnus Hirschfeld was well known there. The co-founder and commander of the SA, Ernst R√∂hm,; extracts from the book was also a patron, and Karl Ernst, later a nazi politician and Gruppenf√ºhrer SA, tried to survive for a time working ‚Äîdepending on the source‚Äî as a waiter, an employee, or a rent boy citing from ‚ÄûEin schwuler Emigrant [7] [‚Ä¶]‚Äú) in the Eldorado of the Lutherstra√üe. The ballroom cum cabaret has been mentioned, directly or indirectly, serving as inspiration, in many literary works, as in Mr Norris Changes Trains (1935) and Goodbye to Berlin (1939) by Christopher Isherwood, or the memories of Erika, and Klaus Mann. The atmosphere has been captured in paintings by Otto Dix, and Ernst Fritsch. By the end of the 1920s, the German society had taken their image of homosexuals from this kind of establishment: decadent, refined, depraved, degenerate, tightly linked to drugs, wild sex, and prostitution. The Bund f√ºr Menschenrecht tried to distance gays of this kind of milieu in 1927, but to no avail. In 1932 the chancellor Franz von Papen started a campaign against the \\"depraved night of Berlin\\", and in October of that same year all balls for homosexuals were prohibited. On January 30, 1933, the nazi party came to power, and on February 23, 1933, the Prussian Interior Minister ordered that all bars \\"that have abused [their permit] to promote immorality\\" be closed. He was referring specially to those \\"that are frequented by those who pay homage to the anti- natural immorality\\". On March 4, 1933, the Berliner Tagblatt informed about the closing of some establishments the day before. Of the over 100 establishments catering to homosexuals in Berlin very few survived, and those would be used to help watch and control the homosexual population. = France = Drawing of a carnival ball about 1909, with the commentary \\"AU BAL DE LA MI-CAR√äME\\". The drawing was done by Hungarian artist Mikl√≥s Vad√°sz, and shows a blushing rich man arm in arm with a young woman, herself kissing another man; on the left, what seems two to be men dancing together. The image was published in the number 422 of the anarchist magazine L'Assiette au Beurre, titled Les p'tits jeun' hommes (\\"The little young men\\"), dedicated to the decadent aristocrats, and the effeminate kept men. In France, until the end of the 19th century, gays and lesbians met usually in private homes and literary salons, hidden from the public, with the Opera Ball in Paris one of the few exceptions. The Opera Ball, celebrated yearly for carnival, allowed some small leeway. The first big public ball that allowed cross dressing was the Bal Bullier in 1880, in the Avenue de l'Observatoire, followed by the Bal Wagram in 1910. After World War I, Paris became one of the nightlife centers in Europe, with focal points in Montmartre, Pigalle, and Montparnasse, and numerous short-lived bars catering to gays and lesbians, surviving between police raids, ruinous scandals, and the public's insatiable thirst for new thrills. Many establishments were also known for drug trafficking. Journalist Willy described the atmosphere in the bar \\"The Petite Chaumi√®re\\", catering to foreigners looking for strong sensations: A sign from the 1920s. In the 1920s there were several balls in the Bastille area, mainly in the Rue de Lappe, where workers, drunken sailors, and colonial soldiers gathered to dance. It wasn't strictly a homosexual milieu, but men could dance together, and you could find a partner for the night. Daniel Gu√©rin described one of the dens as a place where \\"[...] workmen, prostitutes, society women, johns, and aunties all danced. In those relaxed and natural days, before the cops took over France, a chevalier could go out in public with a mate of the same sex, without being considered crazy.¬ª On the other hand, Willy presents a completely different aspect of the milieu, \\"What you see are little delinquents, not too carefully washed but heavily made up, with caps on their heads and sporting brightly colored foulards; these are the guys who, when they fail to make a buck here, will certainly be found hauling coal or other cargo.\\" The so-called bal de folles, and later bal de invertis, flourished in Paris after the I World War, and even in other French cities as Toulon. In Paris, homosexuals were attracted mainly to the Bal Musette de la Montaigne de Sainte-Genevi√®ve, in the number 46 of the Rue Montaigne de Sainte-Genevi√®ve, where you could find gays and lesbians. Later, the big balls for carnival attracted a gay public, as the one celebrated yearly in the Magic-City, in the rue de l'Universit√©, 180, inaugurated in 1920, and active until the prohibition on February 6, 1934. In time, the \\"Carnaval interlope\\" in Magic- City became a big event, visited by prominent vedette from the variet√©s, like Mistinguett, or Jos√©phine Baker, that handed over awards to the best drag queens. The Bal Wagram offered the opportunity to cross dress twice a year; at 1 a.m., the drag queens did the pont aux travestis, a costume competition, doing the catwalk in front of the most selected people of Paris, that came to walk on the wild side for a night. The drag queens participating came from all walks of life, and ages, and presented a savage satire of the society, its values, and its traditional hierarchies, with images of exaggerated femininity, and masculinity: countesses dressed in crinoline, crazy virgins, oriental dancers, sailors, ruffians, or soldiers; theirs names were correspondingly colorful: Duchess of the Bubble, the Infante Eudoxie, the Mauve Mouse; the Dark One, Sweetie Pie, Fr√©da, the Englishwoman, Mad Maria, the Muse, the Teapot, the She-wolf, Sappho, Wet Cat, Little Piano, Princess of the Marshes, Marguerite if Burgundy, etc. Charles √âtienne, in his novel Notre- Dame-de-Lesbos, describes \\"Didine\\" in following fashion: Many of the onlooker just went to insult and harass the gays participating, as Charles √âtienne describes in his novel Le Bal des folles: = England = tabloid The Illustrated Police News on the week of the raid at Temperance Hall, in Hulme, Manchester There are at least two instances of cross dressing balls that have been documented in England. The first one was known through a police raid of a ball celebrated in the Temperance Hall, in the Hulme area of Manchester. On September 24, 1880, the Chief Constable of Manchester received anonymous information about an event \\"of an immoral character\\" that was about to take place in the Temperance Hall of Hulme. The detective Jerome Caminada was despatched with police constables to observe the ball and make any necessary arrests. Of the 47 men that congregated, all wore fancy dress costumes, 22 as women; a pair was dressed as Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and another as Romeo and Juliet. The windows of the Temperance Hall had mostly been blacked out and so Detective Caminada and his contstables had to observe the ball from a neighbouring rooftop. Caminada reported that the ball had begun at 9.00 pm, that dancing had commenced at around 10.00 pm and that every now and then, a couple disappeared into a side room. Just after 1.00am, midful that some guests had started to leave, Caminada gained entry to the ball by giving the password \\"sister\\" in an effeminate manner to a doorman dressed as a nun. After the door was opened, the police raided the building, and detained all participants. The trial showed that some of the revellers were not from Manchester and were regulars of similar balls that were organized in several cities, as Leeds, or Nottingham. The men were boud over to keep the peace on two sureties of ¬£25 each, a significant sum. Some were unable to pay it and ended up in prison as a result. All the arrested men had their names, addresses and professions published widely. LGBT History Month in the UK commissioned Stephen M Hornby and Ric Brady to write a three part play about the ball as part of the first OUTing The Past festival in 2015 in Manchester. The play was called \\"A Very Victorian Scandal\\" and Dr Jeff Evans acted as the Historical Adviser to the writers. Dr. Matt Houlbrook, of the University of Liverpool, affirms that in the 1920s and 30s, cross dressing balls were being held secretly almost every weekend, gathering 50 to 100 men. And this, in spite of it being illegal, and being a big personal risk for those participating: they didn't just risk prison, if found out, they could loose their livelihood, be isolated socially, and finally suffer a nervous breakdown, or try suicide. In 1933 headlines informed about \\"Lady Austin's Camp Boys\\" scandal. The affair begun when 60 men were detained in a private ball room, in Holland Park Avenue, in London, after cross dressing police officers had been watching them dancing, made up, dressed as women, and having sex. Twenty seven men were arrested, and convicted between 3 and 20 months of jail. Even so, many stood up for their behavior, notoriously Lady Austin, who said \\"There is nothing wrong [in who we are]. You call us nancies and bum boys but before long our cult will be allowed in the country.\\" = Spain = Mid 19th century, during the reign of Isabella II, appeared the sociedades de baile, \\"ball societies\\", mostly groups of young people that tried to rent some premises to organize a ball; but there were also other, more elegant, or pretentious, that rented theaters for their balls. The ball societies exclusively catering to gays appeared shortly after, mainly in Madrid, and Barcelona, as there were no special requirements to create one, and could be established, and broken up very easily. The most important ball society for the \\"Uranian flock\\" met at the El Ramillete, in the calle Alvareda, in Madrid, where you could count \\"over a hundred sodomites with elegant suits, and rich jewelry\\". In Barcelona, later, during the regency of Maria Christina, the biggest number of gay dancers met at the Liceo Rius. The dancing public was off all types, but mainly transvestites and young men of the working class ‚Äì,workers of trade, and commerce, workshop apprentices, and servants ‚Äì for whom the balls were the highest point of their lives: exploited by their employers, and frightened of being discovered by the society. The balls allowed them to forget their situation for a couple of hours, express themselves with freedom, mingle with their equals, and, with a little luck, meet someone. Other, less fortunate, as was the case for transvestites, effeminate men, and chulitos de barrio, neighborhood thugs, without a job, or rejected by their families, they used the balls to find their first time customers. For carnival, huge balls were celebrated, and the boys spend the whole year preparing their costumes for that important day. At the beginning of the 20th century, all these balls had already disappeared, and were just a memory of the past, as recounts the author Max Bembo in his book, La mala vida en Barcelona (\\"The Bad Life in Barcelona\\"): \\"I could not find in the homosexualism of Barcelona the appearance it used to have; the parties where the baptism of homosexuals were celebrated; the very scandalous balls; the sardanapalic festivities, the shame of the city\\". It's very probable that the disappearance of these public balls was due to the application of laws of public indecency, and the consequent withdrawal of the homosexual life into private residencies, and clubs. = United States =  Stag dance  Cowboy stag dance from about 1910 During the 19th century, in the United States, mainly in the Great West Frontier, there were many towns where women were few and far between. So, for cowboys, miners, loggers, or railroad workers, it was very difficult to find a woman, and marry. In these groups, men often formed intimate friendships, that sometimes ended in real love stories, that were accepted as a fact of life. It is difficult to know up to what point this was simply due to the lack of women, or if precisely this kind of life attracted those men that preferred the company of other men. In this environment, and in the military,In military circles it was not uncommon to organize balls where men would dance with each other, as women could not be part of the military, and very often were not available. There are several short films documenting the fact, as Jacks 'the Dasant', from 1922, that shows a ball celebrated on HMS Hood, with Brazilian, U.S., French, and Japanese sailors participating; Interned Sailors, from about 1914‚Äì1918, is a short film of unknown origin, depicting a group of sailors looking, while two play the accordion, and other dance together; or male soldiers dancing together during WWI, that shows a group of sailors dancing on a ship. is where the stag dances developed, and where men danced with each other, without it having any special meaning. Beemyn talks about the stag dances celebrated in San Francisco during the gold rush, in 1849. Thousands of young men arrived to the city from all continents, converting a small frontier town into an amusement city, where everything was possible. Thanks to the lack of women, and prejudices, men had fun with each other, also dancing. In these balls, the men that took the role of the woman usually wore a handkerchief knotted around their arm, but there were also those that dressed as women.  Drag ball  Portland, Oregon in the 1900s Drag balls in the United States can trace their origins to the d√©butante balls, and the costume parties, at the end of the 19th century. In the beginning, they were simple parties where men dressed as women, and women dressed as men could go, and where two men could dance with each other; but there are also records of more exclusive balls by the 1880s, where homosexuals ‚Äì men and women ‚Äì could be counted in the hundreds, up to 500 same sex couples, that slowly waltzed the night away at the sound of an excellent orchestra. In the 1920s these balls had already become big social events in the gay and lesbian world, where ‚Äîmainly men‚Äî competed for the best costume. Often, they included a \\"parade of the fairies\\", to show the costumes, and the participants with the most spectacular gowns received a price, in the form of money. The judges often were personalities from literature, and the show business. It was mainly in the black communities of New York City, Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans where these balls took place, sometimes bringing in white party-goers. In Manhattan, these balls got to have official permits, and police protection, and security, in places like the Webster Hall, and the Madison Square Garden, the Astor Hotel, the Manhattan Casino (later called Rockland Palace), The Harlem Alhambra, and the Savoy Ballroom in the Black Harlem, and the New Star Casino, in the Italian Harlem. The planners of these balls became well known: H. Mann in the 1910s, Kackie Mason in the 1920s, and 30s, Phil Black in the 1930s to 60s, were celebrated in many a novel. In 1933 they were described as: Drag ball from the 1920s, celebrated in the Webster Hall, in Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan The most famous drag ball was the Masquerade and Civic Ball ‚Äîalso known as \\"Faggots Ball\\" or \\"Fairies Ball\\"‚Äî, in Upper Manhattan's Harlem. The Masquerade and Civic Ball was celebration held every two years, beginning in 1869, organized by the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, an afro-American association independent of other American fraternal orders that did not accept black men. The ball was enormously popular, attracting even white public, but that didn't stop critics, and hecklers. And in spite of there being racial tensions, gender restrictions ‚Äîtwo men could only dance together if one of them was dressed as a woman‚Äî, and class barriers, these balls became some of the few places where black and white people could socialize, and homosexuals might even find some romance. So, one day a year, the \\"faggots\\", mainly the effeminates, didn't have to hide, had a place where they could feel free, leave behind their apprehension, and embrace fun without fear. In a world where homosexuals were harassed, and despised routinely, the possibility to see several thousands of them together celebrating themselves, interacting with their equals, allowed the creation of an extensive network, and an underground of mutual help. The balls were a central piece in the lives of many gays: the gowns were prepared for months before, and whatever happened there, the gossip was discussed for months after. Mainly the smaller balls were the objective of police raids, that sometimes arrested those participating. To justify the arrests, they used a law from 1846 that prohibited being in disguise in public, even though it had practically only been used since the change of the century to harass transvestites. Drag balls celebrated in private establishments, and homes, even though they were somewhat safer, also were often visited by the police. By the 1930s the tension with the police had extended to the balls with official permit, signaling a change in the social mores that finally had the two last grand balls in the season 1930-31 canceled. The balls entered a definitive decadence after the derogation of the Prohibition in 1933, with the libertine culture of the speakeasies, where cross dressing was allowed, disappearing with it. = Latin America =  Dance of the Forty-One  Drawing of the Dance of the Forty-One Faggots, Mexico, c. 1901 In Mexico, the country's biggest scandal at the turn of the twentieth century was the so- called \\"Dance of the Forty-One\\" or \\"Dance of the Forty-One Faggots\\". It refers to a police raid on November 18, 1901, during the government of Porfirio D√≠az, on a private home, situated in the calle de la Paz (nowadays calle Ezequiel Montes), where at that moment a group of 41 men, 22 dressed as men, and 19 as women, were celebrating a ball. The Mexican press mocked cruelly the dancers, even as the government tried to cover up the incident, as many of the participants belonged to the higher echelons of the porfirian society. The list of names was never revealed. Even though the raid did not have any legal grounds, and was completely arbitrary, the 41 detained men ended up forcefully conscripted into the military: The number 41 (or 42, as it was rumored that Ignacio de la Torre, Porfirio D√≠az's son-in-law, had escaped) became part of Mexico's popular culture as a way to refer to homosexuals, passive homosexuals for the number 42. The incident and the numbers were spread through press reports, but also through engravings, satires, plays, literature, and paintings; in recent years, they have even appeared on television, in the historical telenovela El vuelo del √°guila, first broadcast by Televisa in 1994. In 1906 Eduardo A. Castrej√≥n published a book titled Los cuarenta y uno. Novela cr√≠tico-social. Jos√© Guadalupe Posada's engravings alluding to the affair are famous, and were frequently published alongside satirical verses: Engraving from Guadalupe Posada illustrating the poem to the left  Tango  The Argentine tango, as a dance, was developed by the end of the 20th century among men, and by men that danced with other men in streets and brothels: Two women dancing the tango on a postcard from 1920 At the beginning of the 1910s the tango was discovered by Europeans, and became fashionable in Paris, but as a dance between man and woman, in a more \\"decent\\" style, without \\"cortes y quebradas\\". Historical postcards of the 1920s and 30s also show women dancing tango. But these postcards come from cabarets in Paris, and have a particularly masculine, and voyeur accent.  Rio Carnival  In Brazil, homosexuality was legalized in 1830, and kept it legal in the new penal code of 1890. But there were many different laws about public indecency, vagrancy, transvestism, or \\"libertine\\" behavior that were used to control, and repress homosexuals. But once a year, during the Carnival, the social mores relaxed, allowing transvestism, and dancing among men ‚Äîand women‚Äî, beginning in the 1930s. The costumes in the Rio Carnival became more and more elaborate, and a jury begun to give prizes to the best; these shows evolved into full balls, where only 10% of the dancers were dressed as drag queens. = Russia = There are reports of gay balls (baly zhenonenavistnikov, literally \\"balls of woman-haters\\") in Russia before the I World War, specifically in Moscow. These balls, even though they were celebrated in the zhenonenavistnik (\\"woman- haters\\") subculture, a hyper-masculine group of homosexuals, also accepted cross-dressers. Members of a clandestine gay group in Petrograd, in 1921 In 2013 a photograph (to the right) was published for the first time: it depicts a group of cross-dressed men from Petrograd that were celebrating a drag party on February 15, 1921, during the first years of the Soviet regime. The photo was taken by the forensic experts of the police that had raided the party being held in a private apartment, after receiving an anonymous tip-off about \\"antinatural activities\\" in a house in the Simeon street, number 6. Ninety- eight sailors, soldiers, and civilians were arrested ‚Äîeven though sodomy had been legalized in 1917. They had met to celebrate a \\"transvestite wedding\\", many dressed in feminine gowns, \\"Spanish dresses\\", and \\"white wigs\\", to dance the waltz and the minuet, and socialize with other men. The responsible Justice Commissar justified the raid saying that a public show of homosexual tendencies could endanger \\"non mature personalities\\". Even though none of the participants were condemned, the owner of the apartment was accused of running a brothel, according to article 171 of the Soviet penal code, a felony that could be punished with up to three years of prison, and confiscation of all, or some of the property. = Lesbian balls = Two women dancing the waltz (c. 1892) by Toulouse Lautrec Balls for lesbians were also quite common, even though not so much as male ones. Not only were they less in number, but there is less information about them, a problem common to all lesbian history. On the other hand, in western societies, two woman dancing together publicly is still acceptable nowadays, and can be done without any suspicions of lesbianism. In Mexico, on December 4, 1901, shortly after the raid to the Dance of the Forty-One, there was also a police raid of a lesbian ball in Santa Mar√≠a, but the incident had a much smaller social impact than the male equivalent. Hirschfeld, in his book Berlins drittes Geschlecht (1904), talks also about lesbian balls: Later in Germany, the \\"bowling club\\" Die lustige Neun (\\"The Funny Nine\\"\\"), created in Berlin in 1924, continued organizing lesbian balls with 200 to 300 women at least until April 1940. It is unknown if the balls, known thanks to the descriptions in the Gestapo files, continued throughout the war years; fact is, the track is lost.  Later development  = From the II World War to Stonewall in Europe = In Switzerland, even with many difficulties, the homosexual movement kept its structures over the war. The Circle, a gay magazine, organized weekly club evenings in Z√ºrich, that only subscribers could visit. Several elaborate systems were used to secure the anonymity of the participants, and only \\"Rolf\\", the editor of the magazine, had the names and addresses of everyone. For spring, summer, and fall big balls were organized, and there was also a big costume ball for carnival. An important effort was done to keep everything decent, respectable, and contained, and Rolf made sure that no man under 20 was present. This secrecy mentality was no longer acceptable to gays by the mid-1960s, and in 1967 the magazine and its organization disappeared. In France, during the occupation of Paris, all balls were prohibited, a situation that did not change after the allies entered the city. During the war, the only possibility was to meet in the outskirts of Paris, as gays did on the Christmas eve of 1935, when hundreds of men traveled 50 km in a bus from Paris to celebrate the traditional dinner. After the war, the only possibility was to travel by train to the Bal de la Chervri√®re, in L'√âtang-la-Ville, Yvelines, an establishment owned by a lesbian, \\"la Colonelle\\", that had been part of the resistance, and had enough contacts to keep her place open. The situation improved with the reopening of the Bal de la montaigne de Sainte-Genevi√®ve in 1954, organized by Georges Anys, who would keep it open until the 1960s. Possibly the most important ball was the one celebrated every Sunday evening by the magazine and association Arcadie, the Cespala (Club litt√©raire et scientifique des pays latins), in the number 9 of the Rue B√©ranger, reserved exclusively to the members of the club. There was a short revival of the gay pre-war scene after the war in Germany. The Walterchens Ballhaus organized drag balls already in 1946, and the parties at Prince Sasha's were one of the centers of gay nightlife. In Frankfurt, in 1949 reopened the bar Fellsenkeller; the bar had a police permit that allowed men to dance together. By the beginning of the 1950s this revival had been thoroughly eliminated, and gay subculture had disappeared. After the war, Amsterdam became something of a gay mecca: the biggest gay dance hall in Europe was DOK (De Odeon Kelder), initially belonging to the COC (Cultuur en Ontspanningscentrum, \\"Center for Culture and Leisure\\"), it became independent under the direction of Lou Charit√© three years after. The COC opened then another dance club, De Shakel (\\"The Chain Link\\"). The city was quite accepting of these clubs, and gay men from all around the world traveled there for the opportunity to dance freely with other men. The struggles of the homophile movement to resist the pressure of society and the authorities, trying to gain respectability, and acceptance by passing, but at the same time tying to accommodate the need to socialize, and vent for gay men, can be illustrated by the Caf√© 't Mandje: a small den in gay- accepting Amsterdam's Red-Light District, where prostitutes, pimps, seamen, gays and lesbians came openly together, allowed the dancing of two men only on the Queen's Birthday, once a year, as it did not have a dancing license. Another example is the origin of the Balletti Verdi affair (\\"green ballet\\"\\"baletti\\" means literally ballet, and is the name given at the time to sexual scandals involving minors, from similar heterosexual cases; verde means \\"green\\", and it was considered the color of gays; it was the color of the carnation that Oscar Wilde wore on his lapel.): a series of private parties in Castel Mella, organized by two homosexuals for their friends, became a political scandal of enormous proportions in the Province of Brescia in 1960 when it was discovered that minors ‚Äîbetween 18 and 21 years old‚Äî had participated. Additionally, the fact that there had been some prostitution going on had disastrous consequences for all the participants, most of them innocent, and ended with three suicides, one man fleeing the city, and many losing their jobs. A subsequent witch hunt against gays in Italy covered the whole land. As late as 1973, in the last years of Franco's dictatorship, ten men were arrested in Sitges, Spain, for going out dancing in women's clothes. The press published their photos in drag, and made snide comments for days, calling them all kinds of names. = Ball culture = In the U.S., cross dressing balls evolved into the ballroom community, or ball culture, that started in the Harlem, and in Washington, D.C., in the 1960s. Soon the balls were divided in \\"houses\\", or \\"families\\", lead by a charismatic figure. The ballroom community is still active, as has been documented in the film Paris Is Burning (1990). It has had a notable influence, mainly through Madonna's \\"Vogue\\" video, where the dancers use the vogue dancing style, developed in the ball culture, imitating the movements of models on the catwalk. Beyonc√© has also mentioned she was influenced by the ball culture, \\"how inspired she's been by the whole drag-house circuit in the States, an unsung part of black American culture where working-class gay men channel ultra-glamour in mocked- up catwalk shows. 'I still have that in me', she says of the 'confidence and the fire you see on stage [...]'\\". = After Stonewall = The Imperial Court of New York's annual Night of a Thousand Gowns Coronation Ball in Times Square After the Stonewall riots, and the appearance of the modern LGBT liberation movement, these extensive cross-dressing balls, as they had been celebrated until then, practically disappeared. There are a few notable exceptions, as the Life Ball in Vienna, celebrated yearly since 1992, or the annual Night of a Thousand Gowns in New York City, organized by the Imperial Court System, but in general they have been substituted by the dance club. By the mid 1970s, initially in New York City, appeared the discotheque, with the corresponding disco music, and disc jockeys, in close relationship with the gay scene ‚Äîsee for example Studio 54. Discotheques, and their music soon became favorites of gay men, who found in its songs gay anthems, as It's raining men, Y.M.C.A., I'm coming out, or So many men, so little time, in spite of the homophobia of some of the divas singing. Mid 1980s appears the clubbing subculture, with centers in New York City, Ibiza, London, and Paris; one of its most iconic clubs being the Sound Factory in New York City. These clubs usually offered electronic dance music to big masses of gay men. By the end of the decade, and the beginning of the 1990s, the circuit parties appear: big, outdoors parties, similar to raves, very planned, that can go on for days, and that can draw patrons from a very large territory, even from other countries. Some circuit parties, like the White Party in Palm Springs, the Black and Blue Party in Montreal, and the Winter Party in Miami, attract gay men in the thousands, and the ten thousands. In Europe, the biggest circuit party is celebrated in Barcelona, with about 70,000 men participating.

After an impi of about 600 Matebele murdered 15 to 17 Afrikaner voortrekkers on the Vaal River, abducting three children, King Mzilikazi (c. 1790 ‚Äì 9 September 1868; also known as Mzilikazi, Oemsiligasi or Moselekatse, or, in Afrikaans, Silkaats) ordered another attack. The voortrekkers, under the command of Andries Potgieter, repulsed them, but at the cost of abandoning their livestock. Attack on the camp On 9 October, King Mzilikazi sent an army of 5,000 Matabele warriors to attack the voortrekkers. About one third of these, however, were slaves whose motivation was simply to steal cattle. The voortrekkers had been warned by Betsjoena or Bataoeng bushmen about the impi's arrival two days beforehand. So they secured their laager by placing the 50 wagons in a circle and filling the spaces underneath and between them with thorn branches to prevent the attackers from crawling through. There were only 35 men to defend it. On the morning of the attack, the farmers went out to meet the enemy, in the hope of driving back the Matebele and thus avoiding a direct attack on the camp. The voortrekkers were on horseback and armed with guns, whereas the Matebele were on foot and armed only with spears and shields, but this imbalance did not prevent the Matabele from advancing slowly towards the camp. By about 3 p.m. the farmers had returned to the camp. Blockaded in, they prepared to defend themselves with a ratio of 1 voortrekker to every 150 Matabele warriors. The Matebele stood just beyond striking distance, and then positioned themselves on either side of the camp before rushing on it in a pincer movement. Some tried to crawl through the thorn branches, trying to cut off the leather straps that tied them; others threw their spears into the camp. After a few minutes, the Matabele were so badly wounded that they fled. Two farmers and 184 Matebele died. In spite of their loss, the spoil was great: The Matebele plundered 50,000 sheep and goats and 5,000 cattle, including all their draft cattle. Aftermath The Tswana (Rolong) people assisted the voortrekkers in recovering some of their cattle, but revenge attacks were also planned. On 17 January 1837, voortrekkers under the command of Hendrik Potgieter and Gerrit Maritz destroyed the town of , recovering about 6,000 cattle. In total, 15 or 16 settlements were destroyed and more than 1,000 of King Mzilikazi's warriors were killed. This was followed by the Battle of Gabeni from 4-13 November 1837, led by Potgieter and Uys. The Marico region was eventually evacuated by the Matabele population when, in 1838, about 15,000 of them traveled across the Limpopo River to settle further north in Modern-day Matabeleland in Zimbabwe. The three abducted children were never seen again.

In order to coordinate the implementation of taxation regulation in regional level, Inspectorate of Regional Tax was established, namely in Jakarta and some areas such as Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, and East Indonesia. Inspectorate of Regional Tax later became the Regional Directorate of Taxation (Regional Office) as it is today.

A native of Bryant, Arkansas, White has a background in marketing and pharmaceutical sales. Early life White is the daughter of Ken and Diane Powell of Bryant, Arkansas. She graduated from Bryant High School and went on to Arkansas State University in Jonesboro for two years. She then transferred to the University of Central Arkansas in Conway, where she completed a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Marketing in 2005. She later went to work for Teva Pharmaceuticals as a sales representative; after 15 months on the job, she suddenly left the company to compete on Survivor. Survivor White was cast on the television series Survivor: Samoa, the 19th season of the American version of Survivor. She was initially placed in the Foa Foa tribe, which lost five out of the six immunity challenges prior to the merge. She survived all those rounds without her name ever being written down for elimination. After the merge, she orchestrated the elimination of Erik Cardona by swaying Laura Morett, Kelly Sharbaugh, and Monica Padilla to convince the rest of Galu to vote for Cardona in a blindside. At Tribal Council, White's plan came into fruition and Cardona became the first member of the jury. The day after Tribal Council, White came across a rat at camp. She subsequently clubbed the rat to death and presented it to her fellow tribe members for consumption, shocking them all. On the tenth episode, there was a 5‚Äì5 tie between White and Morett. Shannon \\"Shambo\\" Waters flipped to Foa Foa to vote against Morett, while the five remaining Galu members voted against White, expecting a deadlocked tie and purple rock tiebreaker. On the revote, John Fincher of Galu flipped his vote from White to Morett, ensuring Morett's elimination and avoiding the possibility of drawing a purple rock. In the Survivor Auction, White won a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and a shower. She later bonded with Brett Clouser, over things that they both enjoyed, such as Christian books and excerpts. She went on to choose Clouser first to be on her team at the reward challenge. Although Russell Hantz was suspicious that something was forming between them, White assured him that everything was proceeding as originally planned. At the Final Five, White was told by Hantz that if Clouser were to win the next immunity challenge, she would be the next one leaving. Hantz wanted to get Clouser out before the Final Three, and needed all of the strongest men to beat him. Clouser went on to win the next immunity challenge, but Hantz's mind changed, as he felt he needed White to go with him to the Final Three. Jaison Robinson was voted off in that Tribal Council. In the final immunity challenge, White placed third out of four. Hantz went on to win that immunity challenge, leading up to Clouser's elimination. At the Final Tribal Council, White was criticized by Hantz and the jury for being a coattail rider and not doing much except to follow Hantz. White responded that she could not have made the moves that Hantz did because that would lead to her being voted out. She said that her best move that would keep her in the game was to align with Hantz, so that he could take all the damage and she would leave in everybody's good graces. Cardona finished the Final Tribal Council by stating that fellow finalist Mick Trimming had not lived up to his leader position, and that Hantz was arrogant. He stated that White might call herself the least deserving of the title \\"Sole Survivor,\\" but that \\"maybe the person who thinks she is the least deserving is probably the most.\\" Cardona went on to say that he would be voting for her, and he hoped that she would get four more votes to win. On December 20, 2009, during the live finale, it was announced that White had won the title of Sole Survivor. She won by a vote of 7‚Äì2‚Äì0, defeating runner-up Hantz and third-place Trimming. Hantz, after realizing that he had lost, announced live on the air that he would offer her US$10,000 for the title of \\"Sole Survivor,\\" but said that she could keep the $1 million prize. He then increased his offer to $100,000. White declined both offers. =Reception= According to Rhys Desmo of the Round of 32 Podcast, in the years since White won the title of Sole Survivor, she has gained a reputation as being one of the \\"worst winners\\" of all time. Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly panned the jury's decision to award her the $1 million prize, calling it a \\"travesty,\\" a \\"joke,\\" \\"absurd,\\" \\"ridiculous,\\" \\"lame,\\" and \\"the worst jury vote ever.\\"Survivor host Jeff Probst wrote that, in his opinion, Russell Hantz dominated the game, but lost to White because of a \\"jury of bitter people.\\" But former Survivor player Stephen Fishbach, in his People Magazine blog, defended White's game play while criticizing Hantz's, even pointing out that Hantz was the one who made the jury bitter. Desmo declared White a \\"perfect winner\\" while praising her social game and elaborating on the social aspects of Survivor. Other media appearances In January 2010, White hosted the \\"Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains Preview\\" special on TV Guide Network. Later that year, White was mentioned by Dr. Sheila Embry in a book about ethics and leadership. In it, Embry pointed out that White won Sole Survivor by not sacrificing her integrity or ethics, in contrast to Russell Hantz, who did everything unethically and dishonestly during the game. Embry went on to say that the final jury vote that season was a vote against \\"greed and entitled arrogance.\\" Personal life At the time of the filming of Survivor: Samoa, White was dating Justin Thomas, also a resident of Van Buren. As of 2014, she has made limited speaking engagements and purchased a new home in Blanchard, Oklahoma.

The next record on the artist places him in England where in 1676 he was admitted to the painter's guild in London (the Painter Stainers Company). During the period 1689 to 1693, paintings by van Everbroeck were regularly offered at English auctions. This could mean that he was possibly still active in London at that time. The date and place of his death are unknown.

Garland paintings are a type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp and whose earliest practitioner was Jan Brueghel the Elder. Paintings in this genre typically show a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter.Ursula H√§rting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image A sumptuous collection of fruit Van Everbroeck collaborated on garland paintings with other painters, but it is not recorded who were his collaborators. The collaborators painted the figure or figures inside the cartouche while van Everbroeck painted the fruit garland. An example is the Garland of fruit surrounding St Joseph with the Child Jesus (1667, at Hampel Fine Art Auctions on 27 March 2009 in Munich, lot 280). The artist has included a beetle on the stone ledge and a butterfly on the left side among the fruit in the garland. Van Everbroeck rendered the fruits in a luminescent and naturalistic manner, with a pronounced depth.Frans van Everbroeck, Garland of Flowers Surrounding the Holy Family at Hampel Fine Art Auctions Another example of his production in this genre is A cartouche still life of flowers and fruit around a portrait of a lady dressed as a shepherdess (At Sotheby's on 3 May 2017 in London, lot 138).Frans van Everbroeck, A cartouche still life of flowers and fruit around a portrait of a lady dressed as a shepherdess at Sotheby's Van Everbroeck is also known for his vanitas still lifes, a genre of still lifes which offers a reflection on the meaninglessness of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. An example is the composition Memento Mori (At Van Ham Kunstauktionen on 17 May 2013 in Cologne, lot 478).Frans van Everbroeck, Memento Mori at Van Ham Kunstauktionen This composition contains the typical symbolism of vanitas paintings: a skull, soap bubbles, a candle, an hourglass, a watch and a book (symbolising the futility of mankind's higher aspirations).

The game was released worldwide in October 2017, and is the sequel to the 2014 video game The Evil Within. The game received generally positive reviews; like its predecessor, it received praise for its visuals, atmosphere, and gameplay but received some criticism for its story and characters.  Gameplay  Sebastian exploring the world Similar to its predecessor, the game is a survival horror game. Played from a third-person perspective, the player assumes control of detective Sebastian Castellanos, who must descend into the world of Union to rescue his daughter, Lily. There are three difficulty modes, namely Casual, which producer Shinji Mikami recommends, Survival, and Nightmare, the latter setting being recommended for players who enjoyed the difficulty curve in the previous game. In The Evil Within 2, maps are larger and there are multiple ways for players to advance in a level. The player is also given an item known as \\"The Communicator\\", which helps to highlight the objectives, resources, and enemies featured in the game's world. It also reveals Resonance points, which provides hints regarding what had happened in the world of Union. Players can explore the map area freely to complete side objectives and scout for resources, which are scarce. Players can engage in direct confrontation with enemies using weapons like guns, or use stealth to prevent themselves from being noticed or sneak behind enemies to kill them silently. The game features a crafting system, in which players can gather resources to craft new items such as ammo. Players can craft items at any time in the game, but doing so in a workbench requires fewer crafting materials. A customization system is also present. The Green Gel, introduced in the first game, can be used to customize Sebastian's abilities, which are divided into five different trees: health, stealth, combat, recovery and athleticism. Weapons can be customized using the weapon parts players collected through exploring Union. Plot Three years after the events of the first game, Sebastian Castellanos (Marqus Bobesich) has left the Krimson City Police Department, haunted by his experiences at the Beacon Mental Hospital. His only child, Lily (Kiara Gamboa), supposedly perished in their house fire, and his wife Myra (Elizabeth Saydah), unwilling to accept her daughter's death, abandoned him. This, coupled with his trauma, results in Sebastian descending into alcoholism. Drowning his sorrows in a bar, Sebastian is approached by former partner and Mobius agent Juli Kidman (Meg Saricks), who reveals that Lily is still alive. Sebastian is brought to a secret Mobius facility against his will, where he meets the head of the facility named the Administrator (Richard Neil). The Administrator explains that Lily is being used as the Core for a new STEM system to simulate an idyllic American town called Union. However, Mobius lost contact with Lily and their agents inside Union, and they have lost control over the simulation. Sebastian reluctantly agrees to help and is plugged into STEM. Upon entering Union, Sebastian discovers the town has turned into a nightmare realm where all of the inhabitants were either killed or mutated into monsters. In addition, Sebastian witnesses a mysterious photographer with supernatural powers hunting down and murdering Mobius operatives. He manages to find surviving Mobius personnel Liam O'Neal (Jesse LeNoir), Yukiko Hoffman (Ying Hsiao), and Julian Sykes (Hari Williams), who help him in the search for Lily. As Sebastian follows her trail, he learns that she has been kidnapped by the photographer Stefano Valentini (Rafael Goldstein), a serial killer obsessed with photographing people at the moment of their death who managed to infiltrate Union. Stefano reveals that he had originally kidnapped Lily under orders from another party, but decided to keep her for himself to exploit her powers as the Core. Sebastian fights and kills Stefano but before he can rescue Lily, Myra appears and takes Lily away. Sebastian finds himself transported to the interior of a mysterious stronghold-like area, where he is approached by Father Theodore Wallace (Ron Sewer), who attempts to convince Sebastian to join him to seize Lily from Myra since Stefano betrayed him. Sebastian refuses and is banished to a forest outside Union where he meets with Mobius operative Esmeralda Torres (Crash Barrera). Upon reaching her safe house, Torres reveals that she, Kidman, Myra, and Theodore had conspired to break Lily out of STEM and destroy Mobius from within via their chip implants. However, the plan went awry when Theodore became mentally unstable and decided to kidnap Lily for himself. Seeing Theodore as the most immediate threat, Sebastian goes to confront him, but is forced to kill a brainwashed Liam. Upon reaching Theodore, Sebastian is immediately incapacitated when Theodore uses Sebastian's own lingering guilt against him and he falls unconscious. Sebastian is visited by a vision of Myra, who assures him that what happened to Lily was not his fault and that he should focus on saving her. When he wakes up, he finds out that Esmeralda had sacrificed herself to get him to safety and that Theodore has erected his stronghold in the center of Union. Both Sebastian and Yukiko assault Theodore's stronghold, though Yukiko dies in the process. Sebastian is able to confront and defeat Theodore, only for Myra to arrive and kill Theodore herself while warning Sebastian to stay away from her and Lily. Sebastian follows Myra, whose desire to protect Lily has made her insane and obsessed with keeping Lily locked in the STEM for her own \\"safety\\". Myra lashes out at him, forcing him to shoot her, triggering her transformation into a large being called 'The Matriarch', forcing Sebastian to reluctantly battle her. Sebastian defeats the monster, releasing Myra and knocking her back to her senses. He prepares to take Lily out of STEM, but Myra refuses to follow, explaining that as part of the plan to destroy Mobius, she must take Lily's place as the Core of STEM to transmit the implant- destroying signal. Meanwhile, in the real world, Kidman is ordered by the Administrator to eliminate Sebastian. She disobeys him and helps Sebastian and Lily escape the STEM while Myra enacts her plan, killing the Administrator and all Mobius operatives (except Kidman who has removed the microchip from her brain). Now free from Mobius, Sebastian, Lily, and Kidman leave the facility. In a post-credits scene, Sebastian parts ways with Kidman and goes off to live a new life with Lily. Back at the now abandoned Mobius facility, the STEM system mysteriously reactivates itself. Development Shinji Mikami, director of the first game, supervised The Evil Within 2's development Development for The Evil Within 2 began in March 2015, after the team at Tango Gameworks wrapped up the development of the downloadable content for the first game. Director Shinji Mikami stepped down and became game producer and supervised the game's development. Mikami said the development period was quite a bit shorter than it had been for its predecessor.https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-evil-within-2-doesnt-want- to-suffocate-you-wit/1100-6453509/ The director role was assigned to John Johanas, described by Mikami as a person with \\"a lot of talent\\". The story of the game was penned by Syoji Ishimine and Trent Haaga. One of their focuses was to make the game's story easier for players to comprehend and understand, a response to the criticism of the first game where the game's plot gets too complicated by the end. Shifting realities, a feature in the first game, also returns in the sequel but according to Johanas, \\"there‚Äôs a bit more logic to when and how it happens\\". The 2.5:1 aspect ratio featured in the first game was removed due to the mixed response this design choice had received upon its release, even though the team liked it. While the game retains the gore-horror featured dominantly in the original game, the writing team also put effort into creating the game's psychological horror aspect, as the game tells a story that is more personal. In August 2016, Pete Hines, an executive from publisher Bethesda Softworks, revealed that The Evil Within had sold enough copies to warrant a sequel, though he declined to comment on whether a new game is in development. The game was leaked in March 2017, in which a job description for Psycho Break 2, the game's Japanese title, was leaked. An advertisement for the game was prematurely posted on Reddit, several hours prior to the game's official announcement at Bethesda's Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 press conference. Unlike its predecessor, which ran on id Software's id Tech 5 engine, The Evil Within 2 runs on the STEM engine, an offshoot of id Tech that was custom developed by Tango Gameworks for the game. Reception The Evil Within 2 received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Ray Porreca's score of 7/10 on Destructoid said it was \\"Solid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.\\" Mollie L Patterson said on Electronic Gaming Monthly, \\"Though I never expected to ever see a sequel to The Evil Within, we‚Äôve now gotten one, and I‚Äôm rather glad that we did. While The Evil Within 2 isn‚Äôt without problems‚Äîand I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs the kind of game I‚Äôll ever want to play through a second time‚Äîby the time the final credits rolled, I had legitimately enjoyed the adventure I‚Äôd just gone on, and the improvements that Tango Gameworks had tried to bring to the series. Game Informers Suriel Vazquez awarded the game a 7.75/10, stating that \\"The Evil Within 2 is a solid horror game that expands the scope of the series to extend out of the shadow of a titan in the horror genre, even if it sometimes leans heavily on borrowed ideas. Its progression and difficulty curve create a satisfying loop that repays resourcefulness and strategy, but its set pieces and structure don‚Äôt build enough on the many ideas they borrow to make them feel new or interesting. The result is a ride that offers some fun thrills in the moment, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll lose too much sleep over these particular nightmares.\\" Paul Tamburro of Game Revolution awarded it 3.5 out of 5 stars stating that \\"The Evil Within 2 is a worthy sequel that makes a number of bold decisions. For those solely looking for the survival horror thrills of the first game, its spotlight upon combat will likely be a disappointment, as will its introduction of a dull open world. However, there's plenty tucked away in The Evil Within 2 that will appeal to both fans of the original and new players, with it presenting a mix of Mikami's best ideas and John Johanas' new direction. It's certainly not what I was expecting, but in a good way.\\" Alessandro Fillari's 8/10 score on GameSpot stated that \\"Though there's some occasional technical hiccups that result in some particularly frustrating moments and weird pacing issues, this horror sequel elevates the tense and impactful survival horror experience in ways that feel fresh and exciting. What this cerebral horror game does isn't totally new, but it rarely feels routine, and offers plenty of surprises. Coming in at a lengthy and surprisingly packed 15-hour campaign, the sequel does an admirable job of ratcheting up the tension and scares when it needs to, while also giving you the freedom to explore and proceed how you want. It's a tough thing to balance, but The Evil Within 2 does it remarkably well, and in a way that leaves a strong and lasting impression after its touching conclusion.\\" Lucas Sullivan from GamesRadar gave the game a score of 3.5 out of 5 stars saying that \\"Though it doesn't outdo its predecessor, The Evil Within 2 delivers another fun, challenging, tense horror headtrip that should delight fans of the first game.\\" Lucy O'Brien of IGN gave the game 8/10, concluding that \\"The Evil Within 2 is an intense and exhilarating survival horror experience.\\" 80/100 was Joe Donnelly's score on PC Gamer and said it was \\"An intense and thrilling psychological survival horror sequel that improves on its forerunner in almost every way.\\" \\"The Evil Within 2 represents one of the starkest and most astounding turnarounds from a debut title to its sequel that I‚Äôve ever witnessed. It‚Äôs a brilliant horror game, one that understands when to ratchet up tension and when to pull back and let you collect yourself.

The neighbourhood is bordered by the Witwatersberge on the south side and the Apies River on the west side. The neighbourhood extends from the Apies River to Voortrekkers Street. Streets in the neighbourhood are named after early mayors of Pretoria (Venter Street, Malherbe Street, Van Heerden Street, Myburg Street). One of the former mayoral residences is in Capital Park. Capital Park was previously a very popular neighbourhood among Italian as well as Portuguese communities - the Portuguese Church is still in Van Heerden Street (2010). The residential area today is cosmopolitan, with predominantly Afrikaans speaking inhabitants. The CPRTA (Capital Park Residents and Taxpayers Association) functions as residents' association to look after the interests of its residents. Schools in Capital Park include H√∂erskool Langenhoven, Capital Park Primary School, and Laerskool General Jacques Pienaar. Several Afrikaans and English churches are located in Capital Park. Capital Park is centrally located, with Wonderboom Junction, Jacaranda Center, and the Gezina Galleries only being 10 minutes away. Hospitals in the area include Eugene Marais Life Hospital and the Steve Biko Academic Hospital. The climate is subtropical at the slopes of the Witwatersberg (Malherbe and Venter Street). The location, due to the Pretoria National Zoo, offers plenty of bird life. Trouw Street and Flowers Street run through Capital Park and are important lanes between the northeast and western suburbs of Pretoria. Paul Kruger Street serves as the main route between northern suburbs and the Pretoria Central Business Center. Capital Park is commonly known as a favourite neighbourhood for the capital's artist community. Capital Park is about 2 km from the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) and a favourite student district. Capital Park is also home to the terminus of the world- renowned Rovos Rail luxury cruise train, which transports passengers in comfort to Cape Town, Dar es Salaam, Durban, or Victoria Falls. In 2002 local artists found a bust of a woman (Beaula), by local artist Johan Blignaut, \\"illegally\\" in the Apies River. The erection of the bust has enjoyed wide media coverage. The Tshwane Metro Council has notified local artists in writing to remove the bust within 7 days or to accept liability for costs incurred by the Metro Council to remove the image. Resistance by the local community, as well as wide media coverage, ensured that Beaula could acquire a permanent home in Capital Park. However, Beaula disappeared inexplicably in the following year (2003) after the mighty Apies River was in flood. A copy of the original Beaula image was given a permanent resting place next to the Apies River in 2003. The Metro Council's reaction to the placement of the Beaula statue had a positive impact on Capital Park. At the end of November 2002, the Capital Meander Art Trail was established in Capital Park, aiming to promote local artists' art and to establish Capital Park as the \\"city of art\\" of the capital. The art trail consists of a variety of art galleries, coffee houses, the Mimi Coerts Museum of Afrikaans and a wine cellar.

However, this became inadequate for the population, so a new church dedicated to St Augustine was planned. The first sod was cut by Henry Howe Bemrose MP in July 1896 and the foundation stone was laid on 17 October 1896 by Michael Bass, 1st Baron Burton. The architects were Naylor and Sale and the contractors were J.E. Tomlinson and Company of Belgrave Street, Derby. By 1898 the nave had been completed, and this was consecrated on 27 April 1898 by the Bishop of Southwell, Rt. Revd. George Ridding. The south aisle was added in 1905, and the chancel a few years later. The chancel was built by the contractor H. Chattle of Empress Road, Derby, with the oak work by Mattyn and Company of Cheltenham. It was dedicated on 29 October 1910 by the Bishop of Southwell, Rt. Revd. Edwyn Hoskins.

He considered joining the People First Party shortly after its formation in 2000, but remained affiliated with the KMT throughout his time in office. In August 2000, prosecutors searched properties owned by Liao, as he was suspected of selling fake shares of Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation. The investigation was slated to continue at Liao's legislative office in Taipei, but President of the Legislative Yuan Wang Jin-pyng barred such a search. Liao was indicted on charges of graft related to the Chi Mei case in February 2001. In November, separate charges of check fraud were brought against Liao. In 2007, Liao was brought in for questioning on a third case dating back to 1998, involving bribes distributed by the National Chinese Herbal Apothecary Association. He was subsequently indicted and charged with bribery in January 2008. The Taipei District Court sentenced Liao to eight and a half years imprisonment in January 2009. Additionally, his civil rights were suspended for six years. The court also ruled that Liao was to return NT$6 million to the association. Upon appeal to the Taiwan High Court, Liao's sentence was upheld.

The original theatre was an opera house designed by Domenico Antonio Vaccaro. Completed in 1724, it was also known as the Teatro Nuovo sopra Toledo and the Teatro Nuovo de Montecalvario. The theatre specialised in the opera buffa genre and saw the world premieres of hundreds of operas in its heyday. These included fifteen of Cimarosa's operas and seven of Donizetti's. The present theatre is the third to have been erected on the site following its destruction by fire in 1861 and again in 1935. First theatre 1774‚Äì1861 Orefice's opera Lo Simmele which inaugurated the theatre in October 1724 The first theatre was originally owned by Giacinto de Laurentis and Angelo Carasale who had it built on a small garden near the church of Santa Maria della Concezione a Montecalvario. It was designed by Domenico Antonio Vaccaro who had also designed the reconstruction of the church. Prior to the construction of the Teatro Nuovo, the Teatro dei Fiorentini was the only theatre in Naples hosting performances of opera buffa written in Neapolitan dialect. It was, however, very small (seating only 250 people), was lit by only two large torches, and had not been originally built as an opera house. The ever-increasing popularity of the opera buffa genre led to local impresarios opening new theatres to accommodate the new audiences. The Teatro della Pace which opened the same year as the Teatro Nuovo was as small as the Fiorentini and had been converted from a private prose theatre in the home of Prince Tiberio Carafa.DelDonna, Anthony R. (2016). Opera, Theatrical Culture and Society in Late Eighteenth-Century Naples, pp. 7‚Äì9. Routledge. Buelow, George J. (2016). The Late Baroque Era. Vol 4, p. 99. Springer. The Teatro Nuovo was the first theatre in Naples to be purpose- built for staging opera. It had what would become the classic \\"horseshoe\\" shape and was considered to be a marvel of design for the size of the audience it could accommodate on a very small plot of land. With 140 seats in the orchestra stalls and five tiers of thirteen boxes each, it was able to accommodate 1000 spectators. Its capacity, lighting and acoustics led one contemporary commentator to remark that \\"from the impossible was born the possible\\". Vaccaro's plans for the Teatro Nuovo would later serve as the basis for the design of the much larger Teatro San Carlo by Giovanni Antonio Medrano.Certosa e Museo di San Martino. \\"Pianta del Teatro San Carlo\\". Retrieved 12 June 2017 . Carasale and de Laurentis bought the land for their new theatre in March 1724, and seven months later its construction was completed. The Teatro Nuovo was inaugurated on 15 October 1724 with the premiere of Antonio Orefice's comic opera Lo Simmele set to a libretto in Neapolitan dialect by Bernardo Saddumene and dedicated to Michael Friedrich von Althann, the Viceroy of Naples. The theatre was initially run by the impresario Gennaro Donatiello who contracted with Carasale and de Laurentis to pay 650 ducats per year for the right to stage performances there.Capone, Stefano (2007). L'opera comica napoletana (1709-1749), p. 177. Liguori. Cotticelli, Francesco and Maione, Paolo Giovanni (1996). Onesto divertimento, ed allegria de' popoli, p. 139. Ricordi. Comic operas dominated the theatre's repertoire throughout the 18th century, but it also presented prose comedies during that time, which like the operas were mainly written in Neapolitan dialect. Over the 137 years of its existence, the Teatro Nuovo presented hundreds of world premieres, including fifteen operas by Cimarosa, eleven by Piccinni, and seven by Donizetti. In the 19th century, prose theatre began to dominate, although operas were still performed regularly, many of them composed and performed by students at the San Pietro a Majella conservatory.Florimo, Francesco (1880).

Chiurazzi Second theatre 1864‚Äì1935 Crowds at the entrance of the Teatro Nuovo 1900 Ulisse Rizzi, an architect and the owner of the first theatre at the time it burnt down, rebuilt it on the same site. The new theatre's interior was decorated by Fausto Niccolini, the son of the architect and scenographer Antonio Niccolini. It had a larger stage than the previous theatre and increased seating capacity, although one contemporary writer, Pietro Martorana (1819‚Äì1875), observed that the increased number of seats was somewhat to the detriment of the audience's comfort. Under the new theatre's impresario Giuseppe Maria Luzi, comic plays in Neapolitan dialect predominated. Francesco Florimo lamented that the operatic offerings were a \\"musical hybrid\\". Forsaking the traditional Neapolitan opera buffa of its glory days, the theatre presented revivals of Italian operas as well as French and Austrian operettas, cast mostly with inferior singers.Dalbono, Carlo Tito (1876). Nuova guida di Napoli e dintorni, p. 316. Antonio Morano By the late 1800s operatic offerings had become few and far between. Amongst them were Nicola D'Arienzo's comic opera La fiera (with a libretto by Salvatore Di Giacomo) which premiered in 1887 and Mario Morelli's L'amico Francesco staged on 15 March 1895. Morelli was an amateur musician who had rented the theatre at his own expense to present his opera to an invited audience. L'amico Francesco was never performed again but it starred the young Enrico Caruso in the title role and marked his professional debut as an opera singer.Slonimsky, Nicolas and Kuhn, Laura (eds.)

Amadeus Press In 1888 when the actor and his company took up residence, the Teatro Nuovo took its first steps towards a more modern version of Neapolitan dialect theatre and presented both comedy and realist drama. Under its impresario Pasquale Molinari, the theatre secured the exclusive rights to produce many of Eduardo Scarpetta's comic plays, but it also produced the premieres of several dramas by Salvatore Di Giacomo, notably his 1909 Assunta Spina which has been characterised by Italian theatre scholar Andrea Bisicchia as \\"a defining moment in the history of Neapolitan theatre\\" and a manifesto for the teatro d'arte (art theatre) movement.Lezza, Antonia (2007) \\"Salvatore Di Giacomo (1860‚Äì1934)\\". Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies, Vol. 1, pp. 635‚Äì636. Routledge. The Teatro Nuovo closed in 1914 for the duration of World War I. In the interim, Molinari had died, and when the theatre reopened his son-in-law Eugenio Aulicino took over as impresario. In the post-war years he built up a roster of actors that included the young Eduardo De Filippo, his sister Titina and brother Peppino; Tot√≤; and for a short time, Romilda Villani (the mother of Sofia Loren). On the night of 12 February 1935, shortly after the curtain fell on the revue Mille luci, the Teatro Nuovo caught fire and once again burnt to the ground.Festa, Natascia (19 February 2016). \\"¬´Nuovo¬ª dal 1724: le mille vite del teatro pi√π longevo di Napoli\\".

After World War II, a hotel and cinema were built on the site of the old theatre. Attached to the new building was a warehouse which had been carved out of the remains of the old theatre's auditorium. In the early 1980s, the actors Igina Di Napoli and her husband Angelo Montella conceived the idea of resurrecting the Teatro Nuovo by converting the disused warehouse into a new performing space. It was to become a home for experimental theatre and a training ground for young playwrights, actors and directors. Their first full season began in 1985. Di Napoli and Montella ran the theatre as a consortium of small companies until 2010. Ownership then passed to Teatro Pubblico Campano, an organization consisting of the regional and local governments of the Campania Region and theatrical and cultural organizations in the region. Alfredo Balsamo has been the General and Artistic Director of the Teatro Nuovo since 2011 when the Teatro Pubblico Campano took over the theatre. The theatre was refurbished shortly after it passed to the Teatro Pubblico Campano and now has a seating capacity of 248 and a stage 12 metres wide and 7 metres deep.

History A mission church was established on the site of the current church in the 1870s but this became inadequate for the needs of the district. The foundation stone for the new church was laid on 18 October 1884 by George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. The architect was Arthur Coke-Hill and the contractors were Walker and Slater. Construction of the nave, north and south aisles was rapid and it was opened less than one year later on 1 October 1885. The walls were faced externally with Coxbench stone. Internally they were finished with rough stucco with Bath and Handsworth stone dressings. The roofing tiles came from J.C. Edwards of Ruabon, North Wales, and the heating apparatus was installed by Musgrave and Company of Belfast. It was consecrated one week later on 7 October 1885 by the Bishop of Southwell. The chancel was added in 1903-04 and dedicated on 22 March 1904 by the Bishop of Southwell. The oak screen was given in memory of Miss Mary Shaw, by her brothers, Messrs. W.J. and James Shaw, and her sister, Mrs Stuart Thirlby. The pulpit was given in memory of Mr. James Bates of Heyworth Street, by his family. The lectern was given by Mrs. R. Jefferson in memory of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Redfern of Etwall. The oak reredos, choir and clergy stalls, and two oak screens which formed the clergy vestry were designed and executed by Messrs. Jones and Willis of Birmingham. Rust of London provided the green and blue chancel floor tiles.

It corresponds to the zodiacal sign of Capricorn, and overlaps with about the later half of January and approximately early half of February in the Gregorian calendar. In Vedic texts, the Makara month is called Sahasya (IAST: Sahasya), but in these ancient texts it has no zodiacal associations. The solar month of Makara overlaps with its lunar month Magha, in Hindu lunisolar calendars. The Makara marks the month with lengthening day lengths on the Indian subcontinent. It is preceded by the solar month of Dhanu, and followed by the solar month of Kumbha. The start of this month is almost always January 14, the day of the Makara Sankranti festival, and periodically the Kumbh Mela. The Makara month is called Tai in the Tamil Hindu calendar. The ancient and medieval era Sanskrit texts of India vary in their calculations about the duration of Makara, just like they do with other months. For example, the Surya Siddhanta calculates the duration of Vrschika to be 29 days, 10 hours, 45 minutes and 12 seconds. In contrast, the Arya Siddhanta calculates the duration of the Vrschika month to be 29 days, 10 hours, 57 minutes and 35 seconds. Makara (crocodile or half animal-half fish being) is also an astrological sign in Indian horoscope systems, corresponding to Capricorn (astrology).

He was educated at his father estate Wyszki, until 1911. In 1912, he attended the Grabowski school in Stara Wies close to Warsaw. Due to illness he had to leave the school and travelled to France. When he returned he enrolled in the Russian gymnasium in Jelgawa, moving during the war to Smolensk and Yalta, (Crimea), where he graduated in 1918. While at university he formed part of the Arkonia Academic Corporation, one of Polands oldest, largest and most dynamic of academic organizations. When the Germans occupied Crimea he returned to his father's estate and started studying at the Polytechnic School at Riga. He left Riga two months before it was captured by Bolsheviks and went to Berlin and then Dresden.the Central Military Archive (Centralne Archiwum Wojskowe, ul.

He was then sent as a student to the school of technical squadrons (Szwadrony Techniczne) located in the ‚ÄúKosciuszkowski‚Äù sapper training camp. He graduated with excellent grades and became an instructor. Alexander was then commandeered to the II unit of the Army Staff (Intelligence). He left the regiment in October 1920 to continue his studies. He graduated from the Poznan University of Technologyin political science in 1922.the Central Military Archive (Centralne Archiwum Wojskowe, ul.

In 1929 El≈ºbieta and Aleksander had twin daughters, Therese and Sophie. He ended his military career in 1930 as a Second Lieutenant with the 13th Regiment of Wilno Uhlans. During that year his wife died of complications during an operation gone wrong. In 1940, Mohl fled to Portugal on the SS Nyaasa. His two daughters were sent to live with Mary Anne Payne Clews Blumenthal (with whom he was having an affair) at her mansion, La Lanterne, in Brookville, New York. At the time she was still married to her husband George Blumenthal. Mohl was in phone contact with Mary Anne from Portugal, where he was based, until the FBI cut them off. Mohl's brother, Maurice, and his first wife Ada, fled to New York as well. Maurice Mohl's wife reportedly had an affair with Otto Abetz, Hitler's man in Paris. Aleksander is mentioned in intelligence briefings to the US president in regards to a possible coup plot by a ring led by Allen W. Gullion, mainly due to their mutual personal relationships.FDR presendential records, page 19, letter November 1942FDR presendential records, page 59, letter November 1942 Diplomatic career From 1925 to 1927 he served as Secretary of the Marshal of the Senate of the Republic of Poland, Wojciech TrƒÖmpczy≈Ñski.Wojciech TrƒÖmpczy≈Ñski, Zygmunt Kaczmarek, Wydawn. \\"Lega\\", 1993, pages 155-156 He continued serving as Secretary of the Marshal of the Senate for Julian Szyma≈Ñski from 1928 to 1930. From 1930 to 1935 he served a third term as Secretary of the Marshall of the Senate, now under W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz, who had succeeded Szymanski. Mohl's Prussian Baltic aristocratic background was useful to Poland in the years prior to the war in trying to bridge an increasingly difficult relationship with Germany. In those years Hermann G√∂ring frequently visited Poland, \\"ostennsibly to hunt actually to reconnoiter elite sentiment\\".The Nobility of Poland, By Puslowski Xavier Jon, 2011, Published by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. page 528, , Alexander was called upon to accompany G√∂ring on his visits. Towards the end of 1936 Aleksander was appointed to his first assignment abroad as First Secretary of the Polish Embassy in Paris, serving under Ambassador Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz. This was an important promotion for Aleksander. The Polish embassy in France was considered the most important link in the Polish diplomatic network as France was, at the time, considered Poland's main ally. Ambassador Lukasiewicz was a very experienced diplomat and a close associate, and personal friend, of Polands Foreign Minister, Jozef Beck. Aleksander, or \\"Olko\\" as he was nicknamed, was very well liked and made many friends in Paris beyond the diplomatic circles such as Antoine de Saint-Exupery.Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá, Volume 50, Issues 9-12, 1994, RSW \\"Prasa-KsiƒÖ≈ºa-Ruch\\" Ambassador Lukasiewicz said that he was a very precise barometer, feeling every change in the surrounding situation. At some point he was promoted to counselor in Paris.Kultura i jej krƒÖg, Instytut Literacki (Paris, France), Biblioteka Polska w Pary≈ºu, Amis de Kultura (Paris, France), page 152 Before the Germans occupied Paris in 1940, most of the Polish Embassy staff, including Mohl who was embassy counselor at the time, left the city.Polonia zachodnioeuropejska w planach RzƒÖdu RP na emigracji (1940-1944): Akcja Kontynentalna, Tadeusz Panecki, Panstwowe wydawnictwo naukowe, 1986, page 84Na posterunku we Francji, Stanis≈Çaw Zabie≈Ç≈Ço, 1967, page 64 From 1940-1943, Mohl served as head of the delegation of Poland to France at the Embassy in Lisbon, Portugal.Rojek, Wojciech.

Literackie, 2000. p 515 From 1943 to 1944, Aleksander moved to the position of Counselor of the Polish Embassy in Algiers. He became one of the most popular persons in the temporary capital of the Free French Forces, acting as a \\"connector\\" of great value. The diplomats were fond of him, politicians trusted him and even officers of the allied command, normally reluctant with civilians, liked him. The Polish ambassador in Algiers, Kajetan Morawski, was surprised to find that Aleksander, for whom nothing was sophisticated or good enough in Paris, was accepting all the inconveniences in Algiers with cheerfulness and a good mood. Morowski found that for all of Aleksander's cosmopolitan background, (He spoke fluently French, German, English, Russian, Italian and Spanish, and adapted easily to any of those cultures), he had very strong feelings for Poland and was very much a patriot. He was energetic and bustling, and very much preferred to talk than fulfill his bureaucratic duties. When the Germans left Paris, the Polish Embassy was reopened with Kajetan Morawski as ambassador. Aleksander served Morawski as Counseler of the Embassy from 1944 to 1945.Free Europe, Volume 10, 1944, page 144 The war ended and the Western Powers gave into Stalin's demands, withdrawing the accreditation of the Polish government-in-exile.Joseph Retingermemoirs of an eminence grise, Sussex University Press, 1972, page 89 Intelligence officer During the war, Mohl served as an intelligence officer for the Polish government in exile. He is mentioned as a possible source of an intelligence leak from William J. Donovan to the Abwehr in 1942 regarding American war plans in Europe. At the time, US planning was to hold off the US invasion until arms production tilted the war in America's favor, expecting the Soviets to hold off. Mohl held an extensive discussion with Donovan at the time in Washington.Roosevelt's spy games, Washington Times, 2001Roosevelt's Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage, By Joseph E.

He moved to Madrid. He tried mediating between American funds and underinvested Spanish companies. Though a good mediator, he was not a good businessman. He was very generous, loved to live life and did not count its value in a monetary sense.

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles and Seattle Mariners. Early life and education Yacabonis is the son of Maria and James Yacabonis. His grandfather played professional baseball in Cuba. He attended Christian Brothers Academy in Lincroft, New Jersey. He attended Saint Joseph's University, where he played college baseball on the Saint Joseph's Hawks baseball team. Career =Baltimore Orioles= Yacabonis was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the 13th round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft as the 399th pick overall. He signed and spent 2013 with the Aberdeen IronBirds where he was 3‚Äì1 with a 1.52 ERA in 29.2 relief innings pitched. In 2014, he pitched for the Delmarva Shorebirds and Frederick Keys where he compiled a 1‚Äì5 record and 5.03 ERA in 38 games pitched out of the bullpen, and in 2015, he returned to Frederick where he posted a 3‚Äì3 record, 4.02 ERA, and 1.71 WHIP in 43 games pitched. Yacabonis spent 2016 with both Frederick and the Bowie Baysox where he was 2‚Äì4 with a 2.64 ERA in 50 relief appearances, holding hitters to a .216 batting average against. He was promoted to the Norfolk Tides to begin 2017. =2017= Yacabonis was called up to the majors for the first time on June 11, 2017. As he had difficulty finding the strike zone in his first three June 2017 appearances with the Orioles, he was sent back to Norfolk ‚Äî where as closer he turned in a 0.93 ERA and 0.99 WHIP. He was recalled from Norfolk on July 2, 2017, likely to work in middle relief during his second call-up for the Orioles. He attributes his success in 2017 to his command of a certain pitch. As he says: In his first up after being called back from Norfolk, Yacabonis shut down the Milwaukee Brewers on July 3, 2017 for 3.1 innings. He allowed just one run on three hits, striking out two batters. Of his contribution in the game after being sent back down, Showalter said, \\". . Yac was the key. . . we sent him down to get stretched out a little bit and work on some things, shorten up the breaking ball a little bit, and he presented himself well.\\" Yacabonis knocked in the only Orioles' run in the 8‚Äì1 loss by grounding out to second base, which scored Rub√©n Tejada from third in the third inning. He was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk the next day. Yacabonis was recalled September 1, 2017, coming in that day in a scoreless game against the Toronto Blue Jays in the top of 13th inning. He shut down the side to get his first major league win. =2018= After a strong spring training for Yacabonis, where he posted a 3.38 ERA over eight innings, the Orioles optioned him to Triple-A Norfolk March 22, 2018 with the possible intent of developing him into a starting pitcher. Yacabonis had refined his mechanics to take stress off his throwing shoulder. Yacabonis was called up from Triple-A Norfolk to cover the Orioles bullpen April 7, 2018, after the previous night's 14-inning game with the Yankees required nine innings of relief pitching. He was sent back down to Triple-A Norfolk on April 8, 2018, with left-handed pitcher Tanner Scott being called up from there. Yacabonis gave up three earned runs in one inning against the Yankees. Yacabonis was called up from Triple-A Norfolk prior to a May 11 game against Tampa Bay to provide another bullpen arm for the four-game series. After being sent down again to work on his command, he was recalled on June 27 and made his first Major League Baseball career start a day later against the Seattle Mariners. Through seven interim starts with disruption in Norfolk, Yacabonis had posted a 1.99 ERA with a 0.884 WHIP. He had a 3.14 ERA overall in Triple-A through that point in the season. He was called up by the Orioles later in the season. He finished the season with a 0‚Äì2 record in seven starts (12 games). 2019 In 2019 for the Orioles, Yacabonis pitched to a 1-2 record and a 6.80 ERA over 29 games. Yacabonis was designated for assignment by the Orioles on August 14, 2019. He became a free agent following the 2019 season. =San Diego Padres= On December 19, 2019, Yacabonis signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres. Yacabonis did not make a major league appearance with the Padres. =Seattle Mariners= On August 19, 2020, Yacabonis was traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for cash considerations.

The 231,230 acre El Malpais National Conservation Area is a Bureau of Land Management area established in 2001 to protect ‚Äúnationally-significant geological, archaeological, ecological, cultural, scenic, scientific, and wilderness resources surrounding the Grants Lava Flows.‚Äù The Area includes one primitive campground, several small picnic areas, two Wilderness Areas, and opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, and caving. Most of the lands within the Conservation Area, including the Joe Skeen primitive campground and La Ventana Natural Arch, a popular destination, can be reached via NM 117, SE of Grants. The Wilderness Mostly flat, and with elevations averaging 7,200 feet, much of the West Malpais Wilderness consists of large areas of volcanic lava flows. This area of basalt rock is surrounded in the south by open grassland and on the west by pi√±on and juniper forest. The most popular area of the Wilderness is a 6,700-acre kipuka (a Hawaiian term meaning island of fertile ground) in the northern half of the wilderness known as Hole-In-The-Wall, where an island of ponderosa pine stands among the spreading waves of volcanic rock. Hiking is the most common recreational use of the area, with several trails leading to the Hole-in-the-Wall area. The area has no water sources and like all Wilderness Areas, are closed to all mechanized and motorized vehicles, including mountain bicycles. Trips into the Wilderness require a backcountry permit, which can be obtained from the El Malpais Information Center in Grants, or from the BLM Ranger Station on State Road 117. Location and Access Because West Malpais is contiguous with the El Malpais National Monument to the north, the main access to the area is along CR 42, which forms the southern and western border of the Wilderness. The trailhead for hiking into the Hole-in-the-Wall area can be reached via the eastern end of CR 42, which begins at NM 70, approximately 27 miles south of I-40. Visitors can also reach the Wilderness from the western terminus of CR 42, which begins at NM 53, 18 miles SW of I-40. A section of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail runs through the southern half of the Wilderness Area, and can be accessed by a trailhead on CR 42, 22 miles south of N.M. 53.

Parliament, including members of Obote's own party (the UPC, who controlled 74 of 91 seats), voted almost unanimously to back Ochieng's motion, albeit with a range of justifications. The UPC's stance of acceptance, agreed earlier in the day at an emergency meeting of the Cabinet, reversed the position of resistance agreed at a meeting of the full Parliamentary Group on 31 January. In this way, Ochieng's accusations ‚Äì and the fact that they were seemingly considered even by members of the Cabinet to be plausible enough to deserve investigation, contrary to the agreed position of 31 January ‚Äì prompted what has come to be known as the \\"Gold Scandal\\". At the time of the motion, \\"for reasons that are not quite clear\\", Obote was away from Kampala on a tour of the Northern Region, and therefore unable to influence either the Cabinet's decision to back Ochieng's motion or the debate on the floor of the House. On his return, Obote responded by putting Amin on leave for two weeks and establishing a commission of inquiry. He declared a state of emergency, and on 22 February suspended the 1962 constitution, suspended the Presidency of Edward Mutesa II and Vice Presidency of William Nadiope, and moved to purge the UPC, having five Government Ministers arrested (Grace Ibingira, E. B. S. Lumu, B. K. Kirya, Mathias Mbalule Ngobi, and George B. K. Magezi). In April 1966 Obote published a new, interim constitution (Uganda's second). Shortly following a diagnosis of stomach cancer, Ochieng died on 1 June 1966.

It is situated on the east side of the Bahr al Jabal River a short distance north of Bor, South Sudan. Baidit is the county headquarters for Bor West County. History Baidit Payam is named for the village, Baidit (whose name is sometimes combined with an adjoining town, called Padak), where the payam's administrative headquarters are located. During the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983‚Äì2004), Baidit village was the site of a Sudan People's Liberation Army headquarters commanded by Kuol Manyang Juuk, which was located in buildings originally constructed by the Dutch Government to house a medical training center. Demographics Baidit is composed of six bomas: Akayiech, Manydeng, Makol Cuei, Mathiang, Mayen, and Tong. Spellings of these bomas vary considerably, in large part owing to differences of orthographic conventions and, for place-names, specially, the way that Dinka singular nouns ending in a vowel or certain consonants, when followed by an adjective, pronoun, possessive, or a modifying noun (genitive), are pronounced with a nasalized final sound. Thus Mach Deng is pronounced /Manydeng/. A few common alternative spellings follow: Akayiech or Akeyech, Machdeng or Manydeng, Makol-chuei or Makol Cuei or Makolchuei, and Mathieng or Mathiang. According to the Fifth Population and Housing Census of Sudan, conducted in April 2008, Baidit had a combined population of 51,532 people, composed of 26,915 male and 24,617 female residents.The data collected during the Fifth Population and Housing Census of Sudan were to be the primary source of information for decisions about the number and demarcation of electoral constituencies and administrative boundaries in what was then southern Sudan. South Sudanese officials rejected census results for southern Sudan. See . Also, see Demographics of South Sudan. Baidit is home to three major communities. These are Angakuei, Biong, Pathuyith.

History  Imandar Daurey is believed to be created around the 1990s or the 2000s but its popularity began to grow in the 2000s. This is adaptation of an older story, Panchatantra, about a woodcutter who is rewarded by a goddess for his honesty.  Summary  Imandar Daurey is a story about a poor man named Daurey who makes a living from cutting down trees and selling firewood to the market. One day while in the middle of the jungle he saw giant log in the ground. Daurey tries to cut down the log, but when he does so, he loses his axe in the pond. He then starts to cry, complaining about how unlucky his day was. While he was crying a jalpari (mermaid) appears from the pond, offering to help him find his axe. She goes down in the pond then proceeds to offer him a gold axe, asking if it is his axe. Daurey responds, stating that it is not his axe. She then offers him a silver axe, leading to the same response from Daurey as before. Finally she offers him his axe and Daurey says that it is his axe, thanking her for it. The jalpari gets impressed by his honesty, rewarding him with gold and a silver axe which he sells to buy a good house. His neighbor, curious as to how he had managed buy the house, asks him about it. Daurey tells him what had happened, causing his neighbor to see a way to easily make money. The next day he does the same thing as Daurey. The Jalpari appears, offering him a silver axe, and he says it is not his axe. She then offers him a gold axe, which he claims is his.

It corresponds to the zodiacal sign of Sagittarius, and overlaps with approximately the second half of December and about the first half of January in the Gregorian calendar. Other names In Vedic texts, the Dhanus month is called Sahas (IAST: Sahas), but in these ancient texts it has no zodiacal associations. The solar month of Dhanu overlaps with its lunar month Pausha, in Hindu lunisolar calendars. The Dhanu marks the winter season for the Indian subcontinent. It is preceded by the solar month of V·πõ≈õcik‚Äå‚Äå‚Äåa, and followed by the solar month of Makara. The Dhanus month is called Margali in the Tamil Hindu calendar. The ancient and medieval era Sanskrit texts of India vary in their calculations about the duration of Dhanus, just like they do with other months. For example, the Surya Siddhanta calculates the duration of Vrschika to be 29 days, 7 hours, 37 minutes and 36 seconds. In contrast, the Arya Siddhanta calculates the duration of the Vrschika month to be 29 days, 8 hours, 24 minutes and 48 seconds. Dhanurmas or Dhanur Masa is also known by the names Chapa Mas, Kodanda Mas, Karmuka Mas etc. Chapa, Kodanda, Karmuka etc., in Sanskrit are synonyms of Dhanus; meaning a bow. It is the month of margashira and so also called Margazhi masam in Tamil. Lord Sri Krishna says in Bhagavad-gita, 'Maasanam Margashirshoham' ... meaning 'Among the months, I am Margashira'. Dhanurmasa is also called as Shoonya Masa because it is generally advised not to conduct anything other than godly and holy functions. Astrological sign Dhanu is also an astrological sign in Indian horoscope systems, corresponding to Sagittarius (astrology). Etymology and significance This period of month is considered as highly auspicious for Vishnu devotees. Old Hindu scriptures have set apart this month to be completely focused on devotional activities. Other non-devotional activities (such as weddings, purchase of property etc.) are prohibited during this month so that attention can be given exclusively to the worship of God without any diversions. In South India, especially the Vaikunta Ekadasi, which falls during Dhanur Mas, attracts thousands of devotees. Temples conduct special pujas during this period. Sri Krishna in Bhagavad Gita, says ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∏‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§∂‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡•ã‡§π‡§Æ‡•ç 10.35. I manifest more in Margashirsha Maas among the different months in a year. According to tradition, the Gods wake up early in the morning during the month of Dhanurmas. They perform special prayers to Sri Maha Vishnu during the auspicious period of \\"Brahm Muhurta\\", which is one and half hours before sunrise. During this month, devotees offer prayers to the Lord very early in the morning. The month of Dhanurmas is considered a very special month for performing Puja of Vishnu. Dhanurmas Phal Shruti: Worshiping Vishnu on a single day during this auspicious period is equal to worshiping Vishnu with devotion for 1000 years. Every single step taken towards the nearby lake, river etc. for morning dip during this month brings forth merit equal to performing an Ashvamedha Yaga. During this period the sun is in the Sagittarius or \\"‡§ß‡§®‡•Å ‡§∞‡§æ‡§∂‡§ø\\", the period when the sun passes from Sagittarius to Capricorn or \\"‡§Æ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§∂‡§ø\\" is considered as a period of scarcity to the plenty in India. Feeding or giving alms to the deserving poor and Brahmins during this period is believed to confer great merit i.e. Punya. Other uses Dhanus is also the second month in the Darian calendar for the planet Mars, when the Sun traverses the eastern sector of the constellation Sagittarius as seen from Mars.

She was born in Santiago, Chile, and was active during the late 1970s during the time of the Chilean military coup d'etat. She carried out public art interventions in urban areas, often manipulating traffic signs in order to challenge viewers to rethink notions of public space and political agency. Her work has been exhibited in several countries throughout Latin America, and Internationally in places such as Europe, Japan, and Australia. Art movement and involvement in art Rosenfeld's involvement in art happened during the Chilean military coup d'etat period. Under this regime, she utilized her artwork to demonstrate how official power and conflict zones submit bodies to the margins and borders. She wanted to be separate from the guarded spaces of art and its market therefore she used the streets to perform her work, ultimately interrogating political and cultural spaces. With her art, she hoped that she could change the mentality of people by altering history of her country. The initial medium in which she worked was video recording. She then associated herself with Neo- vanguardism and the Escena de Avanzada, a movement of artists and writers that appeared on the Chilean art scene after the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat. In 1979, along with poet Ra√∫l Zurita, sociologist Fernando Balcells, writer/artist Diamela Eltit, and artist Juan Castillo, she formed, CADA (Colectivo de Acciones de Arte) or (Art Actions Collective). CADA is a collective activist and artist group that used interventions and performance to challenge the Pinochet regime in Chile throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She has also been involved with Fluxus, an experimental international interdisciplinary group related to visual arts, music, and literature. Rosenfeld and CADA's work dealt with transforming and intervening in public urban space with the use of symbolism in order to question society's political and authority status. During this period Rosenfeld's work involved performances and video installations. One of her more recent works is titled Mocion de Orden (Motion of Order). This work is a large multimedia installation that was exhibited at the Una Milla de Cruces Sobre el Pavimento, A Mile of Crosses on the Pavement (1979) Rosenfeld is best known for her 'art action' entitled Una milla de cruces sobre el pavimento (A Mile of Crosses on the Pavement).Una Milla de Cruces Sobre el Pavimento, A Mile of Crosses on the Pavement (1979), youtube.com; accessed July 24, 2020. Influences of the social reality that frame societies' routines became the physical foundations of her creative interventions. It was begun in Santiago, Chile in 1979. it is one of Rosenfeld's most famous art action pieces. She altered the lines on the pavement, ultimately creating crosses. With the help of anonymous people on the street, they transformed the painted lines that divide streets into crosses with a perpendicular axis made of white tape. Rosenfeld used straight lines on the pavement as a metaphor for the tightly held control of the Pinochet regime. By altering these often-used markings, she transgresses this subsystem of control and confronts the public with an unexpected subversion of meaning. She converts a minus sign into a plus, to create the + sign, challenging the idea that signs are fixed, static markings of meaning. The work itself was a performance piece that disrupted every day traffic under the Pinochet regime.

After immigrating to the United States, she became a successful merchant of Woodville, Mississippi. Beaumont was the author of the autobiography, Twelve Years of My Life, and A Business Woman's Journal, which documented part of her career. After her return to England, she died there in 1892. Early years and education Betty Bentley was born in Lancastershire, England, 9 August 1828. She was the only child of Joseph Bentley, the educational reformer of England. The father organized and conducted a society for \\"the promotion of the education of the people,\\" and wrote and published 33 books to improve the methods of education, but he allowed his daughter to acquire little formal education, taking her from school at age 10, and employing her in his business to copy his manuscripts, correct proof and attend lectures. He also showed her a sum of the expenses she had been to him in the 10 years of her life. It seemed a large amount, and so as to be any further expense, she learned the milliner's trade. Her propensity for learning was exceptional, but her opportunity for study was limited. Career She married Edward Beaumont and they emigrated seven years later. They lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for five years and, on because of Edward's health they moved to Woodville, Mississippi in 1854, after her husband was hired to work as a machinist of the railroad. The failing health of her husband and the needs of seven children prompted her to find work, and she opened a general store in 1855. She exchanged cotton, sheep and other products for supplies, and she resold the goods from her store. She also hired young women to work as army hat milliners at her factory. The start of the American Civil War, six year later, and the state of feeling in a southern town toward suspected abolitionists were described in Beaumont's Twelve Years of My Life (T. B. Peterson and Brothers. Philadelphia, 1887), a two volume autobiography of her life covering the period of 1854 through 1866. This is a story of twelve years passed by a Northern woman in Woodville, writing in a chatty style, and with frankness that carries conviction. From the beginning of her years in the south with husband and children, she had to battle with the Southern prejudice against a Yankee. Her narrative was graphic in its varied experience of keeping store, raising fruits and vegetables, and being suspected of being an abolitionist. Incidents of Yellow fever were also well-described. Few women in that time wrote about the Ku Klux Klan but Beaumont stated, \\"... [it] was probably organized for the sake of enforcing law and order during this period of anarchy, but, having been joined by many reckless characters, it in turn has grown into a perfect scourge.\\" Her varied experiences during a period of historical interest are given in A Business Woman's Journal (T. B. Peterson and Brothers, Philadelphia, 1888), covering the period of her life from 1866 through 1876. That book graphically explains the financial state of the cotton-growing region of the South during the years immediately succeeding the Civil War, the confusion consequent upon the transition from the credit system to a cash basis, and the condition of the suddenly-freed Afro-Americans. Beaumont's books were valuable because they documented a period that quickly passed. Her style was simple and unpretending. She was one of the hard-working business women of the day who demonstrated independence, self-sacrifice, and tenacity. She died in England, 6 September 1892 and was buried there. A memorial marker in her honor is located at Evergreen Cemetery in Woodville.

Quao was the founding principal of the Keta Secondary School in Keta, Ghana, started in 1953. He was described by independent observers as part of \\"diminishing survivors of an era, which many consider to have been high-noon of quality and dedication in the civil service.\\"  Early life and education  Quao was born at Adawso in the Eastern Region on 21 November 1915 where his father Daniel James Quao of La was based as a general commodities merchant.

It corresponds to the zodiacal sign of Aquarius, and overlaps with about the second half of February and about the first half of March in the Gregorian calendar. In Vedic texts, the Kumbha month is called Tapas (IAST: Tapas), but in these ancient texts it has no zodiacal associations. The solar month of Kumbha overlaps with its lunar month Phalguna, in Hindu lunisolar calendars. The Kumbha marks the end of winter for the Indian subcontinent. It is preceded by the solar month of Makara, and followed by the solar month of Mƒ´na. The solar month is significant because it inspires the name of the 12-year cycled Kumbha Mela, where Hindu pilgrims gather by tens of millions to one of four pilgrimage sites, in the weeks before it starts. The Kumbha month is called Masi in the Tamil Hindu calendar. The ancient and medieval era Sanskrit texts of India vary in their calculations about the duration of Kumbha, just like they do with other months. For example, the Surya Siddhanta calculates the duration of Kumbha to be 29 days, 19 hours, 41 minutes and 12 seconds. In contrast, the Arya Siddhanta calculates the duration of the Kumbha month to be 29 days, 19 hours, 24 minutes and 0 seconds. Kumbha is also an astrological sign in Indian horoscope systems, corresponding to Aquarius (astrology). Kumbha is also the sixth month in the Darian calendar for the planet Mars, when the Sun traverses the eastern sector of the constellation Aquarius as seen from Mars.

Biography Lyudmila Vladimirovna Erarskaya was a Russian actress who worked in the Moscow theater created by N. K. Nezlobina, in pre- Revolutionary Russia. She was the lover-muse of poet Sophia Parnok from 1916 to 1926, and the inspiration for Parnok's adaptation of the libretto, Almast. During the war years, she and Parnok lived in the Crimea in the town of Sudak and Erarskaya staged productions to entertain the intellectual community who were living there, such as Adelaida Gertsyk, Eugenia Gertsyk, Alexander Spendiarov, and Maximilian Voloshin. She also joined the Federal Art Workers Union, becoming its secretary, while simultaneously heading the theater section for the Ministry of Education in Sudak. She staged benefits for the Sudak High School and performed plays written by the community for the soldiers fighting in the area. Returning to Moscow in 1921, she suffered a serious bout of tuberculosis in 1923 and in January 1925, suffered a mental breakdown and was hospitalized for a year. By the time of her release, she had developed a friendship with Parnok's friend, Olga Tsuberbiller which would last throughout her life. From the 1930s until her death, Erarskaya performed at the Moscow Puppet Theater. She was the sister of the opera singer, Vera Erarskaya ().

The larvae of this fly mine the leaves of a range of vegetables and weeds, but seem to favour plants in the families Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae and Solanaceae. Description Eggs of L. sativae measure approximately and are translucent and whitish. The larvae are legless grubs, with no head capsule. They are translucent at first, but become yellowish-orange in later instars. The pupae are oval and slightly flattened and vary in colour from yellowish-orange to a darker golden brown when the adults are nearly ready to emerge. The adults are up to long, with females being larger than males; the face, frons, third segment of the antenna and scutellum are yellow, and the mesothorax and abdomen are black, although the edges of some plates on the abdomen are yellow. This unique mesonotum is useful in distinguishing L. sativae from their close relatives L. trifolii. The limbs are brown with yellow femora and coxa. The flight mechanism of this insect is of interest, as it makes partial use of the unusual mechanism of clap and fling, mainly employed by very small insects such as thrips. L. sativae uses the mechanism only on the outer part of the wing to increase lift by some 7% when hovering. Distribution L. sativae occurs in the southern part of the United States, in Central America and in much of South America. It is sometimes detected in more northerly parts of the United States having been transported there in plant material, but it is unable to survive in cold weather (apart from in glasshouses). Host range The larvae of Liriomyza sativae mine the leaves of a number of plants grown as vegetables as well as many weeds, with forty plants from ten families acting as hosts in Florida. Plants in the families Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae and Solanaceae are often infested, and vegetable crops affected include beans, eggplant, potato, pepper, tomato, squash and watermelon. Celery is also attacked, but to a lesser extent than by the closely related American leaf miner (Liriomyza trifolii), and wild plants that act as host include Solanum americanum and Bidens alba. Life cycle The female lays eggs inside the leaf tissues of a susceptible plant, creating small puncture holes. The developing larva feeds on the leaf tissue, creating a tunnel between the upper and lower surfaces as it advances. This starts small but gets wider as the larva increases in size. After three instars, the larva cuts a slit, usually in the upper leaf surface, and falls to the ground where it pupates. At , the larval stage lasts for about eight days with a similar period for the pupal stage, whereas at , the whole cycle takes twenty-five days. A female may lay several hundred eggs over the course of her life-span of a month. Control Leaf miners in general are kept under control by their natural enemies. However, in the mid-twentieth century, L. sativae became a serious pest of tomatoes in Florida, having been a minor problem before, when use of insecticides (DDT and BHC) proved more lethal to the braconid wasps that parasitised them than to the other insects the pesticides were designed to control. In addition, the leaf miners quickly developed resistance to various insecticides used against them. Where a crop is vulnerable, some cultivars may be more susceptible to attack than others. Growing a crop in close proximity to weeds, or adjacent to a crop like cotton where leaf miners are already present, may result in the pest insects moving in to the new crop. With insecticides not always being effective, various management strategies have been attempted to control the leaf miners, one possibility being the application of entomopathogenic nematodes in aqueous suspension under humid conditions.

During the Middle Ages the fable was modified by the introduction of a hawk as an additional character, followed by a change in the moral drawn from it. The Phaedrus version The first appearance of the fable is in the collection of Phaedrus (Book 1.31).Christopher Smart, The Fables of Phaedrus, translation by Christopher Smart, London 1913 It is an illustration of political foolishness and tells how doves are so terrified by attacks on them by a kite that they agree to its suggestion that he should be elected their king and protector. They only realise their mistake when the kite begins to prey on them as its royal prerogative. After Phaedrus‚Äô work was lost sight of during the Middle Ages, a new version of the fable was created and it was not until after rediscovery of his original text during the Renaissance that some later collections followed his telling. Samuel Croxall, harking back to a series of recent changes of regime, commented on how ‚Äúmany, with the Doves in the Fable, are so silly that they would admit of a Kite rather than be without a king‚Äù.Fables of Aesop and Others, pp. 29-30, London 1732. Two pages later, Croxall goes on to mention that he has followed the sense of Phaedrus ‚Äúin every fable of which he has made a version‚Äù (p.32). The hawk, the kite and the pigeons During the Middle Ages new versions of the fable developed in Latin, of which Odo of Cheriton recorded several at the end of the 12th century. One of these is a variant of The Frogs Who Desired a King in which the frogs have elected a log to rule over them and, when that is perceived as of no value, choose a snake instead and are eaten by it. Another concerns chickens, or else birds generally, who elect a dove to be their ruler because it is mild and will do them no harm; but when it is perceived as lacking authority, they choose a kite in its place and are then preyed upon by it.Fables 1b, 1c and 1d In the version of Romulus Anglicus, doves who are living in a state of general threat elect a falcon as their protector,Fable 20 while according to Walter of England the doves are at war with the kites and choose a hawk to defend them.Fable 22 The latter story ends with the detail that the hawk kills many more of them than had perished formerly and concludes with the advice that the remedy should not make a bad situation worse. Versions of Walter‚Äôs story were perpetuated in English by William Caxton and Roger L'Estrange.Wikisource Elsewhere in Europe it formed the basis of Neo-Latin poems by Hieronymus Osius Milvus et columbae (Fable 17) and Pantaleon Candidus.Milvius et columbae (Fable 132) The fable was also adapted by John Hawkesworth into his reflective political poem, \\"The Danger of trusting Individuals with exorbitant Power\\".The Gentleman's Magazine, vol.11 (1741), p.379 In that, the king of the doves prays to Jove for help against a marauding kite and is changed in form to a more powerful bird of prey. After his victory, however, the king becomes an even worse tyrant in his turn. The political moral that Hawkesworth drew from this was similar to Croxall's in requiring a democratic system of checks and balances: > :Wrongs to redress, ne‚Äôer arm alone your friend, :But cloth‚Äôd in equal Might > his steps attend.

Secretaria da Justi√ßa e da Defesa da Cidadania. 2014.FAQ on health and sexual diversity: The basics. World Health Organization. 2016. Overview In the Western world, generally simple classifications are used to describe sexual orientation (heterosexuals, homosexuals and bisexuals), gender identity (transgender and cisgender), and related minorities (intersex), gathered under the acronyms LGBT or LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/transsexual people, and sometimes intersex people); however, other cultures have other ways of understanding the sex and gender systems.Gender diversity in Indonesia: Sexuality, Islam and queer selves. 2010. Over the last few decades, some sexology theories have emerged, such as Kinsey theory and queer theory, proposing that this classification is not enough to describe the sexual complexity in human beings and, even, in other animal species. For example, some people may feel an intermediate sexual orientation between heterosexual and bisexual (heteroflexible) or between homosexual and bisexual (homoflexible). It may vary over time, too, or include attraction not only towards women and men, but to all the spectrum of sexes and genders (pansexual). In other words, within bisexuality there exists a huge diversity of typologies and preferences that vary from an exclusive heterosexuality to a complete homosexuality (Kinsey scale).Beyond Heterosexual, Bisexual, and Homosexual: A Diversity in Sexual Identity Expression. Archives of Sexual Behavior. 2016. Sexual diversity includes intersex people, those born with a variety of intermediate features between women and men. It also includes all transgender and transsex identities which do not frame within the binary gender system and, like sexual orientation, may be experienced in different degrees in between cisgender and transsexuality, such as genderfluid people.Theorizing Gender Diversity: Current trans, future directions. University of Huddersfield. 2013. Lastly, sexual diversity also includes asexual people, who feel disinterest in sexual activity; and all those who consider that their identity cannot be defined, such as queer people. Socially, sexual diversity is claimed as the acceptance of being different but with equal rights, liberties, and opportunities within the Human Rights framework. In many countries, visibility of sexual diversity is vindicated during Pride Parades.Pride Weekend events celebrate gender and sexual diversity in Oxford. The Daily Mississippian. 17 may 2017.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The church was built in the 15th century on the site of an earlier church.'Ashcott', in A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 8, the Poldens and the Levels, ed. Robert Dunning (London, 2004), pp. 13-25. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/som/vol8/pp13-25 [accessed 11 June 2017]. The building was probably carried out between 1456 and 1492 and bears the arms of John Selwood the Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey at the time. In 1831 the nave was widened as part of a Victorian restoration. It has since deteriorated with the floor being damaged by water. The vestry roof needs replacing and the tower and parapets need masonry repairs. Therefore the building has been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register. The Polden Wheel parish and benefice is within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture The church consists of a three-bay nave with a south porch. The two-bay chancel includes an organ loft. The two-stage west tower is supported by diagonal buttresses. The south window has stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe. The Norman font has a circular bowl on a cylindrical stem.

He is the current head coach and director of football of Hong Kong Premier League club Kitchee. Chu holds an AFC ‚ÄúPro‚Äù License coaching certification. Playing career Born in Hong Kong, Chu played for Hong Kong First Division clubs Sea Bee and Sing Tao during his playing career. While playing for Sing Tao, Chu lifted the Viceroy Cup twice, during the 1994-95 and 1996-97 seasons. Coaching career Following retirement from playing, Chu took over the managerial position at Fukien in 2001. Despite working with a limited budget, Fukien were able to stave off relegation from First Division during Chu's first three years at the club while occasionally scoring upset victories over table toppers Happy Valley and Sun Hei. During his tenure, he discovered and signed talent players such as Tong Kin Man, Zhang Chunhui and Wong Chin Hung. After a disappointing 8th place finish during the 2004-05 season, Fukien were not originally relegated from the First Division. However, the club chose to voluntarily relegate themselves to the Second Division and Chu left the club. In 2006, Chu joined Kitchee as a coach. Players such as Ngan Lok Fung, Li Ngai Hoi, Tsang Kin Fong trained under his tutelage at Kitchee's academy and later became professional footballers. After the departure of Dejan Antoniƒá on 27 December 2007, Chu was asked to become the caretaker. His managerial debut for Kitchee came on 11 January 2008 which resulted in a 1-1 draw against Eastern. On 14 November 2013, manager √Älex G√≥mez suddenly resigned his position. Chu and Cheng Siu Chung were named co- caretakers of the club until the end of the 2013-14 season. Both Chu and Cheng were responsible for leading Kitchee to an undefeated season and the league title. On 5 March 2016, history was repeated as Abraham Garc√≠a suddenly resigned as manager of Kitchee. Chu was named caretaker for the remainder of the season. Ahead of the 2016-17 season, Chu was named the permanent manager as well as Director of Football for the club. Kitchee were rewarded for their decision as Chu managed the first team to a domestic treble, capturing the Premier League, the Hong Kong FA Cup and the Senior Shield. The only blemish on their historic season was a 2017 AFC Champions League qualifying playoff round loss to Ulsan Hyundai. Kitchee had taken the Korean club to penalties but came up just short of qualifying for the Champions League group stage for the first time. For his achievements, Chu won the Hong Kong Coach of the Year award for 2017. On 3 July 2019, Chu stepped down from his head coaching duties at Kitchee. On 11 August 2019, Chu was appointed as an assistant to Hong Kong head coach Mixu Paatelainen until the end of the year. On 23 March 2020, Chu was named as caretaker of Kitchee until the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season following Bla≈æ Sli≈°koviƒá's decision to step down as head coach.

Apart from this curious feature, it's by far less important central force problem than that of the Keplerian inverse square force system.  Description  The potential energy function of an inverse square potential is V(r) = -\\\\frac{C}{r^2}, where C is some constant and r is the Euclidean distance from some central point. If C is positive, the potential is attractive and if C is negative, the potential is repulsive. The corresponding Hamiltonian operator \\\\hat{H}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}},\\\\hat {r}) is \\\\hat{H} = \\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}}^2}{2m} - \\\\frac{C}{\\\\hat{r}^2}, where m is the mass of the particle moving in the potential.  Properties  The canonical commutation relation of quantum mechanics, [\\\\hat{x}_i,\\\\hat{p}_i] = i\\\\hbar, has the property of being invariant in a scaling \\\\hat{p}_i' = \\\\hat{p}_i/\\\\lambda, and \\\\hat{x}_i' = \\\\lambda\\\\hat{x}_i, where \\\\lambda is some scaling factor. The momentum \\\\mathbf{p} and the position \\\\mathbf{x} are vectors, while the components p_i,x_i and the radius r are scalars. In an inverse square potential system, if a wavefunction \\\\psi (r) is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian operator \\\\hat{H}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}},\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}), it is also an eigenfunction of the operator \\\\hat{H}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}}',\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}'), where the scaled operators \\\\hat{p}_ {i}' and \\\\hat{x}_{i}' are defined as above. This also means that if a radially symmetric wave function \\\\psi (r) is an eigenfunction of \\\\hat{H} with eigenvalue E, then also \\\\psi (\\\\lambda r) is an eigenfunction, with eigenvalue \\\\lambda^2 E. Therefore, the energy spectrum of the system is a continuum of values. The system with a particle in an inverse square potential with positive C (attractive potential) is an example of so-called falling-to- center problem, where there is no lowest energy wavefunction and there are eigenfunctions where the particle is arbitrarily localized in the vicinity of the central point r=0.

The locomotive is a replica of the final 'Patriot' class locomotive to be built, 5551. The original locomotive was built in May 1934, and withdrawn in June 1962 (it was scrapped that October). Unlike the original engine, which never received a name, the replica will be named \\"The Unknown Warrior\\"; the name was chosen by public poll. All of the original un-rebuilt LMS Patriot Class locomotives were withdrawn by November 1962 and the whole class was withdrawn by December 1965 with none of the engines (un-rebuilt or rebuilt) surviving into preservation. Original engine The original 5551/45551 was built at Crewe Works in May 1934 and unlike many other members of its class which were given names, it alongside nine other class members was not named. Sheds that it was allocated to over the years included: Crewe North (5A), Carlisle Upperby (12B), Camden (1B), Willesden (1A) and Edge Hill (8A). Edge Hill was the last shed it was allocated to, being transferred there in June 1961 and remaining there for twelve months until withdrawal. It was also one of thirty four members of its class to be kept in its original unrebuilt condition prior to its final withdrawal in June 1962, its final working life was twenty eight years and one month. It was later cut up for scrap in October of the same year at its birthplace Crewe Works. Replica =Overview= The LMS-Patriot Project, a registered charity in England and Wales ( 6502248 / No. 1123521), is constructing a replica locomotive at the West Shed, an engineering base for the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust, at the Midland Railway ‚Äì Butterley. The project was inspired by the success by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust which built the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado, and it was decided to construct another long lost class of engine, in this case the LMS Patriot Class. Like Tornado, The Unknown Warrior is being built with differences as the plan is to run the completed engine on the mainline, so one main difference being the modifications to the tender so that more water and less coal can be carried. It is also planned to have an entirely British-built boiler constructed for the engine which is ongoing. the project engineering update showed that the engine has had its wheels fitted and also the brake system, pistons, valves, motion plus boiler are all being worked on. In November it was announced by the group who were building \\"The Unknown Warrior\\" that there had been a few problems arising with the Royal British Legion who were supporting the construction of the engine, and with deep regret it was announced that the RBL could no longer support the loco group which also meant that the RBL's crest above the engines nameplates would have to be removed. A new set of crests would be placed above the engines nameplates as a result but the RBL will still support the patriot project and vice versa as its still planned for the completed engine to be known as \\"The National Memorial Steam Engine\\". In October 2018 the Llangollen Railway, where the locomotive had been assembled to date, announced that they were no longer able to build 5551, the decision being made due to the length of the list for the railways own locomotives that needed overhauls and repairs undertaking alongside other new build loco projects at the line including 6880 Betton Grange. The locomotive is currently at PRCLT's west shed on the Midland Railway near Butterly, An invitation to tender had been sent to four contractors who have expressed interest. The Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust being chosen as they were deemed to best fit the requirements of 5551's board. Construction of the engine's boiler is now being undertaken at Heritage Boiler Steam Services Ltd in Liverpool. =Name, number and liveries= The chassis of The Unknown Warrior inside the shed at Llangollen, the firemans side of the cab was painted in BR Lined Green. The Unknown Warrior's driver side nameplate with the RBL (Royal British Legion) crest placed above the nameplate. The Unknown Warrior's drivers side nameplate with the new crest placed above it replacing the RBL's crest which needed to be removed. 5551's drivers side cabside painted in its former LMS colours of crimson lake. The original 5551/45551 never carried a name during its career under LMS & BR ownership, a competition was set up to choose a name for the new engine with examples of nameplates being: Patriot, Hero, Remembrance, Wilfred Owen, British Legion and The Falklands. Alongside names based on regiments, the military & war heroes there were other names entered into the competition which included: Henry Fowler, Winston Churchill, Sir Edward Elgar, Fred Dibnah, Robert Riddles, Baby Scot (nickname for class), Jack Mills (Great Train Robbery), Crewe & Llangollen. Following a public vote to decide on the engines' name, the engine was named \\"The Unknown Warrior\\", after the tomb in London which holds an unidentified soldier who was killed on the battlefront during the First World War. It was also decided for the engine to carry the Royal British Legion's crest above its nameplates. Following a request by the RBL their crest had to be removed from the engine, a replacement crest was unveiled during a recent event in Crewe. The liveries that the original Patriots wore included: LMS Crimson Lake, LMS Black, BR Black & BR Green. For a while during the locomotive's construction, the engine wore crimson lake on the left side of its cab and BR Green on the right, this being to give an idea to the public of what it would look like in either livery when completed and running. It was announced in November 2016 during the Patriot Group's annual meeting at Crewe Heritage Centre that the first livery that \\"The Unknown Warrior\\" would wear on completion would be LMS Crimson Lake, with the three remaining liveries applied at later dates. =Project launch= The project was formally launched at the Llangollen Patriot Gala in April 2008, by the project's first commercial sponsor, John Buxton, Managing Director of Cambrian Transport. The Frames Appeal was also announced at the gala and a membership scheme was later launched. =Project milestones=           * https://www.lms-patriot.org.uk/engineering/2018-05-10/engineering-date- may-2018-2018 Engineering Update, May 2018  * https://www.lms- patriot.org.uk/engineering/2018-07-01/45551-boiler-update The Unknown Warrior boiler update  https://www.lms-patriot.org.uk/news/2018-08-06/inner- firebox-trial-fitted Inner Firebox trial fitted * https://www.railadvent.co.uk/2018/10/llangollen-railway-to-stop-work-on-steam- locomotive-no-45551-the-unknown-warrior.html Llangollen Railway stop work on 45551  https://www.lms-patriot.org.uk/news/2018-11-12/simon-weston-cbe- unveils-crest-unknown-warrior Simon Weston unveils crest * https://www.lms- patriot.org.uk/news/2019-08-13/5551-unknown-warrior-moves-west-shed Unknown Warrior moves to Midland Rly =Construction= Although most parts that are being manufactured for \\"The Unknown Warrior\\" are brand new, a number of parts off fellow preserved engines will also be used. An example of parts that will be used in the construction of the Patriot include the leading front wheelset from LMS 8F 2-8-0 no 48518, a set of LMS Fowler Tenders (both of which being from Woodham Brothers scrapyard at Barry Island) are also going to be used in the project. Examples of new parts that will be constructed for \\"The Unknown Warrior\\" alongside the frame include the driving wheels and the second Fowler tender (the first having usable parts but not fit for re-use itself due to corrosion). Frames On 31 March 2009, two frame plates were cut at Corus Group plc Steel, Cradley Heath in the West Midlands. Measuring 39 ft in length 4 ft high and 1 1/8 in thick (28 mm), the frame plates were then taken to the Boro Foundry, at Lye, West Midlands, for machining and drilling, before being taken to the Llangollen Railway Works where assembly is in progress. The dragbox has been fitted to the frames, the front buffer beam fitted, the bogie bolster has been cast and has been fitted, all five of the five frame stretchers have been cast and are fitted to the frames. Wheels In September 2010, the first driving wheel was cast at the Boro Foundry, using the pattern made for LMS Jubilee Class 45699 Galatea. The two classes share the same size 6'9\\" driving wheels. The six new driving wheels have been cast by The Boro Foundry Stourbridge and machined and assembled by the South Devon Railway, who machined and fitted the plain axles, crank axle, tyres, and crank pins. The six driving axle boxes have been cast by Johnson Porter of Stourbridge, machined at FHT Southam Warwicks and final machined and fitted to the wheels at Tyseley Locomotive Works. Cylinders The three cylinders have now been cast and machined and were fitted to the frames during January 2015. This is the first use of polystyrene patterns (made by Premier Patterns of Smethwick), for locomotive cylinders which were cast at Coupe Foundry Preston and machined at Harco Engineering of Brierley Hill. The motion girders, motion brackets, cylinder covers and slidebar have now been fitted and sandboxes fabricated. Bogie All the components for the bogie have been manufactured and it is being assembled at Tyseley Locomotive Works with completion scheduled for November 2015. The remaining wheelset was assembled by the South Devon Railway in Buckfastleigh Devon. The locomotive has become a 4-6-0 now that the bogie is completed. Tender An ex LMS Fowler tender that remained at Woodham Brothers Barry Scrapyard and was later stored in the ex EWS wagon depot, was secured for use with 'The Unknown Warrior'. The first tender provided the group with the three wheel-sets they needed for the engine's new tender as well as two sets of axle boxes, the other four not being usable due to damage alongside the salt air at Barry Island causing corrosion. The springs despite being exposed to the elements and salt air were fit for reuse and were removed for refurbishment at Rowan Springs in Rotherham. The frames, however, were in very poor condition so they alongside the other unusable parts were cut up and sent for scrap. The Project later purchased a second tender from the East Lancs Railway, Bury. The frame plates were in good enough condition to be used along with two of its axle boxes, (the remaining two acquired with the engine's tender not being usable and the two missing axle boxes are now in use with another engine). Alongside the acquisition of the second tender which provided the society with two more usable axle boxes they also now had two spare tender wheel sets for use in the future when required. The remaining two axle boxes need to be either acquired from another donor tender or manufactured from new. New drawings have also been produced to help in the construction of the engine's tender as it is planned to be built slightly wider than the originals to enable an increase in water capacity from 3,500 gallons to 3,900 gallons. The amount of coal that the engines would have carried in steam days will be reduced to aid in the increase of the water capacity. The water-scoop will also be removed. Higher water supplies for engines being a recommendation now due to there being no water trough's left on the mainline and very few water cranes, except at certain locations like Hellifield and Appleby. Boiler At The LMS Patriot Project's 2010 AGM on 14 November, it was announced that the boiler for 'The Unknown Warrior' would be built by L&NWR; Heritage at Crewe. The new boiler will be of traditional construction with a copper firebox. A fundraising campaign for the boiler for ¬£1/2million has been launched. The smokebox and front tubeplate have been manufactured and were fitted to the locomotive in July 2013. The copper firebox was under construction at L&NWR; Heritage at Crewe and was expected to be complete by the end of 2015, with construction of the boiler proper scheduled to begin in January 2016 with completion scheduled for the end of 2016. On 9 May 2017, L&NWR; Heritage informed The LMS Patriot Project that it had decided to end all sub-contract work, and would not be completing the boiler. L&NWR; Heritage did a little more work on the boiler, culminating in riveting the foundation ring to the inner firebox. The newly-formed Heritage Boiler Steam Services Ltd. was selected to complete the boiler, and on 30 November 2017 the partially- completed boiler was moved to HBSS' new facility. Miscellaneous parts Much of the engine's motion has been reclaimed from scrapped LMS Jubilee Class locomotives and will be refurbished over the next year. A new connecting rod has been forged and machined and other items are currently being sourced. There have been a number of parts offered to the project as well, such as 4 original LMS buffers from a scrapped crane at Ruddington (GCR N), original LMS lamps, a genuine whistle, the surviving chimney from 45539 E C Trench and many other smaller components. The replica engine unlike the original will be fitted with air brakes, however its primary brakes will remain as vacuum. =Completion= The completion date was intended to be 2018 with a formal dedication planned for the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. That target was not met. It was later estimated that the locomotive might be in steam by late 2020. The engine, like 60163 Tornado and 6880 Betton Grange, is being built for mainline running References See also * Steam locomotives of the 21st century  LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado  Pennsylvania Railroad 5550  GWR 6800 Class 6880 Betton Grange External links * Engineering news  Project news * The Unknown Warrior on ITV news * Dedication of the engine's frames by the Royal British Legion * The Unknown Warrior's crest unveiling 4-6-0 locomotives Steam locomotives of the 21st century Individual locomotives of Great Britain Steam locomotives of Great Britain ","title":"LMS Patriot Class 5551 The Unknown Warrior"},{"id":"54279445","text":"Arhopala lurida is a species of butterfly belonging to the lycaenid family.

Early life and family  Nicholas Timothy Clerk was born on 3 March 1930 in Adawso in the Eastern Region of Ghana. His father, Carl Henry Clerk (1895‚Äì1982), an agricultural educator, journalist, editor and Presbyterian minister, was the fourth Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1950 to 1954 and the Editor of the Christian Messenger, the newspaper of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana from 1960 to 1963. Nicholas Clerk's mother, Martha Ayorkor Quao (1911‚Äì1989) hailed from La and Ga-Mashie.

He was replaced by Peter Shoulder ‚Äì lead guitarist Luke Morley's bandmate in The Union ‚Äì and was later \\"given the all-clear\\" in November. The band's performances at Loud Park Festival and the Brooklyn Bowl in 2014 were recorded, in addition to a rehearsal session on 4 November at RAK Studios in London, for release on All You Can Eat. The RAK Studio session was included as the \\"starter\\" of the set, the Brooklyn Bowl performance as the \\"main course\\", and the Loud Park set as part of the \\"dessert\\" disc, which also featured a documentary about the recording of Wonder Days and footage from RAK Studios and the Brooklyn Bowl. Some editions of the album contained the Loud Park recordings as a separate disc, while all three were also released separately in the UK on 12\\" vinyl. Reception Reviewing the album for Bravewords, Mark Gromen described All You Can Eat as \\"a worthy introduction\\" to the band's 2015 tenth studio album Wonder Days, praising the collection's \\"passionate, storytelling lyrics, slide and reverb guitar, plus an amazingly clear production\\". Gromen concluded his review by proposing that \\"You'd be hard pressed to find a more consistent, bluesy hard rock band over the last 2+ decades\\", awarding the album a rating of 8.5 out of 10. Essi Berelian of Classic Rock claimed that All You Can Eat \\"will provide fans ample opportunity to gorge themselves stupid, over and over again\\".

Released on Bandcamp on February 16, 2017, the 16-song album was produced by Jovi under his pseudonym, Le Monstre. 16 Wives was recorded, mixed, and mastered at New Bell Music Studios in Yaound√©, Cameroon, and released on his record label New Bell Music. The album was listed as a best-seller on Bandcamp during its first week of sales, and released on iTunes and other digital platforms on February 24, 2017.  Background and promotion  16 Wives contains lyrics in Pidgin, English, French, Douala, and Ngemba. The album follows the style of Jovi's previous 5 EPs and 2 LPs, which he calls \\"Mboko\\", characterized by mixing traditional African rhythms and instrumentation (such as Bikutsi) with contemporary genres such as hip-hop, RnB, pop, and electronic. On November 16, 2016, Jovi released \\"Mongshung\\", the first video to promote the album. On December 7, he released the cover art for the album. Jovi released the second video \\"Ou M√™me\\", on February 17, one day after the album was released.  Critical reception  16 Wives was generally well received by music critics in Cameroon and internationally, particularly the production of the album. According to Koko Aldo Tsague of Le Bled Parle, Jovi's \\"epic production of the album perfectly combines African musical traditions with contemporary hip hop\\" (translated from French). In reviewing the album's single \\"Ou M√™me\\", Sebastian Bouknight of Afropop Worldwide states that Jovi \\"combines his witty social commentary with premium production skills to craft a unique sound that has roots in hip- hop, trap, R&B;, and local bikutsi rhythms.\\" In Jeune Afrique, Mathieu Olivier states that Jovi uses his engineering skills \\"acquired in India, to deliver a high-quality, technical album\\" (translated from French). Paris-based Oodar Africa reviewed 16 Wives and called Jovi \\"one of the best producers on the African continent\\" (translated from French). The tone and lyrical content of 16 Wives has been described as more sensitive than his previous two LPs. Jovi sings more on the album and addresses more personal subject matter in songs like \\"Free Music\\" which talks about love, and \\"Mad Love/Hospital Bills\\", which tells a story about the death of a girlfriend. This Is Africa contributor Nchanji M. Njamnsi agrees that in Jovi's previous albums looking for tenderness is like \\"looking for a needle in a haystack,\\" but he states that the experimental sound \\"poses the danger of narrowing his audience to only a small group of connoisseurs and people who have a rich musical culture like himself.\\"  Track listing   References  2017 albums Jovi (musician) albums ","title":"16 Wives"},{"id":"54279690","text":"Dario Ivanovski () (born May 1997) is a Macedonian long distance runner who runs for AK Rabotnicki Skopje and the Macedonia national team.

Established in 1970 as a unit of the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, the 9,621 acre Wilderness is administered by the U. S Fish and Wildlife Service. Combining the scrub lands of the Chihuahuan Desert with the riparian environment of the Pecos River and the Artesian basin of eastern New Mexico, Salt Creek represents a rare convergence of desert and wetlands. The Refuge Bitter Lake N.W.R. Visitor Center Established in 1937, the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge is an important waypoint for thousands of migratory waterfowl, as well as the year-round home of a number of native species. Between October and February, the seasonal wetlands of the 24,609-acre unit are a temporary home to tens of thousands of ducks, geese, and cranes, as well as large populations of white pelicans and snowy egrets. The Wilderness Unlike the riparian areas found in the other units of Bitter Lake NWR, which draw thousands of migratory waterfowl annually, the Salt Creek area sees few migratory birds, since the area has no wetlands. The Area was originally proposed as a Wilderness area to protect the red rock bluffs at the north end of the unit, home to populations of native species such as roadrunners, quail, and ring-necked pheasant, as well as cottontails, black-tailed jackrabbits, deer, coyotes, and bobcats. The unit includes a section of the Pecos River, as well as a number of sinkhole lakes, many of which are habitat for the Pecos pupfish. Location and Access A separate unit of the Bitter Lake NWR, the Salt Creek Wilderness is located along and north of U. S. Highway 70, locally known as the Clovis Highway. The main access point to the southern end of the Wilderness is located on U S. 70, approximately 10 miles from the intersection of U S. 70 with U. S. 285, 2 miles north of Roswell, N.M. The western end of the Wilderness can be accessed via Chaves County Road 15, also known as One Horse Road, from its intersection with U. S. 285, 7.5 miles north of the intersection of 285 and U. S. 70. This is a day-use only area, with no camping or campfires allowed.

Three-year-old season  In her three-year-old debut, Go Maggie Go's connections shipped her down to Florida for the winter. On March 13, 2016, at Gulfstream Park, that day she finished first in a $60,000 Maiden Special Weight six furlong race. Next up for Maggie was a big step up in class at Gulfstream Park in the $250,000 Grade II Gulfstream Park Oaks. In that race as the 4-1 third choice she won and beat the likes of Paola Queen who finished second and the 4-5 favorite Off the Tracks in the field of seven. That win earned her an automatic berth into both the Kentucky Oaks and the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. In only the third start of her career Go Maggie Go finished fourth in the Kentucky Oaks behind winner Cathryn Sophia earning a check for $100,000.00. Later that month in May 2016, trainer Dale Romans and owner Michael Tarp decided to ship the filly to Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, to run in the May 20 second jewel of the de facto Filly Triple Crown, the $300,000 Grade 2 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. A capacity of fourteen three year-old fillies were entered, and Go Maggie Go was listed as a 2-1 second favorite behind only Land of Sea at 3-2. In the 1 1/8 miles race on dirt, she broke sharply and assumed the lead early as the field passed the stands for the first time. Fractions were moderate times of :23.49 for the first quarter and :48.83 for the half mile. Go Maggie Go rounded Pimlico's famous clubhouse turn in second two lengths behind 51-1 longshot Ma Can Do It.

Life Walter was born in Jelgava, south of Riga, and had German citizenship through his Baltic German mother. He studied art at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg with Janis RozentƒÅls and Vilhelms Purvƒ´tis, and built up an oeuvre that ranged from the academic realism of the 1890s, through a style inspired by Impressionism and Expressionism, to the verge of abstraction with a peculiar non-objective vision of nature late in his career. At the turn of the 20th century Walter stood out as one of the most important emerging artists in Latvia, but left in 1906 to work in Dresden, where he changed his last name to Walter-Kurau. He lived in Dresden for 10 years before moving to Berlin in 1916 or 1917. More than 120 of his works are in the collection of Latvian National Museum of Art in Riga, including his most famous work from the pre-Germany era, Bathing Boys (1900).

He was the last Khan of Yarkent Khanate. He is known as one of the \\"later Chagatai princes\\"(ÂØüÂêàÂè∞ÂæåÁéã) in China.  Origin  Akbash Khan's name was Muhammad Mumin. He descended from the second son of Genghis Khan, Chagatai. He was a member of the Borjigin clan by blood. His father was Said Baba Khan of Eastern Khanate (Uyghurstan) and his grandfather was Ismail Khan. He had two brothers who were also at one point Khans of Yarkent Khanate (Abd ar-Rashid Khan II and Muhammad Imin Khan respectively).  Reign  In 1678, Galdan Boshugtu Khan of Dzungar invaded Yarkent Khanate on the invitation of Afak Khoja, who previously was exiled from the country by Ismail Khan, conquered eastern part of Yarkent Khanate, captured Ismail Khan in Yarkand and set up Abd ar-Rashid Khan II as a puppet. Instead of Afaq Khoja of the Naqshbandi order, Galdan appointed Rashid. This arrangement of power caused the later conflicts between the Moghuls and Khojas. Akbash was never supposed to inherit the title of Khan since his brothers were already ruling Yarkand Khanate. However, Abd ar-Rashid was captured by Oirats upon complaint of Afaq Khoja and Muhammad Imin died during the conflict with Afaq Khoja. Afaq then set his son Yahya Khoja as the Khan of Yarkent Khanate in 1692. In 1694, Afaq Khoja was poisoned and died. His son Yahya also died of Oirat riots. Muhammad Imin's sister Khanum Padshah took power in 1695 but was killed in the same year. After these incidents, Akbash was the only legitimate successor of the title of Khan. In 1695, he was installed as a Khan by Yarkent Begs. On the other hand, Begs in Kashgar had different ideas, they invited Kirghiz tribes and installed Akbash's son Mahmud as a Khan. Kashgar and Kirghiz joint forces attacked Yarkent and captured it, making Akbash a captive. The Yarkent Begs sought the help of Oirats. The Oirats successfully took back Yarkent city but Akbash lost his title permanently. During his reign, Akbash Khan was not able to effectively control the city of Kashgar since most of the followers of Afaq Khoja were centered in Kashgar. His influence was limited in Yarkent and the cities that lie eastward.

As such, Switzerland is often classified as the model liberal-market economy of continental Europe, and stands out amongst other continental European states due to its small, means- tested welfare program. The OECD cites Switzerland's social expenditure as 19.6% of their gross domestic product, a rate that parallels other liberal- market states' spending rates. History The welfare state arose in Switzerland in the late 19th century, and its existence and depth varied individually by canton. Some of the programs first adopted within Swiss cantons were emergency relief, elementary schools, and homes for the elderly and children. The Swiss Confederation's 1945 constitutional mandate introduced a maternity allowance for Swiss women, yet Parliament's inability to pass laws funding the programs resulted in stalled implementation until 2004. Overview Switzerland's public social security policies include pensions, income compensation and family allowances. These programs are funded via contributions from earned income by citizens, an economic policy comparative to conservative market economies in other Christian Democratic states throughout Europe. Switzerland's AHV program is an income-replacement system for elderly citizens unable to work or their survivors. This system is funded via income taxation and redistributed to recipients to ensure the individual's ability to afford subsistence. Disability insurance is similarly provided to those unable to work due to birth defect, disease or accident. Family allowances are distributed to Swiss families by the government to compensate for the costs of raising children. Each child rates an individual family allowance package.

Biography  Curran formed the psych-folk duo Arborea in 2005 with partner Shanti Deschaine, with whom he recorded five albums and toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe between 2006 and 2015. Curran's music is associated with the Psychedelic Folk and Indie Folk genres, though his musical origins stem from performing traditional and original Blues and Folk in the 1990s. In 2009 he produced the benefit compilation Leaves of Life (2009), which included notable artists Devendra Benhart, Marissa Nadler, Alela Diane, etc. Curran also contributed to the renewal of interest in Robbie Basho producing two tribute albums, We Are All One in the Sun (2010) and Basket Full of Dragons (2016). In the Winter of 2011/2012 The Fretboard Journal published a feature article on Robbie Basho (Voice of the Eagle) written by Curran for Issue 24. In July 2016 he released his first solo record, Immortal Light, a split release between ESP-Disk and Obsolete Recordings. Curran is also an artist and painted the cover for Basket Full of Dragons. In July 2014 his paintings were part of a special exhibition in Denmark at the Fano Free Folk Festival, during which he also presented a special discussion on his spontaneous brushstroke technique using watercolors and improvisation in art. In 2017 his paintings were exhibited in Bergamo, Italy in December 2017 at InArteWerkkunst Gallery during the NOWART Exhibition. As well, he is a notable guitar maker who worked from 2002 to 2009 for renowned Maine luthier Dana Bourgeois, where he developed his own guitar model called Butterfly. His prototype for the Butterfly was included (alongside other notable luthiers from Maine: Dana Bourgeois, John Slobod, etc.) in the 'Player's Art': Guitar Exhibition at the Colby College Museum of Art May 7 thru July 17, 2005. Acoustic Guitar Magazine featured one of Curran's Butterfly guitars (made in 2006) for their 'Great Acoustics' article in the March 2012 issue. His acoustic and electric guitar playing is characterized by the extensive use of low alternate tunings, slide, Ebow, reverb, manipulating string overtones and dynamics creating haunting voice- like timbres on the instrument.

Mondotrack is developed by Mondo, a world leader in Track and field surfacing. Research was done to achieve the best possible surface for track events that will enhance performance and decrease the chance of injury. All Mondotracks come with a woven top layer and a hexagonal base layer. Unlike other tracks, Mondotracks can be different colors. Mondotracks are very prominent around the world.https://globenewswire.com/news- release/2016/10/24/881960/0/en/University-of-South-Carolina-installs-Mondo- Super-X-720-track-fulfilling-coach-s-dream-of-having-Mondo.html  History  In 1980, Mondo, with the help of several biomechanical research laboratories from around the world, began researching new material for an athletic track surface. Mondo's goal was to improve \\"athletic performance, comfort and safety\\". The result of their research was the innovative Mondotrack. Since then, Mondotrack has become a staple synthetic track surface used all over the world.https://globenewswire.com/news- release/2016/10/24/881960/0/en/University-of-South-Carolina-installs-Mondo- Super-X-720-track-fulfilling-coach-s-dream-of-having-Mondo.html Many colleges in the United States and professional Track and field venues like the one used in the 2011 IAAF World Championships have had Mondotrack as their surface. Mondotrack's superior design has led to many world competitions to use the type of track. Recent uses have been the 2016 Olympic Games and the 2012 Olympic Games. Over 260 world records have been set on a Mondotrack.https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/08/15/864268/0/en/Two- world-records-set-on-Mondotrack-WS-at-Rio-Olympic-Games.html  Surface  Mondotrack comes in several variations: Mondotrack WS (Championship series), Super X Performance, and Super X 720. The surface is a seamless structure that is created through a vulcanized process. Two distinct layers make up the track: The top layer being a rubber-based soft surface and the bottom layer being a hard elongated hexagonal surface. The thickness is 13.5 mm and is available in eight different colors. Mondotrack comes in rolls no longer than 15 meters in length that are then assembled to make the complete track.  Spikes  Because of the design of the Mondotrack surface, certain spikes for running shoes are required. Compression (Christmas tree) spikes and 6mm (1/4in) pyramid spikes are promoted for use on Mondotracks. These spikes will not damage the track. Needle spikes however, will damage the track. The thin- sharp pointed needle spikes allow the spike to penetrate the surface which can rupture and degrade the track over time.

Keith wrote under the pen names of Erle Douglas and Di Vernon. She wrote for Demorest's Monthly Magazine, Kate Field's Washington, Good Housekeeping, The Daily Alta California, San Francisco Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner, The San Francisco Call, and the San Francisco News Letter. She was a special correspondent of the San Francisco Recorder-Union, the Journalist, and Kate Fields Washington. Keith was a member of Pacific Coast Women's Press Association, the Illinois Press League, the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Golden Gate Kindergarten Association. Keith, of New England and Knickerbocker ancestry, was a native of San Francisco and a graduate of its public schools. Under the pen name of \\"Di Vernon,\\" she began her career as staff writer for the San Francisco News Letter. Her articles were extensively copied throughout the United States, appearing in the leading papers of San Francisco, the Pacific Coast, and in many journals of the East Coast. On several occasions, Keith acted as special correspondent for the Sacramento Record-Union, representing that paper at the World's Columbian Exposition. The bronze medal of the San Francisco Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was awarded to her for the services she rendered to the literature of the prevention of cruelty. She believed in practical patriotism and an earnest effort to rescue the U.S. flag from desecration. Her first published article, at the age of 13, was titled \\"Our Flag\\". The importance of a Columbus Day celebration by school children was first urged by Keith upon the San Francisco public in her \\"Di Vernon\\" column of the San Francisco News Letter. She also originated the idea of patriotism among school children, to be known as \\"The Order of the American Flag.\\" Keith was the first teacher to introduce the salute to the American flag as a part of the regular opening exercises each day in the classroom. Eventually, the whole school joined in the exercise. This pioneer work stimulated many others to follow in the path initiated by Keith. In March, 1894, she had the satisfaction of witnessing the official adoption of her patriotic idea. The San Francisco Board of Education passed a resolution that the last hour of the last Friday of each month should be given to patriotic exercises, including the salute of the flag. She died in 1939. Early years and education Eliza Douglas Keith was born 1854 in San Francisco to William Henry Keith and Sarah Ann Atwill (maiden; 1836‚Äì1924). Her maternal grandfather, Joseph Fairfield Atwill (1811‚Äì1891), had been a music publisher in New York City, but went to California in 1849, where he was remembered as an \\"Argonaut of '49\\" and a prominent public officer. Two of his brothers were editors, Keith's father, William, was a well-known chemist of San Francisco, who had been tester of coinage in the California mint, and also deputy collector of the San Francisco port. She was of Knickerbocker descent. Her middle name, Douglas, is an Anglicized spelling of the surname of her maternal grandmother, Eliza A. Dugliss (1814‚Äì1903). Keith's parents early detected her literary talents and determined to give her as good an education as the Pacific coast could at that time afford. She was a very bright child, and at the age of six could read and write with ease. Before she was seven years old, she had made up her mind to make literature her profession. Keith published her first work at the age of 13. She was a graduate of the San Francisco Girls' High School. Career After graduating from high school, she became a principal of the Sherman School in San Francisco. She also became a contributor to the daily and weekly press, as well as the amateur press from 1879. These were principally poems, such as \\"A Fragment\\". But her best work in amateur journalism was in the form of extended sketches. Her first production of this kind, entitled \\"Through a Thermometer\\", was published in pamphlet form by Philip I. Figel in 1882. Her later sketch, written in 1886, entitled, \\"Did She Care For Him?\\" also published by Figel in pamphlet form, was considered an improvement. This was not a very original love story, but the method of telling was more than ordinary. The best work was, perhaps, in the descriptions, but the characters were well brought out, and the plot was skillfully unfolded. While in school she had already written some verses, and she continued to send occasional poems to the papers. One of these poems, entitled ‚ÄúOur Flag,‚Äù written during the Civil War, demonstrated her strong poetical talents. She became connected with the Alta Californian, the Chronicle, the Examiner, and the Call, of San Francisco, both as a space writer and a contributor of special articles, usually without signature. As this method of impersonal journalism made her but little known except in a limited circle, she adopted the nom de plume of ‚ÄúErie Douglas,‚Äù contributing poetical charades to the puzzle columns of the weekly papers and winning prizes in contests for the best essays. She wrote poems of humor for the Wasp, and edited the ‚ÄúSnap Shots‚Äù department for the San Francisco News Letter. Eliza D. Keith Most of her later work appeared over the signature of \\"Di Vernon\\", by which name she became known all over the Pacific coast. She also contributed to Eastern periodicals, as her notability extended, such as Demorest's Monthly Magazine, Kate Field's Washington, Good Housekeeping, and other publications devoted to the interests of women. She also wrote many short stories. Under \\"Di Vernon\\", she served as special writer for the Alta Californian, San Francisco Chronicle, Examiner, and Call, as well as the San Francisco News Letter; was a special correspondent of the San Francisco Recorder-Union, and wrote also for the Journalist, Kate Fields Washington, and many other periodicals. In 1892, as a member of the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association, Keith scored a \\"journalistic triumph\\" for her comments published by the Illustrated American. Beginning with a Fourth of July article, 1890, she published a glowing article in the News Letter, in which she stated: ‚ÄúIt is treason to haul down the flag from the masthead; it is treason to degrade it in the estimation of a child.\\" In February, 1891, she asked: \\"Shall the flag of our country be debased by bearing upon its fair surface an advertising device? If there be no law to prevent it, let us have one at once.\\" In September, 1891, she delivered an address before the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association at Union Square Hall. The peroration was a patriotic outburst, calling upon Congress to protect the flag from the advertising 'fiend'. This was published in the Daily Report, of San Francisco, and in the New York Journalist, giving it a widespread circulation. This address also contained an exposition of \\"Di Vernon's\\" pet project, the organization of the \\"Order of the American Flag,\\" a patriotic legion, among the children of America. At other times during the last few years which preceded this, Keith (as Di Vernon) made similar appeals to arouse the patriotic sentiment. So she was surprised, after picking up a copy of the Illustrated American in April 1892, to find a self-laudatory editorial, in which the paper congratulated itself that the crusade which it had inaugurated against the flag-advertising was about yield results. To claim the whole credit for that aroused Di Vernon's sense of justice. She wrote to the editor, asking the date of the ‚Äúinauguration.‚Äù Maurice Meyer Minton, Sr. replied in a courteous note, stating that the matter was brought up in editorials of vol. 9, page 530, dated Feb. 6, 1892. Keith (Di Vernon) found all the dates of her patriotic articles, and in the News Letter of May 14, 1892, published a history of the whole matter, under the caption: ‚ÄúHonor the Flag\\". With characteristic directness, Di Vernon asked: \\"Don't you think that instead of taking the lead, you were rather late in dropping into line?\\" Report of Historical Landmarks Committee of the Native Daughters Golden West Keith's works included, Report of Historical Landmarks Committee of the Native Daughters Golden West (W. N. Brunt, 1902); Outlines of California history (San Francisco, W. N. Brunt Press, 1916); and Keith's outlines in astronomy and geography (Donaldson publishing company, San Francisco, 1917); During the period of 1913‚Äì14, Keith wrote a column, \\"The School Teachers' Page\\" for the Western Journal of Education. She served as associate editor of the Household Realm of Cleveland, Ohio. She was a member of and speaker at the gatherings of Pacific Coast Women's Press Association, She was also a member of the Illinois Press League. Keith's style was characterized as \\"bright and sparkling, full of satire without bitterness\\". Personal life Keith was especially interested in subjects pertaining to women. She was deeply religious, and served as a teacher in a mission Sunday-school, besides being a supporter of the cause of temperance. She was a member of the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; wrote \\"Di Vernon's Corner,\\" besides editing a children's column, in the \\"Humane World\\" of St. Paul, Minnesota. In October 1891, she received the bronze medal of the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, in recognition of service rendered to the cause of humane education through her lectures and writing. In 1890, she was elected life member of the Golden Gate Kindergarten Association for similar reasons.

Compiled and edited by Kevin Jackson, who also provided a short introduction to the text, the book purports to collect most if not all of the poems published under the names F. X. Enderby, John Burgess Wilson, or Anthony Burgess, as well as selections from longer verse works by Burgess. Occasional annotations by Jackson accompany the text; additionally, those poems in Revolutionary Sonnets and Other Poems which were first published elsewhere are appropriately labelled with this information. Contents The main body of the book is divided into four sections. The first section reproduces the full text of Burgess's shorter poetry, including the title \\"Five Revolutionary Sonnets\\" which were first published in The Transatlantic Review. Many of these poems, including the sonnets, were later attributed to the fictional F. X. Enderby, the protagonist of several novels by Burgess including Inside Mr. Enderby and its sequels. Additionally, some of the poems were previously printed in Little Wilson and Big God, a mostly autobiographical work, or in other literary journals. The second section, labelled for longer poems, contains three relatively lengthy poems by Burgess: O Lord, O Ford, God Help Us, Also You; Verses for the Seventieth Birthday of Vladimir Nabokov; and Homage to Ogden Nash. Also included are \\"Five Excerpts from Moses.\\" In the third section, editor Kevin Jackson excerpts the notable verse translations of Burgess. Reproduced are a large fragment of Burgess's translation of Pervigilium Veneris, which was incorporated into the novella The Eve of Saint Venus. A selection of translated sonnets by Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, originally appearing in the novel Abba Abba, also appears, although many of the sonnets are omitted. The reason given for this in the book's introduction is that Abba Abba remained in print at time of publication. For this reason, excerpts from Byrne: A Novel are missing from Revolutionary Sonnets and Other Poems as well. The final section samples Burgess's work in dramatic verse, opera libretti, and musical lyrics. Included are extracts from adaptations of Carmen by Georges Bizet, Oberon by Carl Maria von Weber, Oedipus the King by Sophocles, Chatsky by Alexander Griboyedov, and Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmond Rostand, as well as original works Blooms of Dublin, the unfinished Shakespearean musical Will!, Trotsky's in New York!, A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music, and Mozart and the Wolf Gang. Reception Literary critics released generally positive reviews for Revolutionary Sonnets and Other Poems. Andrew Biswell, writing for The Guardian, heaped high praise on both the editor's handling of footnotes and the author's choice subject matter, positively comparing the historical treatment of the Protestant Reformation in the \\"Five Revolutionary Sonnets\\" to the verses written by W. H. Auden on the Second Sino-Japanese War. However, Biswell noted with disappointment the absence of several verses from longer Burgess works, as well as the wholesale omission of \\"An Essay on Censorship.\\" In Quadrant magazine, Olivier Burckhardt largely echoed these sentiments, particularly the disappointment that Byrne: A Novel was not included. He identified the Belli translations as \\"Burgess at his best\\" and labeled the character of Enderby as an \\"archtype\\" of poetry. Dan Chiasson's review in Poetry was considerably more mixed, characterizing the collection as \\"bizarre.\\" In particular, he asserted that Burgess's poetry was only a minor part of his contribution to literature, and frankly stated that \\"the badness of this is simply incomprehensible.\\" However, he did approve of Burgess's incorporation of his original poetry in the comic novels of the Enderby series, and acknowledged that the poems themselves had an audience. \\"If you and your friends sit around coming up with silly ideas for opera titles ('Mozart and the Whole Wolf Gang' [sic]),\\" Chiasson opined, \\"this book is for you.\\" References Further reading 2002 poetry books Poetry by Anthony Burgess Books published posthumously English poetry collections ","title":"Revolutionary Sonnets and Other Poems"},{"id":"54280194","text":"George Carver Clerk, (29 July 1931 ‚Äì 2 May 2019) was a Ghanaian botanist and plant pathologist. A professor and later, an emeritus professor at the University of Ghana, Legon, he also focused his research on West African mycology and ecology. Clerk, along with his academic contemporary Ebenezer Laing (1931‚Äì2015), was one of Ghana's earliest practitioners of botany as a scientific discipline, in addition to his pioneering role as a plant pathologist in West Africa. In 1973, G. C. Clerk became a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Early life and family  George Clerk was born on 29 July 1931 in Accra, Gold Coast. His father, Carl Henry Clerk (1895‚Äì1982), an agricultural educator, journalist and Presbyterian minister was elected the fourth Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1950 to 1954 and the Editor of the Christian Messenger, the newspaper of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana from 1960 to 1963. His mother, Martha Ayorkor Quao (1911‚Äì1989) was from La and Ga-Mashie. Quao's maternal grandfather was Nii Ngleshie Addy I, the first son of Nii Tetteh Tsuru I, the founder and ruler of the Otuopai Clan, a royal house in Ga Mashie. G. C. Clerk's father who had earlier studied agricultural science at Tuskegee University, incidentally named him after the American botanist, George Washington Carver, whose works the older Clerk had studied at the Institute, perhaps a foreshadowing of the infant George's future career path. George C. Clerk belonged to the historically notable Clerk family. His paternal great- grandfather, Alexander Worthy Clerk (1820‚Äì1906), a Jamaican Moravian educator arrived in the Danish Protectorate of Christiansborg, now Osu, in Accra in 1843, as part of the original group of 24 West Indians employed by the Swiss- based Basel Evangelical Missionary Society. A. W. Clerk co-established a boys' middle boarding school, the Salem School in 1843. His paternal great- grandmother, Pauline Hesse (1831‚Äì1909) was from the Gold Coast, and was of Euro-Ga heritage. His great-grandaunt was Regina Hesse (1832‚Äì1898), a pioneer educator. His grandfather, Nicholas Timothy Clerk (1862‚Äì1961), a theologian, was the first Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1918 to 1932, and a co-founder of the Presbyterian Boys‚Äô Secondary School, established in 1938. His grandmother, Anna Alice Meyer (1873‚Äì 934) was also a Euro-African. His uncle, Theodore S. Clerk (1909‚Äì1965) was the first Ghanaian architect and planned the port city, Tema. G. C. Clerk's aunts were Jane E. Clerk (1904‚Äì1999), a pioneer education administratior and Matilda J. Clerk (1916‚Äì1984), the second Ghanaian woman in orthodox-medicine. Pauline M. Clerk (1935 - 2013), a diplomat and presidential advisor, was his cousin, as was Alexander Adu Clerk (born 1947), a sleep medicine specialist and psychiatrist. George Clerk's granduncle was Emmanuel Charles Quist (1880‚Äì1959), a barrister and judge who became the first African President of the Legislative Council from 1949 to 1951, Speaker of the National Assembly of the Gold Coast from 1951 to 1957, and Speaker of the National Assembly of Ghana from March 1957 to November 1957. Clerk's maternal uncle was the jurist and judge, Nii Amaa Ollennu (1906‚Äì1986), elected the Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana during the Second Republic as well as serving as the Chairman of the Presidential Commission and acting President of Ghana from 7 August 1970 to 31 August 1970. His uncle was Nathan Quao (1915‚Äì2005), a diplomat, educationist and public servant who doubled as a presidential advisor to several Heads of State of Ghana. Moreover, his first cousin was the economist and diplomat, Amon Nikoi (1930‚Äì2002), appointed the Governor of the Bank of Ghana from 1973 to 1977 and Finance minister from 1979 to 1981.  Education and training  George Clerk was a pupil at Presbyterian primary schools at Somanya and Osu. He attended the boys' middle boarding school, the Salem School. Clerk had his secondary education at the Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School, then located in Odumase- Krobo. He enrolled at the University College of the Gold Coast and received his bachelor's degree in botany with first-class honours and winning the first prize as the best graduating student in botany from the University of London, then the parent institution of the university college. G. C. Clerk was then awarded a postgraduate research fellowship at the University of London and the University of Bristol, and in 1963, earned a joint PhD-DIC in botany, with a sub-concentration in physiological mycology, from Imperial College London where he wrote his dissertation on asexual spores of parasitic fungi growing on the bodies of insects. His doctoral advisor was the British mycologist, Michael Francis Madelin (1931-2007), one of the world's earliest investigators of conidial fungi and slime moulds. The pioneer British plant pathologist, Ronald Karslake Starr Wood (1919 ‚Äì 2017) also supervised his research in London.  Career  Prior to his postgraduate studies, Clerk taught biology at Prempeh College for about three years in the late 1950s and also served as an assistant housemaster there. During this period, he was also an instructor in mathematical sciences to adult education students. He then became a researcher at the Plant Services Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Clerk later became a professor of botany at the University of Ghana, Legon when he joined the institution in 1964. While at the University of Ghana, he served as the Senior Tutor of the Senior Common Room and the Hall Master for Akuafo Hall from 1979 to 1980, a hall he had lived in as a student. He served as the departmental head and was appointed the Dean of Graduate Studies at the university. He authored more than 250 peer-reviewed scientific publications including journal articles, abstracts, book chapters, textbooks as well as blueprints for international examination standards. Clerk's advanced treatise on plant diseases in Ghana and West Africa influenced public policies pertaining to plant development, as illustrated by his experimental investigation of the fungal pathogenesis of the black pod disease in the cocoa bean. In 1973, he became a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, the only scholar to be elected that year. George Clerk's seminal book, Crops and their diseases in Ghana, was published in 1974, and secured the Ghana Book Award in 1982. G. C. Clerk was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of California, Riverside between 1972 and 1973. He was a visiting professor at the Ahmadu Bello and Lagos universities in Nigeria. He assumed the Dean of Science position at the University of Port Harcourt in the mid-eighties. He was a board director at the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission from 1996 to 1998 along with his academic colleague, Marian Ewurama Addy, the first Ghanaian woman professor of natural science. He was a resource person, chief examiner for biology and a consultant to the West African Examinations Council. He was an external examiner and an assessor for faculty promotions at other institutions of higher education. Clerk was a regional representative of the Association of African Universities. Furthermore, he was a trustee at major organisations such as the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Ghana National Commission for UNESCO, the Volta Basin Research Project and the Water Research Institute, formerly the Institute for Aquatic Biology.  Personal life  G. C. Clerk was married; his children were Judith, George, Jnr., Nicholas, Theodore, Daniel and Dinah. Clerk was a trained pianist. His older brother was Nicholas T. Clerk (1930‚Äì2012), a former GIMPA Rector.  Death and funeral  George Clerk died in Accra on 2 May 2019 after a short illness. Clerk's funeral service was held at the Akuafo Hall Chapel on the campus of the University of Ghana, Legon, before his burial at the Osu Cemetery in Accra.

Her research interests includes female patronage, icons and the cult of the Virgin Mary. She was formerly the head of Postgraduate Studies in the College of Arts and Law, University of Birmingham. Professor Brubaker is also on the Executive Committee of the Society for the Promotion of Byzantine Studies. Her work is widely stocked in libraries around the world.  Biography  Brubaker was educated at Pennsylvania State University, USA, where she obtained her BA in 1972 and then an MA in 1976. Brubaker continued on to complete her PhD at Johns Hopkins University. Her PhD thesis was entitled 'The Illustrated Copy of the Homilies of Gregory of Nazianzus in Paris (Biblioth√®que Nationale, cod. gr. 510)' (in two volumes). Brubaker was simultaneously employed as an instructor in the Department of Art, Wheaton College, Massachusetts between 1981 and 1983. She became an Assistant (1983-1990) and then Associate Professor (1990‚Äì93) in the Department of Art, Wheaton College, while also serving as Chair at the college in 1993-94. In 1994, Brubaker moved to the University of Birmingham in England, where she has continued her research and teaching career up until the present day; in 2005, she was appointed as Professor of Byzantine Art History. She arranged to share the position with Dr Ruth Macrides, so enabling both women to do research and \\"have a life\\". From 2003, she has served as the Director of the Centre Byzantine, Ottoman and Modern Greek Studies (founded by Anthony Bryer) at the University of Birmingham, and from 2005 to 2009 as the Assistant Director (Research) of the Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity. A festschrift in her honour was published in 2011. Her husband is the Oxford medievalist, Professor Christopher Wickham.  Research  Brubaker began as an expert in Byzantine illuminated manuscripts, writing a pathbreaking book on one manuscript, Paris Grec. 510, in her Vision and Meaning. Her interests have extended since to the cultural history of Iconoclasm and the development of the cult of icons, on which she wrote two now-basic books on the subject with John Haldon. She has written substantially on the relationship between material culture and its visual expressions, and other aspects of cultural history, including visual and textual representations of gender, and female patronage. She has been fellowships at Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, first in 1980-81 as a Junior Fellow, a Summer Fellow in 1984 and a Spring Fellow in 2001 and 2016. Her research into icons, relics and the proliferation of the cult of the Virgin Mary (known as the Theotokos) in Byzantium developed into a major research project subsidized by an Arts and Humanities Research Council grant and the International Iconoclasms network, led by Brubaker with Dr Richard Clay (University of Birmingham), in collaboration with the Tate Britain.

He was named as the third coach for Niagara in the spring of 2017. Career The Pittsburgh native played for the ice hockey team for four seasons while attending SUNY-Geneseo. After graduating with a BA in history he played two seasons as a professional in the now-defunct WCHL(West Coast Hockey League). Lammers started his coaching career in 2000 as a volunteer assistant with Clarkson before taking a full-time assistant position with Hobart the following year. The Golden Knights lured him back a year later as an assistant but after head coach Mark Morris was fired mid-season Lammers was on the move once again. He spent one season at both Alaska and Princeton before receiving his first head coaching job with his alma mater. Lammers led Geneseo to a 19‚Äì9‚Äì2 record, winning the SUNYAC tournament for the second year in a row. He didn't stick around to build on the success, however, leaving to join the staff at Ohio State in 2006. With the Buckeyes Lammers finally found a home for longer than a year, remaining with the program for three seasons before accepting a similar post with Colorado College for two seasons. He had a four year stint with Massachusetts‚ÄìLowell under Norm Bazin, helping the team reach the 2013 Frozen Four, before he got his second head coaching gig, this time with the Dubuque Fighting Saints. In his first season with the team Lammers got the junior squad to post a 39‚Äì19‚Äì1 record and make it all the way to the Clark Cup Final.

After about two years in early access, it was released in May 2020 for Microsoft Windows. Gameplay Deep Rock Galactic is a 1-4 player cooperative first-person shooter video game where players work together while exploring procedurally generated cave systems. Players take on the role of four space dwarves assigned to various missions, which include many objectives such as mining specific minerals, stealing alien eggs, eliminating targets, or retrieving lost equipment. These are usually the main objective, required to complete the mission. It is possible to complete a secondary objective (usually collecting other materials or items) to receive extra credits, which are used to improve the player's weapons and abilities of the classes, and experience points, which increase a players level. The game takes place in dark caves on Hoxxes IV, a dangerous planet full of minerals, biomes, and bugs. Biomes are where the missions take place, and range from galactic salt mines to radioactive tunnels. The main antagonists are various swarms of alien arachnids called Glyphids.  Classes  = Overview = There are four playable classes to choose from: The Engineer, The Gunner, The Driller, and The Scout. Each class has their own experience level, with the player's progress shown as their player rank. Once a player has reached level 25 on a class they are offered a promotion, resetting their class levels and unlocking end-game content. Players can choose their class while in the lobby by using the character selection terminal inside of any of the players' bays. Each of the four playable classes has two primary and two secondary weapons options. Initially only one primary and secondary weapon is offered to the player with the other weapon option unlocked as the player progresses through the game. Weapons can be upgraded by choosing a weapon upgrade at specific levels. Weapons can also be overclocked, some overclocks add a small benefit with no downside, others offer a huge upside with a significant penalty. = Class Summaries = The Engineer uses a shotgun as his primary weapon and a grenade launcher as his secondary weapon by default. These can be replaced with an electrical submachine gun and a plasma gun which fires horizontal plasma beams. To support his team the Engineer has a platform gun that fires circular platforms, and a deployable sentry gun that automatically locks onto enemies. The Engineer acts as a primarily defensive class, utilizing his sentry gun as area denial to prevent the Glyphid swarms from approaching too closely. His grenade launcher can be used to clear large groups of enemies and his plasma gun effectively deals damage and strips armor from the larger Glyphids. He works well in conjunction with the Scout, who can grapple onto the Engineer's platforms and mine isolated minerals. The Gunner uses a minigun as his primary weapon and high-caliber revolver as his secondary weapon. These can later be replaced with a high-caliber autocannon and a rapid fire pistol. To support his team the Gunner uses a zipline gun that fires anchored ziplines, and a deployable shield generator that generates a protective shield bubble. The Gunner acts as the team's source of heavy firepower and is able to kill a large amount of bugs quickly. His zipline gun makes up for his lack of mobility and allows the team to traverse difficult terrains such as chasms and cliffs. His shield generator provides protection for his team during Glyphid swarms, preventing most bugs from entering the shields radius while it is deployed. The Driller uses a flamethrower as his primary weapon and semi- automatic pistol as his secondary weapon. These can later be replaced with freeze cannon and plasma pistol respectively. The Driller uses handheld power drills to dig through terrain much faster than the regular pickaxe does as his utility tool, and a satchel charge that carves out a large portion of terrain, or kills enemies in its blast as his deployable. In most use cases, the Driller allows the team to navigate through blocked paths with ease, or forms shortcuts with the help of his power drills, which is especially useful when returning to the Droppod after the missions objectives are completed. The Scout uses an assault rifle as his primary weapon and double-barreled sawed- off shotgun as his secondary weapon. These can later be replaced with a semi- automatic rifle based on the M1 Garand and dual-wield machine pistols respectively. The Scout uses a grappling gun to quickly navigate around caves as his utility tool, and flare gun to fire bright, long-lasting flares anchored to the terrain as his deployable. In most use cases, the Scout moves ahead of the team with ease with his grappling gun for reconnaissance and aids his team by illuminating dark caves with his flare gun, uncovering hidden ore veins and dangers. The Scout is also able to mine difficult-to-reach ores or items with ease and safety, especially with Engineer's platform. However, the Scout needs to be careful to not overextend due to his limited self-defense capabilities. His weapons heavily favors a hit-and-run tactic by kiting around and hitting enemies without them being able to retaliate.  Reception  The Early Access version of Deep Rock Galactic was well received by critics, who praised the game's atmosphere and challenging levels. Multiple reviewers compared parts of the experience of Deep Rock Galactic to Minecraft and Left 4 Dead. The full version of the game was released on May 13, 2020.

The electorate, consisting of the residents of the two counties at the time of independence, voted overwhelmingly to be returned to Bunyoro.  Background  In 1893‚Äì4, British colonel Henry Colvile invaded the Kingdom of Bunyoro in an effort to secure and expand the nascent Uganda Protectorate, which initially included solely the Kingdom of Buganda. Colvile promised all lands south of the River Kafu to Buganda in return for their support, and following the conflict the relevant counties were duly transferred as promised, with the transfer recognised in the Buganda Agreement (1900). Despite deliberate attempts by the Bugandan government to integrate the resident Banyoro, the return of the 'lost counties' was the subject of repeated appeals from the Bunyoro government to the British government. The potential for conflict between the two Kingdoms was therefore still a considerable cause for concern in the run up to independence amid considerable violence. In 1961 the Uganda Relationships Commission, under the leadership of the Earl of Munster, was tasked with looking into the issue. It proposed that a referendum should be held in three of the disputed counties: Buyaga and Bugangaizi (the two counties which retained the strongest cultural and ethnic ties to Bunyoro) and a third county of Bunyoro's choice. This would \\"put [Bunyoro's] claims to the test in a county where the figures appear to be against her so that Bunyoro would have no grievance in future based upon unqualified success in a strictly limited referendum\\". In the talks leading up to Ugandan Constitutional Conference of September and October 1961, neither Bunyoro nor Buganda looked favourably on such a proposition: Bunyoro favoured a referendum in all the lost counties and Buganda a referendum in none. Bunyoro only agreed to participate in the Conference if the 'lost counties' issue was on the agenda; and when the British Colonial Secretary Ian Macleod suggested that the proposed referendum could not proceed given the lack of Bugandan support, and instead proposed the establishment of a further Commission of Privy Councillors, Bunyoro's delegates walked out. The Bunyoro government was deeply unhappy with the perceived lack of progress. On 15 October the Rukurato (Parliament of Bunyoro) passed a resolution to the effect that from midnight on 18 October they would simply treat the lost counties as though they had reverted to Bunyoro, though this had little practical effect. The Commission, under the leadership of Lord Molson, arrived in Uganda on 8 January 1962 and reported to the British government in March 1962. Publication of its findings was however delayed until after the Ugandan general election and it was finally published in May. The final report favoured the transfer of two of the lost counties to Bunyoro, in exchange for Bunyoro dropping their claim on the remaining counties; it did not favour holding a referendum for fear of further violence. The report was met with outcry in the Bugandan parliament.  Referendum  Without any sign of agreement between the Kingdoms of Bunyoro and Buganda, the terms of the final settlement were dictated by the new British Colonial Secretary Reginald Maudling and set out in the conclusions of the Uganda Independence Conference held at Marlborough House in June 1962. As finalised in the resultant Uganda (Independence) Order, a referendum would be held in Buyaga and Bugangaizi counties only. Voters would be asked whether the two counties should continue to be part of Buganda, be transferred back to Bunyoro, or be established as a separate district. The referendum could not take place before 9 October 1964 (i.e. for two years after independence). For those two years, the counties were to administered directly by the central government. At Second Reading of the Uganda Independence Bill, Hugh Fraser set out the British Government's rationale: The holding of a referendum was confirmed through the introduction of a Bill by the ruling Uganda People's Congress party (UPC) in August 1964. The Referendum (Buyaga and Bugangaizi) Bill set a date of 4 November 1964. It also restricted the franchise to only those citizens living in the counties at the point of independence. This angered the Bugandan government, which had spent 1963 and early 1964 embarking on an expensive resettlement scheme (the Ndaiga Scheme) to bolster the number of Baganda living in Buyaga. The introduction of the Bill coincided with the formal dissolution of the UPC's alliance with the Kabaka Yekka (KY) party of Bugandan monarchists, and several KY members walked out in protest. The Kabaka himself, Edward Mutesa II, had recently been elected by the Parliament of Uganda as President, and refused to sign the Bill. Alternative arrangements were therefore made for the Prime Minister, Milton Obote, to sign the Bill into law. The arrangements for the referendum were subject to unsuccessful litigation led by the Bugandan government; a final appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London was still outstanding at the point of the referendum. For the purposes of the referendum, the two counties were divided into 72 polling stations.  Result  The referendum went ahead on 4 November 1964 as planned. The result went overwhelmingly in favour of returning the two counties to the Kingdom of Bunyoro. In Buyaga, 86% of voters favoured reunion with Bunyoro, as did 60% or 70% of voters in Bugangaizi. The Constitution of Uganda (Third Amendment) Bill was introduced to the Parliament of Uganda to give effect to the result, with the Kabaka again refusing to sign it in January 1965. Again, it had to be signed into law by Obote. The result was subject to further (unsuccessful) litigation. The loss of the two counties reduced the number of saza (county) chiefs by two, and hence restricted the availability of patronage opportunities in Buganda. It also reduced the tax base by 3‚Äì4%. The referendum result was met with considerable violence in Buganda. The administration in Buganda, led by Katikkiro Michael Kintu, lost a vote of no confidence and resigned on 9 November.

It has a surface area of 445 acres and an average depth of 24 feet. The lake is long but not wide, extending approximately three miles from north to south but only half a mile at its widest. It narrows at two points and therefore divides into three distinct sections, known (from north to south) as First Bay, Second Bay, and Third Bay. Highland Lake achieves its maximum depth of 63 feet toward the center of Second Bay. The lake is popular for recreational purposes, including boating and fishing. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection stocks the lake annually with fish, and considers it a Trophy Trout and Bass Management Lake. Highland Lake is encircled by Wakefield Boulevard, which is a little over seven miles long, and its shores are heavily built up with residences (both seasonal and year-round) and dotted with many docks.

Early life Middleton was born on December 11, 1810 in Charleston, S.C. He was the son of Mary Helen Hering (1772‚Äì1850) and Henry Middleton (1770‚Äì1846). His family played important roles in the history of the United States during the colonial revolution and civil war periods. His great grandfather, Henry Middleton, was President of the Continental Congress. His grandfather, Arthur Middleton, was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. His father, Henry Middleton, was governor of South Carolina and ambassador to Russia from 1820 to 1830. The remains of the family home and gardens still exist on the banks of the Ashley river in South Carolina at Middleton Place. He was descended from an English family, the first of whom also named Edward Middleton came to America in 1678. Edward Middleton's (1810‚Äì1883) mother was Mary Helen Hering. Career After being educated in England and France, Edward joined his father and mother in Russia in 1827.. He then served six months with the Admiral of the Russian Fleet, Pyotr Ivanovich Ricord, on board his ship.

All those in attendance signed the document and Kieft agreed. The Pavonia Massacre took place, February 25‚Äì26. Eighty Native Americans were brutally massacred. Kieft ordered Adriaensen and a band of volunteers to go to Corlaers Hook to attack the refugees assembled there. Forty of the tribe, men, women and children, were killed.

These materials would create a thin veneer over the outer surface of the tooth. Although veneers looked better, these materials did not match the structure or characteristics of the tooth enamel and replacement was frequently needed. As far back as 1916, some researchers were advocating instead removing a thin layer of the outermost enamel to expose the (presumably) undamaged layer underneath. The first practical application of enamel microabrasion was developed by Theodore Croll and Richard Cavanaugh in 1986, who used a combination of weak hydrochloric acid and pumice to remove a few tenths of millimeters of the enamel.  Description  Contemporary enamel microabrasion uses a combination of mechanical and chemical means to remove of a small amount of tooth enamel (not more than a few tenths of a millimeter) to eliminate superficial discoloration. These discolorations can result from either from extrinsic factors (such as tobacco, dental plaque, certain foods, etc.) or intrinsic ones (most commonly dental fluorosis).  Indications  * Dental fluorosis is the most common indication where it ranges in severity from mild to severe, microabrasion should be considered the first option in treating mild and moderate cases of fluorosis. * Removal of intrinsic enamel stains, correction of surface irregularities and defects in enamel caused either after removal of orthodontic appliances or during tooth formation.  Contraindications  * The patients' age is not a limiting factor for the enamel microabrasion technique but in cases of not fully erupted teeth, it may be difficult to place rubber dam for the microabrasion process * Microabrasion is not indicated when discoloration is located in dentin such as in dentigenous imperfecta or tetracycline discoloration. * Should be delayed or not used in patients with deficient labial seal because enamel surfaces are extremely dry which makes stains more obvious.so, Sundfeld, et al in 2007, found that orthodontic lip repositioning should be done first to make removal of these stains more effective.  Consequences  Patients can benefit from combined microabrasion/ bleaching techniques as microabrasion causes reduction in the enamel surface and sometimes the tooth surface appear yellowish or darker due to exposure of dentin surface and thinning of enamel layer over it. In this condition, correction of this yellow color can be achieved by using tooth whitening technique to mask the color. Fragoso, et al. (2011) found that applying fluoride paste on enamel surface after microabrasion process provides higher hardness & more enamel smoothness. in addition, Segura et al found that the treated enamel surface become more resistant to demineralisation than untreated enamel and less colonisation of bacteria occur.

Announced during E3 2017, the title is a direct sequel to 2015's Ori and the Blind Forest, and was released on March 11, 2020 for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. A Nintendo Switch version was released on September 17, 2020. Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S versions (the former getting an optimised version) are planned for release later in 2020. The game is a 4K UHD, Xbox One X Enhanced, and Xbox Play Anywhere title. The game was developed by Moon Studios, a collective organization without a set location. The game's visuals were given an overhaul from the two-dimensional artwork in Blind Forest, to the three- dimensional models played in multilayered backgrounds in Will of the Wisps. The game maintains narrative continuity with Blind Forest and introduces new melee combat. Upon release, the game received universal acclaim for the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch versions and favourable reviews for the Microsoft Windows version, with players and critics praising the game's visuals, improved combat, elements of exploration, environments, chase sequences, and soundtrack. However, criticism was aimed at technical issues such as frame rate issues and visual bugs, which were largely resolved with a day-one patch.  Gameplay  Players assume control of Ori, a white guardian spirit. As Ori, players must jump, climb, glide, and swim between various platforms to solve intricate puzzles. Gameplay unfolds in the form of a Metroidvania, with new abilities and upgrades allowing players to unlock previously inaccessible areas of the map. Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the Rayman and Metroid franchises. Unlike its predecessor Blind Forest, Will of the Wisps relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \\"soul links.\\" The sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a system of ‚Äúshards,‚Äù which can be purchased or found throughout the game to upgrade or modify Ori‚Äôs stats and attacks. Ori‚Äôs attacks can be managed via a convenient radial menu, and orbs to increase Ori‚Äôs health and energy can be found throughout the map. A new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at Gamescom 2018. The mode challenges players to race to a goal in the fastest time possible. To enhance competition and strategy, players can see the best times and the routes taken by other players. Will of the Wisps also introduces side quests from NPCs to earn collectible items such as Gorlek Ores, which are used to expand the game's hub area.  Plot  The story takes place immediately after the events of Blind Forest and is narrated by the Spirit Tree in the forest of Niwen. Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and raise as part of their family. Being born with a damaged wing, Ku is unable to fly until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to it. Ku and Ori go on a flight that ends up taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm separates them. Ori's search for Ku eventually leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of the inhabitants of Niwen, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter them. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. Meanwhile, Naru and Gumo head off to Niwen via a raft to find Ori and Ku. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods. There they reunite with Ku, but the pair encounters Shriek, a deformed, vicious owl ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen, who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind. Shriek attacks Ori and kills Ku. After Ori mourns Ku's death, Kwolok explains that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and is unable to bring Ku back in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's prior passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori find one of the wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the cause of its non-functionality. Ori breaks the spirit's control over Kwolok, allowing him to kill it, but the fight leaves him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place. Ori eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though they would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek appears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods to nestle under the wings of her parents' corpses. Ori merges with Seir, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and discover a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life as a family together, with the Spirit Tree revealing it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.  Development and release  Moon Studios' first game Ori and the Blind Forest was both a critical and commercial success, but Daniel Smith observed that players asked for more Ori, as they were able to complete the game in about eight hours. Smith said their team looked at how they could expand the game both in scale and in scope, while maintaining narrative continuity. Lead developer Thomas Mahler said of this change of scope and scale: \\"The idea is that Will of the Wisps should be to Blind Forest what Super Mario Bros. 3 was to the original Super Mario Bros.\\" As Blind Forest ended with Ori returning Sein, an entity from the Spirit Tree that granted Ori several of their combat abilities, back to Nibel's Spirit Tree, the team was tasked with discovering a new type of melee- focused combat for Ori with projectile-aiming aspects, which informed the story‚Äôs development. The original Ori was a game based only on two-dimensional artwork. Jeremy Gritton, an artist for Blizzard Entertainment at the time of Blind Forest release, was impressed with the game and left Blizzard to join Moon Studios to help lead the art development in Will of the Wisps, with a major shift of making all of the major character art into three-dimensional models played in multilayered backgrounds to make them look seamlessly integrated. This also was used to help with the programs used develop the more flexible and streamlined processes for the cinematics of the game. AM2R developer Milton Guasti joined the team for supporting level design, and part of the level design included recreating the original Blind Forest map within the Will of the Wisps world and wrapping more levels around it. Gareth Coker, who composed the first game's soundtrack, continued to do the music for the sequel, incorporating unique themes for each of the characters that Ori meets throughout the game. Because of the various expansion of scope and scale, Mahler and fellow lead developer Gennadiy Korol said the team was \\"crazy iterative\\" throughout the course of development. For example, the E3 2017 trailer went through 2,000 iterations during polishing. The Moon Studios team, originally about 20 at the time of Blind Forest release, expanded to 80 by the time Will of the Wisps was completed, but as with the first game, the team remained highly decentralized across the globe with few members working in the same common location and most working from home offices. Due to the increased scope, which Smith estimated was three times larger than Blind Forest, the game's development took longer than planned, resulting in a few delays. Smith said part of this is functionally tied to the nature of Metroidvanias: \\"Everything is so interconnected that if you change one aspect of the game, it's just inevitable that it's going to influence the rest. It just takes time to make an experience where we feel it's reached that polish that people want to enjoy.\\" The sequel was first announced at E3 2017 with no set release date. A second trailer was revealed a year later at E3 2018 with a planned 2019 release date. By E3 2019, a new trailer affirmed that the game had been delayed but with a planned February 11, 2020 release date. A final delay of one month was announced with the game's final release trailer at The Game Awards 2019, setting the release date of March 11, 2020. Xbox Game Studios announced a Collector's Edition on the same day which includes a piano collections music CD, a steelbook, premium packaging, an art book and an original soundtrack music MP3 download alongside the game disc. Ori and the Will of the Wisps was confirmed to be released on the same day on Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass program for both Xbox One and Windows. Smith said that being included on Game Pass was a net benefit for them: \\"I think Game Pass is a great vehicle to get what we've created into more gamers' hands and, ultimately, I think it's really healthy for the Ori IP, it's really healthy for Moon, it's really healthy for Xbox, for more people to play Ori.\\" Ori and the Will of the Wisps was released for Xbox One and Windows 10 on March 11, 2020. During Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase in July 2020, it was announced that the game would get an optimised version, running in 4k resolution at 120 fps, for the Xbox Series X, set for release sometime later in 2020. A version for the Nintendo Switch was announced during a Nintendo Direct Mini and was released on September 17, 2020.  Reception  Ori and the Will of the Wisps received \\"universal acclaim\\" for the Xbox One version based on 71 reviews, ‚Äúuniversal acclaim‚Äù for the Nintendo Switch version based on 19 reviews, and \\"generally favorable reviews\\" for the PC version of the game based on 43 reviews, according to review website Metacritic. By June 2020, the game was played by more than 2 million people. As of October 16, 2020, the Nintendo Switch version is tied with The Last of Us Part II, Half Life: Alyx, and the Nintendo Switch version of Hades as the second highest rated game of 2020, only behind Persona 5 Royal. Chris Carter of Destructoid acclaimed the game, calling it a masterpiece. He described the game as \\"A hallmark of excellence,\\" saying, \\"There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage\\". Carter particularly praised the game's visuals, combat improvements from the game's predecessor, as well as the \\"dramatic chase sequences\\". However, he mentioned some frame rate issues regarding the Xbox One version of the game. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Michael Goroff stated positive opinions regarding the game, while pointing out the performance issues which the Xbox One edition of the game suffered from before the day-one patch was released. Goroff further mentioned that \\"Ori and the Will of the Wisps does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines The Blind Forests mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with 'emotional platformers', Will of the Wisps doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience\\". Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner praised the game's graphics, story and combat, subsequently calling the game better than its predecessor. Reiner said, \\"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with Will of the Wisps, delivering an experience that doesn't have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\\" GameSpots critic, Steve Watts, gave the game a positive review, commending the combat, exploring elements, story as well as the \\"Gorgeous animation and environments.\\" Moreover, he highlighted occasional visual bugs as negative aspects of the game. Austin Wood, reviewer for GamesRadar+, acclaimed the game and its \\"breathtaking music,\\" world and its platforming. Wood stated that \\"There are a few minor stumbles here and there, but make no mistake: I adore Ori and The Will of the Wisps. It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \\"slightly underwhelming\\". Brandin Tyrrel of IGN also praised the game, saying that \\"Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor. PC Gamers critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. However, Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting, saying, \\"it's not much fun\\". Writing for VideoGamer, Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \\"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \\"thin\\". Tola Onanuga of The Guardian praised the game, saying that \\"More than anything else, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \\"melancholy at times\\" and stating that fighting \\"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying, \\"Peppered with devious puzzles, Ori and the Will of the Wisp[s] is an irresistible challenge. There is extraordinary attention to detail - the entire world feels alive with excitement and danger.\\" Game Informer listed Ori and the Will of the Wisps among the best games released throughout the eighth video game generation.

History  Between 1910 and 1911 the seminary was built and on October 18, 1911 students from the seminary in Pu≈∫niki (the first location of the La Salettes in Poland, currently an abandoned village in Ukraine) were moved to Dƒôbowiec. On September 15, 1912 the Missionaries opened and dedicated the first church, which quickly became a center of worship of Our Lady of La Salette in Poland. From that moment on the shrine and monastery in Dƒôbowiec became the mother church for the Missionaries of La Salette in Poland Services in honour of Our Lady of La Salette were introduced in September 1923 and, as of 2017, are still currently held. The initiator of the services was Fr. Andrew Skibinski M.S. In 1936 Missionaries began building a new church. The construction took them two years, but the shrine was not dedicated until 1941. The Missionaries petitioned for their church to be elevated to the rank of Minor Basilica in 2005. The Holy See's decree was signed on August 22, 2011. The shrine has been elevated on May 20, 2012 after a three-day celebration. After the Mass the Mayor of Dƒôbowiec, Zbigniew Staniszewski, said: = The Calvary = Three sets of figures representing the revelation of Our Lady of La Salette built in 1929.

Some of the figures were damaged during World War II and have visible bullet holes in them. = The Messenger of Our Lady of La Salette = In 1921, in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the revelations in La Salette, the Missionaries started issuing a bi-monthly journal titled \\"Messenger of Our Lady of La Salette\\".

It was long the seat of the Trelawny family, later Trelawny baronets, one of the most eminent of Cornish gentry families, much of whose political power derived from their control of the pocket borough of nearby East Looe.History of Parliament: House of Commons 1715-1754, ed. R. Sedgwick, 1970 The surviving grade II* listed manor house known as Trelawne House is today used for holiday accommodation and entertainment, under the name \\"Trelawne Manor Holiday Park\\". Trelawne manor Trelawne manor dates back to Norman times when it was held by Rainald de Vautort. It later passed in turn to the Cardinans, the Chapernouns and the Bonvilles. In 1554 the estate was confiscated from Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane Grey and sold in 1600 to Sir Jonathan Trelawny. It then passed down in the Trelawny and Salusbury-Trelawny families for several generations, many of whom were MPs for the local pocket constituencies of East and West Looe, Sheriffs of Cornwall and Lord- lieutenants of the county. Since John Trelawny, son of the original purchaser, who was created a baronet in 1628, there has been an unbroken series of 14 Trelawny or Salusbury-Trelawny baronets. Trelawne House The Grade II* listed house, which includes elements dating from the late 13th century, has been extended and remodelled several times since then. The entrance tower and hall, since remodelled, was built c.1450 for the Bonville family. The west range was added in c.1700 and there were at one time similar ranges to the east and south. After a fire c.1759 a new south east wing was added by Edward Trelawny. In 1860‚Äì62 Sir John Trelawny commissioned the rebuilding of the chapel and the south front. For five years from 1767 to 1772 the house stood empty because the owner, Sir William Trelawny, 6th Baronet, was Governor of Jamaica and there was much debate as to whether the window tax was therefore payable. It was eventually decided that it was. In the 1960s the estate became a holiday caravan park.

The Nezaks enter the historical record in the late 5th century, with their minting of coins in Ghazni, which had previously been controlled by the Sassanian Persians, the Indo-Sasanians. Their emergence may have been a consequence of the weakening of Persian influence in the region after the defeat of the Persian king Peroz by the Hephthalites (a people related to the Nezak), in Bactria in 484 CE. From that point, the Nezaks consolidated their power in Zabulistan and in the 6th century expanded into Kabulistan, deposing the Alchon Huns from Kapisa. Nezak coins with the bull's crown appear well into the 8th century, at which time it appears that a confederacy emerges between the Nezaks and the Alchons, possibly against Turkic invaders. =Alchon retreat from India= \\"Alchon- Nezak Crossover\\" coinage, 580-680. Nezak-style bust on the obverse, and Alchon tamga within double border on the reverse. Around the middle of the 6th century CE, the Alchons, after having extensively invaded the heartland of India, had withdrawn from Kashmir, Punjab and Gandhara, and going back west across the Khyber pass they resettled in Kabulistan. There, their coinage suggests that they merged with the Nezak Huns.Coin Cabinet of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna Eventually, the Nezak-Alchons were replaced by the Turk shahi dynasty, first in Zabulistan and then in Kabulistan. The last Nezak king known by name was Ghar-ilchi, who was confirmed by the Chinese emperor. Between 661 and 665, Chinese and Arab sources indicate that a new Turkic ruler became Shah of Kabul. Having lost Ghazni and Kabul, the Nezak dynasty declined rapidly as indicated by the progressive elimination of Nezak symbols from the historical coin record.
