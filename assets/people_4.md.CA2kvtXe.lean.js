The city is situated on the banks of the river Oude Rijn (Old Rhine), where the river Gouwe branches off. The municipality had a population of in , and covers an area of of which is water. The municipality of Alphen aan den Rijn also includes the communities of Aarlanderveen, Zwammerdam, and Boskoop. The city is located in what is called the 'Green Heart' of the Netherlands, which is a somewhat less densely populated centre area of the Randstad. The name \\"Alphen\\" is probably derived from the name of the Roman fort Albaniana, meaning \\"settlement at the white water\\". Its remains still lie underneath the city centre. History Map showing Albanianis (in the centre, just above the 'T' of Patabus) in the Tabula Peutingeriana. The area around Alphen aan den Rijn has been inhabited for 2000 years. In the Roman era, the Oude Rijn was the main branch of the Rhine River and formed the north border of the Roman Empire. Since the rule of Emperor Claudius (41‚Äì54 AD), divisions of the Roman army were stationed here. Consequently, several Roman fortifications were located along the Oude Rijn, including castellum Albanianae in the centre of Alphen. The Romans had also built the first bridge over the Oude Rijn. Alphen was therefore an important commercial site in the area until Germanic raids ended that in 240 AD. After recurring problems with flooding, especially in Utrecht and Leiden, the Oude Rijn was dammed at Wijk bij Duurstede in 1122, thereby making the Lek River the main branch of the Rhine. The Oude Rijn has not flooded since. During the Middle Ages, Alphen was a fiefdom called Alphen en Rietveld. The vertical lift bridge over the Gouwe River was built in the 1930s. In the 17th century, Alphen became prominent again as a hub for commerce. The Oude Rijn was used for boat traffic; there are still portions along the river where the towpath is present. The current municipality was formed in 1918 through the amalgamation of the smaller municipalities of Alphen, Aarlanderveen, and Oudshoorn. In 1964, the municipality of Zwammerdam was added as well. In 2014 the municipalities of Boskoop and Rijnwoude were amalgamated as well, doubling the land area and increasing the population to over 100,000. During the Second World War, the majority of Jews from Alphen were deported and subsequently murdered; only a few survived. After the war, the Jewish congregation was disbanded and merged with the one in Leiden. A Jewish cemetery on the Aarkade was founded in 1802, but it was abandoned and razed in the 1960s, with the remains re-interred in Katwijk; in 2012, after fifteen years of community activism by local historian Anke Bakker and CDA council member Alice Besseling, a monument was installed and the area turned into a city park. Since the 1950s, the city began to grow rapidly. A large new neighbourhood was built on the north side and Alphen became mostly a commuter city. Other urban developments however did create local employment. Since the 1990s, a similar new development was built at the city's south side. Monumental clocktower in Alphen aan den Rijn Theater Castellum 200px In recent years, a large part of the city centre has undergone a full urban renewal. Many buildings from the 1950s and earlier have been demolished to make place for modern architecture. This \\"masterplan\\" included the addition of a new public square next to the riverbank, the construction of a performing arts theatre/cinema, an upgrade of local shops and the creation of pedestrian streets. As of 2006, all of these projects on the left riverbank Hoge Zijde have been finished and a new similar masterplan for the right riverbank Lage Zijde has been developed and is being executed now. On 9 April 2011, a gunman opened fire at a shopping centre in Alphen aan den Rijn, killing six people and subsequently taking his own life. On 3 August 2015, a newly built bridge flap of the under-renovation Juliana Bridge on the Oude Rijn collapsed. It was being hoisted by two cranes, different in size, floating on a pontoon that was not stabilized. It became unbalanced shortly after the lifting started, fell and collapsed onto buildings. There were no injuries and fatalities, many inhabitants having already cleared the area. In total 51 properties were damaged.

The former municipality covers an area of of which is water. The former municipality of Bodegraven also includes the communities Meije, and Nieuwerbrug. On January 1, 2011 Bodegraven merged with Reeuwijk to Bodegraven-Reeuwijk. Geography Bodegraven is centrally located in the Green Heart of the Randstad, roughly equally distant (about 30 km) from Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. It is surrounded by the municipalities (clockwise, starting in the north): Nieuwkoop, Woerden, Reeuwijk (former municipality), Boskoop, and Alphen aan den Rijn. The town is situated on both shores of the Oude Rijn, in which a set of locks are in the middle of town. The oldest part of town is the Reformed St. Gallus Church, on the north side of the river. History Bodegraven was already inhabited in the Roman Era. It was situated at the Roman Empire's northern border, the Limes Germanicus. As such, many army camps, ports, and roads were built by the Romans. Many settlements originated on the road along the Limes, including Bodegraven. Not much is known about Bodegraven after that. According to folklore, a lost map from 809 made reference to a fiefdom \\"Bodelo\\". There is certainty however that circa 1050 a small settlement had formed, probably near the current Dorpskerk (Village Church). After two centuries of dispute between the bishop of Utrecht and the Counts of Holland, Bodegraven eventually became part of Holland. In the late Middle Ages, large tracts of land around Bodegraven were prepared for cultivation by digging division ditches (kavelsloten) perpendicular to the rivers (such as Oude Rijn, Meije, and Oude Bodegrave) between land parcels and then ditches cross-wise some from and parallel to the rivers (achtersloten). This created the distinctive grid pattern of field divisions. Circa 1350, a lock was built at Bodegraven. In 1672 when war was declared between the Dutch Republic and England, France, M√ºnster, and Cologne, Bodegraven was just behind the Water Defense Line. The Water Line was inundated and formed a barrier to the advancing French troops. But during the winter the French could advance over the frozen polders to Meije and Zwammerdam. Before reaching Alphen aan den Rijn they could be repelled by the Dutch. Thaw had set in so the only retreat route was along the dike of the Oude Rijn. The French therefore came through Bodegraven and destroyed it. Afterwards, the fort Wierickerschans was built just east of the town. Street scene in Bodegraven. Until 1870 Bodegraven prospered. But in that year fire broke out in a bakery which subsequently burnt a large part of the town. In all a 100 homes had burnt down and 130 families were homeless. A national collection was held and the town quickly recovered. In the 20th century, Bodegraven expanded: the southside between the Oude Rijn and the railway was built up circa 1900, the northside between the World Wars, and since the 1950s the area between the railway and the A12 Motorway has been built up. Economy Bodegraven is known as a centre for the cheese trade, controlled by the powerful Goebel family, though the number of cheese warehouses has decreased and, the Tuesday Cheese Market is no longer held since 2001. There still is a cheese museum and a cheese monument in front of the church. It was also known for its shampoo because of the Andr√©lon Factory, founded in the 1940s by barber Andr√© de Jong. In 2005 the factory closed and was demolished. Bodegraven has a strategic location in the middle of the Green Heart, resulting in a relative high number of industries located here. There is a picturesque historic windmill located in the town, which dates from the late seventeenth century and is now known as \\"De Arkduif\\" (the 'ark-dove' of the biblical Noah's Ark story). This currently houses a small brewery called Brouwerij De Molen. Transportation The A12 Motorway, running next to Bodegraven, connects The Hague via Utrecht and Arnhem to the German border. The State Highway N11 connects the A12 with the A4 Motorway at Leiden. =Railway= Railway Station: Bodegraven. There is a train between Leiden and Utrecht stopping in Bodegraven, twice in the hour. =Bus= There is only one bus (Line 178) in Bodegraven, connecting it with Reeuwijk and Gouda.

A second local bus (Line 722) connects Alphen aan den Rijn and Bodegraven via Zwammerdam. A steam tram formerly ran between Bodegraven and Gouda.

Rose Garden of Boskoop. Boskoop () is a town in the province of South Holland. It was a separate municipality until it merged into Alphen aan den Rijn in 2014. The town had a population of 15,050 in 2012 and covers an area of of which is water. It's the world's biggest joined floriculture area. Boskoop is famous for its nurseries, particularly woody plant and perennial nurseries, of which some 774 are situated on long stretches of land, divided by narrow canals. Before World War II almost all transport was conducted using narrow boats. A few exceptionally high footbridges crossing some of the broader (main) canals remain from these days. Between the World Wars the transition was made from fruit culture to decorative garden plants and trees. As a source of technical knowledge about the art of growing decorative plants, Boskoop remains world-renowned and unique. The name \\"Boskoop\\" has been given to an apple cultivar (Belle de Boskoop) which is widely distributed in the Low Countries, to a grape variety (Boskoop Glory) and also to a variety of Calluna (Boskoop) and Weigela (Boskoop Glory) and blackcurrant (\\"Boskoop Giant\\"). Geography Boskoop is located in the Green Heart (nl: Groene Hart) of the Randstad, spanning both sides of the river Gouwe between Alphen aan den Rijn (to the north) and Waddinxveen (to the south), both also along the river. The municipality is bordered in the east by Reeuwijk and Bodegraven, and in the west by Rijnwoude. A vertical lift bridge in the centre of the village connects both shores of the Gouwe. History It is assumed that Boskoop originated from the settlement Ten Bussche, founded by William I, Count of Holland, in 1204. In 1222, the Abbey of Rijnsburg became owner of Boskoop. The Abbey decided to enlarge its tree and shrub inventory by making the farmers grow more trees than they would need for their own orchards. From the 15th to the 17th century more and more trees were produced and decorative plants were introduced. At the end of the 19th century, Boskoop began with the export of its products, Germany being its first client. The history of Boskoop was greatly influenced by its location on top of a thick peat layer. When the Abbey of Rijnsburg became owners of Boskoop, the harvesting of peat for fuel began. But unlike other towns in the \\"Green Heart\\" where extensive peat harvesting led to the formation of large ponds and lakes, Boskoop was too far from the major cities and peat harvesting was not profitable. Also the abbey did not permit the excavation of the peat layer on its lands. So Boskoop still has fertile soil for agriculture and horticulture. An obstacle to the arboriculture was the high groundwater level, which was just below the surface at Boskoop. Many canals and ditches were dug to drain the rain waters, up to 2000 km at one point in its history. Consequently, much transportation was done by means of these waterways. By introducing new drainage methods which lowered the groundwater level, many ditches could be filled again. Yet at the beginning of the 21st century, there are still many canals in Boskoop on which many nurseries rely for transportation. As a result, Boskoop is sometimes called \\"Small Giethoorn\\". Nowadays, most plants are grown directly in pots, as opposed to open ground, and shipped to auction directly from the nursery. The viability of the nursery industry in Boskoop is also at risk, as nursery production has switched to container production, as opposed to field growing. The small size of the nurseries, the inability to mechanize, government regulations, the high cost of land, and the high cost of labor have all increased the economic pressure on the Boskoop nursery industry. The municipality of Boskoop had been in financial straits for the several years, in part because of the high cost of maintaining the constantly sinking roads, before it was amalgamated into Alphen aan den Rijn. On 1 January 2014 the municipality was merged into Alphen aan den Rijn at the same time as Rijnwoude. When it was dissolved, the municipality had a population of 15,196 and a total area of . Transport Boskoop is served by Boskoop railway station, which is in the west part of town. In 2017, Boskoop Snijdelwijk railway station was opened. Boskoop is connected to the RijnGouweLijn, which runs from Alphen aan den Rijn to Gouda. Trains travel every thirty minutes in either direction. In peak hours, an additional two trains travel every hour in the directions of Gouda and Leiden. Attractions The vertical-lift bridge at Boskoop is one of three similar bridges over the Gouwe; the other two are in Alphen aan den Rijn and Waddinxveen. Because of its central location, the bridge characterizes the village skyline. A new bicycle path was added to the bridge during its renovation at the beginning of the 1990s. Another historic building is the (now partially dismantled) Water Tower of Boskoop. It is located on the north-east side of the village on the same road crossing the lift bridge. Near the train station is an extensive rose garden (rosarium), with free access and open the whole year. More than 160 types of roses are exhibited here together with numerous other shrubs, trees, and plants. In view of its history, it is not surprising Boskoop has a nursery museum. It is located in an old nursery residence from 1870. Behind the museum is another rose garden with rose varieties from the 17th to the 20th century. From spring to fall, boat tours are organized through the many canals of Boskoop, which tour along the nurseries and nature areas and provide information about the history and surroundings of Boskoop. And once per year, a nursery canoe tour is organized.

It is located about 10 km east of Dordrecht, on the river Beneden-Merwede. The municipality had a population of in and covers an area of of which is water. The municipality of Hardinxveld-Giessendam consists of the two population centres Giessendam/Neder-Hardinxveld and Boven-Hardinxveld. Until they were merged in 1957, Giessendam and Hardinxveld were two municipalities, consisting of only a few streets and dykes and only a few thousand inhabitants. The town's economy is for a large part dependent on ship building (e.g. Damen Shipyards Group) and general contracting. Several industry parks are present. History  The village Hardinxveld is one of the oldest settlements of the Alblasserwaard. It is known that in 1105 a priest was present here, and therefore a church as well. Since 1282, Hardinxveld became a grand fiefdom. Through the centuries it suffered from warfare such as the Gelder Wars and the Eighty Years' War The name Giessendam first appeared in 1231 and is most likely derived from the dam on the little peat river Giessen. This dam was the boundary between Hardinxveld and Giessendam for a long time. The municipality was formed in 1957 by the merger of the former municipalities Hardinxveld and half of Giessendam. The rest of Giessendam's territory went to the new municipality of Giessenburg which in turn was merged with Giessenlanden in 1986. Since the 1960s, the municipality has grown significantly through the development of new neighbourhoods such as De Peulen, de Wielwijk, de Westwijk, and Tienmorgen. In recent years, the municipality had serious fiscal problems, resulting in direct oversight by the Province for a period of time. Considerable savings had to be made, necessitating significant increases to the relative low taxation in the town. Archeology Before the construction of the Betuweroute Highspeed Railway, thorough soil research was performed in 1997. During that research in Hardinxveld-Giessendam, some archeological items were found, including a 7500-year-old skeleton of a woman, now named \\"Trijntje\\". It is the oldest skeleton found in the Netherlands up to this time. Since December 2003, the reconstructed corpse has been added to the collection of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden (National Museum of Antiquities) in Leiden. In April 1998, a dugout canoe was found.

Agriculture and animal husbandry were the only means of existence for many centuries. All lands were owned by or in control of the nobility of Dordrecht. Not until the Eighty Years' War some industrial activities began to appear along the river dike. Furthermore, horticulture and flax growing also developed. Because of the rapid industrial growth in Germany and the daily tides, two citizens of Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht started a ship breaking yard which grew into an industry resulting in the town becoming worldwide known as the \\"ship breaking village\\". The establishment of industries in the region changed the centuries-old seasonal labour to permanent work opportunities with higher wages.

Hillegom is part of an area called the Duin- en Bollenstreek (\\"Dune and Bulb Region\\"). As such, a large portion of the local economy was traditionally geared to the cultivation of bulb flowers. The name Hillegom is derived from the abbey named Hijlighem (Old Frankish for \\"Holy Home\\"). This abbey no longer exists. The current Lord of Hillegom is Jan Six X. History Hillegom was formed on the eastern edge of the coastal dunes where the old Leiden to Haarlem route crossed the Hillegommerbeek (Hillegom's Creek), not far from the shores of the Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem's Lake). Places with the suffix \\"-heim\\" (or variant spellings) usually developed before the year 1000 and therefore it is assumed that this may apply to Hillegom as well. In 1150 the abbot of Egmond had the rights to naming priests in Hillegom, indicating that a church or chapel existed there. In 1248 the count Willem II gave the Chapel of Hijllinghem and all its buildings to the Abbot of Egmond. In the middle of the 14th century, Hillegom gained some prominence when the counts of Holland convened there 3 times for council. In 1369, there were 46 houses with a population of 283, growing to 67 houses and 412 people in 1477. During the Eighty Years' War, Hillegom found itself several times between the opposing Spanish and Dutch Rebel armies, resulting in its near destruction in 1577. But after the middle of the 17th century, the area became prosperous through the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, growing on the sandy soil of fields dug out the dunes. In 1722, the rich Amsterdam merchant Jan Six II bought the fiefdom Hillegom and built improvements, including a stone bridge over the Hillegommerbeek and a pump in the village square as well as paving a portion of the main road. In 1749, he purchased Het Hof (The Courtyard), an estate in the centre of Hillegom. At this time, there were many other estates of rich merchants and stadtholders in Hillegom, such as Bethlehem, Oostende, Horstendael, Weeresteyn, Treslong, Duin en Weg, Meer en Dorp, Het Hof, Lapinenburg and Elsbroek (many of these names survive as neighborhood names). The population grew to 930 in 1732 and to 1050 in 1795. In 1855 Hillegom absorbed the former municipality of De Vennip. During the 19th century, the beauty of the area and its estates slowly began to disappear. Developers bought the estates, cut down the forests, and excavated the sand dunes to create fields for bulb flower cultivation. This process accelerated in 1904 when a lime-sand brick factory was built just south of Hillegom, which needed large amounts of sand. By the early 1920s, all estates had disappeared, except for Het Hof which became Hillegom's town hall. This same period saw the rapid growth of the bulb flower industry and Hillegom's population, up to 8800 in 1916. Hillegom's convenient location led to another rapid growth period during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, when many new neighborhoods were built to accommodate families working in either Haarlem, Amsterdam, or Leiden. Its economy became less dependent on the bulb flower trade and more diversified with the establishment of a few business parks. Geography Dutch Topographic map of Hillegom, June 2015 Hillegom is bordered by the municipalities of Bloemendaal (and formerly Bennebroek) to the north, Haarlemmermeer to the east, Lisse to the south, and Noordwijk (formerly Noordwijkerhout) to the west.

The Hillegommerbeek (Hillegom's Creek) was used to transport goods from the town to Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem's Lake) and, after its reclamation, to the Ringvaart. Several docks and wharfs still line the creek and canal. The Leidsevaart (Leiden Canal) was completed in 1657 and runs between Leiden and Haarlem just west of Hillegom. This canal has fallen in disuse because of its many non-operable bridges. Hillegom is served by Provincial Roads 207, 208, and 442. =Railway= Bulb flower fields near Hillegom. Hillegom is served by Hillegom railway station, with direct connections to Haarlem in the north and Leiden and The Hague southward. Tourism and attractions The most interesting time to visit is during the spring when the fields around Hillegom are in a colourful bloom. At this time a flower parade, the Bloemencorso, travels through its main streets. Hillegom was home to the Den Hartogh Ford Museum, which had the world's largest collection of Ford automobiles, until it closed down in 2016.

The municipality was merged with the municipalities of Vianen and Zederik on January 1, 2019. The name of the new municipality is Vijfheerenlanden which is a part of the province Utrecht. The former municipality Leerdam was a part of the province South Holland. The south border of the town is formed by the river Linge. The name originates from a dam in the river Lede which was a branch from the river Linge towards Meerkerk. Leerdam is situated almost exactly in the middle of the three highways A2, A15 and A27. History Leerdam received city rights in 1407. The small river Linge, bordered by beautiful water meadows, defines the atmosphere and tone of the landscape. Several centuries ago Leerdam formed a part of the Vijfheerenlanden domain, before it was raised to the level of County in 1498. In 1551, Leerdam, together with Acquoy, became property of the House of Orange and part of the County of Holland. The rich history of Leerdam can be found in well-kept historic buildings such as the Grote Kerk (Great Church), the Hofje van Mevrouw van Aerden (Mrs. Aerden Almshouses, now a museum), the remaining and restored city walls on the Zuidwal and the Oude Raadhuis (Old City Hall). In South Africa a fort was built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679 in the coastal city Cape Town. It is called Castle of Good Hope. The corners of this fort received names in honour of William of Orange-Nassau and because Leerdam was part of the House of Orange-Nassau one of those corners were named Leerdam.

The history of Lisse is closely related and similar to the neighboring towns of Hillegom and Sassenheim. Based on a document from 1198 which makes official mention of the town's name, Lisse celebrated its 800-year anniversary in 1998, although there is an indication that there was already a settlement there in the 10th century. In the Middle Ages, Lisse was a small settlement; there were only 50 houses in 1500. Because of prolonged warfare (particularly the wars of Charles the Bold and the Eighty Years' War), poverty was prevalent. Its population lived from agriculture, animal husbandry, and peat harvesting. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Lisse was, like Hillegom, home to many estates of rich merchants and nobility. The forests and gardens of the Keukenhof, Meerenburg, Wildlust, Zandvliet, Overduin en Akervoorde, Wassergeest, Grotenhof, Ter Specke, Dubbelhoven, Rosendaal, Veenenburg en Berkhout, Middelburg, Ter Beek, and Uytermeer estates all added to the town's beauty and glory. Yet in the following centuries, every one of these estates (except Keukenhof) was removed to make way for the cultivation of bulb flowers. The sandy soil in Lisse's surroundings were highly suitable for its growth provided the soil was fertilized. The nearby dunes were excavated and forests cut down progressively over time for more fields for the flower business. This brought employment and prosperity to this area.  Floriculture centre  Dutch Topographic map of Lisse, June 2015 A field of tulips in Lisse In the 20th century, the bulb flower business continued to boom, resulting in the establishment of auction and trading houses, large-scale cultivators and cooperatives. Today, Lisse exports bulbflowers in large quantities to over a hundred countries worldwide. Located at the centre of the \\"Dune and Bulb Region\\" (Duin- en Bollenstreek), Holland's flower-growing region, Lisse is also a major tourist attraction. During the spring when the fields around Lisse are in a colourful bloom, hundreds of thousands of local and foreign tourists visit the area. The only remaining estate that was not removed for flower cultivation (Keukenhof) became world-famous for its flower displays. Tourism and attractions The most popular attraction in Lisse is Keukenhof, open only during spring when the tulips are flowering. Also each spring a flower parade called the Bollenstreek Bloemencorso is held through the main streets of Lisse. In August the fantasy festival Castlefest is held in the gardens of Castle Keukenhof.

The first signs of a community started back in 925 when the area became part of the county of Graaf Dirk II and a church was built. After severe floodings during the 12th century, the Maasdijk was rebuilt and the town centre relocated to its current site. In 1241 the German Teutonic Knights drew on the territory of Maasland. In 1450 the 'Poldermolen' (translation: Poldermill) was built in Maasland (see picture). During the war between Spain and the Netherlands a huge area of the Netherlands was flooded which was part of the strategy of Willem van Oranje. In 1574, these floodings affected Maasland, and once again the town was flooded. It took a couple of years before the town was rebuilt and in 1614 part of the town Maasland (which included the Maeslandsluys) gained independency and is known as Maassluis. Until the new townhall was built in 1874 meetings of the city council meetings were held in the tavern 'de Pynas'. In the late 20th century the town of Maasland and its surrounding communities were governed as the municipality (gemeente) of Maasland, with most governmental functions based in the town.

The municipality had a population of in and covers of which water. It received city rights in 1811. History Maassluis in 1867. Maassluis was founded circa 1340 as a settlement next to a lock (in Dutch: sluis) in the sea barrier between the North Sea and Rotterdam. Originally Maeslandsluys, it was part of Maesland. In 1489 the settlement was sacked. During the Eighty Years' War, Philips of Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde, started to build a defense wall but before its completion, the Spanish captured it in 1573 and Philips of Marnix was taken prisoner. A year later Maeslandsluys was looted by mutinous Spanish troops. On 16 May 1614, Maeslandsluys was separated from Maesland by the counts of Holland and renamed Maassluis. This separation may have been religiously motivated: Maassluis was predominantly Protestant and Maasland Catholic. In 1624 the defense wall was demolished to make way for the Great Church, started in 1629. Construction stopped for five years because privateers from Dunkirk raided fishing boats from Maassluis, throwing their crew overboard. It was finished in 1639. On 4 December 1732, the Garrels Organ was inaugurated. Built from 1730 to 1732 by Rudolf Garrels, a pupil of Arp Schnitger, it was a gift by Govert van Wijn, ship-owner from Maassluis. In 1811 Napoleon Bonaparte granted city rights. During World War II, the working population was transferred to Germany for the war industry. Maassluis' ancient church was hit by allied bombers. Dutch Topographic map of Maassluis, June 2015 Church: de Grote Kerk =Jewish history= The Jewish community had its own synagogue, a teacher, a singer and a ritual butcher. Its most common professions were salesman, street trader and butcher. The economy was vulnerable and community growth ended with the industrial revolution. The area became easier to reach and competition became too much. The number of Jews fell from 92 to eight between 1892 and 1930. A cause was the building of a railway in 1881 between Maassluis and Rotterdam. Most Jewish traders moved to Rotterdam, The Hague and Amsterdam, which in the last decade of the 19th century had a growing Jewish population. Integration in Maassluis ended during the Second World War. The Coltof and Van Gelderen families were deported in 1942 and murdered in Auschwitz. Economy Maassluis was historically dependent on the fishing near the coast and off Iceland. In the 19th century the tugboat company, L. Smit, and the marine salvage company W.A. van den Tak merged to become Smit-Tak, now a division of the world's largest salvage company, Smit International. Also, there is still a large shipping agency called Royal Dirkzwager. Maassluis is now mainly a commuter town for Rotterdam.

New York Mills Regional Cultural Center =New York Mills Regional Cultural Center= Faced with the economic challenges and decreasing population of many rural communities, New York Mills decided to invest in a Regional Arts Center in an attempt to bring tourism to the area. In 1991 the city contributed $35,000 to the Regional Arts Retreat and Cultural Center to convert a downtown mercantile building into a multi-use arts and cultural facility. As a per-capita investment, this expenditure would be the equivalent of Minneapolis giving $13.7 million to an arts facility. The center, remodeled through a community-wide volunteer effort, opened its doors in June, 1992, as a non-profit Arts organization founded by John Davis. Further renovations include a new hardwood maple floor in the main gallery and an outdoor deck completed in 2005. While other communities withered in the face of declining populations and deteriorating main streets, New York Mills has remained stable economically, while the Cultural Center continues to draw people, activity, revenue and national attention to the community.

The former municipality included the population centres of Nieuw-Lekkerland (divided into the two neighbourhoods Dorpslaan and Middelweg) and Kinderdijk. The town's name evolved slightly over time: in 1280 Leckerlant, in 1331 Niewe Leckerland, and in 1903 Nieuw Lekkerland. It means \\"land of or near the river Lek\\" with the addition of \\"nieuw\\" (\\"new\\") to distinguish it from Old Lekkerland (now Lekkerkerk) across the river. History The name Nieue-Leckelant appears for the first time around 1325 and distinguishes it from Oudt-Leckelant (now Lekkerkerk). The most notable building used to be Castle Schoonenburg. Because of its elevated location on a mount, it served as a refuge for the people during floods before the reclamation of the Alblasserwaard. After 1456, the castle was abandoned and became a ruin. Its remains were thereafter probably used to rebuild a church tower. only the mount is still visible. The Reformed Church is from 1848. Its economy was based on agriculture, cattle raising, and fishing. In the 19th century ship building and industry developed, resulting in an increasing population: from 770 in 1820, 1153 in 1840, 2000 in 1867, to 9400 in 2004. Till 2013, Nieuw-Lekkerland was one of the few remaining municipalities in the Alblasserwaard that never merged with any other municipality.

It is the hometown of Miss Universe 1989, Angela Visser. History Monument to the plugging of the dike hole by skipper Evegroen during the North Sea Flood of 1953 Nieuwerkerk was probably first formed circa 1250. The first reference to \\"Nuwekerke\\" is from 1282 when Count Floris V loaned the land between Kralingen and Gouda to a certain Traveys of Moordrecht. Another reference is from 22 January 1317 when Count William III of Holland sold the fiefdoms Capelle and Nieuwerkerk to John III van de Werve, Lord of Hovorst for 325 Dutch Pounds. The original old village formed on a mount between shallow lakes. These lakes were the result of peat harvesting. In 1839 the first one was drained and made into a polder, the current Zuidplaspolder, and in 1866, the Alexanderpolder was made. The railway between Rotterdam and Gouda was built in 1855 and resulted in the growth of the village. Other periods of rapid development followed after the Second World War and in the early 1980s. During the North Sea Flood of 1953, a dike along that river broke, and the mayor of Nieuwerkerk successfully managed to plug the hole by ordering shipper Arie Evegroen to navigate his grain barge Twee Gebroeders (Two Brothers) into it.Heroes of February 1953 Flood finally recognized for saving untold lives, goDutch.com, Feb 09, 2009 Transport * Railway station: Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel  References   External links *Map of the town *Official website of Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel (in Dutch) Category:Former municipalities of South Holland Category:Populated places in South Holland Category:Zuidplas ","title":"Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel"},{"id":"121162","text":"Newton Township is a township in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, United States.

Communities The municipality of Noordwijk consists of the communities Noordwijk aan Zee and Noordwijk-Binnen, separated by a narrow green belt, as well as Noordwijkerhout and De Zilk. =Noordwijk aan Zee= The Noordwijk Lighthouse landmark Noordwijk aan Zee was founded around 1200 as a fishing village. Until the beginning of the 19th century, fishing remained its primary business, but then began to be replaced by the growing tourism industry. Nowadays because of its long sandy beaches, it is a popular resort town with 1,000,000 overnight stays per year. It has a lighthouse and a KNRM rescue station. Furthermore, it has a reformed church (1647) with a pulpit from the 17th century. Noordwijk aan Zee is rated as the 12th richest location in the Netherlands. Beer magnate Freddy Heineken has built a villa there with the characteristic green roof. A small part of the indigenous population of Noordwijk aan Zee speaks Noordwijks, a very original Dutch dialect, which sounds like Katwijks, but in Noordwijk the dialect is almost gone, compared to Katwijk, where more people speak in (partly) dialect. =Noordwijk-Binnen= View over Noordwijk-Binnen, with two church towers. Because of the martyrdom of Priest Jeroen in 857, the Archbishop of Utrecht made Noordwijk-Binnen a pilgrimage location in 1429. Both the Catholic and Protestant churches here are named after this priest. Noordwijk-Binnen has retained its historic character and is therefore protected by the Dutch Monument Law. An interesting historic view is shown by the picture of Gerard van der Laan with the view to the Jeroenskerk. In the foreground is a canal with two sailboats for inland waterways. The area around Noordwijk-Binnen has long been an important part of the regional bulb flower industry. The dunes were dug out and transformed into fields for the cultivation of bulb flowers. The territory of Noordwijk still exists for a large part from spirit grounds. The bulb region is formed of Noordwijk together with surrounding municipalities. =Noordwijkerhout= Nature North (and to a lesser extent south) of Noordwijk spreads a relatively vast dune area, in which a varied wild flora and fauna (with among others pine forests and deer) is observable for bikers, walkers and gallopers. North of Noordwijk, large areas of dunes are covered by the natura 2000 act. Part of which holds house to the Kennemer Zweefvlieg Club.

Some 80 bunkers and underground structures housed 180 soldiers, and were connected by 400 metres (a quarter-mile) of tunnels, equipped with narrow rail-tracks for moving heavy ammunition. The central, S414 design, fire command bunker alone counts three-man-high stories deep, and with walls up to thick, it consists of more than 1,800 m¬≥ of concrete ‚Äì the equivalent content of some 300 modern cement trucks. Four heavy gun bunkers housed 155mm cannons and doubled as living quarters. Two other large bunkers stored ammunition.Batterie Noordwijk ‚Äì Atlantikwall The fire control bunker offered an excellent view of the coastal sea, used for observation and ballistic trajectory calculation, to control the entire gun battery. In 2001, the central command bunker was reopened as a museum, refitted with mostly original equipment. Because the Germans kept the men busy building further bunkers, pill-boxes, etc., by war's end the complex counted almost one underground structure for every two men.

Its population was in .  Etymology  The portion geest in the name refers to the geest lands, which were excavated in the seventeenth century for the benefit of the urban expansion of Leiden. There exists more uncertainty about the 'Oegst' part. There are various stories. The name was formerly often spelled Oestgeest or Oostgeest, which could indicate the geographical location of the village: east of the geest lands. However, the oldest spelling found in a copy of a list of goods of the St. Martin's Cathedral in Utrecht from the tenth century states Osgeresgeest. This could indicate an original resident and owner of the territory: Osger. In the Middle Ages they also spoke of the Church of Kerckwerve if one referred to the Oegstgeester parish church (now the Green Church). History Oegstgeest is one of the earliest inhabited places along the coast. Evidence of a Batavian settlement from the second century was found in 1946 in an extension of a coastal dune in the Elgeesterpolder, although it is not certain whether this location remained permanently inhabited in the centuries after that. By the 9th century, there was already a little church in the same location as the current Little Green Church (Groen Kerkje) which, according to legend, was dedicated by Willibrord. The existence of this church is an indication that there may have been a community there. From the 11th to the 14th century, Oegstgeest enjoyed a period of progress. This ended when Leiden was granted city rights. The carrying out of trades and construction were no longer permitted within a certain distance from the city. In 1399, the heerlijkheid of Oegstgeest and that of Poelgeest were merged because their declining populations could no longer afford to pay the required taxes to the Count of Holland. Oegstgeest in 1867 Oud Poelgeest Until the 19th century the boundary of Oegstgeest extended right to the city walls and moats of Leiden. But in the 19th and 20th century, it conceded more and more of its territory to the rapidly expanding city of Leiden. Before the early 20th century, Oegstgeest had a rural character and did not have a centre of population. It consisted of several unconnected smaller settlements. Only after 1900 were new neighbourhoods built between the settlements. First Wilhelminapark was built, followed by Prins Hendrikpark (circa 1915), Buitenlust or Indische Buurt (1925), Julianapark, Oranjepark, and Emmapark (1920-1950), and Grunerie and the area between Emmalaan and Lange Voort (1950s). In the 1980s and 1990s, the Haaswijk and Morsebel neighbourhoods were built, followed by Poelgeest in the 2000s. In 2006 construction started on a new neighbourhood, Nieuw Rhijngeest.

History Oud-Beijerland in 1866 Dutch Topographic map of the town of Oud-Beijerland, June 2015 After the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421), large parts of the islands Putten and Grote Waard were lost and became clay banks and salt marshes which would be inundated at high tide and be unsuitable for habitation. In subsequent centuries, portions of land would be reclaimed. Oud-Beijerland was formed in 1559 as \\"Beijerland\\" by Lamoral, Count of Egmont. He was granted the rights to this area in 1557 and had the land reclaimed. This new polder was named Beijerland, Moerkerken, Cromstrijen en de Greup. Circa 1624 the smaller polders Bosschenpolder and Nieuwlandpolder were added to it. Beijerland was named after Sabina of Bavaria (Dutch: Beijeren), wife of the Count of Egmont. In 1582 the name was changed to Oud-Beijerland, in order to distinguish it from Nieuw-Beijerland which was formed several kilometers to the west. In 1604 the village got its churchtower from Sabina van Beijeren, and in 1622 the town hall was built. Oud-Beijerland then became one of the most important market places of the Hoeksche Waard. Its economy was dependent on trade, industry, agriculture and fishing. This brought prosperity which is still reflected in the elegant mansions along the Vliet. From the end of the 19th century until ca. 1955, a tram connected Oud-Beijerland with Rotterdam. The tram was nicknamed \\"Het Moordenaartje\\" (The Little Murderer) because of the high rate of casualties involved with its operation.

Later about 900 there was a stronghold, which could explain the current name of the village Rijnsburg, which means 'Rhine fortress' Rijnsburg used to be a separated municipality until 1 January 2006, when, together with Valkenburg, it was added to the municipality and city of Katwijk. Before that, the municipality covered an area of of which is water, and had a population of 14851 inhabitants on 1 June 2005. Rijnsburg's main claim to fame is that the philosopher Spinoza lived there from 1661 to 1663. The modest house in which he lived is still preserved, and can be visited. Rijnsburg is located in an area called the \\"Dune and Bulb district\\" (Duin- en Bollenstreek) and is one of the locations of the flower auction company Royal FloraHolland. Rijnsburg Abbey was established by Petronilla of Lorraine, consort of Floris II, Count of Holland, in 1133. It flourished for many years. Two of her granddaughters, Sophie and Hedwig, would later join this abbey, one of them as abbess. = Archeological finds = Finds of the royalty on the Rhine, now exhibited in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden In 1913 a buckle, the mount with red, white and blue enamel, and the square coin were found together in a cemetery at Rijnsburg.

These finds amongst others indicate that the mouth of the Rhine was home to some people of very high status, perhaps even royalty. =Burials at Rijnsburg Abbey= * Floris the Black * Petronilla of Lorraine * Dirk VI, Count of Holland * William I, Count of Holland * Floris IV, Count of Holland Image:Rijnsburg, ophaalbrug met moderne panden foto2 2009-10-25 13.49.JPGRijnsburg, drawbridge and modern blocks Image:Rijnsburg, kerk foto4 2009-10-25 13.57.JPGRijnsburg, church References Category:Katwijk Category:Populated places in South Holland Category:Former municipalities of South Holland ","title":"Rijnsburg"},{"id":"121180","text":"Otter Tail Township is a township in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, United States.

It was the second-smallest municipality in the Netherlands in area (behind Bennebroek).

Its current form was created out of three separate parts: Rozenburg proper (a former sand bar between Het Scheur and Brielse Maas - part of the Nieuwe Maas river - both branches of the Rhine- Meuse delta), the sand bar Welplaat, and the southernmost part of the Hook of Holland (which was cut off from mainland Holland by the construction of the Nieuwe Waterweg ship canal in 1870 and subsequently was connected to Rozenburg when the remainder of Het Scheur was dammed off). The island is now connected to Voorne-Putten by a sea barrier and a dam. History Rozenburg Island was formed centuries ago from several sand bars in the mouth of the river Maas. In 1568 construction started on the first set of dikes and in 1586 the land known as Roosenburgh was leased to Dirk Ariensz. Bisdommer and Son, the first permanent inhabitant of Rozenburg. In 1950, the Nieuwe Maas (or Brielse Maas) was dammed off at both ends of Rozenburg Island, thereby forming Briel Lake and connecting it to Voorne-Putten Island. Beginning in the same period, most of the island was given to industrial enterprise, part of the Port of Rotterdam (Botlek and Europoort). When these sea ports were being planned in the 1950s, the councils of Rotterdam and Rozenburg made the arrangement that Rotterdam would lead the development of the ports and industry, whereas Rozenburg would take care of housing development for the expected population increase. The village of Blankenburg on the island had to be completely removed to make way for new canals and industry. The new housing developments were concentrated around the old village centre of Rozenburg on Het Scheur. In a short period its population rose from 3500 to over 14000. The Hook of Holland bit was extended with a large polder called Maasvlakte, which contains large sea harbours and petrochemical industry. There is a refinery located in Rozenburg. The Rozenburg refinery is now owned by Kuwait Petroleum Europort BV which is a subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum International, KPI.

The name Sassenheim consists of two parts; the first (Sassen) means Saxons, and the second portion (heim) is Old Frankish for \\"home\\". History The ruins of Castle Teylingen The name Sassenheim is mentioned in documents for the first time in 870 as Hostsagnem ('East Sassenheim') and Westsagnem ('West Sassenheim'). Later, in the 10th century, the name Saxnem, Zassenem or Sassem was used. It was formed between the towns of Leiden and Lisse on the eastern edge of the old coastal beach ridges where the main road from Leiden to Haarlem was located. Along this road many castles and estates were built, including the mansions along Sassenheim's Main Street (Hoofdstraat) dating from the early 1900s. The village church is built on a dune top and portrays a variety of construction styles. Sassenheim is located in an area called the \\"Dune and Bulb Region\\" (Duin- en Bollenstreek). Historically, Sassenheim had a large bulbflower industry but this has now all but disappeared, only a few fields remain. One of the most interesting attractions in Sassenheim are the ruins of Castle Teylingen. This stronghold was built to guard the north‚Äìsouth route in Holland and later became a residence of countess Jacoba of Bavaria. Its outer walls date from the beginning of the 13th century. Around 1570 during the Eighty Years' War, the castle was heavily damaged but rebuilt afterwards. It was bought by the State in 1889 and restored in 1900. Since World War II it has placed much emphasis on attracting light industry. The territory of Sassenheim is partly used for this purpose and partly for residential construction. The few bulbs lands owned by the municipality, have virtually disappeared. The many bulbs barns are almost all demolished. Trade and production have moved to areas outside Sassenheim. In the second half of the 20th century Sassenheim becomes a greater town with new districts around the historical town center, first in the Southeast and the West (during the 60s-70s) and later in the rest of the village. At December 11, 2011 the Train station of Sassenheim has opened nearby the freeway A44 .

It is the seat of the council of the municipality of Midden-Delfland. The village was founded relatively late in the 15th century and evolved around the Keenenburg castle, which no longer exists. The current Dutch Reformed church in the village centre belonged to the Catholic Teutonic Knights before 1572, when the Calvinists took over control of the church. The village inhabitants worked in the food trade from the agrarian area Westland to the cities of Vlaardingen and Delft. Most of the population became Roman Catholic in the 17th century. For sermons, they had to go to the Roman Catholic Church, some kilometres out of the village. In 1855, the municipality of Sint Maartensregt was merged into Schipluiden. A new Roman Catholic church was built in the 1960s. Schipluiden remained a small agrarian village until the 1950s.

Since 2015 it has been a part of the municipality of Krimpenerwaard. The former municipality had a population of in , and covered an area of of which water. From 2010 to 2014, it was the smallest municipality in the Netherlands in land area, following the merger of Rozenburg into Rotterdam. The first winner of the Dutch version of Pop Idol, Jamai Loman, is from this town. Also Jan-Arie van der Heijden, football player for Feyenoord, lives in Schoonhoven. History Circa 1220 a castle was built on the north side of a small stream called \\"Zevender\\", near its mouth at the Lek River. The city of Schoonhoven was then formed near the castle. The oldest reference to the city is in a document from 1247, where it is referred to as Sconhoven. In 1280, it was granted city rights. Around 1350, city walls and gates were constructed. The city's economy depended on shipping, brewing, fishing and agriculture. Schoonhoven was also the marketplace for the region. In 1518, the castle burned down and its remnants were removed in subsequent decades.Schoonhoven in 1652 by Joan Blaeu Between 1582 and 1601 the city's defense walls were renewed and expanded to include the shipyards as well. At this point, the fortifications mainly faced eastward (as can be seen on the 1652 map of Schoonhoven by Joan Blaeu), because of the historically strategical location on the border between the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht. Following the Disaster Year of 1672, they were reinforced once again and expanded on the west and north sides. Yet in 1816, when bastion fortifications were no longer relevant to the warfare of the time, they were mostly demolished and made way for a cemetery and a park. Nowadays, most of the city walls and gates too have disappeared. The only remaining medieval entrance gate of Schoonhoven is the Veerpoort (Ferry Gate) that faces the Lek River. This Veerpoort has protected Schoonhoven from the floods of the river Rhine and from the sea during the devastating North Sea flood of 1953 and is still fully functional as a water barrier today. By 1860, the city had 2900 inhabitants. Not until the middle of the 20th century did the city expand beyond the former fortress limits; firstly in a north-westerly direction, and then eastward since the 1990s. Tourism and attractions Schoonhoven is known for its silver and therefore carries the nickname: Zilverstad (\\"Silver City\\"). Since the 17th century, silver and gold smiths have been working here. Today, Schoonhoven is still known for its silver. It is the host of \\"Het Nederlands Zilvermuseum\\" (the Dutch Silver Museum) and the International Silver School. Schoonhoven is also known for is its production of clocks. There still is a variety of clock makers in Schoonhoven, some of which can be visited. A beautiful example of a large clockwork is the Van den Gheyn Beiaard in the tower of the medieval town hall of Schoonhoven. The city is a popular stop for inland cruise ships, especially during the summer period. Tourists are often offered a guided tour of the city and its museums, or a relaxing cycling day trip through Schoonhoven's rural surroundings. The town is also popular among Dutch day-trippers and bicycle tourers. The grassy polders of the Krimpenerwaard, Lopikerwaard and Alblasserwaard surrounding the city of Schoonhoven are home to a magnificent variety of birds such as storks. Popular events that take place in Schoonhoven include the annual well-visited Silver day (Zilverdag) on Whit Monday and \\"Spookhoven\\", a celebration of Halloween. Also, Koningsdag and the arrival of Sinterklaas are celebrated each year. Schoonhoven has two main shopping streets with a variety of shops and boutiques. There are several restaurants and bars, as well as a hotel and a discotheque.  Transport  Schoonhoven lies in the middle of the Dutch Green Heart (Groene Hart), which is mostly a rural area with a relatively low population density. It therefore has no railway connection (although there was a tram connection with Gouda from 1914 until 1942, when it was broken up by the German Nazi authorities) and lacks a direct connection to a motorway. The city can be reached within half an hour from the major cities of Rotterdam and Utrecht via the N210 road, and from Gouda via the N207. It also has a frequent bus connection (lines 195 and 197) with these cities. Amsterdam is about an hour away by car. A ferry transporting both vehicles and pedestrians across the Lek River connects Schoonhoven with Gelkenes in the municipality of Molenwaard. From here, the towns of Gorinchem, Dordrecht and Kinderdijk can each be reached within half an hour.

As of 2015, it is a part of the municipality of Krimpenerwaard.  Description  Vlist is named after the river with the same name, along which the population is concentrated. The river forms a connection between the Lek river and the city of Schoonhoven to Haastrecht, where it empties into the Hollandsche IJssel. It has a length of approximately 9 kilometres (5.6 miles). The Vlist was formerly used as a drainage basin for polders around the river; there were many windmills on the banks of the river, to pump water out of the adjacent polders and into the river. It was also used for the transport of goods, particularly from Schoonhoven to Utrecht. Today the river has a larger function in tourism, and is particularly popular among cyclists and pedestrians, who enjoy walking or riding along the river. The river itself is often navigated with canoes which can be rented in Haastrecht. If the river is sufficiently frozen in winter, the Two Provinces skating tour is organized for the ice-skate enthusiasts.  Arrest at Goejanverwellesluis  Famously, along the river Vlist, Wilhelmina of Prussia, was halted by patriots from Gouda while on her way to The Hague. She was planning to attempt to convince the States General to let her husband William V return to the city. The patriots tried to prevent this and she was then brought to a farm near the Goejanverwellesluis (in present Hekendorp). Afterwards, she was not allowed further passage into Holland and returned to Nijmegen without result. This event, that directly led to the invasion of the Dutch Republic by Frederick William II of Prussia and the fall of the patriots, occurred on June 28, 1787 and is (incorrectly, because it happened at Bonrepas) known as the Arrest at Goejanverwellesluis.

The former municipality covered an area of 12.59 km¬≤ (4.86 mile¬≤) of which 0.33 km¬≤ (0.13 mile¬≤) is covered by water, and had a population of 14,792 in 2004. Together with Sassenheim and Warmond, it became part of the Teylingen municipality on January 1, 2006. Voorhout is located in an area called the \\"Dune and Bulb Region\\" (Duin- en Bollenstreek). It also included the communities of Piet Gijzenbrug (partly) and Teijlingen with the Slot Teylingen. History Historic 1867 map of Voorhout In 1988 Voorhout celebrated its 1000th anniversary. A letter mentioning Voorhout from 988 had been preserved. This letter states that count Dirk II of Holland granted the church of ‚ÄúForanholte‚Äù (the old name of Voorhout) to the Egmond Abbey. The second part of the name ‚Äìholte or ‚Äìhout (meaning ‚Äúwood‚Äù) is a reference to the dune area that was supposedly very wooded at the time. Settlements arose around this area, and Voorhout arose in front of a forest. The nearby Noordwijkerhout also refers to this forest, just like Holland, which is a degeneration of Holtland, meaning woodland. The area was inhabited far before 988 with Roman coins from around 2000 years ago having been found. In 1907 at the Rijnsburgerweg a farmer found 18 bronze axes and 1 chisel, about 3500 years old. They are now on display in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden. Since 1150 the nobles of Teylingen take an important role in the area. In the Slot Teylingen Dutch counts regularly meet. The most important inhabitant of the castle was Jacoba van Beieren. Voorhout still remained a small settlement. In 1514 there were only 40 recorded houses in Voorhout. In 1657 the Leidsevaart was dug. It was a canal going from Haarlem to Leiden. Because of this Voorhout started to grow slowly. In 1842 the train track Haarlem-Leiden was opened and Voorhout got two stops, Station Piet Gijzenbrug in the hamlet of Piet Gijzenbrug near Noordwijk, and another called Station Voorhout. In 1900 Voorhout has about 2000 inhabitants. Until World war 2 the main source of income in Voorhout was from the flower bulb industry. After 1944 both train stations in Voorhout get closed for passenger transport and roads are constructed. In 1960 about 5000 people lived in Voorhout and in 1988 that number grew to 9360. The fast growth is caused by the new neighbourhood Oosthout. In 1997 Voorhout gets a train station again. Because of the construction of new neighborhoods the population grew very much.

An affluent suburb of The Hague, Wassenaar lies north of that city on the N44/A44 highway near the North Sea coast. It is part of the Haaglanden region and is part of the Rotterdam‚ÄìThe Hague metropolitan area. The municipality covers an area of , of which is covered by water. Wassenaar is home to some of the Netherlands' richest residential neighborhoods as well as the country's most expensive street, the Groot Haesebroekseweg.  History  There are rumours that the 12th-century Romanesque church in Wassenaar lies on the spot where the Northumbrian missionary Willibrord once landed in the Netherlands; the high dunes to the west were not formed until later. Wassenaar long remained an unremarkable little town, known only as the home of the House of Wassenaer. It only began to gain notoriety in the 19th century when Louis Bonaparte ordered the construction of the Heerweg (\\"Army Road\\") between The Hague and Leiden, which forms the current Rijksstraatweg. In approximately 1840, Prince Frederik had the De Paauw (Peacock) palace built, where he lived for many years; it now serves as the city hall of Wassenaar. With the construction of the railway between Rotterdam, The Hague though Wassenaar towards its final destination the coastal area of Scheveningen in 1907, the course of which now forms the Landscheidingsweg. Wassenaar became attractive as a residence for wealthy people from Rotterdam. Buildings such as the monumental Huize Ivicke were constructed. From September 1944 to March 1945 Wassenaar was one of launching sites used by the German Luftwaffe, commanded by SS General Hans Kammler for the V-2 rockets directed mainly towards London. On one of the main routes to the Wassenaarseslag, the main beach for Wassenaarders, a World War II bunker can be found. For safety reasons and the instability of the structure, it was sealed off to prevent entrance. The American World War II and Korean War general Haywood Hansell, who helped plan the Allied bombing offensive against both Germany and Japan, lived in Wassenaar in retirement from 1957 to 1966. In 1982 the Wassenaar Agreement between employers' organisations and trade unions in the Netherlands was signed here. This groundbreaking agreement helped in restraining wage growth in return for the adoption of policies to combat unemployment and inflation. The Wassenaar Arrangement, a post Cold War era arms control convention, was signed here by forty member nations in May 1996. =Modern history= Old Castle of Wassenaar De Langstraat, the main shopping street in Wassenaar Wassenaar is, as it has been since the days of Prince Frederik, an official residence: King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, his wife, Queen M√°xima of the Netherlands, and their daughters live in the villa Eikenhorst at the estate De Horsten in Wassenaar; Princess Alexia was baptized at the Romanesque church in Wassenaar. The princesses attend the Bloemcampschool in Wassenaar, founded in 1931. In addition, several ambassadorial residences are located here, including those of Canada, South Korea, Indonesia, and Ireland. In general, there is a large expatriate community of diplomats and business people in Wassenaar, largely due to its proximity to both the international organisations and embassies in The Hague as well as to several international schools located in the Hague metro area, including the American School of The Hague (ASH) located within Wassenaar. Two research institutes are also located in Wassenaar, the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study (NIAS) which provides research time, space and support for foreign and Dutch scholars, and the Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael, situated in Huys Clingendael. As a community, Wassenaar benefits from several parks and a network of bicycle paths. Trees, mainly beech, oak, and horse chestnut, are widespread, giving the town a green characteristic. The town centre supports a number of high end shops, delicatessens and bakeries as well as a cafe, bar, and restaurant. There are Football, Field Hockey, Cricket, Rugby, and Tennis clubs located in Wassenaar for locals to participate in or to enthusiastically cheer on. Some remnants of the Atlantic wall are located on Wassenaar's beach, the Wassenaarseslag; nearly a thousand metres of underground walled tunnels are present, connecting five bunkers. The network now serves as a bat sanctuary and is not open to visits anymore.vleermuisbunker.nl/ The theme park Duinrell and the race track Duindigt, the only remaining grass race track in the Netherlands, are here as well. Despite being a relatively small town, Wassenaar is well known in the Netherlands as a result of its conspicuous wealth. Areas of the town are amongst the most affluent in the Netherlands, and residents of the town have a reputation for being bekakt or posh. Wassenaar is home to some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in the nation. The Konijnen laan has an average house price of around 2.5 million Euros, making it the most expensive street in the Netherlands. The Dutch artists Ross and Iba released a song entitled 'Wassenaar,' which poked fun at the wealth of the town. Wassenaar has always enjoyed good relations with the neighbouring town of Voorschoten, with which it has shared a history from time immemorial. The House of Wassenaer, for example, historically resided in the Kasteel Duivenvoorde in Voorschoten. Recently, plans to merge into one municipality with Voorschoten have been introduced.

History 1867 map of Zoeterwoude The name Zoeterwoude is first mentioned in a document from 1205, which references a certain \\"Florentius van Sotrewold\\". It is uncertain if this is a reference to the village. The first confirmed existence is from 1276 when Dirk van Santhorst received the \\"Soetrewold\\" fiefdom from Floris V, Count of Holland. Its municipal boundaries were set circa 1300. At that time it was one of the largest municipalities in the Netherlands, but later much land was annexed by surrounding cities, notably Leiden. In 1450, the first bridge between Leiderdorp and Zoeterwoude was built. In 1574, Zoeterwoude was burnt to the ground and its polders inundated by Leideners in order to increase the range of the city's cannons. Almost no inhabitants remained in Zoeterwoude. Around 1650, Zoeterwoude had been almost rebuilt and 50 years later it was prospering. After 1800, Leiden started a long series of annexations, reducing the land area of Zoeterwoude. In 1960, the A4 motorway was built and since 1966 it has been the municipal boundary between Leiden and Zoeterwoude.

Baseball History  =Urbank Goldtimers= Established in 1903, the Urbank Goldtimers have competed at the Senior Mens' Baseball level for almost 120 years. The first known team was formed after neighboring Millerville's team experienced irreconcilable team division (history is unclear, but insider trading on goat deals is the most likely cause) and several players hitched up their oxen and carved a new field of play out of the corn in Urbank. Jebediah Urbank, founder of the city, managed for the first 20 years, and holds the managerial record for winning percentage (.882%) despite the Second Industrial Revolution's impact on other local teams' equipment development and losing many Urbank men to the Great Verndale Migration of 1907-1909. The Goldtimers are known for their utter dedication to playing baseball the right way, and an intense focus on post-game refueling strategies, sponsored by Mickey's widemouth bottles. Urban teams visiting the Urbank field are often so intimidated by the close proximity of cows to the batting cages that they skip pre-game routines altogether, only to find themselves at the mercy of the Goldtimers' offense. Urbank fans are trained in advanced cowbell tactics and act in concert to disrupt visiting teams with precision in volume and scale of cowbell usage. = Urbank Silverminers = A brief, but fierce, local baseball rivalry within the Urbank city limits flared between 1946-1950. As World War II called American soldiers to war, the Goldtimers took a leave from baseball to attend to matters overseas. With every Goldtimer volunteering for duty by 1942, and almost entirely responsible for Desert Campaign victories over Rommel in Africa, the baseball town was starved of baseball. A contingent of ballplayers sojourning west from Motley, MN arrived and established a new 35+ team - the Silverminers - in the Goldtimers' stead. Returning victorious in WWII, the Goldtimers sought to reestablish Urbank baseball dominance and challenged the Silverminers to a best of 7 series, with the field's ownership hanging in the balance. Jebediah Dorn threw four straight no-hitters to clear the Silverminers from the city limits and erased the Silverminers from the local baseball scene forever.

History Thief River Falls takes its name from a geographic feature, the falls of the Red Lake River at its confluence with the Thief River. The name of the river is a loose translation of the Ojibwe phrase Gimood-akiwi ziibi, literally, the \\"Stolen-land river\\" or \\"Thieving-land river\\", which originated when a band of Dakota Indians occupied a secret encampment along the river, hence \\"stealing\\" the land, before being discovered and routed by the neighboring Ojibwe.William W. Warren, History of the Ojibway People, ch. 5. In the Treaty of Old Crossing of 1863, the Moose Dung's Indian Reservation was established on the west bank of the Thief River, at its confluence with Red Lake River.

The eponymous town site was established in 1887 and later incorporated as a city in 1896. Thief River Falls first developed as a lumber-milling town. It is located in a major agriculture area because of the rich soil left by ancient Glacial Lake Agassiz.

The proximity to forests and shipping made Thief River Falls ideal for logging. In the late 19th century the Great Northern Railway was built, and in 1904, the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway (‚ÄúSoo Line‚Äù) passed through on its route from Saint Paul to Winnipeg. Branches were later built to Drake, North Dakota and Duluth, Minnesota. The Minnesota Northwestern Electric Railway, an electric powered passenger train, ran from Thief River Falls to Goodridge between 1914 and 1940. Today, the river and rails still power the local economy with tourism and shipping. Canadian Pacific Railway and Minnesota Northern Railroad now occupy tracks through town. To this day, Soo Line engine 1024 rests outside city hall (formerly the Soo Line Depot). On Tuesday, August 21, 2007, the Empress Express (Canadian Pacific 2816) spent the night in front of the historic Soo Line depot in Thief River Falls. Thief River Falls Radio reported that the classic steam engine was built in 1930, and the 45 ticketed passengers were to leave for Glenwood, Minnesota on Wednesday morning. =Major industries= Snowmobiles Arctic Cat, Inc. can trace its roots to former Polaris Industries founder Edgar Hetteen who left Polaris in 1960 and started Polar Manufacturing in Thief River Falls. Shortly after changing name to Arctic Enterprises, the new company produced snowmobiles. Arctic Cat purchased several boat manufacturers including Spirit Marine which produced the first Wetbike in 1978. A few snowless winters in the early 1980s bankrupted the 20-year-old company, which closed their facilities by 1982. In 1984, Arctic Cat was reborn under a new company name, Arctco, which was changed to Arctic Cat in 1996. Electronics distribution Digi-Key Electronics is one of the largest electronics distributors in North America. It employs over 4,000 employees. The company started in 1972 with Dr. Ronald A. Stordahl's interest in ham radio, which led him to assemble and sell digital electronic keyer kits to other ham radio operators for sending radiotelegraph messages. This device was called the Digi-Key.Digi-Key History As a testament to how Digi-Key has distributed parts literally \\"around the world,\\" electronic components it sold are inside satellites now orbiting the Earth.

Product Development and Marketing. Retrieved 27 June 2020. Tractors Steiger Tractors were invented by Douglas and Maurice Steiger from Thief River Falls during the 1950s. The brothers built their first tractor the winter of 1957-58 after seeing a need to cover their ground more efficiently. After designing and building the tractors on their farm for six years, the brothers opened a production facility in Fargo, North Dakota. A new plant built in 1974 could produce a new tractor every 18 minutes. Steiger produced many models of tractor with the main feature being the horsepower. Ford chose Steiger to manufacture the Ford tractors of the late 1970s and early 80s. As the farm economy slumped in the late 80s, Steiger had trouble selling tractors. Steiger filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986, and was soon after sold to Tenneco, parent company of J. I. Case. Case IH continued to produce and sell Steiger tractors while introducing its own lines of 4wd tractors. Case still produces Steiger tractors out of the Fargo, North Dakota facility.Steiger Tractor history and models Education Thief River Falls is home to Thief River Falls Public Schools, a public school district operating a high school (Lincoln High School), middle school (Franklin Middle School), and elementary school (Challenger Elementary School).

The Wall Street Journal called it \\"an old fashioned gay love story - one where love is upstaged by shame, secrecy and social defiance.\\" It is the story of Gil and Ray, who at age 17 were secret lovers in what one reviewer called \\"a small homophobic Minnesota town in the '40s\\"‚Äîpresumably Thief River Falls. The plot portrays a love between these two men that spans 53 years. As stated by another reviewer, \\"The play attempted to show what it would be like to be a gay man in a small town in the late '40s, when two men kissing would have been a revolutionary act.\\"Richard Connema, \\"The West Coast Premier of Lee Blessing's, Thief River\\", San Francisco Chronicle, 2002 The play most recently ran in Chicago in early 2007, where it was called \\"the definitive work capturing the homosexual experience in the rural American Midwest over the last 50 years.\\".Rick R. Reed, Theater: The Other Side of the ‚ÄòRiver‚Äô, Windy City Times, Feb. 28, 2007) The specific Minnesota connection of the play is unstated, but playwright Blessing grew up in the Twin Cities area and attended Minnetonka High School before leaving for Reed College in Oregon in the late 1960s.

The population was 364 at the 2010 census. Minnesota State Highway 23 serves as a main route in the community, and Interstate 35 is nearby. History The location of the village was originally within the lands of the village of Partridge, at a stop far outside the original village along Great Northern Railway; here a post office was set up, first called Partridge from 1889‚Äì1909, before changing its name to Askov in 1909. Most of the original village of Partridge was destroyed in the 1894 Hinckley fire. The immigrants to the Danish 'colony' of Askov were nationalistic Lutheran followers of the theologian and cultural leader, Bishop N. F. S. Grundtvig, romanticising the superiority of Danish culture and emphasising the importance of speech and education (a motto was \\"enlightenment must be our delight). Danish immigrants had up till this point been mostly economic migrants fleeing poverty in Denmark, but the first migrants to Askov were almost all Grundvigian Danes from elsewhere in the USA.https://www.danishmuseum.org/explore/danish-american- culture/immigrationhttp://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/8/v08i04p363-385.pdf The Dansk Folkesamfund (Danish Peoples Society) was founded in 1887 by Svend Hersleb Grundtvig, the son of N. F. S. Grundtvig, to conserve Danish social heritage and promote immigration to the USA. The Dansk Folkesamfund, with help from the railroad company, bought the parcels of land around the train station and post office in 1906 and by 1909 had sold the 45 plots exclusively to Danish settlers, some 25 families.http://www.lakesnwoods.com/Askov.htm The name \\"Askov\\" was chosen to commemorate the larger village of Askov in Denmark which is the site of one of the largest folk high schools (Askov H√∏jskole) founded by N. F. S. Grundtvig,http://www.askovrutabagafestival.com/index.html although it is claimed the name is derived from 'ash wood' (ask holt in Danish). By 1916 almost a thousand settlers of Danish descent lived here, although 1920 USA census data records only 242 inhabitants in Askov and most people lived in the village of Partridge -this was thus the largest concentration of Danish settlers in Minnesota. The new village was incorporated on April 25, 1918, and officially separated from the township as the City of Askov on April 8, 1921. Initially the main economic activity was dairy (the first cooperative creamery being built in 1910) supplemented by mixed intensive farming. Nearly all the streets in Askov have been given Danish names.http://askovrutabagafestival.com/blog-and-news/the-signsthey-are- a-changing-new-signs-in-askov Despite the Danish history, the modern population has the following ancestries: German (20.8%), Irish (12.0%), Norwegian (7.3%), Danish (6.3%), Scandinavian (5.2%), American (4.7%).http://www.city-data.com/city/Askov-Minnesota.html The fashion brand Askov Finlayson was named after this city and neighboring Finlayson, Minnesota, which share a freeway exit on I-35.http://www.mr-mag.com/askov- finlayson-the-trifecta/  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

Osborn, a former Superintendent at the school. The school hosts grades K-6 and provides preschool a few days a week. The class sizes are relatively small with all classes under 20 students enrolled making the whole school size around 80 for 7 grades. Due to budget cuts, the teacher to student ratio is approximately 1/14. In 2006, the classes were combined providing one teacher to teach two grades. First and Second, Third and Fourth, and Fifth and Sixth were placed together in one room to be taught by one teacher. =High School= The former Finlayson High School was torn down in 2004 due to instability. The last class to graduate was the class of 1987. Students who attend high school in Finlayson were moved to Hinckley High School to finish their education. The Finlayson high school's colors were maroon and gold and the mascot was a Falcon. Later, the high school in Hinckley changed its name to Hinckley-Finlayson High School. Hinckley changed its mascot from the Vulcans (Red and Silver), to the Jaguars (Red, Black and Silver) during this switch. To this day, the students of Finlayson make the 30 minute commute to Hinckley for high school. The average class grade is between 50-80 students with around 400 students total.

They trapped and hunted on the land and traded furs at the Mille Lacs and Pokegama trading posts. When European settlers came to the Hinckley area, it was a heavily forested area with thick forests of white pine, some of the largest in the state. The first railroad arrived in Hinckley in 1869; and so began a logging and railroad expansion. Hinckley was founded as the Village of Central Station in 1885, the village was re-incorporated as the City of Hinckley in 1907. Both names were after Hinckley Township where the city is located within. Surrounding Hinckley Township was known as Central Station by the railroads because of its position halfway between the Twin Ports of Duluth and Superior as well as the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Hinckley Township was named in 1870 after Isaac Hinckley, president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. By 1894, Hinckley was a prosperous community that had everything needed to serve residents and the fast-expanding lumber industry. On September 1, 1894, everything changed with a firestorm wiping out Hinckley and many northeastern Minnesota towns. Today the Hinckley Fire Museum, nine blocks west of Interstate 35 in downtown Hinckley, tells the devastating story of what came to be called the Great Hinckley Fire and the town's recovery from it. The museum is located in a restored railroad depot downtown, an exact replica of the pre-fire depot, built just after the fire. After the fire, the burned stumps of the forests were cleared to take advantage of the now nutrient-rich soil. Hinckley's recovery would hinge on agriculture. Some of the main crops were potatoes, fruits and vegetables. The early harvests were bountiful. Abundant clover helped feed milk cows for a brisk dairy industry. Following the national trend in farming , Hinckley has lost most of its agricultural underpinnings. The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe opened Grand Casino Hinckley in 1992.

It is a part of the municipality of Westland, and lies about 10 km south-west of The Hague. The village of Monster has a population of around 11,580.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Statline: Kerncijfers wijken en buurten 2003-2005. As of 1 January 2005. The statistical area Monster, which also can include the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 14,540. Until 2004 it was a separate municipality and covered an area of 20.15 km¬≤ (of which 5.70 km¬≤ is water). The former municipality of Monster also included the towns, Poeldijk and Ter Heijde. Monster and Ter Heijde are towns on the North Sea coast and have a popular beach. History In the 13th century a great deal of the Westland, Loosduinen and The Hague were administered by Monster. When The Hague came to be constructed, a split was made in Haag-ambacht and Half-Loosduinen. The latter village was separated from Monster in 1812. Remains of the former glory can still be seen between The Hague and Monster at such estates as Ockenburgh, Bloemendaal, Solleveld and Langeveld. There is a great deal of uncertainty over the origin of the name \\"Monster\\". It is probably derived from the Latin monasterium, meaning monastery. The name was also used for the ground that belonged to a monastery. Another explanation was that Monster was derived from the old-Dutch word monster, which meant amongst others \\"big church\\" (from Latin: monstrum), which is supported by the fact that Monster had those days one of the largest churches in the area. Monster was previously a destination for pilgrimage, because Machutus parish possessed some relics of its patron Machutus, who is also known as Machuut. People came to be healed of the \\"falling sickness\\", which was possibly epilepsy.

The population was 229 at the 2010 census. Pine County 61 serves as a main route in the community. The Willard Munger Bicycle / Snowmobile Trail also passes through Rutledge. History Long before it ever became an incorporated village, a group of Native Indians lived along the banks of the Kettle River from where the community is today to a point about five miles downstream. The Government Road, a.k.a. Military Road, between St. Paul, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin passed through that area in the 1860s. A bridge was constructed across the Kettle River at what was called the Rock Dam. On the south side of the river, a station was built, at which stagecoaches stopped to change horses and allow passengers to get out and stretch their legs and have a lunch. It was at this location where the first Europeans settled. In 1870, the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad was completed in this region. A depot was built about two and one half miles upstream from the Rock Dam, named Kettle River Station. The community began to grow near the railroad station. On February 14, 1893, an election was held at the school house to decide whether the settlement should be incorporated as a village. A total of 22 votes were cast, 19 favoring incorporation. The Village of Rutledge was named after local lumberman Edward Rutledge, who had built several mills in the area. James D. McCormack served as the first Mayor of Rutledge.

The population was 415 at the 2010 census. Interstate 35, County Road 43, and County 61 (Cross Street) are three of the main routes in the community.  History  The first known settlement in what was to become the Village of Willow River, at the junctions of the Willow and Kettle Rivers, was an encampment of Ojibway Indians. In July 1850 a roadway connecting the upper Mississippi River and the Lake Superior country, named the Point Douglas to St. Louis River Road, and more commonly known as the government military road, went from just south of St. Paul to Duluth. Willow River was chosen as a changing station for the coach horses. In 1861 the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad was organized with the financial help of Jay Cooke. It wasn't until August 1879 that the completed line from St. Paul to Duluth was opened. It was the railroad that helped settle and promote living in the northern part of Minnesota. The railroad also promoted the lumber industry. Many towns and villages, including Willow River, were organized once a lumber company set up shop. In March 1874 the Kettle River Township was organized and Willow River at this time consisted of a railroad depot, water tank, wood yard, and two section houses built for the railroad hands. Pine County records show that the three sections of land that would eventually make up the village of Willow River were homesteaded by Edward Clough, Albert Kinney, Peter Jarvis, Joseph Nebula, and Richard Abbott. In 1886 Abbott sold his section of land to the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company. In 1888 Jarvis sold his section to Fox-Wisdom. In the spring of 1890, Warren D. Fox and John Wisdom opened the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company in Willow River. The company then platted the land to build their business and offer lots for employees. By 1895 Kinney had leased his land to Fox-Wisdom, and Clough had sold all but 80 acres of his section in the northern part of the village. Joseph Nebula's section was past the lake and likely unusable to the company. The Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company sawmill was constructed and opened in March 1890. It was located on the south side of the present day Willow River dam. To ease the flow of logs, dams were built along the river to store water. There were as least three built and maintained by Fox-Wisdom. They were known as the \\"Mile and a Half,\\" the \\"Willow Lake,\\" and the \\"Oak Lake\\" dams. Sawmill operations began in the early spring and continued until the freeze-up of the mill pond. The mill produced lumber, lath, and shingles employing about 125 men. The mill cut 125,000 feet of lumber per day during their peak season. Many who worked in the logging camps during the winter came to the mill to work in the spring. On May 8, 1891, the village plat was filed in Pine County. The Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company and its employees made up the majority of property owners. Willow River, like many other villages in northern Minnesota, owed its existence to the lumber industry. In November 1891, Willow River was incorporated as a village by a vote of 37 to 18 in the upstairs hall of the Fox-Wisdom Company store.WILLOW RIVER: Flowing Through the Century written by Coral Popowitz, 1991, published by Kanabec Publications-Mora, Minnesota Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Geography Badger Township is located at the eastern edge of the Red River Valley. The township is located entirely within the drainage of the Clearwater River and its tributaries, which in turn flow into the Red Lake River, the Red River of the North, and on to Hudson Bay. Most of the township is part of the glacial moraine that formed the southeast shore of prehistoric Lake Agassiz. According to the United States Census Bureau, Badger Township has a total area of , of which of it is land and of it (1.33%) is water.

The population then dipped to 391 in 1910, rose back to 447 in 1920, and fell back to 350 in 1930. The population has been in decline ever since. =Current demographics (2000 Census)= As of the census of 2000, there were 166 people, 46 households, and 31 families residing in the township. The population density was 4.7 people per square mile (1.8/km2). There were 57 housing units at an average density of 1.6/sq mi (0.6/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 95.78% White, 3.01% Native American, and 1.20% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.01% of the population. There were 46 households, out of which 32.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.5% were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.6% were non- families. 30.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The median income for a household in the township was $25,625, and the median income for a family was $33,750. Males had a median income of $26,875 versus $25,417 for females. The per capita income for the township was $16,999. About 6.7% of families and 8.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under the age of eighteen and 6.1% of those 65 or over. =Early demographics (1900 Census)= As of the census of 1900, Badger Township had 448 people in 91 households, a density of 12.44 people per square mile, more than 2¬Ω times as many people as in 2000. The population in 1900 was overwhelmingly Norwegian, with 72 heads of households (79.12%) having been born in Norway, 6 (6.59%) born in Sweden, 4 (4.40%) born in Wisconsin, 3 (3.30%) born in Denmark, 2 (2.20%) born in Minnesota, and 1 (1.10%) in each of Michigan, Illinois and Canada. One hundred percent (100%) of the population in 1900 was reported as white. One family consisting of four individuals (4.40% of the township population) had a French surname (Dion) and another family from Wisconsin had a likely Yankee surname (Gundy). Other than these, every surname of residents in the township was obviously of Scandinavian origin. Of all residents in the township in 1900, 84 (17.21%) were born in the United States, and 404 (82.79%) were of foreign birth. Not a single resident of Badger Township in 1900 who had been born in the United States was born in a state other than Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, North Dakota or Wisconsin. The vast majority of these were born in Minnesota, most of them children. A surprising number of those born in the United States but not in Minnesota (11, or 2.25% of the total population) were born in North Dakota, indicating that at least some of the families in Badger Township had initially traveled further west before settling (at least temporarily) in Minnesota. The rest had migrated directly from Scandinavia or from the immediately adjoining states in the Upper Midwest. No persons of Native American descent were listed in the Census of 1900, nor were there any persons of Hispanic descent, Asian or Pacific Islander descent, or Black, Negro or African American descent. In 1900, the Census focused more upon ethnicity as defined by country of origin rather than racial background, but it is noteworthy that no residents of Badger Township in the Census of 1900 were of German, English, Slavic, Italian or Southern European descent. History =European occupancy and settlement= Pre-European contact There were no permanent settlements in Badger Township prior to European settlement. The territory was traversed by occasional Ojibwe and Dakota hunting expeditions and may have been a seasonal food-gathering area for Ojibwe families, but was otherwise unpeopled until the mid-19th century. Indian artifacts, including grinding rocks, were excavated near Badger Creek in the SW 1/4 of Section 8 in the mid-1960s, indicating a periodic visitation pattern but no permanent residency. Bison roamed over Badger Township into the 1870s, and were actively pursued by Indians and Metis from the Pembina Settlements. Several bison skulls and skeletal remains thought to be over 2000 years old, as well as an Indian grinding rock, were unearthed in a peat bog by the Nikolayson family in Section 33 in the 1960s, and now are on display in the University of Minnesota in nearby Crookston.A. Bailey, Erskine, Minn., Man Gives University of Minnesota Crookston Ancient Bison Skull for Display, Grand Forks Herald (Wednesday, February 28, 2007) Native land cessions and incorporation into United States territory Badger Township is not connected with any verifiable native or European historic events or circumstances until transfer in the Treaty of Old Crossing (1863) and the Treaty of Old Crossing (1864), which included extensive other areas and involved no physical acts within the township. Prior to that time, the territory now included in Badger Township was within the watershed of the Red River Valley and hence technically a part of Rupert's Land and Assiniboia before becoming part of British Canada as a result of the boundary settlement in the Treaty of 1818, a which fixed the international border at the 49th parallel north from the Northwest Angle of Lake of the Woods westward to the Rocky Mountains. Red River Trail The easternmost Red River Trail between Pembina, North Dakota and St. Paul, Minnesota crossed the Red Lake River at Huot, Minnesota (the site of the Treaty of Old Crossing (1863)), which is a few miles northwest of Badger Township in what is now Red Lake County, Minnesota. The trail skirted the western edges of adjoining Grove Park-Tilden Township, Minnesota and Knute Township, Minnesota but is not generally considered to have crossed into the territory of Badger Township. (Since Red River ox cart trains used in trading expeditions between Pembina and St. Paul, Minnesota included many family members and hunters in addition to the oxcart drivers, they tended to spread out across the prairie except at key fords and crossings. It is likely that people in the trains entered what is now Badger Township many times before the extension of the railroad to Fargo, North Dakota put the Red River ox carts out of business in the early 1860s. Thereafter, while there is no specific record of its occupation prior to 1880, the history of the township is essentially indistinguishable from areas to the west, north and east in Northwest Minnesota). Initial Euro- American settlement Badger Township was traversed by trappers and traders, including Indians, M√©tis and other half-breed people as well as white men incidental to the fur trade between 1790 and 1870. In 1797, the North West Company established a fur trading post approximately 15 miles northwest of Badger Township at the confluence of the Red Lake River and the Clearwater River, near the current site of Red Lake Falls. The American Fur Company, the Hudson's Bay Company and several other fur trading companies had active trapping and trading operations throughout the Red River Valley and Red Lake region prior to 1858. After Minnesota statehood, although the area remained unsurveyed and closed to settlement, some squatters may have encroached into the territory of Badger Township as permanent settlers before 1880. The township was not opened for settlement until 1883, when as part of the \\"Thirteen Towns\\" of eastern Polk County it was finally surveyed as a township and made available for homestead under the Homestead Act. Most of the township was initially settled by Norwegian immigrants in the late 1880s. The subsequent history of Badger Township is virtually indistinguishable from that of most of Northern Minnesota. Virtually all of the land was homesteaded or sold as railroad land to farmers. =Current land use and occupancy= Badger Township is essentially agricultural in character, although a large percentage of it is of marginal quality with thin, sandy soils or swampland and potholed, essentially abandoned or unused for any cropland or pasturage purpose. As a result, much of the land is now included in wildlife management areas, including Kakaik State Wildlife Management Area, Erskine State Wildlife Management Area, and Polk State Wildlife Management Area, and much of the remainder of the township has been enrolled as CRP land. Business Until recently, no active business enterprises were operating in Badger Township, excepting farming operations which are mostly family owned. A general store and railroad depot were in operation in Cisco until the late 1940s, and a few other home-operated family businesses may have had a fleeting existence, but none have endured. For example, the C.C. Spray Service operated between 1964 and 1966, providing Carbola whitewashing services to Grade A dairy farms throughout Northwestern Minnesota and Northeastern North Dakota. A large grain terminal, including a mile-long circular siding capable of holding a 110-car freight train, is now operating in Section 32 of Badger Township on the east side of along County Road 18, south of Highway 2 and the Great Northern Railway (BNSF). This facility, known as the Erskine Grain Terminal, was developed in 2006‚Äì2007 by the grain co-ops of Oklee, Newfolden and Winger to allow area growers to assemble trainloads of grain for direct shipment to market in order to meet current freight pricing policies of the railroads.Cover Story, Getting the Grain on the Train, Ag Week, Sept. 28, 2009 http://www.agweek.com/articles/?id=6394&article;_id=15129&property;_id=41 Community organizations There is no incorporated or unincorporated community of any size within Badger Township, although the former places known as Sletten and Cisco were located within its territory. The nearest towns are Erskine, Mentor and Brooks, all located outside the township. There are no stoplights and no paved roads (other than a state highway and a US highway which pass through the township's eastern and southern fringes). The township is managed by a town board which mainly provides for road grading. The only public building in the township is a town hall on the north side of Section 21. There are no school buildings although at one time there were several; the township now is served by Win-E-Mac School District, near Erskine. There is one historically active church (Saron Lutheran Church) and one new church (the brand new Old Believers Church on the southwest quarter of Section 17, built in 2003), within the township, and there are four cemeteries (one at Saron Lutheran Church, another on Section 32 known as the Broderheim cemetery, a third at the northeast corner of Section 17 known as Sorum Cemetery, and the fourth and newest just established on the southwest quarter of Section 17 by the Old Believers Church).

It is the county seat of Polk County. The population was 7,891 at the 2010 census. It is part of the \\"Grand Forks, ND-MN Metropolitan Statistical Area\\" or \\"Greater Grand Forks\\". Crookston is the episcopal seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Crookston. Crookston is partially a commuter town to the larger city of Grand Forks, North Dakota. History =Early history= The Crookston area was virtually unoccupied until European contact and remained little more than a hunting ground associated with the Pembina settlements until the 1860s. The land in Crookston's immediate vicinity is not connected with any verifiable Native American or European historic events or circumstances until transfer in the Treaties of Old Crossing in 1863‚Äì64. Before that, the territory now included in Crookston was part of Rupert's Land and Assiniboia before becoming part of the United States as a result of the boundary settlement in the Treaty of 1818. The Crookston area was traversed by trappers and traders, including Ojibwa and Lakota Indians, M√©tis, and other mixed-race people as well as white men between 1790 and 1870. A branch of the Red River Trails passed nearby; it was used by fur traders between the 1840s and 1870s. =Settlement= The present-day site of Crookston first saw settlement by non-Indian people around 1872. It was the site of a federal land office by 1876 and sited on a portion of the Great Northern Railway that began operation by 1880. The town was incorporated on April 1, 1879 as \\"Queen City\\". By the end of that year, the town had a jail, graded streets, and a few plank sidewalks. Soon it was decided that the town needed a new name. Two factions emerged supporting two different names. One wished to honor the town's first mayor, Captain Ellerey C. Davis, with the name Davis. Another group picked the name Crookston to honor Colonel William Crooks, a soldier and railroad builder. The name was reportedly chosen by coin toss. Soon Scandinavian and German immigrants began populating Crookston. At one point, eight different railroad lines reached the town, and it became a center of commerce and manufacturing. Geography Crookston sits in the fertile Red River Valley, once a part of glacial Lake Agassiz. As Lake Agassiz receded, it left behind rich mineral deposits. This made the area around Crookston prime for agricultural uses. Grains such as wheat and other crops, including sugar beets and potatoes grow well in the area around Crookston. Crookston has a relatively flat landscape. The Red Lake River flows through the city and makes several twists and turns (oxbows). The riverbank has eroded somewhat. U.S. Highway 2, U.S. Highway 75, Minnesota Highway 102, and Minnesota Highway 9 are four of the main routes in the community. Crookston is the northern terminus of the Agassiz Recreational Trail, a 53-mile multi-use trail built on an abandoned railroad grade that has its southern terminus at Ulen. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Demographics Crookston has not seen major population growth since the 1970s.

The population was 8,601 at the 2010 Census, making it the largest community in Polk County. It is located in the Red River Valley region along the eastern bank of the Red River of the North, directly across from the larger city of Grand Forks, North Dakota. The cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks form the center of the Grand Forks, ND‚ÄìMN Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is often called Greater Grand Forks. The metropolitan area had an estimated population of 102,299 on July 1, 2018. History A post office called East Grand Forks has been in operation since 1883. The city was named for its location east of Grand Forks, North Dakota. East Grand Forks was incorporated in 1887. =Flood of 1997= A residential neighborhood in East Grand Forks flooded in late April 1997 East Grand Forks, along with Grand Forks, was heavily damaged by a major flood in 1997. The entire city was under a mandatory evacuation and almost no homes were spared damage. After the flood, several neighborhoods had to be demolished because of damage. The city cleared development from the floodplain bordering the Red and Red Lake rivers. It developed a large park known as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway to provide a new recreation area for residents along the river. A similar park was developed in Grand Forks, North Dakota on the opposite side of the river. The parklands, with trees and a variety of greenery, can absorb floodwaters and help protect the cities naturally. Moving residential and business development out of these areas also helps prevent future flood damage. In addition, a new system of dikes was constructed to protect the city from future flooding. The city has rebuilt. New businesses attracted to the downtown include a Cabela's sporting goods store and movie theater complex. Geography The confluence of the Red and Red Lake RiversEast Grand Forks is located in the flat, fertile Red River Valley, formed by the ancient glacial Lake Agassiz.

Culture Downtown Erskine, c. 1910 Downtown Erskine, c. 1910 Erskine's town festival is known as the Erskine Water Carnival, and held in early June. The Erskine Fish, the concrete statue that is the world's largest Northern Pike and the town's principal tourist attraction, is on a lawn in a small park on the shore of Cameron Lake, just down the street from downtown Erskine. In addition, it is the center of a community of Russian Old Believers estimated at between 50 and 100 families. The Old Believers began moving to Erskine around 1998 in order to escape a farming crisis and suburban sprawl that threatened their community near Woodburn, Oregon. Parks, recreation and public facilities The Rydell National Wildlife Refuge is along County Road 238 approximately west of Erskine and 2¬Ω miles south of U.S. Highway 2. The Oak Lake Golf Course is just east of town at the intersection of Highway 2 and U.S. Highway 59. The best local resort and fishing areas are Maple Lake, a lake near Mentor, and Maple Bay, as well as Union Lake and Lake Sarah, a few miles south of Erskine. Like many other lakes in other towns, Erskine's sewage was dumped into Cameron Lake until the Clean Water Act of 1970 forced the town to redirect its sewage to the new sewer plant near Badger Lake. Former residents and old-timers recall that the shores of Cameron Lake were littered with dead fish in the old days. Today the lake is much cleaner, and with the rising costs of lakeshore property in the area, there is an increase in development on the lakeshore. Schools Erskine is served by a consolidated multi-community K‚Äì12 school district known as \\"Win-E-Mac\\" (which represents McIntosh, Minnesota, and Winger, Minnesota, in addition to Erskine). A vocational and technical college is in Thief River Falls. The nearest four-year colleges in the vicinity include a branch campus of the University of Minnesota in Crookston and Bemidji State University in Bemidji, in addition to the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks and North Dakota State University in Fargo. Media =Telephone and internet service= The oldest telephone cooperative in the state, Garden Valley Telephone Company, is headquartered in Erskine and serves most of northwestern Minnesota. It was formed to provide telephone coverage to the region at a time when it was difficult to get telephone service to the area. Garden Valley Telephone Company now provides internet service, although other ISPs also serve the area. The Erskine telephone prefix is 687, formerly Murray 7, and the area code is 218. =Newspapers= Erskine is home to the Erskine Echo, a weekly newspaper that began publishing before 1900. Other weekly papers include the McIntosh Times and The 13 Towns (published in Fosston for the 13 townships of eastern Polk County). Area daily papers include the Crookston Times (Crookston), Grand Forks Herald (Grand Forks, North Dakota), The Forum (Fargo, North Dakota), The Bemidji Pioneer (Bemidji), and the Star Tribune (Minneapolis), available by subscription and in vendor boxes. =Radio and television= Erskine has no radio or television stations, but nearby Fosston is home to three radio stations. Other radio and television stations from Bemidji, Crookston, Thief River Falls, Grand Forks, Fargo, and Winnipeg can be picked up in Erskine. Transportation =Roads and highways= Erskine is just west of the intersection of U.S. Highway 59 and four-lane U.S. Highway 2, and approximately east of Interstate Highway 29 at Grand Forks, N.D., and north of Interstate Highway 94 at Fergus Falls. =Air transport= The nearest airports with commercial service are Bemidji ( east), Thief River Falls ( north) and Grand Forks ( west). An uninstrumented grass airfield known as the Erskine Airport was in operation from 1954 until the early 1970s, but no longer exists. Nearby Fosston ( east) and Crookston ( west) both have private aviation airfields. =Rail transport= At the historic junction of the Great Northern Railway and the Soo Line Railroad, Erskine used to appear prominently on many national railroad maps and atlases that omitted much larger cities and towns in the vicinity. Both lines are still in place today, with the Great Northern tracks now owned by the BNSF Railway and the Soo Line tracks by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Erskine's freight depot, while still standing, is closed for business, and rail passenger service was discontinued many years ago. =Bus services= Greyhound Bus Lines no longer serves Erskine, but Jefferson Lines has taken over the Fargo-Minneapolis route it previously served. The Tri-Valley Heartland Express Bus provides scheduled weekly or biweekly service to Crookston, Bemidji, Thief River Falls and other destinations for seniors and others on an advance reservation basis. Business and manufacturing =Historic businesses= Prior to 1980, Erskine's primary function was as a service community for the local agricultural community. In the early 1900s, the town boasted four grain elevators, an ice plant, a lumber mill and several blacksmith shops. Even as late as 1980, the town businesses included a grain elevator, a creamery, a lumber yard, a fuel delivery service, and several farm implement dealers, junkyards and repair shops. As family farming in the area declined, the agricultural services component has diminished as larger growers took their supply and services business to larger communities. =Erskine Manufacturing aka Erskine Attachments= Erskine was once the home of Erskine Attachments, formerly known as Erskine Manufacturing Company, established in 1948. The company began as a manufacturer of heavy equipment snowblowers and grain hitch elevators before changing its name to Erskine Attachments when it began manufacturing a line of Skid Steer Attachments for the Ingersoll Rand Bobcat company. Now private, Erskine Attachments manufactures more than 40 skid steer attachments including brush mowers, snowblowers, blades, buckets, grapples, post drivers, stump grinders, tree shears, and others that fit all skid steers and some front end loaders that utilize the skid steer style quick attach mechanism. Erskine Attachments was used as a pilot for the Minnesota JOBZ incentive program to revitalize Minnesota's manufacturing opportunities and has been referenced for its continuance as a viable success story. Erskine Attachments is now located just outside of Fosston, MN. =Other businesses= Other significant employers include Garden Valley Telephone Company and the Pioneer Memorial Care Center, a nursing home and retirement community. In 2008, Crookston-based Agassiz Energy, LLC, announced that it had postponed indefinitely its plans for a $58.5 million ethanol plant at the junction of the former Great Northern and Soo Line railroads, near the interchange of U.S. Routes 59 and 2. * References External links * City of Erskine Official Website * Click here and Page Down to \\"Elena's Place\\" for an Interview with an Erskine Old Believer * A 1999 Article Explaining How and Why the Old Believers moved to Erskine * Win-E-Mac School District website Category:Cities in Minnesota Category:Cities in Polk County, Minnesota Category:Old Believer communities in the United States Category:Russian communities in the United States Category:Russian-American culture in Minnesota ","title":"Erskine, Minnesota"},{"id":"121352","text":"Esther Township is a township in Polk County, Minnesota, United States.

Christopher Columbus first landed in what is called today \\"Luperon\\" a small town on the north coast of the Dominican Republic side of Hispa√±ola Island. The name of Hipa√±ola was given to the island to honor the queen Isabel of Spain. Christopher Columbus was an Italian-Genoa explorer on behalf of Spain, who set sail from \\"Puerto de Palos, Spain to across the Atlantic Ocean in search of a faster route to the Far East only to land at the New World. His first voyage to the New World on the Spanish ships Santa Mar√≠a, Ni√±a, and La Pinta took approximately three months. Columbus and his crew's arrival to the New World initiated the Columbian Exchange which introduced the transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, and technology between the New World and the Old World. The landing is celebrated as Columbus Day in the United States, but the name varies on the international spectrum. The Dominican Republic, the epicenter of this great historical event, and where Christopher Columbus first set foot, celebrate this day as \\"The Discovery Of the Americas\\". In some Latin American countries, October 12 is known as D√≠a de la Raza or (Day of the Race). This is the case for Mexico, which inspired Jose Vasconcelos's book celebrating the Day of the Iberoamerican Race. Some countries such as Spain refer the holiday as D√≠a de la Hispanidad and Fiesta Nacional de Espa√±a where it is also the religious festivity of la Virgen del Pilar. Since 2009, Peru has celebrated D√≠a de los pueblos originarios y el di√°logo intercultural (Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Dialogue Day). Belize and Uruguay celebrate it as D√≠a de las Am√©ricas (Day of the Americas). Giornata Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo or Festa Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo is the formal name of Italy's celebration as well as in Little Italys around the world.  United States observance  = History = Stylized graphic from the United States Department of Defense Celebration of Christopher Columbus' voyage in the early United States is recorded from as early as 1792. In that year, the Tammany Society in New York City (for whom it became an annual tradition) and the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston celebrated the 300th anniversary of Columbus' landing in the New World. For the 400th anniversary in 1892, following a lynching in New Orleans where a mob had murdered 11 Italian immigrants, President Benjamin Harrison declared Columbus Day as a one-time national celebration. The proclamation was part of a wider effort after the lynching incident to placate Italian Americans and ease diplomatic tensions with Italy. During the anniversary in 1892, teachers, preachers, poets and politicians used rituals to teach ideals of patriotism. These rituals took themes such as citizenship boundaries, the importance of loyalty to the nation, and the celebration of social progress, included among them was the Pledge of Allegiance by Francis Bellamy.Kubal, Timothy. 2008. Cultural Movements and Collective Memory: Christopher Columbus and the Rewriting of the National Origin Myth. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. Many Italian-Americans observe Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage, and the first such celebration had already been held in New York City on October 12, 1866. The day was first enshrined as a legal holiday in the United States through the lobbying of Angelo Noce, a first generation Italian, in Denver. The first statewide holiday was proclaimed by Colorado governor Jesse F. McDonald in 1905, and it was made a statutory holiday in 1907.Sale, Kirkpatrick, \\"The Conquest of Paradise\\", p. 359, In 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus and New York City Italian leader Generoso Pope, Congress passed a statute stating: \\"The President is requested to issue each year a proclamation (1) designating October 12 as Columbus Day; (2) calling on United States Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Columbus Day; and (3) inviting the people of the United States to observe Columbus Day, in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies that express the public sentiment befitting the anniversary of the discovery of America.\\" President Franklin Delano Roosevelt responded by making such a proclamation. This proclamation did not lead to the modern federal holiday. It was similar to language regarding Thomas Jefferson's Birthday and Gold Star Mothers Day. In 1966, Mariano A. Lucca, from Buffalo, NY, founded the National Columbus Day Committee, which lobbied to make Columbus Day a federal holiday. These efforts were successful and Columbus Day became a federal holiday in 1968. Since 1971 (Oct. 11), the holiday has been attributed to the second Monday in October, The bill in question became the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. coincidentally exactly the same day as Thanksgiving in neighboring Canada since 1957. It is generally observed nowadays by banks, the bond market, the U.S. Postal Service, other federal agencies, most state government offices, many businesses, and most school districts. Some businesses and some stock exchanges remain open, and some states and municipalities abstain from observing the holiday. The traditional date of the holiday also adjoins the anniversary of the United States Navy (founded October 13, 1775), and thus both occasions are customarily observed by the Navy and the Marine Corps with either a 72- or 96-hour liberty period. On October 10, 1992, Pope John Paul II visited the Dominican Republic to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the Discovery Of the Americas and the arrival of Christianity in theHitoria de las America, Enciclopedia Dominicana, The New York Times \\"New World\\" His visit ended with a mass in the nation's cathedral. The first cathedral in the Western Hemisphere = Local observance of Columbus Day = Columbus Day in Salem, Massachusetts in 1892 Actual observance varies in different parts of the United States, ranging from large-scale parades and events to complete non-observance. Most states do not celebrate Columbus Day as an official state holiday. Some mark it as a \\"Day of Observance\\" or \\"Recognition.‚Äù Most states that celebrate Columbus Day will close state services, while others operate as normal. San Francisco claims the nation's oldest continuously existing celebration with the Italian-American community's annual Columbus Day Parade, which was established by Nicola Larco in 1868, while New York City boasts the largest, with over 35,000 marchers and one million viewers around 2010. As in the mainland United States, Columbus Day is a legal holiday in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In the United States Virgin Islands, the day is celebrated as both Columbus Day and \\"Puerto Rico Friendship Day.\\" Virginia also celebrates two legal holidays on the day, Columbus Day and Yorktown Victory Day, which honors the final victory at the Siege of Yorktown in the Revolutionary War. = Non-observance = The celebration of Columbus Day in the United States began to decline at the end of the 20th century, although many Italian-Americans and others continue to champion it. The states of Florida, Hawaii, Alaska, Vermont, South Dakota, New Mexico, Maine, Wisconsin, and parts of California including, for example, Los Angeles County do not recognize it and have each replaced it with celebrations of Indigenous People's Day (in Hawaii, \\"Discoverers' Day\\", in South Dakota, \\"Native American Day\\"). A lack of recognition or a reduced level of observance for Columbus Day is not always due to concerns about honoring Native Americans. For example, a community of predominantly Scandinavian descent may observe Leif Erikson Day instead. In the states of Oregon and Washington, Columbus Day is not an official holiday. Iowa and Nevada do not celebrate Columbus Day as an official holiday, but the states' respective governors are \\"authorized and requested\\" by statute to proclaim the day each year.See: *Iowa proclamation: *Nevada proclamation: Nevada Revised Statues Chapter 236 , section 236.025 \\"Columbus Day\\" Several states have removed the day as a paid holiday for state government workers, while maintaining it either as a day of recognition, or as a legal holiday for other purposes, including California and Texas. The practice of U.S. cities eschewing Columbus Day to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day began in 1992 with Berkeley, California. The list of cities which have followed suit as of 2018 includes Austin, Boise, Cincinnati, Denver, Los Angeles, Mankato, Minnesota, Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Seattle, St. Paul, Minnesota, Phoenix, Tacoma, and \\"dozens of others.\\" Columbus, Ohio has chosen to honor veterans instead of Christopher Columbus, and removed Columbus Day as a city holiday. Various tribal governments in Oklahoma designate the day as Native American Day, or name it after their own tribe.  Latin American observance  = D√≠a de la Raza = Christopher Columbus Monument along Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico. The date Columbus arrived in the Americas is celebrated in some countries of Latin America. The most common name for the celebration in Spanish (including some Latin American communities in the United States) is the D√≠a de la Raza (\\"day of the race\\" or the \\"day of the [Hispanic] people\\"), commemorating the first encounters of Europeans and the Native Americans. The day was first celebrated in Argentina in 1917, in Venezuela and Colombia in 1921, in Chile in 1922 and in Mexico it was first celebrated in 1928. The day was also celebrated under this title in Spain until 1957, when it was changed to the D√≠a de la Hispanidad (\\"Hispanicity Day\\"), and in Venezuela it was celebrated under this title until 2002, when it was changed to the D√≠a de la Resistencia Ind√≠gena (Day of Indigenous Resistance). Originally conceived of as a celebration of Hispanic influence in the Americas, as evidenced by the complementary celebrations in Spain and Latin America, D√≠a de la Raza has come to be seen by nationalist activists throughout Latin America as a counter to Columbus Day; a celebration of the native races and cultures and their resistance to the arrival of Europeans in the Americas. In the United States, D√≠a de la Raza has served as a time of mobilization for pan-ethnic Latino activists, particularly since the 1960s. Since then, La Raza has served as a periodic rallying cry for Hispanic activists. The first Hispanic March on Washington occurred on Columbus Day in 1996. The name is used by the largest Hispanic social justice organization in the nation, the National Council of La Raza. = Argentina = Plaza de Mayo in Argentina \\"D√≠a de la Raza\\", with an imagen of Cristobal Colon, 1929. Argentine government poster from 1947 including the concept of la Raza. The Day of the Race was established in Argentina in 1916 by a decree of President Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen. The name was changed to \\"Day of Respect of Cultural Diversity\\" by a presidential decree in 2010 issued by President Cristina Kirchner. The statue of Columbus was removed from its original position near the Casa Rosada and replaced by one of Juana Azurduy, a patriot and leader in the struggle for independence who had indigenous ancestors. = Colombia = Colombia, whose name originated from Columbus himself, celebrates El d√≠a de la Raza y de la Hispanidad (meaning \\"Day of the Race and Hispanicity\\") and is taken as an opportunity to celebrate the encounter of \\"the two worlds\\" and to reflect on the richness that the racial diversity has brought to the culture. = Peru = In Peru, it was known as D√≠a del descubrimiento de Am√©rica (\\"Day of the discovery of America\\"). Since 2009, it has been celebrated as D√≠a de los pueblos originarios y el di√°logo intercultural (Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Dialogue Day). = Venezuela = Between 1921 and 2002, Venezuela celebrated D√≠a de la Raza along with many other Latin American nations. The original holiday was officially established in 1921 under President Juan Vicente G√≥mez. In 2002, under President Hugo Ch√°vez, the holiday was changed to D√≠a de la Resistencia Ind√≠gena (Day of Indigenous Resistance) to commemorate the Indigenous peoples' resistance to European settlement. On October 12, 2004, a crowd of pro-government activists toppled a statue of Christopher Columbus by Rafael de la Cova in Caracas. The activists also sprayed allusive graffiti over its pedestal. The Walk where the statue had stood was renamed in 2008 \\"Indigenous Resistance Walk\\". Later a statue of an indigenous leader, Guaicaipuro, was erected on the plinth. = Costa Rica = On September 21, 1994, Costa Rica changed the official holiday from D√≠a de la Raza to D√≠a del Encuentro de las Culturas (Day of the Encounter of Cultures) to recognize the mix of European, Native American (autochthonous populations), African and Asian cultures that constitute modern Costa Rican (and Latin American) culture and ethnicity. In accordance to the Costa Rican labor law, the holiday is observed on October 12. However, should this date coincide with a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, the employer shall agree that said holiday be postponed to the following Monday.  Caribbean observance  Only a handful of Caribbean countries observe holidays related to Columbus Day. In Belize, October 12 is celebrated as Day of the Americas or Pan American Day. In the Bahamas, it was formerly known as Discovery Day, until 2001 when it was replaced by National Heroes Day. In 1937, Cuban President Federico Laredo Br√∫ (1936‚Äì1940) spoke to the nation and countries of America in Cuba on October 12 commemorating Christopher Columbus's voyage to the New World. Federico Laredo Br√∫ spoke about Columbus' impact on the land and the future of its settlement. He ended his speech with venerating Christopher Columbus' efforts to colonize and establish settlements along the new front and the pride of ones nation. He added \\"Por mi raza hablo mi espiritu,\\" which translates to \\"For my race my spirit called,\\" in order to support the political infrastructure at the time. = Columbus' Legacy in the Caribbean = The Columbus Lighthouse in Santo Domingo Este, Dominican Republic December 1937, Cuban president Federico Laredo Br√∫ and Dominican Republic president Rafael Trujillo ordered a crew of aviators to travel through Latin America collecting funds from large capital cities for a monumental light house in the Dominican Republic. The exploration Escuadrilla Binacional Pro Faro de Col√≥n was inspired by Columbus's journey across the North Atlantic Ocean to America. The expedition consisted of three Stinson Reliant SR-9 borrowed from the Cuban Air Force - named Santa Mar√≠a, Ni√±a and La Pinta after the vessels commanded by Columbus - and a Curtiss Wright CW-19R from the Dominican military aviation named Colon after Columbus. On December 15, after visiting a majority of South America, their flight to the Peruvian capital Lima was hampered by an unexpected sandstorm. Two planes (Colon and La Pinta) were forced to land in Pisco and Ni√±a disappeared in the storm. The Santa Maria was the only plane to reach Lima as planned, landing at Las Palmas on the day of the storm. After extensive searches, Nina radioed their whereabouts after their radio was damaged in the storm. The aircraft restrategized in Las Palmas and on December 29 their expedition took off from El Techo airport in Bogot√° en route to El Guabito airport in California. Later that day, the crew flew into an unexpected storm over the Valley of Cauca. With minimal visibility and poor navigation, Ni√±a, La Pinta and Santa Maria crashed into high mountains, while Colon, unaware of the other aircraft, flew over the storm and safely made it to Panama City. The plane is preserved today as remembrance of the bravery of the crew and Christopher Columbus's journey. In 1992, in remembrance of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America, the Columbus Lighthouse, in Santo Domingo Este was inaugurated. The monument is both a mausoleum and a museum showcasing objects including a boat from Cuba and Colombian jewelry. Constructed of concrete, the monument is long. Its architecture is cross-shaped and represents the Christianization of the Americas. According to the Dominican authorities, remains of Christopher Columbus are sheltered at the lighthouse. However, Spanish authorities have proved through DNA tests that the remains in the Cathedral of Seville are the real remains of Columbus. The Dominican authorities haven't allowed the same DNA tests to be done to the remains in the lighthouse, so it is impossible to know if the remains of Columbus are divided or if the remains in the lighthouse belonged to another person. European observance = Italy = Monument to Christopher Columbus in Genoa, Italy Since the 18th century, many Italian communities in the Americas have observed the Discovery of the New World as a celebration of their heritage; Christopher Columbus (whose original, Italian name is \\"Cristoforo Colombo\\") was an Italian explorer, citizen of the Republic of Genoa.Charles Speroni, \\"The Development of the Columbus Day Pageant of San Francisco,\\" Western Folklore, Vol. 7, No. 4 (Oct. 1948), pp. 325‚Äì335.U.S. State Department, Bureau of International Information Programs. In Italy, Columbus Day has been officially celebrated since 2004. It is officially named Giornata nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo. The \\"Lega Navale Italiana\\" has created a Regata di Colombo as a celebration of the Columbus achievement. Italians have celebrated their \\"Cristoforo Colombo\\" naming after him many civilian and military ships, like the ocean liner SS Cristoforo Colombo. = Spain = Eternal flame. Since 1987, Spain has celebrated the anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the Americas as its Fiesta Nacional or \\"National Day\\". Previously Spain had celebrated the day as D√≠a de la Hispanidad, emphasizing Spain's ties with Hispanidad, the international Hispanic community. In 1981 a royal decree established the D√≠a de la Hispanidad as a national holiday. However, in 1987 the name was changed to Fiesta Nacional, and October 12 became one of two national celebrations, along with Constitution Day on December 6. Spain's \\"national day\\" had moved around several times during the various regime changes of the 20th century; establishing it on the day of the international Columbus celebration was part of a compromise between conservatives, who wanted to emphasize the status of the monarchy and Spain's history, and Republicans, who wanted to commemorate Spain's burgeoning democracy with an official holiday. Since 2000, October 12 has also been Spain's Day of the Armed Forces, celebrated each year with a military parade in Madrid. Other than this, however, the holiday is not widely or enthusiastically celebrated in Spain. There are no large-scale patriotic parades, marches or other events, but shops and businesses are closed as with other bank holidays. The observation is generally overshadowed by the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar (Fiestas del Pilar). This holiday was declared a religious feast day throughout the Spanish Empire in 1730. In recent years, celebration of the holiday has faced some opposition from various organizations.  Opposition to Columbus celebrations  Engraving by Theodor de Bry, depicting the controversial account by Bartolom√© de las Casas regarding the Brev√≠sima relaci√≥n de la destrucci√≥n de las Indias, 1552. De Bry's works are characteristic of the anti-Spanish propaganda that originated as a result of the Eighty Years' War, known as the Black Legend. Opposition to Columbus Day dates back to at least the 19th century, when anti-immigrant nativists sought to eliminate its celebration because of its association with immigrants from the Catholic countries of Ireland and Italy, and the American Catholic fraternal organization, the Knights of Columbus. Some anti-Catholics, notably including the Ku Klux Klan and the Women of the Ku Klux Klan, opposed celebrations of Columbus or monuments about him because they thought that it increased Catholic influence in the United States, which was largely a Protestant country. By far, the more common opposition today, decrying both Columbus' and other Europeans' actions against the indigenous populations of the Americas, did not gain much traction until the latter half of the 20th century. This opposition was initially led by Native Americans and was expanded upon by left-wing political parties. Two surveys, conducted in 2013 and 2015 by Rasmussen Reports, found 26% to 38% of American adults are not in favor of celebrating Columbus Day. There are many interrelated strands of criticism. One refers primarily to the treatment of the indigenous populations during the European colonization of the Americas, which followed Columbus's discovery. Some groups, such as the American Indian Movement, have argued that the ongoing actions and injustices against Native Americans are masked by Columbus myths and celebrations.Blackfoot Physics: A Journey into the Native American Universe, by F. David Peat, Weiser, 2005, , p. 310 American anthropologist Jack Weatherford says that on Columbus Day, Americans celebrate the greatest waves of genocide of the American Indians known in history. thumbleft250pxStatueless plinth in Caracas in 2006. A statue of Christopher Columbus, which formerly occupied the plinth, was knocked down by activists in 2004. A second strain of criticism of Columbus Day focuses on the character of Columbus himself. In time for the 2004 observation of the day, the final volume of a compendium of Columbus-era documents was published by the University of California, Los Angeles' Medieval and Renaissance Center. It stated that Columbus, while a brilliant mariner, exploited and enslaved the indigenous population. Spelman College historian Howard Zinn described some of the details in his book, A People's History of the United States, of how Columbus personally ordered the enslavement and mutilation of the native Arawak people in a bid to repay his investors. Journalist and media critic Norman Solomon reflects, in Columbus Day: A Clash of Myth and History, that many people choose to hold on to the myths instead of reality in the events surrounding Columbus. He disputes the idea that the Spaniards' arrival was beneficial towards the Indians by quoting History of the Indies by the Catholic priest Bartolom√© de las Casas, who observed the region where Columbus was governor. Las Casas writes that the Spaniards were driven by \\"insatiable greed\\" as they killed and tortured native populations with \\"the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty\\" and laments that \\"my eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write.\\" In the summer of 1990, 350 representatives from American Indian groups from all over the hemisphere, met in Quito, Ecuador, at the first Intercontinental Gathering of Indigenous People in the Americas, to mobilize against the 500th anniversary (quin-centennial) celebration of Columbus Day planned for 1992. The following summer, in Davis, California, more than a hundred Native Americans gathered for a follow-up meeting to the Quito conference. They declared October 12, 1992 to be \\"International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People.\\"A Faithful Response to the 500th Anniversary of the Arrival of Christopher Columbus in A Resolution of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, paragraph 1.

It is an inner-ring suburb of Minneapolis-Saint Paul. The population was 9,773 at the 2010 census. History In 1844, French Canadian settler Benjamin Gervais moved north from Saint Paul to claim land in order to build the first grist mill in Minnesota that was independent from the government. Today, the large lake on the east side of Little Canada bears his name (Lake Gervais). The grist mill was converted into a park, which is recognized as the birthplace of the city. Little Canada began as the township of New Canada in 1858. In the 1950s the township was threatened by the suburban sprawl of the ensuing larger communities that were formed, such as Maplewood. In 1953, the city leaders came together and established the village of Little Canada. It became a city in 1974. =Canadian Ties= The city displays the Canadian influence in its history in several ways. Its official symbol is an initial LC on a white fleur-de-lis with a red Maple Leaf background, and the Flag of Canada is displayed in council chambers.

It is a suburb of the Twin Cities. The population was 21,456 at the 2010 census. History In the mid 18th century, Mdewakanton Dakota tribes lived in the vicinity of New Brighton's marshy lakes, harvesting wild rice. The Dakota eventually settled a village near Long Lake at Rice Creek and a smaller encampment just east of Silver Lake Road on 3rd Street NW. Immigrants from Britain and France settled a small village in 1858 which included a general store, school and mission church. As railroads were established in the area, millers in Minneapolis formed the Minneapolis Stockyards and Packing Company in 1888. The company supplied home, agriculture, and business needs. The venture included Minneapolis figures such as streetcar magnate Thomas Lowry, flour millers John Sargent Pillsbury, Senator William D. Washburn, ex- Minneapolis Mayor W.H. Eustis, and industrialist W.H. Dunwoody. As the village grew in prominence, it was incorporated on January 20, 1891. The city was given the name Brighton after Brighton, Massachusetts. The founding population was primarily English-American.http://www.ci.new- brighton.mn.us/index.asp?Type=B_LIST&SEC;=%7B2790088B-DA5F-4FAC-955D-4A608A855E2F%7D Each August, a city festival celebrates this heritage, called the Stockyard Days and is held at Long Lake Park. As the streetcar system expanded in the early 20th century, immigrant and first-generation groups from Eastern Europe and Germany began moving outwards from Northeast Minneapolis. New Brighton and St. Anthony residents also continue to celebrate this ethnic heritage with an annual Polka Dance Party which began in 1892. In the 1920s, a local farmer said he heard a rumor that gold bars were buried along the eastern shore of Long Lake by bootleggers. This rumor spread and in the following years launched a mini \\"gold rush\\" along Long Lake to find the treasure. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Rice Creek flows through the northern part of the city.King's Twin Cities Metro Street Atlas '04. Minneapolis: The Lawrence Group. 2004. . New Brighton is located at the intersection of Interstate Highways 35W and 694. It is geographically incongruent. From north to south it is not even, and east to west it is even in only a few places. A piece of the city sits on the east side of Interstate 35W isolated from the rest of the city. Nearby places include Arden Hills, Shoreview, Roseville, Saint Anthony Village, Columbia Heights, Fridley, Mounds View, and Minneapolis. New Brighton has several parks, including Richard J. Hansen Park, Freedom Park, Sunny Square Park, Creek View Park, Meadow Wood Park, Hidden Oaks Park, Silver Oaks Park, Innsbruck Park, Veterans Park, Vermont Park, and Long Lake Regional Park. Bur oak trees over 200 years old and native prairie grass such as Big Bluestem can be found in Long Lake Park. Remnants of old farmsteads can be found at Long Lake Park as well (look for lilacs and rose bushes in the middle of the woods). New Brighton is almost exactly halfway between the equator and the north pole, with a latitude of 45 degrees. New Brighton is part of east‚Äìcentral Minnesota's glacial plain sandpile, which was flattened by glaciers during the most recent glacial advance. During the last glacial period, massive ice sheets at least thick ravaged the landscape of the town and sculpted its current terrain which can be easily seen in Long Lake Regional Park within the city. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. Since the New Brighton landscape is still recovering from the weight of the glaciers and going through post-glacial rebound and the turmoil this created, the landscape is poorly drained created the numerous lakes and rivers found in the city. Long Lake itself is the remnants of the glaciers, as it was a chunk of ice that was left behind, melted, and created the lake in the hole it occupied.

New Brighton's first-place finish followed years of work by the Police Division's Crime Prevention Unit to build a strong network of neighborhood crime watch captains and agency volunteers and to promote participation in National Night Out by citizens from all segments of the community. Education Four public schools are located in New Brighton: Bel Air Elementary School, Sunnyside Elementary, Highview Middle School, and Irondale High School; additionally, until 2005, when it was converted into a community education center, there was a fifth public school located in New Brighton: Pike Lake Elementary School, now known as Pike Lake Education Center. All of these schools are part of the Mounds View Public Schools (District 621). * Bel Air Elementary is located on 5th Street NW, and serves 672 K‚Äì5 students from New Brighton. * Sunnyside Elementary is located on County Road H, and serves 518 K‚Äì5 students from New Brighton and Mounds View. * Highview Middle School is located on 7th Street NW, and serves 814 6‚Äì8 grade students from New Brighton, Arden Hills, and Roseville. * Irondale High School is located on Long Lake Road, and serves 1,577 9‚Äì12 grade students from New Brighton, Mounds View, and Shoreview. Nearby private high schools attended by residents include Totino-Grace in Fridley, Minnehaha Academy in Minneapolis, or Breck School in Golden Valley. High school students in a portion of eastern New Brighton attend nearby Mounds View High School. Students from southern New Brighton formerly attended Mounds View, but the district lines were redrawn to send more students to Irondale to alleviate overcrowding. A small fraction of New Brighton students attend Wilshire Park Elementary and Saint Anthony Village Middle and High Schools in nearby Saint Anthony Village, as part of New Brighton is served by ISD 282. Irondale High School was listed as one of the top 500 schools in the country by Newsweek in 2000 and 2003,msnbc although it had a notoriously bad football team in the late 1990s. They won only 4 games during all of the 1996‚Äì1999 seasons. Although, in 2007 Irondale had its best season for football, winning 8 games and defeating Totino-Grace (the current state champions) although this great season was a nice change of pace for the Irondale community, they were bounced from the playoffs in their first game losing to White Bear Lake. However, the school has one of the most renowned marching bands in the state of Minnesota/USA. After bringing home top honors during the 1990s at many large state competitions, the Marching Knights are nationally recognized as being a high-ranking, proficient marching band. They often make finals at regional Bands of America competitions. B.O.A. is the largest national contest for many marching bands across America. Marching Knights website The band placed second at the 2006 Youth in Music Band Championships held at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Irondale also has the largest Drama program in the Mounds View School District. Four productions are put on yearly, as well as a competition one act play. This high school was also mentioned in the movie In the Line of Fire starring Clint Eastwood. The assassin Mitch Leary tells a bank teller he grew up in Minneapolis and went to New Brighton high school. Media The local newspaper of New Brighton, The Bulletin, keeps New Brighton residents informed on various events in the city, and it is particularly thorough on two accounts: it details all of the crime in the northern suburbs and it reports on sporting events of New Brighton's Irondale High School. (Another local newspaper, the Sun Focus, details events occurring in the tri-city New Brighton-Mounds View-St. Anthony Village area.) The Bulletin ceased publication in late 2019. Water Groundwater is pumped from 12 deep wells, ranging from 300 to deep. The groundwater is located in three aquifers: Prairie du Chien, Jordan and Mt. Simon/Hinckley. New Brighton's water is classified as very hard with 17 to 20 grains per gallon (290 to 340 g/m¬≥). Water hardness is due principally to calcium and magnesium and water is generally harder in areas where calcium and magnesium rich limestone rocks are present. New Brighton pumps some of its water from aquifers in dolomite/limestone rock formation. Groundwater pollution was discovered in the late 1980s in New Brighton along with Arden Hills and St. Anthony, which came from chemical dumping at the nearby Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant. Following litigation settlement, the U.S. Army provided New Brighton and the surrounding northern suburbs with clean water supplies and new systems to monitor and filter pollution. Additional contamination was discovered in 2015. The city has switched wells until the contaminants can be cleaned.

The questioner replies that there is no New Brighton High School, but she can't remember the name of the high school in New Brighton. This exchange proves to be important to the plot.

The land was later purchased by Saint Paul magnate James J. Hill in 1883 and expanded into a breeding and hobby farm. His son Louis Hill later owned North Oaks Farm until death in 1950. Ownership passed to Louis' children who decided to develop the land into a model residential community. They incorporated the North Oaks Company with a mission to build with respect for the natural environment, having witnessed metropolitan sprawl during this time. To ensure their mission would be fulfilled, land was subdivided and sold with a warranty deed that created the North Oaks Home Owners‚Äô Association (NOHOA) to be responsible for roads and recreation. Each deed placed each home's property line halfway into the street, placing all roads into private ownership. Remaining land in the city is owned by the North Oaks Company. The original farm buildings have been restored with informational displays. They are not open to the public however as North Oaks is private. Two of the remaining structures, the Blacksmith Shop and Machine Shop and Dairy Building, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In May 2008, NOHOA sent a letter to internet search company Google, stating that its Street View software contained images that violated their trespassing ordinance, and requested their removal. Google complied, so there is no street view available for the roads within North Oaks.

History Brooks was established in 1904 as a station on the Soo Line Railroad. By 1926, Brooks had two general stores, a grocery store, a bank, hardware store, butcher shop, blacksmith shop, a livery barn, two saloons, a community hall and a hotel to accommodate travelers. Brooks was primarily a service town for the surrounding agricultural townships, and a creamery was established as the local dairying business developed on neighboring farms. After the invention of the cream separator, family farms in adjoining townships of Polk and Red Lake counties switched from subsistence agriculture to a market economy and became a part of the dairy industry. =Brooks Cheese Company= In 1926, the Brooks creamery was purchased by the owners of the cheese factory in nearby Terrebonne who moved their operation to Brooks. The business was widely known as the Brooks Cheese Company. It was a cheese factory owned by the Parenteau family, which sold its product to the Kraft Foods company, and marketed its products throughout the Midwest. Local farmers would process the milk from their own cows by removing the butterfat or cream, which was hauled in cream cans to the cheese factory, while the skim milk or whey was fed to hogs raised on the same farm. The Brooks Cheese Company continued in business until the late 1970s, at which point the decline of the family farm and the predominance of monoculture and industrial agriculture eliminated the mixed agriculture that formerly had predominated in the area of Brooks. Although the local history of Red Lake County blames the National Farmers Organization for organizing farmers to cooperative actions in withholding milk shipments, the reality is that Brooks Cheese Company could not compete with the major industrial cheese manufacturers and the development of agribusiness which portended the demise of the family farm. By the beginning of the 21st century, few dairy cows could be found within twenty miles of Brooks, whereas at one time virtually every quarter section could be counted on for the cream produced by 10 or 15 cows. Nonetheless, Brooks continues to be the site of an agricultural supply business, a gas station, and several other local businesses, as well as one church.

The population was 1,427 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Red Lake County. The city lies in the middle of Red Lake Falls Township from which it was separated when incorporated as a village in 1881. Its status was raised to that of a city in 1898. History Red Lake Falls was the site of a North West Company fur post as early as 1796 or 1797, making it one of the oldest sites of European occupation in the State of Minnesota. A French Canadian fur trader, Jean Baptiste Cadotte, partner of the noted British-Canadian fur trader, Alexander Henry the elder, established the post as part of a strategy to ward off Hudson's Bay Company intrusion into the Red River Valley. The famous Canadian explorer David Thompson took shelter from a storm in Cadotte's cabin here in March 1798.See D'Arcy Jenish, Epic Wanderer: David Thompson & The Mapping of the Canadian West (2003), at pages 103-04 The post was abandoned early in the 1800s, as British fur traders withdrew from United States territory. The surrounding territory was homesteaded by French-American settlers led by Pierre Bottineau, who were relocating via ox cart from their temporary stopping points in Ramsey and Hennepin Counties, Minnesota, in 1876. These pioneers were augmented in 1878 by a number of French Canadian settlers from Upper Canada. The area developed as a grain farming region. In 1878, Earnest Buse and his partner, Otto Kankel, established a flour mill at the confluence of the two rivers. The town of Red Lake Falls soon after was platted by Mr. Buse, who then moved on to other environs. The Kankel family continued as a prominent presence in the town through the 1950s. The town prospered for a time, as both the Northern Pacific Railway and the Great Northern Railway ran their lines through the town in the 1880s and early 1890s (both lines are now abandoned), and when Red Lake County split off from Polk County, in 1896, Red Lake Falls became the county seat of the newly formed county, a reason for existence that persists to the present day. The population peaked shortly afterward, in 1900, and has been in decline ever since. The last significant historic event in Red Lake Falls occurred on August 27, 1927, when the famous aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife landed at the nearby airport during a barnstorming trip through the Upper Midwest and were taken on automobile rides to Huot and Crookston.

The Wednesday night ice cream social at the United Methodist Church kicks off the celebration and always draws a good turnout. For the athletes, Fun Days hosts one of the area's best volleyball tournaments and a softball tournament. The parade typically draws 50+ floats and is a favorite for the locals. There is also a flea market in the park and a treasure hunt in which a medallion is hidden and the finder gets a prize. The street dance brings live music to town and ropes off a beer garden with burgers and hot dogs. After the band calls it a night, the younger adults typically find themselves at one of the many late-night house parties hosted throughout town. Fun Days serves as a homecoming of sorts for many of the city's former residents and a great chance to catch up with some long- lived camaraderie.Danube Area Action Club - Danube Notable people * Bob Bruggers - Former NFL linebacker and professional wrestler.Patrick Reusse: Parade and dedication leave many touched  Star Tribune  References   External links   City-Data.com * ePodunk: Profile for Danube, Minnesota Category:Cities in Minnesota Category:Cities in Renville County, Minnesota ","title":"Danube, Minnesota"},{"id":"121536","text":"Emmet Township is a township in Renville County, Minnesota, United States.

History Hector was founded in 1878 when the Hastings and Dakota Railway Company constructed the railroad on the north side of the original town site. The ten-block town site survey was completed on September 14, 1878, on land owned by the Hastings and Dakota. The village was named after the township of Hector, which had been organized in June 1874. It was originally named Milford, but the name was changed when it was learned there was already another Milford in Minnesota. There was heated debate between those who favored the name Plainfield (after the stage stop and post office) and those who favored the name Hector, a township in New York on the east shore of Seneca Lake where many of the early settlers came from. Hector, New York, was named after the bravest of the ancient Trojan warriors whose story is told in Homer's \\"Iliad\\".

The milling industry contributed greatly to Dundas' 19th-century success, and at one point the mills in Dundas were considered among the best in the world.Marjorie A. Lund, National Register of Historic Places Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form, January 6, 1976; copy accessed from Edward T. Archibald House file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. The Ault Store is the only remaining commercial building from Dundas' original business district. The city's original central business district was located on Second Street, and by 1866 it included two general stores, a library, hotel, shoe store, restaurant, meeting hall and saloon. The neighborhood began to shift once the Minnesota Central Railway built its station on the west side of the river, resulting in the development of Railway Street and the platting of the Railway Addition in 1865. All that remains of the original commercial district is the Ault Store (built in 1866), which started as a general store and housed the town's first library on the second floor; the same building also served as the home of the Dundas News for its operation from 1876-79 when it was bought and absorbed by the Northfield News.Britta Bloomberg, Minnesota Historic Properties Inventory Form, February 1981; copy accessed from Ault Store file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. The Archibald Mill, Adult Store and Edward T. Archibald House are among the five local structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, the town is chiefly a bedroom community for nearby Northfield and the more distant Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. The juxtaposition of Dundas and Northfield and their disparate zoning policies and attitudes toward development have led to some unusual growth patterns. Dundas is home to a number of businesses, such as an off-sale liquor store and two bars that would be unable to get licenses to operate in Northfield. Contrary to popular opinion and local lore, Dundas Technical University (Dundas Tech) only exists on T-shirts and jokes from Northfield and Faribault natives. Dundas has the only public feed mill within about 40 miles. It is operated by Interstate Mills on the site of the original grain elevator. In 1999, the threat of a Target store being sited in Dundas‚Äîrather than Northfield‚Äîwas instrumental in forcing changes to Northfield's zoning to allow such uses. A Union Pacific freight railroad line passes through Dundas. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

It is the county seat. The population was 23,352 at the 2010 census. Faribault is approximately south of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Interstate 35 and Minnesota State Highways 3, 21, and 60 are four of the main routes in the community. Faribault is situated at the confluence of the Cannon and Straight Rivers in southern Minnesota. History Faribault is regarded as one of the most historic communities in Minnesota, with settlement and commercial activity predating Minnesota's establishment as a U.S. Territory. Until 1745, the area was primarily occupied by the Wahpekute band of Dakotah. Shortly thereafter, the tribe was driven south after several clashes with the Ojibwe over territory. Main Street, circa 1898 Faribault City Hall The city's namesake, Alexander Faribault, was the son of Jean-Baptiste Faribault, a French-Canadian fur trader, and Elizabeth Pelagie Kinzie Haines, a Dakotah woman.Faribault Life and Times. \\"Alexander Faribault Before the Story: 1806-1855\\" He is credited with fueling most of the early settlement in the area, beginning in 1826, when he established a fur trading post on the banks of the Cannon River. By 1834, the trading post had grown in popularity and was relocated to the Straight River, one mile (1.6 km) upstream of its junction with the Cannon River, the site of modern-day Faribault. The young Alexander Faribault used his knowledge of Dakotah language and culture to improve relations with the displaced Wahpekute and even helped the tribe to resettle in the area. This relationship was instrumental in ensuring the success of the trading post and allowing safe travel to the area for settlers. Another source maintains the city is named for Jean-Baptiste Faribault. The Alexander Faribault House was built in 1853 by Alexander Faribault at a cost of $4,000. It is considered the oldest framed structure in the area, and still stands in its original location near the southeastern edge of Faribault's historic downtown district. The years following the construction of this first building brought unprecedented growth, development, and economic prosperity to the young settlement. Spurred by the completion of the area's first steam-powered sawmill in early 1854, the next year took Faribault from a sleepy settlement of 20 buildings to a bustling town with more than 250. Historians attribute Faribault's impressive growth during this period to a number of important milestones in 1855 and 1856, including the creation of roads connecting to other settlements and trading posts in Iowa and Minnesota Territory, the availability of mail service, and the construction of schools and churches. The City of Faribault was platted in 1855 and granted a home-rule charter in 1872. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water. The confluence of the Straight River and the Cannon River is located within city limits. Sakatah Lake State Park and Nerstrand-Big Woods State Park are nearby. Interstate Highway 35 runs along the western edge of the city. The city is served by two full interchanges and one partial interchange. Before I-35's completion, traffic was routed through town, generating significant sales revenue to the retailers that had a major highway running past their doors. In approximately 1975, the last portions of I-35 were completed and through traffic started to bypass Faribault. On that same corridor through town, the White Sands Swimming Pool (\\"Minnesota's Largest Outdoor Swimming Pool\\") operated from 1964 to 1977. This swimming area is now the White Sands Dog Park, as well as the trailhead for the Sakatah Singing Hills Trail, which runs to Mankato. The Mill Towns Trail is planned to run to Northfield. The site includes parking, restrooms and a shelter. Demographics =2010 census= As of the census of 2010, there were 23,352 people, 8,317 households, and 5,208 families living in the city.

Many buildings are being restored to their original appearance. Among them is the Paradise Center for the Arts, a multipurpose art center that is the result of a merger between the Faribault Art Center and the Faribault Area Community Theatre. Two longtime Faribault retailing/shopping institutions closed: the oldest, a longtime Central Avenue fixture, Jim & Joe's Clothiers closed after 125+ years of service due to a number of related factors. The other, Minnick's Food Market, was Faribault's last mom-and-pop grocery store and closed after 60+ years of operation in late 2006.

The population was 3,674 at the 2010 census. History Prior to the American Civil War, a number of families of Czech descent had begun migrating to south central Minnesota from Bohemia. In 1878, a small settlement of Norwegian farmers built a Lutheran church slightly to the southeast of present day Lonsdale. They called the area Trondhjem, after the name of the city in Norway from which they had descended. In 1891, a proposed new railroad from Mankato to Farmington was reported in the New Prague Times. However, construction of this railroad was never initiated due to an economic downturn. It was the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway that proceeded with plans for their existing branch line from Wells to Mankato, to begin constructing trackage northeastward into Farmington. The extension of this line would bring the possibility of development, population growth and job opportunities to towns along the prospective line such as Cleveland, Le Sueur Center, Veseli and New Market. But the businesses of the Veseli area favored the construction of a spur line of the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway (M & St. L) from New Prague instead. In July and August of 1901, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway created their right-of-way with the purchase of a 100 foot wide strip of land that ran through the Trondhjem settlement and was therefore also a few miles south of Veseli. At the end of 1901, landowner Thomas Wilby entered into an agreement with the Milwaukee Land Company to develop 40 acres of his property. But the contract stipulated that he must first convey land to the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway that was necessary to build a train depot. The Milwaukee Land Company would then survey and plot the remaining acres of Wilby's land in order to establish a village. By January of 1902, a total of 80 acres had been plotted as a new town site. On July 16, 1902 a grand opening of the town of Lonsdale was held as lots were auctioned for sale. Businessman Martin Benzik purchased several of these lots, and constructed the first buildings in Lonsdale: a saloon, a hotel and a livery stable. The railroad tracks were laid in town on August 1, 1902, and a 20,000 bushel grain elevator was opened on the other side of the railroad tracks from the depot. To be closer to the railway, some former residents of Veseli placed their homes on skids and pulled them to Lonsdale, using steam tractors. In May of 1903, Martin Benzik and other businessmen petitioned for incorporation of the land, known as the Village of Lonsdale. A public election was set for July 1, 1903, and with a vote of 24-0 in favor of incorporation, the city of Lonsdale was born. The initial population of the city was 84 people. The building of the Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception was completed by the fall of 1904, a rectory was built alongside the church in 1907, and the Catholic school was built in 1912. Also in 1907, the city water tank was built, and the public school house was constructed in 1908. Calvary Hill Cemetery was established south of Lonsdale in 1910. Several theories exist as to how Lonsdale got its name, but it remains a mystery. One theory is that the town was named after the surveyor from the railroad. Another possibility is that it was named for another place named Lonsdale, either in the United States or England. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water. Minnesota State Highway 19 serves as a main route in the city.

History  The Osmund Osmundson House, c. 1890s. In 1856, Norwegian immigrant Osmund Osmundson moved to Wheeling Township in Rice County. He homesteaded the present site of Nerstrand, building a house and farm, and began to envision a town on the site. In 1877 he built a store on what became the right-of-way for railroad tracks on what is now Main Street. In 1885 the Minnesota and North Western Railroad (later the Chicago Great Western Railway) was constructed, extending from Lyle, Minnesota to St. Paul, and Osmundson platted the town on the line, naming it after his hometown of Nedstrand in Tysv√¶r, Norway.Britta Bloomberg, Minnesota Historic Properties Inventory Form, February 1981; copy accessed from Osmund Osmundson House file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. The town was the center of a significant Norwegian immigrant community, which included people in the surrounding township and county. Some, like Osmundson and Tosten Bonde (who lived just outside the city limits), became state legislators.Britta Bloomberg, Minnesota Historic Properties Inventory Form, February 1981; copy accessed from Bonde, Totsen, Farmhouse file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center.Osmundson, Osmund, Minnesota Legislative Reference Library, Accessed December 9, 2010.Johnson, Tosten \\"T., Tostin\\", Minnesota Legislative Reference Library, Accessed December 9, 2010. Thorstein Veblen, who grew up just outside the town, became a noted sociologist and economist. The town incorporated in 1897 and its first city hall was built that year. It proved too small within a few years, and a new city hall was built in 1907.Britta Bloomberg, Minnesota Historic Properties Inventory Form, February 1981; copy accessed from Nerstrand City Hall file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. Nerstrand City Hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 6, 1982, alongside the Osmund Osmundson House and the Bonde Farmhouse. The Thorstein Veblen Farmstead became a National Historic Landmark. The railroad tracks have been removed.  Law/government  Nerstrand has four city council members and a mayor. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The town was notorious for the nearby Nerstrand Hill, bane of the locomotive engineer, with the steepest grade on the line from St. Paul to Manly Junction, Iowa.  School  The town has an elementary school for grades K-5, Nerstrand Elementary School, operated by Faribault Public School ISD#565 as a charter school under state law.Nerstrand Elementary School, Faribault Public Schools The school has 155 students as of the 2019-20 school year.  Attractions  Nerstrand-Big Woods State Park is nearby. The nearby Valley Grove Church Building is considered an important historical site, though several active churches around the area are better preserved: * St. John's United Church of Christ (3 mi southwest) * Grace Lutheran Church (ELCA) (in town) * Nerstrand United Methodist Church (in town) * Gol Lutheran Church (ELCA) (4 mi southeast)  Economy  Throughout its history, Nerstrand has been a source of services to area farmers. A full- service grain elevator still operates today and provides over half the employment in Nerstrand. The business district declined with the advent of the automobile, with most area residents choosing to shop in Northfield, which has always been more prominent because of its two colleges, or Faribault, the county seat. As businesses left, Nerstrand became more of a bedroom community for people working in Northfield, Faribault, or Kenyon. A few nonretail businesses, including a cabinet shop and two specialty construction firms, have come to the community, occupying what would otherwise be vacant storefronts.

History The word Greenbush comes from \\"Sha Ach Wah,\\" which means spruce tree or green bush in Ojibwe. Scandinavian, Polish and Bohemian settlers arrived in the area in 1880s, with the largest influx immigrating in the early 1890s. The Homestead Act gave free to settlers if they set up living quarters and develop a few acres into the fields. The original setting of the city was on a ridge of what used to be the shores of ancient Lake Agassiz. This village is now referred to as \\"Old Greenbush,\\" and is marked by Hvidso cemetery (also known as Pioneer Haven) along Highway 11. In 1904, the Great Northern railroad came to the area. It expanded north from Thief River Falls to where present day Greenbush is, where it stopped construction. Greenbush merchants moved their businesses, buildings and all, to the new town known as \\"West Greenbush.\\" They did this by rolling the buildings along logs, with horses tied up to posts and walking beside them. Businesses remained open during the moving days.Greenbush, MN, 1905-2005 A few years later, the rail line to Warroad was completed and ran directly through the old town site.

Portions of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) tribal lands are within the boundary of the City of Prior Lake as annexed in 1972. The SMSC is a federally recognized, sovereign Native American tribe of Mdewakanton Dakota people. The overlap of a Minnesota Statutory City with federally recognized Indian Tribal lands resulted in litigation to clarify the boundary and voting rights. In a 1984 United States District Court ruling, the court affirmed that the municipal boundary of the City of Prior Lake did include the tribal lands in question. The Court further clarified that the tribal residents were thus residents of the City of Prior Lake entitled to vote in municipal elections and to emergency police, fire, and rescue services. The Court ordered the City to provide emergency services on an equal basis as all other residents even though the federal trust status of the tribal lands deprives the City of the authority to tax the tribal lands to fund such services. In recent years, the SMSC has paid the City of Prior Lake for the cost of those emergency services on a voluntary basis.United States District Court, District of Minnesota, Third Division.

The city is situated on the south bank of the Minnesota River in a region commonly referred to as South of the River, comprising the southern portion of Minneapolis-St. Paul, the sixteenth largest metropolitan area in the United States. The population of Savage was 26,911 at the 2010 census. Minnesota State Highway 13 and County Road 42 are two of the main routes in Savage. Interstate 35W and U.S. Highway 169 are in close proximity to the city. The landing point for Irish and Scottish immigrants in 1800, Savage has grown into a developing bedroom community, absorbing population growth from Burnsville, its larger neighbor to the east. Once a shipbuilding port for the U.S. Navy, Savage is now an industrial manufacturing job center in the southern metro. The city is still relatively undeveloped, with sections of the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge and Murphy- Hanrehan Park Reserve within its borders. Previously named Hamilton after the city in Ontario, Canada, the town was renamed Savage after Marion Willis Savage who owned and trained the nationally celebrated racing horse Dan Patch. History In the 17th century, French fur traders and explorers explored the Minnesota River valley. After 1750, Mdewakanton Dakota then settled at Chief Black Dog's camp‚Äînear what is now Black Dog Lake in Burnsville. Dakota used the Minnesota River valley region including present day Savage for fish, game, boating and camping. In 1852, traders established a small post at the confluence of the Credit River and the Minnesota River. William Byrne, who immigrated from County Kilkenny, Ireland, to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, in 1840, arrived in the area shortly after, via steamboat from Fort Snelling. Already established in business and trade, he and other Irish and Scottish settlers built Hamilton Landing, a port for boats, named after the city he immigrated to in Canada. The town incorporated in 1892 as the village of Hamilton. Byrne later settled another nearby area which became Burnsville. The Chicago & Northwestern (present day Union Pacific Railroad) railway line reached the site in 1865, and in 1866 the town gained a post office. Hamilton became the crossroads of trade and service in the region with the Credit River, Minnesota River, the valley's wagon and road trails, and the rail line. The post office was later renamed Glendale Post Station in 1894 and formed Glendale Township to the west of Hamilton but was later consolidated with Savage in 1969. The roughly 17 blocks of the late 19th-century town remain as Savage's downtown along Highway 13 (Minnesota). In 1902, Minneapolis entrepreneur Marion Willis Savage purchased racing horse Dan Patch and trained and raced him at his farm in the limits of Hamilton. Dan Patch's notoriety grew as the horse began breaking speed records and with it the prestige of the town. In 1904 the townspeople renamed the community after Savage with the post office officially confirming. In 1906 at the Minnesota State Fair, Dan Patch broke the world pacing mile record at 1 minute and 55 seconds, a record that remained unsurpassed for 54 years. During World War II, Savage was home to Camp Savage, a Military Intelligence School (MIS) language program, which taught Japanese to American military personnel. Established in 1942, the school trained with niseis and improved military intelligence of the time. It was later relocated to Fort Snelling and the camp is commemorated at Normandale College's Japanese garden. At about the same time, Cargill, Incorporated, began building ships for the U.S. Navy at the newly constructed Meadowland Shipyard, renamed Port Cargill (former site of Hamilton Landing). To launch the ships, of the Minnesota River were dredged down to from Savage to the Mississippi River confluence. About 3,500 people were employed during peak production resulting in 18 auxiliary oil and gas carriers and 4 tugboats constructed. After World War II the port began shipping agricultural commodities.The towboat J.L. Fleming brings empty grain barges into Port Cargill on the Minnesota River, a tributary of the Mississippi River. Savage remained undeveloped in the post-war housing boom, isolated by the Minnesota River and without a direct interstate connection. Lack of available construction materials in the immediate area also prevented development. By the 1980s, with the upgrade of Highway 13 and construction of the Highway 169 Bloomington Ferry Bridge in 1996 across the Minnesota River, Savage's population finally boomed as one of the growing exurb cities with low cost greenfield land in the metropolitan area. The citizens of Savage reclaimed some of their history in the early 21st century, when it relocated the displaced Savage Depot built in 1880 by the then Chicago, Minneapolis and Omaha Rail Road.

In late February 2020, firefighters responded to a report of a fire at Northern Metals Recycling in Becker. Northern Metals Recycling moved its operations from Minneapolis to Becker the year before, after being ordered to shut down by the Pollution Control Agency due to high levels of air pollution. The fire was reported to have started under a pile of cars. The fire lasted several days, and caused schools to close in order to conduct air quality testing. More than three dozen fire departments were reported to have been on scene. Eventually, it was decided in tandem with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Minnesota Department of Health that the best course of action would be to let the fire burn out. This decision was also influenced by the fact that water resources were being quickly depleted from Becker and the neighboring vicinity.

History Big Lake was originally called Humboldt until 1867. Big Lake was originally established to harvest ice in both of its towns' lakes. Due to the rich amount of ice Big Lake provided, it needed to be transported quickly, enabling Big Lake to be suitable for a railway station which was built in 1871. Big Lake was served by both the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railroad, later Burlington Northern Railroad, now BNSF Railway. The city was host to a station of both GN and NP railways until the NP station burned in 1918, in later years both railroads shared a depot. The depot no longer stands. Culture Big Lake is known locally for its annual summer festival \\"Spud Fest,\\" which celebrates all things potato-related.

It is situated at the confluence of the Mississippi and Elk Rivers. The population was 22,974 at the 2010 census, making Elk River the second largest city in the Central Minnesota region after St. Cloud. It is the county seat. The city's population exceeded 20,000 as of year 2005.Elk River, Minnesota (MN) Detailed Profile ‚Äì relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders U.S. Highways 10 and 169 and State Highway 101 are three of the main routes in Elk River, and a station on the Northstar Commuter Rail line to downtown Minneapolis is located in the city. Elk River is located 33.2 miles northwest of Minneapolis and 37.4 miles southeast of St. Cloud. History The hardwood-forested hills in which Elk River is situated were pushed up by the last glacier that advanced across Minnesota. These hills are made up of coarse materials which is the reason gravel mining is so prevalent in Elk River, and also the reason much of the area is not considered good farmland. To the south of Elk River lies the prairie. This natural boundary between the prairie and woods was also a boundary between Indian nations. Two battles between the Dakota and Ojibwe took place where the Elk River meets the Mississippi in 1772 and 1773. =Rivers= The Elk River Water Tower was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Zebulon Pike passed through the area on his 1805 exploration of the Upper Mississippi River and named the Elk River after the herds of elk he saw in the area. David Frederic Faribault, son of French-Canadian fur trader Jean-Baptiste Faribault built a trading post near the conjunction of the Elk and Mississippi Rivers in 1846, which he later sold, in 1848, to French trader and guide Pierre Bottineau. The trading post stood on a bluff just east of the present day bridge across the Elk River on main street. Bottineau also built a hotel in 1850 on the bank of the Mississippi about a half mile below the mouth of the Elk. The two rivers and the Red River Trail, which passed nearby, made this area a good location for commerce. A large number of early settlers came from Maine and nearly all of them were experts in lumbering. In 1851, Ard Godfrey, a native of Orono, Maine, saw the potential of the water power of the Elk River and built a dam and a sawmill. His dam created the first lobe of Lake Orono (called the Mill Pond), which extended from the present day dam to Orono Cemetery Point. In 1855, the area by the dam was platted and the town of Orono (known as Upper Town) was created. In the latter half of the 19th century, agriculture and dairy farming replaced lumber as the base of Elk River's economy. Grist mills and a starch factory, which took advantage of the potato fields to the west, were built. The Orono-Elk River area continued to grow until by 1860 it had reached a population of 723 people. These early settlers typically came from New England. Elk River's population continued to grow following a slow period caused by the civil war. The majority of people moving to Elk River by that time were from Northern Europe. The village of Elk River was platted in 1865, replatted in 1868, and when incorporated in the winter of 1880‚Äì1881, included both Orono and Elk River. By 1870, Elk River swelled to a population of 2,050 and became the county seat in 1872. Around this same time, the railroads replaced the rivers as the main focus of transportation and the Lower Town (the present day historic downtown area) replaced Upper Town as the focus of commerce. The Orono Dam was destroyed by an ice storm in 1912, but hydropower gave a new incentive to dam the Elk River in 1915. This new dam created the four lobes of Lake Orono as we know it today. In 1916, the Village of Elk River received electricity for the first time. The entire township of Elk River would not get electricity until after World War II. =Road transportation= Charles Babcock, a native son of Elk River and the first Commissioner of Highways for the state, had a visionary plan to \\"get Minnesota out of the mud.\\" His plan to create a network of paved roads became a model for the rest of the nation and the Jefferson Highway (now Highway 10) became one of the first paved roads in the state. Highway 10 used to cross the Elk River over the dam bridge, but was rerouted to its present location shortly after World War II. Jackson Avenue used to be Highway 169. For years, the intersection of this road and Highway 10 was the only one with a stoplight in Elk River and on major travel weekends, traffic would back up half way to Anoka. Work on Highway 169 to bypass Elk River began in 1961. Work on a new route for Highway 101 between Rogers and Elk River began in 1968. In 1974, the Village of Elk River changed to the City of Elk River. In 1978, the City of Elk River and the township of Elk River were consolidated to create one unit known as the City of Elk River as it exists today. The result was one of the largest land-based cities in the state of Minnesota, at 44 square miles. Besides transportation, energy has always played a significant role in shaping Elk River. The first rural nuclear power plant in the United States went online in 1960 as Great River Energy's (GRE) site in Elk River. It was meant only as a demonstration site and was dismantled after several successful years of operation. =Energy City= In the late 1980s, GRE's power plant was converted to burn refuse-derived fuel. This innovative source of energy was one factor that helped Elk River receive the designation of \\"Energy City\\" by the Minnesota Environmental Initiative in October 1997. As Energy City, Minnesota's energy industries demonstrate cutting edge renewable and energy efficient technologies in Elk River. By the 1990s, Elk River and Sherburne County were in one of the fastest growing corridors in the state and in the country. This population growth and the area's high commuter rate factored into the ultimate approval and implementation of the Northstar Commuter Rail service from Minneapolis to Big Lake, which began service on November 16, 2009. Attractions The City of Elk River offers many amenities to its residents, offering a small town feel but close enough to the Twin Cities and St. Cloud. =Art= Downtown Murals In 1991, K.S. \\"Bud\\" Houlton commissioned the painting of the first downtown mural. The mural, depicting the former buildings on the south side of Main Street circa 1960, captured the spirit when downtown was the center of the business community. Mr. Houlton had a great interest in local history, and created the mural as a gift to the community. Mr. Houlton's son, John, clearly remembers the businesses depicted in the painting. He stated the bakery and barber shop are still in operation today, but the business names have changed. The artist is Michael Russell. In 2001, the Three Rivers Community Theater applied for a grant to assist in providing monies towards the painting of a mural of an artistic and historical significance on the building adjacent to the River's Edge Park, located at the intersection of Main Street and Jackson Avenue. This effort to have a mural painted was inspired by numerous community members, business owners, and public entities interested in downtown beautification and continuing to recognize the arts community of Elk River. This project enhanced the social, cultural, and leisure of downtown Elk River. The desire was to draw attention to the Mississippi River for its beauty and solace as well as its historical significance to Elk River. Local artist Frank Gosiak created and painted the mural.'  Whimsical Windmill  The \\"whimsical windmill\\" is the art piece that was chosen in the Elk River Powered by Nature Art Contest. Artist Carl Zachmann from Fergus Falls created the piece in reminiscent of the windmills on farms that pump water. The gears and representing colors stand for the rivers, the confluence of both rivers, forest and lumber that helped build Elk River, and a reminder of the prairie that help the area's agriculture to flourish. The base of the windmill is designed to represent the river. The windmill is located on the grounds of the Elk River Library. Art Elk River has always been a town energized by its local artists, showcasing talented residents.

The population in was 886 at the 2010 census.  History  Henderson was founded in August 1852 by Joseph R. Brown, and was named for his mother's maiden name. By 1855, Henderson had become a fast-growing city. It harbored more than 60 buildings, including a hotel, a warehouse, a steam sawmill, as well as Brown's house which functioned as a boarding house, a store and a residence for the Brown family. In the following years, Henderson quickly became a major distribution center for the inland settlements surrounding the Minnesota River Valley. By the mid-1860s, Henderson had two major brickyards, The Mattei and Schwartz Brickyard, who both contributed heavily to the early 1900s brick-style buildings still present in Henderson today. The seat for Sibley County was originally established in Henderson, and an imposing courthouse was erected, being put into service in 1879. However, pressure from residents of Gaylord, from as far back as 1887, to gain the county seat precipitated a county-wide vote in 1915. That vote resulted in Gaylord gaining the seat; this caused around 200 residents to leave Henderson, a major decline in the city's population. Throughout the 50 years after this population loss, Henderson's economy became increasingly more centered on agriculture. Its success in transitioning to agriculture brought rise to the present Sauerkraut Days celebration. The former courthouse, now designated 'Henderson Community Building', houses Henderson City offices.
