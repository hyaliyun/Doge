Described as a \\"sinister, interdimensional bureaucrat\\", he is known to display peculiar behavior and capabilities beyond those of normal humans. Throughout the story of the Half-Life series, the G-Man plays the role of an overseer and employer: he navigates player- character Gordon Freeman's insertion to, or extraction from, the game-world on several occasions, and his monologues with Freeman reveal his importance to the series' overall narrative. He claims to answer to some unseen higher authority, which he refers to as his \\"employers\\". His mysterious nature has made him an icon of the Half-Life series, with his identity and motives remaining almost completely unexplained. Concept and creation The G-Man's name comes from \\"G-Man\\", an American colloquialism meaning \\"government man\\". However, within the Half-Life games, he is identified by this name only in the program code and the multiplayer profile menu as a default name option, not within the story itself. His name is derived from his Half-Life model and entity name and has since been reused in subsequent games of the series. His name has been confirmed and referred to in documentaries featuring Valve employees, as well as in the voice-actor credits for Half-Life 2 and in the book about game development: Raising the Bar. A description of the G-Man's nature is given in the comment section of the file \\"npc_G-Man.cpp\\" in the Source SDK file \\"sourcesdk.gcf\\": \\"// Purpose: The G-Man, misunderstood servant of the people.\\" In the official Half-Life audio script, the G-Man is referred to as \\"Administrator\\", suggesting he is the one overseeing experiments. This title was later retconned to refer to Wallace Breen. Frank Sheldon, the person on whom the G-Man's Half-Life 2 model is based, was originally slated to be the model for Dr. Breen. It was chosen for the G-Man's appearance after Bill Van Buren created a modified image of Sheldon, with chopped-off hair and a scaled-down face shape. Doug Wood, who designed the facial expressions of the Half-Life 2 G-Man model, wanted the player to never quite know what side the G-Man was on by giving him ambiguous facial expressions. Appearance and behavior The G-Man appears throughout the series either in monologue scenes that occur at key points in the story or in live gameplay, where he can be seen briefly in far-off background areas or locations that the player cannot access until later in the level where he has disappeared. The character has the appearance of a middle-aged, light-skinned male with a tall and thin physique, pale/chalky skin, dark brown hair shaped in a military-style crew cut with a prominent widow's peak, blue-green eyes, a purple tie and usually holding a briefcase. He is conservative in appearance, dressed in an ordinary gray/blue two-piece business suit. The book Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar states that his appearance in Half-Life 2 is based on Frank Sheldon. The G-Man speaks in a slow, raspy yet commanding manner, with a certain accentuated low- key moroseness to his tone, sometimes placing unusual stress on syllables, stressing the wrong parts of words, making unneeded pauses, inhaling sharply and audibly throughout his speech, and awkwardly changing the pitch of his voice, sometimes in the middle of a word. At the end of Half-Life 2, the G-Man emphasizes the word \\"time\\" repeatedly as well, most likely referring to the fact that moments before, he seemingly stopped time. It is common for the G-Man to elongate \\"S\\" sounds. His odd manner of speaking, along with his appearance, alludes to the behavior of the men in black in various reports, and the apparent age and physical status of the G-Man does not seem to change in the time that passes between Half-Life and Half-Life 2 (which, according to the Episode One website, is nearly twenty years). The G-Man exudes a calm, almost uninterested demeanor ‚Äì in situations in which other humans panic and flee, the G-Man can be seen calmly straightening his tie or brushing his suit lapels with his hand. When developing the G-Man in Half-Life 2, animator Doug Wood stated, \\"I wanted the player to never quite know what side the G-Man was on. I would have him express an apologetic look toward Freeman as he 'regretted' to put Dr. Freeman in this situation, but then give a slight smirk or smile at the end to keep you guessing about his sincerity.\\"Valve; Hodgson, David SJ (2004), p. 137. Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar. Random House, Inc. Before animating the G-Man's facial expressions, Wood spent weeks in front of a mirror practicing the expressions on himself. He is voiced by Mike Shapiro.https://www.pcgamer.com/the-g-man-speaks-for-the-first-time- in-12-years/ Presence At the start of Half-Life 2, a Vortigaunt is seen speaking to the G-Man on a television. During the final chapter of Half-Life 2, Doctor Breen speaks to Gordon Freeman, stating he has \\"proven himself a fine pawn for those who control him\\", and informing Freeman that his \\"contract was open to the highest bidder\\".Half-Life 2 In the introduction to Half-Life 2: Episode One, the Vortigaunts are able to directly confront him. They restrict his abilities to manipulate Gordon through a purple barrier; allowing Gordon to exit stasis and return to City 17. In Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Eli Vance indicates that he also knows the G-Man, referring to him as \\"our mutual friend\\". Additionally, in Episode Two, Alyx Vance is directly spoken to by the G-Man while she is unconscious, and then repeats the words to her father per his instructions, confirming that she and the G-Man have come into contact. In Half-Life: Alyx, the G-Man is absent from most of the story and is constrained in a levitating prison by the Combine called the Vault. After he is freed by Alyx Vance, he pulls her into his dimension. Alyx mistakes him for Gordon Freeman, which amuses the G-Man. Alyx asks who he is, but he refuses to answer, saying \\"what\\" he is, is not important. Instead, he offers his services to her. Alyx requests that the G-Man remove the Combine from Earth, but he stresses that this order would contradict the interests of his \\"employers\\". He offers an alternate service, subjecting her to a future event and giving her the power to kill the Advisor that would murder her father. Alyx does so and saves Eli's life, where the G-Man points out she has proven a worthy successor to Freeman, who he claims to have grown dissatisfied with due to Freeman's inability or refusal to carry out his orders. Alyx asks that he send her home, but the G-Man simply replies she misunderstands the situation before forcing her into stasis. Abilities The G-Man appears to have many inhuman abilities. He seems to have the power to appear in any place he chooses, including moving to and from other dimensions on a whim. He is also able to stop or slow down time at various points. In Half-Life, the G-Man will repeatedly appear in places that he should not be able to exit unnoticed or at all, yet has disappeared by the time the player can reach these areas. At the very end of Half-Life 2, on top of the Citadel, he halts time completely during a huge explosion that would have killed Gordon and Alyx. The G-Man seems to be able to take people into \\"parallel universe\\"-like \\"voids\\" and put them into stasis. In most games featuring the G-Man, there are several sequences when he is talking at close range to the player, and various areas can be seen in the background, including areas from Black Mesa or even areas the player will visit later into the game. In these sequences, the G-Man talks to the player (the player's character never responds or reacts in any way, except in Half-Life: Alyx) and can be seen quickly appearing in different portions of the screen, in dream-like sequences. He also appears on TV screens and \\"Breen-casts\\" dotted around the environment; the G-Man also seems to have technopathy or other telepathic abilities, as the player will occasionally see his face on pieces of technology such as unplugged televisions. The G-Man is seen operating a wide range of machinery, from cellular phones and sealed steel doors to nuclear warheads and teleporters. In addition, he appears to have the ability to plant subconscious suggestions or commands in others through psychic or hypnotic means, as he demonstrates on Alyx Vance in Half- Life 2: Episode Two by ordering her to relay a phrase to her father Eli Vance, which she does with no apparent awareness of what she was doing. He also hints at having additional, unseen powers in Half-Life 2: Episode Two and Half-Life: Alyx. The G-Man expresses regret at not being able to do more than keeping an eye on Gordon Freeman, claiming his employers have given him \\"restrictions\\".https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21192318/half-life-alyx- episode-2-ending-gordon-freeman-crowbar Reception GameDaily listed the G-Man as number 5 of the top 25 evil video game masterminds of all time at 2008. The G-Man is famous in the Garry's Mod community for his numerous humorous poses, exaggerated facial expressions and/or as a running joke in many videos, relayed by the YTMND community. He was placed as the fourth \\"biggest freak\\" on PlayStation's games by PlayStation Official Magazine. TheGamer also included and claimed G-Man as the best meme character ever.https://www.thegamer.com/half-life-3-hilarious-memes-long-awaited-sequel- real-fans-love/ References External links * \\"The Story So Far\\" ‚Äì from Valve's official Episode One Web site. * The G-Man on Combine OverWiki, an external wiki Extraterrestrial characters in video games Fictional businesspeople in video games Fictional characters without a name Fictional technopaths G-Man Male characters in video games Telepath characters in video games Video game characters introduced in 1998 Video game characters who can teleport Video game characters who have mental powers pl:Lista postaci ze ≈õwiata Half-Life#G-Man ","title":"G-Man (Half-Life)"},{"id":"21208422","title":"Muhammad Kazim Ali Khan"},{"id":"21208425","text":"Carex occidentalis is a species of sedge known by the common name western sedge.

This agency was created originally to implement the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP). Subsequently the DRDAs were entrusted with number of programmes of both state and central governments. From April 1999http://rural.nic.in/sites/downloads/right-information-act/DRDA_RTI.pdfa separate DRDA Administration has been introduced to take care of the administrative costs. This aims at strengthening the DRDAs and make them more professional in managing the anti-poverty programmes and be an effective link between the ministry and the district level. Rural development and poverty alleviation programmes are implemented on a decentralised basis, keeping in view the large geographical areas, the administrative requirements and the need to involve grassroots-level officials and the community in the implementation of the programmes. At the central level the Ministry of Rural Areas & Employment has been implementing these programmes. The Ministry is responsible for the release of central share of funds, policy formulation, overall guidance, monitoring and evaluation of the programmes. At the State level Prl Secretary, Rural Development and the Commissioner of Rural Development are overall incharge for implementation of the rural development programmes. At the District level, the programmes are implemented through the DRDAs (District Rural Development Agencies). The governing body of DRDA includes Members of Parliament (MPs), Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs), District level officials of Development Departments, Bankers, NGO's and representatives of weaker sections of the society. The District Collector used to be (but not always at present) the Chairman of the Governing Board. The Governing body at the district level provides guidance and directions to DRDA. The body in DRDA responsible for actual implementation is headed by an Additional District Collector. Many Schemes of the Central and State Governments are introduced from time to time. Several schemes are available providing support to different components of Rural Development. Schemes are also periodically modified to reflect the experience over the years. The task of DRDA has been to identify the needs of the rural population and reach the appropriate schemes where they are needed. In implementing the schemes, the role of the DRDA has been Technical, Managerial and Financial. Thus DRDA is not only a body to disburse the funds for the schemes but also provide appropriate Managerial and Technical support. District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs) are district level development execution and monitoring agencies created under the Indian Societies Registration Act. Substantial sums of rural development funds of government of India were transferred and routed through them under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes. From purely a financial resource from Rural Development point of view the DRDAs are extremely important institutions at the district level. kalyan kumar Context of decentralization  With the adoption of the Constitutional mandate for decentralization of powers that privileged those self-government institutions in planning for economic development and social justice, the proposal to re- think the status of DRDAs and also to merge them with the panchayats had emerged. Under the section on 'devolution of functionaries' the 1st Round Table had adopted a resolution, number IV(i), for reconceiving the role of District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs). DRDAs were to be progressively merged with the District Panchayats and their technical expertise made available to all tiers of Panchayats. At an all India level, the progress reported in this regard is far from satisfactory. There are some vexed issues, one among which is the 'reported' reluctance on the part of some of the institutions of Union Government for the proposal of merger of DRDAs with the district Panchayats. The complete merger seems to have happened only in Kerala and Karnataka. The latter has a much longer history of doing this. In both the States the DRDAs function as if they were the cells for poverty alleviation/ rural development schemes within the Zilla Panchayats. West Bengal is reported to have taken similar steps; yet, it does not measure up to the yardstick of complete merger. Rajasthan and Lakshadweep State/ UT Profile make a similar assertion; this report is unable to confirm this. Status of DRDAs in the States In 10 States/ UTs the DRDAs continue to be separate with the only linkage established with the ZPs is making the President of ZP the Chairperson of the DRDA. These are Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha , Punjab, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Lakshadweep. In Gujarat the District Development Officer, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Panchayat, continues to chair the DRDA. In nine States/ UTs either the Collector continues as the Chair or some other arrangement has been made in this regard. These are Assam, Goa, Haryana, Jharkhand, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, and Pondicherry. Andhra Pradesh has made the Zilla Panchayat President the Chair of the DRDA while designating the Collector as the Executive Chairperson. Similarly, in Maharashtra, while the President Zilla Panchayat is made the Chair of the DRDA, the Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Panchayat is designated as the Executive Chairman of the Management Committee.See The state of panchayats : 2007-08 , An independent assessment, Volume I : Thematic reports P 55 Table : Status of DRDAs in the States {class = \\"wikitable\\" !Sl.

He was the oldest son of Sir Henry Bacon, 3rd Baronet and his wife Sarah Castleton, daughter of Sir John Castleton, 2nd Baronet. In 1686, he succeeded his father as baronet. He studied at St John's College, Cambridge. Between 1700 and 1708, Bacon represented Orford and sat as Member of Parliament (MP) in both the Parliaments of England and Great Britain. He served as High Sheriff of Suffolk in 1665. On 25 December 1688, he married Philippa Bacon, daughter of his cousin Sir Edmund Bacon, 4th Baronet, of Redgrave at Redgrave, Suffolk. Philippa died in 1710 and Bacon married again Mary Castell, daughter of John Castell at Raveningham on 16 April 1713.

It replaces the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, after the Guinness company withdrew interest in chart reference books at the same time their contract was due to expire.

Two years later Virgin took over the contract from The Official Charts Company to publish the re-branded version of the book as The Virgin Book of British Hit Singles without the album charts information. Content The first edition of the book lists every act to have a chart hit in the UK top 75 singles chart between 1952-2008 (first quarter of the year). Unlike its predecessor it only lists the chart weeks spent in the top 40 if the single has ever charted high enough during its chart run to do so, while Guinness listed all weeks spent in the top 75. Selected acts have a mini-biography with their entry in the book, while other sections of the book have reports on the charts, such as how they have changed due to the event of digital downloads having an effect. The main section of the book contains the Top 75 UK hit singles, which are separated into the artists; solo singers, duets, groups and bands. The song titles, along with the highest UK Chart position, and number of weeks in Top 40 are included. The first edition featured this information along, with a list of all the songs in an A-Z list at the end of the book, for easy reference. The second edition of the book, referred to as 'Volume 2', was published in 2010 and had a number of changes, including the addition of a new section listing all the UK No. 1 singles from 1952 until the book was completed in early 2010. It also gave more information about each artist underneath their names, such as the lead singer, the year of birth, nationalities and a brief history or overview.

A very recognisable and prominent peak of the Black Mountains, it lies near the end of the more westerly of Waun Fach's two broad southern ridges. Its top Pen Twyn Glas is to the north, while its close neighbour Pen Cerrig-calch is to the south.Nuttall, John & Anne (1999). The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 1: Wales (2nd edition ed.). Milnthorpe, Cumbria: Cicerone. . A prominent spur 1km to the SSW of the summit is known as Pen Gloch-y-pibwr. The stepped Bryniog ridge curves southward from this point. Its summit is stony and has damaged Bronze Age cairns and a large shelter cairn together with a trig point. Further Bronze Age cairns are found along the western edge of the plateau to the south.  Geology  The summit of Pen Allt-mawr is at the northern tip of a broadly triangular summit surface formed from a slab of southerly tilting upper Old Red Sandstone traditionally known as the Quartz Conglomerate. These rocks which date from the Late Devonian Epoch are continuous with those of Pen Cerrig-calch but other than a tiny outlier forming the summit of Sugar Loaf, are found nowhere else within the Black Mountains. Beneath the Quartz Conglomerate are the Early Devonian sandstones of the Brownstones Formation which form the upper slopes and summits of Pen Twyn Glas and Mynydd Llysiau to the north (though are barely seen). More readily eroded mudstone bands within this formation give rise to the stepped appearance of this hill and many of its neighbours. Sandstones of the Senni Formation (traditionally the 'Senni Beds') form the lower slopes of the mountain.

In it the Court of Appeal of England and Wales decided that tenders and requests for tenders are accompanied by a collateral contract implying that the requestor will give due consideration to any timely bid.Poole (2004) p.45 Facts Blackpool Borough Council ran Blackpool Airport, and gave a licence to a single company to run pleasure flights to and from the airport. Blackpool & Fylde Aero Club had held this licence since 1975, and had been granted it again in 1978 and 1980. In 1983 the current licence was due to expire, and the council sent out letters to seven organisations, including the Aero Club, inviting new tenders to a licence to operate light and heavy aircraft from the airport, requiring a reply to be at the Town Hall 'not later than 12 o'clock noon on Thursday 17 March 1983'. Three organisations replied, two of which sent in light bids for only the lighter class of aircraft. The Aero Club sent in a significantly higher bid for both classes of aircraft, and placed their offer in the Town Hall letter box at 11 am on the 17th, an hour before the deadline. The Town Clerk's staff failed to empty the letter box at 12 noon as they were expected to do, and as a result the letter was not considered 'delivered' until after the deadline, and the licence was granted to one of the other bidders, Red Rose Helicopters. After discussions between the Aero Club and the Council it became apparent the letter had been delivered on time, and the Council decided to rectify the situation by declaring the previous round of tenders invalid and inviting the submission of new tenders. At this point Red Rose Helicopters, having consulted their lawyers, informed the Council that they were contractually bound to grant the licence to them. As a result of this the Council withdrew their offer of a second round of tenders, and pursued the contract with Red Rose Helicopters. The case went to the High Court of Justice, where the judge found in favour of the club. The Council appealed, and it was taken to the Court of Appeal, where Roger Toulson QC and Hugh Davies represented the Council, and Michael Shorrock QC and Paul Sylvester represented the Aero Club Judgment Bingham LJ's leading judgement read: Stocker LJ agreed with Bingham LJ, and added: Farquharson LJ agreed with the other two judges, and made no comment.

His concept of what theater should be begins beyond the stage, out in the streets face to face with the public.

That site is at a location called in Arabic Ramat al-Khalil (the older name used by archaeologists) and currently Bir al-Haram ar-Rameh, which is a few kilometres north of the site described in this article. After the mid-12th century, the traditional location of the Oak of Mamre migrated to different sites, the most prominent being the current location outside the church. History Abraham's Oak in 1912. Slabodka Yeshiva at the Oak of Mamre c. 1927. The Oak of Mamre in 2008. As written in a footnote from an 1895 publication of Arculf's pilgrimage report, \\"[t]he Oak or Terebinth of Abraham has been shown in two different sites. Arculf and many others (Jerome, Itin[erarium] Hierosol[ymitanum], Sozomen, Eucherius [possibly Eucherius of Lyon], Benjamin of Tudela, the Abbot Daniel,.... etc.) seem to point to the ruin of er R√¢meh, near which is Beit el Khulil, or Abraham's House, with a fine spring well. This is still held by the Jews to be the Oak of Mamre. The Christians point to another site, Ball√ªtet Sebta, where there is a fine specimen of Sindian (Quercus Pseudococcifera).\\" Ballut is the Arabic word for oak. The site of the oak was acquired in 1868 by Archimandrite Antonin (Kapustin) for the Church of Russia, and the Monastery of the Holy Trinity was founded nearby. The site has since been a major attraction for Russian pilgrims before the revolution, and is the only functioning Christian shrine in the Hebron region. After the Russian Revolution, the property came under the control of the ROCOR. A long- standing tradition is that the Oak of Abraham will die before the appearance of the Antichrist. The main oak trunk has appeared to be dead since 1996. Following construction work in the 1970s, a wooden ring in the form of a chalice was built around the tree, and its roots began to die. In 1997, a small sprig was seen growing near the withered oak. In October 2016, Russian botanists began a project to save the tree. In 1998 a root sprout appeared. The Hebron Monastery has emerged as a political issue between Russia and Palestinian authorities.

Self-designation also varies: In Central and Eastern Europe, Roma is common. The Romani of England call themselves (in Angloromani) Romanichal, those of Scandinavia (in Scandinavian romanidialect) Romanis√¶l. In German-speaking Europe, the self-designation is Sinti, in France Manush, while the groups of Spain, Wales and Finland use Kalo/Kale (from kalo meaning \\"black\\" in Romani language). There are numerous subgroups and clans with their own self- designations, such as the Kalderash, Machvaya, Boyash, Lovari, Modyar, Xoraxai, LƒÉutari, etc. In the English language (according to OED), Rom is a noun (with the plural Rom√° or Roms) and an adjective, while Romany is also a noun (with the plural Romanies) and an adjective.

The Oxford English Dictionary states a 'gipsy' is a According to the OED, the word was first used in English in 1514, with several more uses in the same century, and both Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare used this word.Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Edition 1989. \\"Gipsy, gypsy, n.\\" This exonym is sometimes written with a capital letter, to show that it designates an ethnic group. The Spanish term gitano, the French term and the Basque term have the same origin. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the name was written in various ways: Egipcian, Egypcian, gypcian. The word gipsy/gypsy comes from the spellings which had lost the initial capital E, and that is one reason that it is often spelled with the initial g in lowercase. As time elapsed, the notion of 'the gipsy/gypsy' altered to include other associated stereotypes such as nomadism and exoticism.

A timecode is necessary for the synchronization of automation. Modern mixing consoles and digital audio workstations use comprehensive mix automation. The need for mix automation originates from the 1970s and the changeover from studios mostly using eight-track tape machines to multiple, synchronized 24-track recorders. Mixing could be laborious and require up to four people, and the results could be almost impossible to reproduce. Manufacturers such as Solid State Logic and AMS Neve developed systems which enabled one engineer to oversee every detail of a complex mix, although the computers required to power these desks remained a rarity into the late 1970s. According to record producer Roy Thomas Baker, Queen's 1975 single \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was one of the first mixes to be done with automation.  Types  ;Voltage Controlled Automation : fader levels are regulated by voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCA). VCAs control the audio level and not the actual fader. ;Moving Fader Automation : a motor is attached to the fader, which then can be controlled by the console, digital audio workstation (DAW), or user. ;Software Controlled Automation : the software can be internal to the console, or external as part of a DAW. The virtual fader can be adjusted in the software by the user. ;MIDI Automation : the communications protocol MIDI can be used to send messages to the console to control automation.  Modes  ;Auto Write : used the first time automation is created or when writing over existing automation ;Auto Touch : writes automation data only while a fader is touched/faders return to any previously automated position after release ;Auto Latch : starts writing automation data when a fader is touched/stays in position after release ;Auto Read : digital Audio Workstation performs the written automation ;Auto Off : automation is temporarily disabled All of these include the mute button. If mute is pressed during writing of automation, the audio track will be muted during playback of that automation. Depending on software, other parameters such as panning, sends, and plug-in controls can be automated as well. In some cases, automation can be written using a digital potentiometer instead of a fader. See also * Online editing * Potentiometer * List of music software References * Stanley R. Alten.

(1987), \\"How to Integrate CAD/CAM Systems: Management and Technology\\", p. 237-238. CRC press. .  Computer-aided process planning  # CAPP is a linkage between the CAD and CAM module. # Process planning is concerned with determining the sequence of individual manufacturing operations needed to produce a given part or product. # The resulting operation sequence is documented on a form typically referred to as a \\"Route Sheet\\" (also called as process sheet/method sheet) containing a listing of the production operations and associated machine tools for a work part or assembly. # Process planning in manufacturing also refers to the planning of use of blanks, spare parts, packaging material, user instructions (manuals) etc. # # # # # # # As term \\"computer-aided production planning\\" is used in different contexts on different parts of the production process; to some extent CAPP overlaps with the term \\"PIC\\" (production and inventory control). # As the design process is supported by many computer-aided tools, computer-aided process planning (CAPP) has evolved to simplify and improve process planning and achieve more effective use of manufacturing resources. Process Planning is of two types: # Generative type computer aided process planning. # Variant type process planning. * Routings which specify operations, operation sequences, work centers, standards, tooling and fixtures. This routing becomes a major input to the manufacturing resource planning system to define operations for production activity control purposes and define required resources for capacity requirements planning purposes.  Computer-aided process planning initially evolved as a means to electronically store a process plan once it was created, retrieve it, modify it for a new part and print the plan. Other capabilities were table-driven cost and standard estimating systems, for sales representatives to create customer quotations and estimate delivery time.  Future development  Generative or dynamic CAPP is the main focus of development, the ability to automatically generate production plans for new products, or dynamically update production plans on the basis of resource availability. Generative CAPP will probably use iterative methods, where simple production plans are applied to automatic CAD/CAM development to refine the initial production plan. A Generative CAPP system was developed at Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant (BYJC) in Beijing, China as part of a UNDP project (DG/CRP/87/027) from 1989‚Äì1995. The project was reported in \\"Machine Design Magazine; New Trends\\" May 9, 1994, P.22-23. The system was demonstrated to the CASA/SME Leadership in Excellence for Applications Development (LEAD) Award committee in July 1995. The committee awarded BYJC the LEAD Award in 1995 for this achievement. In order to accomplish Generative CAPP, modifications were made to the CAD, PDM, ERP, and CAM systems. In addition, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) was built to handle the scheduling of tools, personnel, supply, and logistics, as well as maintain shop floor production capabilities. Generative CAPP systems are built on a factory's production capabilities and capacities. In Discrete Manufacturing, Art-to-Part validations have been performed often, but when considering highly volatile engineering designs, and multiple manufacturing operations with multiple tooling options, the decisions tables become longer and the vector matrices more complex. BYJC builds CNC machine tools and Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) to customer specifications. Few are duplicates. The Generative CAPP System is based on the unique capabilities and capacities needed to produce those specific products at BYJC. Unlike a Variant Process Planning system that modifies existing plans, each process plan could be defined automatically, independent of past routings. As improvements are made to production efficiencies, the improvements are automatically incorporated into the current production mix. This generative system is a key component of the CAPP system for the Agile Manufacturing environment. In order to achieve the Generative CAPP system, components were built to meet needed capabilities: #Shop floor manufacturing abilities of BYJC were defined. It was determined that there are 46 major operations and 84 dependent operations the shop floor could execute to produce the product mix. These operations are manufacturing primitive operations. As new manufacturing capabilities are incorporated into the factory's repertoire, they need to be accommodated in the spectrum of operations. #These factory operations are then used to define the features for the Feature Based Design extensions that are incorporated into the CAD system. #The combination of these feature extensions and the parametric data associated with them became part of the data that is passed from the CAD system to the modified PDM system as the data set content for the specific product, assembly, or part. #The ERP system was modified to handle the manufacturing abilities for each tool on the shop floor. This is an extension to the normal feeds and speeds that the ERP system has the capability of maintaining about each tool. In addition, personnel records are also enhanced to note special characteristics, talents, and education of each employee should it become relevant in the manufacturing process. #A Manufacturing Execution System (MES) was created. The MES's major component is an expert/artificial intelligent system that matches the engineering feature objects from the PDM system against the tooling, personnel, material, transportation needs, etc. needed to manufacture them in the ERP system. Once physical components are identified, the items are scheduled. The scheduling is continuously updated based on the real time conditions of the enterprise. Ultimately, the parameters for this system were based on: :a. Expenditures :b. Time :c. Physical dimensions :d. Availability The parameters are used to produce multidimensional differential equations. Solving the partial differential equations will produce the optimum process and production planning at the time when the solution was generated. Solutions had the flexibility to change over time based on the ability to satisfy agile manufacturing criteria. Execution planning can be dynamic and accommodate changing conditions. The system allows new products to be brought on line quickly based on their manufacturability. The more sophisticated CAD/CAM, PDM and ERP systems have the base work already incorporated into them for Generative Computer Aided Process Planning. The task of building and implementing the MES system still requires identifying the capabilities that exist within a given establishment, and exploiting them to the fullest potential. The system created is highly specific, the concepts can be extrapolated to other enterprises. Traditional CAPP methods that optimize plans in a linear manner have not been able to satisfy the need for flexible planning, so new dynamic systems will explore all possible combinations of production processes, and then generate plans according to available machining resources. For example, K.S. Lee et al. states that \\"By considering the multi- selection tasks simultaneously, a specially designed genetic algorithm searches through the entire solution space to identify the optimal plan\\".

After the Protestant Reformation it was donated to the university and was inaugurated in 1545 by Martin Luther as the Universit√§tskirche (University Church of ), later also called Unikirche.

Samuel R√ºling was music director in Leipzig, also for the Paulinerkirche, from 1610 to 1612, when he moved on to the Kreuzkirche in Dresden. Werner Fabricius was the first \\"Director musices Paulini\\" (director of music of St Paul) from 1656 to 1679. He was succeeded by Johann Schelle (1679‚Äì1701) and Johann Kuhnau (1701‚Äì1722).Leipziger Universit√§tsmusik / Gro√üe Tradition - Vielf√§ltige Gegenwart uni-leipzig.de 2011 An organ at the western wall was first heard on 2 November 1679. In 1717 the new organ by Johann Scheibe was inspected by Johann Sebastian Bach in his function as an organ consultant. Johann Gottlieb G√∂rner was the organist from 1717. His comment was: \\"nicht gnugsam r√ºhmen und loben k√∂nnen, sonderlich deren Raren Register\\" ([he could] not praise enough, especially its unusual stops). When Bach was cantor in Leipzig from 1723, he also performed \\"festal\\" (holiday) services at the Paulinerkirche in 1723-25, while G√∂rner was director for regular Sunday services. Possibly Bach performed a new cantata already for Pentecost, Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten, BWV 59, on 16 May 1723, before he began his tenure as cantor at the Thomaskirche and the Nikolaikirche two weeks later, Sunday after Trinity. On 17 October 1727 Bach performed the funeral ode La√ü, F√ºrstin, la√ü noch einen Strahl, BWV 198, requested by the university to mark the death of Christiane Eberhardine, the wife of August II the Strong. Bach performed his motet Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226, first on 21 October 1729 in a memorial service for Johann Heinrich Ernesti (1652-1729), rector of the Thomasschule. Probably in 1733, Bach performed his cantatas La√üt uns sorgen, la√üt uns wachen, BWV 213 (Hercules at the Crossroads), for the birthday of the heir to the throne of the elector, and T√∂net, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten! BWV 214, for the birthday of the queen, a cantata which he used as a model for parts of his Christmas Oratorio, namely its opening chorus. Probably in 1735 Bach performed the homage cantata Die Freude reget sich, BWV 36b, to Johann Florens Rivinius on his appointment to the Rectorship of the university in October 1735. In 1778 Johann Adam Hiller was appointed music director and served until 1785. = 19th century = During the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, the church served as a camp for hostages and a military hospital. In the 19th century most of the remaining buildings of the monastery were demolished and replaced by the Augusteum, built from 1831 to 1836. The church had originally faced the city walls, which were torn down in 1785. The church faced the new representative square, later called Augustusplatz. Therefore Albert Geutebr√ºck erected in 1836 a Neoclassical facade, replaced by a Neo-Gothic facade of Arwed Ro√übach in 1897. Felix Mendelssohn conducted his oratorio on the church's patron saint, Paulus, in the first performance in Leipzig on 16 March 1837.Paulus Oratorium 2011 .

This arbitrary act was not prevented by municipal councillors or by the Leipzig University. They did not resist the pressure of a dictatorial regime. The church survived the war practically unscathed, unlike the Augusteum next to it. On 4 April 1968 the Leipziger Universit√§tschor performed Bach's St Matthew Passion, conducted by Hans-Joachim Rotzsch. On 30 May 1968, under the communist regime, and after a decision by the SED-led city administration and the university administration, the Paulinerkirche was dynamited to make way for a redevelopment of the university, eventually carried out between 1973 and 1978. Protestors against the blasting operation were arrested. A plaque at the site was unveiled 25 years later, on 30 May 1993.

It is funded by members and run independently, though is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB). The service covers the following sectors: passenger and freight train operators, light rail, Network Rail and its suppliers, London Underground, and Transport for London (TfL) bus operators.  History  CIRAS was originally created in 1996 by a team from Strathclyde University. Other rail lines expressed interest in the project and several rail lines in Scotland voluntarily joined the system. After the Ladbroke Grove rail crash in 1999, John Prescott mandated that all mainline rail in the UK come under CIRAS effective in 2000. From 2001 until 2009, the CIRAS Charitable Trust provided funding for operations, before it formally became part of RSSB. As well as providing a service to all UK rail workers and operating throughout England, Scotland and Wales, CIRAS extended its reach to include London bus operators early in 2016. Outside London, Stagecoach UK and Lothian buses are now members too.  Operation  CIRAS provides a reporting process for UK transport workers to report incidents or concerns about rules and procedures, facilities, equipment, or training and briefing. Reports can be raised via telephone call, text, paper form, or via web enquiry form. Regardless of the way in which a report was raised, a Reporting Analysts will always interview the reporter and ensure that the final report does not contain any information that might identify him or her. These reports are sent to the responsible company for review, action, and response. The original reporter receives a written copy of the response provided by the company. It is worth nothing that the responding company does not have to be the one the reporter works for (for example, a train driver might receive a response from Network Rail if the original report was about the infrastructure). Selected reports are also published in the bimonthly CIRAS newsletter which can be found on the website: www.ciras.org.uk  Significance  CIRAS is recognized as creating one of the safety industries taxonomies to classify human error and accidents.Wallace,B, and Alastair Ross. Beyond Human Error: Taxonomies and Safety Science; (CRC Press 2006).

The reconstruction of the structural parts of the cathedral was completed in 2007. The new altar, lectern, and crucifix were made of silvered bronze and Sicilian jasper by the Italian sculptor, Giuseppe Ducrot. The frescos in the cupola and pendentives by the Russian painter, Oleg Supereco, were also illustrated, as well as the eight new windows in the cupola by Francesco Mori. =Feast of San Corrado 2011= On 19 February 2011 in Noto Cathedral, Saint Corrado Confalonieri, patron saint of the city and diocese of Noto, was celebrated in front of millions of the faithful in commemoration of his death. His relics are contained in a silver urn supported by four griffins, bearing on its summit a figure of the Risen Christ, which is carried in an ark carried on the shoulders of members of the Ancient Brotherhood, wearing white shirts. Very characteristic is the return of the silver urn to the cathedral, where the bearers climb the steps to the sounds of the church bells and of the faithful chanting \\"Nuticiani chi semu muti? Viva San Corrado!\\" (\\"People of Noto, are we mute? Long live Saint Corrado!\\").

Interior of Old Eagle School as it appeared circa 1909 Exterior of Old Eagle School as it appeared circa 1909 The Old Eagle School is located near Strafford Station on the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Tredyffrin Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Description The building is a one-story stone structure with three windows on each side and two windows on the end. Inscribed on the southern end of the building is the date \\"1788\\". Adjacent to the school is a graveyard which includes the remains of early settlers and participants in the American Revolution. History On 16 March, 1765 Jacob Giradin purchased of land north of the site of the present day Strafford Station. Shortly thereafter a log cabin church was built near the site of the present day school building. In 1788 the Old Eagle School House was built, and the church was demolished circa 1805. The original building was a stone one-room structure with several large windows, devoid of glass approximately half the size of the current structure. The building was at first heated by an open wood fire, later replaced with a wood-burning stove. Students sat on wooden slab benches arranged in double rows around the edges of the building, and the master sat in the center near the fireplace. The building was used for community purposes, such as political and religious meetings as well as education. The building was expanded in 1835 to the present size. Heavy use took a toll on the structure such that in 1842 it was said to be in \\"ruinous condition\\" A new building was erected about a quarter mile west and the current building fell into disuse aside from occasional Sunday religious services. In 1845 some parishioners from St. David's Church in nearby Radnor, Pennsylvania proposed instituting Episcopal services in the building but were rebuffed by Baptists who claimed prior rights to the site. Reference to the property's deed mentioned that the property was to be devoted to the use by all denominations and the Episcopalians were permitted to hold their services and start a Sunday school. In 1874 the public school board surrendered use of the building in favor of a newer school built at Pechin's Corner to the northwest. Following a number of years of dispute over the use and disposition of the property, on 6 May 1895 a board of trustees were appointed to oversee and renovate the property which had once again fallen into a state of decay. Current The Old Eagle School is currently overseen by a board of trustees responsible for the upkeep of the building and grounds. They are open free of charge to the public on Sundays from 2:00 to 4:00 pm during the summer. Private tours may be arranged to groups of interested people. The upkeep for the property comes from private donations of time and money. 2014 Board of Trustees: Jeffrey T.

Fried and fatty foods, strong cheeses, whole grains (rich in fiber), and the medications aspirin and ibuprofen are also avoided while on this diet. Such a diet is called bland because it is soothing to the digestive tract (it minimizes irritation of tissues). It can also be bland in the sense of \\"lacking flavor\\", but it does not always have to be so; nonirritating food can be appetizing food, depending on preparation and individual preferences. Uses Bland diets are often recommended following stomach or intestinal surgery, or for people with ulcers, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gas. A bland diet allows the digestive tract to heal before introducing more difficult to digest foods. Many milk and dairy products are permissible, even recommended, on a bland diet, but there are a few exceptions. Chocolate-flavored dairy products are discouraged, as well as any strongly spiced cheeses or high fat dairy products such as heavy cream or half-and-half. Mild dairy foods tend to soothe irritated linings, but excessive fats, cocoa and spices can have the opposite effect. Most canned fruits and vegetables are fine, with the exception of tomatoes. Tomato-based sauces on pasta are avoided. Bananas are good; however, higher fiber and acidic fruits should be avoided. Baked potatoes and sweet potatoes are very easily digested, but it is important to avoid high fat toppings like butter. Vinegar based foods such as pickles are to be avoided as are sour fermented foods like sauerkraut. Perhaps, the most difficult adjustment for some to a bland diet may involve meats and proteins. In a strict bland food diet, softer protein sources such as smooth peanut butter, eggs and tofu are encouraged over any type of fibrous or seasoned meat. Certain meats such as poultry or fish are permitted, as long as they are not heavily fried, breaded or processed like sandwich meats. Steamed poultry breast served with a salt substitute would be a typical protein serving while on a bland diet. A bland diet is designed primarily to help patients recover from gastrointestinal conditions or other medical circumstances in which improved digestion would be essential. It is not especially effective as a long-term weight loss diet, although portion sizes are strictly controlled. Many people find a bland diet to be very difficult to maintain, although some find the use of acceptable spice alternatives does make it easier. Most patients slowly return to a more normal diet once their medical issues have been resolved.

In 1994, a college affiliated with the Rani Durgavati University in Jabalpur was opened on the same campus. The school has strong ties with the Sikh community. Though the school has no religious affiliations to Sikhism, it promotes the cultural activities that are often the hallmark of Sikhism. Such activities include the birthday celebration of Guru Nanak Dev on November 19 every year and related processions in the city. History After independence, the GGSKHSS school was erected besides Marhatal Gurudwara wherein Hindi and English medium education was given in morning and day shift respectively and then in 80's, it was shifted to an old British era bungalow near 4th bridge with the original architecture of the building intact. Interested students participates in the Jaloos [procession on Guru Nanak Devji's and Guru Gobind Singhji's Birthdays].

Now the school has morning classes and turns into a college in the afternoon. The educational syllabus of the school is based upon the syllabus prescribed by the state Madhya Pradesh Board of Secondary Education and the medium of instruction is English. As with many other schools in the region, GGSKHSS follows the concept of the 'third language', the first two being English (the medium of instruction) and Hindi (the national language of India).

It is based on Memoirs of a British Agent, the 1932 autobiography of R. H. Bruce Lockhart, who worked for the British Secret Service during the Russian Revolution and had an affair with a Russian agent, later known as Moura Budberg. The film was produced by First National, then a division of Warner Bros. Production At one point, the studio considered the possibility of shooting some scenes on location in the Soviet Union, but the political situation there made that impossible. Instead, the film was shot at the studio in Hollywood, with sets designed by the art director Anton Grot. The comparatively-large budget of $475,000 allower 41 different sets to be used to recreate Imperial Russia and the early years of the Revolution. The same book was partly used as an inspiration for the television series Reilly, Ace of Spies, which also portrayed the adventures of Lockhart and Sidney Reilly during their years in Moscow around the time of the Russian Revolution. Plot In the days leading up to the Russian Revolution, Stephen Locke (Leslie Howard), a minor British diplomat, watches rioting in the streets. The revolutionary Elena Moura (Kay Francis) shoots it out with a Cossack soldier. When she retreats onto the grounds of the consulate, the soldier follows, forcing Stephen to intervene to protect British extraterritoriality. After the Cossack leaves, Elena emerges; she and Steven are attracted to each other, but their politics clash. Elena departs. After the Russian Empire is overthrown and the Soviet Union is born, most Western diplomats evacuate. Stephen is left behind with just a servant, \\"Poohbah\\" Evans. Day after day, he waits with mounting frustration for instructions, passing the time with others in the same situation, the American Bob Medill (William Gargan), Gaston LeFarge (Phillip Reed) and Tito Del Val (Cesar Romero). His boredom is lifted when he meets Elena again. She is now an important member of the government, working for Commissioner of War Leo Trotsky (J. Carrol Naish). He romances her, and they quickly fall in love. However, her first loyalty is to her country. She demonstrates that when Stephen finally receives orders from England. He is to try to prevent Soviet Russia from concluding a separate peace with Imperial Germany, which would free up large numbers of German soldiers for the Western Front, but he is warned that he is only an \\"unofficial\\" British representative. Stephen carelessly reads the message in Elena's hearing. She passes along the information to her boss. As a result, when Stephen pleads with the Soviet government in Moscow to keep fighting, his arguments are undercut by their awareness of his status. He manages to get a delay of three weeks to see if he can persuade his superiors to agree to Soviet demands: ¬£50 million, five army divisions and munitions. Instead, without Stephen's knowledge, the British send a force to Archangel to fight alongside the internal enemies of the Soviets. After the Tsar is executed, Medill, LeFarge and Del Val persuade Stephen to join them in supporting counterrevolutionary forces. When Vladimir Lenin is seriously wounded in an assassination attempt, the Soviets initiate a harsh crackdown. LeFarge and Del Val are killed while they attempt to contact a rebel military leader in the city. Medill tries to do the same, but is caught and tortured for Stephen's whereabouts. When he refuses to crack, he is sentenced to die by firing squad the next day. Elena is ordered to persuade him to tell her where Stephen is; knowing that she is in love with Stephen, Medill gives her the address. She reluctantly gives the information to Trotsky, who orders soldiers to level the building. Elena sneaks into the building, as she is determined to die with Stephen. They are reprieved, however. Just as the soldiers start shooting, news arrives that Lenin will recover and that he has ordered the release of all political prisoners. Later, Stephen and Elena depart for England. At the train station, Medill requests they send him a supply of bubble gum.

Rice production in Guyana reached a high of over 180,000 tons in 1984 but declined to a low of 130,000 tons in 1988. The fluctuating production levels were the result of disease and inconsistent weather. Droughts and heavy rains had an adverse effect on rice crops because the irrigation and drainage systems in rice-growing areas were poorly maintained. The area under rice cultivation fell from 100,000 hectares in 1964 to 36,000 hectares in 1988, according to the Guyana Rice Producers' Association. The Guyana Rice Development Board is also an important institution in the development of rice production in Guyana. Most rice farms in Guyana were privately owned; the government operated the irrigation systems and rice-processing mills, with the notable exception of Kayman Sankar, whose plantations at Hamptoncourtpolder (on Essequibo's Atlantic coast) included milling, shelling, grading, drying, and storage facilities. This division of the industry resulted in several difficulties. According to the United States Embassy, the government neglected irrigation and drainage canals because private farmers refused to pay taxes for their maintenance. Meanwhile, the government-run mills were reportedly slow in paying farmers for their crops. In addition, the government-controlled distribution system for tractors, fuel, spare parts, and fertilizer was highly inefficient, according to some reports. In 1990 the government began privatizing the rice industry by putting several rice mills up for sale. The bulk of Guyana's rice production was consumed domestically. Even so, exports took on increasing importance during the 1980s as a source of foreign exchange; there were even reports of rice being smuggled out of the country. Guyana shared a quota for rice exports to the EEC with neighboring Suriname but was unable to fill the quota during the late 1980s. In 1988 the government set a 1991 production goal of 240,000 tons and an export goal of 100,000 tons. In the first quarter of 1990, however, exports fell to a record low of 16,000 tons, for an annual rate of less than 70,000 tons. Half of these exports came directly from private farmers, the other half from the Guyana Rice Milling and Marketing. The annual rice production target for 2013 is 412,000 tonnes. Venezuela is the largest importer of Guyana‚Äôs rice. Rice is also exported to Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago, and to Europe. Reports in October 2013Nadine Sanchara 'Rice harvest on track', Guyana Chronicle Online, 13 October 2013. Retrieved 2013-10-14. indicate that this will be exceeded despite a very wet August and a high infestation of paddy bugs which had caused some damage to the first crop. Dr. Leslie Ramsammy, the Minister of Agriculture has indicated that the local rice industry will surpass the 500,000-tonne mark and Mr. Dharamkumar Seeraj. the General Secretary of the RPA, is reported as saying that the weather conditions were ideal for harvesting and as such, the rice harvest was proceeding smoothly in all rice producing areas of Guyana.

KAIROS is a landscape of possibilities in deep migration, with images filmed through the Louvre's high-resolution microscope from elements related to an enigmatic Mesopotamian figure. They are an avalanche of the possible, microcosm and immense in space, from the center of what we don't know to the implications of imagination. Slowly unraveling beyond descriptive, they reach to an almost undulating, disequilibrating atomic level, in deep color. The unraveling images are an excavation through borders, an essential comment on location of perspective. The microscope functions as an invisible facilitator. Ms. Kleinberg's work has been shown at five Venice Biennales: In 1995,http://www.susankleinberg.com/sposaliziodelmar.html 2001,http://www.artszin.net/vol2/venice.html 2011,http://www.museiciviciveneziani.it/frame.asp?pid=2053&musid;=244&sezione;=mostre 2015http://fortuny.visitmuve.it/en/mostre-en/archivio-mostre-en/tra-edge-of- becoming-1/2011/06/6466/tickets-51/ and 2017;http://fortuny.visitmuve.it/en/mostre-en/archivio-mostre-en/intuition- exhibition/2017/04/17284/intuition-fortuny/ as well as during the 2005 Venice Biennale,http://www.comune.venezia.it/flex/FixedPages/IT/Eventi.php/L/IT/P/9/ADV/-1/ID/-1/frmHaveData/-/frmSearchInfo/-/YY/05/MM/06/DD/10/IDC/4/UT/systemPrint sponsored by the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti; the 2009 Biennale, sponsored by Telecom Italia;http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11‚à´_new=31228‚à´_modo=1 and the 2013 Biennale.

BLOOD ROLL was shown first in November 2004 in Seoul, Korea, in a major international show at the Total Museum of Contemporary Art, curated by Young Chul Lee, commissioner of the previous Gwangju Biennale. Kleinberg installed P-SPIN at the Pulkovo Observatory in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2007,http://www.proarte.ru/ru/programm/festival/07pulkarteng in an exhibition organized by Olesya Turkina, a curator from the State Russian Museum. In these last four digital projections, a large glass globe seesaws tensely back and forth over a central fulcrum. The movements are both with and against any predictable laws of physics or nature. The globe rolls upwards, almost off the edge, catches, spins back, spins forward faster, spirals, hesitates, continues ‚Ä¶ the shadow, density, and reflection, contort and contract, shifting continually. The pieces speak to equilibrium/disequilibrium, of many systems, be they economic, political, environmental, institutional, physical or emotional. The pieces are led by deep reverberating sound tracks. In 2003, Ms. Kleinberg mounted What Would Make for a Better World, a video installation for the ‚ÄúFuture Democracy‚Äù exhibition at the Istanbul Biennial.http://www.sanathaber.net/haber.asp?HaberID=1887&KategoriAdi;=Resim- Gorsel In this piece she spoke with and photographed the least visible in society about what would make for a better world. The still photographs are joined to the moving sound on DVD, installed throughout the gallery space on monitors mounted on the walls. Hanging from the ceiling were painted Chinese fans with the photographs of the people in the piece embedded into them. In 2001, she created Fear Not for the Venice Biennale, curated by Harald Szeemann. Fear Not was a video installation based around audio interviews about courage, which she did with people from every walk of life; from artist Chuck Close and President Bill Clinton to Gore Vidal, Albanian refugees, Spalding Gray, film director Sidney Lumet, domestic workers, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, Evelyn Lauder; as well as interviews in Italian with a similar spectrum of people, from former President Silvio Berlusconi and Susanna Agnelli to fish sellers in the Venetian market. Following the interviews, Ms. Kleinberg photographed, or chose photographs of each of the individuals. These were linked to the audio track and installed on monitors, almost as Renaissance portraits, throughout the Arsenale.http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/venues/arsenale/ There have been numerous exhibitions of Fear Not. It was shown in New York at P.S. 1/MOMAhttps://www.moma.org/about_moma/press/2001/PS1_Sched_10_01.html (2001‚Äì2002). Most recently it was part of an international exhibition on the subject of courage at the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin. It was chosen as a Special Project for the Chicago International Art Fairhttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_5_90/ai_86194952 (2002), was exhibited at the Neuhoff Gallery in New York (May 2002). Ms. Kleinberg showed related paintings and drawings at Venice Design Gallery, Venice, Italy (2001) and a preview installation at the Stark Gallery in New York (2001). In 2002 the piece was shown along with related prints at the Tasende Galleryhttp://www.tasendegallery.com/past.html in Los Angeles and the Tasende Gallery in La Jolla, CA; as well as at a benefit and lecture for the Skirball Museum in Los Angeles. In 2002, Ms. Kleinberg showed at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Arteshttp://universes-in- universe.de/america/arg/txt/s-jornadas-2002.htm in Buenos Aires, for the Biennale of Buenos Aires and delivered one of the opening lectures. Kleinberg prepared the Italian version of Fear Not for the 2001 Venice Biennale at the American Academy in Rome, where she was Visiting Artist in Residence; and where six years earlier she prepared her \\"Sposalizio del Mar\\" installation for the 1995 Venice Biennale. \\"Sposalizio del Mar\\", whose reference is to the most important ceremony of the Venetian Republic, the Sposalizio Del Mar: the marriage of the Doge to the sea, floated in the Grand Canal between San Marco and San Giorgio. It was a bright yellow ring, based on the Apollo space capsule's flotation collar, filled with the golden detritus of Venetian history to the present. An audio tape of people talking about living in relation to the sea accompanied it. The piece was ultimately sold to the Province of Lake Como. The beginnings of all of this work were shown at the Castelli Gallery in New York. In 1994, she installed a permanent piece in the board room of Human Rights Watch's International Headquarters in New York. Ms. Kleinberg traveled to Aurangabad, India in the spring of 1992 at the invitation of the Sarabai family, who have invited artists for many years to live and work there for extended periods of time.

It is the city's largest square and one of the largest (and, prior to almost all its buildings being destroyed in bombing in the Second World War, the most beautiful) squares in Europe. It is also part of the city's inner-city ring-road and a central hub for its tram network. History The history of today's square began in 1785 on a site within the city walls as the Platz vor dem Grimmaischen Tor to designs by the city architect Johann Carl Friedrich Dauthe. It was renamed Augustusplatz in 1839 after Frederick Augustus, the first king of Saxony. In 1928 the social- democratic city government renamed it Karl-Marx-Platz, though this name proved unpopular and was ignored even in newspaper articles and town plans. In 1933 the Nazis renamed it Augustusplatz, then in 1953 it became Karl-Marx-Platz again, and finally in 1990 (on the day of German reunification) it returned to its current name of Augustusplatz. It is now dominated by the Opernhaus on its northern edge, the Neues Gewandhaus (with the Mendebrunnen) on southern side, and the main buildings of the University of Leipzig, including the City- Hochhaus Leipzig on the western side bordering the city centre. Destruction during the Second World War and the radical city-planning policies of the GDR both mean the Augustusplatz has lost its historical appearance: the now closed Hauptpost, the newly built Radisson SAS Hotel (former names: Hotel Mercure, Interhotel am Ring, Hotel Deutschland) and the university complex are all built mainly of concrete and steel in the style of the 1960s or later. In May 1968, for example, the bomb-damaged Augusteum and the university church that had suffered little damage (Paulinerkirche) were both dynamited. From 4 September 1989 to 1990, Monday demonstrations took place. From 1996 to 1998 an underground car park was built under the Augustusplatz with many entrances and ventilation shafts leading on to the square, the construction of which proved controversial. The carpark's eight illuminated glass cylinders housing the stairwells have been mocked in particular, being nicknamed \\"Milcht√∂pfe\\" or milk-bottles. The construction of the university's new main building or Paulinum involved a fierce controversy over the possible reconstruction of the university church between 2002 and 2004 . Although completion of the complex was hoped for in 2009 for the university's 600th anniversary, the university now expects it to be reached in 2013. With its auditorium and the gabled roof it recalls the style of the former Augusteum and the demolished church. The Augustusplatz was mostly redesigned to plans by the architect Erick van Egeraat.

This area differs from social cognition and person perception by being interpersonal rather than intrapersonal, and thus requiring the interaction of at least two actual people. There are three stages of the perception process including selection, organization, and interpretation.  Phenomena studied  *accuracy ‚Äì the correctness of A's beliefs about B *self-other agreement ‚Äì whether A's beliefs about B matches B's beliefs about themself *similarity ‚Äì whether A's and B's beliefs match *projection/assumed similarity ‚Äì whether A's beliefs about B match A's beliefs about themself *reciprocity ‚Äì the similarity of A's and B's beliefs about each other *meta-accuracy ‚Äì whether A knows how others see them *assumed projection ‚Äì whether A thinks others see them as they see them These variables cannot be assessed in studies that ask people to form beliefs about fictitious targets.

The sparsity of research, in particular on the accuracy of first-impressions, means that social psychologists know a lot about what people think about others, but far less about whether they are right. Many attribute this to a criticism that Lee Cronbach wrote in 1955 about how impression accuracy was calculated,Cronbach, L. J. (1955). Processes affecting scores on \\"understanding of others\\" and \\"assumed similarity.\\" Psychological Bulletin, 52, 177-193. which resulted in a 30-year hiatus in research. During that time, psychologists focused on consensus (whether A and B agree in their beliefs about C) rather than accuracy, although Kenny has argued that consensus is neither necessary nor sufficient for accuracy.Kenny, D.A.

On the accuracy of personality judgment: A realistic approach.

People more accurately perceive extraversion and conscientiousness in strangers than they do the other personality domains.Watson, D. (1989). Strangers' ratings of the five robust personality factors: Evidence of a surprising convergence with self-report. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 57, 120-128. A 5-second interaction tells you as much as 15 minutes on these domains,Ambady, N., & Rosenthal, R. (1992).

Viewing peoples' personal websites or \\"online profiles\\" (as on MySpace, Facebook, or a dating website) can make people as knowledgeable about their conscientiousness and open-mindedness as their long-term friends.

It seems to have become popular at the end of the tenth and during the ninth century BCE during the early Iron Age in northern Syria although it may have originated as early as the Bronze Age. Contemporary records call it a Hittite-style palace, probably after the Neo- Hittite kingdoms of northern Syria. This building type has also spread to the Southern Levant, where it has been widely used. Description The major feature for a visitor would have been the monumental entrance loggia or portico with columnsPeter M. M. G. Akkermans, Glenn M. Schwartz, The Archaeology of Syria: From Complex Hunter-gatherers to Early Urban Societies (c. 16,000-300 BC), Cambridge University Press, 2003, , , pages 368-370 flanked by large massive parts of the building and approached by a broad but relative low flight of steps. On one side a stairway to the upper parts would reside in one of these block like structures.Historical dictionary of the Hittites by Charles Allen Burney, Scarecrow Press, 2004, page 41-2 (google books link) Straight ahead one would enter the great hall, where one would have to turn by 90¬∞ to see the throne in the far end of the hall. The overall plan of the building would be rectangular with the large hall in the middle surrounded on all sides by the other much narrower rooms.Comparable plans of the hilani type buildings at the top on page 146 (fig.1 \\"\\"Tell Ta'yinat\\", \\"Tell Halaf\\", \\"Zinjirli\\" and \\"Sakje Guezi\\") in Podium Structures with Lateral Access by Ilan Sharon and Anabel Zarzecki-Peleg in \\"Confronting the Past: Archaeological and Historical Essays on Ancient Israel in Honor of William G. Dever\\", 2006, , Origin and architectural legacy This type of design with a large central space surrounded by a double wall with smaller rooms taking up the space within the walls may be based on designs first used in the late Ubaid period in southern Mesopotamia such as the Ubaid house. Pillared porticos as gates or grand entrances were used by several cultures of the Bronze Age around the eastern Mediterranean sea. The examples of the Hittites and the Myceneans may be the best known. Through the megarons and propylaea of the mycenaean palaces the style may have lived into classical Greek designs. The iron age hilani of the Levant, may well be the combination of the old broad-room concept with a Hittite-style portico. In recent traditional architecture it may have a late resemblance in the design of the liwan house.

The palace is thought to have been built by Niqmepa, a son of Idrimi of the royal family of the Amorite state of Yamhad based in Halab. A building at the citadel (B√ºy√ºkkale) of the Hittite capital Hattusa may also have been of the hilani type.The detached building (labelled as building E on most plans) lies near the north-west corner of the palace area of the citadel, between the large reception hall and the more private building in the northernmost corner of the citadel. It does not seem to have been incorporated in the court systems and may thus have served as a more private reception building. During excavations an archive was found within the building. The plan of the building seems rather symmetrical and is more similar to those unearthed in Sam'al and Carchemish than for example the palace of Kapara at Guzana. See also this map of the acropolis of Hattusa with a detailed description of the buildings and areas. As most of the structures on the citadel underwent considerable rebuilding during the reign of Tudhaliya IV (c. 1237‚Äì1209 BCE), it is usually dated to the 13th century BCE.See the paragraph [http://www.hattuscha.de/English/cityhistory2.htm \\"V.

Friedkin flew to Japan and convinced Toyota that he had the necessary knowledge and resources. Gulf States Toyota brought the first Toyota vehicle to Houston, Texas in 1969, when all Toyota vehicles were manufactured in Japan and imported into the US. Three years later, the company employed 35 associates and had sold 5,000 cars and trucks through 14 dealerships. GST also completed construction of a processing center on a site at the Port of Houston. In 1979, GST won the Import Vehicle Triple Crown by being first in import car, truck and combined import sales in the United States with 65,826 vehicles sold. The NUMMI plant, a joint venture with General Motors, opened at Fremont, California in 1984 and was Toyota's first assembly plant in the US. Gulf States Toyota completed construction and opened its Parts Distribution Center (PDC) near Sealy, Texas in 1986. Today, the PDC provides dedicated parts delivery to over 150 dealers, shipping nearly 100% of all orders every day. By 1994, GST had exceeded 100,000 in total vehicle sales and outgrown its processing center at the port. GST opened its Vehicle Processing Center on Houston's Northside, built to handle 150,000 vehicles a year. The facility is served by rail and transport trucks and employs over 600 associates. With vehicle sales steadily increasing, GST outsold Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (Torrance, CA) in import car market share in 1998. With record sales in 2000, GST processed 11% of all Toyotas sold in the United States. In 2003, GST helped name Houston's premier sports and entertainment venue‚Äîthe Toyota Center. Toyota broke ground on its truck plant in nearby San Antonio, Texas. The plant, which produces the full-size Tundra pickup, represents a $1.58 billion investment in the community. At year's end, GST exceeded 149,000 total vehicles sold. In 2005, Gulf States Toyota was named the #1 privately held company in Houston by the Houston Chronicle's Chronicle 100 list. GST was also listed at #40 on Forbes' list of America's Largest Private Companies. By the end of the year, more than 185,000 vehicles were sold through 145 dealerships. In the production of Toyota's manufacturing GST made a simplistic production reporting tool which increased Toyota's overall output.

Biography  The parents of Jean- Rodolphe Kars were both Viennese Jews who had fled Austria after the Anschluss in 1938. They met in Calcutta, India, where Gustav Kars (himself born in 1913 in Shanghai) met Mila, a qualified doctor (who had volunteered to work in a Red Cross hospital after being widowed in New Zealand). Jean-Rodolphe - Gustav's first child and Mila's second - was born in 1947. Deciding that Europe would offer their children the possibility of a superior education, the Kars family left India for France. They lived for some years in a small town in the Haute Loire, but eventually settled in Paris where Gustav found employment in a private Jewish school. The family's circumstances were quite modest, but Jean-Rodolphe's musical ability was obvious; he gained entrance to the Paris Conservatoire, where he studied from 1958-64. He also studied with Julius Katchen. From 1974, Jean-Rodolphe Kars studied with the French pianist and pedagogue Jean Fassina, the most important and inspiring teaching, according to Kars, in his musical formation. At the age of 19 Jean-Rodolphe Kars took part in the second Leeds Piano Competition (1966). In somewhat controversial circumstances, Kars received the fourth prize, with the first prize going to the Spaniard Rafael Orozco, the second being awarded jointly to the Russians Viktoria Postnikova and Semion Kruchin, and the third to the Russian Aleksey Nasedkin. Kars' London debut was in 1967; in 1968 he was awarded first prize in the Olivier Messiaen piano competition. During this time the Kars family lived in a working-class area of Paris called quartier Al√©sia, in an apartment so cramped that the piano and a tiny bath installation (isolated by a curtain) had to be kept in the same room. In 1971 he partook in a well received tour of Southern Africa.Jean-Rudolphe Kars 1971, touring Southern Africa Kars' upbringing had been that of a secular Jew; in 1976, however, he converted to Catholicism and was baptised in Basilique du Sacr√©- C≈ìur, Paris, in 1977. In 1980, he joined a Catholic association of the faithful (the Emmanuel Community). In 1981 he ended his official career as concert pianist. In 1986 he entered the priesthood, becoming P√®re Jean- Rodolphe Kars. Since 1986 he has been Chaplain of Paray-le-Monial, a town in the Burgundy region of France. Although he possessed a varied and eclectic repertoire, ranging from Bach to Sch√∂nberg, Jean-Rodolphe then specialized in the works of Olivier Messiaen. Later, as a priest, he also lectured and wrote articles on the spiritual and theological aspects of the music of the great French composer. Having begun to study Messiaen's music and writings as long ago as 1966, Kars credits him with playing an important role in his eventual conversion to Catholicism and his vocation as a priest, and considers him his 'first spiritual father'.

Synopsis In the first fourteen episodes, from September to January, Bridges played the author Adam Shepherd who was transformed into the main character of each episode. In January, the program, considered in retrospect to have been highly innovative, became a straightforward anthology with Bridges hosting each episode, much as Ronald Reagan had done with the General Electric Theater and Jane Wyman had prevailed with Jane Wyman Presents. The program featured Bridges's sons, Jeff and Beau Bridges, in occasional guest-starring roles.Alex McNeil, Total Television, New York: Penguin Books, 1996, 4th ed., p. 487 The premiere episode is entitled \\"Wheresoever I Enter\\". \\"A Pair of Boots\\" casts Bridges as a Confederate whose truce with the Union Army is threatened by a southern soldier's desire to reclaim a pair of shoes stolen by a northerner. Co-stars in the episode are son Beau Bridges. Royal Dano, and Seymour Cassel. In the episode \\"My Daddy Can Beat Your Daddy\\", authored by Robert Towne, the screenwriter of Chinatown, Bridges plays an aging boxer fighting a match against his own son. Co-stars in the segment are son Jeff Bridges, Gary Lockwood, and Mary Murphy. Broadcast history The Lloyd Bridges Show, a Four Star production, aired on Tuesday at 8 p.m. Eastern time; summer rebroadcasts aired from June to September 3, 1963. The series aired opposite the first season of ABC's military drama Combat!, starring Rick Jason and Vic Morrow, and the last season of NBC's western series Laramie starring John Smith, Robert Fuller, and Spring Byington.

From 1934 to 1945, he was director of the physics department at the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe. Education From 1919 to 1925, B√ºhl studied physics at the Friedrich- Wilhelms-Universit√§t (today, the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin) and the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg. He received his doctorate in 1925 under the Nobel Laureate Philipp Lenard at Heidelberg and was a teaching assistant to Lenard.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for B√ºhl. Career In 1928, B√ºhl became a teaching assistant at the Albert-Ludwigs- Universit√§t Freiburg and from 1929 was a Privatdozent there in physics. From 1931 to 1933, he had a lectureship in the physics department at the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule Z√ºrich. In 1934, he replaced Wolfgang Gaede as director of the physics department at the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe (today, the Universit√§t Karlsruhe); Gaede had been forced out by the National Socialist regime as ‚Äúpolitically unreliable‚Äù after he accepted the Duddell Medal of the London Physical Society in 1933. In 1936, B√ºhl was an untenured ausserordentlicher Professor and from 1937 to 1945 an ordentlicher Professor at the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 341n13. B√ºhl was a physics advisor to the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League). In 1940, B√ºhl attended the historic meeting known as the M√ºnchner Religionsgespr√§che confronting the Deutsche Physik movement; B√ºhl was a principal there supporting the movement.Beyerchen, 1977, 177 ‚Äì 179. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, the concept of Deutsche Physik took on more favor and fervor. Deutsche Physik was anti- Semitic and anti-theoretical physics, especially including modern physics, i.e., quantum mechanics. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability, even though its two most prominent supporters were Nobel Laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark. During the period in which Deutsche Physik was gaining prominence, a foremost concern of the great majority of scientists was to maintain autonomy against political encroachment. Some of the more established scientists, such as Max von Laue, could demonstrate more autonomy than the younger and less established scientists. This was, in part, due to political organizations, such as the NSDDB, whose district leaders had a decisive role in the acceptance of an Habilitationsschrift, which was a prerequisite to attaining the rank of Privatdozent necessary to becoming a university lecturer. While some with ability joined such organizations out of tactical career considerations, others with ability and adherence to historical academic standards joined these organizations to moderate their activities. This was the case of Wolfgang Finkelnburg. It was in the summer of 1940 that Finkelnburg became an acting director of the NSDDB at Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. As such, he organized the M√ºnchner Religionsgespr√§che, which took place on 15 November 1940 and was known as the ‚ÄúMunich Synod.‚Äù The M√ºnchner Religionsgespr√§che was an offensive against Deutsche Physik. Finkelnburg invited five representatives to make arguments for theoretical physics and academic decisions based on ability rather than politics: Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, Otto Scherzer, Georg Joos, Otto Heckmann, and Hans Kopfermann. Alfons B√ºhl, a supporter of Deutsche Physik, invited Harald Volkmann, Bruno Th√ºring, Wilhelm M√ºller, Rudolf Tomaschek, and Ludwig Wesch.

It centers on the ill-fated love story between a Viennese ex-con and a Ukrainian prostitute who get involved in a bank robbery. The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2008. It received critical acclaim and won a number of awards, and was nominated for the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Plot Alex, an ex- convict living in Vienna and working as muscle at a brothel, starts a relationship with Tamara, a Ukrainian prostitute who works there. Alex plans to rob a bank in a small village, then hide out with his grandfather Hausner, who lives there, before leaving with Tamara to start a new life together. He lets an anxious and clingy Tamara accompany him on the robbery. They have a run-in with a local policeman named Robert outside the bank, and Tamara is accidentally killed when Robert fires at their fleeing car. A despondent Alex escapes and hides out at Hausner's farm as planned. Robert's marriage to his wife Susanne is strained, as he is apparently unable to conceive a child, and his repressed guilt over the shooting worsens this strain. They happen to be neighbors to Hausner, with whom Susanne is good friends, and she encounters Alex while visiting him. Alex learns Susanne's husband was the shooter, and begins stalking Robert with a loaded gun. An oblivious Susanne propositions Alex during a visit to the farm, and the two commence an affair. Robert suffers a panic attack at work and is put on suspension, finally opening up to Susanne about his guilt over the shooting and general self-loathing. Alex confronts Robert in the woods, questioning him about the shooting in veiled terms. Robert admits his regret, but also chastises the robber (in third person) for needlessly bringing Tamara along, suggesting he has caught on to Alex's identity. Alex throws his gun in the pond. As Hausner's health deteriorates, Alex resolves to stay at the farm and look after it in his stead. Susanne successfully gets pregnant by Alex, passing it off as Robert's child. She visits Alex to cut off their affair and recognizes a photo of Tamara, realizing Alex was the robber. Alex agrees to keep their tryst a secret, and expresses no further intention of harming Robert as he returns to work on the farm.

They are responsible for the eastern Archdeaconry (the Archdeaconry of London) of the Two Cities (London and Westminster) in the Diocese of London, an area without area bishop and, rather, overseen by the (diocese- leading) Bishop of London. The immediate western counterpart in this area is the Archdeacon(ry) of Charing Cross. Since 1989, the churches of this supervisory cleric are the numerous remaining churches of the City of London. Those of the Archdeacon of Charing Cross are the relatively few churches, but much more heavily populated zone that is the City of Westminster. History Before the 20th century, the early medieval-founded London archdeaconry included parts of the East End as well as the City of London. The extent of the archdeaconry was reduced in 1912 (with the creation of the Archdeaconry of Hampstead) and in 1951 (with the creation of the Archdeaconry of Hackney) then latest border changes limited the archdeaconry to the limits of the City of London. =Archdeacons of Charing Cross= This archdeaconry, comprising the City of Westminster, was created shortly before Klyberg's appointment in 1989. The archdeacon serves directly under the Bishop of London, who takes direct responsibility for the Two Cities area since there is no area bishop.

The film stars Thomas Hunter in the heroic lead role, along with veteran American actors Henry Silva and Dan Duryea. Plot synopsis In the aftermath of the American Civil War, two rebel Texans are seen fleeing toward the Mexican border in a wagon, having made off with a huge sum of money stolen from the United States government. Just before reaching the safety of foreign soil they are intercepted by a U.S. army patrol. As the mounted soldiers close in, the men draw cards to decide who will stay on the wagon and draw the pursuit, and who will jump off with the loot and escape, keeping the other man's share safe until he can claim it. Ken Seagull (Nando Gazzolo) wins the draw, jumps off and successfully hides. Jerry Brewster (Thomas Hunter) crashes the wagon, is apprehended by the troopers, and is sent to a military prison. Five years later, Brewster is released and returns home to reunite with his wife and son. He finds his house deserted and in ruins, but discovers his wife's journal, which tells him that Seagull not only gave her no aid, but told her nothing of the money or the fact that her husband was alive. Maddened by the betrayal, the unarmed Brewster immediately finds himself under gunfire: Seagull has learned of his release and sent men to get him out of the way once and for all. Running into the barn for cover, Brewster finds a mysterious stranger (Dan Duryea) who throws him a weapon with which Brewster kills his attackers. His benefactor, who introduces himself as Winnie Getz, offers to tell Seagull that, while Brewster killed the hired gunmen, Getz himself finished their job and killed their target. The seemingly homeless Getz says he hopes to parlay that false intelligence into a steady job with Seagull. Getz goes on ahead, while Brewster (now using the name Jim Houston) follows on his quest for vengeance. Brewster soon learns that Seagull, now known as Ken Milton, has used his wealth to acquire a ranch and the services of vicious killer Garcia Mendez (Henry Silva), with whose help he has expanded his holdings by terrorizing other landowners. Brewster also learns that Seagull killed his wife, but finds his young son alive and living nearby as an orphan. The man called Houston gets a job with Mendez (while managing to stay out of sight of his employer \\"Milton\\") and, with Getz's help, proceeds to play a double game wherein he rides with Mendez and his killers, but secretly aids their intended victims. Eventually Brewster, with the help of his son and the surprisingly loyal Getz, confronts and kills Mendez and his men, and eventually Seagull. Afterward Getz reveals himself to be a government agent who had been on Seagull/Milton's trail all along. The government restores all property to its rightful owners, but Getz assures the authorities that the ex- convict Brewster was indeed murdered in the ambush at the empty house, freeing \\"Houston\\" to begin a new life with his son.

Reception From contemporary reviews, \\"Dool.\\" of Variety noted the film had the \\"well photographed outdoor action sequences\\" and that the score was \\"serviceable\\" and that the film had \\"enough action [...] to fill three pix, but [The Hills Run Red] carries on the European tradition of shooting up everyone in sight\\" and that the film had \\"limited boxoffice appeal.\\" A review in the Monthly Film Bulletin found the film to be \\"a rip-roaring variation on the revenge theme, wholly traditional in style but all gutsy action from start to finish.\\" The review went on to note that \\"even if the dialogue is clumsy and the hero's instinct for survival more than a little improbable, the action more than makes up for it.\\" From retrospective reviews, Alex Cox in his book 10,000 Ways to Die submits that the film was deliberately meant to evoke the Westerns of Anthony Mann.Cox, Alex 10,000 Ways to Die Oldcastle Books, 21 Oct 2010 References Sources  External links *The Hills Run Red at Dan Duryea Central * 1966 Western (genre) films 1966 films Italian films Spanish films Italian-language films Spaghetti Western films Films scored by Ennio Morricone Spanish Western (genre) films ","title":"The Hills Run Red (1966 film)"},{"id":"21210478","text":"Apodynerus is an indomalayan genus of potter wasps.

Historically it could be applied to the wider Austrian Empire, but since 1918, it has applied to the more limited boundaries of the modern nation-state of Austria. It was later sometimes taken as part of a wider Germanophile attitude and generally linked to the admiration of the Germanic culture of the German-speaking world or countries, mainly Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. History The term \\"austrophile\\" carried different meanings throughout history. The term was used to refer to 19th Century Austrian nationalist societies that were trying to resist the strong cultural influence that the German Empire carried in the Habsburg Monarchy. Additionally, the term was also used to describe citizens of the Austrian Empire who were not ethnically Austrian, but were strong supporters of the Austrian control over their native region. Similarly, during the War of the Spanish Succession, supporters of the House of Habsburg and its pretender to the throne, Archduke Charles, were known as Austrophiles. In Britain, during the 18th century, there were a number of prominent Austrophiles, including Prime Minister Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon- Tyne. Austrophiles sought an alliance with Austria against France. Opposed to the Francophiles, who saw French dominance in Europe as inevitable both culturally and militarily, they obtained the Anglo-Austrian Alliance. The movement led to British support for the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa during the Austrian War of Succession. They were opposed by the Austrophobes, who tried to draw attention to Austria's perceived autocracy and suppression of Protestant minorities.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. It had a magnitude of 0.9282 and was visible from a narrow corridor beginning in the south Atlantic Ocean and sweeping eastward 900 km south of Africa, slowly curving northeast through the Indian Ocean. Its first landfall was in the Cocos Islands followed by southern Sumatra and western Java. It continued somewhat more easterly across central Borneo, across the northwestern edge of Celebes, then ending just before Mindanao, Philippines. The duration of annularity at greatest eclipse lasted 7 minutes, 53.58 seconds, but at greatest duration lasted 7 minutes, 56.05 seconds. Occurring only 3.3 days after apogee (January 23, 2009), the Moon's apparent diameter was smaller.  Eclipse Season  This is the first eclipse this season.

For most of its life the cars were made by Malicet et Blin in France, but after World War I they were partially assembled (finished) in London and an increasing number of British parts used. History The first cars were probably supplied completely built by the French company Malicet et Blin, but over time the British content increased such that the final 2 litre car was made completely in England.Some sources cast doubt over whether complete cars were ever imported, or whether French components were assembled in a workshop in Notting Hill, London. () Malicet & Blin were established suppliers to the French automobile industry, including engines, gearboxes and chassis. In 1909 T.B. Andr√©, owner of Hartford Friction disk shock absorbers, took control of the dealership, and introduced a new range of larger cars with engines ranging in size between 2210 cc and 3617 cc. Although the company survived World War 1, they did not introduce a new model until 1922 when they used a British Anzani engine. This model was short-lived and was superseded by a French CIME powered car which continued in production until the company's demise in 1926. By 1924 T.B. Andre put his main sporting efforts into the Marlborough-Thomas which was built at Brooklands in partnership with J. G. Parry-Thomas. The cars In 1906 the first model was introduced in Britain, when C.C.C. of Taunton (Chassis Construction Company) exhibited at the London Agricultural Hall Motor Show. It was a 7 hp single-cylinder-engined car.Bridgwater Blake Museum, PDF, The Bridgwater Motor Car, pp5 In 1909 a new range of larger cars was introduced by T.B. Andr√© with engines ranging in size between 2210 cc and 3617 cc. The 12 hp model was priced at ¬£120 and had a 2.8-litre four-cylinder engine with the cylinders cast in pairs, magneto ignition, a cone clutch driving the 3-speed gearbox, with shaft drive to the rear wheels. The range included a 3.1-litre model with four cylinders, plus a 3.6-litre six-cylinder model which was priced at ¬£350. This range was marketed until 1911. In 1912 the company introduced one of the first cyclecars which was priced at ¬£185 and was mostly French built. It had a 1130 cc four-cylinder, water-cooled engine, a sharp V-shaped radiator and shaft drive to the rear wheels. Its sporting potential was demonstrated when it was driven in the Cyclecar Grand Prix by Sir Francis Samuelson. The electrically equipped version with a 1.2-litre engine was priced at ¬£275. This model was marketed again after World War I, although the specification also included rounded radiator, increased engine capacity (100cc) and four-speed gearbox. In 1921 the pre-war light car was replaced by a 1496 cc British Anzani engined model which was equipped with rod brakes and a flat radiator. This model was replaced one year later. The Roadspeed sports version was guaranteed to exceed 60 mph. In 1922 a smaller light car was launched with a French 1100 cc C.I.M.E. engine. By 1924 this was priced at ¬£175. This stayed in production until the company closed in 1926. The last model never reached customer production, but it was a British made sports car capable of 75 mph and fitted with four-wheel braking. It was equipped with a 2-litre, six-cylinder, overhead-valve Coventry Climax engine. T.B. Andr√© Theodore Bernard Andr√©, from Essex, took over the UK dealership in 1909.

Background Bred in England, he was out of the mare, Volley. His sire was Run the Gantlet, an American multiple Grade I winner and successful sire. He was purchased and raced by Ivan Allan, an owner and preeminent trainer in Asian horse racing for many years. He was trained at Bedford House Stables in Newmarket, Suffolk by Luca Cumani. Racing career Commanche Run made his racing debut on 13 October 1983 with second-place finish at Newmarket Racecourse. He next started at age three in May 1984 at York Racecourse, in the Dante Stakes a Group 2 race and major trial for the Derby finishing tenth. He then got his first win twelve days later on 28 May at Doncaster Racecourse. Moving up in company, the colt ran third in the 1984 King Edward VII Stakesat Royal Ascot and the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket‚Äôs July Meeting. Commanche Run then was aimed at the Gordon at Goodwood racecourse. Luca Cumani‚Äôs stable jockey Darrell McHargue was suspended and ridden positively close to the leaders Commanche Run took the lead three furlongs out and won very impressively from Shernazar. With McHargue back in the saddle he won the March Stakesalso at Goodwood. Shortly before the St.Leger at Doncaster McHargue was replaced by Piggott at the owner Ivan Allen‚Äôs instigation. The horse also suffered an injury scare in the days running up to the race Leading four furlongs from home he won by a neck from Baynoun with Alphabatim in third Under jockey Lester Piggott. At four Commanche Run went on to win two Group One races, capturing the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup, Irish Champion Stakes making three in total with the Classic St. Leger Stakes.He had also been a runaway winner of the Group 3 Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown Park on his first run of the year. He was then third in the Prince of Wales‚Äôs Stakes after a duel with the top class filly Pebbles which saw them beaten by an outsider Bob Back. Commanche Run was withdrawn before the start of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park in early July won by Pebbles and the injury he had sustained there prevented him from running in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes in late July. In the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York ridden from the front by Piggott he beat a top class field including the fillies Triple Crown winner Oh So Sharp and multiple Group 1 winning filly Triptych with Palace Music the winner of the previous year‚Äôs Champion Stakes and Bob Back well behind. Stud career Retired to stud duty at Coolmore Stud in Ireland, Commanche Run met with limited success. In 1999 he was transferred to Astley Grange Stud in Leicestershire where he died in March 2005. The sire of a number of steeplechase runners, he got fifteen stakes winners in all. His best flat racing runner was Lord Weinstock's colt Bonny Scot whose wins included the Great Voltigeur Stakes and the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood.

Arrowheads show the delineation of the lobe. Arrow points to the azygos vein. In human anatomy, an azygos lobe is a normal anatomical variation of the upper lobe of the right lung. It is seen in 1% of the population. Embryologically, it arises from an anomalous lateral course of the azygos vein in a pleural septum within the apical segment of the right upper lobe or in other words an azygos lobe is formed when the right posterior cardinal vein, one of the precursors of the azygos vein, fails to migrate over the apex of the lung and penetrates it instead, carrying along two pleural layers that invaginates into the upper portion of the right upper lobe . As it has no bronchi, veins and arteries of its own or corresponding alteration in the segmental architecture of the lung, so it is not a true (misnomer), or even accessory, pulmonary lobe, but rather an anatomically separated part of the upper lobe.

Gram means village and jivan means life in the Marathi language. This initiative was the dream of Mahatma Gandhi, and was created through the vision and efforts of Siddhagiri Gurukul Foundation. The history of self-sufficient village life in Maharshtra, before the invasion of the Mughals, is depicted in the form of cement sculptures. Each sculpture is lifelike and represents activities performed in daily village life. There were 12 Balutedars (essentially artisan castes), and 18 Alutedars who provided equipment to carry out domestic and professional tasks. The museum is spread over , and the surrounding countryside is beautiful, with lush greenery. Every aspect of village life has been depicted in almost 80 scenes that showcase more than 300 statues. Village scenes The scenes of village life include: * Village priest‚Äôs abode. The first scene is the house of a highly educated village priest. He performs his duties, rites and rituals like weddings and thread ceremonies, and is tasked to find auspicious days and times for any major activity such as house-building and house-warming activities, digging wells, sowing seeds, piercing nose or ears. He earns his livelihood from Dakshina (donations) he receives. He consults the Panchaang (almanac) for finding auspicious dates. * Goldsmith at work * Ironsmith shoeing a bullock * Barber shop * Village well - villagers fetching water from the public well. * Nursing an elder family member * Grocer‚Äôs shop - a woman visiting the grocery shop with her son.

Pandora and Effy Stonem are the only \\"Second generation\\" characters to appear in series two, and she is prominent throughout the third and fourth series. She is known for being the sexually naive and immature friend of Effy Stonem from very early on in the series, and later for her troubled relationship with her boyfriend, Thomas Tomone. Characterisation Pandora starts off the series as Effy's polar opposite - while Effy is crafty and mature, Pandora is very childish and sexually naive. Despite this, they make unlikely friends, after Pandora shows Effy a circus trick she learned. Pandora's childish playfulness and sexual naivety is most likely linked to the old-fashioned views of her mother, Angela, who goes to great lengths to protect her from the world in which she eventually becomes embroiled. Her name may be a reference to the inner satellite of Saturn. Pandora soon sheds her more childish side and matures after losing her virginity in her only centric episode. However, she then becomes involved in a troubled relationship with Thomas Tomone, a Congolese migrant new to the country, all the while living in the shadow of Effy, to whom she eventually stands up. Character history =Series 2= Pandora, unlike most of the other \\"Second Generation\\" cast, makes her first appearance in Series 2, in which she joins Effy Stonem at the same school as Abigail Stock. Her childish naivety initially repulses Effy, but she eventually becomes her friend after Pandora shows off a circus trick that she learned. She later accompanies Effy to various nightclubs and raves, mostly on her quest to solve the relationship issues between Tony, Michelle, Sid and Cassie. When buying some spliff from Cassie, Pandora sees Cassie kissing another girl and is noticeably shocked, presumably having never encountered homosexuality before. After smoking the weed for the first time, she gets high very easily. Throughout the entire episode, her mother Angela continually rings her, and their conversation suggests that Angela is somewhat overprotective of her. Effy, finally taking pity on Pandora, gives the art coursework Sid intended for her to Pandora, risking expulsion from the school. =Series 3= After joining Effy as a main character in the show, Pandora attends Roundview College. She is first seen within a swarm of blonde girls that take an interest in Katie Fitch's boyfriend Danny and immediately states that she is desperate to finally have sex (or \\"surf and turf\\") and lose her virginity. Later she walks out of her Hair & Beauty lesson (a course her mother forced her to take) and eventually finds and joins the Psychology class where she hopes to find Effy, who had just exited the lesson in order to have sex with Cook. In \\"Cook\\", Pandora throws up at Cook's birthday party, demonstrating low alcohol tolerance levels, but Cook insists on dragging them to a party not far away rather than allowing the girls to take her home. In \\"Thomas\\", Pandora and Effy meet Thomas Tomone, a newly arrived migrant from the Congo as he is busy gorging himself on some free doughnuts he obtained from the local newsagent. Thomas offers her some, but she eats too much and is violently sick. As Thomas carries her home with Effy, they discover Effy's mother, Anthea is having an affair with her husband's boss. The next day, Pandora comes across Thomas after a dance class and invites him to her aunt's home for some tea and scones. There, they discover that the tea is made from cannabis, and share a kiss in the greenhouse. After Thomas manages to defeat Johnny White, the local gangster, Thomas enters his bedroom to discover Panda is sitting on his bed in her underwear, and she persuades him to take her virginity. However, before they can consummate, Thomas' mother arrives and, horrified by the presence of alcohol, drugs and sex in the apartment, drags him back to the Congo, breaking Pandora's heart. In \\"Pandora, Pandora is still reeling from the loss of Thomas and attempts to console herself by organising a \\"girls only\\" birthday pyjama party with Effy, Katie, Emily, and Naomi, with the sole intention of playing Twister and learning about sexuality from her friends. Her mother, Angela, is revealed to be somewhat neurotic and old-fashioned, forcing the girls to throw away all of their cigarettes and alcohol, treating them like little children and trying to keep the party free of any boys. The girls are soon bored and drug Angela with MDMA in some brownies. The girls quietly express disgust over Pandora's behaviour behind her back. When the party gets out of hand, after Katie's footballer boyfriend brings his friends over and JJ and Cook attempt to sneak in, Pandora retreats to the bathroom in tears, angry with Effy, whom she believes spiked the brownies, pining for her boyfriend. When she finally comes out, Cook is the only one left at the party and, seeing her distraught, he suggests they play Twister, cheering her up. After they finish, Cook offers to take her virginity, and they proceed to have sex. The next day, Effy sees Pandora with Cook and is hurt. When Effy confronts her, Pandora demonstrates a more empowered and mature side to herself and angrily informs Effy that Cook belongs to nobody. At that moment, Thomas returns and the two have a tearful reunion. In \\"JJ,\\" it is revealed that, despite Pandora's relationship with Thomas, she is still continuing an affair with Cook, after JJ sees her leaving his apartment and hides. Cook later confesses to his affair with Pandora after JJ gives him some drugs that make him more honest. This prompts an angry breakup between Pandora and Thomas in Effy Stonem. In \\"Effy,\\" Effy offers some Magic mushrooms she picked to the gang. The camp-out is later interrupted by Cook attempting to scare the lot of them. Cook then reveals the affair he and Pandora shared, causing Thomas to run off into the woods and leave, ending their relationship. Pandora punches Cook in the face, ending her affair with him. After discovering what Effy did to Katie that night, Pandora joins the gang in shunning Effy. In \\"Katie and Emily,\\" Thomas and Pandora eventually reconcile at the school prom night and their relationship is rekindled. =Series 4= In \\"Thomas,\\" Pandora is shaken after a girl commits suicide at Thomas' nightclub. Having nowhere to go, she stays at Thomas' apartment with his mother and siblings. They quietly have sex in Thomas' room when everyone is asleep. Not long after, Thomas has sex with a girl from the local church and confesses his infidelity to Pandora afterwards. She is horrified and breaks up with him. Under advice from Effy, she does not take him back after he sorts out his and his family's lives, and throughout the series, continues to cruelly reject him. Pandora makes fewer appearances in the series, usually seen alongside Effy at parties or continually rebuffing Thomas' persistent advances. Near the end, after Effy attempts suicide, she regularly visits her at the mental hospital in which she is being interred. In \\"Everyone,\\" Pandora and Katie organise a musical recital to attempt to cheer Effy up. After she manages to achieve exceptionally high grades, she is accepted into Harvard University in the United States, and Thomas, who had achieved a running scholarship, joins her, implying another reunion. In an unseen scene, Pandora is revising for history in a local library, when she gets tutored by an expert. She is caught 'doodling', and accused of not taking her much needed help seriously. However, Pandora tries harder and makes progress in history. The history expert in the library is strongly implied to be Pandora's father, after a deep conversation between the two.

It was founded around 1794, and follows the Gelug school. The head of the monastery belongs to a lineage of incarnations that dates back to 1402. There is dispute over the current incarnation. The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, then rebuilt in the 1980s. History Kunde Ling means \\"peaceful and happy\\" in the Tibetan language. The original Kunde Ling Monastery was built in 1794, one of four royal temples in Lhasa. It is thought to have been the successor to the Yangs-pa-can, or Yangs-can, monastery founded in 1490 and destroyed in 1792. the Qing Emperor established the Kundeling Temple in lhasa near the Potala Palace and offered it to that Tatsak in celebration of the success of the Gurkha War. A Qing inscription translated by Hugh Richardson at the site of the monastery states that the Chinese military commander Fu Kang'an (d.1796) and the amban Helin, who served in Lhasa in 1793, founded the as a religious offering for the military victory. The inscription also gives possession of the temple to the Tatsak in perpetuity. It henceforth served as the seat of the Tatsak incarnation, and subsequent incarnations of the Tatsak Jedrung were also known as the Kundeling Hutuktu. The monastery was built outside the city walls of Lhasa on the road leading west. It followed the Gelug school. Kun-bde gling is known for owning the printing blocks for the religion-historical work called The Blue Annals (Deb-ther sngon-po), written in 1478. It also owned blocks for various other works. By 1830 the monastery owned extensive estates acquired by imperial grants, donations or purchase from the local peasants. These provided income to support the monastery. Kundeling was destroyed in the early 1960s during the Cultural Revolution, A much smaller Kundeling monastery was built slightly to the west of the former location in the 1980s. Monasteries are important tourist attractions in Lhasa. In 2011 the government had allocated about US $3 million for restoration of the building's fabric, including repairs to the roof, walls, courtyard and drains. That year the monastery was listed as a key protected cultural site. Today The monastery is at the foot of the Bar-ma ri (Parma Ri) mountain, below the Ges-ar Temple, which it owned. It is near Beijing Middle Road. Two restored chapels are open to visitors. On an upper level there is a mural of the original temple, which was mostly destroyed. In 2011 it was reported that there were forty-two monks, of whom ten were teenagers or in their early twenties. This was down from eighty in the 1990s. The young monks undertake most of the work of cleaning, cooking and minor repairs. Their life is austere, with no modern conveniences. Tatsag lineage The proprietors of the monastery, who hold the title rTa-tshag rje- drung ho-thog-thu, or sometimes rTa-tshag rje-drung rin-po-che, are considered to be incarnations. The first member of the Tatsag lineage was Baso Chokyi Gyaltsen (Wylie Ba-so Chos-kyi rgyal-mtshan; 1402‚Äì73). The eighth incarnation, Yeshe Lobsang Tenpai Gonpo (1760‚Äì1810), was granted ownership of the monastery. Proprietors of the monastery since then have been: :8. rTa-tshag (III) Ba-so rje-drung qutuqtu Ye-shes blo-bzang bstan-pa'i mgon-po alias Yi- hsi luo-sang tan-pei kung-pu (1760‚Äì1810) :9. rTa-tshag (IV) Ngag-dbang blo- bzang bstan-pa'i rgyal-mtshan alias Luo-pu-sang tan-pei chien-ts'an (1811‚Äì48) :10. rTa-tshag (V) Ngag-dbang dpal-ldan chos-kyi rgyal-mtshan alias A-wang pan-tien ch'u-chi chien-ts'an (1850/1854‚Äì86) :11. rTa-tshag (VI) Ngag-dbang thub-ldan skal-bzang sgron-me (1888‚Äì1918) :12. rTa-tshag (VII) Blo-bzang thub- bstan 'jigs-med rgyal-mtshan (1924‚Äì56) The eighth and tenth members of this lineage served as regents of Tibet (1789‚Äì90, 1791‚Äì1811, 1875‚Äì86). The thirteenth member of the lineage as recognized by the Dalai Lama was rTa-tshag (VIII) bsTan-'dzin chos-kyi rgyal-mtshan, born about 1958. He fled to India in 1959.

The Shawnee crossed the flooded Driftwood River and, thinking they had lost their pursuers, set up camp on an island in the east fork of the White River. One of Tipton's scouts located the trail, however, and the rangers cautiously approached the river. Major Tipton ordered the rangers to maintain absolute silence, and tied one ranger to a tree when he kept talking.* Also on archive.org The militia took positions along the bank of the river and opened fire. The Shawnee were taken by surprise, but returned fire for about half an hour. Few casualties were suffered due to the firing distance across the river and the shelter provided by the wooded island.Allison, 250 One Shawnee was killed and several were wounded, but a few drowned when they tried to swim across the flooded White River. The militia could not pursue the Shawnee across the river, so they returned to Fort Vallonia.

SolarWinds is headquartered in Austin, Texas, with sales and product development offices in a number of locations in the United States and several other countries around the world. The company was publicly traded from May 2009 until the end of 2015, and again from October 2018. It has also acquired a number of companies, some of which it still operates under their original brand names including Pingdom, Papertrail, and Loggly. History SolarWinds was officially founded in 1999 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and (as of 2009) had maintained profitability since its founding. The company was co-founded by Donald Yonce (a former executive at Walmart) and his brother David Yonce. SolarWinds released its first products, Trace Route and Ping Sweep, earlier in March 1998 and released its first web-based network performance monitoring application in November 2001. According to Michael Bennett, who became the chief executive officer in 2006, the name SolarWinds was chosen by an early employee and that the company has nothing to do with solar or wind power. In 2006, the company moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas, where about 300 of the company's total 450 employees were based as of 2011. During 2007, SolarWinds raised funding from Austin Ventures, Bain Capital, and Insight Venture Partners. SolarWinds completed an initial public offering of $112.5 million in May 2009, closing at higher prices after its initial day of trading. The IPO from SolarWinds was followed by another from OpenTable (an online restaurant-reservation service), which was perceived to break a \\"dry spell\\" (caused by the Great Recession) in which very few companies went public. Both Bain Capital and Insight Venture Partners backed the IPO and used the opportunity to sell some of their shares during the offering. Analysts and company executives forecasted continued expansion post-IPO, including several acquisitions. In 2010, Bennett retired from his position as CEO and was replaced by the company's former chief financial officer Kevin Thompson. In May 2013, SolarWinds announced plans to invest in an operations hub in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was named by Forbes as \\"Best Small Company in America, citing high-functioning products for low costs and impressive company growth.\\" By 2013, SolarWinds was employing about 900 people. In October 2015, the company disclosed that it was in talks with a then-unnamed party interested in acquiring the company and making SolarWinds a privately held company again. An acquisition by the private equity technology investment firms Silver Lake Partners and Thoma Bravo, LLC. was announced in late 2015, and by January 2016, SolarWinds was taken into private ownership in a $4.5 billion deal. As of the sale, the company employed 1,770 people worldwide of which 510 were based in Austin and reported revenues of about half a billion dollars a year. In November 2017, SolarWinds released AppOptics which integrates much of the SolarWinds acquired software portfolio, including Librato and TraceView, into a single software-as-a-service package. AppOptics included compatibility with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. In September 2018, SolarWinds filed for an IPO again, after three years of being owned by private equity firms. SolarWinds completed their IPO on October 19, 2018. SolarWinds reportedly updated its Network Performance Monitor product in December 2018 with enhancements for Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI). Acquisitions According to The Wall Street Journal, SolarWinds offers freely downloadable software to potential clients and then markets more advanced software to them by offering trial versions. Following the funding in 2007, SolarWinds acquired several companies including Neon Software and ipMonitor Corp. and opened a European sales office in Ireland. During and after its IPO in 2009, SolarWinds acquired a number of other companies and products, including the acquisition of the New Zealand-based software maker Kiwi Enterprises, which was announced in January 2009. SolarWinds acquired several companies in 2011 and was ranked No. 10 on Forbes Magazine's list of fastest-growing tech companies. In January 2011, it acquired Hyper9 Inc, an Austin-based virtualization management company with undisclosed terms. In July, SolarWinds completed the acquisition of the Idaho-based network security company TriGeo for $35 million. TriGeo's offices in Post Falls were added to the list of SolarWinds location which already included satellite offices in Dallas, Salt Lake City, and Tulsa, as well as operations in Australia, the Czech Republic, India, Ireland, and Singapore. In early 2012, only about a month after acquiring Dameware, SolarWinds acquired the patch management software provider EminentWare. In December, SolarWinds acquired RhinoSoft, adding the company's product FTP Voyager to SolarWinds suite of tools and services. In May 2013, SolarWinds acquired N-able Technologies (2013), a cloud-based information technology services provider. The deal was reportedly valued $120 million in cash. In October, it acquired the Boulder, Colorado- based database performance management company Confio Software. With the $103 million agreement, SolarWinds gained a sales office in London and Confio's main product, Ignite. Between 2014 and 2015, the company acquired the Swedish web-monitoring company Pingdom, the San Francisco-based metrics and monitoring company Librato (for $40 million), and the log management service Papertrail (for $41 million). During 2015, SolarWinds announced its acquisition of Librato (a monitoring company), and Capzure Technology (an MSP Manager software to N-able which SolarWinds had previously acquired). In June 2016, SolarWinds acquired LogicNow, a rival remote monitoring software company. A new subsidiary SolarWinds MSP was formed by merging LogicNow and N-able Technologies. The company announced that the subsidiary will be led by LogicNow's former CEO Walter Scott with a new title of executive vice president. Between 2017 and 2019, SolarWinds acquired five companies: * SpamExperts (an email security company), * Loggly (a log management and analytics company), * Trusted Metrics (a provider of threat monitoring and management software), * Samanage (a service desk and IT asset management provider), * VividCortex (a database performance monitor).

She is introduced in the third series. Her twin sister Emily is played by Megan's real-life twin Kathryn \\"Kat\\" Prescott Characterisation Katie‚Äîalong with identical twin Emily‚Äîwas born in 1992 to Jenna Fitch, a beautician turned wedding planner and Rob Fitch, the gym owner of \\"Fitch Fitness\\". Being the older twin by a few minutes Katie is notably more aggressive, controlling, and extroverted in contrast to younger twin Emily's quieter nature. During their childhood she and Emily created a secret language that only they can understand called \\"Twin Speak\\". In the first episode of series three Katie states with pride that she has never been without a boyfriend since age seven. On her official Skins page, she discusses the difference between her and her sister. Considered by many to be shallow, self-centred, and somewhat ruthless‚Äîespecially towards Naomi Campbell, JJ Jones, Effy Stonem, and her sister Emily‚ÄîKatie is isolated from the gang for much of her first year at Roundview College, for which she is mainly on a quest for popularity during series three. Though she eventually forms a relationship with Freddie McClair, the couple is short lived after she suspects his feelings for Effy, where an argument that leads to an accident between her and Effy nearly threatens her life. This event would prove to be a life altering experience for Katie, whose sensitive, highly insecure nature, and fear of being alone is revealed. By the fourth series Katie's personality develops significantly. She decides to get a responsible boyfriend and direct her energy into her mother's wedding planning business \\"Let's Get Fitched\\", though upon learning that she is infertile, she begins to question the future she'd always imagined for herself as well as her own identity. However, after coming to an understanding with her parents and reconciling with Emily (while tolerating Naomi), and gaining friendships with Thomas, Pandora, Effy and Freddie, Katie becomes fully integrated into the gang and more openly expresses a caring side. Katie has also kept her outspoken personality, most vocally standing up for Kanye West in the aftermath of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Character history =Series 3= She is initially quite mean to Emily, as she tries to shed her twin, establishing her individuality, and seemingly trampling on her sister as she does so. She does it to the point where Effy comments that Katie treats Emily like a \\"doormat\\". She is dating a footballer named Danny. She wants to be popular and tries to befriend Effy Stonem, who seems to be the most popular girl in school. She is deeply homophobic against Naomi, as she thinks that Naomi forced herself on Emily (when in fact Emily initiated the kiss). During Cook's birthday party, Emily tells Katie that she was the one who kissed Naomi, not the other way around. Later, during Pandora's birthday party, Katie sees Naomi and Emily kissing in a jump house, and is shaken. Soon, her boyfriend, Danny, and all his friends, show up and crash Pandora's party, and turn it into a mess. Eventually, Effy loses her queen bee status to Katie, something she revels in. She enters into a sexual relationship with Freddie after dumping Danny, partly because she likes him but partly to get back at Effy. After Emily and JJ catch her having sex with Freddie, JJ accidentally reveals Emily's homosexuality to her, and this eventually awakens her to the fact that her sister is gay. During a party in the woods, Katie tries to be the head of the party but fails due to Effy finding shrooms and her closeness to the rest of the gang. Katie makes it very apparent that she doesn't want Effy there, After Cook crashes the party and reveals that Effy doesn't want him anymore, Katie grows more anxious that Effy instead wants Freddie, leading to her heading off in the woods alone. Cook continues and reveals to Effy he has been sleeping with Pandora repeatedly which also after which Effy starts to suffer from a bad trip. It's then she meets Katie again; what happens next is never really clarified as Effy is tripping and the scene is told from her point of view. Katie goes from comforting her to telling her about bugs in her hair, then acting as if this never happened. Katie then breaks down in tears and begs Effy to not take Freddie from her, but when she tries to comfort her, Katie becomes hostile. Claiming that she couldn't take him if she tried, she tackles Effy to the floor and starts rubbing her face in the mud before flipping her over, strangling and slapping her. This causes Effy to freak out and grab the closest thing she could find, a rock, into Katie's head, knocking her unconscious. Effy returns to the camp and has sex with Freddie, but the next morning when people question Katie's whereabouts she says nothing, ashamed and unsure of what to do. Eventually Effy calls an unknown person (presumably the police or an ambulance) and requests they come and get Katie. Katie's injuries (9 stitches in her head as well as various bruises) make her too embarrassed to leave the house, so Emily disguises herself as her sister and sits for her exam. Katie ignores Emily when her sister comes out to her, telling her \\"you're not gay, you're just stupid\\". She later confronts Naomi after Emily comes out to her parents, telling her to stay away from Emily. She tells Naomi that Emily slept with JJ while she and Naomi were having problems; thus causing Emily and Naomi to fight. This enables Emily and Katie to go to the school ball with JJ and Freddie (respectively). However, Katie acknowledges to Freddie that she knows she is second choice to Effy. Eventually, Naomi shows up at the ball and Katie pulls her aside and reminds her to stop talking to Emily. However, Emily overhears what Katie did and they both begin to fight. Emily gains the upper hand but doesn't hurt her sister, instead picking her up and saying that she loves Katie, but she isn't her; Emily is gay and is in love with Naomi. Katie finally seems to accept that her sister is her own person. =Series 4= Katie is seen at a huge party at the club that Thomas works, she is present when the girl Sophia kills herself after taking a bad batch of MDMA. Katie now has a new boyfriend, Sam. Later, Emily, unable to understand why their mother can't accept her homosexuality and her relationship with Naomi, decides to move out leaving Katie heartbroken. Katie tries to make her stay, even using their secret language, but Emily leaves. It is revealed that their father had lost his gym, making him bankrupt. Later, Katie is working with her mother on her new wedding planning business - and their first client is Brandy - a fellow Bristol Rovers WAG with zero class and a mother with bad manners. Katie, realising that she hasn't had a menstrual cycle for some time, goes to the doctor to see if she is pregnant. The doctor tells her that she isn't pregnant, but going through a premature menopause; thus she won't be able to have children. A shocked Katie leaves the clinic and dumps Sam. After trying to reach Emily, she heads home to tell her mum. Before she's given the chance to talk about her problem, her mum makes a discovery whilst on the phone to the bank - the Fitch family are broke and have lost everything. And Rob's been hiding the evidence under the couch. Jenna loses it and Katie's left consoling a confused James Fitch. When Katie gets to Brandy‚Äôs hen party theme's been changed - by her ex-boyfriend Danny's new girlfriend. She soldiers on until Brandy's mum reveals to everyone that Brandy's pregnant. Then Katie sees Effy and Freddie. Colliding with Effy once again, Katie's almost at the point where she fights back. Then Danny's girlfriend humiliates her and she retaliates. Storming on to the dance floor, Katie punches her, and she's thrown out and sacked as the wedding planner. Outside, Effy tries to console Katie. Katie reveals her plans for the future, which aren't so certain now, and she doesn't know who she is anymore. Effy and Katie bond and it seem to strike up a friendship. Katie heads home and the bailiffs arrive to repossess their home and they're left with one option - do a runner with as much stuff as they can. They have nowhere to go - they've got nothing. So Katie suggests Naomi's, and is forced to ask her for help. It's when Emily arrives home after a night out, that Katie realises things are not well with Naomi and Emily. Emily is angry with everyone and out of control. Emily throws an impromptu BBQ with revellers from the night before, Katie watches Emily from her chair while talking to Naomi and Effy. Naomi clearly isn't happy and makes it clear this isn't the first time Emily has behaved like this. When Emily's request for more pills is declined, she grows angrier and out of spite, kisses a girl in front of everyone. Katie watches on in shock as Emily then runs at Naomi and pushes her into the paddling pool. Fed up with hiding and secrets, Naomi announces to everyone that she sold Sophia the drugs and also had slept with her. This seems to break Emily as she starts crying before confronting both her mother and Katie, the later slapping her before walking off. Thomas gets locked in the bathroom as Katie's having a bath. Katie wants to make sure she's still attractive, and they start to kiss. They stop kissing, and Katie asks him if he thinks she is a bitch, because she feels like many people see her that way. However, Thomas tells her that she is honest, even if it hurts people to hear it. Katie then tells Thomas the reason for her insecurity (her not being able to have children) and asks him if he think boys will still want to marry her, even if she can't give them children. Thomas replies that any man would be lucky to have her. This event causes Katie to feel better about herself, and she decides to help reunite Thomas and Pandora to make him happy too. Fresh from her bath, Katie finds Emily huddled on a mattress on the floor and comforts her. The Fitch family return to their old home to collect Jenna. Katie goes in first and tells her she can't have children. Katie tells her she's not going to ever be the same as her mother and she wants her mother to love her no matter what. She tells her mother to stop pushing them away; her mother takes Katie's advice thus reuniting the family. Later, Katie is seen at Effy's \\"goodbye party\\", saying that she doesn't want to party with goths. She tells Freddie that she doesn't know where Effy is. Later, Katie is dancing in the Judgment Day Parade, and sees a freaked out Effy (who is falling deeper into her psychotic depression) and pulls her out from the crowd. She signals to Freddie to get her, as Effy was visibly shaken. The two then take her to Freddie's grandad's nursing home and he suggests Katie take her to the cafeteria to get some tea. As Freddie is talking to his grandad, Katie bursts into the room and scaredly tells him that Effy won't come out of the toilet. Freddie races there and is quick enough to save Effy who has just cut her wrists. Katie then seems to spend the majority of her time at the psychiatric hospital Effy is being kept in following her suicide attempt. Along with Pandora, they cheer her up with talking and a song Pandora has written. On the bus heading home afterwards, Katie starts her plan to help Thomas and Pandora, so drops hints about Thomas tutoring her one-on- one for French, hoping to spark up some jealousy; it doesn't seem to work though. When they are having their lesson however, what Katie doesn't realise is that Thomas is actually just making her repeat dirty phrases. They both know Pandora is outside but what they're not aware of is that she took various exams in secret and got an A* on her French exam so can understand everything. After she has run away, Katie asks just what she has actually been saying to which Thomas gestures towards her chest. As they are play-fighting, Katie kisses Thomas again before pulling away as she knows that he loves Pandora. Katie received two C¬¥s and a B from her A-levels. Arriving with Emily at Freddie's shed, Katie witnesses Naomi and Emily finally make up properly, and in her last scenes she is drinking shots with everyone and having fun.

It was an nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short in 1990. Summary Each piece of history is presented as a simple vignette, usually depicting a few simply-drawn characters arguing and making war, over and over again. Generally, a single figure is meant to stand in for an entire group (i.e., a single Caesar-like caricature for the entire line of Roman Emperors). There is very little spoken dialogue; instead, most of the cartoon is accompanied by a bouncy piano-driven score, which frequently changes style to suit the particular historical era. However, the score rests on a single simple theme, to which it frequently returns in between vignettes. Plot In the course of 9 minutes, Grasshoppers takes us through the following parts of history: * The discovery of fire, and the development of tools and weapons, which Modern Man uses to remove the threat of the larger but less intelligent Neanderthal; * Ancient Egypt: an animal worshipper clashes with a sun-worshipper; * A tragedy in Ancient Greece, where a dancer and a musician fall in love and are killed by a king, who is then attacked and defeated by the Roman Empire; * The Roman Empire, represented by a single \\"Caesar-like\\" figure, who repeatedly sends troops off to plunder the cultures at the fringes of the empire, until they eventually come back to defeat the now lazy, unprepared later Empire. The birth of Jesus Christ is also alluded to, but it only distracts the warring parties for a split second; * The continual fight for supremacy between the monarchies of medieval Western Europe (including an allusion to Joan of Arc); * The rise of Islam, leading eventually to the Crusades; * Genghis Khan's siege of China, and the construction of the Great Wall; * The Spanish conquest of the Americas; * The French Revolution; * The British/French Wars (possibly the wars of the First and Second Coalition); * The American Revolution; * The Napoleonic Wars; * The United States' systematic removal of Native Americans; * World War II and Nazi Germany, which leads to the Nuclear Age (a bright white flash from off-screen vaporizes goose-stepping Nazis, though not a literal occurrence, like many events in the cartoon, a metaphor for the fact that the atomic bomb effectively ended World War II, and ushered in a frightening new era); * Recent years, up to the present day (1990, the year of the cartoon), which encompasses the Cold War, the Vietnam and/or Korean Wars, and the continual skirmishing that occurs still today, between every nation, organization, and individual. As the centuries (and later decades) pass, the pace of the animation grows gradually faster and more frantic. At the beginning and end of the cartoon, and occasionally in between vignettes, the cartoon abandons the struggles of humanity to focus briefly on a shot of grass growing and insects buzzing over the ruins of previous battles. In the final shot, the camera finally zooms in tighter on the grass to allow us to glimpse two grasshoppers happily mating.

She is introduced in the third series. Her twin sister Katie is played by Kathryn's real-life twin Megan Prescott. Characterisation On her blog, Emily notes her name means \\"to rival\\" which she finds ironic, as she's a twin. What's even more ironic to her is that her sister's name means \\"pure and virginal,\\" a nod to how many boyfriends Katie has had. During Naomi's episode in series 3, stylist Kirstie Stanway began to differentiate between Emily and her twin sister Katie's hair and makeup to show that the twins are starting to \\"move along their own paths\\". Originally, an entire scene was supposed to be filmed with Naomi and Emily in the lake, but the water was so cold that the actors were unable to stay in the water, and Kathryn Prescott was taken to a standby ambulance with suspected hypothermia. Director Simon Massey choreographed Naomi and Emily's sex scene prior to filming so that, on the set, the actions would come instinctively to the actors and they would be able to complete the scene in a limited number of takes. Prescott stated that the scene concerned her, though she said that she was not pressured to do anything in the script that made her uncomfortable. In her most difficult times, she finds a source of support in her friendship with JJ Jones, after running into him at a clinic where she was receiving a course of counselling and learning about his Asperger syndrome. It is to him that she first confides about her homosexuality, in turn encouraging him to take control of Freddie and Cook's feud, and it is to her that he finally loses his virginity. Emily's character becomes more confident in series 4, following her coming out and subsequent relationship with Naomi. Prescott accidentally let slip that the couple \\"die happy\\" in relation to not being able to act as Emily in the following series. Ed Hime, writer of Emily's series 4 episode stated that \\"hugeness of Emily‚Äôs love makes her unique in Skins world and those kinds of people are scary to be in relationships\\". He commented that Emily has the traits of an \\"intrepid detective\\", citing Emily's traits - \\"her purity, intelligence, bravery and tenacity\\" are \\"traits that make a great private eye\\".Writers Blog Episode 2 Ed Hime praised Prescott for having \\"beautiful eyes that just take everything in\\" and stated that she was great at \\"giving Naomi longing looks\\". Prescott commented that she \\"thought Naomi was a bitch\\" for cheating, pointing out costar Loveless would agree as well, but had let slip that the couple end up happy. Character history Emily was born in 1992 to Rob and Jenna Fitch. She is the younger twin, often being overshadowed by Katie. Growing up, the two made up a secret language only each other could understand, called \\"Twin\\". =Series 3= Emily's first appearance in the series occurs when she is getting ready for her first day at Roundview College. Angry at her sister for using all the hot water and taking her clothes, Emily resigns herself to getting a ride to college from Danny, who comments that she should be more like Katie. During the assembly, Emily can be seen observing Naomi, who appears to be angry and shocked at the same time. Before class, Effy comments that Emily is like a \\"doormat\\". Introducing herself, Emily reveals her on interesting fact is that she has never had a boyfriend, in contrast to Katie's statement. At Cook's birthday party, Emily tells Katie that she was straight, not the other way around. She states that \\"she just felt like kissing somebody\\" but later apologises to Naomi. During Pandora's pyjama party, Emily kisses Naomi, to which the latter reciprocates, who reasons \\"it's just the drugs\\". Unknown to her, Katie actually sees Naomi and Emily kissing for the second time in the bouncy castle and appears to be shaken. In the \\"Naomi\\" centric episode, Emily encourages Naomi to run for president, but Naomi refuses. Later when Naomi arrives home, Emily is found waiting with another registration form in the Naomi's room. Emily leaves when Naomi is rude and standoffish to her but Emily returns and confronts her coldly telling her that she is not obsessed with pursuing a sexual relationship with her. Naomi suggests she stay the night with her, the two ending up drunk. The following morning, Emily wakes up alone; Naomi having left for college. Emily leaves a note in Naomi's bed, where the latter cries herself to sleep following the humiliation of Cook's presidential campaign. After, Naomi and Emily escape to the countryside the next day and cycle to one of Emily's favourite places by a lake. After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire. The two then kiss and proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleas for Naomi not to leave her a second time, and telling her that she should accept that she needs to be loved. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying. They sit on opposite sides of the door, and Naomi admits that she does need somebody to love her. Emily offers her hand through the door's catflap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings. In JJ, Emily meets JJ at a clinic where she is getting counselling to be more truthful about herself, and secretly confides to him about her homosexuality, which he accidentally lets slip to Katie. In return, Emily encourages him to take control of Cook and Freddie's feud and make peace with Effy. At the end of the episode, she offers to take JJ's virginity, which he does. Katie's injuries make her too embarrassed to leave the house, so Emily disguises herself as her sister and sits for her exam. Katie ignores Emily when her sister comes out to her, telling her \\"you're not gay, you're just stupid\\". Unknown to Emily, Katie later confronts Naomi after Emily comes out to her parents, telling her to stay away from Emily, telling Naomi that Emily slept with JJ while she and Naomi were having problems; thus causing Emily and Naomi to fight. This enables Emily and Katie to go to the school ball with JJ and Freddie (respectively). Eventually, Naomi shows up at the ball, angry at Emily for not telling her about JJ. Emily later overhears Naomi and Katie arguing, and pulls Katie away, both fighting each other. Emily gains the upper hand but doesn't hurt her sister, instead picking her up and saying that she loves Katie, but Emily isn't her; and walks off with Naomi. =Skins: The Novel= The novel, written by Ali Cronin describes the summer between series 3 and 4. Emily and Naomi are happily together, but Emily must join her family for a vacation to France. Naomi worries about her future, debating whether to choose Emily or further her education. Matters are made worse when Katie takes Emily's phone away, thus effectively cutting off the two from communicating with each other. In the end, Emily notes that she herself is selfish, even though Naomi and herself made up she is preventing Naomi from pursuing her education. =Series 4= Emily's first appears in series 4 at a nightclub, kissing Naomi. She's visibly shocked when Sophia commits suicide, unaware that Sophia has passed by her several minutes before. Her centric episode focuses on the couple's happiness, but Emily becomes suspicious when the police turns up and interviews them both on Sophia's suicide. Behind Naomi's back, Emily visits Sophia's family, taking a wooden box and a university prospectus with a key inside. She leaves and later, when flicking through the prospectus, she finds a photo of Sophia laughing with Naomi. She realises that Naomi did in fact know the dead girl and suspects that she might have cheated on her with Sophia. She interrupts Naomi's class by slamming the picture of Sophia and Naomi into the window, the two argue about lying and Naomi admits that she indeed met Sophia at a University open day which she was attending behind Emily's back. She insists they just talked and that nothing had happened between them. Still a bit doubtful, Emily tells her about the key she found and Naomi believes it is for Sophia's locker at the army base. They discover that Sophia was infatuated with Naomi and Emily makes up with her, having sex with Naomi in an army storage closet. Later, Emily, unable to understand why their mother can't accept her homosexuality and her relationship with Naomi, decides to move out leaving Katie heartbroken. Emily becomes suspicious when Naomi talks to other girls during a party. At dawn, Emily meets up with Sophia's brother, Matt, to open up the box. Despite Naomi showing up and telling Emily to forget it, Emily goes to the roof and opens the box to find Sophia's sketchbook. Through Sophia's drawings that depict her one-day affair with Naomi, Emily finds out that Naomi did in fact cheat on her. A distraught Emily leaves the roof with Naomi crying and calling after her. Emily returns home and tearfully tells her father that Naomi had cheated on her. As he consoles her, Rob tells her that he once cheated on Jenna, and that she should not worry as it gets better after it is worse. Emily goes back to Naomi's house, reading a note on the front door saying, \\"I'll do anything\\". The episode ends with Emily walking through the front door, seemingly following her father's advice. When Rob Fitch declares he's bankrupt, the entire Fitch family moves into Naomi's house, much to the anger of Emily. Emily throws an impromptu BBQ with revellers from the night before, Katie watches as Emily carries on the hedonism, Naomi blatantly doesn't want to be there, and Emily wants more pills. Then Emily turns increasingly angry and hedonistic, kissing a girl in front of everyone then pushing Naomi into the pool. Revealing her secret about Sophia, Naomi watches as Emily bursts into tears and lashes out at her mother, earning a slap from Katie. The twins later reconcile however, when Katie realises how heartbroken Emily is. Emily receives two B¬¥s and a C from her A-Levels. In the finale, Emily forgives Naomi after hearing the latter's confession of loving Emily since she was 12. Moved by the heartfelt confession, the two make amends and are seen being happy together. =Series 7= In season 7, Emily reappears in the two-part episode Skins Fire. She does not physically appear in part one although she is heard having an argument with Naomi, now living in London with Effy Stonem over Skype, and it is made clear that she is in New York City on a lucrative internship. Naomi is missing her enormously, and her close friendship with Effy is the only thing keeping her going. Emily appears in person in part two, having gotten some time off on her internship, and has decided to visit Naomi in London. Secretly, Naomi resists Effy's urging to tell Emily about her recent cancer diagnosis, saying that if she were to do so, Emily would drop everything and return to London at once, and the internship she worked so hard to get would be over, and her cancer is not yet serious. However, as Naomi's cancer progresses and eventually becomes terminal, Naomi becomes devastated at the inevitable pain she will have to cause Emily now that she has left it so late to tell her. Eventually, Emily is informed, and Effy greets her at the airport. A devastated Emily wordlessly slaps her across the face, before getting upset with her for having spent the time with Naomi that she could have spent, and tells her not to follow her to the hospital. Later on, however, Effy enters the hospital to find Emily has not yet entered Naomi's room, and she admits she doesn't know how she can forgive Naomi for not telling her sooner. Effy consoles her as she breaks down in tears and acknowledges that Naomi will die, and urges her to be strong for her as Naomi was when Emily fell out with her family. Bracing herself, Emily enters Naomi's room and climbs into bed with her, embracing her and sobbing into her shoulder. Naomi gives Effy a smile over her shoulder, happy that she can die peacefully with her beloved Emily by her side. Reception The \\"Naomily\\" storyline of Series 3 and 4 proved popular with lesbian viewers; a poll conducted by American gay women's media website AfterEllen.com ranked Naomi and Emily as the top two fictional lesbian and bisexual characters. AfterEllen.com also ranked her No.4 in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Emily has consistently been described as \\"brave\\". A critic for PopSugar.com found Emily's plea to Naomi as Naomi left the campsite \\"heartbreaking\\".

Thomas stands as being one of the only characters on the show who is not British-born, having originated from Sangha, Republic of the Congo; with his first language being French. He is a migrant who has recently arrived in Bristol, and is unused to the change in climate, and the British way of life. He became romantically involved with Pandora Moon. He is considerably kinder and more spiritual than most of the gang. Characterisation Thomas starts off the series being new to Britain and does not appear until the third episode of Series 3. Unlike the rest of the gang, into which he integrated via Pandora Moon and Effy Stonem, he is very friendly, honest and spiritual. Initially, he proves instrumental in getting the local gangster, Johnny White off the gang's back. Furthermore, he is one of the more popular members of the gang, consoling Emily whenever Naomi upsets her, making friends with JJ and helping him get his first girlfriend, and consoling Katie after she receives some bad news about her fertility. Thomas spends most of the series as Pandora's boyfriend, and, due to his working in a nightclub, he is able to get them into many raves and nightclubs throughout the series. His relationship with Pandora is troubled, and fraught with infidelity on both sides, which causes tensions throughout the series. Thomas' family, like him, are not used to the British way of life, and find it difficult to fit their African upbringing into their new lifestyle. His mother, Kosoke, takes her role as a mother somewhat seriously, and constantly berates Thomas whenever he challenges her. This proves difficult, especially as Thomas' brother, Daniel suffers from Cystic fibrosis, not helped by the damp and dusty apartment that they live in. Thomas' father is only mentioned once, when Kosoke brings him up in an argument with Thomas, and Thomas snaps \\"My father is DEAD!\\" Character history =Series 3= Thomas' first appearance is in the third episode, \\"Thomas\\" wherein he has just arrived in Bristol from the Congo, with his family planning to join him in a few days. He is somewhat taken aback by the rudeness that meets him, and moves into a squalid and supposedly abandoned apartment in the city. After he fights off some boys who are terrorising a newsagent, he obtains some free doughnuts, and it is while he is eating them that he first meets Pandora and Effy, with whom he shares the doughnuts. After Pandora eats too many and is violently sick, he and Effy carry her home, to discover that Effy's mother is having an affair with her husband's boss. Later on, Thomas is woken in his apartment by Johnny White and his minions, who reveal that Thomas is, in fact, using their apartment without their permission. They demand that Thomas pay them back, or else risk eviction, with Johnny drinking some boiling pot noodles to threaten him. Thomas finds employment at Roundview College, where Pandora and the gang attend. He starts to show signs of homesickness when Pandora encounters him after a dance class, which centred on Africa. She invites him over to her aunt's for tea and scones. The two discover that the \\"tea\\" is, in fact, cannabis, and plan to sell it to pay off Thomas' rent. The two then share a kiss in the greenhouse. After selling the weed on Johnny's turf, he challenges Thomas to a chilli eating competition. Little does he know, however, that the chillis he challenges Thomas to eat are, in fact, Thomas' favourite type, and after Thomas eats a massive handful, he wins the challenge. While celebrating the victory, Thomas enters his room to discover Pandora sitting on his bed in her underwear, in the hope that he will take her virginity. Before they can consummate, however, Thomas' mother, Kosoke arrives early and, seeing the lifestyle he is now in contact with, drags him back to the Congo, breaking his and Pandora's hearts. Thomas later returns to Britain in \\"Pandora\\", unaware that Pandora lost her virginity to Cook only the night before. He gets a job in a nightclub and continues to see Pandora. However, in \\"JJ,\\" Cook, after taking JJ's medication, accidentally reveals that he is continuing an affair with Pandora, in front of both Thomas and Freddie. At this point, Pandora isn't aware that Thomas knows about her infidelity. In \\"Effy\\", he watches Pandora speaking to Cook on the phone - however she pretends that she has been speaking to her mother and he does not challenge this, even though he knows that she is lying. Later on in the episode, Cook reveals to the whole gang (including his girlfriend Effy) that he and Pandora have been sleeping together. Pandora attempts to make up with Thomas but he states that he has already given her enough chances and that she is not the girl he fell in love with. In \\"Katie and Emily,\\" Thomas meets a tearful Emily, who has been having sex with Naomi, but left angrily without taking her shoes or coat, at a bus stop. He consoles her and gives her his jacket and shoes. Later on, he reconciles with Pandora at the school prom. =Series 4= Thomas's centric episode opens up the series when a local Army Cadet, Sophia, throws herself to her death at the nightclub in which Thomas works. Thomas suspects that she was high and that Cook sold her the drugs. In the aftermath, he is bribed to stay silent by the nightclub owner, although Kosoke is angry with him for accepting a bribe after such an event. After he is expelled from Roundview College and coming to blows with Cook, Thomas is depressed and distances himself from Pandora, developing a close proximity to the local African church instead. After Daniel suffers from his cystic fibrosis, Thomas has an angry confrontation with his mother, after she berates him for challenging her parenting technique and mentions his deceased father. Thomas then proceeds to have sex with the daughter of the local Parish pastor. He feels guilty and reveals his infidelity to Pandora over a movie with JJ, and she breaks up with him. He does not pursue a relationship with the pastor's daughter, and instead resolves to use the bribe money to buy a new house and get a new job at a local confectionery store, which Kosoke appreciates. However, he continues to be rebuffed and ostracised by Pandora, who refuses to take him back. In \\"Katie,\\" Thomas attends a party at Emily and Naomi's house, and accidentally locks himself in the bathroom with a naked Katie in the bath. The two share a kiss, but do not pursue a relationship. Thomas consoles her after she admits to having had a premature menopause, and is no longer fertile. Katie leaves feeling angry at the way Pandora treats Thomas. In \\"JJ,\\" Thomas has replaced Freddie and Cook as a friend of JJ, who now works at the same confectionery store as Thomas. When Thomas urges JJ to ask out Lara Lloyd, a beautiful colleague, and threatens to ask her out himself, JJ manages to win her affections. In \\"Everyone,\\" Thomas has taken up athletics, being a very fast runner. After his skill is spied on by a local trainer, Thomas is pushed into getting an athletics scholarship to Harvard University in the United States. He and Katie work towards getting Pandora back by pretending to be in a relationship, when he is, in fact, helping her with her French (French being his first language). At the end, it is revealed that Pandora is also going to Harvard after getting exceptional grades in her exams, and the two finally reconcile.

NASBO is the instrument through which the states collectively advance state budget practices. As the chief financial advisors to our nation‚Äôs governors, NASBO members are active participants in the public policy discussions at the state level. The major functions of the organization consist of research, policy development, education, training, and technical assistance. These are achieved primarily through NASBO‚Äôs publications, membership meetings, and training sessions. NASBO is an independent professional and educational association and is also an affiliate of the National Governors Association.  Membership  NASBO is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and educational organization. Each state and territory may designate up to three members. Members are often the directors of state finance departments, the states‚Äô chief budget officers, and their deputies. All staff in the budget offices are associate members. The organization also awards honorary and life memberships. The organization‚Äôs Executive Committee is the policy-making body. The Executive Committee consists of the President, the Immediate Past President, the President- Elect, four Standing Committee Chairs, four Regional Directors, two Members- at-Large, and up to two Special Committee Chairs.  Publications  Fiscal Survey of States This survey is published jointly with the National Governors Association twice a year in the spring and fall. Narrative analysis of trends and significant developments on the fiscal condition of the states, along with tabular summaries of state general fund revenues, expenditures, and balances are included in the report. It includes both individual and aggregate totals based on states' responses to a survey conducted by NASBO. The spring survey details governors' proposed budgets while the fall survey details enacted budgets. State Expenditure Report This annual report examines spending in the functional areas of state budgets: elementary and secondary education, higher education, public assistance, Medicaid, corrections, transportation, and all other. It also includes data on the State Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program and on revenue sources in state general funds. Budget Processes in the States This report is a state-by-state compilation of data on gubernatorial budget authority, budget agency organization and functions, balanced budget requirements and other aspects of the state budget process. It is a significant reference for state budget officers and others interested in the organization and operation of state government. State Health Expenditure Report This report provides a perspective of the significance of state health spending within the context of the nation‚Äôs provision of personal health care services. As both employers and providers of services, states have felt the demands from rising health care costs. States also have additional expenditures for population health, including an expanded role to protect the public‚Äôs safety. Capital Budgeting in the States This report provides information on how states approach capital budgeting by covering topics such as preserving facilities, managing the process, setting priorities, and financing projects.  Meetings and awards  NASBO provides numerous training opportunities. The organization has an Annual/Summer Meeting, a Fall Meeting, and a Spring Meeting. These national meetings focus on policy issues, intergovernmental issues, and economic trends. Associate meetings provide an opportunity for budget staff to meet their peers from other states and to engage in an informal exchange on various topics of regional or topic specific interest. NASBO also hosts an annual introductory seminar for new state budget staff. This seminar focuses on budget strategies, current events, ethics and techniques in state budgeting. Each year, NASBO honors state budget office employees at the executive and associate level. The Gloria Timmer award recognizes exceptional performance for those at the executive level within a state budget office. Most often, the recipients of the Gloria Timmer award have been budget directors or deputy budget directors. The George A. Bell award recognizes an associate member of NASBO who, as an employee of a state budget office, has made an exceptional contribution to state budgeting and management. Associate Members are budget analysts, unit supervisors, and other staff.

The inauguration marked the commencement of the second four-year term of Thomas Jefferson as President and the first four-year term of George Clinton as Vice President. Giving the oath of office was Chief Justice John Marshall.  Background  Unlike the contentious election of 1800, in which Jefferson narrowly defeated strong opposition from Federalists and a bipartisan conspiracy to replace him with his own running mate and campaign manager, Aaron Burr, with the House of Representatives determining the winner, the 1804 election was far less dramatic. The Federalists, severely weakened, struggled to muster serious opposition and to select a candidate. They settled on Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina. Due to several years of tension and mutual dislike between Jefferson and Burr, Burr was dropped from the Democratic-Republican ticket and replaced with George Clinton. Jefferson won the election in a landslide.  Inauguration  Jefferson rode to the Capitol on horseback on March 4, 1805, but much of Congress had already left after the body had adjourned following Burr's farewell address before the Senate a couple days earlier. Thus the inaugural ceremony was modest and appeared anticlimactic. The president spoke softly and quietly, as he was known for, and provided copies of his inaugural address. Jefferson wore a black suit and silk stockings for the inauguration. In the speech, he addressed the recent acquisition of Louisiana, the Federalists' diminishing influence, and the need for freedom of the press, though he also criticized recent press attacks against him.

The community of Parksville is located on the north side of the dam, and the city of Chattanooga is roughly to the west. The Ocoee Scenic Byway part of U.S. Route 64 passes just north of the dam. Parksville Lake extends for several miles eastward up the Ocoee and several miles southward up Baker Creek, which once emptied into the Ocoee just upstream from the dam.

Parksville Lake has of shoreline and the lake's water levels fluctuate by just per year. History Ocoee Dam No. 1 under construction in 1911 The rapid growth of industry in Chattanooga in the late 19th century and early 20th century brought an increasing demand for electricity, and the rapid-flowing Ocoee River which slices through a gorge in the mountains east of the city was considered a prime candidate for hydroelectric power by the region's early electric companies. In 1910, the C.M. Clark Company, an electrical transportation holding firm, formed the Eastern Tennessee Power Company to build two hydroelectric dams on the Ocoee, and market their electricity output primarily to Chattanooga. Work on Ocoee Dam No. 1 began later that year, and was completed in late December 1911. On January 27, 1912, Ocoee Dam No. 1's four units began commercial operation.James B. Jones, Jr. Towards an Understanding of the History and Material Culture of Pre-TVA Hydroelectric Development in Tennessee, 1900-1933. Retrieved: 22 January 2009. PDF. A fifth unit was added in 1914. The five units provided a total capacity of 18 MW. Power was distributed primarily to Chattanooga, and also to Knoxville, Nashville, and Rome, Georgia, as well as the aluminum industries in Alcoa. A coal burning station known as the Parksville Steam Plant was built adjacent to the dam in 1916 to provide generation during periods of low water flow. It was last used in 1954. In 1922, the Eastern Tennessee Power Company and several other entities merged to form the Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which overhauled Ocoee No. 1 in the 1930s.Tennessee Valley Authority, Design of TVA Projects Volume 3: Mechanical Design of Hydro Plants, Technical Report No. 24 (Washington, D.C.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1952), pp. 302-304.James B.

In 1933, the TVA Act created the Tennessee Valley Authority and gave the Authority oversight of the Tennessee River watershed, which includes the Ocoee River. The head of TEPCO, Jo Conn Guild, was vehemently opposed to the creation of TVA, and with the help of attorney Wendell Willkie, challenged the constitutionality of the TVA Act in federal court. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the TVA Act, however, in its 1939 decision Tennessee Electric Power Company v. TVA.

According to spectators in the gallery, Madison spoke softly at first with an obvious tremble but addressed the chamber louder as his speech went on. The new president wore a black suit. After the inaugural address and oath of office, Madison and his wife, Dolley Madison, welcomed visitors at their home on F Street where the huge crowd overwhelmed them. They subsequently attended an inaugural ball at Long's Hotel. Wearing a velvet dress, Dolley, the new First Lady, drew large crowds of admirers at the ball, while Madison described the occasion as exhausting and unpleasant.  Inaugural Address  On March 4, 1809, James Madison gave his Inaugural Address and was sworn into office as the fourth president of the United States of America. He addressed the nation on how he felt. He felt honor and responsibility in a way he could not express when elected president. He acknowledged that the United States is a country with a great deal of issues and difficulties, and the pressure of that hit him hard. He also mentions how great the United States was and how far it has come as a country in a short period of time. He informed the people that the country was trying to make peace and have good relations with all nations, especially with belligerent nations. He wanted to remain a neutral country as Americans progressed and built their nation. He mentioned that the US had one too many bloody and wasteful wars. \\"It has been the true glory of the United States to cultivate peace by observing justice.\\" Madison promised to meet with United States councils to make safeguards and to honor its essential interest with other nations. He wanted to build up and fund a strong military and militia, to defend the republic and the rights of the people. Madison ended his speech with gratitude towards people in the past who had done so much for the United States, and wished the best for the future of this young thriving country.

(abbreviation: Dispolok) was a locomotive leasing company wholly owned by Siemens Transportation Systems offering locomotives for hire to European rail operators. On 21 September 2006 it was bought by Mitsui Rail Capital Europe BV (MRCE) a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co. Ltd.. On 24 January 2008 the organisation was renamed MRCE Dispolok Ltd.. History Due to technical problems with different locomotives, including the diesel electric Locomotive ME26 (see NSB Di 6) Siemens found itself with locomotives that had been returned from the original purchaser. In order to avoid a total loss, and with the deregulation of rail transport in Europe taking place it was decided to offer these locomotives to private companies on a leased basis. Since the new privately owned rail companies were almost all entirely new companies with no experience or infrastructure to deal with locomotive maintenance the leasing agreements included full servicing to be provided by Siemens (or its associates). In addition Siemens offer the leasers an option to buy the locomotives later if they so wished. Since the concept of operation of the new company put it in competition with the main customers of Siemens Transportation Systems, Displok was created as an independent company with limited liability (see Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung) in order to avoid possible legal conflicts. =Mitsui acquisition and incorporation= Mitsui Rail Capital Europe (MRCE) became the owner of the Dispolok group of companies in 2006, with the acquisition Mitsui committed itself to the purchase of 50 Siemens electric locomotives of the Eurosprinter type.

The presidential oath was administered by Chief Justice John Marshall. Gerry died into this term, and the office remained vacant for the balance of it. (Prior to ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency.)  Background and Ceremony  During the War of 1812, incumbent Madison fended off a challenge by DeWitt Clinton, who received support from both Federalists and Republicans opposed to Madison and the war, in the 1812 United States presidential election. On March 4, 1813, Madison arrived at the capitol with an escort of marines and cavalry. Chief Justice Marshall, a long-time enemy of Madison's, allegedly appeared disgusted when giving the oath of office.

Early life Hulton was born to Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet, a newspaper publisher and racehorse owner originally from Manchester, and his second wife, music hall artist, actress and singer Millicent Warris, born Fanny Elizabeth Warriss or Wariss, also known by the stage name Millie Lindon. Educated at Harrow School, Hulton went up to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1925 but left in December 1926 without a degree. Business and politics Hulton founded the Hulton Press in 1937, buying Farmers' Weekly. The Hulton Press went on to publish Leader Magazine, Eagle, Girl, Robin and Swift comics for children, Lilliput and the Picture Post. During World War II, Hulton was one of the members of the 1941 Committee, a group of British politicians, writers and other people of influence not generally involved with a political party but who came together in 1941 to press for more efficient production to enhance the war effort. Hulton helped fund the Home Guard training school at Osterley Park, organising a private supply of weapons from the United States. Though he had stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate at Leek in 1929, his 1943 book The New Age supported a mixed welfare-state economy and he welcomed Attlee's 1945 government. Hulton discontinued the Picture Post in 1957 and sold the Hulton Press to Odhams two years later. He was knighted for services to journalism in 1957. Hulton photographic archive The photographic archive of Picture Post became an important historical documentary resource. It was set up by Hulton as a semi-independent operation, officially incorporated as the Hulton Press Library in 1947. It was bought by the BBC in 1958 and incorporated into the Radio Times photo archive, which was then sold to Brian Deutsch in 1988. In 1996 the Hulton Picture Collection was bought for ¬£8.6m by Getty Images, who has retained the Hulton Archive as a featured resource within its large holdings. Publications * Personal life Hulton was married twice, first to Kira Goudime-Levkovitsch in 1927, and then later in 1946 to Princess Nika Yourievitch. Together Yourievitch and Hulton had two sons and one daughter, named Edward Alexander Sergius Hulton, Cosmo Philip Paul Hulton and Elizabeth Frances Helen Hulton. The marriage between Yourievitch and Hulton was dissolved in 1966, though the two lived together again for the last nine years of Hulton's life before he died on 8 October 1988.

Monroe had almost unanimously won the election of 1820 for a second term. He was sworn in by John Marshall, the Chief Justice of the United States.

Around 3000 people crammed into the chamber for the occasion. Monroe arrived at noon in a plain carriage with his cabinet members behind him. Vice President Tompkins did not attend the occasion and instead took the oath of office in New York. In his inaugural address, Monroe addressed recent achievements in negotiating the acquisition of Florida from Spain, loosely endorsed a higher tariff, and called for efforts to civilize Native Americans after recent attacks. He generally avoided discussing the ongoing Panic of 1819 and the Missouri Compromise situation. After the speech, Monroe hosted an inaugural ball at Brown's Hotel.

It is the country's largest cultivator and producer of sugar, a commodity which is responsible for approximately 20% of Guyana's annual revenue and 40% of all agricultural production. They are also notable for selling Demerara Sugar, and also honey and sweeteners. The company as GuySuCo was formed in 1976, when the government of Guyana nationalised and merged the sugar estates operated by Booker Sugar Estates Limited, Tate and Lyle and Jessels Holdings to form the Guyana Sugar Corporation. One of its noted products is brown sugar produced in the Demerara River basin which is exported internationally to the European Union, the United States of America, and the Caribbean Community(Caricom) countries which include Trinidad, Suriname, St. Lucia, Grenada, Antigua, Dominica, Barbados, St. Vincent and Jamaica. History The rapid nationalization of the sugar industry in the mid-1970s led to severe management difficulties and an emigration of talent. The Guyana Sugar Corporation, which took over the sugar plantations, initially lacked needed experience and perhaps more importantly, did not have access to the reserves of foreign capital required to maintain sugar plantations and processing mills during economically difficult periods. When production fell, GuySuCo became increasingly dependent on state support to pay the salaries of its 20,000 workers. Second, the industry was hard-hit by labor unrest directed at the government of Guyana. A four-week strike in early 1988 and a seven-week strike in 1989 contributed to the low harvests. Third, plant diseases and adverse weather plagued sugar crops. After disease wiped out much of the sugarcane crop in the early 1980s, farmers switched to a disease-resistant but less productive variety. Extreme weather in the form of both droughts and floods, especially in 1988, also led to smaller harvests. Guyana exported about 85 percent of its annual sugar output, making sugar the largest source of foreign exchange. But the prospects for sugar exports grew less favorable during the 1980s. Rising production costs after nationalization, along with falling world sugar prices since the late 1970s, placed Guyana in an increasingly uncompetitive position. A 1989 Financial Times report estimated production costs in Guyana at almost US$400 per ton, roughly the same as world sugar prices at that time. By early 1991, world sugar prices had declined sharply to under US$200 per ton. Prices were expected to continue decreasing as China, Thailand, and India boosted sugar supplies to record high levels. In the face of such keen international competition, Guyana grew increasingly dependent on its access to the subsidized markets of Europe and the United States. The bulk of sugar exports (about 160,000 tons per year in the late 1980s) went to the European Economic Community (EEC) under the Lom√© Convention, a special quota arrangement. The benefits of the quota were unmistakable: in 1987, for example, the EEC price of sugar was about US$460 per ton, whereas the world price was only US$154 per ton. (The gap between the two prices was not so dramatic in other years, but it was significant.) Guyana was allowed to sell a much smaller amount of sugar (about 18,000 tons per year in 1989, down from 102,000 tons in 1974) in the United States market at prices comparable to those in the EEC under another quota arrangement, the Caribbean Basin Initiative. Maintaining preferential access to the European market was a priority in Guyana; in 1988 and 1989, production levels were too low to satisfy the EEC quota, so Guyana imported sugar at low prices and reexported it to the lucrative European market. Even so, Guyana fell 35,000 tons short of filling the quota in 1989 and 13,000 tons short in 1990. This date's back to 1658 when the crop was established as a viable one. Since then, the industry has progressed from periods of manuals and animal power to machine power and electronic equipment. The government of Guyana restructured the sugar industry in the mid-1980s to restore its profitability. The area dedicated to sugar production was reduced from 50,000 hectares to under 40,000 hectares, and two of ten sugarcane-processing mills were closed. GuySuCo also diversified into production of dairy products, livestock, citrus, and other items. Profitability improved, but production levels and export earnings remained well below target. In mid-1990, the government took an important step toward long-term reform of the sugar industry‚Äîand a symbolically important step toward opening the economy‚Äîwhen GuySuCo signed a management contract with the British firms Booker and Tate & Lyle. The Booker company owned most sugar plantations in Guyana until the industry was nationalized in 1976. A study by the two companies reportedly estimated that US$20 million would be needed to rehabilitate Guyana's sugar industry. In 2004 it was announced that the Guyana was moving to modernize its sugar industry to cushion the impact of the African, Caribbean and Pacific ACP countries on the world market. As part of a strategic plan to reduce costs and improve productivity, the Guyana Sugar Corporation and the China National Technology Import and Export Corporation (CNTIC) signed contracts on June 22, 2004 in Beijing. As a result of the $110 million agreement which was partly funded by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the Exim Bank of China, a new factory was built, which included the Skeldon Sugar cogeneration plant, a distillery and a refinery to be constructed at a later stage in 2008. The agreement was also made in compliance with the World Bank targets and obligations to contribute to an overall reduction of global greenhouse gases and to introduce modern technologies to the sugar industry which would improve efficiency. In November 2007, sugar factory workers of GuySuCo trained in South Africa to become familiar with the new technology.

Career As a Naval Reserve officer, Livingston served in Okinawa and earned a Bronze Star during World War II. His experience as a physician in a United States Navy hospital during the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lead him to a lifelong opposition to nuclear arms. He was co-founder and President of the San Diego chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility. After the war he joined the Yale University college of medicine as a professor of physiology. He served on the faculty of the University of California, Los Angeles from 1952 to 1960. In other teaching appointments at Stanford and Harvard he also taught pathology, anatomy, and psychiatry. In the 1950s he served as physician to a Scripps Institution of Oceanography expedition. He was appointed Scientific Director of the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. He advised James Humes, the navy pathologist who performed the autopsy on John F. Kennedy, and based on his personal experience and observations became a skeptic of the \\"Lone gunman theory\\". After his time at the National Institutes of Health, in 1964 Livingston founded the neuroscience department, the first of its kind in the world, at the newly built University of California, San Diego campus. He served as chairman of the department until 1970, as professor until 1989, and as professor emeritus until his death in 2002. His best known research was in the computer mapping and imaging of the human brain. His interest in the brain also extended to questions of cognition, consciousness, emotions, and spirituality. He was active in the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985. In 1988 Livingston met and befriended the Dalai Lama, for whom he served as a science advisor. He died in 2002 at the Thornton Hospital in San Diego, California.

It borders with Killimor , Portumna and Kiltormer GAA clubs in Galway and St. Rynaghs in Banagher Co. Offaly. A club founded in Meelick in the 1880s contested the first all-Ireland hurling final in 1887. The present club has players from the largely rural areas of Clonfert and Meelick, and the small village of Eyrecourt. These three areas make up the local Roman Catholic parish of Eyrecourt, Clonfert and Meelick, which is a small parish located on the south corner of the Diocese of Clonfert. Meelick and Clonfert originally formed separate hurling teams. The Meelick club was founded in 1884. The existing club is sometimes cited as being one of the oldest GAA clubs in Ireland. Meelick competed in the first All Ireland Hurling final of 1887 after defeating Kilbeacanty in the Galway County Cup. The club played opponents Thurles of Tipperary. Thurles defeated Meelick 1-1 0 0-0. Recent activities The club is primarily focussed on hurling while Gaelic football has been regarded as the club's second sport. However, during the 1960s Gaelic football was very strong in Meelick-Eyrecourt GAA club and the club contested two Junior Football county finals in the 1960s at a time when Galway football was arguably at its height and at the same time the Galway senior football team won its famous three-in-a-row all-Ireland finals. Despite having little success in terms of titles, this small club has always been recognised within Galway hurling circles as a producer of good hurling talent. The club last contested a senior hurling county final in 1980, which it lost. The club has fluctuated between senior hurling and intermediate grades, which is similar to senior 'B' in other counties, since the late-1990s but has still continued to produce many inter-county Galway hurlers at all grades. Alumni A number of players who originally played with the Meelick-Eyrecourt club went on to play hurling for other counties, particularly Dublin, due to emigration in the 1940s and 1950s. The former Meelick-Eyrecourt hurler Joe Salmon was named on the 'Galway team of the Millennium' at Mid-Field and was joined by fellow club member Sean Silke, who was named at Centre-Back. Although the competition does not carry the same prestige as it once did, a number of the club's players who played senior hurling with County Galway were subsequently selected to represent Connacht in the annual Railway Cup interprovincial hurling competition. Joe Salmon played a large part of his hurling career as a member of the Glen Rovers hurling club in Cork, where he worked and lived. Former Galway minor hurler and Meelick-Eyrecourt player Niall Corcoran, from Clonfert, currently plays on the Dublin senior hurling team and has played several times in the Leinster hurling championship. In 2011 he won a National Senior Hurling League medal with Dublin, playing corner back on the capital's team which defeated Kilkenny. Sean Silke and Brendan Lynskey are holders of All-Star awards and both won All-Ireland hurling final winners medals with the Galway senior hurling panel in the 1980s. Sean Silke played at centre-half back on the Galway hurling team that won the all-Ireland final in 1980, and Brendan Lynskey was at full-forward and centre-forward respectively when Galway won the all-Ireland final in both 1987 and 1988. Numerous players from the club have won underage all-Ireland medals at minor (under-18) and under-21 level. Players from the club have also won intermediate hurling all-Ireland medals. A large number of club players have played hurling for County Galway and a very small number have played Gaelic football for County Galway. A number of players from Meelick-Eyrecourt GAA club have won All Ireland medals at senior and underage grades in hurling while playing for County Galway. Prior to the county's all-Ireland success in 2017, Galway had never won a senior hurling all-Ireland without a Meelick-Eyrecourt clubman on the panel. Club member Noel Larkin was involved with the team's management.

It is found in the tropical and sub-tropical Indo-Pacific region and grows to a maximum length of . Description The doubleband surgeonfish is a deep-bodied, laterally- compressed oval fish, rather over twice as long as it is deep, with a maximum length of , although a more typical length is . The colour is variable, the sexes being similar except in the breeding season, when the mature male takes on a distinctive appearance. This fish is usually orange-beige, olive-tan or steely grey, but can turn a dark brown shade flushed with red or purple when stressed. A dark line runs along the base of the dorsal fin with a similar line at the base of the anal fin. There are two dark streaks behind the eye, and the scalpel-like scales that project from the caudal peduncle are blackish and surrounded by a large black spot with a bluish border. Both dorsal and anal fins are long, extending as far as the caudal peduncle. The caudal fin is crescent-shaped, the points growing longer as the fish ages. It is rimmed by a band of bluish-white. Distribution and habitat This species has a wide distribution across the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific region; its range extends from East Africa and Madagascar to southern India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. It occurs on rocks and coral reefs, on the reef slopes and in the channels between reefs, at depths down to about . Ecology The doubleband surgeonfish feeds on algae growing on the seabed and detritus, as well as the algal film that grows on sand and other substrates. Breeding involves the liberation of sperm and eggs into the sea. The larvae are pelagic, and return to the reef habitat about seven weeks later. The juveniles form mixed species groups with other fish species; at first they may be black, or yellow with a black eye ring, but later they resemble the adult fish, apart from the black markings behind the eye, which at one stage in juvenile development is horseshoe-shaped. This fish feeds in the open during the day, often in small groups with parrotfish and other species. Status This is a common fish in much of its range. It is sometimes caught for human consumption and for use in the aquarium trade. It is susceptible to the destruction of the reef habitats in which it lives, but is found in several marine protected areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Hicks, 533 U.S. 353 (2001), is a United States Supreme Court case regarding the jurisdiction of Tribal Courts when state officials are sued by tribal members in tribal court.. The Supreme Court unanimously decided that Tribal courts lack jurisdiction to decide tort claims or ¬ß 1983. claims related to State law enforcement's process on the reservation, but related to a crime that allegedly occurred off the reservation nor must the parties exhaust their claims in Tribal court before filing in federal court.  Background  Hicks was a member of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes of western Nevada and lived on tribal land. State of Nevada Game Wardens executed state and tribal search warrants for evidence that Hicks was in possession of two California Bighorn Sheep heads, a crime which had been committed off- reservation. He then filed suit in Tribal Court against the wardens and the State of Nevada for alleging trespass, abuse of process, and violation of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983. The Tribal Court ruled that it had jurisdiction over the tribal tort and federal civil rights claims and the Tribal Appellate court affirmed. The State of Nevada argued before Federal District Court that the Tribal Court had no such authority. The District Court agreed with the tribe, arguing that the Wardens had to exhaust immunity claims in tribal court. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed stating that the fact that Hicks lived on the reservation is enough to give the tribal courts jurisdiction.  Opinion of the Court  In the unanimous decision of the Court, Justice Scalia held that the tribal courts did not have the authority over the Wardens' allegedly tortious acts. Tribal authority over non-members beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government is not available without express congressional delegation, since delegation did not exist the tribal court had no jurisdiction. Finally, the tribal court has no authority to regulate state officers in their official capacities, stating that tribal law hinders state law no more than state law inhibits federal law. The Court applied Montana, which asserts that Tribes lack civil jurisdiction over conduct of nonmembers on lands where they lack the right to exclude unless (1) the nonmember entered a \\"consensual relationship with the Tribe or its members\\" or (2) the nonmember's \\"conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\\" Until this case, Montana was never explicitly invoked when the conduct occurred on Indian-owned land. However, the Court finds that the \\"general rule of Montana applies to both Indian and non-Indian land.\\" While \\"[t]he ownership status of land\\" may sometimes be \\"dispositive,\\" in general, it \\"is only one factor to consider in determining whether regulation of the activities of nonmembers is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations.‚Äù533 U.S. at 360 (internal quotations omitted). The Court found that \\"tribal authority to regulate state officers in executing process related to the violation, off reservation, of state laws is not essential to tribal self-government or internal relations.\\"533 U.S. at 364. Analogizing to the relationship between federal law enforcement and state governments, the Court considered the abrogation of Tribal authority necessary in light of the State's \\"considerable\\" interest in effectuating searches on Indian-fee land.

The inauguration marked the commencement of the second four-year term of Andrew Jackson as President and the only four-year term of Martin Van Buren as Vice President. When arriving at the east front of the capitol for the inauguration, John Peter Van Ness, the Mayor of Washington, and members of the Council of Corporation greeted Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren and helped escort these men to the House of Chamber prior to the commencement of the swearing of oath. At 12:00, Chief Justice John Marshall swore in Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren into their respective offices in the House of Chamber, unlike the previous presidential inauguration that was held in the East Portico of the United States Capitol, as a result of the snowy grounds and the weather that reached about 29¬∫F. In addition to that, Andrew Jackson's poor health status at the time of the inauguration essentially forced the swearing in of the oath of office to be held inside the House of Chamber. People who attended the inauguration in the House of Chamber include the following: Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, Senators, Foreign Ministers, Andrew Jackson Donelson, and members of the House of Representatives, to name a few. Andrew Jackson walked up and took the seat of the Speaker of the House and after pauses in cheers from the crowds, Andrew Jackson stood up and was sworn into office of the President of the United States, while having Mr. Donelson, who was Andrew Jackson's private secretary, on his right with Martin Van Buren on his left. This inauguration marked the last and ninth time that Chief Justice John Marshall administered the oath of office of President of the United States. Soon after taking the oath of office, President Andrew Jackson presented his inaugural speech unto the multitudes of people that were in the Hall of the House of Representatives. Although Andrew Jackson made a speech, his Vice-President did not make a speech for the Inauguration. In his Inaugural Speech, Andrew Jackson stated that he was humbled and honored by being re-elected for President of the United States and stated that he would make a sincere attempt to improve the lives of the American people. In addition to these remarks, Jackson has please to state that the United States was currently not having any ongoing conflicts with nations around the world. Jackson also stressed out the importance of having a strong, unified union within all 24 states and having a cooperative state and federal government. After Jackson's inaugural speech, there were two United States presidential inaugural balls. These inauguration made history in the sense that this was the first time in United States history when there was more than one inaugural ball. One the balls was held at Central Masonic Hall and the other was held at Carusi's. Although Andrew Jackson was a Democrat, Boston Republicans suggested that they were supporting the newly re- inaugurated President by having 50-gun salutes at 9:00 a.m. and at 12:00 p.m. under the direction of Captain Hoppin on the day of inauguration.  Inaugural Speech  Fellow-Citizens: The will of the American people, expressed through their unsolicited suffrages, calls me before you to pass through the solemnities preparatory to taking upon myself the duties of President of the United States for another term. For their approbation of my public conduct through a period which has not been without its difficulties, and for this renewed expression of their confidence in my good intentions, I am at a loss for terms adequate to the expression of my gratitude. It shall be displayed to the extent of my humble abilities in continued efforts so to administer the Government as to preserve their liberty and promote their happiness. So many events have occurred within the last four years which have necessarily called forthsometimes under circumstances the most delicate and painfulmy views of the principles and policy which ought to be pursued by the General Government that I need on this occasion but allude to a few leading considerations connected with some of them. The foreign policy adopted by our Government soon after the formation of our present Constitution, and very generally pursued by successive Administrations, has been crowned with almost complete success, and has elevated our character among the nations of the earth. To do justice to all and to submit to wrong from none has been during my Administration its governing maxim, and so happy have been its results that we are not only at peace with all the world, but have few causes of controversy, and those of minor importance, remaining unadjusted. In the domestic policy of this Government there are two objects which especially deserve the attention of the people and their representatives, and which have been and will continue to be the subjects of my increasing solicitude. They are the preservation of the rights of the several States and the integrity of the Union. These great objects are necessarily connected, and can only be attained by an enlightened exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate sphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally expressed. To this end it becomes the duty of all to yield a ready and patriotic submission to the laws constitutionally enacted and thereby promote and strengthen a proper confidence in those institutions of the several States and of the United States which the people themselves have ordained for their own government. My experience in public concerns and the observation of a life somewhat advanced confirm the opinions long since imbibed by me, that the destruction of our State governments or the annihilation of their control over the local concerns of the people would lead directly to revolution and anarchy, and finally to despotism and military domination. In proportion, therefore, as the General Government encroaches upon the rights of the States, in the same proportion does it impair its own power and detract from its ability to fulfill the purposes of its creation. Solemnly impressed with these considerations, my countrymen will ever find me ready to exercise my constitutional powers in arresting measures which may directly or indirectly encroach upon the rights of the States or tend to consolidate all political power in the General Government. But of equal and, indeed of incalculable, importance is the union of these States, and the sacred duty of all to contribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the General Government in the exercise of its just powers. You have been wisely admonished to \\"accustom yourselves to think and speak of the Union as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity, watching for its preservation with Jealous anxiety, discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of any attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.\\" Without union our independence and liberty would never have been achieved; without union they never can be maintained. Divided into twenty-four, or even a smaller number, of separate communities, we shall see our internal trade burdened with numberless restraints and exactions; communication between distant points and sections obstructed or cut off; our sons made soldiers to deluge with blood the fields they now till in peace; the mass of our people borne down and impoverished by taxes to support armies and navies, and military leaders at the head of their victorious legions becoming our lawgivers and judges. The loss of liberty, of all good government, of peace, plenty, and happiness, must inevitably follow a dissolution of the Union. In supporting it, therefore, we support all that is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist. The time at which I stand before you is full of interest. The eyes of all nations are fixed on our Republic. The event of the existing crisis will be decisive in the opinion of mankind of the practicability of our federal system of government. Great is the stake placed in our hands; great is the responsibility which must rest upon the people of the United States. Let us realize the importance of the attitude in which we stand before the world. Let us exercise forbearance and firmness. Let us extricate our country from the dangers which surround it and learn wisdom from the lessons they inculcate. Deeply impressed with the truth of these observations, and under the obligation of that solemn oath which I am about to take, I shall continue to exert all my faculties to maintain the just powers of the Constitution and to transmit unimpaired to posterity the blessings of our Federal Union. At the same time, it will be my aim to inculcate by my official acts the necessity of exercising by the General Government those powers only that are clearly delegated; to encourage simplicity and economy in the expenditures of the Government; to raise no more money from the people than may be requisite for these objects, and in a manner that will best promote the interests of all classes of the community and of all portions of the Union. Constantly bearing in mind that in entering into society \\"individuals must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest,\\" it will be my desire so to discharge my duties as to foster with our brethren in all parts of the country a spirit of liberal concession and compromise, and, by reconciling our fellow-citizens to those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably make for the preservation of a greater good, to recommend our invaluable Government and Union to the confidence and affections of the American people. Finally, it is my most fervent prayer to that Almighty Being before whom I now stand, and who has kept us in His hands from the infancy of our Republic to the present day, that He will so overrule all my intentions and actions and inspire the hearts of my fellow-citizens that we may be preserved from dangers of all kinds and continue forever a united and happy people. ‚ÄìAndrew Jackson See also *Presidency of Andrew Jackson *First inauguration of Andrew Jackson *1832 United States presidential election *Oath of office of the President of the United States References External links *More documents from the Library of Congress *Text of Jackson's Second Inaugural Address United States presidential inaugurations Presidency of Andrew Jackson 1833 in Washington, D.C. 1833 in American politics March 1833 events  ","title":"Second inauguration of Andrew Jackson"},{"id":"21211980","text":"John Relly Beard (4 August 1800 ‚Äì 22 November 1876) was an English Unitarian minister, schoolmaster, university lecturer, and translator who co-founded Unitarian College Manchester and wrote more than thirty books. Life He was born in Portsmouth on 4 August 1800, the first child of a tradesman, John Beard, and his wife Ann Paine. After attending Portsmouth Grammar School and a brief period in a French boarding-school, he joined Manchester College, York in 1820 and studied under Charles Wellbeloved, a pioneering translator of the Old Testament. One of his fellow students there was William Gaskell (whose wife Elizabeth became the famous novelist) and they remained lifelong friends. After his training Beard became a Unitarian minister at Greengate, Salford in 1825. Alongside his ministry, he ran a school which was so successful that he built a house to accommodate it. Although he closed it in 1849 to give his attention to other matters, he remained deeply interested in education. In 1842 his congregation migrated to Bridge Street, Strangeways, Manchester, and Beard remained their minister until 1864, when he moved to Sale, Cheshire. During this time he and William Gaskell, who was living in nearby Knutsford, worked to establish the Unitarian Home Missionary Board, which became Unitarian College Manchester, of which they were the co-founders and the first two Principals. He retired in 1874 and died aged 76 on 22 November 1876, at the Meadows, Ashton upon Mersey. Children Beard and his wife Mary (n√©e Barnes (1802‚Äì87)) had ten children. To mention only the best known of their descendants: their eldest son, Charles Beard (1827‚Äì88), also became a Unitarian minister, writer and educator; their youngest son, James Rait Beard (1843‚Äì1917), although engaged in business in Manchester, was active in supporting Unitarian College Manchester: he served as its Treasurer 1886‚Äì1914 and President 1900‚Äì01 and 1904‚Äì05; their eldest daughter Sarah (1831‚Äì1922) married John Dendy (1828‚Äì94) and their children included: John Dendy OBE (1852‚Äì1924); Mary Dendy, the pioneer of residential schools for mentally handicapped people; the social reformer Helen Bosanquet; and the biologist Arthur Dendy. Works Beard published popular education manuals, theological works and, as both an editor and a journalist, engaged in vigorous Unitarian propaganda. He is best remembered for The Life of Toussaint L'Ouverture (1853) and several reference volumes on a variety of topics. He wrote in simple language and attempted to translate complicated foreign affairs‚Äîsuch as the Haitian struggle for independence‚Äîinto terms that every reader could understand. Beard's biography of Toussaint Louverture was first published in London on the fiftieth anniversary of Toussaint L'Ouverture's death. Ten years later, in 1863, Boston publishers reissued Beard's biography, replacing a brief history of Haiti's fight for independence after L'Ouverture's exile with the first English translation of a thirty-five page autobiography written by L'Ouverture and other related documents, including a transcript of his post- mortem examination. Beard's biography remained the authoritative English- language history of L'Ouverture's life until the late twentieth century. In explaining his reasons for writing about L'Ouverture, Beard frankly admits in the 1853 volume that he does so in order to \\"supply the clearest evidence that there is no insuperable barrier between the light and the dark-coloured tribes of our common human species.\\" Throughout the text, Beard compares L'Ouverture to famously successful white generals and argues for L'Ouverture's supremacy. L'Ouverture is superior to George Washington, Beard writes, because L'Ouverture could have seized absolute power more easily than Washington, and \\"[t]he greater the opportunity the greater the temptation; nor can he be accounted the inferior man who overcame in the severer trial.\\" Similarly, Beard argues that L'Ouverture is a better man than Napoleon Bonaparte because \\"the two differed in that which is the dividing line between the happy and the wretched; for while, with Bonaparte, God was a name, with Toussaint L'Ouverture, God was at once the sole reality and the sovereign good.\\" For Beard, L'Ouverture's ultimate failure to liberate Haiti and his untimely death are the product of unfortunate circumstances‚Äînot an indictment of his character or leadership abilities.

In 2009, Reckless Sidekick Productions began publishing an ongoing video podcast series starring Gleason and Cimino in, generally, a roundtable discussion with guests covering a specific pop-culture topic each installment. The podcasts 15 to 30 minutes. Comic book In April 2012, Reckless Sidekick Productions released the \\"Hero Envy\\" comic book. Written by Keith Gleason with added dialogue from Efrain Martinez and story assistance from John Cimino, the comic book is a three-part miniseries set in the universe established in the \\"Hero Envy\\" webisodes. A trade paperback compilation was released in April 2013. The story expands on the characters' backgrounds and follows them on a quest for four mystical objects that need to be used against villain El Moco-Conpan. The comic also adds an otherworldly character U-Toob, a parody of Marvel Comics' Uatu the Watcher. who guides the characters throughout the story. The comic includes a second story that explains the origin of El Diablo, an imaginary friend who lives in the character J.D.'s head. Characters J.D. Fields - Played by John Cimino The rambunctious and raging hormone who sometimes doesn't know if he's 3 or 30 (and this usually happens at the expense of others)! Cares little for time, law and order, for those things mean nothing in \\"J.D. World.\\" Even though he's loath to admit it, J.D. needs his best friend Wally and this sometimes comes at a huge price. An incorrigible rebel that lives for babes, beers, cartoons, and chaos, and not necessarily in that order. In an alternate dimension J.D. lives with The Toy Dealer and seems to tolerate Dekker a little more than usual (even asking him to become a roommate). He likes to change his hats depending on the situations. Dekker - Played by Keith Gleason Works the counter for the local comic shop \\"Fly on the Wall Comics.\\" Dekker has been friends with Wally for over 10 years and they bonded over an issue of Hellboy. A loner who is a little \\"off\\" due to his militant love for blood, guts, and horror. Dekker is also up on all internet geek news because he is on eBay everyday and writing hate e-mails to studios for re-making his favorite horror movies. Recently, Dekker stole J.B.'s reality hopping razor for fun but now finds himself trapped in a parallel universe that he is trying to escape from. Wallace North - Played by Mike Hopta The level-headed, kind, yet sometimes gullible guy who looks for the best in everyone and in any situation. Think Charlie Brown trying to \\"right the wrong\\" like his hero Hal Jordan (Green Lantern) while maintaining his sanity in a world lost. Wally tries to live as normal of a life as possible by balancing a riled up J.D. and trying to \\"get it right\\" with his on and off again girlfriend Brooke. Known for his high-speed-joystick-trigger-fingers and an almost uncanny dedication to his comicbook heroes. Orson H. Cochrane - Played by Kurt Loether The lovable, somewhat-robotic science fiction companion to Wally. Orson still lives at home with his mother (but he would contend it's the bridge of the USS Enterprise). Wally and Orson met in line waiting for \\"Return of the Jedi\\" tickets 20 years ago (oddly enough he still hasn't stopped complaining about the Ewoks). His extensive robotic Sci-fi techno babble can drive even the most balanced Jedi to the dark side. Orson's relationship with J.D. is a bit shakey because J.D. is very territorial when it comes to all things Wally.

Unfortunately, depression is a common symptom found in patients with schizophrenia and can fly under the radar for years before others become aware of its presence in a patient. However, very little research has been done on the subject, meaning there are few answers to how it should be systematically diagnosed, treated, or what course the illness will take. Some scientists would entirely deny the existence of post- schizophrenic depression, insisting it is a phase in schizophrenia as a whole. As of late, post-schizophrenic depression has become officially recognized as a syndrome and is considered a sub-type of schizophrenia.  Symptoms  Because the nature of acute schizophrenia is similar to depression, it is difficult to differentiate normal levels of depression in patients with schizophrenia from depressive levels in post-schizophrenic depression. \\"Prominent subjectively low mood, suggesting depression, and prominent blunting of affect, suggesting negative symptoms, are the two features which are most helpful in differentiating [schizophrenia and depression].\\" A number of researchers believe that depression is actually a symptom of schizophrenia that has been hidden by the psychosis. However, symptoms usually arise after the first psychotic episodes if they will arise at all. Officially, diagnosing post-schizophrenia depression in a patient requires for the patient to be experiencing a depressive episode of either short or long term following the overcoming of schizophrenia. The patient must still demonstrate some schizophrenic symptoms but those symptoms must no longer be the focus of the illness. Typically, the depressive symptoms are not severe enough to be classified as a severe depressive episode. Formally, diagnosis entails the patient having had schizophrenia within the past year, a number of schizophrenic symptoms, and depression being present for two weeks or more. Mild schizophrenic signs may be withdrawing socially, agitation or hostility, and irregular sleep such as in the case of insomnia and hypersomnia.  Causes  There is no clear cause to how certain patients with schizophrenia develop post-schizophrenic depression while others may surpass this stage. However, there are a few theories as to possible causes. Those suffering from post- schizophrenic depression often suffer from social isolation due to their illness, which may increase depression levels. There is strong evidence of stigma-related isolation against those suffering from mental illnesses in a variety of societies, especially those with schizophrenia as they are often viewed as dangerous and unpredictable. Because of this isolation and studies linking social isolation and depression, it is possible that patients under these stigmas eventually develop post-schizophrenic depression. Depression in patients with schizophrenia may also be caused by substance abuse, which is fairly common among those suffering from schizophrenia, as depressants such as alcohol and cannabis can relax the patient. Furthermore, with what little information is currently known about post-schizophrenic depression, the onset may be caused by not giving patients with schizophrenia antipsychotic medications. After being taken off of antipsychotic medication, schizophrenic patients' antidepressant medication had to be increased, while those under antipsychotic medication reported suffering fewer depressive symptoms, further giving reason to believe that a lack of antipsychotic medication in earlier stages of schizophrenia may lead to post-schizophrenic depression. However, some psychology professionals still push for the reduction of neuroleptic drugs, as there is a popular belief that post-schizophrenic depression is caused by neuroleptic treatment. Therapists are also believed to engage the depression in people with schizophrenia, having given too much psychotherapy after the patient had overcome their schizophrenic symptoms. Schizophrenia itself should not be overlooked as a key player in causing post-schizophrenic depression, though. A study done over a two-year time period shadowing patients with schizophrenia and monitoring their depression was unable to locate possible triggers such as the ones previously listed, so it is possible the nature of schizophrenia itself is the primary cause of post-schizophrenic depression.  Suicide  Those suffering from post-schizophrenic depression are also commonly at risk for suicidal tendencies. There is a trend correlated between suicide and post-schizophrenic depression according to Mulholland and Cooper's research in \\"The Symptoms of Depression in Schizophrenia and its Management.\\" Furthermore, depression and schizophrenia have both been studied individually to try to determine if there is a correlation, and research has indicated that there is a very strong tendency for people with depression or schizophrenia to attempt suicide. Statistically, out of all patients suffering from schizophrenia, \\"10%...commit suicide. Depressed patients with schizophrenia are at a particularly high risk for suicide the first few months after diagnosis and after hospital discharge.\\" Risk factors increasing the chance of suicide are, from highest to lowest, previous depressive orders, previous suicide attempts, drug abuse, and several other factors. Surprisingly, the suicide risk actually decreased with the presence of hallucinations. The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders officially recognizes suicide as being a prominent aspect of post- schizophrenic depression. Because of this drastic increase in suicide, it can be difficult to study post-schizophrenic depression as many of its victims tragically take their own lives.  Treatment  For a number of years, scholars debated amongst themselves whether or not antipsychotic drugs had a tendency to increase depression or simply help the patient manage their mental illness. However, conclusive evidence points to antipsychotic drugs actually helping patients with their depression while simultaneously assisting in the suppression of schizophrenic episodes. Specifically risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and L-sulpiride have done the best in drug trials pertaining to people with schizophrenia. Along with antipsychotic drugs, post-schizophrenic patients may receive antidepressants to actively treat the depression. Drugs are certainly not the only answer, though. At the base of both depression and schizophrenia, social withdrawal is a shared symptom between the two. People suffering from schizophrenia require a strong support system to be healthy, just as is the case with the rest the human population. The opportunity to become a working citizen is another way to ward off depression in patients with schizophrenia, helping them create social ties and a feeling of accomplishment.

This inauguration marked the commencement of the only term of John Tyler (a partial term of ) as President. William Cranch, Chief Judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of the D.C., administered the presidential oath of office to Tyler. This was the first non-scheduled, extraordinary inauguration to ever take place in American history. Background On March 26, 1841, President Harrison came down with a cold, then pneumonia and pleurisy set in. It was believed that his illness was directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration on March 4; however, Harrison's illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event. On April 1, Secretary of State Daniel Webster sent word of Harrison's illness to Tyler, who was at his home in Williamsburg, Virginia. Two days later, Richmond attorney James Lyons wrote with the news that the president had taken a turn for the worse, remarking that \\"I shall not be surprised to hear by tomorrow's mail that Gen'l Harrison is no more.\\" Tyler determined not to travel to Washington, not wanting to appear unseemly in anticipating the president's death. At dawn on April 5, Webster's son Fletcher, Chief Clerk of the State Department, arrived at Tyler's plantation with a letter from Webster, informing the new president of Harrison's death the morning before. Harrison's death from Fletcher Webster April 4‚Äì6, 1841 : President Tyler immediately packed a bag & with one of his sons, headed towards Washington via every form of conveyance then available (horse, steamboat, and train), arriving early in the morning of April 6. He was greeted by a bipartisan group of dignitaries, including the entire Cabinet. There followed a heated discussion as to what procedural steps to take in the aftermath of Harrison's death. While several sitting Presidents had experienced illness, none had previously died while in office. Some cabinet members held that no formal actions needed to be taken, as Tyler's right to take over as Acting President was virtually undisputed. During Harrison's illness, the executive branch was ruled by majority vote of cabinet officials. Tyler discontinued this practice, contending that taking the oath of office would ensure his authority as the tenth president of the United States. Taking oath of office On April 6, 1841, Chief Judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of the D.C.William Cranch administered the oath to President Tyler at the lobby in the Brown's Indian Queen Hotel, making this the first extraordinary presidential inauguration in history. On April 9, Tyler published an inaugural message to a special session of Congress that Harrison had called. Later presidents would do the same under similar circumstances. Establishing precedent Tyler's defense of his title was unyielding. Letters addressed to the ‚Äúvice president‚Äù or ‚Äúacting president‚Äù were returned unopened. The ‚ÄúTyler precedent‚Äù subsequently endured through the next seven presidential deaths, four after assassinations, until it was codified in 1967 when the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified.

This was the 26th inauguration and marked the commencement of the only four-year term of Benjamin Harrison as President and Levi P. Morton as Vice President. Chief Justice Melville Fuller administered the presidential oath of office as rain poured down. Harrison was 5'6\\" tall, he was only slightly taller than James Madison, the shortest president, but much heavier; he was the fourth (and last) president to sport a full beard. Harrison's inauguration ceremony took place during a rainstorm in Washington D.C. Outgoing president Grover Cleveland attended the ceremony and held an umbrella over Harrison's head as he took the oath of office. His speech was brief ‚Äì half as long as that of his grandfather, William Henry Harrison, whose speech holds the record for the longest inaugural address of a U.S. president. In his speech, Benjamin Harrison credited the nation's growth to the influences of education and religion, urged the cotton states and mining territories to attain the industrial proportions of the eastern states and promised a protective tariff. Concerning commerce, he said, \\"If our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal obligations and duties, they would have less call to complain of the limitations of their rights or of interference with their operations.\\" Harrison also urged early statehood for the territories and advocated pensions for veterans, a statement that was met with enthusiastic applause. In foreign affairs, Harrison reaffirmed the Monroe Doctrine as a mainstay of foreign policy, while urging modernization of the Navy and a merchant marine force. He gave his commitment to international peace through noninterference in the affairs of foreign governments. John Philip Sousa's Marine Band played at the Inaugural Ball inside the Pension Building with a large crowd attending. After moving into the White House, Harrison noted, quite prophetically, \\"There is only a door ‚Äì one that is never locked ‚Äì between the president's office and what are not very accurately called his private apartments. There should be an executive office building, not too far away, but wholly distinct from the dwelling house.

Controllerism is also a nod to traditional musicianship and instrumental-ism paired with modern computer sequencing software such as Ableton Live and Native Instruments Traktor. However a working knowledge of scales and chords is not necessarily required as the performers typically focus their efforts more on sequencing events, software effect and instrument manipulations using buttons, knobs, faders, keys, foot switches and pedals than on instrumental notes played in real time. With recent developments in music technology, particularly in software instruments, a USB MIDI controller enables musicians almost unlimited possibilities to control a wide variety of sound types.https://usbmidicontrollers.com/welcome Birth of the term  In 2005, Moldover and Dj Shakey (Julie Covello) met at the Burning Man Festival at a camp where Moldover was leading an Ableton Live workshop. Shakey approached Moldover after the class and they exchanged contact information, bonding over their ideas about performing with computers and controllers. When they returned to New York where they lived, Shakey, an event producer, proposed to Moldover that they start a party for Ableton Live performers. They created The Warper Party, a monthly artist showcase which was quickly expanded to include all electronic musicians pushing the boundaries of live performance. The event was popular and became a place for like-minded performers to meet, network, experiment, and build community. Not long afterwards, Shakey became Moldover's manager. She suggested that, since there was no catchy name for what he or their Warper community members were doing, that they come up with one to make marketing his talents easier. After some brainstorming and debating between them, the name \\"Controllerism\\" was chosen. Shakey believed presenting Controllerism to the world in print would be beneficial to Moldover as an artist, Moldover reached out to his contact Ean Golden from Remix Magazine and proposed they write an article about it. The article \\"Music Maneuvers: Discover the Digital Turntablism Concept, Controllerism, Compliments of Moldover\\" appeared in the October 2007 issue of Remix magazine. Styles Controllerism, like turntablism, typically involves complex musical routines using the controller in the manner of a musical instrument rather than a simple mixer. Some DJs use turntables and controllers simultaneously, blending the two technique. Live PA performers often incorporate instruments or vocals. Software and equipment File:Pioneer DDJ-SB DJ Controller - a chance for me to monkey with Serato - Eva Egolf's EDM workshop (by Ethan Hein).jpgA DJ controller with jog wheels emulating decks File:Novation_Launchpad.jpgA grid-based button controller File:NI_Maschine_%28closeup%29.jpgA drum pad controller Since controllerism depends on a physical controller and a software interface, there is considerable uniqueness with equipment and personal styles among controllerists. There are three main classes of software used by controllerists: DAWs which have special functionality aimed at live performance, such as Ableton Live, sample-centered music software such as Maschine by Native Instruments, and DJ programs which have a powerful sample player/looper such as Native Instruments Traktor with its \\"remix decks\\" feature. Popular software for controllerists includes Ableton Live,http://www.controllerism.com/download-the-7gb-set-that-coined- controllerism Native Instruments Traktor and Maschine,http://www.controllerism.com/carl-rag-maschine-performance Akai MPC,https://welovefingerdrumming.com/araabmuzik-mpc-dubstep-performance Atomix Virtual DJ, Serato Scratch Live and Max. There are alternate platforms that are less common, including FL Studio, Bitwig, Torq, and Deckadance. Hardware typically consists of a physical controller, most often a MIDI or Human interface device, often resembling a scaled-down CDJ setup (albeit, without hardware CD players) or a pad-controller resembling the traditional Akai MPC; a newer class of controllers is represented by grid-based button controllers such as the Novation Launchpad. Some include built-in sound card interfaces and others rely on the PC's internal sound setup or make use of a breakout box with a sound card. Some makers of controllers include Akai Professional, Numark Industries, Native Instruments, Novation, Vestax, Livid Instruments, Keith McMillen, Denon, Monome. Some DJ CD Players, such as the Pioneer Corporation CDJ800 and Numark MixDeck can also function as controllers. Older controllers occasionally used standard MIDI connectors, most controllers today are USB-based. Some controllers depart from the traditional two-deck system and incorporate four decks, effects sections, or do away with the traditional deck/mixer setup altogether,http://controllers.cc/ such as button grid controllers (originally intended to launch Ableton Live clips),http://www.controllerism.com/m4sonic-hits-it-big-first-ultra-music- release-also-rumors drum pads MPC-style controllers (originally used for finger-drumming),http://www.controllerism.com/monday-video-jeremy-ellis-at- forward-fest-2012 touch-screen interfaces,http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/kaossilator_pro_plus/ arcade buttonshttp://www.djtechtools.com/2014/10/20/routine-tim-murray-i-have-spoken- on-midi-fighter-3d-twister/ and other devices. Many DJs use turntables and CDJs with timecode records to utilize the device in a similar manner as a controller. The software that interprets the timecode vinyl is called vinyl emulation software. Custom controllers Matt Moldover made custom MIDI controllers in an attempt to make DJing an experience beyond that of simply two turntables and a mixer. As of 2012, he's made the design and programming files of his Mojo MIDI controller open-source, along with instructions on how to build it.http://www.controllerism.com/the-mojo-now-open-source In this, he followed in the footsteps of English DJ Sasha, who had a custom controller built back in 2005, and indeed a very long tradition stretching all the way back to Grandmaster Flash, who in the 1970s used to rewire his mixers by hand, or even build them, using raw materials he found in junkyards. Events As controllerism gains acceptance in the DJ World and the club scenes, many controllerists have begun to collaborate and compete in the same manner that turntablists have been doing for many years in events such as in the DMC Championship. One of the first events of this sort was the Midi Fight Club, a tour of Controllerist and Controllerist/Turntablist DJs including such notables as DJ Shiftee, DJ Craze, Ean Golden, Miami's The Overthrow, Ed Paris, DJ Dystopic, DJ Velz, Detroit's Edison, Ryan Start, and Hedgehog.

The basic colour is grey which darkens towards the posterior and the body is liberally spotted with white. There is a band of white just behind the eye stretching from the operculum to the nape of the neck. Another white band encircles the fish just behind the yellow pelvic fins. The other fins are dark coloured except for the rather small caudal fin which is half pale yellow and half black. The dorsal fin has 9 spines and 27 to 30 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 23 to 26 rays and the pectoral fin has 17 to 20 rays. The fish grows to a maximum length of 26 cm (10 in).Acanthurus guttatus, Forster 1801: Whitespotted Surgeonfish USGS. Retrieved 2012-02-27. Distribution and habitat The whitespotted surgeonfish is found in shallow water in the Indo-Pacific. Its native range extends from Mauritius to southern Japan, Indonesia and northern Australia but in 2003, it was observed off the coast of Florida in the vicinity of Palm Beach. Its main habitat is exposed reefs and rocky shores where it occurs in groups. Its spots may provide camouflage in the churned up, bubble-filled water. Biology The whitespotted surgeonfish feeds on filamentous algae and calcareous algae. It is considered to form an important link between algae, the primary producers in the ocean, and the detrital food web in the Pacific Ocean. In American Samoa, breeding takes place all year round with eggs being deposited in drainage channels in the reef at dusk.

It belongs to the Byzantine text-type as one of its textual families, it is one of the primary early families of the Byzantine text-type. The name of the family came from the symbol of Codex Basilensis, the lead manuscript of the family, which is designated by symbol E (von Soden's Ki).  Description  Hermann von Soden discovered the family and designated it with symbol Ki. According to him it is one of the earliest families of the Byzantine text-type, it is a result of recension made by Lucian of Antioch.Hermann von Soden, Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer √§ltesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte, Verlag von Arthur Glaue, Berlin 1902-1910, p. 718. To this family Soden included, as the leading members of it, manuscripts: Codex Boreelianus (F), Codex Seidelianus I (G), and Codex Seidelianus II (H).F. Wisse, Family E and the Profile Method, Biblica 51, (1970), pp. 68, 75 Codex Seidelianus I seems slightly less Byzantine than the rest, and Codex Basilensis seems closer to the basic form of the Byzantine text. Jacob Greelings includes to this family variants from Codex Vaticanus 354, Codex Mosquensis II, minuscules 44, 65, 98, 219, and 422. The Gothic Version made by Wulfila stays with close relationship to this Byzantine sub-family.Bruce M. Metzger, The Early Versions of the New Testament, Clarendon Press Oxford 1977, p. 385. Greelings classified in this group Codex Nanianus (U), but Frederik Wisse excluded U from this group while suggesting 271 should be added.F. Wisse, Family E, p. 75 Greelings assigned manuscripts E, F, G, H as a core members of the group. Unfortunately all these manuscripts have survived in a fragmentary condition, it makes classification and restoration the text of the family more difficult. According to Claremont Profile Method in the three test chapters of the Gospel of Luke, manuscripts E, F, G, H did not have sufficient consistency to demonstrate its existence as an independent textual group. Wisse included them to the textual family Kx. Family e (Soden's Ki) becomes Wisse's textual cluster Œ©, an early form of Kx. Wisse confirmed statement of Soden that it is an early form of Kx.Frederik Wisse, The profile method for the classification and evaluation of manuscript evidence, as Applied to the Continuous Greek Text of the Gospel of Luke, William B. Eerdmans Publishing, (Grand Rapids, 1982), p. 95 But Wisse used small sample size (three chapters of Luke), based on the age alone, it appears that Ki is independent of Kx.

This was the 16th inauguration and marked the commencement of the only four- year term of both Zachary Taylor as President and Millard Fillmore as Vice President. Taylor died into this term, and Fillmore succeeded to the presidency. The presidential oath of office was administered by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. Inauguration Day started off being cloudy with snow flurries, but turned to heavy snow during the inaugural balls. Inaugural festivities Three inaugural balls were held later that day. To accommodate the large numbers of guests anticipated to be at one of them, a temporary wooden building was built in the Judiciary Square plaza. The ticket price for the event was $10 cash; the menu included: terrapins, Charlotte Russe, oysters and Roman punch. The \\"presidency\\" of David Rice Atchison Due to the postponement of the swearing-in ceremony until March 5, various friends and colleagues of Senator David Atchison asserted that on March 4‚Äì5, 1849 he was acting president of the United States. They argued that, since both President James K. Polk and Vice President George Dallas ceased to hold their offices at noon on March 4, and since neither Taylor nor Fillmore had yet sworn their prescribed oath of office, both offices were vacant. As a result, they claimed, in accordance with the Presidential Succession Act of 1792, Atchison, by virtue of being the President pro tempore of the United States Senate, was the nation's acting chief executive during the interregnum. Historians, constitutional scholars and biographers all dismiss the claim.

At its dedication on October 3, 1960, the library contained a collection of 20,000 books, 17,000 manuscripts, more than fifty oil paintings, and 300 prints. Currently, the Lilly Library has 8.5 million manuscripts, 450,000 books, 60,000 comic books, 16,000 mini books, 35,000 puzzles, and 150,000 sheets of music. History Novus Atlas Sinensis by Martino Martini from the collection of Lilly Library The Lilly Library was founded in 1960 with the collection of Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., owner of Lilly Pharmaceuticals in Indianapolis. J.K. Lilly was a collector most of his life. From the mid-1920s until his death, he devoted a great deal of his leisure time to building his collections of books and manuscripts, works of art, coins, stamps, military miniatures, firearms and edged weapons, and nautical models. J. K. Lilly's collections of books and manuscripts, totaling more than 20,000 books and 17,000 manuscripts, together with more than fifty oil paintings and 300 prints, were given by the collector to Indiana University between 1954 and 1957. These materials form the foundation of the rare book and manuscript collections of the Lilly Library. The extent to which J. K. Lilly realized his collecting goals was summed up by Frederick B. Adams, Jr., at the dedication of the Lilly Library on October 3, 1960: \\"Mr. Lilly's books cover so many fields that it is difficult to believe that any one man's enthusiasm could encompass them all. It is equally astounding that he was able to acquire so many books of such scarcity and quality in the short space of 30 years. Money alone isn't the answer; diligence, courage, and imagination were also essential. The famous books in English and American literature, the books most influential in American life, the great works in the history of science and ideasall these are among the 20,000 Lilly books in this building.\\"Indiana University; Lilly Library - Accessed 2012-01-08 Collection Yale University's copy of the Dunlap broadside The library now contains approximately 450,000 books, 8.5 million manuscripts, 60,000 comic books, 16,000 mini books, 35,000 puzzles, and 150,000 pieces of sheet music.

The club was founded in 2002 and as of today it plays in the Russian championship between amateur football clubs, which is the fourth level of the Russian football league system. History =Amateur Football League= FC Zelenograd was founded in 2002. In the same year they made their debut in Amateur Football League. Their roster consisted mainly of graduates from Sport School ‚Ññ 112 \\"Sputnik\\", which as of today, still serves as FC Zelenograd Sport School. Their debut was rather disappointing as they could only finish in the 16th place from 21 places. A year after, FC Zelenograd was officially registered as a legal entity and once again participated in the AFL. In 2003 Zelenograd made an improvement as they finished in the 11th place. In 2004 and 2005, Zelenograd's performance improved and twice they ended up runners-up of the league. Finally, in 2006, the Zeleno-Belye won the Championship and thus won the right to participate in the Russian Second Division, ran by the Professional Football League. This meant that the club had to shift into a professional outfit and to reconstruct their home stadium, the Angstrem Stadium. =Russian Second Division= The club was successfully licensed to participate in the Second Division, and in their debut they ended in the 12th place. Zelenograd's stay in the Russian Second Division was a rather a disappointing one as the highest place that they ever achieved was the 11th place, with the worse being the 14th place, which signaled the end for the club as a professional one, even though technically the team was not relegated. =Return to the Amateur Football League= This is because, following the disappointing show in 2010, the Council of the club decided to withdraw the club from the Second Division and apply to participate in the recently formed Russian championship between amateur football clubs (III division), which replaced the Amateur Football League.

In October 2008 news broke in the small Caribbean island of Barbados that Hal Linton inked a million dollar deal with major record label Universal Motown, following in the footsteps of other Barbadian international recording artist Rihanna (Def Jam Recordings), Shontelle (Universal Motown), Livvi Franc (Jive Records) and Rupee (Atlantic). Biography Linton is the only child of divorced parents Cheryl Linton and David Linton, two classically trained musicians. From as early as age 2, Linton hit the stage with his mother. He was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist, and his parents from early on instilled the moral and religious values of the Bible in him and his everyday life. Linton's early schooling came at the Charles F. Broomes Memorial School and the Ellerslie Secondary School. He then went on to earn a Bachelor's degree in Design at Barbados Community College. Excelling in the field of Design, he was awarded a fully paid National Academic Scholarship in Barbados to gain his Masters at the Savannah School of Art & Design. However, Linton deferred the scholarship at the urging of his former music manager Teneille Doyle to pursue a career in music and entertainment. Career In 2005, as part of the internship program for his BA in Design, Hal went to work at CRS Music Studio. It was there that his creativity excelled leading him into the production of his self produced independent album Spirit:Life:Love, released in 2006. The first single, \\"Cardiac Arrest\\", went on to characterize Linton to Barbados and the rest of the Caribbean region as the soul prince of the Caribbean. Likened to musical legends Marvin Gaye, Prince, and even D'Angelo, he was nominated for eight awards at the 2007 Barbados Music Awards where he won four: Best New Artist, Song of the Year, R&B; Song of the Year, and Songwriter of the Year. Soon afterward he made his debut live performance at the Barbados Jazz Festival to rave reviews. > ..he was inspired by his best friend Brandye Warner.Soul newcomer Hal Linton > ‚Ä¶ really stole the show. At times, recalling the torched magic of Bilal or > the burly heat of Omar, the fresh-faced Linton demonstrated the island's > burgeoning R&B; scene with infectious originals, such as the driving \\"Shake > It Off\\" and his regional hit single, \\"Cardiac Arrest.\\" But it was his > ragamuffin makeover of Al Green's \\"Let's Stay Together\\" that sent the most > chills down the enthusiastic audience's back. ‚Äì John Murph (2007) BET After hearing such rave reviews, the production company Syndicated Rhythm Entertainment (SRP Records), run by Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers and responsible for Rihanna, Shontelle, and The Urgency, put a deal on the table for the young artist in January 2007. Opting not to work with the production company at that time, Linton moved to the USA with his manager at the time, Teneille Doyle, who secured a spot on the Heineken Red Star Soul tour for him. Although they suffered many disappointments and setbacks, the duo persevered. In September 2007, the Government of Barbados, through Invest Barbados, a division responsible for the export and development of culture, made a large financial commitment to the Linton project to assist in securing him a recording deal and promote his full export potential. This was the first time the Barbados Government had made such a commitment to any artist. It was through that funding that Linton showcased around the USA, worked with various producers, and met music business executives. By May 2008, Linton and Doyle had three production deals on the table, including another offer from SRP Productions whom they later signed to. By July 2008, they had captured the interest of Universal Motown's President Sylvia Rhone, who signed him. While at Motown Linton released three singles: \\"She's Dangerous\\", \\"Southern Hospitality\\", and \\"Mind Control\\", which collectively earned him over a half a million YouTube views. In 2009, Linton made his television debut as one of the featured artists on the BET show Grey Goose Rising Icons. The world of sports came calling next, when he was invited to perform at the 2009 NFL Thanksgiving Day Motown 50th Anniversary Tribute Halftime Show in Detroit. Linton truly had a passion for performing live, and toured extensively throughout the USA on such tickets as The Budweiser Super Fest, Essence Music Festival, Heineken Red Star Soul Tour, and Lexus Soul Stage. He also hit the road with acts including but not limited to John Legend, Estelle, Ryan Leslie, Fantasia, Solange, K.Michelle, and India Arie. 2011, Linton inked a major deal with the worldwide publishing conglomerate BMG, where he continues to work with contemporary award-winning producers, writers, and artists. These include Jerry Wonda, Salaam Remi, Wyclef Jean, Shontelle, Mary J. Blige, Melanie Fiona, Robin Thicke, Rico Love, Rockwilder, Dre & Vidal, Billy Mann Kwame, Stereotypes, Omen, D. Bunetta, Jim Jonsin, Chrisette Michele, Jessy Wilson, and Gourdan Banks, among others.

History At the beginning of the 20th century, together with the struggle for the Ukrainian statehood, the movement for the autocephality of UOC began in Ukraine. = From Ukrainian Orthodox Church = Metropolitan Dionysius was elevated into the Bishop dignity in 1913 by Gregorios IV, the Patriarch of Antioch, who had the ordination in the lineage of Apostle Peter. In 1932, Metropolitan Dionisius ordained Metropolitan Polycarp (Sikorsky) and in 1942 appointed him to the Nazi-occupied Ukraine for the renewing of UAOC and ordination of new bishops. Thus, all the hierarchy of UAOC in 1942 received the canonical ordinations of Bishops in the lineage of Apostle Peter. Among the ordained into Bishops were the deceased Patriarch Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) and Metropolitan Hryhoriy Ohiychuk. After the World War II in 1945 the UAOC in Ukraine was liquidated by the Soviet power. Some Bishops and the clergy of UAOC were delivered to the German concentration camps and some managed to emigrate to Europe and America, where they continued their church life and built the churches of UAOC. = UAOC in independent Ukraine = In 1990 after the celebration of the 1000-anniversary of Baptism of Rus in Ukraine, the new movement for rebirth of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church began. It was initiated by Metropolitan Jonh (Bodnarchuk), and in the central Ukraine, in April 1990 the rebirth of the UAOC was initiated by archpriest Oleh Koulik, who organized about 200 religious communities of the UAOC being the Metropolitan administrator for Khmelnytskyi, Vinnytsa and Zhytomyr regions. In 1990, on June 5‚Äì6, the All-Ukrainian Orthodox Council was held in Kyiv where more than 700 delegates from the whole Ukraine took part, among them there were 7 bishops and more than 200 priests. The Council declared the fact of establishing the UAOC and elected Metropolitan Mstyslav (Skrypnyk), who had the episcopal lineage from Polish Orthodox Church, to be the Patriarch of Kyiv and all Ukraine. On 2 October 1990 the authorities of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic registered the UAOC in the official order. And on 18 November 1990 in St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, Metropolitan Mstyslav was enthroned into the Patriarch of Kyiv and All Ukraine. Since that time, Patriarch Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) had not only become the first Patriarch but he united the UAOC in Ukraine with the UAOC in the US and the Diaspora that had the lineage from Polish Orthodox Church. Since that time the hierarchs and priesthood of the UOC in the USA began to come to Ukraine, officiate in Ukrainian temples, to take part in ordaining the priests. Patriarch Mstyslav together with Bishop of Washington Anthony (Shcherba) consecrated Anthony (Fialka) for bishop of Khmelnytskyi and Panteleimon (Romanovsky) for bishop of Dnipropetrovsk, but those canonically ordained Bishops passed to ROC. Since that time the canonical ordination lineage in the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church disappeared. On 25‚Äì26 June 1992, in Kyiv at the residence of Metropolitan Filaret, the betrayal of the UAO Church on the part of the Metropolitan administrator Anthony (Masendich) took place. He acted behind the back of Patriarch Mstyslav and all the clergy supporting the initiative of President Leonid Kravchuk as for the fake union of UAOC and ROC. Patriarch of the UAOC Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) did not accept this treason of the UAOC and appealed to the Ukrainian higher authorities and believers of the UAOC not to acknowledge this unification and to oppose this betrayal. But the higher authorities of Ukraine supported the Patriarch Filaret (Denysenko) and illegally handed down all the church property of the UAOC under Filaret Denysenko. On 11 June 1993 Patriarch of Kyiv and all Ukraine Mstyslav died. Before death, Patriarch considering himself and the UAOC betrayed declared his will that the UAOC couldn't have any relation to the former metropolitan of the ROC Filaret Denysenko who was defrocked by his mother Church ‚Äì ROC. In 1995, in two years after death of Patriarch Mstyslav, hierarchs of UAOC in the USA passed under the omophorion of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, to the fold of Mother-Church, breaking off the canonical branch that gave hope for the return to Ukraine of the apostolic episcopal lineage and revival of UAOC. = UAOC-Sobornopravna = In October 2002, in the USA was held the Council of the hierarchs of UAOC-Sobornopravna of North and South America ‚Äì the branch from Polish Orthodox Church that was headed by Metropolitan Hryhoriy (Ohiychuk) and after his death in 1985, by Metropolitan Andriy (Prazsky) (1985‚Äì90), then by Metropolitan Alexis (Nizza) (1990‚Äì99), then by Metropolitan Stephan (Babiy-Petrovich) (1999‚Äì2004). the Council of the hierarchs of UAOC-Sobornopravna, having considered the current situation of UAOC in Ukraine, decree: * return the ancient patriarchal model to the church system of UAOC-Sobornopravna; * resume the presence on the Ukrainian land by the establishment of Archdiocese of Kyiv and All Rus-Ukraine; * elevate Archimandrite Moses (Koulik) into the dignity of Bishop and assign in the rank of Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Rus-Ukraine to Ukraine for the establishment of Archdiocese of Kyiv and All Rus-Ukraine. On 10 October 2002, The consecration and elevation to the rank of Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Rus- Ukraine of Bishop Moses (Koulik) took place in the Boris and Gleb Cathedral of city Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Metropolitan Moses is assigned to Ukraine \\"for the re-establishment of Kyivan Metropolitanate and the revival of UAOC- Sobornopravna in Ukraine with the right to complete administrative management and spiritual care¬ª. On 1 November 2002, in a press-conference held, Metropolitan Stephan (Babiy-Petrovich), the Primate of UAOC-Sobornopravna of North and South America, dedicated to the historical Council of UAOC- Sobornopravna hierarchs and its decision as for return of Church from Diaspora to the territory of Ukraine. Starting in 2002 and till nowadays, Vladyka Moses fulfils the mission of revival of UAOC-Sobornoprana canonical lineage in Ukraine, charged to him by the decision of Diaspora hierarchs. In 2004-2005 UAOC-Sobornopravna in the USA saw events that changed cardinally the status of UAOC-Sobornopravna in Ukraine. UAOC-Sobornopravna of North and South America became UAOC of North and South America and Diaspora and, headed by metropolitan Mykhayil (Yavchak-Champion) joined with UAOC in Ukraine, declaring Metropolitan Mefodiy (Kudriakov) to be their Primate. Due to such union, instead of return of UAOC from Diaspora to Ukraine happened the development of UAOC from Ukraine to Diaspora, thereby one more canonical branch of Ukrainian Church was abolished. UAOC-Sobornopravna in Ukraine, headed by Metropolitan Moses, kept apart from this union and acquired the status of independent jurisdiction. Metropolitan Moses realized the active educational work, converting into Christianity a great number of atheists in the post-totalitarian Ukraine and called upon the unification of the scattered Ukrainians all over the world. = UAOC-Canonical = On 17‚Äì18 June 2005, on the Feast of the Holy Trinity, in Kyiv, the Hierarchs Council of UAOC-Sobornopravna under the omophorion of Moses, Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Rus-Ukraine took place, where the name of the Church was asserted as UAOC- Canonical by the decision of the Holy Synod and by the decision of the Ecumenical Hierarchs Council . UAOC-Canonical is the canonical successor of the Kyivan Rus Metropolitanate of the millenary Christening of Rus-Ukraine and has the very direct relation to the Tomos of autocephaly of 1924 granted by the Ecumenical Patriarch Gregorios VII on the canonical basis of the historical inhering to the Kyivan Rus Metropolitanate. The mission of the Thomas of 1924 action renewal for UAOC in Ukraine by the decision of the Holy Synod of UAOC in Diaspora is entrusted to the canonically-ordained Moses (Koulik), Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Rus-Ukraine. Patriarch On 17‚Äì18 June 2005, by the decision of the Holy Synod and by the decision of the Ecumenical Bishop's Council of UAOC-Canonical, under the action of the Holy Spirit, Metropolitan Moses was elected and enthroned into the dignity of Patriarch of Kyiv and All Rus-Ukraine. 12 Hierarchs, the clergy and the hundreds of the faithful from all over the world took part in the Holy Council. The enthronement took place on the Feast of the Holy Trinity in the orthodox sanctuary of the people of Ukraine, in the principal Temple of Ukraine - the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. Doctrine Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church-Canonical acknowledges the absolute faith in the teaching of Jesus Christ, the faith in the Holy Scripture and in the Apostolic Canons. The clergy have the canonical ordinations from Jesus Christ in the lineage of the Apostle Peter. This Church keeps seven Sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, Confession, Eucharist, Marriage, Ordination, Anointing. Church office UAOC-Canonical ministers the divine liturgies according to the tradition of the Eastern Byzantine Rite and keeps the old (Julian) calendar of religious holidays. UAOC-Canonical is a universal church, and the divine services are ministered in the language of the country, where they are held: modern Ukrainian in Ukraine, Spanish in Mexico, English in the US, Italian in Italy, etc..

Inaugural address  Buchanan/Breckinridge campaign poster In his lengthy inaugural address, President Buchanan referred to the \\"Territorial Question\\" of slavery spreading into the West, and made it clear that he was in favor of the previously passed Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 which allowed for popular sovereignty to decide on the issue. He did not however, speak on the rampant voter fraud that was occurring as both Northerners and Southerners flocked to Kansas in order to sway the vote in their favor, nor did he speak to the violence that was occurring in the streets as a result of the tense feelings between both regions of the country. Buchanan was criticized for not taking a strong stance on the decisive issue of slavery, and made it clear that he would \\"cheerfully accept\\" the opinion of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case. Additionally, Buchanan spoke at length regarding the country's economy and laid out plans for the nation's budget, including increasing the size of the Navy in order to protect the nation's interests in the East. Moreover, Buchanan discussed his strong feelings that a strict interpretation of the Constitution was the only safe manner in which to operate the Federal Government while simultaneously defending the appropriation of funds to a Trans-Atlantic road granted by Congress in order to protect California and other holdings on the Western Coast. In particular, Buchanan noted the difficulties that the Rocky Mountains would present in creating such a pathway, but defending it as a necessary work for the nation to undertake. Buchanan rounded out his inaugural address by touting the United States' history of taking possession of new lands, stating that territories and holdings were taken peacefully, and enjoyed increased economic trade and prosperity due to the paternal influence of America.Buchanan, James. \\"Miller Center.\\" Inaugural Address (March 4, 1857)-. N.p., n.d. Web. 11 Nov. 2016. Political controversy James Buchanan was seen to hold a whispered conversation with Roger Taney (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court) during the festivities. This ‚Äî combined with Buchanan's reference in his inaugural speech to a coming Supreme Court decision which would \\"speedily and finally\\" settle disputes over slavery in the U.S. territories, and the issuance of the Dred Scott v Sandford ruling (supporting Buchanan's views) two days after the speech ‚Äî gave rise to suspicions among many supporters of the Republican Party that Buchanan and Taney had conducted improper pre-decision consultations on the Dred Scott case at the inaugural, violating principles of executive-judicial separation.America in 1857: A Nation on the Brink by Kenneth M.

It is considered a forerunner of the French Vingt-et-un, a game very popular at the court of Louis XV,Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, p.218 - Oxford University Press and also a two-player simplification of the modern game of Blackjack.Scarne on Card Games, p. 196, John Scane, Dover Publications, NY 2004  The game  Quinze is generally admired for its simplicity and fairness, depending entirely upon chance, and not requiring the attention of most other games on the cards, and therefore calculated for those who love to sport upon an equal hazard.Hoyle, Edmund; and L. Dawson. Hoyle's Card Games, Routledge, 1979, p. 220 It is a card game of chance in which players compete with each other to acquire a hand of 15 points or as close to 15 as possible, hence the game is also known as Fifteen.Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, published 1913 by C. & G. Merriam Co. It is usually played by two persons only, with a full pack of 52 cards.  The play  The cards are shuffled by both players and when they have it cut for deal, which falls to the lot of that who cuts the lowest card, being Ace low and King high, the dealer is then free to shuffle them again. When this is done, the adversary cuts them, after which the dealer gives one card to his opponent and one to himself.The Modern Pocket Hoyle, p. 190, William Brisbane Dick - Dick & Fitzgerald, NY 1868 Should the dealer's adversary not approve of his card, he is entitled to have as many cards given to him, one after the other, as will make fifteen, or come nearest to that number, which are usually given from the top of the pack. That is, if the player is dealt a Two and then a Five, which amounts to seven, he must continue going on in expectation of coming nearer to fifteen. If he is dealt an Eight, which will make just fifteen, he, as having the best hand, is sure of winning the game. But if he is overdealt and makes more than fifteen, he loses, unless the dealer should do the same, in which case it is a drawn game, and the players double their stakes thus going on until one of them has won the game by being exactly fifteen or by standing as closest to this.The Dictionary of Gambling and Gaming, p. 171 - Thomas L. Clark - 1988 - 263 str. At the conclusion of each game, the cards are put up and shuffled and the players cut again for deal, and the elder then taken on the advantage of dealing the cards.

Construction and opening The Warrington and Altrincham Junction Railway (W&AJR;) built its railway line from Warrington Arpley via Latchford and Lymm to Skelton Junction near Altrincham during 1852/53 and passenger train services commenced on 1 November 1853. There were six intermediate stations provided along the line's length including that at Dunham Massey, in Cheshire, which was opened in June 1854. The station was located on the south side of Henshall Lane. Names used by the station The station was named Warburton from its opening until June 1856 when it became Warburton and Dunham. In October 1856 it was renamed Dunham, finally becoming Dunham Massey in April 1861, which name was retained until closure. Train services from the station The W&AJR; changed its name to the Warrington and Stockport Railway on 4 August 1853, before the line was completed and that company was absorbed into the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 15 July 1867. The main LNWR train service through Dunham Massey station was from Liverpool Lime Street via Warrington Arpley to Broadheath, where trains joined the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway and continued via Sale to Manchester London Road. In July 1922 the LNWR operated fifteen passenger trains in each direction on weekdays, eleven serving the full length of the line from Liverpool to Manchester and return. Amalgamation, nationalisation and closure The LNWR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMSR) on 1 January 1923. The LMSR continued to operate the passenger train service through Dunham Massey, but by July 1946 only eight trains per day in each direction stopped at the station. The LMSR was nationalised on 1 January 1948 and operations on the line were vested in British Railways London Midland Region (LMR). In January 1956 the service to Dunham Massey was eight trains in each direction, with the fare for the eleven miles single journey to Manchester being 1s 7d (8p). Passenger services along the line were withdrawn and the station was closed by British Railways on 10 September 1962. Freight trains continued to use the line until 7 July 1985, when the need for extensive repairs to the Latchford Viaduct caused the line to be closed. The station building survives in use as a domestic dwelling.

Following transfer of services to Maidstone Hospital, Oakwood closed in 1994 and was then developed as a residential estate known as St Andrew's Park.  History  =Construction and expansion= The Oakwood Hospital was founded as the \\"Kent County Lunatic Asylum\\" in 1833. It was designed as one building, commonly referred to as St Andrew's House, using an early corridor design by the surveyor to the County of Kent, John Whichcord Snr (who also designed Maidstone County Gaol). It was erected between 1829 and 1833 on a site in Barming Heath, just to the west of Maidstone. The asylum was intended to take in patients from across the entire county of Kent, which then stretched as far west as Greenwich. The first 168 patients were admitted in 1833. As the asylum expanded, additions and extensions were made to this building until it had reached maximum potential capacity. In 1850 an additional building, known as The Queen's House, was built on newly acquired land at the site. This building was also designed by the architect John Whichcord Snr. In the mid-nineteenth century, the superintendent of the asylum was Dr James Huxley (1821-1907), the elder brother of Thomas Henry Huxley, the evolutionary biologist and friend of Charles Darwin. Further expansion took place between 1867 and 1872 with the building of the third asylum block (also known as the Hermitage Block). On 29 November 1957, a fire broke out in the tailor's workshop on the first floor of one of the buildings. The fire brigade was called at 06:40 and arrived four minutes later. Six pumps attended and the 350 patients in that wing were evacuated. By 08:00 the fire was out, and the clearing-up process began. The block had been gutted but a tall ventilation tower seemed to have survived unscathed. At 10:00, the tower collapsed, killing three firemen, two nursing staff, the hospital printer and a patient and injuring a number of people. =Closure and redevelopment= Following the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s and also the transfer of some services to Maidstone Hospital, Oakwood Hospital then became known as the Maidstone Hospital (Psychiatric Wing). The hospital closed completely in 1994. St Andrew's House, the Queen's House, the Beeches (formerly the Superintendent's House), and the two lodges were all Grade II listed buildings and so were all subsequently converted for residential use.

He is considered one of the very few impressionist painters of Brazil. He is considered the initiator of the art nouveau in Brazil. Training In 1884 he entered the Liceu de Artes e Of√≠cios do Rio de Janeiro, where studied under Victor Meireles. Parallel to his studies in the Liceu, he entered the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes () studying under professors Henrique Bernardelli, Rodolfo Amoedo and Jose Maria de Medeiros. In 1888 he received a gold medal at the Academy. Like many of his contemporaries, including some of his teachers, he was involved in the effort to renew the Academy's teaching methods, deemed obsolete and was among the creators of the short-lived \\"Ateli√™ Livre\\", together with professors Jo√£o Zeferino of Costa, Rodolfo Amoedo, Henrique Bernardelli and Rodolpho Bernardelli.Grove Art Online Exhibitions Thanks to a prize received in 1892, Visconti travelled to Paris, where he attended the √âcole des Beaux Arts the following year. He also took classes at the Acad√©mie Julian(it)Treccani Encyclopedia, Irma Arestizabal, D'ANGELO, Eliseo and the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs, where he was a pupil of art nouveau master Eug√®ne Grasset. He was accepted at the Salon de la Nationale des Beaux Arts and at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© of des Artistes Fran√ßais. As one of the Brazilian representatives to the Exposition Universelle 1900 he exhibited the paintings Giovent√∫ and Or√©adas, for which he received a silver medal.Benezit Dictionary of Artists Back in Brazil, Visconti exhibited in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, and obtained the first place in a contest for the drawing of postal stamps for the Brazilian Casa da Moeda. He traveled again to Europe, where he exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1905 the portrait of the artist Nicolina Vaz de Assis now at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes. In this same year, he was invited to paint the stage curtain for the Teatro Municipal of Rio de Janeiro which he completed in his studio in Paris. Teaching activities In June 1906, he was selected to replace Henrique Bernardelli as a professor of painting at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes, the same Imperial Academia renamed after the proclamation of the republic. He accepted the position the following year after returning to Brazil, where he remained a teacher until 1913. Among his disciples were painters Marques Junior and Henrique Cavalleiro. Works Decorative schemes executed for the National Library or Biblioteca Nacional in (Rio de Janeiro) date from this period as does another gold medal he received at the International Exhibition of Saint-Louis (Louisiana Purchase Exposition), in 1904, for the painting Recompensa de S√£o Sebasti√£o (see external links). The museum of Santiago of the Chile acquired his Sonho M√≠stico (Mystical Dream) in 1912. In 1913, Visconti returned to Europe in order to paint large scale panels for the \\"foyer\\" of the Theatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro. His plans to return were interrupted by the First World War so he stayed in France until 1920. The resulting paintings for the \\"foyer\\" were sent to Brazil during the war, in 1915. In 1922 his triptych \\"Lar\\" gained him the Medal of Honor in a large exhibition created in Rio de Janeiro to commemorate the first centennial of Brazilian Independence, the Exposi√ß√£o do Centen√°rio.

The film centers on the story of Captain Tom Parker, who is forced to leave his family behind during a massive impact event.Apokalypse Eis - Der Tag, an dem die Welt erfriert Plot In 2010, during a party at the US embassy in Berlin, Germany, scientist Gregor Starndorf is told that the comet he discovered, designated Bay-Leder 7, is headed towards Earth. It is large enough to cause an extinction level event and is only days away. He develops a satellite weapon called SolStar-2, which is moderately successful against the comet: the microwave beam cut Bay-Leder 7 in two, but the smaller part impacts in western Russia. The head of US embassy security, Captain Tom Parker picks up his family so they can be evacuated. However, his superior, Colonel Waters, forces Parker to leave them behind, watching helplessly as the aircraft takes off. News reports depict the aftereffects of the impact. Three years later, the situation has not improved. Due to the debris thrown into the atmosphere, all of Europe's population was evacuated to Africa, where a new ruling body, the New United Northern States (NUNS), has been established. Oil prices also skyrocketed, enabling the Middle East to establish a firm grip on the world economy. A NUNS technician finds that SolStar-2 is still active. But the satellite can only be controlled from the command center below the Reichstag. The problem is, since the comet impact, Germany is covered in huge layers of ice. An aircraft, carrying personnel sent to investigate, explodes while flying over the area. Evidence points to SolStar-2 in the attack. NUNS President Miranda Harrison recruits Waters to lead an expedition‚Äîincluding ex- SAS Sarah Henley and Anna Starndorf, Gregor Starndorf's daughterto find out who controls the satellite and destroy it. Although Parker knows the mission is led by Colonel Waters, he asks to join, secretly hoping that his family is somehow alive. During their flight in, the SolStar-2 zeroes in on their position and destroys the aircraft. The team manages to parachute out with two armoured personnel carriers (APCs), though. During the trip, they must cross through Cologne and use the Cologne Cathedral as a guide there. However, they lose several men to marauders and one APC to an ice geyser. When they finally reach Berlin, they find that the city is buried in several meters of snow. Shortly afterwards, they come under attack from survivors. There are about 600 people hiding in the subway tunnels and supplied by the \\"Distributors\\". They find out a blind man called \\"the doctor\\" is hiding below the Reichstag and supplies the people with food. The doctor's quarters are actually a verdant greenhouse and he is Gregor Starndorf. He explains that he and his chief engineer Klaus Hintze were the designers of SolStar-2. It was originally meant to be a new power source to lessen the dependency on oil, but due to military funding, it became a weapon. He orders Hintze to reactivate the satellite to execute a program he has devised to extend its area of effect and stop the permanent winter. He is alarmed to hear that Hintze is using it as a weapon, but the Distributors suddenly return and during the battle a sniper kills him. Enraged, the four confront Hintze, who is powering up the satellite to destroy Tangier, the NUNS' headquarter city, as a revenge for having been left behind. Sarah shoots him and Col. Waters apologizes to Parker for his earlier actions and allows him to leave and find his family. While he is away, Sarah unexpectedly kills Waters and orders Anna to retarget SolStar-2 to destroy Mecca and possibly other targets in the Middle East, for which she says she will be paid $10 million by an unnamed group. Parker returns and, despite being wounded, attacks Sarah, nearly losing before Anna shoots her. Anna aims the satellite to Europe and executes her father's program to \\"kickstart the weather,\\" causing SolStar-2 to use up its last energy reserves to release a massive, wide-beamed microwave torrent which begins warming the atmosphere. Parker and Anna continue the search for his family and find his home. Inside he discovers his wife's final message to him beside their frozen bodies. Back outside, they watch the thick, permanent clouds over Germany dissipate, revealing the warming sun once again.

A prominent Baul (mystic minstrel), Dutta's body of work has led him to be considered \\"the father of dhamal songs\\"; his music is widely performed by modern Bengali musicians. Personal life and family In 640, the Raja of Tripura Dharma Fa planned a ceremony and invited five Brahmans from Etawah, Mithila and Kannauj. To compensate for their long journey, the Raja granted the Brahmans land in a place which came to be known as Panchakhanda (meaning five parts). One of the five Brahmans, Ananda Shastri of Mithila, was the ancestor of Nidhipati Shastri. In 1195, the King of Tripura granted Nidhipati some land in Ita. Ita was feudal to the Kingdom of Tripura and part of its Manukul Pradesh. Nidhipati became the founder of the Ita dynasty which would later gain a Raja status through his descendant, Bhanu Narayan. Bhanu Narayan's son, Ramchandra Brahma Narayan had a son called Prabhakar Dutta. In 1612, after Khwaja Usman's successful battle against the last Ita Raja, Subid Narayan, the royal family fled to nearby kingdoms in the Sylhet region. Prabhakar flees to Alisarkul (village in Srimangal) before seeking refuge in the Jagannathpur Kingdom. The King of Jagannathpur, Raja Vijay Singh allowed Prabhakar to live in the Keshabpur village. Later, Prabhakar's son, Sambhu Das Dutta, is made a minister under Vijay Singh. After the defeat of the Jagannathpur Kingdom by the Baniyachong Raja Habib Khan, the Dutta family decided to stay away from politics in order to protect themselves. Sambhu's son, Radha Madhab Dutta engaged himself in Sanskrit and Bengali literature. He translated Jayadeva's Gita Govinda into the Bengali language in addition to writing and composing famous songs and poems. Radharaman Dutta was born on May 25, 1833 in a Kayastha family in village of Keshabpur in Jagannathpur Upazila in Sunamganj District , Bangladesh. The youngest son of lyricist Radha Madhab Dutta, Dutta displayed a musical temperament from childhood. The early death of his father led Dutta to seek the approval of religious mentors throughout his life. Dutta's Vaishnavism (worship of Krishna) shaped his musical work and led him to a life of asceticism; he lived for some time in a house that amounted to little more than a seven-square-foot of mud-hut. Dutta was also heavily influenced by the Sufism that infuses Baul culture. Raman died in 1915. He was survived by his only son Bipin Bihari Dutta. Cultural influence Radharaman Datta wrote and composed over 3,000:bn:‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶Æ‡¶£ ‡¶¶‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§ songs in the Baul tradition and was known in particular for his \\"Geets\\" and \\"Dhamal\\" songs - compositions to traditional dance forms. He has been cited as the creator of the Dhamail art form. Dutta's compositions are performed today in weddings all over Bangladesh. Many popular Bengali songs of today were written originally by Radha Raman and his songs are sung by modern professional musicians in Bangladesh and in West Bengal, India. Dutta's most popular song, \\"Bhromor Koio Giya\\", was copied by Romanian singer Liviu Mititelu, for which it is called 'Vorbesc Cu tine Nu Ma Auzi'. This cover version was also a copy of the composition by Armeen Musa's first version of the original song. Tajik singer Noziya Karomatullo (–ù–æ–∑–∏—è–∏ –ö–∞—Ä–æ–º–∞—Ç—É–ª–ª–æ) has also covered it in Tajik. The title of her cover version is Kujo Kujo.

Giri. Habib, contesting as an independent candidate, received 28.55% of the votes. Early life and education Habib was a son of Mohammed Naseem, a barrister in Lucknow. His wife Sohaila Tyabji was the daughter of Abbas Tyabji, a noted disciple of Mahatma Gandhi.Obituary of Sohaila Habib in The Hindu, December 24, 2002 Their sons are Kamal Habib and Irfan Habib, who is a Professor Emeritus of history at Aligarh Muslim University.AMU confers emeritus status on Irfan Habib Habib studied at the M.A.O. School and College (now Aligarh Muslim University. He topped the B.A. examination of the Allahabad University in 1916. The Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College was then affiliated to Allahabad University. He then proceeded to New College, Oxford for higher studies. He became president of the Oxford Majlis for one term.\\"Mohammad Habib - Aligarh Movement\\" Retrieved 2015-03-09. It was in Oxford that he received his baptism in nationalism. The ideas of his liberal-minded tutor Ernest Barker, a meeting with Sarojini Naidu and the patronage of Maulana Mohammad Ali, who visited London during his stay in England, played a role in shaping his ideas. At the call of Mohammad Ali, he returned to India to teach at Jamia Millia Islamia but apparently never became a regular member of its staff. When the non-co-operation movement was called off in 1922, he accepted an appointment as a Reader, and almost immediately afterwards as Professor, at the newly chartered Aligarh Muslim University. Career In 1926, he won the election of the U.P. Legislative Council as a member of the (Swaraj Party). He admired Jawaharlal Nehru and donated a considerable part of his income to the Congress Party. At Aligarh, Habib made his mark in many ways. As an academician, his great emphasis was on writing history based on original sources, and he encouraged the study of aspects of history other than dynastic or political rule. He himself wrote on social and cultural history, and painstakingly unravelled the history of Muslim mystics for some of whom he came to cherish an almost personal affection. In the forties, his interest in Marxism heightened and in 1952 he presented, in a remarkable piece, his introduction to a reprint of volume II of Elliot and Dowson's The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians, which was an interpretation of early medieval India deeply influenced by Marxist ideas. He visited Paris to represent his country at the UN General Assembly, followed by a trip to Peking (now Beijing) in 1952 on the first goodwill mission from India to the People's Republic of China. Both the visits strengthened him in his belief in the need for India to help countries resisting imperialism. He kept nursing the sapling of liberalism in the portals of his university. Post-retirement He unsuccessfully contested for the office of the Vice-President of India in 1967 as a candidate of the combined opposition.Dr.zakir Hussain:quest for Truth, By Dr. Z. H.

He is currently a candidate for the Florida Senate in 2018. History Holder attended Middle Tennessee State University, where he received a degree in political science in 1990. While in college, he served as student body president and was the student ambassador for George H. W. Bush when he visited the campus. Holder moved to the state of Florida in 1997. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Nancy C. Detert was unable to seek re-election in 2006 due to term limits, Holder ran in the Republican primary to succeed her in the 70th District, which included most of western Sarasota County, stretching from Englewood to Siesta Key, and faced Rory Dubin, Jon Kleiber, and Elizabeth Cuevas-Neunder. He spent nearly $400,000 of his own money on advertising, \\"leading some people to accuse Holder...of trying to buy the office and of ignorance of local issues.\\" Holder emerged victorious in the Republican primary, winning 42% of the vote, and moved on to the general election, where he engaged in a contentious campaign with the Democratic nominee, attorney David Shapiro. Though Holder and Shapiro pledged to run positive campaigns, a group supporting Holder, People for a Better Florida Fund, which received a sizable donation from Holder's stepmother, attacked Shapiro for being a \\"millionaire trial lawyer\\" and for opposing tort reform. Holder narrowly won over Shapiro, winning 51% of the vote to Shapiro's 49%, a margin of just 756 votes. In 2008, retired dentist Sam Rosenfeld received the Democratic nomination to challenger Holder's bid for re-election, and though Democrats were hopeful that Rosenfeld could defeat Holder, given the closeness of his initial election, Holder easily dispatched his opponent, winning re-election with 61% of the vote. When Holder ran for re-election in 2010, his Democratic opponent, Nancy Feehan, attacked him over his vote \\"to allow the governor and cabinet to permit drilling from 3 to 10 miles from shore,\\" which had particular resonance given the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which caused Holder to change his mind on offshore oil drilling. However, despite this fact, Holder managed to repeat his 2008 victory, defeating Feehan with 61% of the vote. In 2012, when the legislative districts were reconfigured, Holder was moved to the 74th District, which included most of the territory that he previously represented in Sarasota County from the 70th District.

In August 2006, Ryan Foley listed the single as #8 in his Top 10 list of Scottish punk singles in Stylus Magazine. Foley declared that \\"‚ÄúPain‚Äù is thundering and thrashy, and heavily inspired by contemporary acts such as The Clash.

From early to almost-late 1976, the band was very popular in Britain, but the emergence of punk stopped all the prominence of the bands who established some time ago. The Slik album was unsuccessful, like the last singles, released until 1977.

The by-election was triggered by the elevation to the peerage of the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Viscount Ednam. The seat had been held by Labour since 1918, but had fallen to the Conservatives with a majority of over 4,000 as part of the 1931 election landslide less than a year earlier. The election was dominated by the continuing effects of the Great Depression. Labour, whose candidate was William Banfield, General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers and Confectioners, fought on the issue of the means test for unemployment benefit.

It is strategically located looking over a pass in the Sahyadri mountain range which was a major trade route from Bijapur in the interior of Maharashtra to the coastal areas. Due to its strategic location, it was the centre of several skirmishes in the Deccan involving the Marathas, the Mughals and the British East India Company, the most notable being the Battle of Pavan Khind. Here, the queen regent of Kolhapur, Tarabai, spent her formative years. Several parts of the fort and the structures within are still intact.It is also called as the 'Fort of Snakes' as it is zigzagged in shape800 years old Panhala fort called as Fort of Snakes:https://english.newstracklive.com/news/800-years-old-panhala-fort- called-the-home-of-serpents-sc108-nu910-ta272-1100816-1.html  History  Lotus motif on Panhala of Raja Bhoj, who built the fort Peacock motif on Panhala fort of the Adil Shah Sultanis Panahala fort was built between 1178 and 1209 CE, one of 15 forts (others including Bavda, Bhudargad, Satara, and Vishalgad) built by the Shilahara ruler Bhoja II. It is said that aphorism Kahaan Raja Bhoj, kahan Gangu Teli is associated with this fort. A copper plate found in Satara shows that Raja Bhoja held court at Panhala from 1191‚Äì1192 CE. About 1209‚Äì10, Bhoja Raja was defeated by Singhana (1209‚Äì1247), the most powerful of the Devgiri Yadavas, and the fort subsequently passed into the hands of the Yadavas. Apparently it was not well looked after and it passed through several local chiefs. In 1376 inscriptions record the settlement of Nabhapur to the south-east of the fort. It was an outpost of the Bahamanis of Bidar. Mahmud Gawan, an influential prime minister, encamped here during the rainy season of 1469. On the establishment of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur in 1489, Panhala came under Bijapur and was fortified extensively. They built the strong ramparts and gateways of the fort which, according to tradition, took a hundred years to build. Numerous inscriptions in the fort refer to the reign of Ibrahim Adil Shah, probably Ibrahim I (1534‚Äì1557). = Under Chhatrapati Shivaji = Statue of Baji Prabhu Deshpande at Panhala Statue of Shiva Kashid at Panhala fort In 1659, after the death of the Bijapur general Afzal Khan, in the ensuing confusion Shivaji took Panhala from Bijapur. In May 1660, to win back the fort from Shivaji, Adil Shah II (1656‚Äì1672) of Bijapur sent his army under the command of Siddi Johar to lay siege to Panhala. Shivaji fought back and they could not take the fort. The siege continued for 5 months, at the end of which all provisions in the fort were exhausted and Shivaji was on the verge of being captured. Under these circumstances, Shivaji decided that escape was the only option. He gathered a small number of soldiers along with his trusted commander Baji Prabhu Deshpande and, on 13 July 1660, they escaped in the dead of night to flee to Vishalgad. Baji Prabhu and a barber, Shiva Kashid, who looked like Shivaji, kept the enemy engaged, giving them an impression that Shiva Kashid was actually Shivaji. In the ensuing battle (see Battle of Pavan Khind), almost three quarters of the one thousand strong force died, including Baji Prabhu himself. The fort went to Adil Shah. It was not until 1673 that Shivaji could occupy it permanently. Sambhaji, Shivaji's son and successor to the throne. Shivaji met his brave son after he escaped from the Camp of Diler Khan after executing his father political agenda to bring Aurangzeb's successor over to the Maratha's. He escaped from here along with his wife on 13 December 1678 and attacked Bhupalgad. He returned to Panhala, however, on 4 December 1679 to reconcile with his father just before his father's death on 4 April 1680. At the height of Shivaji's power in 1678, Panhala housed 15,000 horses and 20,000 soldiers. also the main darwaza was chaar darwaza = Under the Kolhapur kings = Konkan Darwaja - Another entrance to the fort When Shivaji died, Sambhaji was able to convince the garrison at Panhala to join him in overthrowing his stepbrother Rajaram, thus becoming the Chhatrapati(king) of the Maratha Empire. In 1689, when Sambhaji was imprisoned by Aurangzeb's general Takrib Khan at Sangameshwar, the Mughals came to possess the fort. However, it was re-captured in 1692 by Kashi Ranganath Sarpotdar under the guidance of Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi a Maratha garrison commander of the fort of Vishalgad. In 1701 Panhala finally surrendered to Aurangzeb, who came for it in person. On 28 April 1692 the Mughal Emperor famously received the English ambassador Sir William Norris at Panhala fort. Norris spent \\"300 pounds in fruitless negotiation\\" with Aurangzeb but the details of what was being discussed was not disclosed. Within a few months the fort was retaken by the Maratha forces under Ramchandra Pant Amatya. In 1693, Aurangzeb attacked it again. This led to another long siege in which Rajaram escaped disguised as a beggar to Gingee Fort, leaving his 14-year-old wife Tarabai in Panhala. As Aurangzeb pursued Rajaram, Tarabai would stay at Panhala for almost five years before meeting her husband again. During this formative period of her life, Tarabai looked after the administration of the fort, resolved disputes and gained the respect of the people. The time she spent at Panhala provided her with experience in courtly matters and the support of her officers, which would influence later events. Rajaram did send reinforcements from Gingee, and Panhala came into Maratha hands in October 1693. In 1700, Rajaram, died leaving behind a 12-year-old son‚ÄîShivaji II‚Äîby his wife Tarabai. In 1705, Tarabai asserted her autonomy by founding an independent dynasty in the name of her son Shivaji II and ruling it as regent with Panhala as her headquarters. In Tarabai's war with Shahuji of Satara in 1708, Shahu took Panhala and Tarabai fled to Malvan in Ratnagiri. Shortly after, in 1709, Tarabai again took Panhala, established a separate state (Kolhapur Rajaram by his second wife Rajasbai succeeded to the throne. He died without issue in 1760. His widow Jijabai adopted the son of a Sahaji Bhonsle of Kanvat. Thus, Jijabai became the acting regent during the time that her adopted son was a minor. She came to believe that to prevent the fall of Panhala, the Mahakali shrine at the fort had to be ritually offered human blood for the appeasement of Goddess Kali. She would periodically send out her soldiers at night to scour the neighboring villages for victims. This practice would continue until her death in 1772. One of the towers near where these sacrifices occurred is still called the Kali tower. There were reports of Jijabai bestowing a plot of land to an oilman or Teli in return for the grant of his daughter-in-law to be buried alive under one of the Panhala towers. A shrine to the Teli's daughter- in-law (Gangubai) was subsequently erected and it is still a pilgrimage site for the people of the Teli community. In 1782, the seat of the Kolhapur government was moved from Panhala to Kolhapur. In 1827, under Shahaji I (1821‚Äì1837), Panhala and its neighboring fort Pavangad were given over to the British Raj. In 1844, during the minority of Shivaji IV (1837‚Äì1860), Panhala and Pavangad were taken by rebels who seized Colonel Ovans, the Resident of Satara, when he was on tour and imprisoned him in Panhala. A British force under General Delamotte was sent against the rebels and on 1 December 1844 breached the fort wall, took it by storm, and dismantled the fortifications. Thereafter, a British garrison was always left to guard the fort. The administration of the fort remained with Kolhapur until 1947.  Major features  Plan of the fort It is one of the largest forts in the Deccan, with a perimeter of and 110 lookout posts. It is above sea level. This fort is built on the Sahyadris, rising more than above its surrounding plain. Numerous tunnels stretch out from underneath the fort, one of which is almost 1 km long. Most of the architecture is of the Bijapuri style with the peacock motif of the Bahmani Sultanate prominently visible on several structures. Some of the older bastions also have the lotus motif of Bhoja II. There are several monuments at the fort which are considered notable by the Archaeological Survey of India. Andhar Bavai - the Hidden Well Panhala fortifications (tatabandi) = Fortifications and bastions = More than 7 km of fortifications (Tatabandi) define the approximately triangular zone of Panhala fort. The walls are protected for long sections by steep escarpments, reinforced by a parapet with slit holes. The remaining sections have high ramparts without a parapet, strengthened by round bastions the most notable of which is Rajdindi. (See later section) = Andhar Bavadi = Whenever an army besieged a fort, their first action was to poison the main water source of the fort. To counter this, Adil Shah commissioned the building of the Andhar Bavadi (Hidden Well). This is a three-storey structure with winding staircases that conceal the well which was the main water source for Panhala fort. There are recesses in the wall so that soldiers can be permanently stationed. Several hidden escape routes in the Andhar Bavai lead outside the fort. With its own water source, living quarters and its own exit routes, likely this structure was designed like a fort within a fort with the intention of making it an emergency shelter in case the main fort fell. = Kalavanticha Mahal = Kalvanticha Mahal (The courtesan's palace) The name of this building, which is also called Nayakini Sajja, literally means \\"Courtesans' Terrace room\\". It stands on the east side of the fort close to the rampart. By 1886, it had become a complete wreck with only traces of ornamental work on the ceiling. This was used during the occupation of the fort by the Bahmani Sultanate as a Rang Mahal(residences for the ladies of the court) Amberkhana(the granary) = Ambarkhana = The Amberkhana, situated in the center of the fort, were three granaries built in the Bijapuri style of architecture. They enabled Shivaji to withstand a 5-month siege by Siddhi Johar. It consists of three buildings called the Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati Kothis. The Ganga kothi, which was the largest, had a capacity of 25,000 khandis (with one khandi being 650 lbs). It covers an area of 950 sq m and is 10.5 m high. Rice, nachni and warai were the major provisions stored. Stairs on both sides lead the top of the buildings. It has sixteen bays each with its own flat vault with a hole on top through which grain used to be passed. The eastern entrance has a domed chamber with a balconey and plasterwork of the Bijapuri style. The plasterwork inside Sajja Kothi Wagh Darwaza, Panhala = Dharma Kothi = This was an additional granary next to the three granaries that constituted the Amberkhana. It was a stone building 55 feet by 48 feet by 35 feet high. This has an entrance and a staircase that leads to the terrace. Grain was distributed from here to the needy. = Sajja Kothi = Sajja Kothi is a one-storey structure built by Ibrahim Adil Shah in 1500 CE. It is also built in the Bijapuri style. Sajja Kothi was constructed as a viewing pavilion looking over the valley below. The domed upper chambers have faceted pendentives with the balconies hanging over the ramparts of the fort. This is where Shivaji imprisoned his son, Sambhaji, when he threatened to defect to Aurangzeb. Inner gate of Teen darwaza = Teen Darwaza = The Teen Darwaza was one of the three double gateways of the fort - the others being the Char Darwaja and Wagh Darwaja. The Char Darwaza was destroyed when during the British siege. The Teen Darwaja gate which is the main entrance to the fort is located north of the Andhar Bavai on the West side of the fort. It is a double gate with a court in between that has arcades. The outer gate has an ornate chamber on top with decorated eaves. The inner gate from the court is highly decorated with the lintel having finely carved motifs, including one of Ganesh. The latter has been placed by the Marathas during their occupation of the fort. There are three Persian inscriptions‚Äîone on top and one each on either side. All three declare that the gate \\"was built in the reign of Ibrahim Adil Shah I by Malik Daud Aki son of Minister Ahmed\\" in 954 AH (1534 CE). = Wagh Darwaza = This was another entrance to the fort. It was designed to elude invaders such that they would get trapped into a small courtyard and could then be easily neutralized. It has an elaborate Ganesh motif at the entrance. = Rajdindi bastion = The Rajdindi bastion was one of the hidden exits of the fort to be used in times of an emergency. It was used by Shivaji to escape to Vishalgad during the Battle of Pavan Khind. Rajdindi is still intact. = Temples and mausoleums = Sambhaji temple, Panhala fort There are temples devoted to Sambhaji II, Someshwar and Ambabai in addition to the Mahakali temple. The Ambabai temple is very old and it was here that Shivaji would make offerings before embarking on major expeditions. The mausoleum of Jijabai lies opposite to that of her husband, Sambhaji II. Ramchandra Pant Amatya (who wrote Adnyapatra, a treatise on Maratha policy) was the youngest minister in Shivaji's fort. He died at Panhala fort and a mausoleum was erected here for him and his wife. The mausoleums were covered with rubble till 1941 and till 1999 had not undergone any restoration work. Also a mausoleum to Moropant an 18th-century Marathi poet who wrote poetry in the adjacent Parashar caves can be seen. A shrine to a Muslim saint Sadhoba is also present.  Current use  Green Valley of Panhala, an view from Jotiba Ghat Road The palace of Tarabai, arguably the fort's most famous resident, is still intact. It is now used to house a school, several government offices and a boys' hostel. The rest of the fort is in ruins though the structures within the fort are frequented by tourists who visit Panhala town- a major hill station. It has been declared as a protected monument by the government. The Masai Pathar behind Panhala fort was chosen as an alternative location to shoot Padmaavat film.

For this inauguration, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies was chaired by Senator John Sparkman, and included Senators Carl Hayden and Styles Bridges, and Representatives Sam Rayburn, John W. McCormack, and Charles A. Halleck. Sinatra inaugural ball President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, wearing a gown designed by Ethel Franken of Bergdorf Goodman, arrive at Sinatra's inaugural ball on the evening of Inauguration Day. Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford organized and hosted a pre-inaugural ball at the D.C. Armory on the eve of Inauguration day, January 19, 1961, considered as one of the biggest parties ever held in Washington, D.C. Sinatra recruited many Hollywood stars who performed and attended, and went as far as convincing Broadway theatres to suspend their shows for the night to accommodate some of their actors attending the gala. With tickets ranging from $100 per person to $10,000 per group, Sinatra hoped to raise $1.7 million ($ in today's dollars) for the Democratic Party to eliminate its debt brought on by a hard-fought campaign. Many Hollywood stars gave brief speeches or performed acts, rehearsed by Kay Thompson and directed by Roger Edens, and stayed at the Statler-Hilton Hotel where preparations and rehearsals were photographed by Phil Stern. Performances and speeches included Fredric March, Sidney Poitier, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Gene Kelly, Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, Bill Dana, Milton Berle, Jimmy Durante, Harry Belafonte, and Sinatra himself. Sammy Davis, Jr., a long-time friend of Sinatra, supporter of the Democratic Party, and member of the Rat Pack, was asked by John F. Kennedy not to attend the gala at the behest of his father Joseph, fearing that his interracial marriage to Swedish actress May Britt was too controversial for the time and occasion, much to Sammy's and Sinatra's dismay. Davis had already postponed his wedding to Britt until after the election, also at the request of the Kennedy campaign via Sinatra. Davis eventually switched his support to the Republican Party and Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. Harry Belafonte expressed sadness at the controversy, stating \\"It was the ambassador, [but] we didn't know that until after. Sammy not being there was a loss.\\" At the end of the ball, Kennedy spoke to thank Sinatra on the festivities and his support of the Democratic Party throughout his life and the 1960 campaign, adding \\"The happy relationship between the arts and politics which has characterized our long history I think reached culmination tonight.\\" Jacqueline retired to the White House before the ball ended at 1:30am (ET), and John went to a second pre- inaugural ball hosted by his father Joseph Kennedy, and would finally return to the White House at around 3:30am. The inaugural nor'easter A strong nor'easter fell the day before the inauguration, with temperatures at and snowfall at per hour and a total of during the night, causing transportation and logistical problems in Washington and serious concern for the inauguration. On inauguration day, January 20, 1961, the skies began to clear but the snow created chaos in Washington, almost canceling the inaugural parade. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was put in charge of clearing the streets during the evening and morning before the inauguration, and were assisted by more than 1,000 District of Columbia employees and 1,700 Boy Scouts. This task force employed hundreds of dump trucks, front-end loaders, sanders, plows, rotaries, and flamethrowers to clear the route. Over 1,400 cars which had been stranded due to the conditions and lack of fuel had to be removed from the parade route along Pennsylvania Avenue. The snowstorm dropped visibility at Washington National Airport to less than half a mile, preventing former President Herbert Hoover from flying into Washington and attending the inauguration. Inauguration proceedings View of the extended East Front of the Capitol where the inauguration was held. President Kennedy is in the center delivering his inaugural address, with Vice-President Johnson and official and invited guests sitting behind him. Before the proceeding to the Capitol in company with outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Kennedy went to a morning Mass at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown. Cardinal Richard Cushing gave the invocation at the inaugural which lasted for 12 minutes, with additional prayers recited by Archbishop Iakovos of the Greek Orthodox Church and Reverend Dr. John Barclay of the Central Christian Church of Austin, Texas, and a blessing offered by Rabbi Nelson Glueck. The invocation and prayers lasted a total of 28 minutes. Marian Anderson sang \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", and a composition by musical Leonard Bernstein titled \\"Fanfare for the Inauguration of John F. Kennedy\\" was played. The oath of office for Vice President was administered by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Sam Rayburn to Lyndon Johnson. This marked the first time a Speaker administered the oath, which had been given in previous inaugurations by either the President pro tempore of the Senate, the outgoing Vice President, or a United States Senator. Robert Frost, then 86 years old, recited his poem \\"The Gift Outright\\".Tuten, Nancy Lewis; Zubizarreta, John (2001). The Robert Frost Encyclopedia. Greenwood Publishing Group, Kennedy requested Frost to read a poem at the inauguration, suggesting \\"The Gift Outright\\", considered an act of gratitude towards Frost for his help during the campaign. Kennedy would later state that he admired the \\"courage, the towering skill and daring\\" of Frost, and adding that \\"I've never taken the view the world of politics and the world of poetry are so far apart. I think politicians and poets share at least one thing, and that is their greatness depends upon the courage with which they face the challenges of life.\\" American poet William Meredith would say that the request \\"focused attention on Kennedy as a man of culture, as a man interested in culture.\\" Frost composed a new poem titled Dedication specifically for the ceremony as a preface to the poem Kennedy suggested, to the surprise of Kennedy's friends. On the morning of the inauguration, Frost asked Stewart Udall, Kennedy's future Secretary of the Interior, to have his handwritten draft type scripted for easier reading, to which Udall obliged. Once at the presidential podium, however, the glare of the sun and snow prevented him from reading his papers. When Frost started reading, he stumbled on the first three lines, squinting at his papers in view of the crowd and cameras. Vice-President Johnson tried to assist by using his top hat as a shade, however Frost waved the offer aside, took the hat and jokingly said \\"I'll help you with that\\", sparking laughter and applause from the crowd and President Kennedy. Understanding the immediacy of the situation, Frost stated to the microphones that \\"this [the poem] was to have been a preface to a poem which I do not have to read\\", and began to recite \\"The Gift Outright\\" from memory. This marks the first time a poem was read at a Presidential inauguration, a feature repeated by future Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at their respective ceremonies. Frost gave the type scripted version of the undelivered \\"Dedication\\" poem to Udall after the ceremony, who eventually donated the document to the Library of Congress where it is stored today. The original manuscript version, personally dedicated by Frost, was provided to the President and currently held by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Kennedy's wife Jacqueline framed this manuscript version, writing on the back of the frame: For Jack. First thing I had framed to be put in your office. First thing to be hung there. Frost officially presented the poem, retitled to For John F. Kennedy His Inauguration and expanded from 42 to 77 lines, to Kennedy in March 1962. The unread poem (published in 1962 as part of Frost's In the Clearing poetry collection) was finally recited at the U.S. Capitol by Chaplain Daniel P. Coughlin during the 50th anniversary celebrations of Kennedy's inauguration. =Oath of office= The oath of office for the President was administered by Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren to Kennedy using a closed family Bible at 12:51 (EST) although he officially became president at the stroke of noon.New York Times, January 21, 1961, p. 8, col. 1. Kennedy did not wear an overcoat when taking the oath of office and delivering the inaugural address, despite the cold conditions of with windchill at at noon. The inaugural address thirty-fifth President of the United States, and delivering his inaugural address. Immediately after reciting the oath of office, President Kennedy turned to address the crowd gathered at the Capitol. His 1366-word inaugural address, the first delivered to a televised audience in color, is considered among the best presidential inaugural speeches in American history. =Drafting= Kennedy's gravesite in Arlington National Cemetery, with the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument in the background. The speech was crafted by Kennedy and his speech writer Ted Sorensen. Kennedy had Sorensen study President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address as well as other inaugural speeches. Kennedy began collecting thoughts and ideas for his inauguration speech in late November 1960. He took suggestions from various friends, aides and counselors, including suggestions from clergymen for biblical quotations. Kennedy then made several drafts using his own thoughts and some of those suggestions. Kennedy included in his speech several suggestions made by Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith and by the former Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson II. Kennedy's line \\"Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\\" is nearly identical to Galbraith's suggestion \\"We shall never negotiate out of fear. But we shall never fear to negotiate.\\" Stevenson's suggestion \\"if the free way of life doesn't help the many poor of this world it will never save the few rich.\\" was the basis for Kennedy's line \\"If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\\" =Main ideas of the speech= As a president coming into power at the height of the Cold War, President Kennedy's duty of maintaining peaceful international relations with representing the United States as a force to be reckoned was daunting, at the very least. It is this overarching goal of his presidential term that dominates his inaugural address. Kennedy highlights the newly discovered dangers of nuclear power coupled with the accelerating arms race, and essentially makes the main point that this focus on pure firepower should be replaced with a focus on maintenance of international relations and helping the impoverished in the world.\\"John F. Kennedy Inaugural Address\\". Bartleby. Retrieved October 4, 2013. =Rhetorical elements= The main focus of the speech can crudely be boiled down to one theme ‚Äì the relationship between duty and power.\\"The Timeless Speech: A Close Textual Analysis of John F. Kennedy's Inaugural\\". Biane. Retrieved October 5, 2013. This is emphasized by Kennedy's strong use of juxtaposition in the first part of the speech. For example, he states in the second passage, \\"... Man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life,\\" a clear calling-out of not only America, but also other nations of power for skewed Cold War priorities. He again employs the strategy in the fifth passage when he says, \\"United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided there is little we can do,\\" again appealing to the idea of refocusing of international values.\\"Text Analysis, John F. Kennedy, 1961.\\" Cruz. Retrieved October 5, 2013 Again, after exhorting \\"both sides\\" to action, he calls on all of \\"us\\" \\"to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle ... against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself,\\" though the phrase \\"long twilight struggle\\" came to be associated with the cold war struggle against communism. One of the main components of classical rhetoric; kairos - which means to say or do whatever is fitting in a given situation, and is the style with which the orator clothes the proof, as well as to prepon (the appropriate) - which means what is said must conform to both audience and occasion, are also extremely prevalent in this address.\\"Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric.\\" Poulakos. Philosophy and Rhetoric 16(1983):35‚Äì48. Recognizing the fear and anxiety prevalent in the American people since the start of the Cold War, Kennedy geared his speech to have an optimistic and even idealistic tone as a means of providing comfort. He does this by quickly moving the time of the speech into the future, and invokes repetition of the phrase \\"Let both sides ...\\" to allude to how he plans to deal with strained relations while also appealing to the end goal of international unity. He also phrases negative ideas in a manner so as to present them as opportunities ‚Äì a challenge, appealing to innately American ideals. A great line to emphasize this is in the fourth from last passage, where he states, \\"In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger,\\" a simple twist of words that challenges the American public rather than frightening them. It was also in his inaugural address that John F. Kennedy spoke his famous words, \\"ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\\" This use of chiasmus can be seen even as a thesis statement of his speech ‚Äì a call to action for the public to do what is right for the greater good. (This appears to be an elegant rephrasing of Franklin D. Roosevelt's acceptance speech at the 1936 Democratic National Convention: \\"To some generations much is given. Of other generations much is expected. This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.\\") Invited guests Along with official presidential guests and honorees, including former presidents, vice-presidents, cabinet members, and other Washington officials, the Kennedys invited famous men and women of the arts, including Carl Sandburg, John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, Brendan Behan, Mark Rothko, and fashion icon and future Vogue editor Diana Vreeland. Congressman Tip O'Neill sat next to wealthy Boston businessman George Kara: =Presidents and First ladies= Five first Ladies, Edith Wilson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Truman, Mamie Eisenhower and Jackie Kennedy attended the event, as did future First Ladies Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon, and Betty Ford. Former President Harry S Truman joined Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy on the platform, as did future Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald Ford, making this, retroactively, the largest conclave of the \\"presidential fraternity\\" prior to the opening of the Reagan Library in the 1990s. Parade to the White House A vast parade along Pennsylvania Avenue followed the inauguration ceremony, bearing the new President from Capitol Plaza to the White House. Upon his arrival, Kennedy mounted a reviewing stand shared with honored guests such as former President Harry Truman and former First Ladies Edith Wilson and Eleanor Roosevelt. Throngs of onlookers and millions of television viewers also watched the procession; it took three hours to pass by. Sixteen thousand members of the US armed forces marched with displays of modern weaponry like the Minuteman missile and the supersonic B-70 bomber. A further sixteen thousand marchers were civilians ranging from federal and state officials to high school bands and Boy Scouts, accompanied by forty floats. Impact Kennedy's inauguration marked many firsts for the United States. Kennedy was the first, and to this date, the only Catholic inaugurated as commander-in-chief. At the inauguration, Kennedy, then 43, was the youngest elected president and was replacing the oldest president in American history at that time, Eisenhower. The age difference and visual impact of the turnover from Eisenhower's presence to Kennedy's was noticeable at the inauguration. In addition, Kennedy was the first person born in the 20th century to have been inaugurated as President. The claim that Kennedy did not wear a hat to his inauguration, and so single-handedly killed the men's hat industry, is false. Kennedy wore a top hat to the inauguration and to the balls in the evening, removing it only to be sworn in and give his address. He in fact restored the tradition, after Eisenhower broke with it by wearing a homburg instead of a top hat to both of his inaugurations. Johnson, at his inauguration in 1965, was the first President to go completely hatless.

Kessler is cited as being the first \\"forensic auditor\\", a term originally coined by him, and now widely used within the industry. Forensic accounting is one of the fastest growing professions in the nation. Kessler's credentials include Cr.FA (Certified Forensic Accountant), CFE (Certified Fraud Examiner), CICA (Certified Internal Controls Auditor), DABFA (Diplomate with the American Board of Forensic Accountants), and FABFE (Fellow status with the American Board of Forensic Examiners).About Michael Kessler In January 2006 Kessler was elected chairman of the American Board of Forensic Accounting, an advisory board of the American College of Forensic Examiners.  Notable investigations  In early 2008, Kessler began investigating fraudulent loan operations. Kessler investigated an alleged Long Island-based Ponzi scheme masquerading as a legitimate bridge loan company, called Agape World. Further investigation revealed numerous red flags, leading Kessler to believe that Agape World was in fact a Ponzi scheme, and he alerted the FBI and other law enforcement agencies as to his findings. Shortly thereafter, the FBI and the USPIS launched their own investigation. Agape World continued to operate, but after the collapse of the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme, Agape World came under increased scrutiny and suspicion by investors, as can be seen on the forums FatWallet and ScamVictimsUnited.com, websites in which alleged scams are discussed and scam victims can tell their stories or seek advice. In December 2008 and January 2009, Kessler received numerous reports from investors in Agape World that the payout dates for various bridge loans were being extended or not paid at all, signs that are usually indicative of a collapsing Ponzi scheme. In January 2009, Nicholas Cosmo, founder of Agape World, was arrested by authorities and is alleged to have defrauded investors of an approximate total of $370 million. In January 2010, Kessler was hired by the city of Fort Pierce, Florida, to audit the city's Community Services Department. As a result of their work, Kessler recommended the city turn over its findings to the U.S. Attorney's Office to determine whether criminal charges should be filed.

During the Wars, a central part of British strategy was to isolate French ports from international trade in an attempt to both restrict French imports of food and military supplies and simultaneously to damage the French economy. To achieve this, British warships maintained a constant vigil off the French coastline, attacking ships that attempted to enter or leave French ports. Despite the threat that their ships faced, communication and the transfer of supplies between France and her colonies was vital to the French war effort, and the French Navy made constant attempts to evade the patrolling British squadrons. In late 1808, a significant French squadron was deployed to Isle de France (now Mauritius) to disrupt British trade in the Indian Ocean. This force required reinforcement and supply from France, and periodic attempts were made to reach the isolated convoy with new frigates, the first of which was Ni√©men. Ni√©men was a new and fast ship, carrying 40 guns and a large quantity of much needed naval supplies. However, in order to leave her home port of Brest, it was necessary to avoid contact with the British frigates that constantly watched the entrance to the harbour in search of enemy movement. In April 1809, these ships were HMS Amethyst and , loosely supported by other patrolling ships and tasked specifically with the capture of Ni√©men, acting on intelligence passed on by the Admiralty. When Ni√©men emerged on 5 April, she was immediately spotted and chased. Amethyst retained contact throughout the night and brought the French ship to action on the morning of 6 April. The ensuing battle was fiercely contested and both ships suffered severe damage and heavy casualties. While the outcome of the battle was still undecided, a second British frigate‚Äî‚Äîarrived. Outnumbered, the French captain saw no alternative and surrendered his ship. The late arrival of Arethusa‚Äîunder Captain Robert Mends, who claimed the victory for himself‚Äîsparked a furious argument that developed into a lasting animosity between Mends and Captain Michael Seymour of Amethyst. The failure of Ni√©men to reach Isle de France also had serious repercussions for the French squadron there. With naval supplies severely limited, their ability to operate at sea for long periods of time was hampered and by late 1810 few of their vessels were still seaworthy. Background During the Napoleonic Wars, as with the French Revolutionary Wars that preceded them, the British Royal Navy enjoyed almost complete dominance at sea. By 1809, their superiority was so entrenched that few French ships even left port, because to do so meant breaking through a system of blockading warships off every major French harbour.Gardiner, p. 17 The biggest port in France at the time was Brest in Brittany, and thus it was there that the greatest concentration of British warships off the French coast was concentrated. The main squadron was formed from large ships of the line, often dubbed the \\"Offshore Squadron\\" due to their position up to a hundred miles from the coast, to avoid the risks posed by the rocky Biscay shore. This was complemented by the \\"Inshore Squadron\\", formed primarily from frigates and brigs, which was tasked with watching the myriad entry points to Brest and other Biscay ports. These frigates often sailed independently or in small squadrons, maintaining contact with each other and with the Offshore Squadron via signals and despatch boats.Gardiner, p. 34 Despite their inferiority at sea, both in numbers and experience, frigates of the French Navy were still required to leave port regularly on raiding missions against British commerce and to convoy supplies and reinforcements to overseas regions of the French Empire. These colonies formed bases for French commerce raiders, and in 1808 a determined effort was made to develop a raiding squadron on the French Indian Ocean territories of Isle de France and √éle Bonaparte. These ships‚Äîled by Commodore Jacques Hamelin‚Äîrequired regular resupply from France as they were unable to repair damage and replenish ammunition and food from the reserves on the Indian Ocean islands alone. In early 1809, therefore, it was decided to reinforce and resupply the squadron by despatching the newly built frigate from Brest under Captain Jean Dupotet.Woodman, p. 282 In January 1809, John Tremayne Rodd‚Äîcaptain of the frigate , then part of the Inshore Squadron‚Äîobtained information that Ni√©men was preparing to sail from Brest. Rodd passed this information to the Admiralty, who took immediate steps to intercept the French ship.Wareham, p. 186 For this purpose, they selected Captains Michael Seymour of and Frederick Lewis Maitland of HMS Emerald. These captains had extensive experience serving with the Inshore Squadron off Brest and Seymour, who had lost an arm at the Glorious First of June, was much in favour for his recent capture of the French frigate at the Action of 10 November 1808.Seymour, Sir Michael, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 24 January 2009 Seymour and Maitland‚Äîduring their patrols in 1808 that led to the capture of Th√©tis‚Äîhad entered into a verbal agreement that any prize money they earned would be shared equally over both crews. This agreement continued on their new commission, which was jealously guarded from other captains: when Seymour discovered hunting in the same area in March, he was furious and ordered her away.Wareham, p. 187 Battle On 3 April 1809, Ni√©men‚Äîladen with provisions and naval stores for Isle de France‚Äîsailed from Brest, passing through the rocky passages that sheltered the port during the night and thus avoiding discovery by the regular Inshore Squadron. Steering westwards, Dupotet made good time, travelling nearly over the next two days with the intention of escaping the British patrols in the Bay of Biscay and reaching the open Atlantic. At 11:00 on 5 April, however, Dupotet spotted two sails to the northwest. Assuming them to be British, Dupotet turned southwards in the hope of outrunning them. The sails‚Äîwhich belonged to Amethyst and Emerald‚Äîimmediately gave chase. Throughout the day, the three ships sailed southward, Amethyst slightly gaining on Ni√©men but leaving Emerald far behind, Maitland's ship disappearing from view at 19:20 as darkness fell.James, p. 157 Dupotet attempted to throw off Amethysts pursuit during the night by turning westwards once more, but Seymour anticipated this manoeuvre and turned his ship westwards as well, discovering Ni√©men only a few miles ahead at 21:40.Clowes, p. 433 Rapidly gaining on the French ship, Seymour began firing his bow-chasers, small guns situated in the bows of the frigate, in an attempt to damage her rigging so that he could bring his broadsides to bear. Dupotet responded with his stern-chasers, but by 01:00 on 6 April it was clear that Amethyst was going to catch the French frigate. The pursuit had been exhausting: since first sighting the British ships, Ni√©men had travelled over and was just from the Spanish coast when she was caught. At 01:15, Amethyst opened fire, Ni√©men immediately responding and turning to the northeast in an attempt to shake off the British ship. Seymour followed his opponent and at 01:45 was again close enough to engage, the frigates firing upon one another from close range for over an hour.James, p. 158 At 02:45, Amethyst was able to pull across the bows of Ni√©men, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Ni√©men surged forward into Amethyst, but the collision caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east.Clowes, p. 434 The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Ni√©mens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Ni√©mens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire broke out in the main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Ni√©mens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control. Although Ni√©men was very badly damaged, Amethyst was almost uncontrollable and despite Seymour's best efforts, he was unable to close with Ni√©men to ensure her surrender. Dupotet meanwhile was overseeing hasty repairs in the hope of getting away before Amethyst could recover. At 03:45, however, a new ship emerged from the darkness, soon revealed to be the British frigate HMS Arethusa.Clowes, p. 435 Arethusa was deployed as part of the force blockading the ports of Northern Spain and her commander, Captain Robert Mends, was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding the French-held port of Lekeitio.James, p. 156 Mends immediately pulled alongside Ni√©men and Dupotet fired a single shot each at Amethyst and Arethusa. The shot at Amethyst missed its target, but the one at Arethusa struck the ship and threw up splinters. Mends was struck on the forehead and badly wounded, the only man to be hit. Both Amethyst and Arethusa then opened fire, Ni√©men surrendering immediately.Mends, Sir Robert, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 24 January 2009 Aftermath Aside from Captain Mends on Arethusa, casualties were severe on both sides. Amethyst had eight killed and 37 wounded from a crew of 222, while the French ship lost 47 killed and 73 wounded from a crew of 339. Recriminations among the British officers began within minutes of the French surrender: Mends took possession of Ni√©men and sent a note to Seymour informing him that he had seized the valuable French nautical charts and the French captain's personal stores. The note also requested that Seymour send back Arethusa's surgeon, who had gone aboard Amethyst to assist with the wounded, so that Mends could be ready to leave without notice.Wareham, p. 186 Seymour, who was still effecting hasty repairs and dealing with his casualties, responded angrily, forcing Mends to back down and return the stores. Seymour was also annoyed by Mends' late arrival, which meant that Arethusa was entitled to half the prize money from the captured frigate without having done any of the fighting. Repairs were completed on 7 April, and Amethyst and Ni√©men limped back to Plymouth, arriving on 13 April.Wareham, p. 191 On arrival in Britain, Seymour was celebrated and rewarded with a baronetcy for his second victory in less than six months while all of his officers were promoted. Ni√©men was purchased into the Navy for the sum of ¬£29,979-2-10d, which was split between the government, the crew and a number of other parties. The share that went to the captors came under dispute: Mends had no intention of abiding by Seymour's agreement with Maitland and refused to allow Emerald to share in the prize money.Wareham, p. 188 Seymour and Maitland took Mends to court and the ensuing legal battle lasted years, Mends deliberately exaggerating his role in the capture of Ni√©men in public (although privately admitting that the victory was entirely Seymour's). Seymour and Mends became bitter enemies and their animosity continued throughout their lives, although both remained in the Navy and had successful careers. Forty years later, the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. In France, the action was infamous for a despatch supposedly sent by Dupotet and subsequently printed in edited form in the newspaper Le Moniteur Universel. The report, which was later used by Mends in his dispute with Seymour, claimed that Ni√©men had not only been largely undamaged before Arethusa's arrival, but that Seymour had actually surrendered to the French captain before Mends arrived. This story, almost totally invented, was widely believed in France at the time. The effect on the Mauritius campaign of the defeat of Ni√©men was not immediately apparent, Hamelin's squadron remaining a menace to British shipping well into 1810. However, in the aftermath of the destructive Battle of Grand Port, the French, although the victors, were unable to repair their ships due to lack of naval stores and their effectiveness declined until they were unable to resist the Invasion of Isle de France in November 1810.Woodman, p. 291 This inability was directly related to the failure of all but one of the French frigates sent to reinforce and resupply the island to reach it, the others either captured or driven back en route.Gardiner, p. 37 Notes References   * Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars Conflicts in 1809 Naval battles involving France Naval battles involving the United Kingdom April 1809 events ","title":"Action of 6 April 1809"},{"id":"21213091","text":"Old Trinity Church, also known as Trinity Church, Oxford, is a historic Episcopal church founded in 1698 in Oxford Township, Pennsylvania, which is now part of Philadelphia. Building history HABS architectural drawing A marble stone in the wall of the church bears an inscription that Church of England services were first held on the site in 1698 in a Quaker meeting house of log construction. The present building was erected in 1711 of red and black brick believed to have been brought from England. In 1759, the pews were installed.Rev. Edward Young Buchanan, Historical Sketch of the Parish of Trinity Church, Oxford, Philadelphia: Read in the Church on Sunday, Aug. 2d, 1857, (Philadelphia: Lindsay & Blakiston, 1857). In 1807, the flooring was completed, and the entrance was moved from the north side to the west end. In 1833, the transepts were added, and in 1839, a tower was built at the west entrance. The present corner tower and belfry were added in 1875, designed by the architectural firm of Furness & Hewitt. Interior alterations were made at the same time.George E. Thomas, et al., Frank Furness: The Complete Works, (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, revised 1996), pp. 192-93, cat. 64. Minor additions were made in 1932. Congregation and pastors A log meetinghouse was build by teenagers John and Rees Price, who along with their step-mother resettled their from the Welsh Merion Meeting. They are buried in the churchyard, considered a Sabbathist Landmark. The family sailed from England in the Lyon, part of William Penn's Fleet for religious freedom. Oxford Meeting records are on file in Quaker records. They abruptly end in 1696 when almost the entire congregation converted to Anglican. Quaker history notes it is the only known instance of this happening. The cause of this is attributed to Radical Quaker George Keith who later was ordained Church of England. Keith returned to preach at Trinity two more times. Thomas Clayton is considered the first minister of Trinity. He died in 1698 and baptized over 500 persons in the area. Andreas (Andrew) Rudman was also an early preacher, formerly of Old Swedes Church in Philadelphia.Trinity Oxford is in possession of a prayer book send over from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Lands, dated 1705. This possibly was brought over by George Keith who was involved in the establishment of the Society. The Rev. John Clubb, who served in 1705, and later the Rev. Robert Weyman, who served during the 1720s, were paid a stipend to preach in the Welsh Language at Radnor, about 20 miles to the west. This was very arduous especially in the Winter. The Rev. John Clubb only lasted a year and died doing so. The ministers were always paid and provided for by the congregation. The Church of England would not provide a Bishop to the Colony. This prevented ordinations and proper blessing of the new church building. In 1713, Queen Anne presented a silver communion set to the congregation inscribed \\"Annae Reginae\\" is still used on special occasions. Among the church's rectors were Rev. Aeneas Ross, 1742‚Äì1758, brother of George Ross, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and father-in-law of Betsy Ross; the Rev. Dr. William Smith, 1766‚Äì1779 and 1791‚Äì1798, who founded, and served as the first Provost of, the College of Philadelphia (afterward the University of Pennsylvania); the Rev. John Henry Hobart, 1798‚Äì1801, who became Bishop of New York and founded Hobart College; and Edward Young Buchanan, 1854‚Äì1882, brother of President James Buchanan. The church was admitted to the Convention of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania in 1786 following the American Revolutionary War.

At the administrative reorganization of Lisbon on 8 December 2012 it became part of the parish Miseric√≥rdia.Lei n.¬∫ 56/2012 (Reorganiza√ß√£o administrativa de Lisboa). Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, 1.¬™ S√©rie, n.¬∫ 216. Accessed 25/11/2012. Its area is 0.21 km2, and its population exceeds 4081 inhabitants (density 19433 inhabitants/km2). History Church of Saint Catherine of Alexandria peeking from between the 18th Century buildings of the Santa Catarina quarter of Lisbon The civil parish was instituted in on October 9, 1559, when it was de-annexed from the neighbouring parishes of Loreto (which later became Encarna√ß√£o and M√°rtires, and included a stretch of land descending from Principe Real to Boavista. Its territory was one of the more extensive urban areas and, until the end of the 20th Century, one of the most populous. Its history was linked to Portuguese discoveries in the 14th and 15th Century, and is characterized by a diverse historical, sociological and cultural influence that mingled the aristocratic and popular. The administrative limits have suffered successive alterations, the last of which (1959) caused controversy by removing many of the emblematic infrastructures of the parish. This included, specifically, the de-annexation of the area around the Miradouro do Alto de Santa Catarina, an area considered a historical link to the areas past, and which provided in the 16th-17th Centuries assisted the patrol of the Tejo River. Many figures linked to the cultural or political life of the city (and the country) lived for a time in the parish, including Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage, Almeida Garrett, Alexandre Herculano and Camilo Castelo Branco. Also, in 1847 (on Rua de S√£o Boaventura) Maria Am√°lia Vaz de Carvalho was born (and also lived and died), a champion of women's rights, who affirmed, :\\"The women have power. It is necessary to take advantage of them in the works of our common civilization. It is necessary, before everything transforms the education of the woman. The first thing that a woman did not learn is that she should learn and think. Dominate her destiny, modify it when it is convenient, because a faculty can just have those whom rationalize and those who know.\\" Geography The parish is part of a mountainous area, part of the Bairro Alto, that descends south toward the Tejo, and west to toward the parish of S√£o Bento, cutting the Cal√ßada do Combro, supposedly the principal roadway in the formation of Lisbon, and where today is concentrated the largest group of architecturally significant buildings in the region. In the northern part of the parish is a scattering of small shops, artesian businesses, typo-graphs with a long tradition of influence on political life, bistros and coffee shops, while closer to the river, there are fewer businesses. Architecture Santa Catarina is a nucleus of a rich heritage of architecture, not just in quantity, but also in the importance historically. Most of the buildings, if not the facades, are representative of the 18th Century-style construction, while many religious sanctuaries have longer histories. =Civic= * Pal√°cio Pombal () (IPA Monument Class.

Damdins√ºren was born in Sain Noyon Khan Aimag (present day Zavkhan Province). As a young child he studied Tibetan language and classical Mongolian script. At age 16 he became a clerk in the local government. In 1923 he was appointed chief of staff of the new rural district in present-day Uliastai. In 1925 he was elected as a delegate to the Fourth Congress of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League (MRYL). At this congress Damdinsuren was elected a member of the Presidium and head of the Central Committee of the MYRL. At the MPRP Fifth Congress he was elected member of the Great Hural which in turn elected him a member of the Small Khural. At the Sixth Party Congress in early 1927 he was re-elected Chairman of the MRYL and a member of the MPRP Central Committee. The Central Committee elected him as a member of the MPRP Presidium and he was then chosen as its Chairman, making him titular head of state of Mongolian People's Republic. Damdinsuren would hold this post from January 16, 1927 to January 23, 1929. In 1928 the MPRP Seventh Party Congress ushered in the \\"Leftist Period\\" that signaled a more aggressive approach to implementation of Soviet backed leftist policies such as more rapid collectivization, land expropriation, and persecution of the Buddhist Church. Soviet advisers arranged for Damdins√ºren to be replaced by the more pliable Khorloogiin Choibalsan, who was \\"kicked upstairs\\" to be Chairman of the Little Hural. Damdins√ºren was in turn named deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture and then minister of animal husbandry. In 1930, he was relieved of his duties as member of the MPRP Presidium of the Central Committee during the Eight Party Congress and named head of the propaganda department of the Secretariat of the Central Committee. During the collectivization campaigns of 1930‚Äì1931, he returned to Zavkhan Province where he took up position as secretary of the commune and the director of a collective farm. From 1931 to 1934 he returned to Ulaanbaatar to work as General Secretary of Cooperatives, but then he returned again to Zavkhan to head the department of the local co-operative production. From 1934 to 1938 Damdins√ºren was the second deputy chief of staff in Zavkhan Province and the head of the department of animal husbandry. In 1938 Damdins√ºren was accused of counterrevolutionary activity during Khorloogiin Choibalsan's Great Terror (1937-1939) and shortly thereafter he was executed.

In the foreground is a man in military dress on a horse, with other men and horses in the background. The use of horses in World War I marked a transitional period in the evolution of armed conflict. Cavalry units were initially considered essential offensive elements of a military force, but over the course of the war, the vulnerability of horses to modern weapons such as machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire greatly reduced their utility on the battlefield. This paralleled with the development of tanks, would ultimately replace cavalry in shock tactics role. While the perceived value of the horse in war changed dramatically, horses still played a significant role throughout the war. All of the major combatants in World War I (1914‚Äì1918) began the conflict with cavalry forces. Germany stopped using them on the Western Front soon after the war began, but continued with limited use on the Eastern Front, well into the war. The Ottoman Empire used cavalry extensively during the war. On the Allied side, the United Kingdom used mounted infantry and cavalry charges throughout the war, but the United States used cavalry only briefly. Although not particularly successful on the Western Front, Allied cavalry had some success in the Middle Eastern theatre against a weaker and less technologically-advanced enemy. Russia used cavalry forces on the Eastern Front but with limited success. The military used horses mainly for logistical support; they were better than mechanized vehicles at traveling through deep mud and over rough terrain. Horses were used for reconnaissance and for carrying messengers as well as for pulling artillery, ambulances, and supply wagons. The presence of horses often increased morale among the soldiers at the front, but the animals contributed to disease and poor sanitation in camps, caused by their manure and carcasses. The value of horses and the increasing difficulty of replacing them were such that by 1917, some troops were told that the loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier. Ultimately, the blockade of Germany prevented the Central Powers from importing horses to replace those lost, which contributed to Germany's defeat. By the end of the war, even the well-supplied US Army was short of horses. Conditions were severe for horses at the front; they were killed by artillery fire, suffered from skin disorders, and were injured by poison gas. Hundreds of thousands of horses died, and many more were treated at veterinary hospitals and sent back to the front. Procuring fodder was a major issue, and Germany lost many horses to starvation. Several memorials have been erected to commemorate the horses that died. Artists, including Alfred Munnings, extensively documented the work of horses in the war, and horses were featured in war poetry. Novels, plays and documentaries have also featured the horses of World War I.  Cavalry  Members of the Royal Scots Greys near Brimeux, France in 1918 Many British tacticians outside of the cavalry units realized before the war that advances in technology meant that the era of mounted warfare was coming to an end. However, many senior cavalry officers disagreed, and despite limited usefulness, maintained cavalry regiments at the ready throughout the war. Scarce wartime resources were used to train and maintain cavalry regiments that were rarely used. The continued tactical use of the cavalry charge resulted in the loss of many troops and horses in fruitless attacks against machine guns.Ellis, Cavalry, pp. 174‚Äì76 Early in the war, cavalry skirmishes occurred on several fronts, and horse- mounted troops were widely used for reconnaissance.Willmott, First World War, p. 46 Britain's cavalry were trained to fight both on foot and mounted, but most other European cavalry still relied on the shock tactic of mounted charges. There were isolated instances of successful shock combat on the Western Front, where cavalry divisions also provided important mobile firepower. Beginning in 1917, cavalry was deployed alongside tanks and aircraft, notably at the Battle of Cambrai, where cavalry was expected to exploit breakthroughs in the lines that the slower tanks could not. This plan never came to fruition due to missed opportunities and the use of machine guns by German forces. At Cambrai, troops from Great Britain, Canada, India and Germany participated in mounted actions.Hammond, Cambrai 1917, pp. 69, 450‚Äì51 Cavalry was still deployed late in the war, with Allied cavalry troops harassing retreating German forces in 1918 during the Hundred Days Offensive, when horses and tanks continued to be used in the same battles. In comparison to their limited usefulness on the Western Front, \\"cavalry was literally indispensable\\" on the Eastern front and in the Middle East. Great changes in the tactical use of cavalry were a marked feature of World War I, as improved weaponry rendered frontal charges ineffective. Although cavalry was used with good effect in Palestine, at the Third Battle of Gaza and Battle of Megiddo, generally the mode of warfare changed. Tanks were beginning to take over the role of shock combat. The use of trench warfare, barbed wire and machine guns rendered traditional cavalry almost obsolete.Carver, Britain's Army in the 20th Century, p. 123 Following the war, the armies of the world powers initiated a process of mechanization in earnest, and most cavalry regiments were either converted to mechanized units or disbanded.Carver, Britain's Army in the 20th Century, pp. 154‚Äì57 Historian G.J. Meyer writes that \\"the Great War brought the end of cavalry\\".Meyer, A World Undone, p. 264 From the Middle Ages into the 20th century, cavalry had dominated battlefields, but from as early as the American Civil War, their value in war was declining as artillery became more powerful, reducing the effectiveness of shock charges. The Western Front in World War I showed that cavalry was almost useless against modern weaponry, and it also reinforced that they were difficult to transport and supply. British cavalry officers, far more than their continental European counterparts, persisted in using and maintaining cavalry, believing that mounted troops would be useful for exploiting infantry breakthroughs, and under the right circumstances would be able to face machine guns. Neither of these beliefs proved correct. = British Empire =  United Kingdom  The alt=A large group of men and horses drawn up into lines in a field and on the adjoining road. A hill with trees and tents can be seen in the background. Britain had increased its cavalry reserves after seeing the effectiveness of mounted Boers during the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902).Dent, Cleveland Bay Horses, pp. 61‚Äì64 Horse-mounted units were used from the earliest days of World War I: on August 22, 1914, the first British shot of the war in France was fired by a cavalryman, Edward Thomas of the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, near Casteau, during a patrol in the buildup to the Battle of Mons. Within 19 days of Britain beginning mobilization for war, on August 24, 1914, the 9th Lancers, a cavalry regiment led by David Campbell, engaged German troops with a squadron of 4th Dragoon Guards against German infantry and guns. Campbell obeyed his orders to charge, although he believed the more prudent course of action would have been to fight dismounted. The charge resulted in a British loss of 250 men and 300 horses. On September 7, Campbell's troops charged again, this time towards the German 1st Guard Dragoons, another lancer cavalry regiment. In the same year, the British Household Cavalry completed their penultimate operation on horseback‚Äîthe Allied retreat from Mons. Upon reaching the Aisne River and encountering the trench system, cavalry was found ineffective. While cavalry divisions were still being formed in Britain, cavalry troops quickly became accustomed to fighting dismounted.Braddon, All the Queen's Men, pp. 187‚Äì88 Britain continued to use cavalry throughout the war, and in 1917, the Household Cavalry conducted its last mounted charge during a diversionary attack on the Hindenburg Line at Arras. On the orders of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the Life Guards and the Blues, accompanied by the men of the 10th Hussars, charged into heavy machine gun fire and barbed wire, and were slaughtered by the German defenders; the Hussars lost two-thirds of their number in the charge.Ellis, Cavalry, p. 176 The last British fatality from enemy action before the armistice went into effect was a cavalryman, George Edwin Ellison, from C Troop 5th Royal Irish Lancers. Ellison was shot by a sniper as the regiment moved into Mons on November 11, 1918. Despite their lackluster record in Europe, horses proved indispensable to the British war effort in Palestine, particularly under Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, for whom cavalry made up a large percentage of his forces. Most of his mounted troops were not British regular cavalry, but the Desert Mounted Corps, consisting of a combination of Australian, New Zealand, Indian units and English Yeomanry regiments from the Territorial Force, largely equipped as mounted infantry rather than cavalry. By mid-1918, Turkish intelligence estimated that Allenby commanded around 11,000 cavalry.Erickson, Ordered to Die, pp. 195‚Äì97 Allenby's forces crushed the Turkish armies in a running series of battles that included the extensive use of cavalry by both sides. Some cavalry tacticians view this action as a vindication of cavalry's usefulness, but others point out that the Turks were outnumbered two to one by late 1918, and were not first-class troops.Ellis, Cavalry, pp. 176‚Äì77 Horses were also ridden by the British officers of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps in Egypt and the Levant during the Sinai and Palestine Campaigns.McPherson, et al., The man who loved Egypt, pp. 184‚Äì86  India  Indian cavalry participated in actions on both the Western and Palestinian fronts throughout the war. Members of the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions were active on the Western Front, including in the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line and at the Battle of Cambrai. During the battle of the Somme, the 20th Deccan Horse made a successful, mounted charge, assaulting a German position on Bazentin Ridge. The charge overran the German position. A charge by the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Division ended successfully at the Battle of Cambrai despite being against a position fortified by barbed wire and machine guns. Such successful endings were unusual occurrences during the war.Hammond, Cambrai 1917, pp. 396‚Äì402 Several Indian cavalry divisions joined Allenby's troops in the spring of 1918 after being transferred from the Western Front.  Canada  Members of the Canadian Cavalry Brigade perform a cavalry charge during the Battle of Moreuil Wood. When the war began, Lord Strathcona's Horse, a Canadian cavalry regiment, was mobilized and sent to England for training. The regiment served as infantry in French trenches during 1915, and were not returned to their mounted status until February 16, 1916. In the defense of the Somme front in March 1917, mounted troops saw action, and Lieutenant Frederick Harvey was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions. Canadian cavalry generally had the same difficulties as other nations in breaking trench warfare deadlocks and were of little use on the front lines. However, in the spring of 1918, Canadian cavalry was essential in halting the last major German offensive of the war. On March 30, 1918, Canadian cavalry charged German positions in the Battle of Moreuil Wood, defeating a superior German force supported by machine gun fire. The charge was made by Lord Strathcona's Horse, led by Gordon Flowerdew, later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the charge. Although the German forces surrendered, three-quarters of the 100 cavalry participating in the attack were killed or wounded in the attack against 300 German soldiers.  Australia and New Zealand  The Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division (known as the ANZAC Mounted Division) was formed in Egypt in 1916, after the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) was disbanded. Comprising four brigades, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Australian Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. All had fought at Gallipoli dismounted. In August the division's dynamic capabilities were effectively combined with the static 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division at the Battle of Romani, where they repelled an attempted Ottoman attack on the Suez Canal. This victory stopped the advance of Kress von Kressenstein's Expeditionary Force (3rd Infantry Division and Pasha I formation) towards the Suez Canal and forced his withdrawal under pressure. An Ottoman garrison at Magdhaba was defeated in December 1916 by the division with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade attached and the other major Ottoman fortification at Rafah was captured in January 1917. They participated mounted in the First Battle of Gaza in March, and the Third Battle of Gaza (including the Battle of Beersheba) in October 1917. They attacked dismounted in the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917. In 1918, the ANZAC and Australian Mounted Divisions, along with the Yeomanry Mounted Division in the Desert Mounted Corps, conducted two attacks across the Jordan River to Amman in March, then moved on to Es Salt in April. The Australian Mounted Division were armed with swords mid year, and as part of the Battle of Megiddo captured Amman (capturing 10,300 prisoners), Nazareth, Jenin and Samakh in nine days. After the Armistice they participated in the reoccupation of Gallipoli in December.Falls Official History Egypt & Palestine Vol. 1 pp. 175‚Äì99, 376‚Äì77, p. 344, Vol. 2 Part I pp. 49‚Äì60, Part II pp. 547‚Äì54 Australian Imperial Force light horsemen, 1914alt=Two men carrying rifles on horseback; another horse and rider are partially visible in the background. The ANZAC and Australian Mounted Divisions carried rifles, bayonets and machine guns, generally using horses as swift transport and dismounting to fight.Pugsley, The Anzac Experience, p. 119 Troops of four men were organised, so that three were fighting while the fourth held the horses. Sometimes they fought as mounted troops: at the Battle of Beersheba during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in 1917, the Australian Mounted Division's 4th Light Horse Brigade made what is sometimes called \\"the last successful cavalry charge in history\\", when two regiments successfully overran Turkish trenches.See also First Transjordan attack on Amman (1918)#Bridgehead established for a description of the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment's mounted attack of Ottoman cavalry. They formed up over a wide area, to avoid offering a target for enemy artillery, and galloped into machine gun fire, equipped only with rifles and bayonets. Some of the front ranks fell, but most of the brigade broke through, their horses jumping the trenches into the enemy camp. Some soldiers dismounted to fight in the trenches, while others raced on to Beersheba, to capture the town and its vital water supplies.Mitchell, Light Horse, pp. 3‚Äì4 The charge was \\"instrumental in securing Allenby's victory [in Palestine]\\".Holmes, Military History, p. 188 The Australians primarily rode Waler horses. The English cavalry officer, Lieutenant Colonel RMP Preston DSO, summed up the animals' performance in his book, The Desert Mounted Corps: > ... (November 16th, 1917) The operations had now continued for 17 days > practically without cessation, and a rest was absolutely necessary > especially for the horses. Cavalry Division had covered nearly 170 miles ... > and their horses had been watered on an average of once in every 36 hours > ... The heat, too, had been intense and the short rations, lb of grain per > day without bulk food, had weakened them greatly. Indeed, the hardship > endured by some horses was almost incredible. One of the batteries of the > Australian Mounted Division had only been able to water its horses three > times in the last nine days‚Äîthe actual intervals being 68, 72 and 76 hours > respectively. Yet this battery on its arrival had lost only eight horses > from exhaustion, not counting those killed in action or evacuated wounded > ... The majority of horses in the Corps were Walers and there is no doubt > that these hardy Australian horses make the finest cavalry mounts in the > world ... = Continental Europe = Verdun. Italian veterinary technicians perform surgery on horse. Before the war began, many continental European armies still considered the cavalry to hold a vital place in their order of battle. France and Russia expanded their mounted military units before 1914. Of the Central Powers, Germany added thirteen regiments of mounted riflemen, Austria‚ÄìHungary expanded their forces,Keegan, The First World War, p. 20 and the Bulgarian army also readied the cavalry in their army.Erickson, Ordered to Die, p. 144 When the Germans invaded in August 1914, the Belgians had one division of cavalry. French cavalry had similar problems with horses on the Western Front as the British, although the treatment of their horses created additional difficulties. Opinion generally was that the French were poor horsemen: \\"The French cavalryman of 1914 sat on his horse beautifully, but was no horsemaster. It did not occur to him to get off his horse's back whenever he could, so there were thousands of animals with sore backs ...\\". One French general, Jean-Fran√ßois Sordet, was accused of not letting horses have access to water in hot weather.Herwig, The Marne, 1914, p. 261 By late August 1914, a sixth of the horses in the French cavalry were unusable.Jarymowycz, Cavalry from hoof to track, pp. 137‚Äì38 The French continued to eschew mounted warfare when in a June 1918 charge by French lancers the horses were left behind and the men charged on foot. Russia possessed thirty-six cavalry divisions when it entered the war in 1914, and the Russian government claimed that its horsemen would thrust deep into the heart of Germany. Although Russian mounted troops entered Germany, they were soon met by German forces. In the August 1914 Battle of Tannenberg, troops led by German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Lieutenant-General Erich Ludendorff surrounded the Russian Second Army and destroyed the mounted force of Don Cossacks that served as the special guard of Russian General Alexander Samsonov. Other Russian cavalry units successfully harassed retreating Austro-Hungarian troops in September 1914, with the running battle eventually resulting in the loss of 40,000 of the 50,000 men in the Austro-Hungarian XIV Tyrolean Corps, which included the 6th Mounted Rifle Regiment.Keegan, The First World War, p. 161 Transporting cavalry created a hardship for the already strained Russian infrastructure, as the great distances they needed to be moved meant that they had to be transported by train. Approximately the same number of trains (about 40) were required to transport a cavalry division of 4,000 as to transport an infantry division of 16,000.Ellis, Cavalry, pp. 177‚Äì78 The cavalries of the Central Powers, Germany and Austria‚ÄìHungary, faced the same problems with transport and the failure of tactics as the Russians.Ellis, Cavalry, p. 178 Germany initially made extensive use of cavalry, including a lance-against-lance battle with the British in late 1914, and an engagement between the British 1st Cavalry Brigade and the German 4th Cavalry Division in the lead-up to the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914. That battle ended \\"decidedly to the disadvantages of the German cavalry\\", partially due to the use of artillery by the accompanying British L Battery of horse artillery.Keegan, The First World War, p. 117 The Germans stopped using cavalry on the Western Front not long after the beginning of the war, in response to the Allied Forces' changing battle tactics, including more advanced weaponry. They continued to use cavalry to some extent on the Eastern Front, including probes into Russian territory in early 1915.Meyer, A World Undone, p. 321 The Austrians were forced to stop using cavalry because of large-scale equipment failures; Austrian military saddles were so poorly designed as to rub the skin off the back of any horse not already hardened to the equipment from parade ground practice; only a few weeks into the war half of all Austrian cavalry mounts were disabled, and the rest nearly so. = Ottoman Empire = Turkish cavalry south of Jerusalem in April 1917 In 1914, the Ottoman Turks began the war with one cavalry regiment in the Turkish army corps and four reserve regiments (originally formed in 1912) under the control of the Turkish Third Army. These reserve regiments were composed of Kurds, rural Turks and a few Armenians.Erickson, Ordered to Die, pp. 5‚Äì6 The performance of the reserve divisions was poor, and in March 1915 the forces that survived were turned into two divisions totalling only two thousand men and seventy officers. Later that month, the best regiments were consolidated into one division and the rest disbanded. Nonetheless, cavalry was used by Ottoman forces throughout 1915 in engagements with the Russians,Erickson, Ordered to Die, pp. 64, 105‚Äì07 and one cavalry unit even exchanged small arms fire with a submarine crew in the Dardanelles in early 1915. Turkish cavalry was used in engagements with the British, including the Third Battle of Gaza in late 1917. In this battle, both sides used cavalry forces as strategic parts of their armies.Erickson, Ordered to Die, pp. 172‚Äì74 Cavalry continued to be involved in engagements well into 1918, including in conflicts near the Jordan River in April and May that year, which the Ottomans called the First and Second Battles of Jordan, part of the lead-up to the Battle of Megiddo. By September 1918, regular army cavalry forces were stationed throughout the Turkish front, and the only remaining operationally ready reserve forces in the Ottoman military were two cavalry divisions, one formed after the initial problems in 1915. = United States = upright=.75 By 1916, the United States Cavalry consisted of 15,424 members organized into 15 regiments, including headquarters, supply, machine- gun and rifle troops.Urwin, The United States Cavalry, pp. 174‚Äì76 Just before formally joining the war effort, the US had gained significant experience in 1916 and 1917 during the Pancho Villa Expedition in Mexico, which helped to prepare the US Cavalry for entry into World War I. In May 1917, a month after the US declaration of war, the National Defense Act went into effect, creating the 18th through the 25th US Cavalry regiments, and later that month, twenty more cavalry regiments were created. However, British experiences during the first years of the war showed that trench warfare and weapons that included machine guns and artillery made cavalry warfare impractical. Thus, on October 1, eight of the new cavalry regiments were converted to field artillery regiments by order of Congress, and by August 1918, twenty National Army horse units were converted to thirty-nine trench mortar and artillery batteries. Some horse units of the 2nd, 3rd, 6th and 15th Cavalry regiments accompanied the US forces in Europe. The soldiers worked mainly as grooms and farriers, attending to remounts for the artillery, medical corps and transport services. It was not until late August 1918 that US cavalry entered combat. A provisional squadron of 418 officers and enlisted men, representing the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and mounted on convalescent horses, was created to serve as scouts and couriers during the St. Mihiel Offensive. On September 11, 1918, these troops rode at night through no man's land and penetrated five miles behind German lines. Once there, the cavalry was routed and had to return to Allied territory. Despite serving through the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, by mid- October the squadron was removed from the front with only 150 of its men remaining.Urwin, The United States Cavalry, pp. 179‚Äì80  Logistical support  alt=Two mules pulling a wagon loaded by supplies. A man rides one of the mules, while another man stands on the wagon. Horses were used extensively for military trains. They were used to pull ambulances, carry supplies and ordnance. At the beginning of the war, the German army depended upon horses to pull its field kitchens, as well as the ammunition wagons for artillery brigades.Keegan, The First World War, p. 77 The Royal Corps of Signals used horses to pull cable wagons, and the promptness of messengers and dispatch riders depended on their mounts. Horses often drew artillery and steady animals were crucial to artillery effectiveness. The deep mud common in some parts of the front, caused by damaged drainage systems flooding nearby areas, made horses and mules vital, as they were the only means of getting supplies to the front and guns moved from place to place. After the April 1917 Battle of Vimy Ridge, one Canadian soldier recalled, \\"the horses were up to their bellies in mud. We'd put them on a picket line between the wagon wheels at night and they'd be sunk in over their fetlocks the next day. We had to shoot quite a number.\\"Meyer, A World Undone, p. 531 Thousands of horses were employed to pull field guns; six to twelve horses were required to pull each gun. During the Battle of Cambrai, horses were used to recover guns captured by the British from no man's land. In one instance, two teams of sixteen horses each had their hooves, tack and pulling chains wrapped to reduce noise. The teams and their handlers then successfully pulled out two guns and returned them to British lines, the horses jumping a trench in the process and waiting out an artillery barrage by German troops on the road they needed to take.Hammond, Cambrai 1917, pp. 425‚Äì26 Dummy horses were sometimes used to deceive the enemy into misreading the location of troops. They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. Evidence exists that the Germans used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US are suspected of infecting cattle and horses bound for France with glanders, a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns in their ability to move artillery on the Eastern Front.Judson, Chemical and Biological Warfare, p. 68 The value of horses was known to all. In 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, men at the front understood that \\"at this stage to lose a horse was worse than losing a man because after all, men were replaceable while horses weren't.\\"  Procurement  = Allied forces = alt=A group of men unloading a horse from a ship thorough the use of a sling. Another horse is partially visible, while other men watch from the ground and the deck of the ship. To meet its need for horses, Britain imported them from Australia, Canada, the US, and Argentina, and requisitioned them from British civilians. Lord Kitchener ordered that no horses under should be confiscated, at the request of many British children, who were concerned for the welfare of their ponies. The British Army Remount Service, in an effort to improve the supply of horses for potential military use, provided the services of high quality stallions to British farmers for breeding their broodmares.Schafer, \\"Animals, Use of\\" in The European Powers in the First World War, p. 53 The already rare Cleveland Bay was almost wiped out by the war; smaller members of the breed were used to carry British troopers, while larger horses were used to pull artillery. New Zealand found that horses over fared worse than those under that height. Well-built Thoroughbreds of 15 hands and under worked well, as did compact horses of other breeds that stood . Larger crossbred horses were acceptable for regular work with plentiful rations, but proved less able to withstand short rations and long journeys. Riflemen with tall horses suffered more from fatigue, due to the number of times they were required to mount and dismount the animals. Animals used for draught work, including pulling artillery, were also found to be more efficient when they were of medium size with good endurance than when they were tall, heavy and long-legged.Reakes, The War Effort of New Zealand, p. 159 The continued resupply of horses was a major issue of the war. One estimate puts the number of horses that served in World War I at around six million, with a large percentage of them dying due to war-related causes. In 1914, the year the war began, the British Army owned only about 25,000 horses. This shortfall required the US to help with remount efforts, even before it had formally entered the war. Between 1914 and 1918, the US sent almost one million horses overseas, and another 182,000 were taken overseas with American troops. This deployment seriously depleted the country's equine population. Only 200 returned to the US, and 60,000 were killed outright. By the middle of 1917, Britain had procured 591,000 horses and 213,000 mules, as well as almost 60,000 camels and oxen. Britain's Remount Department spent ¬£67.5 million on purchasing, training and delivering horses and mules to the front. The British Remount Department became a major multinational business and a leading player in the international horse trade, through supplying horses to not only the British Army but also to Canada, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and even a few to the US. Shipping horses between the US and Europe was both costly and dangerous; American Expeditionary Force officials calculated that almost seven times as much room was needed per ton for animals than for average wartime cargo, and over 6,500 horses and mules were drowned or killed by shell fire on Allied ships attacked by the Germans. In turn, New Zealand lost around 3 percent of the nearly 10,000 horses shipped to the front during the war.Reakes, The War Effort of New Zealand, p. 154 Due to the high casualty rates, even the well-supplied American army was facing a deficit of horses by the final year of the war. After the American First Army, led by General John J. Pershing, pushed the Germans out of the Argonne Forest in late 1918, they were faced with a shortage of around 100,000 horses, effectively immobilizing the artillery. When Pershing asked Ferdinand Foch, Marshal of France, for 25,000 horses, he was refused. It was impossible to obtain more from the US, as shipping space was limited, and Pershing's senior supply officer stated that \\"the animal situation will soon become desperate.\\" The Americans, however, fought on with what they had until the end of the war, unable to obtain sufficient supplies of new animals.Gilbert, The First World War, pp. 477‚Äì79 = Central Powers = A horse-drawn German supply wagon in France in 1917 Before World War I, Germany had increased its reserves of horses through state-sponsored stud farms () and annuities paid to individual horse breeders. These breeding programs were designed specifically to provide high-quality horses and mules for the German military. These efforts, and the horse- intensive nature of warfare in the early 20th century, caused Germany to increase the ratio of horses to men in the army, from one to four in 1870 to one to three in 1914. The breeding programs allowed the Germans to provide all of their own horses at the beginning of the war. Horses were considered army reservists; owners had to register them regularly, and the army kept detailed records on the locations of all horses. In the first weeks of the war, the German army mobilized 715,000 horses and the Austrians 600,000. Overall, the ratio of horses to men in Central Powers nations was estimated at one to three.Keegan, The First World War, p. 73 The only way Germany could acquire large numbers of horses after the war began was by conquest. More than 375,000 horses were taken from German-occupied French territory for use by the German military. Captured Ukrainian territory provided another 140,000. The Ardennes was used to pull artillery for the French and Belgian armies. Their calm, tolerant disposition, combined with their active and flexible nature, made them an ideal artillery horse.Pinney, The Working Horse Manual, pp. 24‚Äì25 The breed was considered so useful and valuable that when the Germans established the Commission for the Purchase of Horses in October 1914 to capture Belgian horses, the Ardennes was one of two breeds specified as important, the other being the Brabant.Schafer, \\"Animals, Use of\\" in The European Powers in the First World War, p. 52 The Germans were not able to capture the horses belonging to the Belgian royal family, as they were successfully evacuated, although they captured enough horses to disrupt Belgian agriculture and breeding programs. Horses used for the transport of goods were also taken, resulting in a fuel crisis in Belgium the next winter as there were no horses to pull coal wagons. The Germans sold some of their captured horses at auction.Schafer, \\"Animals, Use of\\" in The European Powers in the First World War, pp. 52‚Äì53 Prevented by the Allies from importing remounts, the Germans ultimately ran out of horses, making it difficult for them to move supplies and artillery, a factor contributing to their defeat.  Casualties and upkeep  A horse undergoes treatment for a skin disease at a British veterinary hospital in 1916 Battle losses of horses were approximately 25 percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease and exhaustion accounted for the remainder. The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the initial stock numbers, mainly due to infection from the tsetse fly. On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the Crimean War, 120 percent in the Boer War and 10 percent in peacetime. During some periods of the war, 1,000 horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 Battle of Verdun between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun.Gilbert, The First World War, p. 235 By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the Clydesdale horses, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over the course of the war, Britain lost over 484,000 horses, one horse for every two men.Holmes, Military History, p. 417 A small number of these, 210, were killed by poison gas. Feeding horses was a major issue, and horse fodder was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries,Keegan, A History of Warfare, p. 308 including Britain.Holmes, Tommy, p. 163 Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated the amount of food they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive. Animals bolstered morale at the front, due to the soldiers' affection for them. Some recruitment posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses could also be a health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt.Stout, War Surgery and Medicine, p. 479 Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.Carbery, The New Zealand Medical Service in the Great War 1914‚Äì1918, p. 223 A horse undergoing an operation at a US Army veterinary hospital Many horses died as a result of the conditions at the front‚Äîof exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000 horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them.Reakes, The War Effort of New Zealand, pp. 155‚Äì57 British Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge.Blenkinsop, History of the Great War, pp. 79‚Äì81 During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.Blenkinsop, History of the Great War, p. 81 When the war ended, many horses were killed due to age or illness, while younger ones were sold to slaughterhouses or to locals, often upsetting the soldiers who had to give up their beloved mounts. There were 13,000 Australian horses remaining at the end of World War I, but due to quarantine restrictions, they could not be shipped back to Australia. Two thousand were designated to be killed, and the remaining 11,000 were sold, most going to India as remounts for the British Army. Of the 136,000 horses shipped from Australia to fighting fronts in the war, only one, Sandy, was returned to Australia. New Zealand horses were also left behind; those not required by the British or Egyptian armies were shot to prevent maltreatment by other purchasers.Pugsley, The Anzac Experience, p. 146 The horses left behind did not always have good lives‚Äîthe Brooke Trust was established in 1930 when a young British woman arrived in Cairo, only to find hundreds of previously Allied-owned horses living in poor conditions, having been sold to Egyptians after the cessation of the war. In 1934, the Old War Horse Memorial Hospital was opened by the trust, and is estimated to have helped over 5,000 horses that had served in World War I; as of 2011, the hospital continues to serve equines in the Cairo area.  Legacy  The alt=photograph The horse is the animal most associated with the war, and memorials have been erected to its service, including that at St. Jude on the Hill, Hampstead, which bears the inscription \\"Most obediently and often most painfully they diedfaithful unto death.\\" The Animals in War Memorial in London commemorates animals, including horses, that served with the British and their allies in all wars. The inscription reads: \\"Animals In War. This monument is dedicated to all the animals that served and died alongside British and allied forces in wars and campaigns throughout time. They had no choice.\\" In Minneapolis, a monument by Lake of the Isles is dedicated to the horses of the Minnesota 151st Field Artillery killed in battle during World War I. The men of the Australian Light Horse Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles who died between 1916 and 1918 in Egypt, Palestine and Syria are commemorated by the Desert Mounted Corps Memorial, or Light Horse Memorial, on Anzac Parade, in Canberra, Australia. The original version of this monument was in Port Said in Egypt, and was mostly destroyed during the 1956 Suez War. A piece from the original memorial, a shattered horse's head, was brought back to Australia and used as part of a new statue in the A is for Animals exhibition honoring animals who have served with the Australian military. The exhibition also contains the preserved head of Sandy, the only horse to return to Australia after the war. alt=A statue of two men and two horses stands atop a pedestal in a paved courtyard. Large trees provide a background. War artist Alfred Munnings was sent to France in early 1918 as an official war artist with the Canadian Cavalry Brigade. The Canadian Forestry Corps invited Munnings to tour their work camps in France after seeing some of his work at the headquarters of General Simms, the Canadian representative. He produced drawings, watercolors, and paintings of their work, including Draft Horses, Lumber Mill in the Forest of Dreux in 1918. Forty-five of his paintings were displayed at the Canadian War Records Exhibition at the Royal Academy, many of which featured horses in war. Numerous other artists created works that featured the horses of World War I, including Umberto Boccioni with Charge of the Lancers and Terence Cuneo with his celebrated postwar painting of the saving of the guns at Le Cateau during the Retreat from Mons. During World War I, artist Fortunino Matania created the iconic image Goodbye Old Man that would be used by both British and American organizations to raise awareness of the suffering of animals affected by war. The painting was accompanied by a poem, The Soldiers Kiss, that also emphasized the plight of the horse in war. Writing poetry was a means of passing the time for soldiers of many nations, and the horses of World War I figured prominently in several poems. In 1982, Michael Morpurgo wrote the novel War Horse, about a cavalry horse in the war. The book was later adapted into a successful play of the same name, and also into a screenplay, with the movie, released on December 25, 2011 in the United States.

U-30, built by the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius at Fiume, was launched in December 1916 and commissioned in February 1917. U-30 had a single hull and was just over in length. She displaced nearly when surfaced and over when submerged. Her two diesel engines moved her at up to on the surface, while her twin electric motors propelled her at up to while underwater. She was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a deck gun and a machine gun. U-30 sank no ships during her brief service career. She departed from Cattaro on 31 March 1917 and was never heard from again. She may have succumbed to a mine in the Otranto Barrage but her fate remains a mystery.  Design and construction  Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I.Gardiner, p. 341.

See: Gardiner, pp. 344, 354. After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.Halpern, p. 383. The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted here (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 22 January 2009. U-30 displaced surfaced and submerged. She had a single hull with saddle tanks,Gardiner, p. 181. and was long with a beam of and a draft of . For propulsion, she had two shafts, twin diesel engines of for surface running, and twin electric motors of for submerged travel. She was capable of while surfaced and while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for U-30 in Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921, the German UB II boats, upon which the U-27 class was based, had a range of over at surfaced, and at submerged. U-27-class boats were designed for a crew of 23‚Äì24. U-30 was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a complement of four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a 75 mm/26 (3.0 in) deck gun and an machine gun. After intricate political negotiations to allocate production of the class between Austrian and Hungarian firms, U-27 was ordered from Ganz Danubius on 12 October 1915. She was laid down on 9 March 1916 at Fiume and launched on 27 December.  Service career  U-30 began diving trials on 8 January 1917, and made her first underwater cruise on 27 January. On 1 February, she successfully reached a depth of in compression tests. Four days later she took on a crew for a training voyage, and made her way to Pola. At that port, on 21 January 1917, SM U-30 was commissioned into the Austro- Hungarian Navy under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Friedrich F√§hndrich. F√§hndrich, a 29-year-old native of Budapest, had previously served as commander of . U-30 departed on her first patrol on 26 February, for duty off Cape Matapan and the Gulf of Taranto. During the patrol, U-30 did not encounter any hostile ships, but did encounter a storm that caused extensive damage. Cutting short her cruise with damage to the parapet on her conning tower, a missing radio aerial, and a broken gyrocompass, U-30 arrived in Cattaro on 16 March for repairs. With the repairs complete, U-30 set out from Cattaro on 31 March and was never heard from again. Author Paul Halpern suggests that a mine in the Otranto Barrage might have been responsible.Halpern, p. 160. Authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast report that there is no evidence in Allied records to indicate the possible fate of the U-boat, and conclude that the fate of U-30 remains a mystery, and \\"is likely to remain so for ever\\".Gibson and Prendergast, p. 248, note 1. U-30 was not credited with the sinking of any ships in her brief career. She was also the only member of the U-27-class to be lost during the war.

The series was not networked, playing on different days of the week in London to other regions. It is about a top secret British Intelligence Unit. It receives orders from the Prime Minister, and without questioning proceeds to battle enemy spies, saboteurs, and others to protect the security of Great Britain and the Western Alliance. Format The Rat Catchers is an organisation based at Whitehall in Central London but officially didn't exist, being denied at the highest level as they worked with the greatest secrecy. The focus is on three major characters: *Peregrine Pascale Smith (portrayed by Gerald Flood) is an Oxford University-educated managing director with 12 years' experience under his belt. *Brigadier H. St. J. Davidson (portrayed by Philip Stone) is the emotionless analytical brains behind the group. *Richard William Hurst (portrayed by Glyn Owen), formerly a superintendent at Scotland Yard. The show begins with the arrival of Richard Hurst, the new recruit to the team, an ex-policeman who was said to have gone by the book whilst in the force. However, the secrecy in the organisation's setup finds Hurst somewhat out of step with the other two, including not really knowing which of the other two really has the authority. Officially, Hurst is an employee of Smith's company: Transworld Electronics, leading to some confusion; in episode 3, he is not sure whether Smith or the Brigadier is his boss. This antagonistic approach leads him to feel left out, a situation not helped by Brigadier Davidson insistence that Hurst knows only the bare minimum about the organisation and is keen to keep it that way. The Brigadier's catch phrase is \\"Say so, if you understand me.\\" which he repeats each time he sent Smith and Hurst on a mission to ensure his orders are carried out to the letter. This was mimicked on the single version recording of the theme tune which opens with the mimicked \\"Say Yes, if you understand me\\". The show aired in two series comprising 25 x 60-minute episodes. Stories continued over multiple episodes in two or three parts, with cliff-hanger endings.

Proposed DVD release NetworkDVD, as they were called at the time, announced \\"The Rat Catchers\\" as the subject of a forthcoming release feature, including a clip from the recovered series 1 episode \\"The Unwitting Courier\\", along with notification that more information would follow in due course. However, after a few weeks this page disappeared from their website and all linked mention of any potential DVD release was scrubbed from the website a few weeks afterwards. Surviving episodes It is believed that the only copies of episodes which have survived are 'Ticket to Madrid' and 'The Unwitting Courier'. The latter was spotted on a torrent site and apparently originated from a VHS copy of a 16mm film print obtained at a film convention.http://wipednews.com/2009/03/19/rat-catcher-caught-missing-episode- of-60s-spy-show-discovered/ In addition to the above, the action sequences from episode 23 (series 2) \\"The Heel of Achilles\\" survive as poor quality film copies. Theme tune Performed by pianist Johnny Pearson, the full-length recording of \\"The Rat Catchers theme\\" tune was released on [Columbia] DB 8751 ([EMI]). It failed to make the charts.

Also known as the Chapin Street Clinic, the Health Center provides health and dental care to those who do not have access to Medicare or Medicaid and cannot afford private health insurance. The Health Center employs one physician, two nurses, one medical assistant, one medical receptionist, one full-time Spanish interpreter, and two dental hygienists, a licensed clinical social worker, and a service fellow to serve approximately 600 patients. The Health Center is unique among indigent clinics in that it relies largely on the assistance of around 30 volunteer physicians and around 30 student and community volunteers to meet the needs of its patients.  History  The Health Center was founded in 1986 by Sister Maura Brannick, CSC. A Holy Cross Sister and a nurse, Sister Maura wanted to provide basic medical care to the needy residents of South Bend who had very little access to the city's medical services. Sister's vision was to staff a small clinic with nurses and to recruit one or two physicians to accept referrals for the sickest patients. Once word about Sister's idea spread, the response from physicians was much greater than she had hoped for. By its third month of operation, 12 physicians were volunteering their time at the small clinic and within a year plans were underway to move the clinic from the two car garage it had occupied and into a larger facility on Chapin Street. After moving to the new facility in 1989, both the number of patients and the number of volunteers grew until, in 1997, it was decided to build a new building to house the Health Center. When building the new facility, Sister Maura and the rest of the Clinic staff wanted the new Center to serve as a community center and not simply a Clinic. As a result, the Health Center also features a community meeting room, a food pantry, an exercise room, and a dental clinic in addition to its medical offerings. The Health Center moved into its new and current home in 1998.  Services  The Health Center is not a walk-in clinic but rather is set up as a physician's office. The Health Center provides each patients with a primary care physician who will treat and track the patient's health as long as they are at the Health Center. Each patient is assigned a specific physician to provide the continuity of care that is essential for a healthy doctor-patient relationship. The cost to the patient for each doctor's visit is $5. This payment includes the doctor's visit, any lab work or diagnostic studies ordered, specialty referrals, and the medications prescribed by the physician. Many specialists also volunteer at the Health Center. Specialties offered include cardiology, dermatology, endocrinology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and gynecology. Additionally, the Health Center has established relationships with physicians across the South Bend area, allowing the staff to refer patients to other physicians if the necessary services are not offered at the Health Center. The Health Center also houses a three room dental clinic that can perform most needed dental work and x-rays, excluding most cosmetic dentistry. The dental clinic is also staffed largely by volunteers, with 9 dentists currently donating their time. Dental visits cost $10 for each visit, though dentures are an additional charge.  Patient eligibility  The Health Center's mission is to provide healthcare for individuals who are unable to qualify for government healthcare but cannot afford private insurance. In order to be eligible to become a patient, therefore, an individual must live in St. Joseph County, have income at or below 150% of the poverty level, and cannot have Medicare, Medicaid, or health insurance. The application process includes an initial evaluation of eligibility and then a verification of the financial information provided by the applicant.  Volunteers  The backbone of the Health Center is its volunteers. Every month, close to 100 physician and non-physician volunteers donate their time to assist in the care of the Health Center's patients. Non-physician volunteers have their talents utilized in a variety of ways at the Health Center. Typical volunteer positions include signing in patients, answering telephones, filing, charting, and assisting patients in filling out necessary forms. The Health Center is very fortunate to have several schools and universities from which to draw students. Notre Dame, Saint Mary's College, Indiana University South Bend, Bethel College, and Moreau Seminary have all had students volunteer at the Health Center. Typically, 30-40 students come weekly to the Health Center every semester. Students are placed much as other non-physician volunteers, matching their skills and interests with the Health Center's needs. Often students have the opportunity to take the patients' vital signs and shadow doctors that come in. As a result, many students use their experience at the Health Center to learn more about medical professions. In addition to other volunteers, each year an internship at the Health Center is funded by the St. Joseph Valley Alumni Club of Notre Dame and St. Joseph Regional Medical Center. The internship began in 1993 when a former volunteer at the Clinic asked the Alumni Club and St. Joseph Hospital to fund a full-time position that would allow a student to learn more about caring for South Bend's medically underserved population. This internship is offered to a recent Notre Dame graduate who plans on applying or has already been accepted to medical school. The position was named after the famous Notre Dame graduate and physician Thomas Anthony Dooley III. The Tom Dooley Intern has a variety of responsibilities, ranging from directing student volunteers to rooming patients. The position is also meant to give the individual in-depth clinical experience with the goal of teaching them how to incorporate service into their medical vocation. The current Tom Dooley Intern is Kristen Lentsch, a 2019 graduate of the University of Notre Dame.

Biography Saunders was born in Philadelphia and sang in church from early age. He developed his style after David Ruffin of The Temptations and Marvin Junior of The Dells and, encouraged by family and friends, pursued a career in music. He formed his first group as a teenager which eventually merged into a neighborhood act called New Day. During a live performance, he was noticed by the Philadelphia singer, songwriter and producer Harold Melvin. Following a tour of England, Melvin recruited Saunders in 1982 to replace then lead singer David Ebo in his group Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes. They toured extensively overseas with acts like Billy Paul and The Three Degrees. During a London concert performance, Saunders was introduced as the new lead singer of Harold Melvin & Blue Notes. In 1984, Saunders sang lead on the international dance music hit \\"Today's Your Lucky Day\\" from the Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes' album Talk It Up (Tell Everybody).[ Album information at Billboard magazine] The album produced three Billboard R&B; chart hits, \\"Today's Your Lucky Day\\", \\"Don't Give Me Up\\" and \\"I Really Love You\\". Saunders also co-lead with Melvin on the track \\"What We Both Need (Is Love)\\" which was popular on the local Philadelphia radio station WDAS-FM. The Talk It Up (Tell Everybody) album was recorded at Alpha International Studios in Philadelphia. The vocal line-up included Saunders with Melvin, Bill Spratley, Dwight \\"Blackey\\" Johnson and Rufus Thorne. The video for \\"Today's Your Lucky Day\\" which featured the female vocalist Nikko, was filmed at a transformed club in south Philadelphia designed to look like a Las Vegas-style casino.

He was the third but second surviving son of Frederick III, Duke of Liegnitz, by his wife Katharina, daughter of Henry V, Duke of Mecklenburg. He was named after his brother Frederick, who died in 1551, one year before his birth. Life In December 1571 he was named co- ruler of the Duchy of Liegnitz, under the tutelage of his brother Henry XI. Frederick IV decided to use the commitment to Henry XI in the religious war in France to be released from the guardianship of his brother. He went to the Emperor Maximilian II, asking a review of his divisionary treaty. Special Commissioners under imperial decree on 13 March 1576 that Frederick IV was the sole ruler of Liegnitz and one month later, on 17 April, he formally took possession of the government. Frederick IV was obliged to provide Henry XI's family, who remained in Silesia, to all their needs and, included cash and food. At the same time the date of the formal division of Liegnitz was set on 29 September 1577. However, this didn't happen, because Emperor Maximilian II died on 12 October 1576, and the new Emperor, Rudolf II, tried to re-examine the case. On 5 October 1580 the Emperor issued a favorable sentence against the elder brother, canceling the 17 April 1576 Decree. The brothers were named again co-rulers of the Duchy. Henry XI made his official residence in Liegnitz, and Frederick IV was forced to retired to Haynau (Chojn√≥w). The situation changed in the following year, when the insubordination of Henry XI (who even refused to pay homage) led to the intervention of the imperial troops. Despite his victory, Henry XI had to obtain forgiveness and decided to appear in Prague, but Rudolf II decided to deprive him of the government. Legnica was given again to Frederick IV as a sole ruler, but was required (like the first time) to ensure all the needs of the family of Henry XI (who remained as an Imperial prisoner), paying them the sum of 30 talers for week. Marriages and Issue On 20 January 1587, Frederick IV married firstly with Maria Sidonia (b. 10 May 1572 - d. 3 October 1587), daughter of Wenceslaus III Adam, Duke of Cieszyn. They had one daughter: #Maria Katharina (b. 17 September 1587 - d. 20 September 1587). On 23 November 1589, Frederick IV married secondly with Dorothea (b. Kolding, 16 October 1569 - d. Legnica, 5 July 1593), daughter of John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg. They had two children: #A son (b. and d. 25 May 1592). #A son (b. and d. 25 June 1593). On 24 October 1594, Frederick IV married thirdly with Anna (b. Stuttgart, 12 June 1561 - d. Haynau, 7 July 1616), daughter of Christoph, Duke of W√ºrttemberg and widow of Duke John George of Ohlau. They had no children. After his death without surviving male issue, Frederick IV was succeeded by his cousin Joachim Frederick, eldest son of George II the Pious.

Getzien (sometimes spelled Getzein) (February 14, 1864 ‚Äì June 19, 1932)https://www.mlb.com/player/pretzels-getzien-114733 was an American professional baseball player from 1883 to 1891. He played all or parts of nine seasons in Major League Baseball with four different National League teams from 1884 to 1891. He was the first German in MLB history. Getzien was known by the nickname \\"Pretzels\\". \\"Pretzels Getzien\\" Sources conflict as to whether the nickname was derived from his German ethnicity or from the belief that he was able to throw a \\"double curve\\" following \\"the curves of a pretzel.\\" During nine major league seasons, Getzien compiled a 145-139 win-loss record and a 3.46 earned run average (ERA). He threw 277 complete games, a total that ranks 58th in major league history. Only three pitchers threw more complete games in major league careers shorter than Getzien's nine-year career. Getzien had his most extensive playing time with the Detroit Wolverines, compiling records of 30-11 and 29-13 in 1886 and 1887. In the 1887 World Series (which Detroit won, 10 games to 5), Getzien pitched six complete games and compiled a 4-2 record with a 2.48 ERA. He also won 23 games for the Boston Beaneaters in 1890. Early years Getzien was born in 1868, but sources are in conflict as to whether he was born in Chicago or Germany. Getzien began playing baseball as a boy in Chicago. He played as an amateur in the Chicago City League. Professional baseball =The \\"Pretzel Curve\\"= During his career, Getzein's drew acclaim for his curveball. Getzein's version of the pitch was sometimes referred to as the \\"pretzel curve.\\"(\\"Getzein's 'pretzel curves' are again effective, now that he is through with the Chicagos for a while.\\") Sporting Life described Getzein's unusual delivery as follows: \\"In delivering his 'pretzels' 'Getz' faces third base with one foot in either corner of the lower end of the box. Bending the left knee slightly, he draws his right arm well back. Then, straightening up quickly, he slides the left foot forward with a characteristic little skip, and, bringing his arm around with a swift overhand swing, drives the ball in at a lively pace.\\" After a Getzein victory over the Kansas City Cowboys in 1886, the Detroit Free Press wrote: \\"The Pretzel is all right. He went into the box to-day and pitched one of his finest, his curves circling around in the form of the delicious pastry from which Getz takes his sobriquet.\\" However, the editor of the Grand Rapids World opined that Getzein's \\"curved ball\\" was a fiction. He wrote: > \\"The baseball enthusiasts claim for Getzein that he is able to so pitch a > ball that it will describe the arc of a circle on a horizontal plane before > reaching the catcher, and that therein lies the secret of his marvelous > pitching . . . Scientifically, this theory is utterly absurd. The forces > that act upon a ball pitched by Getzein are not different from those which > operate upon a projectile thrown from any other source, and the results must > be the same, and governed by the same laws. The curves are in the > imagination of Getzein's admirers. When the ball leaves his hand it is > beyond his control, and it moves forward from the impulse last given it as > it leaves his hand. It is then controlled by the force of propulsion, the > resistance of the atmosphere, and gravitation. . . . Getzein's antic and > deceptive motions may deceive the batter, so that he is unable to discover > the exact course of the ball in time to strike it, but he cannot throw a > ball so as to make a curve on the horizontal plane.\\" The Scientific American magazine responded in July 1886 by publishing an article written by Henry Chadwick (accompanied by several diagrams, two of which are reproduced above) explaining the physics behind the curve ball pitch. In 1891, O. P. Caylor in Outing magazine examined \\"The Theory and Introduction of Curve Pitching\\" and noted that many \\"ignorant ball players\\" had believed that Getzein was capable of throwing a \\"double curve.\\" Caylor deemed the \\"double curve\\" to be \\"an ocular delusion\\", but claimed that Getzein's nickname was based on the delusion: \\"[W]e have the nickname of 'the Pretzel Pitcher,' given to Getzein by players who imagine the curve from his hands comes at them with the curves of a pretzel.\\" Getzein was known by the nickname \\"Pretzels\\". Sources conflict as to whether the nickname was derived from his German ethnicity or from the belief that he was able to throw a \\"double curve\\" following \\"the curves of a pretzel.\\" =Grand Rapids= 1888 Old Judge baseball card for Getzein Getzein was listed at 5 feet, 10 inches, and 172 pounds, and he batted and threw right-handed. In 1882, Getzein made his professional baseball debut with the Grand Rapids, Michigan, team in the Northwestern League. According to an account published in The Sporting News, he \\"pitched his puzzling twisters and curves in the Northwestern League while that organization was in existence.\\" During the 1884 season, Getzein started and completed 30 games, and threw 11 shutouts, for Grand Rapids, compiling a record of 27‚Äì4 win‚Äìloss record with a 0.52 earned run average (ERA). =Detroit Wolverines= On August 9, 1884, the Grand Rapids team was dropped from the Northwestern League and disbanded. Jack Chapman, manager of the Detroit Wolverines, seized the opportunity to sign five former Grand Rapids players, including \\"what is known as the 'G' battery  Getzein and Gastfield.\\" The Detroit Free Press reported that Getzein \\"has been a formidable man to face in the Northwestern League, in one instance striking out sixteen batters.\\" Getzein made his major league debut at Detroit's Recreation Park on August 13, 1884. Getzein faced Cleveland and did not allow an earned run. The Detroit Free Press took note of Getzein's performance: > \\"Getzien caused the Cleveland batters to pound the air thirty-seven times, > and eleven more strikes were called. It is a great record, and one that is > seldom equaled. He had great speed at the outset, and struck out six of the > first eight men who came to the bat. He could not maintain the pace, > however, and was not so effective in the latter portion of the game, but was > sufficiently so to prevent any one from earning a run.\\" Despite Getzein's pitching performance, Detroit lost the game by a 1‚Äì0 score as Cleveland scored an unearned run. Getzein went on to start (and complete) 17 games for the Wolverines during the remaining two months of the 1883 season. He posted a 5‚Äì12 record for a Detroit team that finished in last place in the National League with a 28‚Äì84 record, 56 games out of contention. Getzein provided one of the few highlights for the 1884 Wolverines, pitching a six-inning no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies on October 1, 1884.(\\"October 1 Charlie Getzein (Detroit NL) hurls a 6-inning no-hitter against Philadelphia‚Äö winning‚Äö 1‚Äì0.\\") The Detroit Free Press reported on Getzein's no-hitter as follows: > \\"When Spalding compiles the history of remarkable games for his Guide for > 1885, it will embrace the fact that in the Detroit-Philadelphia game of > October 1 Getzien, the Detroit pitcher, was not batted for a base ‚Äì a feat > seldom accomplished. It should contain further fact that of eighteen men at > bat he struck out ten, and of the other eight but one hit the ball beyond > the diamond ‚Äì Purcell, in the first inning, a fly to Weidman. Of the other > seven, only three hit to the diamond, or a total of four balls struck inside > the foul lines. Of the eighteen, [Detroit catcher] Gastfield put out eleven > and threw out three others, Bennett, Scott and Weidman each had a fly, and > Jones threw one out at first.\\" Getzein finished the 1884 season with a 1.95 ERA, third best in the National League behind Old Hoss Radbourn (1.38) and Charlie Sweeney (1.95), both of whom played for the league champion Providence Grays. Over the course of the full 1884 season, pitching for both Grand Rapids and Detroit, Getzein started and completed 47 games and pitched 423-1/3 innings. In 1885, Getzein compiled a 12‚Äì25 record as his ERA jumped to 3.03. His record in 1885 was again impacted by playing with an noncompetitive team. The 1885 Wolverines finished the season in sixth place with a 41‚Äì67 record. In 1886, Getzein and the Wolverines saw their fortunes rise as the Wolverines assembled one of the best hitting teams in National League history featuring, among others, Dan Brouthers, Sam Thompson, Hardy Richardson, and Jack Rowe. Despite having a 3.03 ERA (precisely the same as his 1885 performance), Getzein won a career- high 30 victories against 11 losses. Getzein was not the Wolverines' leading pitcher in 1886, as teammate Lady Baldwin led the National League with 42 wins. The 1886 Wolverines finished in second place, 2¬Ω games behind the Chicago White Stockings, with an 87‚Äì36 record and a .707 winning percentage. In 1887, Getzein was the leading pitcher on a Detroit Wolverines team that won the National League pennant and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. Getzein compiled a 29‚Äì13 record and a 3.73 ERA, leading the league in winning percentage (.690) but also in home runs allowed (24). In September 1887, a group of influential fans in Detroit contributed money to purchase \\"an elegant two hundred dollar gold watch and chain\\" for Getzein to express their admiration for Getzein's \\"magnificent work for the club.\\" In the 1887 World Series (which Detroit won, 10 games to 5), Getzein pitched six complete games and compiled a 4‚Äì2 record with a 2.48 ERA. On October 17, 1887, Getzein pitched a no-hitter through the first eight innings in Game 10 of the World Series played before 10,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds in New York. The Detroit Free Press wrote: \\"Getzien made a remarkable showing. Up to and including the eighth inning only twenty-seven men went to the bat and not a clean hit had been scored. Not till the ninth did the world beaters succeed in getting a hit, and then they failed to score the much desired run.\\" 1888 baseball card for Getzein In 1888, Getzein compiled an 18‚Äì22 record and a 3.05 ERA. He started 46 games and completed 45 of them with 404 innings pitched. However, Getzein lost his role at the team's leading pitcher, as Pete Conway compiled a 30‚Äì14 record and a 2.25 ERA for the 1888 Wolverines. After Getzein gave up 10 runs in an August 1888 game against Washington, the Detroit Free Press dubbed him the \\"Pulverized Pretzel.\\" The newspaper reported: \\"The Detroits were defeated again to-day ... simply because Getzein could not keep the ball away from the Senatorial bat. When he pitched high they hit it. When he delivered his famous drop, he was knocked out of the lot, and his in and out curves were as big as balloons to Ted Sullivan's men.\\" As the 1888 season progressed, relations between Getzein and the Detroit manager became strained. After a game in which Getzein gave up 21 hits against Boston, The Sporting Life reported on speculation that Getzein may have intentionally thrown the game: > \\"The Getzein episode makes Detroiters weary. The Bostons have no license to > make 21 hits off the Pretzel when he pitches his game. Either he was not in > condition to pitch or he didn't try to. . . . If the latter, and he repeated > his performance against the Kansas Citys a few years ago, when he > deliberately tossed the balls to the plate and permitted the Cowboys to make > 13 runs in one inning, why no one here would mourn much if he was fined to > the limit. What the merits of his quarrel with Watkins are of course are not > known here. But Getzein is inclined to be very free with his tongue. > Considering his fine treatment here it is time for him to get over his > childish humors and do the best he knows how whenever called on.\\" =Later years= Getzein's career with the Wolverines ended after the 1888 season. On March 5, 1889, he was sold by Detroit to the Indianapolis Hoosiers.(\\"Pretzel Getzien will pitch for Indianapolis next season. When Getz loses his head among the Hoosiers a circus with six rings will ensue.\\") During the 1889 season, he compiled an 18‚Äì22 record and a 4.54 ERA for the Hoosiers and led the National League in home runs allowed with 27. After a sub par season with the Hoosiers, Getzein was acquired by the Boston Beaneaters in March 1890\\\\. He returned to good form in 1890, compiling a 23‚Äì17 record with a 3.19 ERA for the fifth-place Beaneaters. While pitching for Detroit in 1887, Getzein was teamed up with catcher Charlie Ganzel, and the pair became known as the \\"Pretzel Battery\\" because of their shared German ethnicity.(\\"A noted team of bygone days was composed of Getzein and Ganzel  the pretzel battery they were called when they played for the Detroits in 1887. The alliteration perhaps helped in keeping them before the public as a battery, but of course only slightly as compared to their usefuleness.\\") When Getzein signed with Boston in 1890, he was reunited with Ganzel. The Sporting Life reported: \\"The signing of Getzein by the Boston League Club re-unites the famous 'Pretzel Battery,' Getzein and Ganzel, of the Detroit ex-champions.\\" Getzein began the 1891 season with Boston, but he was released by the team on July 16, 1891, after compiling a 4‚Äì5 record in nine starts. He attempted a comeback with the Cleveland Spiders in August 1891, but he appeared in only one game for the Spiders, allowing nine runs in nine innings. He concluded his major league career appearing in 13 games for the St. Louis Browns in 1892. In 1894, Getzein was reported to be playing first base for a Chicago City League team. =Career statistics= During nine major league seasons, he compiled a 145‚Äì139 record and a 3.46 earned run average (ERA) in 296 games. He totaled 292 games started and threw 277 complete games, a total that ranks 58th in major league history. Only three pitchers in major league history (Ed Morris, Mark Baldwin, and Hall of Famer Albert Spalding) threw more complete games in careers shorter than Getzein's nine-year career. Getzein's record for complete games is based in part on the customs of the 1880s. In 1915, Baseball Magazine reported that managers were not allowed to freely pull the starting pitcher from a game in the bygone era. It cited an incident involving Getzein to illustrate the old practice: > \\"The Nationals got onto Getzein in the fourth inning and batted him all over > the field. In the fifth inning they kept up the slugging until Getzein said > he was ill, and Manager Hanlon wanted the Nationals to allow Getzein to > retire, claiming that he was too sick to play. Baker, captaining the home > club, said he would call a doctor and have him examine Getzein, and if the > latter was really sick he would probably allow the change to be made. Dr. > Bond, who happened to be present, was called on, and he examined the > pitcher, while the crowd guyed Getzein terribly. The doctor announced that > he did not consider Getzein sick, only discouraged at the pounding he had > received, and that he would be able to finish the game.\\" Family and death Getzien was married to Rose Dibble. He died in June 1932 after suffering a heart attack at his home in Chicago. He was buried at Concordia Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois.

Biography Born in Alsace in 1858, Charles Fr√©d√©ric Mew√®s grew up a Parisian after his family fled the Prussian invasion of 1870. RIBA Journal described him as \\"essentially a big man, both mentally and physically. He was a magnetic personality with a compelling influence tempered by a humorous and tolerant outlook on life\\". He trained under Jean-Louis Pascal at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and throughout his career, eschewed Art Nouveau and the Modern style for an elegant, meticulous recall of eighteenth- century France: the logical, spatial symmetry of Louis XVI recurs continuously. Mew√®s's hotels, steamer interiors, clubs, and private residences suited the Edwardians' opulent taste. He designed Ritz Hotels in Paris (1898), London (1905-1906), and Madrid (1908-1910); he was also the designer behind Maria Cristina hotel in San Sebasti√°n (completed in 1912). The London Ritz was one of Britain's earliest steel-framed buildings. Subsequently, he undertook the design of Pall Mall's largest club, the Royal Automobile Club (1910) which featured a \\"Pompeiian\\" swimming bath adapted from the earlier l'Etablissement Hydromin√©ral (1899-1900) at Contr√©xeville. His first maritime interior, the Hamburg America Line's SS Amerika was completed in 1905; the company so admired it that Mew√®s became their resident designer. On three German ships he incorporated a Pompeiian pool, although not on his last vessel, Cunard's Aquitania (1914). Although Mew√®s only spoke French, he opened firms in both London and Cologne, Germany, with Arthur Joseph Davis, who had been his classmate at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and with the Swiss Alphonse Bischoff. A brilliant and cultured man, Charles Mew√®s owned an extensive library, especially in the design field. In October 1947 the journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects described him as \\"The true type of the French intellectual of good stock\\". He designed many admired buildings, including the colossal Ch√¢teau Rochefort-en-Yvelines, the Jules Ferry residence and his own residence at 36 Boulevard des Invalides in Paris. He himself became a teacher and taught many students from all over the world. Charles Mew√®s bought the small castle of Scharrachbergheim in Alsace, where he spent much time with his three children after the death of his wife in 1896. He died in Paris in 1914.

Their primary purpose was to act as bodyguards for the emperors and other important nobles. They were divided into two groups: the day guard (Torguud) and the night guard (Khevtuul). They were distinct from the regular army and would not go to battle with them, instead staying back on guard duty. Their supreme commander was called the Cherbi. Because the Mongol Empire spanned most of Eurasia, its impacts on Mongol controlled-areas led to the creation of imperial guards like the Keshik. Khishig was the term used for the palace guards of the Great Mogul Emperors in India, and also for the matchlocks and sabres, which were changed weekly from Akbar the Great's armoury for the royal use. The royal guards in Persia who watched the King's person at night were also called Keshikchi.Henry Hoyle Howorth History of the Mongols: From the 9th to the 19th Century, p.399 The modern Mongolian Khishigten clan, believed to be their descendants, now inhabit Heshigten Banner within Inner Mongolia in China. History The assassination of the leaders of rival Mongol tribes was a common occurrence thanks to the ever-shifting loyalties and conflicting interests at play within Mongol tribal politics. The father of Genghis Khan, Yesugei, for example, was unwittingly poisoned by one of his enemies. The risk was especially high at night since the ger that Mongol nomads traditionally sleep in lacked a solid wall, and so a sword or spear could easily penetrate the walls and kill the subject inside. As a result, the Mongol monarch in Mongolia typically had personal guards. The Kerait khan Toghoril (Wang Khan) had an imperial guard, Torguud. According to an oral tradition, their descendants could be Torghut people. After the defeat of Wang Khan in 1203, Genghis established the kheshig. The kheshig consisted mainly of sworn personal followers.David Christian A history of Russia, Central Asia, and Mongolia, p.396 At first, this consisted of 70 day guards (Torguud or tunghaut) and 80 night guards (khevtuul).Stephen G. Haw Marco Polo's China, p.166 During the reign of Genghis, it seems to have been divided into four groups, commanded by the four generals Mukhulai, Chormaqan, Bo'orchu and Borokhula. Members of the kheshig outranked almost any other military officers in the Mongol Empire. As it was extremely well paid, the vocation was a popular one, and the numbers of Kheshig grew rapidly, to the extent that they were only normally on duty for three days in succession. In light of this, the word kheshig refers favor or blessing in the Mongolian language. Membership in the kheshig was regarded as a supreme honor and was an alternative to the necessity of hostage taking for noblemen.George Lane Daily life in the Mongol empire, p.97 In the early days the guard was composed of 1,000 men. By the middle of Genghis Khan's reign, they had expanded to a tumen (10,000 men) commanded by Nayagha, an uncle of Bayan of the Baarin.Richard A. Gabriel The great armies of antiquity, p.337 The Kheshig was originally consisted Mongolian, Manchurian, Han and Kazakh. As the Empire expanded rapidly, Genghis Khan's successors recruited Persian, Georgian, Armenian, Alan, Korean, Italian and Russian units.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, p.111David M. Farquhar The Government of China Under Mongolian Rule: A Reference Guide p.272Otto Harrassowitz Archivum Eurasiae medii aeivi [i.e. aevi]., p.36 Since the kheshig was personal appanage of a monarch, his successors did not inherit them. Instead, the kheshigs of deceased Emperors took care of their lords' families and assisted households. But G√ºy√ºk Khan took most of his father √ñgedei's old kheshig. Kublai Khan (r.1260-1294) restricted the functions of kheshig, and created a new imperial bodyguard. However, his kheshig were still ruled by descendants of Genghis Khan's four assistants. He had a body guard of 12,000 kheshigs.Henry Hoyle Howorth History of the Mongols: From the 9th to the 19th Century, p.398 Units =Primary units= *Torguud (Tunghaut) are the day guard of the Mongol khans.

Rodd served in a number of ships, including under Admiral Sir Charles Cotton and during the Battle of the Basque Roads. In 1809, he married the daughter of James Rennell and in 1825 was promoted to rear-admiral, later advancing to vice-admiral and knighted. He died in 1838. Life Little is known of Rodd's early life, but during the French Revolutionary Wars he served as a commander in the sloops and . In the former he participated in the capture of the French privateer Le Poisson Volant in the West Indies on 4 August 1796, and in the latter he captured the Dutch privateer Courier, for which was promoted to post captain on 7 September 1798. After the Peace of Amiens in 1803, Rodd briefly took command of the first rate ship of the line under Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, but by 1805 had moved to the veteran frigate . In Indefatigable, Rodd served as the main scout for the British squadron blockading Brest, France. In 1805 he sighted the French fleet under Admiral Ganteaume attempting to escape and warned the Offshore Squadron, who drove the French back into Brest in a brief engagement.James, Vol. 3, p. 302 In 1806, Rodd was working in conjunction with Captain Lord Cochrane in and on 15 July Indefatigable was the launch point for a fleet of small boats that attacked a French convoy in the Gironde.James, Vol. 4, p. 247 In early 1809, Rodd gained information concerning the departure of the French frigate Ni√©men from Brest, which led to her capture in early April. The same month, Indefatigable was heavily engaged at the Battle of Basque Roads, in which the French fleet in Brest was driven onto shoals by fireships launched by Cochrane who then attacked. Cochrane was inadequately supported by Admiral Lord Gambier and as a result only five French ships were destroyed instead of the entire fleet. Throughout the battle Rodd was heavily engaged with superior enemy forces, closely supporting Cochrane's attack.James, Vol. 5, p. 118 In the summer of 1809 he was called as a witness at the Court-martial of James, Lord Gambier which assessed whether Gambier had failed to support Cochrane at the battle. Gambier was controversially cleared of all charges. He left Indefatigable soon afterwards. In 1809, Rodd married Jane Rennell, daughter of Major James Rennell, a noted geographer who often assisted her father in his work. In 1814, Rodd moved to the ship of the line but was placed in reserve at the end of the war in the same year. In 1825, Rodd was promoted to be a Rear-Admiral of the Red, and on 20 February 1832 he was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

G. Wodehouse. The story was first published in the 24 January 1925 issue of the Saturday Evening Post in the United States, and in the February 1925 issue of the Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom. Wodehouse subsequently added a framing device in which the story is told by the character of Mr. Mulliner. It is this version which appears in the 1927 short story collection Meet Mr. Mulliner, and subsequent Wodehouse collections. Considered by Wodehouse himself to be one of his funniest stories, the story has been viewed as a homage to the writer Henry James. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein thought it the funniest thing he had ever read, according to his memoir. Plot Mr Mulliner tells the following story about his distant cousin James Rodman, a mystery novelist who, according to Mulliner, spent some weeks in a house haunted by the influence of a romance novelist. James Rodman receives an inheritance from his late aunt, romance novelist Leila J. Pinckney, consisting of five thousand pounds and her house in the country, Honeysuckle Cottage. She wrote many sentimental romance stories there. Her will states that James must reside in Honeysuckle Cottage for six months in every year, or he forfeits the money. James moves into the cottage. According to Mr Mulliner, Leila Pinckney had disapproved of James Rodman's detective stories. She put the clause in her will because she believed in the influence of environment and wanted James to move away from London. Generally, James likes the house, though he is annoyed by William, a noisy mixed-breed dog. In the cottage, James works on a mystery novel, The Secret Nine. He is perplexed to find himself writing a love interest into the novel and tries to keep her out of the story. An admirer of Pinckney's novels, Rose Maynard, visits the house. She is injured when struck by a car outside the cottage gates, and James reluctantly lets her recover at the house. The doctor and housekeeper act as if they are in a Pinckney novel and encourage a romance between them. James becomes concerned that the house is haunted, not by his aunt but by her influence. Even Rodman's tough literary agent Andrew McKinney becomes sentimental when visiting the cottage. James feels that the house will compel him to propose to Rose. A confirmed bachelor, he struggles against this unwelcome fate. Colonel Henry Carteret, Rose's guardian, arrives. It was Rose's father's dying wish that she should marry Carteret. After James rescues Rose's little dog Toto from the river, though the dog apparently could swim anyway, Rose tells Carteret she will not marry him. Carteret accepts that Rose has chosen James, to James's dismay. James resists proposing to Rose, but this angers Carteret, who thinks James may be trifling with her affections and intimidates James into proposing. James is appalled to hear himself speaking like a Pinckney character as he proposes to Rose. William interrupts him by causing hot tea to spill on his trousers, and chases Rose's dog. James chases William. Far from the cottage, James catches up to William. When William licks his face, James realizes that William saved him. They flee together to London, and are now inseparable companions. Background According to Robert McCrum, \\"Honeysuckle Cottage\\" is a parody of popular novelettes and was also influenced by Wodehouse's interest in spiritualism. Seances were popular during the inter-war years in England, and Wodehouse attended a seance in 1924, another in January 1925, and a third in April 1925. McCrum writes that Wodehouse was generally agnostic, but was interested in mystical subjects. In an article published in The Henry James Review, Marijane R. Davis Wernsman writes that there are parallels between the story and Henry James's novel The Turn of the Screw (1898), which is mentioned by name early in \\"Honeysuckle Cottage\\". For example, each story is told by an uninvolved narrator and concerns an isolated haunted house that is near London but in the countryside. Wernsman also states that Wodehouse derived some of the names of characters in the story from Henry James. Colonel Carteret's first name is Henry, and the main character's first name is James. Carteret is also the name of a character in Henry James's The Tragic Muse (1890) who convinces the hero, a younger man, to marry.

Since 2007, Starter has been a subsidiary company of the Iconix Brand Group, after it acquired the company to Nike, Inc..NIKE SELLS STARTER TO ICONIX BRAND GROUP on Nike Inc. website, 15 Nov 2007 History =Rise and expansion= Starter was founded in New Haven, Connecticut by David Beckerman, a University of New Haven alumnus, to manufacture team uniforms for high school athletic programs.\\"This Coach Knows Clothes\\", Sports Illustrated, 1997-03-10 In 1976, the company entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with a number of professional sports leagues, paying royalties of 8‚Äì10% for the right to manufacture and market copies of professional athletic apparel. Its first retail product was a line of jackets emblazoned with the insignias of Major League Baseball teams. Soon the company expanded its licensed apparel line to include headgear, activewear and accessories. By 1983, the company had entered licensing agreements with the NBA, the NFL, the NHL and the Canadian Football League (CFL). But the company's growth during this decade can also be attributed to an aggressive marketing strategy. Not only had the company made licensed sports apparel a fashion status symbol, it also created brand loyalty by making its \\"S and Star\\" logo a prominent part of the apparel's design. Starter innovatively placed its embroidered logo on jacket sleeves and on the back of baseball caps. Starter Miami Dolphins breakaway jacket Starter won a contract to create the parkas that coaches wore on NFL sidelines. For the retail market, Starter designed the \\"breakaway jacket\\", a pullover jacket that closely resembled the coach's parka.Look For The Star: How Starter Jackets Became The Iconic Clothing Of The Early ‚Äô90s by Jamie Cooper, 31 Jan 2017 Sales in 1989 were $58.9 million. By 1990, they had more than doubled to $124.6 million. In the early 1990s, Starter began to expand its distribution networks to reach over 25 countries in North America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. The baseball jackets gave way to a hooded design with a side zipper, and eventually to a padded half-zip pullover. Starter apparel also expanded beyond sports clubs into styles such as plaid. A famous ad campaign featured Hip-Hop stars such as DJ Jazzy Jeff. Within two years, Starter's net sales nearly doubled to $356 million. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 1993, earning an estimated $98 million. Proceeds from the initial public offering were used to expand sales to Europe and the Pacific Rim and also to launch \\"Brand Starter\\", the company's own sportswear line minus team logos. Capitalizing on the high recognizability of its name, Starter went head-to- head against brands such as Champion and Russell. Starter's competition in the licensed sports apparel business intensified in 1994 when Logo 7 Inc., the 2nd. licensed sports apparel manufacturer, won a much coveted NFL Pro Line license and beefed up its advertising budget in an attempt to knock Starter from its number one position. Overall, the boom in the licensed sports apparel market began to slacken in early 1994, slowing from an average of 38 percent annual growth to 15 percent annual growth. Starter moved into new markets with its licensed sports apparel, focusing on sales to young children and youth, and signed a new contract to manufacture the center ice jersey for the National Hockey League. The company purchased a retail chain, First Pick Stores, for $5 million of new stock in March 1994, and also established a Hong Kong office to better coordinate relations with manufacturers. Beckerman stepped down as president, although he retained the posts of chairman and chief executive. John Tucker, former president and chief executive of a sporting goods and sportswear concern, assumed the position of president. =Decline and restructuring= Although Starter began 1994 with a 23-percent increase over the first quarter 1993, it suffered a loss of $2.2 million in the second quarter. Second quarter 1994 sales were flat: $57.8 million, slightly lower than second quarter sales from 1992. Starter had predicted the loss, which it blamed on late deliveries from vendors, shipping delays to retailers, additional advertising and personnel costs, as well as start-up and contractor costs for a new Memphis distribution facility. 1997 saw Starter become one of three suppliers (along with Champion and then-rival Nike) of uniforms for the NBA, most notably the New York Knicks and Charlotte Hornets. When the original company declined financially, their accounts went to Puma. In 2000, when 29 other MLB teams switched to the MLB Authentic Collection, the New York Yankees were the last team to wear Starter jackets. The Starter name was purchased in 1999 by Official Starter Properties and Official Starter. These holding companies were in turn purchased by Nike on August 12, 2004 for about $43 million.COMPANY NEWS; NIKE BUYS OFFICIAL STARTER AND ENTERS DISCOUNT MARKET, The New York Times, 12 Aug 2004 =Recent years= Starter partnered with Walmart during the late 2000s/early 2010s.

Ashy geckos have been introduced to a few small islands in southernmost Florida, and have established populations there. There are eighteen species of Sphaerodactylus which can be put in seven morphological groups. There are two subspecies of S. elegans: * Sphaerodactylus elegans elegans Macleay, 1834 ‚Äî Cuba, introduced to small area of southernmost Florida * Sphaerodactylus elegans punctatissimus Dum√©ril and Bibron, 1836 ‚Äî Haiti and Dominican Republic S. elegans elegans is the subspecies native to Cuba including Isla de la Juventud, the archipelagos of Canarreos and Jardines de la Reina, and throughout the length of the Sabana-Camag√ºey Archipelago. In Florida The first observation of the species in Florida occurred in 1922 when it was introduced from somewhere in the West Indies excluding The Bahamas. Prior to 1930 species from the West Indies migrated to nearby islands through the means of cargo shipments. This mechanism is the most probable means of the immigration for S. elegens elegans to Monroe County, specifically the lower Florida Keys. The subspecies has not travelled far since 1922. Still found in the lower Keys, this species has had almost a century to migrate north but has been limited by geographic barriers. Although many of the lower Keys are connected by bridges used for vehicular traffic, and the Seven Mile Bridge connects Big Pine Key and Bahia Honda Key to Marathon Key, this is apparently not a viable route for this tiny, tropical species. S. elegans elegans is one of only twelve of over five hundred species of reptiles and amphibians from the West Indies to colonize south Florida. The proximity of the origin of the species is an important factor in its immigration to the lower Keys. S. elegans elegans is small. S. elegans elegans has granular scales. Its snout has a maximum length of 39 millimeters. Its colors range from a red tail to a blue tail, with a green midsection, and always with thin horizontal bands of black across its body. Its limbs are a variously colored and seem almost opaque in comparison to the rest of the body. There are no color differences between male and females in this subspecies. The other subspecies, S. elegans punctatissimus, is more muted and earthy in tone, overall less vibrant, with more of a spotted pattern.

Geithner\\", Bloomberg L.P.; 2018. Retrieved 12-07-18. As President of the New York Fed and Secretary of the Treasury, Geithner had a key role in government efforts to recover from the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 and the Great Recession. At the New York Fed, Geithner helped manage crises involving Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and the American International Group; as Treasury Secretary, he oversaw allocation of $350 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, enacted during the previous administration in response to the subprime mortgage crisis. Geithner also managed the administration's efforts to restructure regulation of the nation's financial system; attempts to spur recovery of the mortgage market and the automobile industry; demands for protectionism; tax reform; and negotiations with foreign governments on global finance issues. Family and education Geithner was born in Manhattan, New York, to Peter Franz Geithner and Deborah Moore. His father, a German American, was the director of the Ford Foundation's Asia program in New York during the 1990s, after working for the United States Agency for International Development in Zambia and Zimbabwe. During the early 1980s, Geithner's father oversaw the Ford Foundation's microfinance programs in Indonesia being developed by Ann Dunham Soetoro, Barack Obama's mother, and they met at least once in Jakarta. Geithner's paternal grandfather, Paul Herman Geithner (1902-1972), immigrated with his parents to the United States in 1908 from Zeulenroda, Germany. Geithner's mother, a Mayflower descendant, belongs to a New England family. Her father, Charles Frederick Moore, Jr., served as vice- president of public relations for the Ford Motor Company from 1952 to 1964, and advised President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as Nelson Rockefeller and George W. Romney, on their respective presidential campaigns. His uncle, Jonathan Moore, served in the departments of Defense, Justice and State, as well as in the United Nations. Geithner spent most of his childhood living abroad, including in Zimbabwe; Zambia; India; and Thailand, where he completed high school at the International School Bangkok. He studied Mandarin at Peking University in 1981, and at Beijing Normal University in 1982.Speech by Secretary Geithner 24 October 2014 Like his father, paternal grandfather and uncle; Geithner attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1983, with an A.B. in government and Asian studies, then earned a M.A. in international economics and East Asian studies from Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, in 1985. He has also studied Japanese. Geithner married Carole Marie Sonnenfeld, his classmate at Dartmouth, on June 8, 1985, at his parents' summer home in Orleans, Massachusetts. She is a licensed clinical social worker and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of Medicine, where she teaches listening skills to medical students. She is the author of a coming-of-age children's novel about grief. Her father, Albert Sonnenfeld, was a professor of French and Comparative Literature at Princeton University and a food critic; her mother, Portia, died when Carole was 25, shortly after she was married.Romero, Frances, \\"Obama's White House ‚Äì Treasury Secretary: Timothy Geithner\\", Time Specials, December 2, 2008 Pranab Mukherjee, then India's finance minister, with Geithner in 2010 Early career Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates in Washington, D.C., from 1985 to 1988, when he joined the International Affairs division of the U.S. Treasury Department. He served as an attach√© at the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo, then as deputy assistant secretary for international monetary and financial policy (1995-1996), senior deputy assistant secretary for international affairs (1996‚Äì1997), and assistant secretary for international affairs (1997-1998). He was Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs (1998-2001) under Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, who are widely considered to have been his mentors. While at the Treasury Department, he helped manage financial crises in Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand. Treasury Secretary designee Geithner meets then-Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus on November 25, 2008 In 2001, Geithner left the Treasury to join the Council on Foreign Relations as a Senior Fellow in the International Economics department. He was director of the Policy Development and Review Department at the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2003. Federal Reserve Bank of New York In October 2003, Geithner was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As president of the New York Fed, he served as Vice Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee. In 2006, he became a member of the Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty. In 2005, Geithner expressed concern over Wall Street trading in financial derivatives, which would ultimately contribute to the spread of the late 2000s financial crisis, though he did not pursue major reforms. In 2004, Geithner called on banks to \\"build a sufficient cushion against adversity\\", though in May 2007, he expressed support for the Basel II accord, which critics, including Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chairperson Sheila Bair, argued would reduce the amount of capital banks would be required to hold to guard against losses. That month, in a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Geithner stated, \\"Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk,\\" but also cautioned that \\"financial innovation and global financial integration do not offer the prospect of eliminating the risk of asset price and credit cycles, of manias and panics, or of shocks that could have systemic consequences.\\" As president of the New York Fed, Geithner was a central figure in the U.S. government's response to the late 2000s financial crisis. In mid- March 2008, together with then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Geithner arranged the rescue and fire sale of Bear Stearns, which was at risk of bankruptcy, to JPMorgan Chase for $2 per share (later raised to $10 per share). The Fed agreed to provide financing for the deal and support up to $30 billion of Bear Stearns's \\"less-liquid assets\\", despite some internal protests. In doing so, the New York Fed allowed Bear Stearns itself to calculate the value of assets acquired by the government and exposed itself to losses should those assets have declined in value, though JPMorgan agreed to absorb the first $1 billion in losses. The New York Fed stored these assets in the Maiden Lane limited liability company and awarded no-bid contracts to the Wall Street asset manager BlackRock for management of the assets, with the intent of ridding itself of the assets within 10 years. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, countering concerns that the rescue would invite moral hazard problems, Geithner argued that \\"a sudden, disorderly failure of Bear would have brought with it unpredictable but severe consequences for the functioning of the broader financial system and the broader economy.\\" Under questioning from Senator Chris Dodd, Geithner denied involvement in setting the share price of JPMorgan's purchase of Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns and JPMorgan chief executives Alan Schwartz and Jamie Dimon testified that Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke were aware of the amount being discussed and encouraged negotiators to keep the price low to avoid rewarding investors. In the late summer of 2008, troubles at the financial services firm Lehman Brothers were accelerating. In late August, the company announced that 1,500 employees (6% of its workforce) would be laid off, following 6,000 layoffs since June 2007. On September 9, Lehman's share price plunged 45% on fears that the company was facing billions of dollars in losses, and on news that a potential investment in the company by Korea Development Bank had fallen through. Three days later, Geithner convened a meeting of Wall Street executives, Secretary Paulson, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox to review exposure to Lehman's fortunes and discuss a possible liquidation of Lehman. Geithner indicated that the government would not save Lehman and urged the executives to cooperate on an industry solution, warning that the crisis could spread to their own firms should a deal not be reached. Government officials believed Lehman's collapse would be less dangerous than that of Bear Stearns, though Geithner sought to avoid that contingency nonetheless, citing the increase in market fragility by the time of Lehman's crisis. Nevertheless, no industry rescue materialized. Bank of America, which had been in talks to purchase Lehman, pulled out after the government indicated it would not take on Lehman's risky real-estate assets, as it had with Bear Stearns. On September 15, Lehman announced that it would file for bankruptcy, making it the largest investment bank failure since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990. Geithner, Paulson, and Bernanke later argued that Lehman's financial situation was too dire for the government to have legally rescued it. A team from Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse had estimated prior to Lehman's bankruptcy filing that Lehman's liabilities exceeded its assets by tens of billions of dollars (i.e., a negative net worth). Geithner was instrumental in government dealings with the American International Group (AIG) insurance company. Over the summer of 2008, as credit rating agencies downgraded mortgage-backed securities, AIG faced mounting demands to provide increased collateral to buyers of its credit default swaps. Consequently, by the time of Lehman's failure in September, AIG was facing a rapidly increasing multibillion-dollar capital shortfall. On September 13, AIG chief Robert B. Willumstad informed Geithner that the company would need to raise $40 billion and asked for government assistance in doing so. Geithner rejected the request for government funds and pressed AIG to find a private-sector solution to the company's liquidity crisis. On the morning of September, Geithner reiterated this decision at a meeting of Wall Street executives and requested that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan organize an industry-based solution. By that evening, private-sector appetite for an AIG rescue has dissipated. Later that night, a consensus emerged at the New York Fed that AIG, with $500 billion in troubled credit-swap obligations, could not be allowed to fail. At a meeting of the Federal Reserve in Washington the next day, Geithner and Paulson proposed lending $85 billion to AIG, with all of AIG's assets held as collateral, in exchange for a 79.9% equity stake in AIG and veto rights over dividend payments. Upon delivering this offer to AIG, Geithner informed Willumstad that there would be \\"no negotiation\\". As a result of Lehman Brothers's failure, money market funds with exposure to Lehman securities found themselves in distress on the day of Lehman's bankruptcy filing. One such fund was the Reserve Primary Fund. Due to the highly stable net asset value (NAV) of money market funds ($1.00 per share), money market funds were extensively relied on by companies for regular cash demands (e.g., payroll). Following Lehman's bankruptcy filing, due to a slowdown in credit markets, the Primary Fund was unable to sell once liquid assets to meet rapidly mounting demands for the redemption of investments. Geithner's New York Fed had been informed of the worsening situation at 7:50 that morning, and the next day rebuffed a request from the Primary Fund to assist it in making payments. Unable to sell Lehman's securities held by the fund, the board of the Primary Fund announced that it would freeze redemptions for seven days and reduce its NAV to $0.97 per share, meaning a money market fund would break the buck for only the second time in the industry's history. To stabilize the financial market, Geithner proposed that the traditional investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley transform themselves into bank holding companies to ensure continuing access to funding. Both banks completed the restructuring by September 21. Geithner believed, along with Paulson, that the Treasury needed new authority to respond to the financial crisis. Paulson described Geithner as a \\"very unusually talented young man...[who] understands government and understands markets\\". Secretary of the Treasury =Nomination and confirmation= Geithner was sworn in as Treasury Secretary on January 26, 2009 During the 2008 presidential campaign, Geithner was rumored to be a possible choice for Treasury Secretary for both John McCain and Barack Obama. On November 24, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Geithner to be Treasury Secretary, passing over Geithner's former superior Lawrence Summers. During his confirmation, it was disclosed that Geithner had not paid $35,000 in Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes from 2001 through 2004 while working for the International Monetary Fund. The IMF, as an international agency, did not withhold payroll taxes, but instead reimbursed the usual employer responsibility of these taxes to employees. Geithner received the reimbursements and paid the amounts received to the government, but had not paid the remaining half which would normally have been withheld from his pay. The issue, as well as other errors relating to past deductions and expenses, were noted during a 2006 audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Geithner subsequently paid the additional taxes owed. In a statement to the Senate Finance Committee, Geithner called the tax issues \\"careless\\", \\"avoidable\\", and \\"unintentional\\" errors. Geithner testified that he used the software TurboTax to prepare his 2001 and 2002 returns, but that the tax errors were his own responsibility.Tim Geithner- I Used TurboTax!\\", Congressional testimony, YouTube On January 26, 2009, the U.S. Senate confirmed Geithner's appointment by a vote of 60‚Äì34. Geithner was sworn in as Treasury Secretary by Vice President Joe Biden and witnessed by President Barack Obama. =Bailouts= Geithner had authority over the second tranche of $350 billion from the $700 billion banking bailout bill passed by Congress in October 2008. Under the Financial Stability Plan, he proposed to create a new investment fund to provide a market for the legacy loans and securities‚Äîthe so-called \\"toxic assets\\"‚Äîburdening the financial system, using a mix of taxpayer and private money. He also proposed expanding a lending program that would spend as much as $1 trillion to cover the decline in the issuance of securities backed by consumer loans. He further proposed to give banks new infusions of capital with which to lend. In exchange, banks would be required to cut the salaries and perks of executives and sharply limit dividends and corporate acquisitions.Brian Knowlton, \\"Geithner Is Pressed for Bailout Details,\\" New York Times February 11, 2009E. J. Dionne, \\"Centrism. Meh.\\" The New Republic February 12, 2009 The plan was criticized by Nobel laureates Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, a former World Bank Chief Economist. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac amounted a combined outflow of $620.3 billion in Treasury funds in the form of spending, investments, and loans. As of July 2016, $689 billion has been returned to the Treasury, primarily in the form of refunds provided by bailed- out companies and revenue from dividends. This has earned the government a profit of $68.6 billion.https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/ AIG bonuses Geithner and Obama aboard Air Force One, 2009 Although President Obama expressed strong support for Geithner, outrage over hundreds of millions of dollars in bonus payments (or employee \\"retention\\" payments) by the American International Group, which had received more than $170 billion in federal bailout aid, undermined public support in early 2009. In March 2009, AIG paid $165 million in bonuses to its financial products division, the unit responsible for the company's near collapse the year prior, following $55 million paid to the same division in December 2008 and $121 million in bonus payments to senior executives. In early November 2008, a joint committee of the Federal Reserve, Ernst & Young, and AIG concluded that the bonus payments, which were in contracts predating the government takeover, could not be legally stopped. During his time at the New York Fed and early in his tenure as Treasury Secretary, Geithner's aides had closely dealt with AIG on compensation issues, though Geithner indicated he was not aware of AIG's plans for bonus payments until March 10, 2009. On March 11, 2009, Geithner called Ed Liddy, the AIG chief, to protest the bonus payouts and request that the contracting containing the bonuses be renegotiated. Later in March, Liddy requested that employees who received bonuses of more than $100,000 return half of the payment. At Geithner's urging, Liddy cut $9.6 million in payments to company's top 50 executives in half and tied the remainder to performance. AIG payments to banks In November 2009, Neil Barofsky, the Treasury Department Inspector General responsible for oversight of TARP funds, issued a report critical of the use of $62.1 billion of government funds to redeem derivative contracts held by several large banks which AIG had insured against losses. The banks received face value for the contracts although their market value at the time was much lower. In the report, Barofsky said the payments \\"provided [the banks] with tens of billions of dollars they likely would have not otherwise received\\". Terms for use of the funds had been negotiated with the New York Federal Reserve Bank while Geithner was president. In January 2010, Rep. Darrell Issa released a series of e-mails between AIG and the New York Fed. In these e-mails, the Fed urged AIG not to disclose the full details of the payments publicly or in its SEC filings. Issa pushed for an investigation of the matter, and for records and e-mails from the Fed to be subpoenaed. Rep. Edolphus Towns, Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, issued subpoenas for the records and scheduled hearings for late January. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed would welcome a full review of its actions regarding the AIG payments.Liberto, Jennifer, \\" Bernanke: Bring on AIG scrutiny\\", CNNMoney.com, January 19, 2010Lawder, David and Felsenthal, Mark, \\"New emails show AIG mulled bank payment disclosures\\", Reuters, January 17, 2010Son, Hugh, \\"Geithner's Fed Told AIG to Limit Swaps Disclosure (Update3)\\",Bloomberg Press, January 7, 2010Son, Hugh, \\"Paulson Asked to Testify at AIG Bailout Hearing With Geithner\\", Bloomberg Business Week, January 16, 2010 Geithner and his predecessor, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, both appeared before the Committee on January 27. Geithner defended the bailout of AIG and the payments to the banks, while reiterating previous denials of any involvement in efforts to withhold details of the transactions. His testimony was met with skepticism and angry disagreement by House members of both parties.\\"Secretary Written Testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform\\" , United States Department of the Treasury Press Room, January 27, 2010Ng, Serena and Crittenden, Michael R., \\" Geithner Defends Big AIG Payouts\\", The Wall Street Journal, January 27, 2010\\"U.S. lawmakers turn up heat on Geithner over AIG\\", January 28, 2010DeCambre, Mark, \\"Geithner AIG grilling has bipartisan fervor\\", New York Post, January 28, 2010 Making Home Affordable In his book Bailout: How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street, Neil Barofsky argues that Geithner never had the intention to utilize the Home Affordable Modification Program as intended by Congress. Instead of providing relief for homeowners to avoid foreclosures, it was Geithner's plan that the bank should proceed with these foreclosures. Geithner said that he \\"estimates\\" that the banks \\"can handle ten million foreclosures, over time\\", and that HAMP \\"will help foam the runway for them\\" by ‚Äúkeeping the full flush of foreclosures from hitting the financial system all at the same time.\\" As such, \\"banks participating in the program have rejected four million borrowers‚Äô requests for help, or 72 percent of their applications, since the process began\\". Citimortgage and JPMorgan Chase were among the banks that refused the most HAMP claims. As such, the program only helped 887,001 people out of the over 4 Million people that were originally estimated to be able to benefit from the program. =China= Geithner with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the opening session of the first U.S.‚ÄìChina Strategic and Economic Dialogue on July 27, 2009 In written comments to the Senate Finance Committee during his confirmation hearings, Geithner stated that the new administration believed China was \\"manipulating\\" its currency and that the Obama administration would act \\"aggressively\\" using \\"all the diplomatic avenues\\" to change China's currency practices. The Obama administration would pressure China diplomatically to change this practice more strongly than the George W. Bush Administration had done. The United States maintained that China's actions hurt American businesses and contributed to the financial crisis. Shortly after assuming his role as Secretary of the Treasury, Geithner met in Washington with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. He told Yang that the U.S. attached great importance to its relations with China and that U.S.‚ÄìChina cooperation was essential in order for the world economy to fully recover. On June 1, 2009, during a question-and-answer session following a speech at Peking University, Geithner was asked by a student whether Chinese investments in U.S. Treasury debt were safe. His reply that they were \\"very safe\\" drew laughter from the audience. Geithner co-chaired the high-profile U.S.‚ÄìChina Strategic and Economic Dialogue from July 27 to 28 in 2009 in Washington, D.C. and led the Economic Track for the U.S. side. In September 2011, Geithner told a forum that China had \\"made possible systematic stealing of intellectual property of American companies and have not been very aggressive to put in place the basic protections for property rights that every serious economy needs over time\\", a rebuke of longstanding policy on the part of China to demand patents and other intellectual property from companies that sought to produce their products in China. He furthered that China was acting \\"very, very aggressive in a strategy they started several decades ago\\", which he defined as the ultimatum of transferring technology or being unable to produce products in China. =Opposing extension of tax cuts= In summer 2010, The New York Times said Geithner \\"is President Obama's point man in opposing the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy after their Dec. 31 expiration. ... [Geithner] has cited the projected $700 billion, 10-year cost of the tax cuts, and nonpartisan analyses that they do not stimulate the economy because the wealthy tend to save the additional money rather than spend it. 'I believe there is no credible argument to be made that the purpose of government is to borrow from future generations of Americans to finance an extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent,' [he] said in a recent speech.\\"Calmes, Jackie (August 19, 2010). \\"At Treasury, Geithner Struggles to Escape a Past He Never Had\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 2010-08-20. =Fiscal cliff and debt limit negotiations= Geithner was Obama's lead negotiator about the fiscal cliff and the increase in the 2013 debt limit. For example, on December 5, 2012, Geithner confirmed leaks from the White House, Treasury Secretary Geithner told CNBC that the Obama Administration is \\"absolutely\\" willing to go over the fiscal cliff if Republicans refused to back off from their opposition to raising rates on wealthier Americans. =Criticism= Geithner weathered criticism early in the Obama presidency, when Congressman Connie Mack (R-FL) suggested he should resign over the AIG bonus scandal, and Alabama Senator Richard Shelby said that Geithner was \\"out of the loop\\". Democrats largely joined Obama in supporting Geithner, and there was no serious talk of him losing his job. In November 2009, Oregon Representative Peter DeFazio, speaking for himself and some fellow members of the Progressive Caucus, suggested that both Geithner and Lawrence Summers, the director of the National Economic Council, should be fired in order to curtail unemployment and signal a new direction for the Obama administration's fiscal policy. When Geithner appeared in front of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee that month, the ranking House Republican, Kevin Brady of Texas, said to the secretary, \\"Conservatives agree that, as point person, you've failed. Liberals are growing in that consensus as well. Poll after poll shows the public has lost confidence in this president's ability to handle the economy. For the sake of our jobs, will you step down from your post?\\" Geithner defended his record, suggesting Brady was misrepresenting the situation and overestimating popular disapproval of his job performance. In June 2011, The New Republic criticized Geithner from the left, arguing that he was and is overly concerned with the deficit at a time when, following the Great Recession, the government should be pursuing stimulus; and as a result, it is possible that the stimulus was smaller than it could have been. Post-Treasury career Geithner left the Obama administration on January 25, 2013, and joined the Council on Foreign Relations as a Distinguished Fellow. In March 2014, he became the president and managing director of Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm. In February 2016, it was announced that JPMorgan Chase would provide a line of credit to help Warburg Pincus executives invest in a new multibillion-dollar fund at the firm. In July 2018, The Washington Post revealed that Mariner Finance, a company owned by the private equity firm of which Geithner is President, engaged in predatory lending behavior; capturing the sentiments of many former employees of Mariner Finance interviewed by The Post, a former manager trainee at a Mariner Finance branch in Nashville characterized the company's business model as \\"a way of monetizing poor people\\". Geithner lectures at the Yale School of Management, and is co-chair of the board of directors of the International Rescue Committee. His memoir of his time as Secretary of Treasury, Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises, was published in May 2014, and was listed for five consecutive weeks on The New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller list upon its release.NYT \\"BOOKS - BEST SELLERS - Hardcover Nonfiction\\", The New York Times; June 1, 2014. Retrieved 18 March 2019. In April 2016, he was one of eight former Treasury secretaries who called on the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union ahead of the June 2016 membership referendum. Media Geithner was portrayed by Billy Crudup in the HBO film Too Big to Fail, and by Alex Jennings in the BBC TV movie The Last Days of Lehman Brothers.

In 2002, after a spell at Bella Vista and Chilean side Everton, he joined Pumas at age 28. He played two seasons for Pumas and participated in the Copa Libertadores but did not become a regular member of the squad. Instead, he dropped down to play in the Primera A with Dorados de Sinaloa where he played 34 games scoring 10 goals. He was then transferred to another Primera A team, Lagartos de Tabasco where he played in 85 games scoring 46 goals. In 2006 moved to Puebla FC, who did not manage promotion after being relegated in 2005 to the Primera A. At Puebla, 'Bolita' quickly became a fan favorite as he helped the club win the 2006-07 championship. By doing so, he was top scorer of the Primera A two times where he scored 19 goals in the Apertura and then 22 goals in the Clausura. Gonz√°lez was fundamental in Puebla's promotion to the Primera Divisi√≥n in 2007. In 2009, he was released by Puebla FC and signed with Primera A's club and city rival Lobos de la BUAP where he scored 9 goals in 19 matches, and returning to Puebla FC shortly afterwards.

The history of the structure is shrouded in mystery since no official record of it exists. It is believed to have been pre-built in the 1890s in France and was destined to be placed in Madagascar via boat. Instead, the building ended-up in Angola's Skeleton Coast after the ship carrying it was drifted by the notorious Benguela currents. Portuguese rulers of the colony then claimed the ship along with all its contents, including the palace. During the Portuguese era, the building had a great deal of prestige and it was used as an art center. But after the independence of Angola, the palace was left in neglect with its surrounding area eventually ending up as a parking lot. It was also heavily damaged during the Angolan Civil War leaving some of its structures in a rusted and rotting condition. (Spanish)(Portuguese) Currently, the building is undergoing a renovation funded by profits from Angola's oil boom with the help of Brazilian construction companies, as many of the reclaimed iron balustrades and floor tiles were individually renovated in Rio de Janeiro. It now stands as the symbol of the city's rebirth as well as a point of social reference for the future. The Ministry of Culture of Angola is still deciding whether the building is to become a diamond museum or a restaurant.

The state had an area of , and a population of 63,702 in 1901. The state, which was watered by the Tons River, consists mainly of alluvial soil covering sandstone, and is fertile except in the hilly district of the south. A large area was under forest, the produce of which provided a small export trade. History The state was founded in 1778. From 1788 to 1790 Maihar State was occupied by Banda. The state became a princely state of British India in the early 19th century, and was administered as part of Bundelkhand Agency in the Central India Agency. In 1871 the eastern states of Bundelkhand Agency, including Maihar, were separated to form the new Bagelkhand Agency in Central India. In 1933 Maihar, along with ten other states in western Bagelkhand, were transferred back to the Bundelkhand Agency. The state suffered severely from famine in 1896‚Äì1897. Maihar became a station on the East Indian Railway (now the West Central Railway) line between Satna and Jabalpur, north of Jabalpur. Extensive ruins of shrines and other buildings surround the town. As of 1940 it had a population of 79,558 and an area of 412 square miles. In 1948 Maihar was merged into India.

Phytoplasmas are obligate cell wall-less bacterial pathogens (class Mollicutes), and rely on plants and homopterous phloem-sucking insects for biological dispersal. In plants, they are mainly restricted to the phloem tissue where they can move and multiply through the sieve tube elements. Hogenhout SA, Oshima K, Ammar el-D, Kakizawa S, Kingdom HN, Namba S. Phytoplasmas: bacteria that manipulate plants and insects. Mol Plant Pathol. 2008; 4:403‚Äì23. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1364- 3703.2008.00472.x. Almost identical symptoms of the GY syndrome are caused by different phytoplasmas and appear on leaves, shoots and clusters of grapevine. Typical symptoms include discoloration and necrosis of leaf veins and leaf blades, downward curling of leaves, lack or incomplete lignification of shoots, stunting and necrosis of shoots, abortion of inflorescences and shrivelling of berries. Those symptoms are related to callose deposition at the sieve plates and subsequent degeneration of the phloem. Although no resistant cultivars of Vitis vinifera or rootstocks are known so far, the various grape varieties differ considerably as far as symptom severity is concerned. It ranges from fast decline and death in highly susceptible cultivars to tolerant rootstocks as symptomless carriers of the pathogen. Currently, the only available control strategies include early eradication of infected crops, early eradication of infected source plants (weed control), and chemical control of vectors through regular insecticide treatments.GRAPEVINE YELLOWS - CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS AND UNSOLVED QUESTIONS, M.

It was developed jointly by Icom Incorporated and Kenwood Corporation. It is an advanced digital system using FSK modulation that supports encrypted transmission and data as well as voice transmission. Like other land mobile systems, NXDN systems use the VHF and UHF frequency bands. NXDN is implemented by Icom in their IDAS system http://www.icom.co.jp/world/idas/index.html and by Kenwood as NEXEDGE;http://www.kenwoodcommunications.co.uk/about-nxdn/ both Kenwood and Icom now offer dual-standard equipment which supports the European dPMR standard.http://www.icom.co.jp/world/idas/dpmr/http://www.kenwoodcommunications.co.uk/nexedge- dpmr/ NEXEDGE NXDN Hand Portable History Icom and Kenwood began their collaboration in 2003. The NXDN protocol was announced in 2005, and NXDN- compatible products first appeared in 2006. The NXDN Common Air Interface (CAI) was accepted at the Study Group 5 (SG5) meeting of the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R) held in November 2016 and in report M.2014-3 published in February 2017 as an international digital land mobile system.  Applications  The NXDN protocol and the communications products in which it is used are intended for commercial Private Land Mobile Radio (PLMR) http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=service_home&id;=private_land_radio and public safety communications systems. The technology satisfies the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate requiring all communications systems covered by Part 90 regulations to use narrowband technology by January 1, 2013. Part 90 regulations specify a bandwidth of 12.5 kHz, but the FCC ‚Äústrongly urges licensees to consider migrating directly to 6.25 kHz technology rather than first adopting 12.5 kHz technology and later migrating to 6.25 kHz technology.‚Äù The FCC ‚Äúwill expeditiously establish a schedule for transition to 6.25 kHz narrowband technology.‚Äù http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-04-292A1.pdf  Technical characteristics  NXDN uses Frequency-Division, Multiple-Access (FDMA) technology in which different communication streams are separated by frequency and run concurrently. Time-Division, Multiple-Access (TDMA) systems combine the communications streams into a single stream in which information from the different streams is transmitted in interleaved time allocations or \\"slots.\\" Code-Division, Multiple-Access (CDMA) systems allow many users to share a common spectrum allocation by using spread-spectrum techniques. The basic NXDN channel is digital and can be either 12.5 kHz or 6.25 kHz wide. 6.25 kHz dual-channel systems can be configured to fit within a 12.5 kHz channel. This effectively doubles the spectrum efficiency compared to an analog FM system occupying a 12.5 kHz channel. The architecture of NXDN is such that two NXDN channels, within a 12.5 kHz channel for example, can be allocated as voice/voice, voice/data, or data/data. As of 2012, this capability cannot be implemented in commercially available hardware on simplex or \\"talkaround\\" frequencies, but only through repeaters. Systems that use NXDN also support mixed analog FM and digital NXDN equipment, including direct radio-to-radio communications. This allows system owners to migrate to a narrowband, digital system without replacing the entire system at once. NXDN equipment is currently FCC type-accepted for use on VHF (137-174 MHz) and UHF (406-512 MHz) bands. Data is transmitted using 4-level frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation. NXDN uses the AMBE+2 vocoder (codec) for digital audio.http://www.dvsinc.com/press/PR20012.htm This combination provides better weak-signal voice quality than for analog FM. For an equivalent transmitter power, NXDN is represented as having a wider range and slightly better multi- path characteristics than analog FM in typical RF environments, specifically at the 12 dB SINAD threshold. The transmission bit rate is 4,800 bit/s. The following FCC emission designators apply to NXDN transmissions:http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Emission_Designator *8K30F1E 12.5 kHz single channel digital voice *8K30F1D 12.5 kHz single channel digital data *8K30F1W 12.5 kHz single channel digital voice and data *4K00F1E 6.25 kHz single channel digital voice *4K00F1D 6.25 kHz single channel digital data *4K00F1W 6.25 kHz single channel digital voice and data *4K00F2D 6.25 kHz single channel analog CW ID  Application functions  The NXDN protocol provides support for the following functions.

This leads to artifacts and compromises of frequency response in reproduced speech. Encoders and other compression schemes that are highly optimized for speech are often unsuitable for non-speech audio, such as music or frequency-shift keyed data. Using an inappropriate encoder usually results in the creation of distortion and artifacts in the reproduced audio. The audio reproduction quality of IDAS and NEXEDGE communications systems is dependent on the performance of the AMBE+2 voice codec used by NXDN. The AMBE family of vocoders has been subjected to comparative testing and found to be adequate for its intended uses, primarily mobile and aeronautical radio. The AMBE+2 vocoder has also been selected for use in the Motorola MOTOTRBO radio family as well as Hytera's DMR systems, and the Project 25 (P25) mobile radio system. The following reports and papers are descriptions of laboratory-environment evaluations of AMBE+2 and other speech vocoders. Compromises in audio quality are inherent in the use of any codebook-based speech coder, particularly when used in conditions of high background noise. Incremental improvements are being made in the algorithms, which may lead to differences in performance even while the basic method remains unchanged. In the US, the Department of Commerce Public Safety Communications Research laboratory regularly reports on progress in this field. While their work specifically pertains to Project 25 radios, it is directly applicable to any system using similar multi-band excitation coders.

While in command of Phoebe, Hillyar was present at the Invasion of Ile de France in 1810, was heavily engaged at the Battle of Tamatave in 1811 and captured the USS Essex off Valpara√≠so in Chile in 1814. In addition, Hillyar was engaged in numerous other operations, his first battle occurring in 1781 off Boston. He remained in the Navy until his death in 1843, and was active at sea during the 1830s, commanding fleets in the North Sea and off Portugal. He was knighted twice and two of his sons later became full admirals, Charles Farrell Hillyar and Henry Shank Hillyar. His eldest daughter Mary Ann married January 1843 in Malta Sir Cecil Bisshopp, Bt of Parham in the County of Sussex. Life Hillyar was born in 1769, son of naval surgeon James Hillyar, at Portsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire. He entered the Navy at just ten years old, serving aboard the frigate HMS Chatham during the American War of Independence. Chatham was employed on the blockade of Boston during the war, and 1781 fought a fierce action against the French frigate Magicienne, capturing the French ship, which was commissioned into the Royal Navy. Chatham was decommissioned in 1783 at the end of the war but Hillyar remained in service, principally on the North American Station, for the next ten years.Hillyar, Sir James, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 23 January 2009 In 1793, at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Hillyar was attached to HMS Britannia, the flagship of Lord Hotham in the Mediterranean. The following year he moved to Lord Hood's flagship HMS Victory and participated in the Siege of Toulon and the capture of Corsica, for which services he was promoted to lieutenant aboard HMS Aquilon under Captain Robert Stopford with the Channel Fleet. In Aquilon he was present at the Glorious First of June and subsequently moved with Stopford into the frigate HMS Phaeton, in which he remained until 1799, participating in Cornwallis' Retreat in 1794. In 1800, Stopford moved to the ship of the line HMS Excellent and Hillyar moved with him again, later taking command of the armed storeship HMS Niger. In Niger he attacked Spanish shipping off Barcelona and later operated as part of a boat squadron in Egypt during the British invasion of 1801 culminating in the siege of Cairo and the siege of Alexandria In 1803, after the Peace of Amiens, Hillyar served in the Mediterranean in Niger, refusing herelovian promotion as it may have left him in reserve on half-pay, which would have left his family destitute. Horatio Nelson discovered this and especially recommended Hillyar for service to Lord St Vincent at the Admiralty. As a result, Hillyar was promoted and permitted to retain Niger, with increased armament, in the Mediterranean. In 1805 he married Mary Taylor, daughter of a Maltese naval storekeeper. In 1807 he joined the fleet preparing for operations in the Baltic Sea and in 1809 commanded the 98-gun HMS St George as flag captain for Eliab Harvey. The same year he was given another frigate for independent service, HMS Phoebe. Hillyar commanded Phoebe in the Indian Ocean and East Indies during 1810 and 1811, and was present at the Invasion of Ile de France and the subsequent invasion of Java. On 20 May 1811, he was one of the captains engaged at the Battle of Tamatave, when a French frigate squadron was defeated and two ships captured. In 1813, Hillyar was appointed Commodore of the British Pacific Squadron and was ordered to operate in the Pacific Ocean against the American whaling fleets and fur trading posts. Off Chile, he discovered the American frigate USS Essex raiding British merchant ships and tracked her to the harbour of Valpara√≠so. Trapping Essex in the harbour, Hillyar waited six weeks for Essex to come out, thwarting all of the efforts of the American captain, David Porter to escape him. Eventually, on 28 March 1814, Porter attempted to break out of the harbour but was driven into a nearby bay and defeated in a short engagement. Hillyar brought Essex and her prizes back to Britain. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Hillyar remained in the navy, and in 1830 was part of Edward Codrington's squadron in HMS Revenge and in 1832 was commander of the British squadron observing the French Siege of Antwerp. He later moved to the first rate HMS Caledonia and served off Portugal. In 1837 he was promoted to rear-admiral. Hillyar had been knighted in 1834, as a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order. In 1840 he was also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, advancing from the Companionship of the Order of the Bath he had received in 1815. He died in 1843 at his home in Tor House, Torpoint, Cornwall and was buried in Anthony churchyard. He was survived by his three sons, two of whom, Charles Farrell Hillyar and Henry Shank Hillyar, later became admirals in Royal Navy.

It is an intestinal parasite of domestic cats and dogs. Severe infection is often fatal to these pets, especially in puppies and kittens. The infection is particularly endemic in the southern United States. It is most often confused with the zoonotic hookworm species Ancylostoma ceylanicum because of their uncanny resemblance. A. braziliense larvae can cause accidental infection in humans called cutaneous larval migration or creeping eruption, which produces severe itching in the skin. It is the most common skin infection in tropical region, particularly along the beaches of the Caribbean. Discovery and history When A. braziliense was described by Gomes de Faria in 1910, and A. ceylanicum by Arthur Looss in 1911, the two species were regarded as synonymous because of their apparent similarities in almost all respect. Especially in 1913, comparison of specimens from human, dog, cat and lion infections in India led to the conclusion that they were definitely of the same species. In 1915 Gomes de Faria realised that the two were distinct species based on their anatomical structures. Till 1921 the two hookworms were accepted as a two valid species. However, in 1922 Gordon made an exhaustive comparison from specimens collected in Brazil, South Africa and India, and his conclusion was that there were no significant distinction. Other parasitologists were also convinced of this so that the two names were again considered synonymous. In 1951 Biocca made an elaborate study on different hookworms in the collection of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and personal collections. He finally identified the defining characters between the two for classifying them as distinct species, which eventually gained general acceptance. Distribution A. braziliense is endemic in the southern United States. It is also found in a number of subtropical regions around the world, including Central and South America, South Africa, and southern Asia. In southern Asia, infection is confined to Indonesia, Borneo, and Malaysia.  Physical description  Like many other worms, the female worm is larger than the male. Also, the females are more difficult to distinguish because the teeth sizes appear very similar among the various species of Ancylostoma. Male worms, however, have two broad lateral lobes and a smaller dorsal lobe with rays on the copulatory bursa. These bursal rays' aids in distinguishing the different species of Ancylostoma. Life cycle Ancylostoma braziliense eggs are passed into the environment through the faeces of cats and dogs. The eggs incubate on warm, moist soil, where they hatch into larvae. The infective juvenile penetrate the skin of the host. At this stage, the larvae are present in the epidermis, hair follicles, and glands of the skin, sometimes extending to sebaceous glands where they form coils. Then they migrate to the heart and lung by moving along the blood circulation. In the lungs, the juveniles enter the alveoli and are propelled by cilia up the respiratory tract. From this, the host swallow them and deposit them in the small intestine. They get attached to the intestinal mucosa via the buccal capsule. Here they undergo two successive molts to become sexually mature individuals.  Etymology  Having an etymology will definitely help in remembering the parasite. Etymology: Ancylo = curved + stoma = mouth; braziliense for the geographical location where the worms were first found. Pathology It can cause \\"creeping eruption\\" or \\"ground itch\\". It occurs when the larvae from the faeces of cats and dogs accidentally penetrate the human skin, causing severe itching and skin eruption. It is the most common ailment of tropically acquired dermatitis, particularly along the beaches of the Caribbean. However, humans are not the natural definitive hosts, and are therefore a dead-end for the parasites. In humans, the larvae die after few months without further development.  Symptoms  Ancylostoma braziliense is a parasite that infects cats and dogs and occasionally humans. And, they survive by eating blood from the intestine of cats and dogs, causing anemia. Pale gums and weakness are common signs of anemia. The infected animals also experience significant weight loss, bloody diarrhea, and are not able to grow up to their right size. Other symptoms like, skin irritation and itching is also caused by the larvae burrowing into the skin. Diagnosis and treatment A. braziliense is difficult to differentiate from other hookworms. Microscopic examination of scatological samples can identify the eggs as they are generally smaller than those of other species. Most benzimidazoles are effective. Mebendazole, triclabendazole and fenbendazole are commonly used. Ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate are also effective. The combination of ivermectin 6 Œºg/kg and pyrantel pamoate at 5.0 mg/kg is 100% efficacious against adult worms in dogs. Human infection in case of cutaneous larva migrans is treated with oral thiabendazole at 500 mg in 4 daily dose.

Grant as the 18th President of the United States took place on March 4, 1869, at the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. This was the 21st inauguration and marked the commencement of the first four-year term of Ulysses S. Grant as President and the only term of Schuyler Colfax as Vice President. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase administered the presidential oath of office. Outgoing president Andrew Johnson did not attend the inaugural ceremonies, as President-elect Grant refused to sit with him in the carriage going to it. Instead, he was in the White House signing last-minute legislation. Grant's 1869 inaugural parade was grander than any of those before him. Eight full divisions of soldiers marched down Pennsylvania Avenue on that day. Windows overlooking the parade route sold for very high prices. This is also the first time ever that special tickets were required for admission to the Capitol on inauguration day. That evening, a ball was held in the Treasury Building. Grant's inaugural address There are three main points that President Grant put forward in his Inauguration Address, which he had entirely written on his own. Grant started off his Inauguration Address by discussing how the laws should be enforced and what an ideal executive branch should look like, > On all leading questions agitating the public mind I will always express my > views to Congress and urge them according to my judgment, and when I think > it advisable will exercise the constitutional privilege of interposing a > veto to defeat measures which I oppose; but all laws will be faithfully > executed, whether they meet my approval or not. > I shall on all subjects have a policy to recommend, but none to enforce > against the will of the people. Laws are to govern all alikethose opposed > as well as those who favor them. I know no method to secure the repeal of > bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution. Grant then went into the Civil War and reassured the American citizens that he would fight to retire the debt from the war. > A great debt has been contracted in securing to us and our posterity the > Union. The payment of this, principal and interest, as well as the return to > a specie basis as soon as it can be accomplished without material detriment > to the debtor class or to the country at large, must be provided for. To > protect the national honor, every dollar of Government indebtedness should > be paid in gold, unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract. Let > it be understood that no repudiator of one farthing of our public debt will > be trusted in public place, and it will go far toward strengthening a credit > which ought to be the best in the world, and will ultimately enable us to > replace the debt with bonds bearing less interest than we now pay. To this > should be added a faithful collection of the revenue, a strict > accountability to the Treasury for every dollar collected, and the greatest > practicable retrenchment in expenditure in every department of Government. Lastly, Grant fully endorsed the Fifteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1870, granting African Americans suffrage rights. > The question of suffrage is one which is likely to agitate the public so > long as a portion of the citizens of the nation are excluded from its > privileges in any State. It seems to me very desirable that this question > should be settled now, and I entertain the hope and express the desire that > it may be by the ratification of the fifteenth article of amendment to the > Constitution.\\"  Reactions to the inaugural address  Grant's inaugural address was well received by the American press and citizens. The address was recognized to be \\"brief, clear, emphatic, and to the purpose.\\" The American public gained faith in Grant's administration as they believed that Grant had a full sense of responsibilities, but without misunderstanding or fear of what was in front of him.  European congratulatory telegrams  When Grant reached his headquarters after the inauguration, the following table telegrams were placed in his hands.  Inauguration observances in other cities  Following are some inauguration observances published in other American cities, more can be found through the link in the footnotes. = Indianapolis, March 4 = \\"A prayer meeting, under the auspices of the Young Men's Christian Association, was held at Masonic Hall to-day from 12 to 1 o'clock, invoking Divine blessings on the incoming Administration, all Christian denominations uniting.\\" = San Francisco, March 4 = \\"A salute was fired and the public buildings and the principal streets of the city were decorated with flags to- day, in honor of the inauguration of GRANT.\\" = Nashville, March 4 = \\"Grant's Inaugural address was circulated here at 3:30 pm today.

The dam impounds the Ocoee No. 2 Reservoir and is one of four dams on the Toccoa/Ocoee River owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. It was completed in 1913. Ocoee Dam No. 2 utilizes a wooden flume that carries water from the reservoir down the side of the Ocoee Gorge to the dam's powerhouse downstream. It is situated at the center of one of the nation's top whitewater rafting locations, and the dam's releases help to maintain consistent rapids on the river during warmer months.Tennessee Valley Authority, Ocoee No. 2 Reservoir. Retrieved: 22 January 2009. Location Ocoee Dam No. 2 is located above the mouth of the Ocoee River, near the center of the Ocoee Gorge, a steep-sided valley sliced as the Ocoee winds its way westward through the Appalachian Mountains. Ocoee No. 2 is upstream from Ocoee Dam No. 1 and downstream from Ocoee Dam No. 3. The flume connecting Ocoee Dam No. 2 to its powerhouse winds its way along the cliffs overlooking the south side of the gorge before dropping the water to the powerhouse downstream from the dam. The dam and reservoir are surrounded by the Cherokee National Forest, and the only major road access is provided via the Ocoee Scenic Byway, a section of U.S. Route 64. Capacity Ocoee Dam No. 2 is a rock-filled crib- type dam high and long. The two units at the powerhouse downstream from the dam have a generating capacity of 23,100 kilowatts. The dam typically schedules major recreational releases on weekends in spring and fall and five days per week in summer months.Tennessee Valley Authority, Ocoee 2 Dam Recreational Releases Schedule. Retrieved: 22 January 2009. The dam's flume consists of a wooden trough situated upon a shelf carved out of the cliffside. The trough carries the water to a point just above the powerhouse where it drops the water through two large steel pipes to the powerhouse below. Without this flume system, the dam (at just 30 feet high) would be practically useless as a power plant. There is also a funicular railway at the powerhouse site that is used for transport from the powerhouse to the flume. History The growth of industry in Chattanooga some west of the Ocoee River in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th centuries required large amounts of electric power. Several private entities attempted to meet this demand by building dams that could produce hydroelectricity. In 1910, a group of financiers formed the Eastern Tennessee Power Company to use the Ocoee's hydro-power potential. ETPC completed Ocoee Dam No. 1 in late 1911, and work began on Ocoee Dam No. 2 the following year.James B. Jones, Jr., Towards an Understanding of the History and Material Culture of Pre-TVA Hydroelectric Development in Tennessee, 1900-1933. Retrieved: 22 January 2009. Train tracks carry service vehicles to maintain TVA's wide, deep flume. To build the dam, ETPC constructed a wooden \\"crib\\" made of by timbers, and filled the crib with stone. ETPC engineers realized that if the dam were built at the ideal powerhouse site, it would be unable to utilize the potential energy from the five-mile stretch immediately upstream in which the river drops in elevation. Engineers solved this dilemma by constructing the flume on the cliffs above the river gorge, which allows just a drop in the water level from the point at which it exits the reservoir to the point at which it spills through the pipes into the powerhouse below. At by , the flume was unusually large for its day.Tennessee Valley Authority, \\"The Little Dam That Could.\\" Retrieved: 22 January 2009.

Retrieved: 11 February 2013. The $78 million TVA paid for TEPCO included $2.59 million for Ocoee Dam No. 2. TVA made several improvements to the dam in the 1940s which increased the dam's generating capacity by 15%. The dam's basic diversion design was used by TVA in the construction of Ocoee Dam No. 3 several miles upstream in 1942. By 1976, Ocoee No. 2's flume had deteriorated, and TVA decided to shut it down. To prevent it from being dismantled, several preservationist groups had the dam and flume placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

The town quickly expanded during the late-eighteenth century as a centre of iron making, in part because it had a direct canal link to Glasgow. Cheap unskilled labour was in large demand and as result, the town became a very popular destination for vast numbers of people arriving in Scotland during this period. History of the Irish community in Coatbridge The Irish first began arriving in Coatbridge in the early-nineteenth century. During this period, there was great tension between the new immigrants and the native miners.A Century of the Scottish People, 1830-1950. T.C. Smout. Fontana Press (1997) The 1851 UK Census notes that the Irish-born population in Coatbridge made up a total of 35.8% of the population. However, it should be acknowledged that a significant proportion of these emigrants would have been Protestant. Sectarian strife was a feature of the nineteenth century Coatbridge. In 1857, there were reports of riots between local Catholics and Protestants.The Irish in Scotland - James Handley, 1962, Burns. p.255-6 The New York Times reported on serious \\"riots\\" between local Catholics and Orangemen which occurred during 1883.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/08/21/106252012.pdf According to James Handley,The Irish in Scotland, 1962 by 1901, the percentage of Irish-born in Coatbridge had fallen to around 15%, but remained the highest of all the major towns in Scotland. Handley's figures excluded the offspring of Irish-born immigrants and Handley argues that taking into consideration the culturally higher birth rates of Irish Catholic families at this time; the true figure of Irish population in Coatbridge at this time was in fact much greater. In the late-nineteenth century, the largest and most generous Irish Home Rule organisation in Britain was found in Coatbridge.Religion and Identity: The Irish World Wide: Volume 5 - Page 158 by Patrick O'Sullivan 1996The Irish in Britain: From The Earliest Times To the Fall and Death of Parnell - John Denvir, London, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., Ltd. P.417 Nineteenth century writers Andrew MillerCoatbridge Its Rise and Progress and the Coatbridge poet, Janet Hamilton both refer to the Irish in Coatbridge. Modern-day writer Des Dillon also writes at length about the descendants of the nineteenth-century Irish immigrants in present-day Coatbridge. The formation of Whifflet Shamrock in 1888 suggests an attempt to set up a team to represent the Coatbridge community.http://www.statto.com/football/teams/whifflet-shamrock The now defunct Patrick Sarsfield Hurling Club was set up in 1902The Gaelic Athletic Association and irishness in Scotland - JM Bradley, Mainstream 2007 p.43 with the √âire √ìg club conceived a few years later.The Gaelic Athletic Association and irishness in Scotland - JM Bradley, Mainstream 2007 p.58 √âire √ìg went on to win the league title in 1909.The Gaelic Athletic Association and Irishness in Scotland - JM Bradley, Mainstream 2007 p.61 Owen Roe O'Neill Gaelic Football Club was founded in the town in 1912.The Gaelic Athletic Association and Irishness in Scotland - JM Bradley, Mainstream 2007 p.64 In 1919, three branches of Sinn F√©in were in existence.The Gaelic Athletic Association and Irishness in Scotland - JM Bradley, Mainstream 2007 p.71 There was also a Gaelic League branch (Canon O'Keefe branch) in the town in 1901. At the 1950 general election, TP O'Callaghan stood as the candidate for the Irish Anti- Partition League. However, he finished in last place out of three candidates and was not elected. There is also quite a large Orange heritage in Coatbridge, with Men's and Women's Lodges and various flute bands including; Lily Of The Valley and Prince of Orange. General estimates that at least 60% of the population of Coatbridge have an Irish Catholic background are based upon census figures, factors such as high number of Catholic church parishes in the town (nine) and the fact that there are currently two Catholic secondary schools and one \\"non-denominational\\" school. Religious statistics gathered in the 2001 UK Census are not available on the census website due to 'risk' and the statistics being deemed 'sensitive data', but Catholicism was recorded at just over 50%. Current Irish immigration to Coatbridge The 2001 census recorded that currently less than 4% of the population of Coatbridge are Irish-born. Current culture and sport The Irish in Coatbridge have been a significant influence on the town's social, political and cultural life. In recent years there has been increased interest in the Irish cultural heritage of the town. Evidence of this can be seen in the St Patrick's 10-day-long festival (sponsored by the Irish government) and visits from members of the Irish government such as president Mary McAleese. On her last visit Mary McAleese described Coatbridge as the 'heart of Ireland in Scotland'. Currently there are four Irish dance schools in the area, regular Irish classes, a Gaelic football team (Sands MacSwiney, formed 1986) and an Irish Genealogy Project. St Patrick's Church is situated on the Main Street of Coatbridge and forms a hub of Irish activity in town hosting regular Irish quiz nights and shows of Irish themed films. In 2006, Coatbridge (along with Port Glasgow and Clydebank) was voted 'the least Scottish town in Scotland' due to having the highest percentage of Irish names in the country. Reportedly more than 28% of adults in Coatbridge had names with Irish origins. Ironically, Barra, the most Scottish place in Scotland is overwhelmingly Catholic compared to Coatbridge's slight majority.http://news.scotsman.com/scotlandspopulation/Island-takes-title-of- most.2809389.jp In 2008 Coatbridge was subject of an hour-long RT√â documentary regarding the Irish culture of the town.http://www.rte.ie/radio1/theirishexperience/1243060.html Perhaps the most obvious link with between Coatbridge and Ireland are the numerous Celtic F.C. supporters' clubs operating in the area. Phil Coles' Celtic supporters' club holds a legendary place in the folklore of Coatbridge Celtic supporters. Coatbridge is noted as a particular hotbed of Celtic support. A number of locals have also played professionally for the club including Gerry Creaney, Peter Grant, John McNamee and European cup medal winner, John 'Yogi' Hughes. =St. Patrick's Day festival= The Saint Patrick's Day Festival in Coatbridge commenced in 2003 with a single event and has run every year since. The festival has grown and, by 2007, it included an art exhibition, theatre, sports, music, film, street festival and dance events. The festival now runs for 10 days and each year the day-long Saturday street-party in Main Street with Irish music and Irish dancing is the festival highlight. In 2006, 9,000 people took part in the festival.St Patrick's Festival Coatbridge 2007 programme - minuteman press, 2007 p.2 St. Patrick's Day Festival Saturday in Coatbridge 2009. Guinness Diageo and the Irish government both sponsor the event. Irish President Mary McAleese visited Coatbridge in 2007. In 2006, Des Dillon's anti-sectarian play \\"Singin' I'm no a Billy he's a Tim\\" was performed at St Bartholomew's Church hall. Coatbridge accent In 'Celtic minded',Ed. Joseph M. Bradley, 2004 Des Dillon wrote about the notion of a separate Coatbridge accent influenced by the successive waves of Irish immigrants into the town. The Coatbridge accent has been categorised as generally less usage of the Scots tongue and the tendency to stress the 'a' vowel differently, e.g. stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) etc. and this is attributed to the impact of successive influxes of Irish immigrants, particularly from Ulster. Another notable language trait reminiscent of Hiberno-English that is practiced commonly in Coatbridge is the use of the 'reaffirmative' after a sentence, e.g. \\"I need to go up the street tomorrow so I do,\\" or \\"Tommy Tango's is always open so it is\\". This use of the re-affirmative is still common although, due to intermingling of the population, the Coatbridge accent is no longer so distinct from the neighbouring Glasgow accent. Notable people Notable residents representing the links between Ireland and Coatbridge have included Margaret Skinnider (1893‚Äì1971), a Coatbridge teacher who fought in the Irish 1916 Easter Rising, acting variously as scout and sniper before being wounded in action. She went on to become paymaster-general of the Irish Republican Army. Dr. Charles O'Neill from Coatbridge represented South Armagh as the member of parliament.The Gaelic Athletic Association and Irishness in Scotland - JM Bradley, Mainstream 2007 p.61 Eddie McAteer who was born in Coatbridge was perhaps the most important nationalist political figure in pre-troubles Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland Parliamentary Elections Results: Biographies Danny Hegan, born in Coatbridge, played international football for Northern Ireland.Danny Hegan, Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats.

Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase administered the presidential oath of office. This was one of the coldest inaugurations in U.S. history with 16 degrees Fahrenheit at noon, and the inaugural ball ended early when the food froze.

The room was designed for 6,000 guests, but only half that number attended. The president and cabinet arrived at 11:30 P.M. but stayed for a short time before moving on to a private, heated room for supper and by midnight the event was over. The inaugural series continued when a masquerade ball was held on March 5 in the ball building, although the president did not attend.The Masquerade Ball.

It is located on Territorial Road about southwest of Eugene; it is northwest of Cottage Grove. The community is near the headwaters of the North Fork Siuslaw River in a valley in the foothills of the Central Oregon Coast Range. Local businesses include several wineries, including the King Estate Winery, Chateau Lorane Winery and Iris Hill Winery, and two general stores. Lorane is also home to several notable late-19th-century/early-20th-century buildings, including the Lorane Christian Church, built in 1889, the Lorane Rebekah Lodge, built in 1898, and the Lorane Grange hall, built in 1909. Although Lorane is unincorporated, it has a post office; Lorane's ZIP code is 97451. Lorane is served by the Crow-Applegate-Lorane School District, including Lorane Elementary School, which was established in 1892 but closed in 2011. History Lorane was settled by white settlers who participated in the US expansion Westward to Oregon, encouraged by the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850, which gave 320 acres of free land to any unmarried white male citizen, or 640 acres to every married couple, who moved to the Oregon Territory before December 1, 1850. First settler contact in Lorane is thought to have occurred in the early 1850s, with significant colonial landmarks being the Applegate Trail, a stagecoach route, the Cartwright House (Mountain House Hotel), and the original landscape intended for the Southern Pacific Railroad. The Railroad was built in Cottage Grove, 12 miles east of Lorane. The indigenous keepers of the land that Lorane occupies are the Siuslaw people, who are believed to have arrived to the Oregon coast over 9,000 years ago. They spoke the Siuslaw language, but the last documented speakers of Siuslawan were the Barrett family and Billy Dick of Florence, who were interviewed in the 1950s. However, there are ongoing language revitalization efforts, knowledge of which is exclusive to tribal members. The white settler-colonizers of Lorane arrived after the Siuslaw people had been devastated by smallpox and ague fever (now believed to be akin to malaria) that arrived to the Oregon coast due to Spanish sailors in the 1770s, which was followed by further outbreaks in the 1830s. Researchers believe that the Siuslaw population was reduced to a few hundred from 3,000 in 30‚Äì40 years. The devastation introduced by settler- colonizers in the form of disease was coupled with massive wildfires and cultural genocide on the part of white settlers. On August 13, 1954, Dwight D. Eisenhower signed Public Law 588, which \\"terminated\\" the Siuslaw people, refusing them recognition and ending trust protection and services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1960, Siuslaw people were forcibly relocated to Yachats, at the Alsea subagency on the Yachats River. They were imprisoned here for 17 years and forced to farm the land. 50% of tribal members, which included the Siuslaw, Hanis Coos, Miluk Coos, and the Kiutsch, or Lower Umpqua, died from starvation, mistreatment, exhaustion, and disease. Not until October 17, 1984, when Ronald Reagan signed Public Law 98-481, was Tribal Sovereignty recognized, after a grueling battle on the part of the indigenous people. In 1987, what became the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians ratified a constitution and began to work rigorously on developing their community and political agency. Today, the Confederated Tribes run the Three Rivers Casino and Resort, and Blue Earth Services and Technology and provide services to five counties: Coos, Curry, Lincoln, Douglas, and Lane. Today, knowledge of the indigenous inhabitants of Lorane has all but disappeared in the community of Lorane. Documented interaction with the first settler-colonizers of Lorane and the Siuslaw people is exceptionally rare, summed up by the statement \\"there is a tradition of a Siuslaw village in the Lorane Valley, southwest of Eugene.\\" The land that Lorane rests on possesses a history that has been confined to the past due to the lack of Siuslaw people in the area of Lorane and the ease in which white settlers claim land as their own.

He was in the Royal Artillery during World War II, returning to New College in 1946. He took his finals in 1947, graduating with first-class honors in PPE. In 1947 he joined the civil service, working first in the economic section of the cabinet office, and then at HM Treasury. His colleagues included Robert Hall, Marcus Fleming, Nitta Watts, David Bensusan-Butt, Christopher Dow, Kit Jones, Fred Atkinson, Robert Neild, Peggy Hemming, and Bryan Hopkin and his close friends included Nicholas Kaldor and Tommy Balogh. Downie over the period 1952-54 was on secondment from his civil service job, in Geneva at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Following his return to the UK he took up a research grant at the Oxford Institute of Statistics, where he wrote work that made his name: The Competitive Process (1958). Downie returned to the treasury during 1956, where one of his achievements was to provide the theoretical basis of the treasury evidence to the Radcliffe Committee. As well, his involvement in macroeconomic policy advising took him, with Hall, into the long and disturbed development of proposals for prices and incomes policies. These were perhaps the first peacetime attempts to make policy specifically to loosen the inflationary and external imbalance constraints on economic growth created by relatively long periods of full employment. In 1961, Downie became the Assistant Secretary General in charge of Economics and Statistics at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris.

As a member of one of the five samurai families supported by the Tokugawa shogunate as hereditary official Dutch translators, K≈çsaku vetted imported documents (Christian materials were prohibited in Edo period Japan) and helped to keep the shogunate informed of global political matters. From roughly 1770 to 1800, he served as the chief mediator between the Dutch community on Dejima and the shogunate.Screech. p15. K≈çsaku was quite prolific in his writings, and has been described as \\"perhaps ... the most knowledgeable person [in Japan] about the West in his day.\\" He maintained a Dutch style home and Dutch-style medical school, which at times enrolled up to six hundred students. K≈çsaku wrote thirty-nine works, mostly on topics related to rangaku, and mentored a number of students, including Sugita Genpaku. K≈çsaku was critical at times, in his writing, of Japanese society, and in particular of the attitudes and manners of the citizens of Edo, the shogunal capital. In conjunction with a journey to Edo in 1774, accompanying officials of the Dutch East India Company, K≈çsaku wrote that Edo ought to serve as an example to the rest of the nation, and that the interests of the people of Edo were limited to the pursuit of profit. This document, included as part of a preface to the first integral translation of a European book to be published, was but one of many written by rangaku scholars at this time implying a need to rethink the Japanese attitude of Europeans as barbarians and of China as the only model for enlightened civilization.Screech. p32. Japanese scholars, officials, and artists visiting Nagasaki frequently made a point of visiting K≈çsaku; his lectures and Dutch- style home attracted great interest. Ranga painter Shiba K≈çkan visited K≈çsaku in 1788, stayed at K≈çsaku's home for a few nights, and was given a tour of Dejima. A portrait he painted on that occasion depicting K≈çsaku, partially in the style of Western oil paintings and partially in Japanese ukiyo-e style, survives today.

Before 1876, the English Sculling Championship was considered to be the premier event in professional sculling. In 1876, the English Title gained the World status and earlier winners were retrospectively given the title of World Champion. English Sculling Championship record Sadler, who lived in London and worked as a chimney- sweep, rowed his first great match in 1865, at the Thames Regatta Sculls. His opponent was T. Hoare, who was reputed the second greatest contemporary oarsman after English sculling champion Harry Kelley, of whom Sadler was a pupil. Sadler won easily, and the following year on 22 November 1866, contested the English Sculling Championship against Robert Chambers. Kelley, Sadler's mentor, had retired that year, leaving the championship title an open race between Sadler and Chambers. Halfway through the race Sadler seemed to have the measure of his opponent, but Chambers took the lead and did not relinquish it. In 1867 Kelley returned from retirement, and, on 6 May, sculled Chambers for the Championship on the River Tyne. Kelley won easily. The same year Sadler beat Kelley at the Paris International Regatta, but was disqualified for a foul. This created animosity between the two, which was to have a profound effect. =1867 court case= The next race between Kelley and Sadler took place on 28 November 1867, an English Championship decider at ¬£300 a side. Kelley came home first but a foul had occurred, and the referee was unable to decide which party was in the wrong. He accordingly ordered the two to row again the next day. The articles of the match provided for a start by 'mutual consent', and somehow Sadler did not consent at any moment when Kelley was ready. Strong opinions were expressed by several persons who watched the affair from the steamers, and eventually the referee ordered Kelley to row over the course. The stakes were awarded to Kelley by the referee, but Sadler brought an action against the stakeholder, M. J. Smith, then proprietor of The Sportsman newspaper. The case became a cause c√©l√®bre. The Court decided that the referee had acted ultra vires in awarding the stakes to Kelley, inasmuch as he had not first taken the trouble to observe for himself Sadler's manoeuvres at the starting post. He had formed his opinion from hearsay and separate statements. The case was decided in favour of Sadler, although history does not record that he also gained the title. =Later races= In November 1868, James Renforth beat Kelley to the Championship, but died in 1871 without having defended the title. During the period of Renforth's championship Sadler had successfully rowed in the United States during 1870; on Renforth's death he was deemed the best remaining sculler, but could not claim the title without a race. It was arranged that he row R. Bagnall, a Tyne rower, and the two raced on 16 April 1874 on the Championship Course. The distance was 4ml.300yds and the time was 24m.15s. Sadler won and was therefore World Champion. Sadler's next Championship race, on 15 November 1875, was against R.W. Boyd of Durham, to whom Sadler had previously lost by three- quarters of a length in a mile race on the Tyne. The championship race was held on the Putney to Mortlake course and the stake was ¬£200 a side. Boyd darted away and soon took a long lead but then faded. Sadler rowed steadily, overtook his opposition, and went on to win very comfortably in a time of 28m.05s. Sadler announced he would not return to training. This suggested that the race would have been Sadler's last. However, his actual final Championship race came on 27 June 1876, when he lost to Edward Trickett in 24m.35s. After an even start Trickett took a three lengths lead, which Sadler was unable to recover. This was the first Championship race rowed on sliding seats.(see Harry Clasper (section Sliding seats)). The race became known as the World Championship at this point as Trickett was the first non-British contestant to win. Sadler was reported to have retired after this race but he must have continued some later training. On 5 November 1877 he and Harry Kelley, his old foe, raced over the Putney to Mortlake course for a stake of ¬£400. After an even start Sadler went ahead and was never passed. His time was 24m.02s. After the race Kelley rowed over to Sadler and shook hands to the cheers of the onlookers. Crew races As well as his many single sculling races, Sadler was during 1865 and 1866 a member of the Sons of the Thames crew who won the Thames Champion Fours. In 1869, he competed in the same event for the Surbiton crew. Coaching Sadler coached the Kingston Rowing Club in the eights in 1880.

Christiansbrunn (Christian's Spring) is the name of two communities established in Pennsylvania.  Community beginnings  A community of Single Brothers was established by the Moravian Unity in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania in 1747. It was based on communal ideals developed by church leader Nicholas Ludwig Zinzendorf. The community was originally named Albrechtsbrunn, the Spring of Albrecht, an early brother. Water power was used to power a grist and saw mill which burned in 1749. Only the saw mill was rebuilt. The spring also supplied water to other industries including a milk house, distillery and brewery. Much of the community‚Äôs were also farmed and the surplus crops were used to support the Moravians‚Äô vast missionary effort. At its height the community had nearly three hundred cattle and six teams of oxen. An 1850s map showing the quadrangle of buildings around the public road.  Named for Moravian spiritual leader  The community was renamed Christiansbrunn and formally dedicated on August 4, 1749, in honor of Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf, head of the Single Brothers. He was then living at Herrnhaag in Germany but was expected to come live at the community. Several dozen men who left Herrnhaag due to scandalous events there later settled at Christiansbrunn. They continued the cult of the community's namesake much to the dismay of church leaders in Bethlehem and Christiansbrunn remained a source of embarrassment to the church due to its all-male population. The elder Zinzendorf was also expected to come to America to live and a manor house for him was constructed at the nearby Moravian community of Nazareth. That building, Nazareth Hall, still exists. Peach trees, Christian Renatus' favorite fruit, were planted so they would bear fruit by the time he arrived. However he died in 1752 in London. A belief among the brothers that Christian Renatus' spirit was in the spring itself was expressed in a poem of the time. Dennis Glew, ‚ÄúChristian Wedstedt‚Äôs Journey from London to Pennsylvania, June 13-September 14, 1753,‚Äù Unitas Fratrum, 10(1981), 86-96. Visitors to the site often commented on the tame trout that lived in the spring.  Center of trades and education  In 1757 sixteen boys from Bethlehem were sent to Christiansbrunn to learn trades that including farming, shoe making and writing (for maintaining community records). Silk making was also started, as well as rifle making. Christian Oerter, a noted American gun maker, made long rifles there and is buried in the Moravian Cemetery outside Nazareth. Hemp and flax were processed and woven. Music was also important, both singing and instrumental playing; the community had a trombone choir.  Community disbanded  In 1771, Christiansbrunn was the last Moravian community in the United States to have its communal economy disbanded. The community continued until officially disbanded by the church on April 1, 1796. The remaining farming operations were placed in the hands of family men while \\"several of the deteriorated bachelors were given a mere asylum there under watchful restraint\\" in the words of a late nineteenth-century historian who blamed conditions in the community on alcoholism and a \\"decadence that became hopeless.\\"Levering, Joseph Mortimer. (1903) A History of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 1741-1892. Bethlehem: Times Publishing Company. pp. 540. The remaining community buildings as they looked in the late 19th century The sacred spring was accessed through the cellar door in the brethren's house.  Later visits  A visitor in 1862 recalled how the community had looked forty years earlier: \\"The red-tiled roofs, the solid stone masonry of most of the buildings, and the peculiar structure of others, in which the frame is filled in with mortar mixed with cut straw, denoted at once the foreign origin of its founders.\\" The Moravian, October 30, 1862. Transcription in The Bethlehem Room, the Bethlehem (Pa) Public Library. The church sold the property in the 1840s when much of its once vast holdings in the Lehigh Valley were dispersed. The remaining buildings were photographed in the 1880s. A visitor in 1914 noted that only a stone house remained of the original settlement and that even the spring was covered by a recent shed. The Nazareth Item, November 6, 1914. Transcription in The Bethlehem Room, the Bethlehem (Pa) Public Library. As of January, 2009, those two structures remained. The stone building was the Familienhaus in which lived two married couples who oversaw the community of single brothers. As of 2009, the only remaining building was the stone Familien House to the left. The reorganized spiritual center of Christiansbrunn at its new located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.

Eighty-day crisis Vice President Arthur was cautious; he knew that there were a great number of people who thought that he had something to do with the attempted murder of the President, and didn't want anything to do with succession until it was actually necessary; in fact, he went into seclusion, largely confining himself to his house in New York City and avoiding public appearances.

The cabinet members wired President Arthur their advice that he should \\"take the oath of office as president of the United States without delay.\\" It was after midnight when Arthur and his guests dispatched messengers to locate a judge who could administer the presidential oath. The first jurist who could be located in the early morning hours of September 20 was John R. Brady, a Justice of the New York Supreme Court. At about 2 A.M.

Between 1826 and 1830, a turnpike road was constructed from Taunton to Bampton. This road later became the A361 (now the B3227), and is referred to by locals as the Wiveliscombe Road. Traffic levels on this road fell when the North Devon Link Road to Tiverton, from Junction 27 of the M5, was extended to Barnstaple in 1987, and was designated as the A361, with the old A361 being reclassified as the B3227. Historically, the village had a post office, garage, chapel, saw-mill, water-mill and pub. Today, all of these have been sold off to private owners, with the garage closing in 2011 and the site scheduled for development as four homes. The village pub, The Barleycorn, reopened under new owners as the Barleycorn House Bed and Breakfast in 2006 with five bedrooms. The Devon & Somerset Railway ran behind the village until its closure in 1966, with a link to the Exe Valley Railway running towards Tiverton and Exeter, branching off just beyond Morebath Junction Halt. Today, much of the track bed, along with bridges and other railway infrastructure, can be seen behind the village, and along the course of these lines. The village is sometimes confused with places of the same name, like Shillingford St George and Shillingford Abbot in South Devon and Shillingford, Oxfordshire.

Herrnhaag (Lord's Grove) was a communal spiritual centre for the Moravian Unity, an early form of Protestantism. It and Marienborn, a nearby sister community, are located in the Wetterau, an area of Hesse, north of Frankfurt am Main in Germany.  Spiritual purpose as the home of Christ  ‚ÄúHerrnhaag was designed to express the Moravian ideal before it was built‚Äù Freeman, Arthur.

There were to be twelve gates following the description of New Jerusalem in Revelation. In the center was the well of the water of life also recalling Revelation: ‚ÄúThen the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city‚Äù (Revelation 22:1). According to church leader Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf, who planned the community, the Moravian Unity anticipated ‚Äúthe end time when the heavenly reality would become the total reality.‚ÄùFreeman, 252. Living in that end time was the purpose of Herrnhaag, which was designed to be the residence of Christ. According to Zinzendorf, ‚ÄúWe have [the Holy Spirit‚Äôs] care to thank for the fact that we are brought here together, that we dwell in a Mother- city.‚ÄùAtwood, Craig D.

Formation and organization as a community living in Christ  Marienborn as it looked in the mid-18th century. During exile from the family estates in Saxony, Zinzendorf began negotiating for Marienborn as a residence for what was called the Pilgrim Congregation. Before it was available, he brought his family to stay at the Ronneburg, a dilapidated castle in the area. Eventually the Zinzendorfs moved into Marienborn and construction of Herrnhaag began in 1738. The community was unfinished at the time of its abandonment in the early 1750s. Community members lived under the direct rule of Christ as the community‚Äôs chief elder and shepherd. Herrnhaag was the church‚Äôs fastest growing settlement and the one most criticized for heresy. The community‚Äôs focal point was the great hall, the Saal, the place of ritual and worship. The Saal was built on two levels, with a balcony overlooking the main floor, representing earthly reality below and the heaven reality above. The festivals held in the Saal provided a multimedia effect on worshippers resulting from the combination of illuminations, music, ritual, paintings and pageantry. The Saal or hall, scene of festivals and religious ceremonies. The cantata written for the dedication of Herrnhaag‚Äôs Single Brethren‚Äôs House in 1739 shows how community residents looked upon their lives as dedicated to Christ ‚ÄúYou know how much we cherish you, most magnificent of all gifts! Precious offering of grace from above! Bless the sacred marriage. Bless the sacred virginity . . . the young men‚Äôs strength will be gathered for knighthood in your service . . . This house shall become, and those that live therein, your glorification here on earth!‚ÄùErbe, Hans-Walter. (1982) ‚ÄúDie Herrnhaag-Kantate von 1739,‚Äù 11, Unitas Fratrum: 11. pp. 29-34. Translation by Edward Quinter. As with other Moravian communities, living arrangements were based on the separation of members according to age, marital status and gender into so-called choirs. Each choir had its own festivals. The festival of the Single Brothers at Herrnhaag in 1748 included the glorification of Christ's sidehole wound, considered sacred because it represented Christ's compassionate, sacrificing love. Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf, Nicolaus Ludwig's son, led the ceremony making it clear that he literally had become the sidehole of Christ and when he embraced the men, they were embraced by the sidehole.Peucker, Paul. (2006) ‚ÄúInspired by Flames of Love‚Äù: Homosexuality, Mysticism and Moravian Brothers around 1750, Journal of the History of Sexuality. 15(1):48. There was also a pictorial representation of the sidehole large enough that each man could enter and pass through it. In this way the men understood they were becoming one with Christ.  Scandal, dispersal and abandonment  What was condemned as heretical by many towards events at Herrnhaag was the blending of the sexual and the spiritual, the human and the divine. Based on writings of Christian Zinzendorf proclaiming all souls to be female, the brothers were proclaimed by Christian Renatus to actually be female and therefore eligible to be brides of Christ who could be entered and filled. There is some evidence that they practiced this literally among themselves and perhaps between the genders as well, though one should be careful to make conclusions, as the times of Count Zinzendorf were immersed in slander and defamatory libels, of whose it is difficult to ascertain truth and false (a famous example is Voltaire's \\"Vie priv√©e du roi de Prusse\\"). Original sources should be a primary source. Of such, Count Zinzendorfs \\"Anhang, als ein zweiter Theil zu dem Gesang-Buche der Evangelischen Br√ºder-Gemeinen\\" (Addition, as a second part to the song-book of the evangelical brother- congregations), S.

In 1748, Alexander Volck, a lawyer and of public station in the nearby town of B√ºdingen, started to publish books (first anonymous, then under his own name)\\"Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Bosheit der Herrnhutischen Secte: Zu Errettung vieler unschuldigen Seelen\\" (The disclosed secret of the evil of the Herrnhutian sect, to the saving of many innocent souls) https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/resolve/display/bsb10775705.html about the promiscuities and also diverse about Count Z. himself, e.g. that he traveled with his mistress, Anna Nitschmann (1715 - 1760) in their own luxurious horse-carriage. The publication of these books caused great stir, and is probably a main reason why the Count suddenly in the same year moved to London, of a fear he might be arrested by the authorities in B√ºdingen. Many within and without the church were scandalized by rumors of such behavior and Ludwig von Zinzendorf finally decided to take action, threatening to whip those involved.Hergem√∂ller, Bernd-Ulrich.

Translated by Hilke Kuhlmann. Christian and others were called to Lindsey House outside London where Nicholas was living. The residents of Herrnhaag began dispersing after this. In addition to the bad publicity, Herrnhaag and its festivals were a financial drain on the church. But the decision to actually close the settlement was the result of the new local ruler, Gustav Friedrich Count of Ysenburg-B√ºdingen, who demanded that the Moravians abjure Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf and swear fealty only to himself.

California, 380 U.S. 609 (1965), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled, by a 6-2 vote, that it is a violation of a defendant's Fifth Amendment rights for the prosecutor to comment to the jury on the defendant's declining to testify, or for the judge to instruct the jury that such silence is evidence of guilt.. The ruling specified that this new extension to defendants' Fifth Amendment rights was binding on all States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This \\"no-comment rule\\" had already been binding on the federal government's courts because of an 1878 law. Background of the case Edward Dean Griffin was convicted of the murder of Essie Mae Hodson before a jury in a California court. Griffin had been invited into an apartment shared by Hodson and her boyfriend, Eddie Seay. After going to bed, Seay was awakened by noise; he saw Griffin and Hodson struggling, and Hodson said Griffin had tried to force her to have sex. After Seay locked Griffin outside the apartment, Griffin broke back into the apartment and struck Seay, who ran to a bar for help. Upon returning, Griffin and Hodson were gone. In the morning, a witness saw Griffin, buttoning up his pants, coming out of a very large trash box in an alley about 300 feet from Hodson's apartment. The witness found Hodson in the trash box, bleeding and apparently in shock. She died at a hospital the next day from her injuries. Griffin, who already had multiple felony convictions, did not testify at the trial. As the U.S. Supreme Court said in its ruling, the prosecutor in the final argument to the jury \\"made much of the failure of [Griffin] to testify\\": The judge, in his instructions to the jury, stated that a defendant has a constitutional right not to testify, and that this did not create a presumption of guilt, nor reduce the need for the prosecution to prove its case; but also stated to the jury: This jury instruction was valid under the California Constitution, whose \\"comment practice\\" clause in Article I stated at the time, \\"[I]n any criminal case, whether the defendant testifies or not, his failure to explain or to deny by his testimony any evidence or facts in the case against him may be commented upon by the court and by counsel, and may be considered by the court or the jury.\\" Griffin was convicted and sentenced to the death penalty. The California Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, and subsequently the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine \\"whether comment on the failure to testify violated the Self- Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment which we made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth in Malloy v. Hogan.\\" History and legal background Until the late 19th century, defendants in criminal trials in the United States were not allowed to testify. Starting in 1864, the States started to allow this practice, until by the end of the 20th century, Georgia was the only State that still prohibited testimony from the defendant.Griffin, Lissa, p. 934. A new concern was that although under the Fifth Amendment no defendant could be forced to testify, now that testifying was permitted, \\"the failure of a defendant to testify would be seen as a confession of guilt and that jurors would draw this inference regardless of any instructions they might receive.\\"Griffin, Lissa, p. 935. To help reduce the impact or the likelihood of this inference, the federal government passed a law in 1878 called the \\"no- comment rule\\", prohibiting prosecutors from commenting on the failure to testify, and prohibiting any presumption against the defendant based on his failure to testify. (This law is currently .) This federal law applied only to the federal courts, and because of the principle of federalism, the States made their own decisions on this matter. For example, the California Constitution explicitly permitted counsel and the judge to comment on the failure to testify. In two rulings before Griffin, Twining v. New Jersey (1908) and Adamson v. California (1947), the Supreme Court upheld state laws allowing such adverse comments, ruling that even if adverse comments did violate defendants' Fifth Amendment rights, the Fifth Amendment did not bind the States. In Malloy v. Hogan (1964), the Court reversed this stance, ruling that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extended Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination to State trials. The ruling Justice Douglas wrote for the Court that a prosecutor's or judge's comment to the jury about a defendant's refusal to testify \\"is a remnant of the 'inquisitorial system of criminal justice', which the Fifth Amendment outlaws. It is a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\\" The Court then noted that an objection to this logic might be that a jury might find it \\"natural and irresistible\\" to infer the guilt of a defendant who refused to testify while possessing facts about the evidence against him, and so a judge's commenting upon the refusal did not \\"magnify that inference into a penalty for asserting a constitutional privilege\\"; but went on to state that a judge's comment on the refusal \\"solemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him.\\" In a footnote, the Court noted that this ruling was \\"no innovation\\", because a majority of the Court had already written in Adamson v. California (1947) that California's \\"comment practice\\" violated the Fifth Amendment. At the time, however, the Court had not yet ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment made the Fifth Amendment applicable to the States. =Justice Harlan's concurrence= Justice Harlan concurred \\"with great reluctance\\", agreeing with the Court that \\"within the federal judicial system the Fifth Amendment bars adverse comment by federal prosecutors and judges on a defendant's failure to take the stand in a criminal trial\\", but writing that this \\"no-comment\\" rule was a \\"non-fundamental\\" part of the Fifth Amendment, and that he would only apply it to the States because of the previous term's Malloy v. Hogan decision. (Justice Harlan had dissented from the Malloy decision, writing that the \\"compelled uniformity\\" of applying the Fifth Amendment to the States \\"carries extremely mischievous, if not dangerous, consequences for our federal system\\".) Justice Harlan wrote that state and federal courts need not run by the same rules and that cases such as Griffin showed that the practical tendency had been for the federal judiciary to override the state judiciary, which was contrary to the basic idea of federalism; and that he hoped \\"that the Court will eventually return to constitutional paths which, until recently, it has followed throughout its history.\\" =The dissent= Justice Stewart, joined by Justice White, dissented, writing that the Fifth Amendment states that no person \\"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\\", and that California's \\"comment rule\\" did not \\"compel\\" the defendant nor anyone else to testify. Also, \\"the California procedure is not only designed to protect the defendant against unwarranted inferences which might be drawn by an uninformed jury; it is also an attempt by the State to recognize and articulate what it believes to be the natural probative force of certain facts.\\" Justice Stewart wrote that the formulation of such rules \\"is properly a matter of local concern\\", and noted that the American Bar Association and the American Law Institute had endorsed the \\"comment\\" practice. Significance and Criticism In Mitchell v. United States (1999), the Court extended Griffin's no-comment rule to the sentencing phase of State trials. Justice Scalia wrote in his dissent that Griffin \\"did not even pretend to be rooted in a historical understanding of the Fifth Amendment. Rather, in a breathtaking act of sorcery it simply transformed legislative policy into constitutional command,\\" and that \\"To my mind, Griffin was a wrong turn  which is not cause enough to overrule it, but is cause enough to resist its extension.\\" This dissent was joined by three other Justices, including Justice Thomas, who added in a separate dissent that Griffin \\"lacks foundation in the Constitution's text, history, or logic\\", and should be overruled outright. A 1980 article in the Michigan Law Review stated that Griffin occurred \\"at the peak of [the Supreme Court's] enthusiasm to expand the constitutional protections of criminal defendants\\", and that it has \\"impaired the effective operation of the criminal justice system\\", automatically reversing cases where the defendant's silence is mentioned but being a \\"complete failure to address the much more common situation in which no comment is made by judge or prosecutor but the jury nonetheless concludes that the defendant is guilty because he has nothing to offer in his own defense.\\" Great American Court Cases wrote that the Griffin ruling \\"preserved the presumption of innocence to which a defendant is constitutionally entitled.\\" The United Kingdom had a no-comment rule similar to that established in Griffin, but the rule was reversed in Northern Ireland in 1988 as a response to IRA terrorism, and then the reversal spread throughout the United Kingdom.Griffin, Lissa, p. 950. Using this reversal as an argument, a 2007 article in the William & Mary Bill of Rights Journal argued that \\"Griffin's no-comment rule has never faced a challenge as daunting as that posed by modern domestic terrorism\\", and that it is currently \\"vulnerable\\" to reversal.Griffin, Lissa, p. 961. Subsequent events in the case After the U.S. Supreme Court's reversal of Griffin's conviction, he was tried again for murder, and a mistrial was declared when the jury was deadlocked 2 to 10 in favor of a second-degree murder conviction. In his third trial, the jury found Griffin guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. Upon automatic appeal (because of the jury's recommendation of the death penalty), the court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction and imposition of the death penalty.People v.

His decision to invite Japanese companies to bid to become consortium members of a wide array of Russian rail infrastructure work, particularly the Sakhalin Tunnel (or bridge) to the Russian mainland could be taken as a nod towards future rail cooperation between Russia and Japan. The tunnel would span roughly 40‚Äì45 km between Sakhalin's Cape Crillon (in Russia) to Hokkaido's Cape S≈çya (in Japan). In comparison, the completed Seikan Tunnel links the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido. A further tunnel or bridge in the north of Sakhalin to the Russian mainland would also have to be created. Already a proposal for the Sakhalin Tunnel, has been announced by the Russian Government. Once on the Russian mainland, the rail link could connect to the rest of the Russian (and hence European) rail network, allowing for gauge changes. Running south, from Hokkaido, the line would connect with the Seikan Tunnel between Hokkaido and Honshu, currently the longest undersea tunnel in the world and second-longest railway tunnel. This would allow connections to the rest of the Japanese rail network. The project could be seen as an alternative to the Japan‚ÄìKorea Undersea Tunnel, as Russia is already under way with planning and construction of many of the necessary linkages on the Russian side, whilst the tunnel itself would be considerably shorter than that between Japan and Korea. As well as the great cost and engineering difficulty, there may be political problems, particularly in regards to the Kuril Islands dispute between Russia and Japan. The Japanese government's initial reaction has been positive towards the idea. Russian officials again raised the idea of a bridge or tunnel to connect Sakhalin with Hokkaido in 2013. When combined with a potential bridge between Sakhalin and the Russian mainland, if built, it would be one of the final fixed links needed for a continuous rail corridor between Europe and Japan. The project has repeatedly come up in discussions between officials from Russia and Japan. During Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs first term in office, the Kremlin greatly intensified its outreach to Japan, the world‚Äôs third biggest economy. Russia‚Äòs plan was to build a 28-mile bridge between the two countries that could link Moscow to Tokyo by land and rail. Putin reignited speculation about the long-rumored project in 2017, when he announced that a land link between Russia and Japan would have ‚Äúplanetary‚Äù significance. In July 2018, Russia‚Äôs president Vladimir Putin commissioned an analysis of a proposal to build a bridge to Sakhalin Island. Putin said that the project is very important for Sakhalin residents and would be a major factor in encouraging people to remain in the region. It would also boost the development of Khabarovsk Territory. He said that he has instructed the government to analyse this matter, particularly its economic aspects.  Gauges  The railways on the Russian mainland use the Russian gauge, while the Sakhalin Railway was by 2019 converted from the original Japanese gauge to the Russian gauge. Japanese railways use and standard gauge. It is unclear what rail gauge would be used for the proposed tunnel and associated infrastructure.

In 1932, a secondary department was added, which became a secondary modern school after reorganisation following the Education Act 1944. In 1956, the seniors moved to the newly established Winchmore School on the opposite side of Highfield Road. It was converted to a comprehensive school in 1967. In 2001, it was identified by Ofsted as achieving better results than other schools with its students who were of Black-Caribbean origin, who made up 13 per cent of the students at that time.  Buildings  The school is made up of three main buildings, two three-floor buildings and one two-floor building. After 1956, the school continued to make use of prefabricated building on the primary school site for many years. It was initially called Winchmore Secondary Modern and its headmaster was Mr Shepherd. Later the school changed its name to Winchmore School. The school also has four music rooms all of which have an electronic keyboard on each table.  Jackson family  Winchmore School is the only school in the world to have a long-standing relationship with the Jackson family. In September 2009 the Jackson family awarded year 12 Winchmore student Saul Nash the Michael Jackson Award for Outstanding Achievement in Expressive Arts. Saul was the first person in the world to win the award. Katherine Jackson, who spoke to Saul on the phone and congratulated him, has said that she and her daughter Janet Jackson would like to visit the school sometime in the future.

He was the son of Samuel Dahl (1847-1932) and Katarina Lovisa Peterson (1859-1931). In his youth, his family moved to the parish of Osby, in Sk√•ne where his father became rector of the local parish church. Both Dahl's father and grandfather had been Lutheran ministers of the Church of Sweden. His brother was the composer Viking Dahl (1895-1945). Dahl attended college at Kristianstad and Malm√∂. He immigrated to America from Sweden in 1902. He attended Augustana College and Seminary in Rock Island, Illinois. His home in Osby had been near that of Augustana College founder Tuve Hasselquist. Career Dahl was ordained into the ministry of the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church at New Britain, Connecticut during 1907. Dahl was initially assigned to Immanuel Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska where he then served as associate minister under Dr. Lindberg. He subsequently served rural parishes in Roberts County, South Dakota, including the Walla Lutheran Church in New Effington. Dahl also served the nearby Lake Traverse Indian Reservation.100 Years of Precious Memories (Walla Lutheran Church, New Effington, South Dakota, July 3, 1994) In 1912, Dahl wrote Hedens Barn, a book written in his native Swedish language. This book has a setting in rural Roberts County, South Dakota and tells of life among the early pioneer homesteaders. The book is a study of people struggling against the elements to make a new life on the prairie.Children of the Prairie (translated from the Swedish by Emeroy Johnson (1984) Minden: Fifth Street Printing ) Dahl moved on to Axtell, Nebraska in 1912 as the local Lutheran minister.

The two can be distinguished with a Chelsea color filter, as chrome chalcedony will appear red, whilst chrysoprase will appear green.

Chrome chalcedony is (together with agate, carnelian, chrysoprase, heliotrope, onyx and others) a variety of chalcedony. This is a cryptocrystalline form of silica, consisting of fine intergrowths of the minerals quartz and moganite.

The inauguration ‚Äì the fifth non-scheduled, extraordinary inauguration to ever take place and the first in the 20th century ‚Äì marked the commencement of the first term (a partial term of ) of Theodore Roosevelt as President. John R. Hazel, U.S. District Judge for the Western District of New York, administered the presidential oath of office. Background On September 6, Vice President Roosevelt had been at a luncheon of the Vermont Fish and Game League on Lake Champlain when he learned the news that McKinley had been shot. He rushed to Buffalo, but after being assured the president would recover, he went on a planned family camping and hiking trip to Mount Marcy in the Adirondacks. A week after the shooting, on the mountains, a runner notified him McKinley was on his death bed. Roosevelt pondered with his wife, Edith, how best to respond, not wanting to show up in Buffalo and wait on McKinley's death. Roosevelt was rushed by a series of stagecoaches to North Creek train station. At the station, Roosevelt was handed a telegram that said President McKinley died at 2:15 (September 14) that morning. The new president continued by train from North Creek to Buffalo. He arrived in Buffalo later that morning, accepting an invitation to stay at the home of Ansley Wilcox, a prominent lawyer and friend since the early 1880s when they had both worked closely with then-New York Governor Grover Cleveland on civil service reform. Ceremony Interior of room in Wilcox House where Theodore Roosevelt took the presidential oath of office. At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of September 14, several members of President McKinley's cabinet arrived at the Wilcox house (now known as the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site). They were United States Secretary of War Elihu Root, Secretary of the Navy John D. Long, Attorney General Philander C. Knox, Secretary of the Interior Ethan Hitchcock, Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith, and Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson. With them were Judge Hazel, Judge Albert Haight of the New York Court of Appeals, and United States Senator from New York Chauncey Depew, among others. Roosevelt met with them informally in the Library and, at the last moment, the newspaper men were all let in, but were prohibited from taking any photographs. Then, when asked whether he was ready to take the oath, he answered, \\"I will take the oath. And in this hour of deep and terrible national bereavement, I wish to state that it shall be my aim to continue, absolutely without variance, the policy of President McKinley, for the peace and honor of our beloved country.\\" After his response, Judge Hazel administered the oath.

Reverse of a 1905 Roosevelt presidential inaugural medal. Roosevelt had an optimistic tone to his second inaugural address. He speaks of past successes, but warns that any success in the future will only come with hard work. He commented on how any weak nation shall have nothing to fear from the US, but warns that America will not be the subject for insolent aggression. The President cited good relations with the world as being important, but relations among Americans as most important. He admitted that the Founding Fathers could not have foreseen certain problems that plagued the nation, but assures that these are problems that all great nations face. Roosevelt recognized that the industrial age made it difficult for Americans to adapt to the complexities of modern life, but assured Americans that the technological innovations brought tremendous change in everyday life. He spoke about the difficulty of self-government, and warns that should America fail, it would shake all free nations to their foundations. Roosevelt called this a heavy responsibility, to Americans, to the world, and to the unborn generations. He gave no reason to fear the future or unseen problems, but encourages the problems be met head-on. In his closing, Theodore Roosevelt clarified that the problems facing Americans differs from those of the Founding Fathers, but insisted that these problems be met with the same spirit.

It is based on the play of the same title by the French dramatist Jean Genet. The film stars Glenda Jackson as Solange, Susannah York as Claire, Vivien Merchant as Madame, and Mark Burns as Monsieur. The film was produced by Ely Landau for the American Film Theatre, which presented thirteen film adaptations of plays in the United States from 1973 to 1975.  Plot  Solange and Claire are two housemaids who construct elaborate sadomasochistic rituals when their mistress (Madame) is away. The focus of their role-playing is the murder of Madame, and they take turns portraying either side of the power divide. The deliberate pace and devotion to detail guarantees that they always fail to actualize their fantasies by ceremoniously \\"killing\\" Madame at the ritual's denouement.

The director, Christopher Miles planned the 12-day shoot with a single camera which could track anywhere over the set with the cinematographer Douglas Slocombe and deliberately implemented many of Genet's theatrical devices for the film. The camera was often static, the settings lush and extravagant.  Release  The film was shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.

If the relationship between the variables is non-spurious (there is a third variable that is not causing the effect), the temporal order is in line (cause before effect), and the study is longitudinal, it may be deduced that it is a causal relationship.  A functionalist theory of causation  Causation relates to moral and legal rules. Human society exercises social control and keeping society functional by enforcing rules. For rules to work society must be held accountable for their actions. all societies excluding animalistic ones have a concept of causality. Causality imposes moral obligations.Pickering, W. S. F..

History  The Japanese auto industry was expanding rapidly in the early 1960s, and the Imperial Household Agency sought a Japanese auto manufacturer to produce a suitable car for the Emperor of Japan. In September 1965, the Prince Motor Company announced that they would be providing two vehicles for the Emperor. The first would be ready by 1966, the other by 1967. In May 1966, Prince Motor Co. merged with Nissan Motor Co., and so Nissan was added to the name of the car. The Prince Motor Company had an established relationship with the Imperial Household Agency previously, when they presented the first Prince Gloria to Crown Prince Akihito as a one-year anniversary wedding gift, and an earlier gift to the Crown Prince called the Prince Sedan in 1954. The Prince Royal was the second Japanese built post-war vehicle to use a V8 engine; the first was the Toyota Crown Eight in 1964. Because of the massive weight at , a 6,437 cc (391 ci) Prince series W64 V8 with overhead valves, producing was used along with custom 8.90-15 Bridgestone tyres. Front independent double wishbone coil suspension, with leaf springs in the rear. Drum brakes were used with power assist. A three-speed GM Super Turbine 400 (THM400) automatic transmission is used, with the gear selector installed on the steering column.Motor Magazine International An American built transmission was used for expediency, in that Japanese manufacturers had not yet developed a transmission capable of coping with the torque from the Prince built V8 engine. When the Emperor is riding inside, the Imperial Standard is displayed on the top of the grille. An additional roundel, known as the Imperial Seal of Japan is also displayed at both the front and rear of the car in place of a license plate, and on the exterior of both rear passenger doors, displaying a 16 petal chrysanthemum, in golden colour, in reference to the Chrysanthemum Throne of Japan. The vehicle has coach doors for the center-rear that open with a wider angle. Interior features a total of eight passenger seats. There are three rows of seats. The two center rear seats are folding type for security personnel. In between the center seats is a beverage bar. The rear seats were covered in supple 100% wool upholstery, while the driver has leather seats. The windows have curtains and double pane glass, allowing the passenger compartment to be pressurized for additional security protection. A telephone is used to communicate to the driver. When the Prince Royal was in service, additional government transportation used the Nissan President for various transportation needs. The vehicles were retired on July 7, 2006, when the Toyota Century Royal was presented for service to replace them. Previous vehicles used to transport previous Emperors were a Rolls-Royce Phantom V used in the 1960s which replaced the Mercedes-Benz 770s that were used from the 1930s.

Edm√©-Martin Vandermaesen (Versailles, 11 November 1767 - 1 September 1813; also spelled Vander Maesen) was a French general of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He was killed in action while leading his troops to safety after the Battle of San Marcial in the Peninsular War. French Revolution Vandermaesen joined the Army in 1782 in the Touraine Regiment as a foot soldier, rising to lieutenant in 1792. He was employed as an instructor for the Jura battalion, then put in charge of the logistics, and eventually took command of the Jura battalion after a promotion to adjudant-major. He took part in the Battle of Wissembourg and in engagements in Haguenau, Vandenheim and Landau. General Michaud gave him command of the grenadiers of the division and sent him to capture the town of Brumpt, where a violent engagement occurred; Vandermaesen was wounded by a gunshot in the leg. In early 1794, he was promoted to chief of brigade (equivalent to a colonel), taking command of the 14th demi-brigade. He took part in fights at Mannheim, and led the crossing of the Rhine at Spire. Vandermaesen's and Decaen's units captured Frankenthal. The 14th demi- brigade was renamed 62nd demi-brigade, and took part in the battles of Offenburg, Rincken, Rastadt, Masch, Nerescheim, Geisenfeld, Neuboarg, Lesenfeld, and Biberach. Besieged in Kehl with the French Army, Vandermaesen conducted a number of sorties; under orders from Decaen, he retook advanced positions captured by the Austrians. The French Army crossed the Rhine again but was soon recalled after peace talks occurred in Leoben. At this time, Vandermaesen relinquished the command of the 62nd demi-brigade and took that of the 53rd, in the vanguard of the Army of Danube. At Ostrach, he was sent on a reconnaissance, taking a hundred prisoners; the next day, superior forces threatening to cut him from the French main corps, he was forced to retreat. Vandermaesen forced his way back to the main body of the French troops, and was again shot in the leg. He was mentioned in the report of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan about the affair, earning the rank of general of brigade. After another crossing the Rhine under fire, Vandermaesen captured Brisach, and made a junction with the Army of Switzerland. He took part in engagements against Swiss insurgents before being sent back to the Rhine Army, under general Laroche. He among the last French units on the right bank of the Rhine, while defending Mannheim and Neckarau. Vandermaesen was put in charge of the defence of Neckarau, with 6,000 men. On the 2nd complementary day of An VII (18 September 1799), Prince Charles' 30,000 men stormed the town. In a 6-hour fight, Vandermaesen retreated in good order towards Mannheim. The city itself fell soon afterwards, however. Vandermaesen's retreat was cut off and he was taken prisoner. Vandermaesen was exchanged on 5 January 1801 for General-Major Meczery, and returned to the Army in Salzburg. Napoleonic Empire After the Treaty of Amiens, Decaen was made captain general of Eastern colonies, and Vandermaesen was chosen to second him. He embarked at Brest on 15 vent√¥se an XI (6 March 1803), bound for Pondicherry, but with another war with England breaking out, the French division diverted to Isle de France (Mauritius). Vandermaesen was put in charge of the division, and was promoted in the Legion of Honour on 5 germinal an XII (26 March 1804); as second to the governor of Isle de France, he commanded the troops garrisoned there and in Isle Bourbon. After the surrender following the invasion of the isle de France, Vandermaesen returned to France, where he was received by Napoleon, and given command of a division under General of Division Caffarelli. Vandermaesen served in Spain from March 1812, along with Bertrand Clausel, in charge of the Army of Northern Spain. With 4,000 men and 500 horses, Vandermaesen battled Mina's guerillas, capturing his two artillery pieces. Shortly after being made a count of Empire, Vandermaesen's 5th Division fought in the Battle of San Marcial. In command of 10,000 men of the rearguard, he found that the Bidassoa River had risen too high for his soldiers to cross at the fords. The only bridge in the area was guarded by a company of British riflemen defending loopholed buildings while the gunpowder of the French was soaked by a heavy rain. While supervising the storming of the bridge at Vera in the early hours of September 1, 1813, Vandermaesen was killed by a gunshot in the side. Though the French suffered heavy casualties, the rest of the column escaped the trap due largely to a British error.Glover, p 263-264 His son was granted the title of baron in 1814.

(Mary and her sister, Etta's mother, had not seen each other for some 60 years - after Mary \\"stole\\" Etta's mother's boyfriend, Harry's father.) Etta finds her 85-year-old \\"Aunt M\\" being looked after by an inattentive, selfish cook-housekeeper called Mrs. Cullen. Aunt M herself is extremely inattentive and listless because Mrs. Cullen keeps her sedated with pills. Her son is too wrapped up in his own life to be interested and his wife is only waiting for the old woman to die so they will inherit her property. Her granddaughter Jill is the only one, besides Etta, who displays any genuine affection for the old woman. On the last day of Etta's visit, she and Mrs. Cullen have a row over what the latter has been giving Mrs. Grey to eat - or, rather, what she has not been feeding Mrs. Grey but keeping for herself to eat on her own. Mrs. Cullen quits, cousin Harry is distraught, and Etta promises to stay until he can sort out a new cook- housekeeper or Mrs. Cullen agrees to return. However, once Mrs. Cullen is gone and Aunt M is no longer being fed sleeping pills in place of food, the old woman begins to perk up. She and Etta strike up a tremendous friendship, and Aunt M takes revenge on her snooty daughter-in-law by inviting the family over to admire her new Mickey Mouse telephone and have tea and cakes - served on rotating musical cake stand. Harry and Etta are both pleased for Etta to stay and look after his mother. Harry's wife is not and drops a vitriolic bombshell: \\"Mother and your mother were adopted. You're not really related. You can call her \\"Aunt\\" if you want to but she isn't your aunt!\\" There is some foundation for her concern. When Mary dies, Etta is shocked to learn that Aunt M had made a new will leaving everything to her instead of to her son.

Peter did first start out as a drummer / vocalist for that band, but member- changes later on got him to play guitar instead. In 1998, Morgana Lefay split with their record label Black Mark and lost one guitarist, bassist and drummer at that time, Peter got in as guitarist and remains a member of that band still. Because of the change of record label, they also had to change band name, which ended up in simply Lefay. So his first recording with them was with the album \\"The Seventh Seal\\" in 1999. Except for playing guitar, he's also providing with backing vocals in the band, and also lead vocals a bit.

This was the 36th inauguration and marked the commencement of the only term of both Herbert Hoover as President and Charles Curtis as Vice President. Chief Justice and former President William Howard Taft administered the presidential oath of office to Hoover. This was the first presidential inauguration to be recorded by sound newsreels. It was also the second (and most recent) time that a former president administered the oath of office to a new President. The United States Constitution gives the President the option of either swearing the oath or affirming it. Hoover is often listed as having used \\"affirm\\" due to being a Quaker, but the newsreel taken of the ceremony indicates that the words used were \\"solemnly swear.\\" Franklin Pierce was the only president known to use the word \\"affirm\\" rather than \\"swear.\\" In administering the oath, Taft erroneously recited the phrase \\"preserve, protect and defend\\" as \\"preserve, maintain and defend\\". Helen Terwilliger, a 13-year-old eighth-grade student in Walden, New York, caught the error and wrote to the Chief Justice to tell him. Taft conceded that he had made an error, attributing it to \\"the defect of an old man's memory\\", but asserted that he had made a different error, misquoting the words as \\"preserve, maintain and protect\\". Terwilliger did not back down from her claim; the Fox Film Corporation, Pathe News and Paramount News, the companies who had prepared newsreels of the inauguration, examined their recordings and jointly confirmed Terwilliger's account.

Hollingworth never attended culinary school. Instead, he was determined to work for either Thomas Keller or Alain Ducasse. In 2001, he began as a commis at Thomas Keller's The French Laundry. At that time, Hollingsworth learned from former chefs de cuisine Eric Ziebold and Corey Lee, internalizing the heritage of the restaurant‚Äôs cuisine. In 2004, Keller selected Hollingsworth as part of a core team that traveled to New York City to train and prepare for the opening of his fine dining establishment in Manhattan, Per Se. After returning to The French Laundry, Hollingsworth was promoted to sous chef in 2005.
