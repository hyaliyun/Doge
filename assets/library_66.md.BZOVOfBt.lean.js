It has about 10,000 inhabitants, covers an area of 240 square kilometres and encompasses 21 villages. De Marne is mainly an agricultural area, focussing on crop growing and cattle farming. The fishing industry also plays an important role. Bulb cultivation is also an up- and-coming commercial endeavour. =Maren= De Marne has a large network of footpaths, cyclepaths, and sailing/canoeing routes. Of particular interest are the so-called 'maren': narrow waterways twisting and turning their way throughout the countryside. They are particularly suitable for recreational sailing and canoeing. The many marked walks, cycle routes and sail and drive routes connect all of the various villages. =Special attractions= Besides the well-known attractions such as the seal cr√®che in Pieterburen, the centre for mud flat walking and the Lauwersmeer area, there are also some other attractions. For instance, there is the Borg Verhildersum in Leens, Abraham's Mustard Museum in Eenrum and many churches, towers, listed heritage farms, terps and protected village settings. There are also famous church organs built by Arp Schnitger, Lohman (family) and Hinsz. =Pilgrimage= Statue of the Sorrowful Mother of Warfhuizen The hermitage of Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden in Warfhuizen is a popular Marian shrine. Processions go from Wehe-den Hoorn to Warfhuizen four or five times a year. A unique devotional practice is the 'swapping of the handkerchief'. According to Spanish tradition the statue of the crying Virgin usually holds a white handkerchief. The faithful bring a new white handkerchief and give it to the hermit to swap it with the one the Virgin has been holding which, in turn, is then given to someone sick or lonely. Students take it to their exams to calm their nerves. =The Lauwersmeer area= The Lauwersmeer area is a nature area suitable for fishing, bird watching, walking, and cycling. It features a few waters ports. The area covers about 90 square kilometres. The Lauwersmeer area came into existence when the Lauwerszee was closed off in 1969. Over the years the salt has slowly retreated from the water and new countryside has emerged. =Local products= There are a number of typical products of the area. An example of this is the 'Spelt Project'. This project ensures the production of pure local products. Farmers, millers, bakers, upholsterers and distillers work together to produce old-fashioned spelt grain, flour, bread, gin and cushions filled with spelt husks. =Municipal reorganisation= The municipality came into being in 1990 when the smaller municipalities of Eenrum, Kloosterburen, Leens and Ulrum were joined together. The local government employs about 115 people.

Communities * The unincorporated community of Bath is located within the southwestern corner of the township.  History  Bath Township was originally organized in 1839 as Ossowa Township, having been split from DeWitt Township by an act of the governor. It was renamed Bath Township in 1843 after Bath, New York. Park Lake at the southern edge of the township was the source of the Park Lake Trail, an important Native American trailway that intersected the Okemah Trail in what later became the city of East Lansing, Michigan. Park Lake developed into a regional recreation destination for the growing Lansing population after the state capitol relocated to Lansing in 1847 and the Michigan Agricultural College was established in East Lansing, Michigan in 1855. By the early 1900s Park Lake was surrounded by summer camps affiliated with various churches and associations as well as seasonal cabins and lodges. The most ambitious of these was the Park Lake Resort which featured a large dance pavilion built over the water on pilings. The Park Lake Dance Pavilion served as an entertainment venue playing host to many famous acts such as Tommy Dorsey until it burned in the 1930s. Years of decline followed and Park Lake never regained its former popularity. Bath Township was the scene of the Bath School bombing, which is the deadliest act of mass murder in a school in United States history. It claimed more than three times as many victims as the Columbine High School massacre and twice as many victims as the Virginia Tech and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings.

History DeWitt was named after DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York during the 1820s. It was first settled by Captain David Scott, who moved there from Ann Arbor in 1833, and platted the land. The State Legislature formally created DeWitt Township on March 23, 1836. The first township meeting was held at the house of Captain Scott on April 8, 1836. A gentleman by the name of Welcome J. Partelo was named the township's first Supervisor at that meeting. It did not take long for the state to divide DeWitt Township into the many townships that we recognize today. In 1837, the township was split in half by a north‚Äìsouth line; the western half became Watertown Township. Two years later, the township was again split in half by an east‚Äìwest line, and the northern half became Bingham Township. One day later, the governor approved an act, which split the remaining township area in half by an east‚Äìwest line, and the eastern half became Ossowa Township (renamed Bath Township in 1857). The final split of the township came in 1841 when the northern half of the remaining land became Olive Township. In four years, DeWitt Township went from encompassing the entire county to its current boundary. The county seat for Clinton County was also located in DeWitt Township from the inception of the county. The county seat remained in DeWitt Township until December 1857 when it was moved to high Hall, in the village of St. Johns, until a new courthouse could be built.

On October 21, 1930, a great fire swept though the downtown business district, destroying eight historic and business buildings. This included the destruction of the Clinton House/Hotel, which was a regionally famous establishment. The fire devastated the community, stagnating business growth once again. However, residential development did not slow, and thus DeWitt began its evolvement into the bedroom community that it is today. The Village of Dewitt was incorporated into a city in 1965.

The population was 1,884 at the 2010 census. The city is surrounded by Grayling Charter Township, but the two are administered autonomously. The city is located in the middle of the Northern Michigan region at the junctions of Interstate 75, U.S. Route 127, M-72, and M-93. Grayling is well known for hosting the Au Sable River Canoe Marathon in July of every year since 1947. The city is named after the Grayling species of fish once abundant in the Au Sable River, although the species has long since been extinct in the area. There have been many attempts to bring Grayling back to the area but none have been successful. History Michael Shoat Hartwick was Grayling's first settler. On the west side of the railroad tracks, he built a log hotel. The railroad platted out 40 acres (where Grayling now stands), naming it \\"Crawford\\". Fish swimming in the river were identified as grayling, and it is said that the residents preferred the name \\"Grayling\\" to the name \\"Crawford,\\" and renamed the area after the fish. Grayling's access to two major rivers (Au Sable River and Manistee River), and the presence of the vast forest around it, made it important in the lumber era. Logs were floated down the rivers to the lakes. Grayling had other names through the years. It was called \\"AuSable\\", \\"Forest\\", \\"Crawford Station\\", and during the lumbering era \\"Milltown\\".Ibid. Lumbering practices destroyed Arctic grayling breeding grounds in rivers and contributed to their slow decline and eventual disappearance from Northern Michigan. The Arctic grayling that had inhabited much of Northern Michigan was eventually wiped out. The logging practice of using river beds to move logs in the springtime destroyed the breeding grounds for these fish. Before they could recover, non-native sport fish such as brook trout were introduced in the 1890s and competed with the grayling for food. The Grayling Fish Hatchery was founded in 1914 by timber baron Rasmus Hanson (1846‚Äì1927). He hoped to restore the grayling to the Au Sable River system; ironically, its disappearance was caused, at least in part, by the massive habitat destruction caused by logging, which was the source of Mr. Hanson's and other lumber barons' immense wealth. Other famous contributors to the initial costs of the hatchery included Henry Ford, Edsel Ford, and Thomas Edison. The grayling became extinct in Michigan. Nevertheless, the hatchery continued to play an important role in natural resource conservation. In 1926, it was sold to the state of Michigan. It continued to be operated as a fish hatchery and tourist attraction until the mid-1960s. In 1995, Michigan sold the property to Crawford County. It is being operated by a privately owned fish farm, although continues to be open to the public during the summer. An important person in the history of Grayling is Rasmus Hanson. Hanson was born in 1846 in Denmark and immigrated to the United States in 1867 at age 16, when he began work in the lumber field. Two years later, E. N. Salling, Nelson Michelson, and he organized the first Salling-Hanson Company. After nearly 50 years of service, the Salling Hanson Company had shut down its operation in January 1927. He was a successful entrepreneur and created many businesses in Northern Michigan. Along with being one of three lumber barons of Northern Michigan, Hanson owned the Michigan Sugar Company and the Bay City Sugar Company. In 1916, he donated 13,826 acres of cut-over land in Crawford County to the state of Michigan for use as a forest game preserve and military reservation. This land became the first state-owned game preserve. The area south of Lake Margrethe (named in honor of Hanson‚Äôs wife, Margrethe) continues to be used as a National Guard base that serves Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana guards., originally published in the Otsego County Herald Times, October 6, 1927 Since 1947, Grayling has been the starting point of the Au Sable River Canoe Marathon, which is held every year on the last weekend of July.

The population was 12,616 at the 2010 census, making it the third- largest city in the Upper Peninsula after Marquette and Sault Ste. Marie. It is the seat of government of Delta County. There is also Escanaba Township, which is north of the city and is not adjacent to it, although a portion of the urban area around the city extends into the township. Both are named for the Escanaba River, which flows into the Little Bay de Noc of Lake Michigan just north of the city at . The names are derived from the Ojibwa language.  History  C&NW; railway station in Escanaba, Michigan, 1953 Escanaba was the name of an Ojibwa village in this area in the early 19th century. The Ojibwa are one of the Anishinaabe, Algonquian-speaking tribes who settled and flourished around the Great Lakes. The word \\"Escanaba\\" roughly translates from Ojibwe and other regional Algonquian languages to \\"land of the red buck\\", although some people maintain that it refers to \\"flat rock\\". As a European- American settlement, Escanaba was founded in 1863 as a port town by surveyor Eli P. Royce. Early industry was the processing and harvesting of lumber, dominated in this area by Daniel Wells Jr., Jefferson Sinclair, and Nelson Ludington. Ludington later moved his headquarters to Chicago, where he also entered banking. I. Stephenson established a successor lumber company in the area and also became a capitalist. Before the war, iron ore was being mined from the Marquette Range, which shipped out on barges from Escanaba. By the time of the American Civil War, this port was important to the Union as a shipping point for these ores, in addition to lumber. The Menominee Range and Gogebic Range of Michigan became important for iron ore after the war, in the 1880s. Michigan still produces about 25% of the iron ore nationally. Initially lumber was still integral to shipbuilding, and supported the construction of houses in cities throughout the developing Midwest. Iron ore supported industrialization, and became part of steel and other industries in the Midwest. As shipping increased, a lighthouse was needed to warn of a sand shoals in Little Bay de Noc, which extended from Sand Point, a sandspit located just south of and adjacent to the harbor area. The United States Lighthouse Service approved construction of the Sand Point Lighthouse at a cost of $11,000. Construction began in the fall of 1867 and was completed in early spring 1868. =Present day= Until 2017, Escanaba continued to serve as an important shipping point for iron ore to other Great Lakes ports, especially south to Chicago and northern Indiana. The local paper mill, for many years owned by Mead Corporation's Publishing Paper Division, is currently operated by Verso Corporation. Located on the outskirts of the city alongside the Escanaba River, it is now Escanaba's largest employer. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. =Climate= This climatic region is classified as humid continental climate, abbreviated \\"Dfb\\", according to the K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification. It is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. Escanaba is described as being in the banana belt of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. While most of the peninsula is affected by significant lake-effect snow, Escanaba's winter climate is much milder due to its location on the leeward Lake Michigan shoreline.

First settled in 1877, Gladstone's original name was Minnewasca. The population was 4,973 at the 2010 census. U.S. Highways 2 and 41 run concurrently through the city, connecting with Escanaba, nine miles (14 km) to the south. US 41 runs north to Marquette and US 2 runs east to Manistique and St. Ignace. M-35 runs northwest to Gwinn and merges with US 2/US 41 south to Escanaba. History =First settlers= Throughout the early 19th century, the area where Gladstone exists was largely uninhabited other than Ojibwe hunters in the area or the occasional Euro-American trapper or fisherman. Gladstone was first settled in 1859 when the Hamilton Corporation of Fayette began using it as a shipping point for selling and transporting of their iron ore.Gladstone Centennial Book Community (1987). Gladstone Centennial History. Gladstone Centennial Book Community. Pp 12‚Äì47. ASIN B0010K5HFW The town was originally named Minnewasca by the Soo Line Railroad, the Ojibwa name meaning \\"white water.\\" When the name was filed with the county and Secretary of State in Lansing, Senator W. D. Washburn, who had an interest in building the railroad, persuaded officials to change the name to Gladstone in honor of British premier, William Evert Gladstone. Earliest development was on Saunders Point, so named for Capt. Nate Saunders who headquartered there when fishing at various points along the bay, was the location for the initial build-up of Gladstone. Today, Saunder's Point still exists as a small peninsula east of Gladstone's city park system, located in Little Bay De Noc. Expanding beyond its iron ore roots into a shipping point for lumber, coal, and copper during the American civil war, throughout the 1860s and 1870s, Gladstone grew into a busy port. =Change of name= In 1876, the Hamilton Corporation had to move its operations when their mine dried up. The new mine location, further south, meant shipping their ore through the Escanaba port. Arthur Delano, the president of Soo Line Railroad, had commissioned a train depot built in Saunder's Point during the previous winter to start land shipping for the Hamilton Corporation.The Trains staff (November 1990). Timeline. Trains, pp. 21‚Äì47 However, since this was no longer possible, Delano began commissioning local industries. Gladstone was incorporated as a village in 1887 and as a city in 1889.Walter Romig, Michigan Place names, p. 224 Gladstone is named after the English statesman William Ewart Gladstone. Geography Welcome sign with Little Bay de Noc in the background The city is on a small projection into the Little Bay de Noc, which opens onto Green Bay on Lake Michigan. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. =Climate= Due to the city's proximity to Lake Michigan, Gladstone consistently has high humidity and experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are warm and humid, with average high temperatures in the mid 80s and average lows in the mid 60s. Winters are cold, snowy and windy with temperatures often below freezing. Spring and fall are mild with low humidity. According to the National Weather Service, Gladstone's record low comes in at -60 on January 7, 1896 . To this day, this storm is referred to by Gladstone residents as \\"les morte a doigts,\\" since so many of the city's residents lost fingers due to frostbite. On July 19, 1992, Gladstone experienced a rare tornado which caused moderate damage throughout the city. =Neighborhoods= Although Gladstone is a relatively small city, it has several distinct sections: Downtown (which hosts most of the local businesses), The Buckeye (located on the western side of the city, bordering the Brampton, MI township), and the Bluff (which hosts most of the new residential expansion, as well as Gladstone High School). Gladstone High School sports teams are referred to as the Braves, which along with the Escanaba Eskymos give Delta County two schools bearing indigenous symbols although Eskimo is spelled Eskymo to reflect the nickname ‚ÄúEsky‚Äù. Culture =Tourism and parks= Gladstone is often referred to as \\"The Year Round Playground\\" because of its myriad parks and activities. Gladstone's main park is Van Cleve, which hosts a playground (Kid's Kingdom), a skateboarding park, baseball field, basketball court, fitness trail, a white sand beach with water slide, boardwalk, as well as a harbor with boat ramps and fish cleaning station. Gladstone also offers the Gladstone Golf Course which eats a lot of balls while winding through the famous U.P. Forest and crossing water on 6 of 18 holes. Another Gladstone attraction is the Gladstone Sports Park, which hosts several baseball fields, skiing and snowboarding runs and a tubing facility. The Park itself is often rented out for other activities, including wedding receptions, and high school graduation parties. Gladstone also hosts the Days River Trails, which are hiked and biked in the spring, summer, and fall. In the winter, these trails are used primarily for cross-country skiing. Gladstone had much more tourism in the 1950s. The decline started when the state built I-75 from St. Ignace to Sault Ste. Marie, routing the \\"Around the Lake\\" tourism directly out of the state into Canada. The second death blow Gladstone is beginning to recover from was building a 4-lane expressway which bypasses downtown Gladstone, thus causing limited access from one end of Gladstone to the other. These two acts committed Gladstone to bedroom community status for the future. All shopping and many jobs are in Escanaba. However, the white sand beaches, clear warm water and walleyes are still there and the many crafty tourists return every year and are not letting on. The rest of the U.P. and Wisconsin shorelines are exposed with cold lake water. Only in Gladstone's Little Bay de Noc do these conditions hold true. (Sources: The highway features are still there.) =Economy= Despite economic troubles in the region, Gladstone is the home of many thriving businesses including Marble Arms, Besse Forest Products, Canadian National Railway, VanAire Inc, Independent Machine Co., Pardon Inc., Bramco Containers, Hoegh Pet Caskets, Brampton Bike and Ski, Bay de Noc Lure Company (makers of the \\"Swedish Pimple\\" and \\"Do-Jigger\\"), Main Street Pizza, D&M; Subs, The Dairy Flo, Gladstone Square Pharmacy, and The Saloon. Many of Gladstone's residents also find work in Escanaba, particularly with one of the New Page Corporation's mills, which is the area's largest employer. =Media= Gladstone was featured in the 2010 documentary film Catfish. Transportation Soo Line locomotive 4-6-2 Pacific H-3 (730) sits off of US 2. * exists in two discontinuous segments, with the western portion running from Everett, Washington and through Gladstone before ending at Interstate 75 in St. Ignace, Michigan.

Environmental importance Iron Mountain's abandoned Millie Hill mine is home to one of the largest bat hibernacula in the Midwest. Roughly 25,000-50,000 bats make their winter home there. Menominee Range Geologic map of the Iron Mountain area Iron Mountain is located within the Menominee Iron-Bearing District, which covers southern Dickinson County and extends westward into Iron County. Iron ore was discovered in Dickinson County in 1849 and Iron County in 1851. Ore is produced from the middle Precambrian Vulcan Iron-Formation around Iron Mountain, and the Riverton Iron-Formation between Iron River, Michigan and Crystal Falls, Michigan. Both formations belong to the Marquette Range Supergroup. The Vulcan is between 300 and 800 feet thick and consists of hematite and magnetite with quartz, while the Riverton is 100‚Äì600 feet thick and consists of siderite and chert. Historical importance Iron Mountain was once a mining city when the Chapin Mine was up and running. The land that the Chapin Mine was formed on was discovered in 1879. It was discovered by two men, James John Hagerman and Dr. Nelson Powell Hulst. They had leased the land from a man from Niles, Michigan, Henry Chapin, hence the name of the mine. They began to sink shafts on the slope of Millie Hill. Then on July 5, 1879, Captain John Wicks and seven other men were sent into the forest with a wagon filled with tools to search for a place to set up camp. After numerous unsuccessful shafts the company was ready to shut down operation. Hagerman and Hulst had faith in the land and tried one more shaft. The shaft was deep and many months later, there was a successful hit that was at the heart of the iron ore. The original land was very swampy and filled with trees. To get rid of all this water the Chapin Mine Pumping Engine was created. Iron Mountain is home of the largest steam-driven pumping engine in the United States. Chapin Mine Steam Pump Engine (Cornish Pump) was patterned after the ones used in Cornwall in the deep tin mines. Edwin Reynolds, chief engineer for the E.P. Allis Company (now the Allis-Chalmers Co.) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, designed the steam engine in 1890. The engine's high-pressure cylinder has a bore, and the low-pressure cylinder is in diameter. The flywheel is in diameter, weighs 160 tons, and had an average speed of only 10 revolutions per minute. The drive shaft to the flywheel is in diameter. The engine itself rises above the floor of the room. The designers estimate the weight to be 725 tons over all. The pumping equipment utilized a reciprocating motion to a line of steel rods extending down into the mine, with eight pumps attached at intervals of 170 to along the rods. Each of the pumps forced the water to the next higher pump and finally out to the surface of the mine. As the engine was designed to run slowly, the pumps had a capacity of over 300 gallons per stroke of the pistons. At ten revolutions per minute, this meant over 3,000 gallons of water poured out through a pipe every minute. A total of 5,000,000 gallons of water could be removed from the mine each day. At that time the pump's estimated cost was nearly $250,000. After only a few years of successful operation, the giant pumping facility was moved from the \\"D\\" shaft of the Chapin Mine. More than a million tons of the best grade ore found in the entire mine was discovered directly below the pump, so it was essential that it be moved for excavation. In 1898 the pump was dismantled and stored away until 1907 when it was reassembled on the \\"C\\" shaft of the Chapin Mine. The pump operated here until 1932 when the Chapin Mine permanently closed its doors. In 1934 the pumping engine was offered to the County of Dickinson as a relic for sightseers to visit. The pump remained exposed to the elements for nearly 50 years, and in 1982 a building was constructed around the pump by the Menominee Range Historical Foundation. Today the Cornish Pumping Engine & Mining Museum exists on the site. The Chapin Mine Pumping Engine (Cornish Pump) was designated as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Monument by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers on June 6, 1987 and has been featured in the History Channel's Modern Marvels Series on the World's Biggest Machines.

History Carmel Valley dates back to the Rancho Los Laureles, which was a Mexican land grant in present-day Monterey County, California given in 1839 by Governor Juan Alvarado to Jos√© M. Boronda and Vicente Blas Mart√≠nez.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The grant extended along the Carmel River and the Carmel Valley; and encompasses present day Carmel Valley. In 1882, the Pacific Improvement Company (PIC) purchased the Rancho Los Laureles. In 1916, Samuel F.B. Morse became the manager of the PIC and his job was to liquidate the PIC holdings (10,000 acres). In 1919, Morse formed the Del Monte Properties and acquired PIC. In 1923, the Del Monte Properties divided the land into 11 parcels. Marion Hollins bought 2,000 acres. In 1926, developer Frank Porter bought 600 acres. He later acquired a portion of the Hollins ranch and sold it to Byington Ford. Byington and his wife Marion used 400-acres as a summer ranch and named it Moon Trail Ranch. It was located at Via Las Encinas in Carmel Valley. Carmel Valley Airport In 1946, Byington Ford and his brother, Tirey Ford Jr., developed the \\"Airway Village\\" that years later was renamed the Carmel Valley Village. It included an Airway Market. By 1947, the Airway General Store, barbershop, drug store (with soda fountain), beauty shop, Stirrup Cup bar, and the Grapevine liquor store had been built. All were in walking distance of the Airpark and decorated to resemble a Mexican village. Ford and his brother developed the Carmel Valley Airport for pilot-owners who would want to be ‚Äúat home a minute or two after getting out of their planes.‚Äù His brother Tirey built a prototype hangar house off Ford Road at the west end of the airfield to serve as an example for the airborne community of the future. Following the War it became apparent that there would not be a plane in every garage, so Ford had to adjust his enterprise, combining sales to plane owners with sales to home seekers. He enjoyed a brisk trade. Only 2 true hangar houses were ever built at Carmel Valley Airport: Tirey's (which later burned), and one other, still standing on the north side of the runway. Non-pilots bought up many of the runway Airpark sites, and to suit their many tastes Byington created ranch-house sites of 1-3 acres and envisioned hillside homes where residents could look down on incoming planes. During World War II, the airfield served as an alternative landing field for military planes flying out of Watsonville and King City. A clubhouse built for the Airpark later became an integral part of the Village's Blue Sky Lodge, which is still in operation today.

After kidnapping Roach with the help of a local gunslinger named Anastacio Garcia, they held Roach in a jail cell in Stockton until he agreed to release the widow's gold. But Roach had bribed a guard to ride to Monterey and urge Roach's family to hide the gold. Chief Justice of California David S.

The population was 1,234 at the 2010 census. The village is located within Windsor Charter Township. Dimondale is a suburb of Lansing, which is northeast of the village in Ingham County. History The Potawatomi originally had a permanent camp along the Grand River in the Dimondale area before white settlement began in the 1830s. Relations between white settlers (most of whom were from New York and New England) and the Potowatomie were generally cordial with local residents permanently deeding of land near the river to the local Indians. The local band held the deed to the leased land until the Potowatomie were forced west by the Indian Removal Act. Isaac M. Dimond came to the area in 1848 and, as one of his enterprises, in 1850 began to construct a dam, just east of Silver Creek on the Grand River near the center of section 15. By 1852, the dam was completed and a saw mill was in operation. He built a grist mill in 1856. On August 6, 1856, Hosey Harvey surveyed the village in order for Dimond to have it platted with the name \\"Dimondale\\". An unusual feature of the village is that its streets run Northeast to Southwest and Northwest to Southeast, while most streets and roads in the surrounding area, indeed the whole Midwest, run North-South and East-West. Its borders make a rough diamond shape on a map. A post office named \\"East Windsor\\" had been established in the eastern part of Windsor Township in about 1860. This office was transferred to Dimondale and renamed in 1872. In 1878 the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway came through and the area was given a station referring to it as Dimondale. In 1906, Dimondale incorporated as a village. From 1929 to 1963, Dimondale had its own high school, until it merged with the Holt School District. This occurred after the school district ran into tax issues due to the sparse business landscape in the village. The final Superintendent for Dimondale was Harvey E. Wood, a school administrator who later moved to Holt's system as the Transportation Manager, then eventually to Ingham Intermediate School District (IISD) as Vice Superintendent. Dimondale almost merged with the Eaton Rapids School district, however due to Mr. Wood's prior mentor/student relationship with Holt's Superintendent (Maurice Pernert), the merge with Holt's school system took place. In 1962, Interstate 96 was built through Windsor Township, bringing many new businesses to the area. In the 1960s‚Äì70s, Dimondale served as a regionally and nationally recognized hotspot for championship horseshoe pitching, earning it the nickname \\"Horseshoe Capital of the World.\\" The Dimondale Horseshoe Club was founded in 1964 and the village played host to the 1965 Michigan state tournament. In 1970, DHC merged with the Chief Okemos Sportsman's Club, which is still in existence. Dimondale natives and accomplished horseshoe pitchers James Compton, Gilbert Kimball, Pat Smith, Victor Benson, Fred Smith Sr., and Fred Smith Jr. have been inducted into the Wolverine State Horseshoe Pitcher's Association (WSHPA) Hall of Fame. The greatest horseshoe pitching legend emanating from the clay courts of Dimondale tells how Fred Smith Jr. would have his brother Norman place his chin atop an opposing stake while Fred would proceed to pitch ringers that would clang just inches below Norman's smiling face.

The population was 5,214 at the 2010 census. The city is located in the south of Eaton Rapids Township, on the boundary with Hamlin Township, though it is politically independent of both townships. Its nickname is the Island City, since the downtown is located on an island, with a public park, in the Grand River. , Eaton Rapids, MI History The Potawatomi people established a village in the area of what is now Eaton Rapids in about 1774. This was part of their wide territory in historic times.R. David Edmonds, The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978), p. 99 The area constituting Eaton Rapids was first settled by Euro-Americans around the year 1835, who were drawn there because of the timber and water power in the area. It became a center of industry. The following year, a sawmill was constructed near Spring Brook in Spicerville; it provided the lumber settlers used to build Eaton Rapids. In 1837, the Old Red Mill was constructed by the mill company; it used waterpower from the stream to grind corn. The mill company later used wood from Spicerville to construct their own sawmill along the Grand River, as well as a wool carding mill. In 1852, mineral water was first discovered by E.B. Frost, earning Eaton Rapids worldwide fame and the nickname The Saratoga of the West, referring to Saratoga Springs, New York, which had tourism based on such waters. This water was in huge demand, and resulted in many people coming to take mineral water baths, considered to have health benefits, as well as cures from specific ailments. Fourteen wells were drilled in total to supply water for the baths. Only three are still operational. In 1921, John B. Davidson, Sr. came to Eaton Rapids from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He started the only textile mill in Michigan that spun its own yarn. The Davidson Mill supplied 95% of the wool yarn for major league baseball uniforms, as well as high-grade yarns for other applications. After 48 years in business, the mill burned in 1969. John B. Davidson became a politician, elected as mayor of Eaton Rapids, and later representing the area in both the State House and State Senate. In 1927, Irving Jacob Reuter and his wife Janet built Medovue, a 17-room, 10,000-square foot, Tudor Revival- style mansion, where they lived for nine years. President of the Oldsmobile automobile company, Reuter was also a financier and inventor. The Reuters donated substantial sums to charity. Their property was sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing, and became the private residence of its first Bishop, the Most Reverend Joseph H. Albers.Archdiocese of Lansing home page and history The diocese later sold the mansion. It was purchased by CJ and Mille Sumner, who adapted it and reopened it to operate as an Adult Foster Care Home. They furnished it with antiques and named it \\"Ivy Manor\\". The home was sold again in 1990 and was renovated for use as a bed and breakfast, known as the English Inn. In 1991 it was recognized and listed in the state List of Registered Historic Places in Michigan.English Inn history page The original building, complete with many of the original antique furnishings, has of gardens and pastoral countryside located on the river. It was purchased by Gary and Donna Nelson in 1996, who also developed a restaurant and pub on the property. It is open to the public for viewing.

As of the 2010 census, the township population was 281. Communities *Cross Village is an unincorporated community and census- designated place in the township on a rise overlooking Lake Michigan at . M-119 has its northern terminus here, with Petoskey about to the south along the Lake Michigan shore. History This general area was known as Waganakisi by the Ottawa people. Cross Village itself was a village known to the Ottawa as Anamiewatigoing. It lost its importance when the Jesuit missionaries founded New L'Arbre Croche at what is now Harbor Springs in 1830.Walter Romig, Michigan Place Names, p. 140 Cross Village, like many of the area's small towns, was once a thriving center for lumber. Because of its location on the lakeshore it was also a fishing community. Cross Village is one of the oldest settlements in Michigan and today is known for its ties to the Ottawa people. The Cross Village Heritage Museum is housed in the old Town Hall. Early records say that Father Jacques Marquette, the famous French Jesuit who endeared himself to the Native American population of northern Michigan, planted a huge white cross on the bluff overlooking Lake Michigan before his death in 1675. As late as 1787, as many as twenty tribes populated the region and met here around tribal council fires. To the Natives who populated the numerous historic missions in the area, Cross Village became known as the \\"Land of the Cross\\". To the French, this region was known as \\"L'Arbre Croche\\"; to the Ottawas, it was called \\"Wau-gaw-naw-ke-ze\\"; and to the English-speaking people at the time, it was simply known as \\"Land of the Crooked Tree\\". Bishop Frederic Baraga is another individual with historical ties to Cross Village. Baraga left a comfortable, aristocratic existence behind when he left Slovenia. He arrived in Michigan in 1830 to serve the Native population and isolated small communities of this region. He spoke and developed written Native languages and is credited for spreading the Gospel among the local Ottawas and Ojibwe. In 1853, Baraga was elevated to Bishop in the Catholic Church, becoming the first bishop in Upper Michigan. Father Francis Xavier Pierz, Bishop Baraga's friend and fellow Slovenian, was also assigned to Cross Village for many years. Father Pierz, however, was bothered by the increasingly settled nature of the region and departed for the newly organized Minnesota Territory in 1852. In 1855 Emmet County was reorganized and four new townships were created by the state. One of them was \\"La Croix\\", which was officially changed its name to \\"Cross Village\\" in 1875. The Holy Cross Church which had primarily Ojibwe members was operational until at least 1930.Bentley Historical Library guide to Native American sources Today, a replica of Father Marquette's cross stands at the edge of the bluff and is visible from off shore, far into Lake Michigan. Every year a small garden at the base of the cross is lovingly tended by the town's garden club. The \\"Tunnel of Trees\\" portion of M-119 running between Good Hart and Cross Village The \\"Tunnel of Trees\\", a breathtaking scenic drive down the winding Lake Michigan shoreline runs between Cross Village and Harbor Springs to the south. The drive is famed for its fall color scenery. Cross Village is also home to Blissfest and the annual pow wow.

In November 2000, the township, along with the cities of Fenton and Linden, passed a millage to turn the Tri-County Parks & Recreation share department into a parks and recreation metropolitan district. While Argentine Township and Tyrone Townships defeated the millage. Tri-County ceased operation on December 1, 2000, when the Southern Lakes Regional Parks & Recreation District began operations.

The population was 8,389 at the 2010 census. Flushing is considered a suburb of Flint. It is situated within the survey area of Flushing Charter Township, but is administratively autonomous. Flushing originated as a mill town in the mid-1830s. Its location along the Flint River, the county's largest river, was a decisive factor in its settlement. Water power potential was a significant determinant for the selection of the settlement areas throughout the nineteenth century. In addition to its water power, the area around Flushing was also well suited to agricultural pursuits. The name Dover originally was selected for the new village until it was discovered that the name already was in use in Lenawee County Michigan. Charles Seymour, Sr., former resident of Flushing, Long Island, subsequently named the new community after the village in New York State. History The earliest known inhabitants of Flushing were the Sauk Indians. Evidence suggesting that the second battle of Skull Island was fought in Flushing, including mass burial mounds, were found along the Flint river near the Bailey farm; now the present day Flushing Valley Golf Club. Mounds were observed in 1833 or 1834 and about 20 mounds in total. In 1835, Charles Seymour Sr. from New York state came to the Flushing area after purchasing land there. He formed a partnership with Horace Jerome in 1836 who had purchased water rights in the vicinity. In their partnership, Seymour would provide pine timber while Jerome would build a mill. The saw mill was operational in the summer of 1837. Jerome left Flushing after his wildcat bank, the Flint Rapids Bank, failed in 1838. A village plat on sections 26 and 27, bearing the name of Flushing and named after the township in which it was located, was laid out December 3, 1840 by Charles Seymour Sr. In 1843 Charles sold out to his brother James Seymour. James then made an additional plat, 31, in 1847. in 1850, a flat-bottomed boat established early transportation between Flint and Flushing. On July 30, 1873, village women formed the Flushing Ladies' Association. In 1874, a subscription private fire department, the Wolverine Fire Company, was formed with 35 members and Arza N. Niles as first chief engineer. Wolverine paid for a small engine designed by Captain Haas of Flint of his own design and patent. Flushing was incorporated as a village on March 21, 1877 with its first election held on May 8, 1877. Oscar F. Clarke was elected as the first village president. After incorporation, the fire company turned over its equipment to the village. In 1878, the Haas engine was instrument in containing a major fire in the business district to just a saloon and hotel. The Flushing Patrol, the village's first professional newspaper, was founded on October 18, 1878 by D. C. Ashmun. In 1880 the paper sold for $1.50 per year. The paper would cost 1 dollar per year. The paper touts \\"The Interests of Flushing and Vicinity Will Be Observed Herein\\". On June 15, 1882, DeWitt C. Ashmun sold his paper, The Flushing Patrol, to Albert E. Ransom who changed its name to \\"The Flushing Observer\\".The Flushing Observer also published its first paper under that name on that same date The railroad was first brought to Flushing in 1888. Headed by John Ashley, the Toledo and Ann Arbor Railroad connected Flushing to Durand and Saginaw. Construction reached Flushing in July 1888. On Monday, Dec. 17, 1888, the first passenger train arrived from Saginaw. The fare from Flushing to Saginaw was 80 cents. Railroad engine crosses Flint river for the first time to Hart & Clark mill on February 7, 1889. March 25, 1895 vote passes 215 to 30 for $20,000 bond to build a water works system and electric light plant. Water mains are first installed for use on Nov 1, 1895. Electricity was installed and ready for use on Nov 15, 1895, along with streetlights on Main St. By January 1897 there were 1600 incandescent lamps in the village. The Hart Flour Mill is destroyed in a fire on March 19, 1918. It was the 3rd Mill on the site and the 3rd to burn. The mill provided electricity until it burned down in 1918, leaving the village without power for 14 months until a new power plant was built. Main Street was paved in 1920. In May 1922 the current bridge on Main Street over the Flint river is completed. The bridge is a traditionally composed earth-filled closed spandrel concrete arch bridge built by L. Smith, H. A. and M. C. Nichols of Hastings, Michigan. The bridge was rehabilitated in 1998 adding new walkways and updated guardrails. The first wood bridge was built on this site in 1839.

Goodrich traveled via steam ship from Buffalo to Detroit to settle after they had sold their home in the summer of 1835. They journeyed from Detroit towards modern-day Pontiac, where they met land explorers who told them of the land's beauty. When they reached the vicinity of Davison's Mill (now Atlas), they found rich, fertile soil, an excess of timber, and readily available water. They returned to Detroit and purchased one thousand acres (4 km) at $1.25 per acre. They returned to their old home in Clarence, New York and prepared to return to their purchased property. It was decided that Moses and Levi, the eldest and third of the six brothers, would travel back via Canada. They completed their journey in 16 days, and built a cabin before the family arrived on May 20, 1836. The first wood-frame house was built for Enos Goodrich in 1838. The first tavern, The Goodrich House, was built in 1846 by a Mr. Matthew Davidson. This was a popular spot for trading and salesman. In over one hundred years, there were several owners, the most notable being Ben Yerkey, The Cicote Brothers (famous for their baseball career) and Emery Rockafellow. After the Death of Rockefellow, the tavern was bought by S. M. Hegel. The house fell victim to a fire in 2009 and was subsequently torn down.

Afterwards, pioneer families began settling in the township. Jacob Stevens settled at the survey township center and future city with his family in 1823. Stony Run post office was formed in the area when it was in Oakland County on June 6, 1934 with Marston W. Richards as the first postmaster. The oldest unit of government in Genesee County, Grand Blanc Township was organized on March 9, 1833 by the Territory of Michigan. Then the township included the survey area of the future townships of Atlas, Burton, Davison, Fenton, Flint, Genesee, Mount Morris and Mundy. With the March 2, 1836 formation of Flint Township, Grand Blanc lost in addition the township survey areas of Burton, Genesee and Mount Morris to Flint. With the July 26, 1836 organization of Argentine Township, Grand Blanc lost Fenton to the new township. Mundy was split off on its March 11, 1837 organization. By March 1843, Atlas and Davison had been organized. The township center began to boom in 1864 with the arrival of the railroad (now known as the CSX Saginaw Subdivision).

The population was 6,224 at the 2010 census, a slight decrease from 6,336 at the 2000 census. The City of Montrose is surrounded by the township, but is politically and administratively autonomous. Montrose Charter Township is located in the northwest corner of Genesee County, bisected nearly down the middle by the Flint River. It is a six-mile square Township with the City of Montrose occupying approximately one square mile in the middle of the Township. M-57 (Vienna Rd) splits the Township in half and is a major connector to I-75, which is located 2.5 miles east of the Township limits. History In 1847, the township was formed from neighboring Vienna Township and was known as Pewonigowink Township. This name was derived from the Pewonigowink Indian Reservation, of the Saginaw Chippewa, that extended into the northwest part of the Township. On January 15, 1848, the name was officially changed to Montrose Township, by an act of the Michigan Legislature. The Township was originally studded with pine woodlands and during the first years of the white man's occupancy, the inhabitants were chiefly engaged in various occupations related to a lumbering region. Montrose Township was the last settled district in Genesee County. Today, its landscape is mostly agricultural. The Township incorporated as a Charter Township on March 26, 1985.[1] The first white settlers in the township were the family members of Seymour Washington Ensign, a miller by trade, from Stafford, Genesee County, New York. Ensign came to Genesee County, Michigan in the spring of 1832, accompanied by his wife Tamma Fanny (Husted) Ensign and two sons, Seymour W. Jr., and George G. The family briefly halted in Grand Blanc, MI, where Ensign assisted local Alden Tupper in brick making. The family moved to Saginaw County in the fall of that same year, where they remained pioneers for a period of 10 years. In the spring of 1842, Ensign visited what would become known as Montrose Township and purchased the southwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section 22 from Thomas L. L. Brent of nearby Flushing. During that year he and his family resided upon the Brent farm, in Flushing, while erecting a small frame house on their 40-acre purchase. In the spring of 1843 they became the first white residents in the township. Today, the approximate location of the Ensign homestead is the northeast corner of McKinley and Wilson roads. The Ensign family was followed later that same year by settlers George Wilcox, from Canada and Richard Travis, from Oxford, Oakland County, MI. Both men settled relatively near by, with Mr. Wilcox on the east half of the southwest quarter of section 23 and Mr. Travis on the east half of the southeast quarter of section 23. The assessment roll of shows that the only tax-paying residents in this township in 1844 were Ensign, Wilcox and Travis.

Both Thetford post offices were closed on August 30, 1902. Rogersville was discontinued on August 30, 1919. =Modern era= In 2001, the township began a police department by funding it from the general fund budget. The township board hired a part-time police Chief Thomas Kulcher at the time. Kulcher went on medical leave then resigned in 2007. A temporary police administrator was hired in Vienna Township Supervisor Anthony McKerchie, who then hired two part-time officers. A 1 mill levy to increase department staff was placed on the November 2007 ballot only to increase anti-police department sentiment and the levy failed at the ballot. In December 2008, McKerchie resigned. At a March 2008 board meeting, some residents called on the trustees to close the police department given the township was facing a $100-thousand deficit for the budget that was up for approval and greater presents of sheriff's deputies and State Police troopers. On Monday November 27, 2017, the northern loop set of municipalities, including Thetford, began receiving water from the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline and treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division. In 2008, the township police department started participating in the Defense Logistics Agency's Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) surplus equipment program. By 2015, the department had received through the program 450 valued at more than $1.1 million. Township Trustee Stan Piechnik and Thetford Township Supervisor Gary Stevens requested an inventory and storage location. This was also augmented by an audit that indicated that this equipment should be accounted for in an inventory. Per Piechnik and Stevens Police Chief Robert Kenny had not aided in this effort such that the duo started looking for the equipment themselves as Piechnik claims that the surplus equipment were being delivery to friends of Kenny. After assuming they had permission in May 2017 to be on private property to look for the equipment, the duo were given a citation by Kenny for trespassing. Kenny also handled the investigation, but the charges where dismissed by the township attorney. LESO contacted the township to indicate an investigation was ongoing into the township's participation. Stevens then requested the Genesee County Sheriff to investigate. By December 24, 2017, a group of residents included Eugene Lehr, who was storing 20 LESO items on his property, had filed language for recall petitions for Piechnik and Stevens with language clarity hearing set for December 27. The weekend after a township board on April 16, 2018 that had an heated exchange between Lehr and Stevens, equipment began showing up at the township offices. On April 26, 2018, the Sheriff's Office conducted a warranted search of the police department. On May 7, 2018, an employee and father of the township clerk quit causing a dispute such that the township offices were close soon after opening. In June 2018, an envelope with $4,700 was found with the LESO equipment being moved, so the conduct of the chief was placed on its late June meeting. With Kenny unable to attend, a special meeting was called for July 2, 2018. With only three board members attending, the special meeting was canceled. One of the special meeting attendees then confronted and threatened Stevens the next day at the township offices. July 10 was the deadline for the recall petitions with no word if any were turned in the county clerk-register office. Steven planned to call another special meeting the week of July 16, 2018. While no additional special meeting was called, the board voted at the late July meeting to place a proposal on the ballot whether or not the township resident want their own police department. With the need to hold hearings and approve the ballot language, the township attorney advised them they did not have enough time and discontinue the effort. Kenny was then arrested on August 22 on two five year charges, embezzlement and obstruction of justice, and arranged the next day. A special meeting was called for August 24 to decide if to place him on leave.

However, Captain N. D. Moore is credited with disclosing the ore which led to the development of the Colby property. Mining began in 1883. By 1884, the Milwaukee Lake Shore and Western Railroad (later the Chicago and Northwestern) was being built from Antigo, WI to Ashland, WI by way of the new mines. The railroad company platted the town of Bessemer in 1884. On June 4, 1886 Gogebic County was separated from Ontonagon County. In March 1887, 360 voting members assembled and voted to organize the village of Bessemer. In the same year Gogebic County was officially created by the Michigan Legislature. Also in the year Bessemer and Ironwood called an election to see which city would be the county seat and also have the Gogebic County Courthouse. Ironwood men traveling to Bessemer to vote were made drunk and the train did not stop at the voting site. Ironwood lost and Bessemer gained the county seat. From 1884 to December 31, 1958, a period of seventy-five years, the iron ore shipment from all of Gogebic County totaled over 245 million tons. In 1966 the last mine in Bessemer, the Peterson Mine, closed. Many left the area to work in car factories in Kenosha, and the local economy underwent a serious decline. Bessemer is named for Sir Henry Bessemer (1813-1898), English inventor of steel manufacturing.  Government  Bessemer is operated by an elected 5-member city council with day-to-day operations run by an appointed city manager.

It is the westernmost city in Michigan, situated on the same line of longitude (90.2 degrees West) as Clinton, Iowa and St. Louis, Missouri. The population was 5,387 at the 2010 census. While originally an iron mining town, the area is now known for its downhill skiing resorts, including Big Powderhorn, Blackjack, Indianhead, Mount Zion and Whitecap as well as its cross country skiing at the Wolverine Nordic Trail System and the ABR Nordic Center. The city is at the south end of Ironwood Township, but is administratively autonomous. Ironwood is home of the \\"World's Tallest Indian,\\" a fiberglass statue of tribal leader Hiawatha. History Ironwood was settled in the spring of 1885. The town was incorporated as a village in 1887 and as a city on April 8, 1889. The township area north of the city was incorporated as Ironwood Township on April 8, 1889. In 1890 the population of Ironwood passed 7500 and in 1900 it reached 10000.Ironwood, Michigan. The Growing Years 1885‚Äì1925. The Centennial edition, 1985. Ironwood reputedly acquired its name when Frederic W. Rhinelander, president of the Milwaukee Lake Shore and Western Railroad line, arriving by train at what was then little more than a wilderness camp, chose it to honor one of his employees, mining captain James (Iron) Wood. Ironwood is located within the now inactive Gogebic Iron Range. Iron ore was found in the area in the 1870s. The arrival of the railroad in the mid-1880s gave an impetus to more extensive development of the area's ore deposits. Several mines, such as the Norrie, Aurora, Ashland, Newport, and Pabst, were opened in Ironwood. The mines and the lumber works attracted newcomers from other parts of the US and from European countries such as England, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Sweden. On September 17, 1887, a disastrous fire swept over half the business area, although the buildings that were lost were quickly rebuilt. In 1926, the Pabst Mine Disaster occurred, killing three electricians and trapping forty-three miners for up to five days. By the early 1890s twelve churches had been established in Ironwood by the various immigrant communities: * The Methodist Episcopal Church * The Jessieville Methodist Episcopal Church * St Ambrose Church (Catholic) * St Michael's Church (Catholic) * First Swedish Baptist Church * Swedish Methodist Episcopal Church * Swedish Mission Church (Covenant Church) * Swedish Lutheran Church * First Finnish Lutheran Church * The First Presbyterian Church * St Pauls Episcopal Church * The First Apostolic Lutheran Church In the early 1960s, the U.S. Air Force established a Strategic Air Command (SAC) Radar Bomb Scoring site atop Norrie hill to track and score high altitude and treetop level simulated bomb runs by B-52s and B-47s on targets in the Ironwood area. A monument is erected south of Hurley, Wisconsin to remember those crew members killed in two B-47 low level runs. The site was moved to Charlevoix, Michigan in the mid-1960s. Culture Ironwood boasts two theatrical venues: Theatre North, dedicated to live community productions; and the Ironwood Theatre, which features local, regional and national acts, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Two dance companies, the Bethany Ann Hellen Studios and Ironwood Dance Company, produce shows throughout the year and send dancers to compete at state and national competitions. The Ironwood Carnegie Library is the oldest operating Carnegie library in the state of Michigan. Each summer the Pine Mountain Music Festival brings top performances to Ironwood. Literature Ironwood and its famous pasties appear in Neil Gaiman's novel American Gods. Ironwood and the Ironwood region are central to folk novel Marvin & Me, by author and Ironwood native Rod Stockhaus. Raymond Luczak‚Äôs Compassion, Michigan: The Ironwood Stories was inspired by Ironwood‚Äôs 130-year history. Government Memorial Building is on the National Register of Historic Places Ironwood's city government, like many other small Michigan communities, consists of a five-member city council with the recipient of the most votes among the five serving as Mayor. Day-to-day operations are the responsibility of the City Manager, who reports directly to the council during their two monthly, public meetings. =Public protection= The City of Ironwood operates a public safety department, in which all of the members are fully cross-trained and serve as both police officers and firefighters. Current city ordinances allow for a full-time staff of around twelve. Before 1989, the city had traditional, separate police and fire departments. IPSD, as the department is now known, continues to be the only full-time fire department in the Western Upper Peninsula. The Public Safety Department is also supplemented by the volunteer fire department which has been in operation since 1887. In response to a decade-long rise in tourism, the department now operates a snowmobile patrol unit from December to February, and a community-based foot patrol unit from May to September.

It is the largest city in the region of Oldambt in the province of Groningen which has 38,213 inhabitants. Winschoten received its city rights in 1825. It was a separate municipality until it was merged into Oldambt in 2010. The seat of government of Oldambt is in Winschoten. There are three windmills and several churches in Winschoten. There is a railway station with direct connections to Groningen and Leer (Germany). Winschoten has an important role as a shopping centre for the region of Oldambt. In the province of Groningen, it is the second-largest shopping destination and it attracts many consumers from nearby Germany.  Etymology  Church and tower Winschoten City hall Winschoten Windmill 'Edens' in Winschoten Pedestrian shopping street: Langestraat Posttil retailcentre in Winschoten The origin of the name of Winschoten is not known but it has received nicknames. One of these is Molenstad (or Milltown). It has also been known, in living memory, as Sodom. This name arose out of the Jewish community who were scandalised by the immoral behaviour of their Gentile neighbours. The inhabitants are also called Tellerlikkers (plate lickers).  History  Geography Winschoten was the capital of the Oldambt district, in a fertile agricultural region. Winschoten received city rights in 1825. It was the last town in the Netherlands to be granted such rights and it was more of a symbolic gesture. The town flag has three horizontal stripes of blue and white, in ratio 1:3:1, on the white stripe is a red outline plan of a fortress with nine embattlements. It was adopted 23 May 1973 by municipal resolution. The coat of arms is an image of Saint Vitus, whose name can also be recognized in many streetnames, schoolnames names of clubs, etc. Winschoten is located at (53.15, 7.03) in the municipality of Oldambt, in the east of the province of Groningen, and in the northeast of the Netherlands. It is situated east of Groningen, Hoogezand, and Veendam, north of Stadskanaal, south of Delfzijl, and west of Leer and Papenburg (both in Germany). It is also south of the Dollart and the Oldambtmeer. File:Netherlands, Winschoten, map, around 1865-1870.jpgThe municipality around 1870 File:Winschoten-plaats- OpenTopo.jpgTopographic map of Winschoten, June 2014 Windmills There used to be 13 mills in Winschoten, today only three large, monumental windmills remain in the town. These mills are now owned by the local council and are run by volunteer millers. They form an important feature of the townscape and are well cared for by the local authorities for the benefit of the community and visitors. Molen Berg, built in 1854 at the Grintweg, was designed to grind corn. Its first owner was J.D. Buurma. The unusual design of the sails with movable blades, akin to venetian blinds was in advance for its time. Traditionally Dutch windmills have tarpaulin covering the sails to control or catch the wind's power. The Dijkstra Molen in the Nassaustraat was built in 1862 by D.E. Dijkstra. In 1953 the original owner's grandson sold it to the local government. It was restored 1982/1983 and further restoration work took place in 1995/-6 restoration. Molen Edens, at Nassaustraat 14, was built in 1763 on the instructions of Jurrien Balles and Antje Gerbrands. Later owners were Jan Joesten and G. Eikema. Then from 1855 till 1960 various generations of the Edens family owned it. The local municipality bought it in 1960. It is the oldest mill in the entire province of Groningen. Churches There are numerous Protestant churches in Winschoten including an assembly of Plymouth Brethren. The oldest church dates back to the 13th century in style mingling Roman and Gothic features. There is a Dutch Reformed church on Marktplein. A free-standing 16th-century bell tower is one of the features of the Winschoten skyline. There is a Roman Catholic church dedicated to Saint Vitus, built by Alfred Tepe in 1880. It is a neo-gothic church with stained glass windows by Kocken and a sandstone highaltar from Freitag in M√ºnster. This altar was formerly placed in the Saint Boniface church in Nieuwe Pekela. When this church was demolished it was brought to Winschoten to replace an old altar. There used to be a thriving Jewish community. In 1940 Winschoten had the second largest Jewish community in The Netherlands after Amsterdam. During the Second World War, Winschoten was a transit port to Germany for the Jew- transports. Of the 493 Jews that lived in Winschoten at the beginning of the war, only 20 survived. Monuments The name tellerlikker (mentioned above) was given on account of the local custom to voraciously devour their meals and conclude with licking the plate (teller - in the local dialect) clean. A monument to one of these plate lickers stands on the Oldambt Square, in front of an area where the theatre 'De Klinker', built on the site of a former brick factory, used to be. A dog in turn licks the feet of his greedy owner. Language The official language is Dutch, but many Winschoters especially of older generations speak the local dialect called Gronings. In addition, many inhabitants are able to speak German or English. The Winschoter version of the dialect Gronings has influences of Hebrew and Yiddish as a consequence of the once prominent Jewish community that had lived there since the 18th century. Sports Winschoten is host to the oldest Ultramarathon of the Netherlands since 1976 called De RUN. It is a race of run individually over a paved lap through the town. The current record of 06:16:41 is held by Jean- Paul Praet since 1992. During the event, that is usually held on the second Saturday of September, there is also the possibility to run a race or to compete with a group in a 10x10 km relay race. Winschoten also hosted the start and finish of the first stage at the 2013 Energiewacht Tour.  Transportation  Winschoten railway station in 2006 Winschoten has a railway station with train services towards Groningen and Leer (in Germany). The railway station was inaugurated 1 May 1868 to service the Groningen‚ÄìWinschoten‚ÄìNieuweschans line. This was the second brought into use by the Company for the Exploitation of State Railways (Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen) and part of the Harlingen‚ÄìNieuweschans railway (built 1863‚Äì1868). Today this route is operated by Arriva. Winschoten also has a road connection to the rest of the Netherlands and Germany via the A7 motorway (E22).

The microscope has a digital camera which is connected to a computer. The optical microscope, also referred to as a light microscope, is a type of microscope that commonly uses visible light and a system of lenses to generate magnified images of small objects. Optical microscopes are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century. Basic optical microscopes can be very simple, although many complex designs aim to improve resolution and sample contrast. The object is placed on a stage and may be directly viewed through one or two eyepieces on the microscope. In high-power microscopes, both eyepieces typically show the same image, but with a stereo microscope, slightly different images are used to create a 3-D effect. A camera is typically used to capture the image (micrograph). The sample can be lit in a variety of ways. Transparent objects can be lit from below and solid objects can be lit with light coming through (bright field) or around (dark field) the objective lens. Polarised light may be used to determine crystal orientation of metallic objects. Phase-contrast imaging can be used to increase image contrast by highlighting small details of differing refractive index. A range of objective lenses with different magnification are usually provided mounted on a turret, allowing them to be rotated into place and providing an ability to zoom-in. The maximum magnification power of optical microscopes is typically limited to around 1000x because of the limited resolving power of visible light. The magnification of a compound optical microscope is the product of the magnification of the eyepiece (say 10x) and the objective lens (say 100x), to give a total magnification of 1,000√ó. Modified environments such as the use of oil or ultraviolet light can increase the magnification. Alternatives to optical microscopy which do not use visible light include scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy and as a result, can achieve much greater magnifications. Types Diagram of a simple microscope There are two basic types of optical microscopes: simple microscopes and compound microscopes. A simple microscope uses the optical power of single lens or group of lenses for magnification. A compound microscope uses a system of lenses (one set enlarging the image produced by another) to achieve much higher magnification of an object. The vast majority of modern research microscopes are compound microscopes while some cheaper commercial digital microscopes are simple single lens microscopes. Compound microscopes can be further divided into a variety of other types of microscopes which differ in their optical configurations, cost, and intended purposes. =Simple microscope= A simple microscope uses a lens or set of lenses to enlarge an object through angular magnification alone, giving the viewer an erect enlarged virtual image. The use of a single convex lens or groups of lenses are found in simple magnification devices such as the magnifying glass, loupes, and eyepieces for telescopes and microscopes. =Compound microscope= Diagram of a compound microscope A compound microscope uses a lens close to the object being viewed to collect light (called the objective lens) which focuses a real image of the object inside the microscope (image 1). That image is then magnified by a second lens or group of lenses (called the eyepiece) that gives the viewer an enlarged inverted virtual image of the object (image 2). The use of a compound objective/eyepiece combination allows for much higher magnification. Common compound microscopes often feature exchangeable objective lenses, allowing the user to quickly adjust the magnification. A compound microscope also enables more advanced illumination setups, such as phase contrast. =Other microscope variants= There are many variants of the compound optical microscope design for specialized purposes. Some of these are physical design differences allowing specialization for certain purposes: * Stereo microscope, a low- powered microscope which provides a stereoscopic view of the sample, commonly used for dissection. * Comparison microscope, which has two separate light paths allowing direct comparison of two samples via one image in each eye. * Inverted microscope, for studying samples from below; useful for cell cultures in liquid, or for metallography. * Fiber optic connector inspection microscope, designed for connector end-face inspection * Traveling microscope, for studying samples of high optical resolution. Other microscope variants are designed for different illumination techniques: * Petrographic microscope, whose design usually includes a polarizing filter, rotating stage and gypsum plate to facilitate the study of minerals or other crystalline materials whose optical properties can vary with orientation. * Polarizing microscope, similar to the petrographic microscope. * Phase-contrast microscope, which applies the phase contrast illumination method. * Epifluorescence microscope, designed for analysis of samples which include fluorophores. * Confocal microscope, a widely used variant of epifluorescent illumination which uses a scanning laser to illuminate a sample for fluorescence. *Two-photon microscope, used to image fluorescence deeper in scattering media and reduce photobleaching, especially in living samples. * Student microscope ‚Äì an often low-power microscope with simplified controls and sometimes low quality optics designed for school use or as a starter instrument for children. * Ultramicroscope, an adapted light microscope that uses light scattering to allow viewing of tiny particles whose diameter is below or near the wavelength of visible light (around 500 nanometers); mostly obsolete since the advent of electron microscopes *Tip- enhanced Raman microscope, is a variant of optical microscope based on tip- enhanced Raman spectroscopy, without traditional wavelength-based resolution limits. This microscope primarily realized on the scanning-probe microscope platforms using all optical tools. =Digital microscope= A miniature USB microscope. A digital microscope is a microscope equipped with a digital camera allowing observation of a sample via a computer. Microscopes can also be partly or wholly computer-controlled with various levels of automation. Digital microscopy allows greater analysis of a microscope image, for example measurements of distances and areas and quantitaton of a fluorescent or histological stain. Low-powered digital microscopes, USB microscopes, are also commercially available. These are essentially webcams with a high-powered macro lens and generally do not use transillumination. The camera attached directly to the USB port of a computer, so that the images are shown directly on the monitor. They offer modest magnifications (up to about 200√ó) without the need to use eyepieces, and at very low cost. High power illumination is usually provided by an LED source or sources adjacent to the camera lens. Digital microscopy with very low light levels to avoid damage to vulnerable biological samples is available using sensitive photon-counting digital cameras. It has been demonstrated that a light source providing pairs of entangled photons may minimize the risk of damage to the most light-sensitive samples. In this application of ghost imaging to photon-sparse microscopy, the sample is illuminated with infrared photons, each of which is spatially correlated with an entangled partner in the visible band for efficient imaging by a photon-counting camera. History =Invention= The earliest microscopes were single lens magnifying glasses with limited magnification which date at least as far back as the widespread use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century.Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554 Compound microscopes first appeared in Europe around 1620William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, pp. 391‚Äì392 including one demonstrated by Cornelis Drebbel in London (around 1621) and one exhibited in Rome in 1624.Raymond J. Seeger, Men of Physics: Galileo Galilei, His Life and His Works, Elsevier - 2016, page 24J. William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 The actual inventor of the compound microscope is unknown although many claims have been made over the years. These include a claim 35 years after they appeared by Dutch spectacle- maker Johannes Zachariassen that his father, Zacharias Janssen, invented the compound microscope and/or the telescope as early as 1590. Johannes' (some claim dubious)Van Helden, p. 43Shmaefsky, Brian (2006) Biotechnology 101. Greenwood. p. 171. .Note: stories vary, including Zacharias Janssen had the help of his father Hans Martens (or sometimes said to have been built entirely by his father). Zacharias' probable birth date of 1585 (Van Helden, p. 28) makes it unlikely he invented it in 1590 and the claim of invention is based on the testimony of Zacharias Janssen's son, Johannes Zachariassen, who may have fabricated the whole story (Van Helden, p. 43). testimony pushes the invention date so far back that Zacharias would have been a child at the time, leading to speculation that, for Johannes' claim to be true, the compound microscope would have to have been invented by Johannes' grandfather, Hans Martens.Brian Shmaefsky, Biotechnology 101 - 2006, page 171 Another claim is that Janssen's competitor, Hans Lippershey (who applied for the first telescope patent in 1608) also invented the compound microscope. Other historians point to the Dutch innovator Cornelis Drebbel with his 1621 compound microscope. Galileo Galilei is also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor. After 1610, he found that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects, such as flies, close upRobert D. Huerta, Giants of Delft: Johannes Vermeer and the Natural Philosophers : the Parallel Search for Knowledge During the Age of Discovery, Bucknell University Press - 2003, page 126 and/or could look through the wrong end in reverse to magnify small objects.A. Mark Smith, From Sight to Light: The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics, University of Chicago Press - 2014, page 387 The only drawback was that his 2 foot long telescope had to be extended out to 6 feet to view objects that close.Daniel J. Boorstin, The Discoverers, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group - 2011, page 327 After seeing the compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, Galileo built his own improved version. In 1625, Giovanni Faber coined the name microscope for the compound microscope Galileo submitted to the Accademia dei Lincei in 1624 (Galileo had called it the \\"occhiolino\\" or \\"little eye\\"). Faber coined the name from the Greek words ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœåŒΩ (micron) meaning \\"small\\", and œÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒµ·øñŒΩ (skopein) meaning \\"to look at\\", a name meant to be analogous with \\"telescope\\", another word coined by the Linceans.\\"Il microscopio di Galileo\\" , Instituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza (in Italian) Christiaan Huygens, another Dutchman, developed a simple 2-lens ocular system in the late 17th century that was achromatically corrected, and therefore a huge step forward in microscope development. The Huygens ocular is still being produced to this day, but suffers from a small field size, and other minor disadvantages. =Popularization= The oldest published image known to have been made with a microscope: bees by Francesco Stelluti, 1630Gould, Stephen Jay (2000) The Lying Stones of Marrakech. Harmony Books. . Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632‚Äì1724) is credited with bringing the microscope to the attention of biologists, even though simple magnifying lenses were already being produced in the 16th century. Van Leeuwenhoek's home-made microscopes were simple microscopes, with a single very small, yet strong lens. They were awkward in use, but enabled van Leeuwenhoek to see detailed images. It took about 150 years of optical development before the compound microscope was able to provide the same quality image as van Leeuwenhoek's simple microscopes, due to difficulties in configuring multiple lenses. In the 1850s, John Leonard Riddell, Professor of Chemistry at Tulane University, invented the first practical binocular microscope while carrying out one of the earliest and most extensive American microscopic investigations of cholera. =Lighting techniques= While basic microscope technology and optics have been available for over 400 years it is much more recently that techniques in sample illumination were developed to generate the high quality images seen today. In August 1893, August K√∂hler developed K√∂hler illumination. This method of sample illumination gives rise to extremely even lighting and overcomes many limitations of older techniques of sample illumination. Before development of K√∂hler illumination the image of the light source, for example a lightbulb filament, was always visible in the image of the sample. The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in 1953 for his development of phase contrast illumination which allows imaging of transparent samples. By using interference rather than absorption of light, extremely transparent samples, such as live mammalian cells, can be imaged without having to use staining techniques. Just two years later, in 1955, Georges Nomarski published the theory for differential interference contrast microscopy, another interference-based imaging technique. =Fluorescence microscopy= Modern biological microscopy depends heavily on the development of fluorescent probes for specific structures within a cell. In contrast to normal transilluminated light microscopy, in fluorescence microscopy the sample is illuminated through the objective lens with a narrow set of wavelengths of light. This light interacts with fluorophores in the sample which then emit light of a longer wavelength. It is this emitted light which makes up the image. Since the mid-20th century chemical fluorescent stains, such as DAPI which binds to DNA, have been used to label specific structures within the cell. More recent developments include immunofluorescence, which uses fluorescently labelled antibodies to recognise specific proteins within a sample, and fluorescent proteins like GFP which a live cell can express making it fluorescent. Components Basic optical transmission microscope elements (1990s) All modern optical microscopes designed for viewing samples by transmitted light share the same basic components of the light path. In addition, the vast majority of microscopes have the same 'structural' componentsHow to Use a Compound Microscope . microscope.com (numbered below according to the image on the right): * Eyepiece (ocular lens) (1) * Objective turret, revolver, or revolving nose piece (to hold multiple objective lenses) (2) * Objective lenses (3) * Focus knobs (to move the stage)  Coarse adjustment (4)  Fine adjustment (5) * Stage (to hold the specimen) (6) * Light source (a light or a mirror) (7) * Diaphragm and condenser (8) * Mechanical stage (9) =Eyepiece (ocular lens)= The eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a cylinder containing two or more lenses; its function is to bring the image into focus for the eye. The eyepiece is inserted into the top end of the body tube. Eyepieces are interchangeable and many different eyepieces can be inserted with different degrees of magnification. Typical magnification values for eyepieces include 5√ó, 10√ó (the most common), 15√ó and 20√ó. In some high performance microscopes, the optical configuration of the objective lens and eyepiece are matched to give the best possible optical performance. This occurs most commonly with apochromatic objectives. =Objective turret (revolver or revolving nose piece)= Objective turret, revolver, or revolving nose piece is the part that holds the set of objective lenses. It allows the user to switch between objective lenses. =Objective lens= At the lower end of a typical compound optical microscope, there are one or more objective lenses that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a cylinder housing containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three objective lenses screwed into a circular nose piece which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5√ó to 100√ó while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2 mm, respectively. Objective lenses with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image. Some high performance objective lenses may require matched eyepieces to deliver the best optical performance. Oil immersion objective Two Leica oil immersion microscope objective lenses: 100√ó (left) and 40√ó (right) Some microscopes make use of oil-immersion objectives or water-immersion objectives for greater resolution at high magnification. These are used with index-matching material such as immersion oil or water and a matched cover slip between the objective lens and the sample. The refractive index of the index-matching material is higher than air allowing the objective lens to have a larger numerical aperture (greater than 1) so that the light is transmitted from the specimen to the outer face of the objective lens with minimal refraction. Numerical apertures as high as 1.6 can be achieved. The larger numerical aperture allows collection of more light making detailed observation of smaller details possible. An oil immersion lens usually has a magnification of 40 to 100√ó. =Focus knobs= Adjustment knobs move the stage up and down with separate adjustment for coarse and fine focusing. The same controls enable the microscope to adjust to specimens of different thickness. In older designs of microscopes, the focus adjustment wheels move the microscope tube up or down relative to the stand and had a fixed stage. =Frame= The whole of the optical assembly is traditionally attached to a rigid arm, which in turn is attached to a robust U-shaped foot to provide the necessary rigidity. The arm angle may be adjustable to allow the viewing angle to be adjusted. The frame provides a mounting point for various microscope controls. Normally this will include controls for focusing, typically a large knurled wheel to adjust coarse focus, together with a smaller knurled wheel to control fine focus. Other features may be lamp controls and/or controls for adjusting the condenser. =Stage= The stage is a platform below the objective lens which supports the specimen being viewed. In the center of the stage is a hole through which light passes to illuminate the specimen. The stage usually has arms to hold slides (rectangular glass plates with typical dimensions of 25√ó75 mm, on which the specimen is mounted). At magnifications higher than 100√ó moving a slide by hand is not practical. A mechanical stage, typical of medium and higher priced microscopes, allows tiny movements of the slide via control knobs that reposition the sample/slide as desired. If a microscope did not originally have a mechanical stage it may be possible to add one. All stages move up and down for focus. With a mechanical stage slides move on two horizontal axes for positioning the specimen to examine specimen details. Focusing starts at lower magnification in order to center the specimen by the user on the stage. Moving to a higher magnification requires the stage to be moved higher vertically for re-focus at the higher magnification and may also require slight horizontal specimen position adjustment. Horizontal specimen position adjustments are the reason for having a mechanical stage. Due to the difficulty in preparing specimens and mounting them on slides, for children it's best to begin with prepared slides that are centered and focus easily regardless of the focus level used. =Light source= Many sources of light can be used. At its simplest, daylight is directed via a mirror. Most microscopes, however, have their own adjustable and controllable light source ‚Äì often a halogen lamp, although illumination using LEDs and lasers are becoming a more common provision. K√∂hler illumination is often provided on more expensive instruments. =Condenser= The condenser is a lens designed to focus light from the illumination source onto the sample. The condenser may also include other features, such as a diaphragm and/or filters, to manage the quality and intensity of the illumination. For illumination techniques like dark field, phase contrast and differential interference contrast microscopy additional optical components must be precisely aligned in the light path. Magnification The actual power or magnification of a compound optical microscope is the product of the powers of the ocular (eyepiece) and the objective lens. The maximum normal magnifications of the ocular and objective are 10√ó and 100√ó respectively, giving a final magnification of 1,000√ó. =Magnification and micrographs= When using a camera to capture a micrograph the effective magnification of the image must take into account the size of the image. This is independent of whether it is on a print from a film negative or displayed digitally on a computer screen. In the case of photographic film cameras the calculation is simple; the final magnification is the product of: the objective lens magnification, the camera optics magnification and the enlargement factor of the film print relative to the negative. A typical value of the enlargement factor is around 5√ó (for the case of 35 mm film and a 15 √ó 10 cm (6 √ó 4 inch) print). In the case of digital cameras the size of the pixels in the CMOS or CCD detector and the size of the pixels on the screen have to be known. The enlargement factor from the detector to the pixels on screen can then be calculated. As with a film camera the final magnification is the product of: the objective lens magnification, the camera optics magnification and the enlargement factor. Operation CBP Office of Field Operations agent checking the authenticity of a travel document at an international airport using a stereo microscope =Illumination techniques= Many techniques are available which modify the light path to generate an improved contrast image from a sample. Major techniques for generating increased contrast from the sample include cross- polarized light, dark field, phase contrast and differential interference contrast illumination. A recent technique (Sarfus) combines cross-polarized light and specific contrast-enhanced slides for the visualization of nanometric samples. File:Paper Micrograph Bright.pngBright field illumination, sample contrast comes from absorbance of light in the sample.

File:Paper Micrograph Dark.pngDark field illumination, sample contrast comes from light scattered by the sample. File:Paper Micrograph Phase.pngPhase contrast illumination, sample contrast comes from interference of different path lengths of light through the sample. =Other techniques= Modern microscopes allow more than just observation of transmitted light image of a sample; there are many techniques which can be used to extract other kinds of data. Most of these require additional equipment in addition to a basic compound microscope. *Reflected light, or incident, illumination (for analysis of surface structures) *Fluorescence microscopy, both: :*Epifluorescence microscopy :*Confocal microscopy *Microspectroscopy (where a UV-visible spectrophotometer is integrated with an optical microscope) *Ultraviolet microscopy *Near-Infrared microscopy *Multiple transmission microscopyN.

Chalmers Dept. Applied Physics. 20 January 2006 Optical microscopy is used for medical diagnosis, the field being termed histopathology when dealing with tissues, or in smear tests on free cells or tissue fragments. In industrial use, binocular microscopes are common. Aside from applications needing true depth perception, the use of dual eyepieces reduces eye strain associated with long workdays at a microscopy station. In certain applications, long-working-distance or long- focus microscopes are beneficial. An item may need to be examined behind a window, or industrial subjects may be a hazard to the objective. Such optics resemble telescopes with close-focus capabilities. Measuring microscopes are used for precision measurement. There are two basic types. One has a reticle graduated to allow measuring distances in the focal plane.Gustaf Ollsson, Reticles, Encyclopedia of Optical Engineering, Vol. 3, CRC, 2003; page 2409. The other (and older) type has simple crosshairs and a micrometer mechanism for moving the subject relative to the microscope.Appendix A, Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society, 1906; page 716. A discussion of Zeiss measuring microscopes. Limitations The diffraction limit set in stone on a monument for Ernst Abbe. At very high magnifications with transmitted light, point objects are seen as fuzzy discs surrounded by diffraction rings. These are called Airy disks. The resolving power of a microscope is taken as the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced Airy disks (or, in other words the ability of the microscope to reveal adjacent structural detail as distinct and separate). It is these impacts of diffraction that limit the ability to resolve fine details. The extent and magnitude of the diffraction patterns are affected by both the wavelength of light (Œª), the refractive materials used to manufacture the objective lens and the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens. There is therefore a finite limit beyond which it is impossible to resolve separate points in the objective field, known as the diffraction limit. Assuming that optical aberrations in the whole optical set- up are negligible, the resolution d, can be stated as: :d = \\\\frac { \\\\lambda } { 2 NA } Usually a wavelength of 550 nm is assumed, which corresponds to green light. With air as the external medium, the highest practical NA is 0.95, and with oil, up to 1.5. In practice the lowest value of d obtainable with conventional lenses is about 200 nm. A new type of lens using multiple scattering of light allowed to improve the resolution to below 100 nm. =Surpassing the resolution limit= Multiple techniques are available for reaching resolutions higher than the transmitted light limit described above. Holographic techniques, as described by Courjon and Bulabois in 1979, are also capable of breaking this resolution limit, although resolution was restricted in their experimental analysis. Using fluorescent samples more techniques are available. Examples include Vertico SMI, near field scanning optical microscopy which uses evanescent waves, and stimulated emission depletion. In 2005, a microscope capable of detecting a single molecule was described as a teaching tool. Despite significant progress in the last decade, techniques for surpassing the diffraction limit remain limited and specialized. While most techniques focus on increases in lateral resolution there are also some techniques which aim to allow analysis of extremely thin samples. For example, sarfus methods place the thin sample on a contrast-enhancing surface and thereby allows to directly visualize films as thin as 0.3 nanometers. On 8 October 2014, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Eric Betzig, William Moerner and Stefan Hell for the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy. Structured illumination SMI SMI (spatially modulated illumination microscopy) is a light optical process of the so-called point spread function (PSF) engineering. These are processes which modify the PSF of a microscope in a suitable manner to either increase the optical resolution, to maximize the precision of distance measurements of fluorescent objects that are small relative to the wavelength of the illuminating light, or to extract other structural parameters in the nanometer range.Cremer, Christoph; Hausmann, Michael; Bradl, Joachim and Schneider, Bernhard \\"Wave field microscope with detection point spread function\\", , priority date 10 July 1997 Localization microscopy SPDMphymod 3D dual color super resolution microscopy with Her2 and Her3 in breast cells, standard dyes: Alexa 488, Alexa 568 LIMON SPDM (spectral precision distance microscopy), the basic localization microscopy technology is a light optical process of fluorescence microscopy which allows position, distance and angle measurements on \\"optically isolated\\" particles (e.g. molecules) well below the theoretical limit of resolution for light microscopy. \\"Optically isolated\\" means that at a given point in time, only a single particle/molecule within a region of a size determined by conventional optical resolution (typically approx. 200‚Äì250 nm diameter) is being registered. This is possible when molecules within such a region all carry different spectral markers (e.g. different colors or other usable differences in the light emission of different particles).Cremer, Christoph; Hausmann, Michael; Bradl, Joachim and Rinke, Bernd \\"Method and devices for measuring distances between object structures\\", priority date 23 December 1996 Many standard fluorescent dyes like GFP, Alexa dyes, Atto dyes, Cy2/Cy3 and fluorescein molecules can be used for localization microscopy, provided certain photo-physical conditions are present. Using this so-called SPDMphymod (physically modifiable fluorophores) technology a single laser wavelength of suitable intensity is sufficient for nanoimaging. 3D super resolution microscopy 3D super resolution microscopy with standard fluorescent dyes can be achieved by combination of localization microscopy for standard fluorescent dyes SPDMphymod and structured illumination SMI. STED Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy image of actin filaments within a cell. Stimulated emission depletion is a simple example of how higher resolution surpassing the diffraction limit is possible, but it has major limitations. STED is a fluorescence microscopy technique which uses a combination of light pulses to induce fluorescence in a small sub-population of fluorescent molecules in a sample. Each molecule produces a diffraction- limited spot of light in the image, and the centre of each of these spots corresponds to the location of the molecule. As the number of fluorescing molecules is low the spots of light are unlikely to overlap and therefore can be placed accurately. This process is then repeated many times to generate the image. Stefan Hell of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry was awarded the 10th German Future Prize in 2006 and Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2014 for his development of the STED microscope and associated methodologies. Alternatives In order to overcome the limitations set by the diffraction limit of visible light other microscopes have been designed which use other waves. *Atomic force microscope (AFM) *Scanning electron microscope (SEM) *Scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM) *Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) *Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) *Ultraviolet microscope *X-ray microscope It is important to note that higher frequency waves have limited interaction with matter, for example soft tissues are relatively transparent to X-rays resulting in distinct sources of contrast and different target applications. The use of electrons and X-rays in place of light allows much higher resolution ‚Äì the wavelength of the radiation is shorter so the diffraction limit is lower. To make the short-wavelength probe non- destructive, the atomic beam imaging system (atomic nanoscope) has been proposed and widely discussed in the literature, but it is not yet competitive with conventional imaging systems. STM and AFM are scanning probe techniques using a small probe which is scanned over the sample surface. Resolution in these cases is limited by the size of the probe; micromachining techniques can produce probes with tip radii of 5‚Äì10 nm. Additionally, methods such as electron or X-ray microscopy use a vacuum or partial vacuum, which limits their use for live and biological samples (with the exception of an environmental scanning electron microscope). The specimen chambers needed for all such instruments also limits sample size, and sample manipulation is more difficult. Color cannot be seen in images made by these methods, so some information is lost. They are however, essential when investigating molecular or atomic effects, such as age hardening in aluminium alloys, or the microstructure of polymers.

History The Long Lake township area was initially settled in 1862 when Ira Chase and his brother-in-law Eliphalet Fillmore traveled from Whitewater township to Grand Traverse County to select land. The next few years saw the gradual influx of families who cleared forested areas to establish farms. An annual cycle of farming in the summer, logging in the winter, and maple sugaring in the spring began. The end of the Civil War brought additional settlers and in November 1866 a group of men petitioned the Board of Supervisors of Grand Traverse County to form \\"Viola\\" township. In January 1867, Long Lake Township was formally organized. The population of the township was 333 in 1870, rising to 434 in 1880. The most notable historical incident in the early 1870s was the probable murder of John Eley, his wife Philopena, and their two daughters in July 1871. The family disappeared and neighbors later discovered blood on the walls of the family's house. A hired hand, William Benton, was the prime suspect, since he claimed to have been sold the Eleys' farm. The case was never solved. In the late 1870s, members of the Society of Friends (Quakers) began to move to the township from Indiana. A smaller number of people from Bohemia also settled in the area. The township's population was 663 persons in 152 households in 1900. Farming continued to be the primary source of income. The rise of the auto industry in the late 1910s to 1920s led many younger people to leave the area to settle in the Detroit and Flint areas of Michigan. Today, many residents of Long Lake township are retirees or commute to work in Traverse City.

History  A replica of the Old Mission for which the peninsula is named.The settlement at Old Mission was the first community founded by Europeans in the Grand Traverse Bay region. It was founded in May, 1839 by Rev. Peter Dougherty and Rev. John Fleming. They had spent the winter on Mackinac Island, and founded a Presbyterian mission at the small Old Mission Harbor, which of course did not yet have that name. At the time of their arrival there were a few Native American residents of a nearly abandoned village at the harbor, and the mission had peaceful relations with those and other native residents in the surrounding area. In June that year Henry Schoolcraft arrived at the mission in a small vessel and helped found a school there. By 1841 there were 5 log buildings as well as several wigwams at the settlement. By 1850 the settlement had grown to a considerable size, and the schooner Arrow was making weekly trips to the mission from Mackinaw City. A pastoral farm scene located on the peninsula.In 1852 Rev. Dougherty decided to move his mission across the west bay along the Leelanau Peninsula to an existing Native American village at the site of modern Omena, Michigan, thus establishing a \\"New Mission.\\" The previous community was therefore already known as the \\"Old Mission\\" in the early 1850s. By the time of the civil war, the Presbyterian organization which funded Dougherty had financial difficulty, and missionary activities were discontinued. Dougherty sold his land there in 1868. The post office at the mission was formally established in 1851 with W. R. Stone as first postmaster. The post office was known at this time as Grand Traverse, being the only official post office in the Grand Traverse Bay region, indeed the only one between Mackinaw City and Croton. By the winter of 1852-3, a community had formed at the head of the bay at the Boardman river, at which a new post office was founded. The U.S. post office in consultation with Mr. A. T. Lay, a founder of Traverse City, decided to rename the post office at Dougherty's settlement to \\"Old Mission\\" and named the post office at the Boardman River \\"Traverse City.\\" The \\"Grand\\" had to be dropped, as \\"Grand Traverse City\\" was too long a name per post office guidelines.Wait, Steven Edwin and Anderson, William S.

The French were early explorers in present-day Michigan. They established fur trading with the historic First Nations and Native American nations. By the 18th century, the Ojibwe were the dominant tribe in present-day Michigan. After the Seven Years' War, France was forced to cede its New France territory to the victorious English, who increased fur trade at Sault Ste. Marie. After the rebellious colonists' victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory changed hands again, being ceded to the new United States. It was not until the mid-19th century that much European-American settlement reached this area. In 1848 missionaries established the Bethany Lutheran Mission to serve local American Indians, mostly Anishinaabe-speaking Ojibwe (also known in the US as Chippewa). Following a Native American path to the mission, the European-American Joseph W. Clapp came to the area in 1853, where he built the first house of present- day St. Louis. Over 150 years later, the Mission still stands near Main Street Bridge across the Pine River.\\"History\\", City of St. Louis Website, accessed 3 Feb 2010 By the late nineteenth century, the discovery of mineral springs made St. Louis a destination for people seeking the health benefits of local mineral-rich water, which had the added feature of magnetizing steel.

It was long occupied by the Potowatomi, an Algonquian- speaking people who were part of a long-term alliance, called the Council of Three Fires, with the Ojibwe and Odawa (Ottawa). A Potowatomi band of about 150 people, led by the chief known as Baw Beese, had a base camp near the large lake in the area. The first European-American settler, Jeremiah Arnold, arrived in 1834 and encountered the band. They helped the early settlers. Arnold erected a cabin and moved in with his wife Percy (Round) Arnold. With the arrival of other settlers, the pioneers erected the first schoolhouse in 1838. The City was established in 1839. In 1840, the US forced out Baw Beese and his people, as well as other Potowatomi in neighboring and more distant areas of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, making them remove to Indian Territory in present-day Kansas. Founded in 1844 as Central Michigan College in Spring Arbor, Hillsdale College relocated to this city in 1853 and changed its name. It was the first American college to prohibit in its charter discrimination based on race, religion or sex, and became an early force for the abolition of slavery. It was the second college in the nation to grant four-year liberal arts degrees to women. The city was chartered in 1869. In 1885 Hillsdale dedicated its first high school building, on what is now West Street. (It is now used as the middle school.) In the late 1800s, Hillsdale became a booming railroad town, served by both freight and passenger trains. The railroad was used by tourists to enjoy cottages and other facilities on Baw Beese Lake, named after the Potowatomi chief. About 20 minutes from downtown, the area was developed as a lake resort by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad. People could avoid dusty travel on unpaved roads by taking the train. At the turn of the 20th century, it began to attract tourists from a wider range of cities, such as Chicago, Toledo, Elkhart and others at what had been known as Archer's Landing. People swam in the lake and could rent two types of canoes.\\"Baw Beese Lake\\", Hillsdale Historical Society After World War II, the construction of interstate highways encouraged use of automobiles, and passenger traffic declined on many lines. Railroads had to restructure and the last passenger train left Hillsdale in 1956. Dozens of fine Victorian homes had been built during the prosperity of the 19th century, many of which are still occupied as private residences, contributing to the city's historic fabric. The 20th century brought additional improvements. In 1908 the city opened its first public library. In 1921 it opened its first hospital and in 1934 Hillsdale Municipal Airport opened.City of Hillsdale history Neighboring communities Nearby communities include: Allen, Bankers, Cambria, Camden, Frontier, Jerome, Jonesville, Litchfield, Montgomery, Moscow, Mosherville, North Adams, Osseo, Pittsford, Prattville, Ransom, Reading, and Waldron.

History Woodbridge Township was formed by act of the Legislature of the state of Michigan approved on January 28, 1840 from a portion of Fayette Township. Its original limits and the place designated for holding the first township meeting, were by that act as follows: \\"All that portion of the county of Hillsdale, designated by the United States survey of townships numbered 7, 8 and fractional township 9 south, of range 3 west, be set off into a separate township, and organized by the name of Woodbridge, and the first township meeting therein shall be held at the house formerly occupied by John McDermaid, in said township.\\" \\"This act shall not in any wise affect the collection of taxes assessed in the county of Hillsdale for the year 1839, or in any township thereof; but the same shall be collected as if the act had not be passed. This act shall take effect, and be in force, on and after the first Monday of April next.\\" The first permanent settlement within the present bounds of Woodbridge Township was made by William Saxton, who came from Raisin Township, Lenawee County, Michigan, and settled on the northeast quarter of Section 12, in the winter of 1834-35. He purchased this 160 acres of land from the United States government in 1834 and during the fall of that same year built a log cabin on this site. He was accompanied by his wife and four young sons: Wallace, James, Stephen and John. In order to reach his land it required him to cut his own road in order for his team of oxen and sled to pass. Prior to his move to Woodbridge Township, Mr. Saxon was a veteran of the Black Hawk War and he later settled in Iowa. The next settler in the township was Jacob Clark, who in December 1836, located upon the north part of Section 13, the present site of the village (unincorporated) of Frontier. This land was purchased from the federal government and he also erected a small log cabin on this site. Accompanying him were his sons, Robert W. and Sylvester, and his daughters Rebecca, Sarah and Eliza. Mr. Clark drove in, and owned, the first span of horses in the township. The current Woodbridge Township Hall was built in 1855 after the Woodbridge Township board voted and approved $250 for the construction of a town hall. They also appropriated $10 to purchase a suitable site located in Section 16 of Woodbridge Township. The building committee eventually selected the building site at the corner of Woodbridge and Montgomery roads, just west, and above the St. Joseph River. The original structure was constructed using popular, or tulip wood and completed in 1856. Approximately twenty years later an addition was built onto the original structure and soon after, in 1890, polling booths and a dividing fence were completed. In 1975 the township clerk responded to an inquiry by the Michigan Township Association, who was attempting to validate the oldest town hall still in operation in the state of Michigan and on November 1, 1975, it was verified that the Woodbridge Township Hall was the oldest operational structure.

The Burbank Sanitary District and later the Burbank Community Advisory Council became identifying local political entities. The second Burbank fire station, sold in the late 1970s, is on the northeast corner of Scott Street and Flagg Avenue.

The population was 1,977 at the 2010 census. The village is mostly surrounded by Calumet Township, with a small portion bordering Schoolcraft Township on the east. The portion of Calumet Township south of Laurium is considered part of the Florida (or Florida Location) unincorporated community. History George Gipp Memorial Until 1895, Laurium was known as \\"Calumet\\" (not to be confused with the present nearby town of Calumet, Michigan, which was known as \\"Red Jacket\\" until it adopted the name Calumet in 1929). In 1895 the legislature changed Calumet's name to Laurium, after the famous mining town in ancient Greece. Laurium is located in the center of the Copper Country, the first major copper mining region in the United States. It was founded as a company town serving the Laurium copper mine, which later became part of the Calumet & Hecla mine. The town was generally home to the wealthier members of Keweenaw society, such as mine owners and captains. Although the mines have long since closed, the town still sports many large houses and mansions built by the wealthy mine owners. Today, many of the houses are participating locations in the Keweenaw National Historical Park. The population in 1900 was 5643, of whom 2286 were foreign-born. Noted 20th-century football player George Gipp (\\"the Gipper\\") was born in Laurium. A small memorial to the football legend is located on the corner of Lake Linden Avenue and Tamarack Street and his grave is in nearby Lake View Cemetery. The Palestra was a noted hockey arena, built in Laurium in 1904. It is thought to have been the first purpose-built indoor hockey venue in the United States. In 1921, the entire arena was moved to Marquette, Michigan, and remained there until being razed in 1974. Laurium Historic District House Streetscape Streetscape Streetscape on Pewabic Street In 2005, the Laurium Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The district is roughly bounded by Calumet Street on the west and south, Stable Street on the north, and North Florida and Isle Royale Streets on the east. This area contains the entire village of Laurium save two areas added in the 1970s.Recognition of Laurium Historic District from the National Park Service Keweenaw National Historical Park, posted May 4, 2006, retrieved 8/24/09 The vast majority of the structures in Laurium were constructed during the 35 years between 1880 and 1915, and the common architectural styles in the village reflect what was popular at the time. Over 90% of the structures in the historic district are residential in nature, and most of those are single-family houses.National Register Nomination form Probably the grandest of these is the Thomas H. Hoatson House (now known as the Laurium Manor Inn), a large Classical Revival style house. The most common houses are more modest in scale and ornamentation, with two-story front-gabled houses of predominantly frame construction being the most common. Five churches and two schools are spread through the community, and most commercial structures are near the intersection of Hecla and Third Streets; this includes the J. Vivian, Jr. and Company Building, which is separately listed on the National Register. These buildings are often constructed of brick and/or sandstone.

Education Port Hope High School's mascot is the Bluestars. Port Hope students in grades 6-12 now get their education in Kinde, as the local school board voted in 2014 to contract educational services from North Huron Schools. Port Hope Schools, which had been in operation since 1925, closed its doors in the spring of 2015. History In 1851, William Stafford, while living in Lexington, bought the first parcel of land in what is now Port Hope, with Reuben Dimond. Later, Stafford and William Southard invested in buying up forty-acre parcels from the government. These parcels had been set aside as pensions for veterans of the War of 1812. Traveling to the area by schooner, Southard was let off at some distance from shore, due to a pending storm. Rowing in a skiff in the wind, he vowed that if he made it to shore, he would name the spot Port Hope. Stafford, along with others, opened up the area to lumbering and by 1858 his company dock was constructed and mills were in operation. The chimney from one of those mills can be seen and is the last standing chimney in Michigan from the lumbering era. Port Hope survived the 1871 fire and was able to return to lumbering, but after the second fire in 1881 the trees were gone, and farming became the focus. Stafford adjusted and built a flour mill, elevator and a new dock. Port Hope was incorporated in 1887, with the railroad coming in 1903. A walking tour brochure, with some of the 11 historic sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is available for visitors.

History Directly west of Sand Beach township lies that of Sigel. It was organized some time prior to 1864 with Watson Robinson as the first supervisor on the records. He took up of land under the homestead act that same year. In the fire of '81 all of his buildings and crops were destroyed. He found himself the morning after the fire without a hat or shoes and practically destitute of clothing of any kind. With his accustomed energy and enterprise he began at once to rebuild and repair as far as possible the damage done by the fire. The first settlers in this township were Fred Jurgess, Joseph Lakowski and Waterhouse Whitelam, who came in 1859. Samuel Williams was another pioneer in this section of the county. In the early lumbering days he had worked for Pack, Woods & Co., at Harbor Beach and later at Port Crescent. He moved on to his farm in Sigel soon after the fire of '71 and by diligence and hard labor transformed this piece of land from the wilderness that it was in 1874 to the modern country home of the present day.

History The land that was to become the township was surveyed by a Musgrove Evans in 1827. James Phillips became the first person to settle in the township in December 1836 at a location known as Alaiedon Center. It was also known as German Settlement because most of its early residents were Germans. In 1837 the first settlement, Jefferson City, was platted and founded at what is today the Hagadorn and Lamb intersection along Mud Creek. The township was formally organized in 1842, and was named by Henry Schoolcraft, who came up with a pseudo-Native American name he claimed meant \\"hill land for excellent living.\\"Alaiedon Township website, \\"History\\" webpage, accessed April 18, 2010 At the time of its organization, the township consisted of what is today Lansing, Meridian, Delhi and Alaiedon townships. The aforementioned townships would be spun off in 1842 to give the township the boundaries it has to this day. The township's settlement pattern changed considerably in 1847, the same year the state capital was moved to Lansing Township. It was found that the town was never formally platted, and thus did not legally exist, preventing the settlement's residents from obtaining deeds to their properties. Subsequently, the town was abandoned and few traces remain of its existence today. In 1877, residents constructed a township hall on one-quarter of an acre of Ingham County's \\"poor farm\\" that served as the township hall until 1959 when a new one was constructed at 2021 West Holt Road.

While the village is in proximity to the state capital and Michigan State University, it has seen little commercial development over its history. The small town's economy is supported primarily by small business, agriculture research and production. History As far as European settlement is concerned, the area that is now the village of Dansville was originally settled by Samuel Crossman in 1844, who, like many settlers at the time, had come from the state of New York in search of a new life. Samuel Crossman's son, Daniel Crossman, officially platted the village in 1857, naming it after himself and the village's first postmaster, Dr. Daniel T. Weston. The settlement was not actually incorporated as a village until 1867. Dansville is one of the earliest settlements in Ingham County. Permanent home-seekers located there as early as 1836-40, and the first business establishment was a small store, with a general stock, opened by Samuel Crossman about 1847. The first hotel was the Union Hotel, built in 1856-7 by David D. Fox. A post office was established in the southern part of Ingham Township in 1846, and was first kept by John B. Lobdell. Later it was moved to Hayne‚Äôs Corners, one and one-half mile south of the present village, and Henry Densmore was postmaster. It finally came to Dansville, where Daniel T. Weston was the first postmaster in 1855. The original plat of the village was laid out May BG, 1857, by Samuel Crossman and Ephraim Hillaird. D. L.

It is a census-designated place (CDP) used for statistical purposes. The population was 19,220 at the 2010 census, up from 11,283 at the 2000 census, when the CDP had one-half the area that it did in 2010. Though it has its own school district and post office (ZIP code 48840), Haslett is administered by Meridian Charter Township as the local government unit. Downtown Haslett is located near the intersection of Haslett and Marsh roads. Haslett is most notable for being the home of Lake Lansing. The lake is in size and features two public parks, allowing access to beaches, fishing, and a boat launch. The Michigan State University Sailing Club and Lansing Sailing Club are located on Lake Lansing. From 1934 until 1974, an amusement park operated near the lake and featured a wooden roller coaster at the site that is now Lake Lansing Park South. In 2007, Business Week ranked Haslett 42nd on their list of \\"Best Places to Raise Your Kids\\". Haslett is named after James and Sarah Haslett, a couple who founded the Nemoka Spiritualist Camp on the shore of Pine Lake (Original name for Lake Lansing). By the later 1800s, thousands of spiritualist descended on Haslett Park for summer meetings, readings, lectures, and seances. Mr. Haslett had hoped to establish his camp as the National Headquarters for the spiritualist movement. His untimely death 1891 and the decline of the spiritualist movement cause his widow to sell the land to the Haslett Park Association in 1898. The new owners transformed the land into a summer recreational destination, and eventually, a figure-8 wooden roller coaster and other carnival rides were added, thus establishing what became known as Lake Lansing Amusement Park. With the railroad established, the Lansing Trolley line added rails so that people could travel from the state Capital, Lansing, to the new recreation center. Holding to this tradition, Haslett is host to Lake Lansing Parks North and South as well as a portion of the Inter-Urban Pathway and numerous other small parks and recreation facilities. The city of Haslet, Texas, is named after Haslett, Michigan (note that the Texas community is spelled with one 't'). The Texas town of Haslet received its name from a railroad worker who relocated to Texas from Michigan in the late 1800s.

As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 8,126. The township consists of five non-contiguous tracts of land: one on the west side of Lansing, three on the east side between Lansing and East Lansing, and one on the southeast side of Lansing. History The first white pioneer to purchase land in the township was Jacob F. Cooley in 1837. The township was organized in 1842 in the northwest corner of Ingham County and was named after the hometown of one of the township's original settlers. The township experienced its first loss of land in 1859 when the unincorporated settlement of Lansing officially incorporated as a city out of seven square miles near the center of the township. Township description The cities of Lansing and East Lansing have incorporated much of the land that formerly constituted the township reducing the township from its original to its current in five disconnected land areas. The western section of the township is the largest, and it includes almost all of the township's industrial developments including the large General Motors Lansing Craft Center and General Motors Lansing Metal Center automobile factories, both of which were closed and shuttered in early 2006. A Superfund site, Adams Plating, is located in this part of the township. Also in the western part are the former Waverly Golf Course and the adjacent Michigan Avenue Park. Formerly owned and operated by the city of Lansing, Michigan Avenue Park included a sledding hill and Little League Baseball field. At the north end of this section of the township north of Saginaw Highway (M-43) lies the residential neighborhood and CDP (census- designated place) of Edgemont Park. The northeastern section of the township is heavily industrialized on its western end (west of Wood Road), but since 2002 this section has become the 'downtown' of Lansing Township with the construction of the Eastwood Towne Center, one of the largest shopping malls in Metropolitan Lansing, and the subsequent creation of the Lansing Township Downtown Development Authority to capture state and national funds for development. The central eastern sections of the township are almost exclusively residential, save for a small strip of land that runs along either side of US-127. The northern portion of these two sections contain the large Groesbeck neighborhood, and the smaller southern portion includes part of the Urbandale neighborhood. The southeastern section of the township is exclusively agricultural in nature, containing experimental farms for Michigan State University.

It is named after the state's first governor, Stevens T. Mason. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 8,252. It is the county seat of Ingham County. Mason is the only city in the U.S. that serves as a county seat ahead of a state capital, with the capital of Lansing also in Ingham County. Despite Mason being the county seat, many county offices and courtrooms are located in Lansing. History In 1836 Charles Noble knew that Michigan would be seeking a central location for a new capital when it became a state. He purchased an area of forest, cleared , and founded Mason Center. The \\"Center\\" was soon dropped. In 1847, however, the state chose Lansing Township northward to be its capital due to its potential for water power. Noble managed to make Mason the county seat instead. Ingham County's first downtown courthouse was built in 1843, and was replaced in 1858, and then again in 1905. In 1865, Mason was incorporated as a village; in 1875 the town became a city. In the 1800s, Mason was the center of Ingham County activity, even more than was Lansing, the state capital. In 1877, Lansing attempted to take the status of county seat for itself, but the two cities made an agreement that moved some county offices and courts to Lansing in exchange for Mason remaining the county seat. As a result, Michigan is the only state in the country with a capital city that is not also a county seat. Up into the early 1900s, the local Ojibwa tribe had a visible presence in the town. In the 1900s, The Wyeth Corporation began producing baby formula in Mason, but that was discontinued in the 1990s. Today, it is home to the headquarters of Dart Container Corporation. Michigan Packaging Company, Lear Corporation, Gestamp Hardtech, and Ingham Intermediate School District also have facilities in the Mason area.

As of the 2010 census the township had a population of 39,688. Meridian Township is the local government unit that includes the unincorporated communities and census-designated places of Okemos and Haslett. Meridian Township is the third largest municipality in the Lansing-East Lansing Metropolitan Statistical Area. Meridian Township takes its name from the fact that the Michigan meridian, the prime north-south survey line, comprises the eastern border of the township. It is from this line that all townships were surveyed and measured.Explanation of the township's seal ‚Äì History Meridian Township was first settled by pioneers in 1836. In November 1836 Obed Marshall purchased of land near present-day Haslett. The earliest settlers located at Pine Lake (now Lake Lansing) and made use of the numerous stands of pines to build their cabin. The lake was later the site of a Spiritualist Meeting Camp led by John Haslett. During the late 19th century, the lake became known as a local vacation area served by an \\"interurban trolley\\" which ran from the City of Lansing to the resort on the south side of the lake. An amusement park was introduced and enjoyed immense popularity into the mid-20th century. Currently, the Village of Haslett is located at the south side of Lake Lansing. The first settlers near the current Village of Okemos (to the south of the former Pine Lake) were Sanford Marsh and his wife who built their cabin in 1839. They were soon followed by Joseph Kilbourne, who took out land for his brother-in-law, Freeman Bray. It was Bray who platted out the southeast corner of his land and sold the lots to newcomers traveling into the mid-state wilderness. The village was first known as Hamilton. > A post-office called Sanford was established in the spring of 1840. Joseph > H. Kilbourne was the first postmaster. A local Native American, Chief John Okemos, was well known throughout the area. The village area was one of his primary camping areas and he traveled frequently between the village and another campsite near present-day Portland, Michigan. In 1857 the Michigan Legislature changed the name of the village officially to Okemos to honor the old chief. The Township is rich with history and one resident, Joseph Kilbourne, had a major role in the decision in 1847 to relocate the state capitol from Detroit to Lansing (then Lansing Township). A local organization, the Friends of Historic Meridian, has an archive of local historic information and also maintains the historic buildings in the Meridian Historical Village.

The city is at the southeast corner of Williamstown Township, but is politically independent. A portion of Williamston was annexed from adjacent Wheatfield Township. Downtown Williamston is located at the intersection of Grand River Avenue (M-43) and Putnam Street (Williamston Road). The population was 3,854 at the 2010 census. Williamston is most notable for its antiques markets, and it has been promoted as a quaint, small town just outside the larger city of Lansing. It recently renovated McCormick Park, which borders the Red Cedar River in downtown Williamston.  History  The location that was later to become Williamston started as the cross-road of the Grand River and Saginaw Indian Trails. It was first occupied by a small band of the Saginaw tribe of the Chippewa People which by the mid-19th century used the area as a 'summer village' (it was not used by them year-round, but they 'wintered' in the area that is now Meridian Township). They used Williamston for planting crops, burying their dead, and holding an annual spring gathering, primarily using the land just north of the Red Cedar River. The area was settled by Europeans in 1834 when Hiram and Joseph Putnam moved briefly to the area from Jackson. They spent less than one full year in the area, planting and then harvesting one crop of oats. Today, inside the city limits, Williamston Road becomes Putnam Street, having been named in their honor. (For many years, several street signs inside the city were misspelled as \\"Putman Street\\", leading to confusion about the correct spelling.) In 1839, the Putnams sold their land to Oswald B., James M., and Horace B. Williams, three brothers from Batavia, New York. James M. \\"Miles\\" Williams, who built a dam, saw mill and later a grist mill in town, eventually platted the land in 1845 and named the town \\"Williamstown\\" after himself. It is unknown how it lost the \\"w\\" in its name. The town was a popular stop on the Grand River trail (that later became a plank road) from Detroit to Lansing in the 19th century. That trail is now Grand River Avenue (M-43) which runs through downtown Williamston. Because the primary means of transportation at that time was the horse and buggy and because the trip from Detroit to Lansing took more than one day, Williamston became a convenient overnight stop. The town was incorporated as a village in 1871, and later as a city on April 1, 1945. A later revised City Charter was adopted by the people effective in April 1963. This charter has been amended several times, but remains in effect today. A history of the area was published for the City's centennial celebration in 1971. It included many photographs and stories of the early city and its inhabitants. There were earlier histories, as well, published in 1880, the 1930s, and in 1963.  Geography  Williamston is located 15 miles east of Lansing, the state capital city of Michigan, and 11 miles east of East Lansing, the home of Michigan State University. The city is located two miles north of I-96, which provides access to Lansing and Detroit. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The Red Cedar River, a tributary of the Grand River, passes just north of the center of town. Lake Lansing is also located in nearby Haslett and is approximately in size. =Climate= This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters.

Economy  Grindstone from the Williams' Mill of the mid-1800s The modern economy is primarily that of a bedroom community. Many residents commute to local, larger towns such as Okemos, East Lansing, or Lansing, where most of the employment is located. The Williamston community was once very reliant on farming as an occupation, however, its prominence in the community has since declined. Although there is no longer much farmland within the city limits, the surrounding area is still devoted to farming. Today, Williamston is well known to the mid-Michigan area for its antiques stores and specialty shops in the downtown area. Williamston is home to two golf courses, The Brookshire Restaurant and Golf Course and Wheatfield Valley Golf Course, as well as a live theatre called Williamston Theatre, and an old-style single screen movie theatre called The Sun Theatre. There is a Williamston branch of the Capital Area District Library, restaurants, a market, grocery store, the Sun Theatre, and numerous smaller clothing stores, boutiques, special interest shops and antique dealers. The Meridian Mall is located in nearby Okemos. The largest employer in the City is the Williamston Community Schools with 170 employees. Habitat for Humanity has a restore and training facility for staff and volunteers. An industrial park opened near I-96, the major corridor between Grand Rapids, Lansing and Detroit. Arts and culture Memorial Day parade A major event in town is the week-long festival known as the Red Cedar Jubilee. It typically begins the last week of June with a children's 'bike parade' through Williamston, and ends with the Boy Scout pancake breakfast on Sunday morning. Events of the Jubilee include a demolition derby, duck race, and chicken barbecue, as well as other events and games for children of all ages. The proceeds from some of the events go to benefit local community groups. One such group, the Lions Club, runs a food and beverage tent during the festival. Artfest on the River, was held in July each year at McCormick Park. The festival however, folded after seven years. The festival was scheduled to return in 2011, but was canceled and instead slated to return in 2012.

The Ingham County Animal Shelter conducts a pet adoption and fundraising drive during the festival. The City of Williamston also sponsored a Labor Day 'Bridge Walk' annually. The former Mayor, Kenneth Zichi, led a group on a brief walking tour of town, pointing out sites of historic interest, and including a 'bridge crossing' of the Red Cedar River. Patterned after the 'Mackinac Bridge Walk' led by Michigan's governor, this was an opportunity to learn a bit more about the history and culture of a small town in Michigan, and enjoy the holiday. On the first Saturday in December, the downtown hosts the annual Light Parade. Activities begin in the afternoon and culminate with a parade of lighted floats and vehicles through downtown Williamston. Afterward, children are given a chance to meet Santa Claus. Typically, stores and street booths sell hot drinks and musicians wander the street during the afternoon and evening. Occasionally, there is an ice sculpture or two spread throughout town.

Providing accommodations for one hundred residents and staff, the Belrockton Dormitory, a Classical Revival-inspired building, was erected at a cost of thirty thousand dollars. Following the closing of the company's silk mills in 1935, the \\"Bel\\" served as a residential training center for the National Youth Administration. In 1943, the building became a recreation center. The city of Belding purchased the structure in 1950 to serve as a community center. In 1987 it became the home of the Belding Museum.

Belding Memorial Library is located at 302 E. Main Street, Belding, Michigan. Belding's first public library was organized in 1890 by a group of civic- minded women who were members of the Ladies Literary Club. A meager collection of books, some from personal libraries and some purchased from funds raised through strawberry festivals, 25¬¢ suppers, and subscription drives, was housed in a room above a store on west Main Street. After the disastrous fire of 1893 swept Main Street, the burned out library was reinstalled in a room over Connell's Drug Store and then later, in an upper room at City Hall. In 1914, upon a suggestion of local businessman Byron Brown, Alvah N. Belding of the Belding & Bros. Company, Silk Manufacturers, decided to build and give a library to the City of Belding. On March 21, 1917, the Belding City Council accepted his offer and agreed to maintain the building in like beauty and form as a library for all time.

The population was 2,018 at the 2010 census. It is located in the southern portion of the county in Odessa Township on the northeast shore of Jordan Lake, which is the boundary with Barry County. Since 1987, Lake Odessa has been named a \\"Tree City USA\\" by the National Arbor Day Foundation. History Several brothers in the Russell family began settling here around 1839 and it became known as the \\"Russell Settlement\\". It later became known as \\"Bonanza\\" and a Post Office with that name was established in 1880. When the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad (later the Pere Marquette Railroad) was built through the area in the 1880s, the village was moved about a mile southwest. At that time the name was changed to \\"Lake Odessa\\", derived from the nearby Jordan Lake and the name of Odessa Township, which had been established in 1846. The township had been named for the city of Odessa in Ukraine, reflecting an interest of one of the founders in Ukraine as well as a desire for a distinctive name. Investor Humphrey Wager purchased of farmland on Jordan Lake and platted the village in 1887. With the advantage of a station on the new railroad, the new village quickly eclipsed the former settlement at Bonanza. The village incorporated in 1889. John R. Waite, a local man with an interest in history, has been credited with significant historical research for the village of Lake Odessa.

History  The township was organized on March 6, 1838 from survey townships 7 and 8 north in range 8 of the Michigan Survey. Township 7 was set off as Keene Township on February 16, 1842. The name was taken from Otisco, New York.History of Ionia County, Michigan. Branch, Elam E., Rev. Indianapolis: B.F. Bowen & Co., 1916. pp. 175-183 The first white settlement in the area was where Dickinson Creek flows into the Flat River northeast of Belding. George W. Dickinson, in company with Thomas Cornell, both of New York, built a saw mill there in 1836. The settlement became known as Dicksonsonville, though when a post office was opened in June 1838, it was named \\"Otisco\\", after the township. Dickinson sold the mill to James M. Kidd in 1845, who platted the village as Kiddville and a post office reopened there with that name in February 1855. The Kiddville Post Office close in June 1894. Cook's Corners was an important early settlement. In 1829, Rufus R. Cook, had led to the area a group of men from New York looking for prospective land for purchase. He returned in 1837 with his family. The post office in Dicksonville was transferred to Cooks Corners in 1839, with Cook as the first postmaster. He built a tavern there in 1846, which proved to be a popular area attraction, and a general store in 1850. The tavern was later a stop on the stage line between Ionia and Greenville. Cook platted the village as Cooks Corners in May 1856. A significant number of German immigrants settled in the southern portion of the township, centered on section 33. A Roman Catholic church was built in 1850 and was replaced by a larger structure in 1872. Although Munson Seely had settled at what is now Smyrna soon after Dickson had arrived, he moved on to Muskegon County a few years later, though his name remains in Seely Creek. After Seely, the next settler there was Calvin Smith in 1843. Soon after, George Dickson, seeking to expand his business, purchased land in the area to build a gristmill at the mouth of the Seely Creek. Dr. Wilbur Fisher arrived in 1848 and arranged to establish a post office there. According to postal regulations, the community was too near to Cooks Corners to have a separate office, but on his application for the office, Fisher had given section 32 as the location, just far enough to qualify for an office (even though it was over a mile away from the community. Fisher chose the name \\"Smyrna\\" for the office, reportedly because he wanted to ensure a unique name. In September 1853, Dickson platted the village as Mount Vernon, after Mount Vernon, Virginia, the home of the first U.S. President, George Washington. The village was also called \\"Mount Vernon Mills\\", but the post office was always Smyrna.

Soon after, he sold parts of the land to Dwight & Hutchinson from Detroit, and together, they founded the village. Proceeding quickly, the proprietors named it Saranac and held a public sale in Detroit. There they sold off many Saranac lots without doing much to ensure the integrity of their original records. Soon after, Dwight & Hutchinson became concerned over the lack of development of the village by the lot-purchasers and gave Cyprian S. Hooker land on which to build a saw mill. Construction began in 1837, but didn't see completion until 1841. Partnering with a furniture maker named Jerry Stocking, the two set out to make their fortunes in the new village. However, they did not find success, and in 1846, the gentlemen gave up and moved away. Other villagers followed suit, convinced the village was doomed. In 1847, a merchant named Ammon Wilson moved in and set up shop on Stocking's former property and later built a warehouse to ship wheat to Grand Rapids, which saw considerable success. The village grew around it; a tavern and a hotel soon followed. In 1851, proprietors of the sold-off lots were allowed to re-dub the township \\"Boston\\", due to an oversight in Dwight & Hutchinson's records and it wouldn't be until 1859 that popular demand would see the name changed back to \\"Saranac\\". Schools, stores, and churches, followed in the subsequent years. In 1857, the first train to reach Saranac rolled through, marking a significant period of growth for the village. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The village is located along the Grand River Valley, within a deep glacial drainage channel and is intersected by the Grand River. The landscape itself is dominated by dense forest, and sprawling, open farmland. The forest is closely associated with the basin of the Grand River and its floodplanes and wetlands. However, wetlands have dwindled over the years, due to drainage and filling in order to improve agricultural opportunities within the region. This is not atypical within the state of Michigan, despite the vast ecological importance that Michigan's wetlands possess. Government Saranac is a general-law village with an elected council consisting of a president, clerk, treasurer, and six trustees.

As of the 2000 census, the township population was 1,202. Sebewa is best known for the historical ‚ÄúBattle of the Four Corners‚Äù in which one local resident, Christopher Harmon, was the only survivor. He went on to become police chief, mayor, and spiritual advisor to nearby residents. Communities * Sebewa (or Sebewa Corners) is an unincorporated community at straddling the boundary between Sebewa Township on the west and Danby Township on the east. On April 11, 1867, Pierce G. Cook, as an agent for Elizabeth Cornell of New Jersey, platted the portion of community in Danby with the name Cornell. Other plats were made on the Sebewa side and over time, the name reverted to Sebewa for the entire settlement.Branch, p. 101 Branch, p. 208 History = Early settlers= The first permanent white settlers in the township were John F. Terrill, Charles W. Ingalls, and John Brown from Vermont, who arrived in 1838. An earlier settler by the name of Jones had arrived in 1836 with his wife, but did not remain in the area. Terrill located on section 25 and Ingall and Brown in section 36. In 1843, Terrill, along with Anson W. Halbert, built a sawmill on the Sebewa Creek, just west of \\"The Corners\\" located where the corners of four sections met along the eastern township line. Halbert had arrived in 1841 and married one of Terrill's daughters and carried out some trade at the Corners.Branch, pp. 203-4 Jacob Showerman had been to the area in 1836 looking for land and found only Jones in section 1. Showerman entered a claim for of land in section 22 and returned in 1839 with Eleazer Brown and their families. They lodged in the small one- room cabin of Terrill's along with Terrill's and that of William Hogle and his son-in-law John Brown. The twenty people in the four families passed four weeks together until a path to Showerman's property could be cut. Eleazer Brown settled on land he bought in section 26.Branch, p. 204 Rufus Goddard, who had moved west from Livingston County, New York, came to the area in 1837 and located land in Sebewa while his family remained in Lenawee County. Goddard, along with Benjamin D. Weld, who was to give some assistance to Goddard, were to come together to Sebewa. However, Weld was not ready to move and both families remained in Lenawee. Weld moved to Sebewa in 1843 and settled in the southwestern part of Sebewa. Goddard followed in 1844 and worked a year and a half to repay Weld before settling on in section 32.Branch pp. 204-205 =Township organization= Sebewa Township was a part of Berlin Township until March 19, 1845, when it was created as a separate township. The first names proposed were \\"Charlestown\\", in honor of Charles W. Ingalls; and \\"Liberia\\", but Rufus Goddard suggested Sebewa, after Sebewa Creek, meaning little river. The first township meeting was held at the home of Jacob Showerman, but no record of the meeting attendees or acts remains.Branch, p. 206 =Post offices= A post office named \\"Sebewa\\" was established on January 24, 1851, with Benjamin Weld as the first postmaster. On April 14, 1854, the post office was moved from Weld's properties in the southwest part of the township to the Showerman settlement when Lucius Showerman was named postmaster. In 1857, the office moved to \\"The Corners\\". The name was changed to \\"Cornell\\" on July 8, 1861 but was changed back to Sebewa on February 16, 1881. The office was closed on November 15, 1913.

The Tawas Point Light is located there. One of the main Winter attractions in the Tawases is known as Perchville USA. When winter freezes Tawas Bay each year, hundreds of perch fisherman move fishing shanties onto the bay's ice, making Perchville USA, the largest non-land community festival in Northeast Michigan. Perchville was created by a Harold Gould, a local druggist. Today it is organized by the local Chamber of Commerce. This celebration was created to draw tourism to the town for ice fishing. Visitors would be able to rent ice shanties, which were set up on the ice in the form of a town. Perchville's annual Chili Cookoff Competition began eighteen years ago, and is still one of the main attractions to this day. One of the most popular events at Perchville is the Polar Bear Swim.

The population was 1,827 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Iosco County. The city is adjacent to Tawas Township but is administratively autonomous. History Tawas City was founded in 1854 as the first city to be located on the shores of Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron north of Bay City, Michigan. Tawas City was designated as the county seat of Iosco County, and the first post office was established Jan. 6, 1856, with James O. Whittemore appointed postmaster. Since Tawas City's founding, the community's economy has been a major factor influencing land use and development patterns. The rich natural resource base of the area: forest lands, Lake Huron and wildlife, combined with the protection offered by Tawas Bay, inspired the founding of the city and provided resources to support a lumber industry. The shoreline, as the transition zone between land and water, became the focus of the community, with the city developing in a linear fashion along the bayshore. Tawas Bay continues to serve as a harbor of refuge, used by large freighters to escape severe storms on Lake Huron. Statements that ‚ÄúTawas‚Äù is derived from the word ‚ÄúOttawas‚Äù and that the Ottawa Indians once inhabited this region are false. The local Indians had made camps along the shore of the bay and near the mouth of the river. They were a band from the Saginaw, Michigan tribe of Chippewa (also known as Ojibwa). Their leader was Chief O-ta-was. As he had his camp on the shores of the bay, it was known as O-ta- was's Bay. Early map makers dropped in an extra ‚Äút\\"; later map makers dropped off the ‚Äús.‚Äù The name of the point dividing the bay from Lake Huron was known as Ottawa Point. Comparatively recent spelling and pronunciation for the name of these Chippewa gradually evolved to Tawas. The Whittemores named the community they founded as Tawas City. Eight years later, the lumbering firm of Smith, Van Valkenburg and Company built a mill on the bay shore a mile or so east of the Whittemore mill and holding. When a community developed around this latter mill, the cluster of homes was, by common consent, named East Tawas. For many years, residents of both towns and the surrounding farming community often referred to Tawas City as ‚Äúold town‚Äù and to East Tawas as ‚Äúeast town.‚Äù Geography *According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. *It is considered to be part of Northern Michigan.

Part of the city (with a population of 8,741) is located within the Isabella Indian Reservation, the base of the federally recognized Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation. The tribe's Soaring Eagle Casino & Resort in nearby Chippewa Township is also within the reservation boundaries.

The student population nearly doubles the population of the city during the academic year, making it a college town. History 1884 map of Mt. Pleasant. Until the mid-19th century, this area was occupied by historical bands of the Ojibwa people, known by English speakers as the Chippewa. In the early decades of the century, they ceded vast amounts of land to the United States government, which wanted to enable settlement by European Americans. The federal Graduation Act of 1854 allowed European-American settlers to purchase land from the government at discount rates, and the first white settlers began to arrive in what became Mount Pleasant. Under the Treaty of 1855, the Ojibwa bands (Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation) from the Saginaw, Swan Creek, and Black rivers were relocated to land in Isabella County (Isabella Indian Reservation).Cumming, John. This Place Mount Pleasant. Mount Pleasant, MI: J. Cumming, 1989. Many non-natives soon moved to Mount Pleasant, predicting prosperous relations with the natives. The Homestead Act of 1862 also attracted many new settlers to Mount Pleasant, including new European immigrants, They worked to develop their stake on free lands offered by the US government in exchange for their labor in developing it for residence and agriculture. The village and future city developed. In 1875, a devastating fire started at the Fancher Building on the north corner of Broadway and Main streets. It moved east down Broadway, destroying several buildings. Seven years later another fire would damage buildings on the south side of Broadway. In 1879 the first library was established in Mt. Pleasant. Known as \\"The Library, Literary, and Musical Association of Mount Pleasant,\\" its first books were made up of the personal book collections of the board members. In 1890, W.A. Jordan started Mount Pleasant Business College. Expanding in 1892, the school changed its name to Central Michigan Normal School and Business Institute, as it incorporated a curriculum of teacher training. It was the origin of what is now Central Michigan University. This is the largest campus of the state system, with 20,000 students in the 21st century. On January 3, 1893, the U.S. government opened an Indian boarding school called the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School. Indian children were encouraged to give up their cultural ways and assimilate to using the English language and adopting European-American culture. The school operated for 40 years, closing in 1933. Since the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the role of such schools has been re-evaluated and the damage done to children by such efforts has been acknowledged. Various Native American groups have taken action to help people reconcile their experiences. On July 17, 2009, the White Bison Wellbriety Journey for Forgiveness made a stop in the Mount Pleasant community to recognize this part of the city's history. The boarding school building was abandoned, but the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation purchased it from the state of Michigan. In 1928, large quantities of oil were discovered in the Mt. Pleasant area. A farm owned by the Lilly family was the first to strike, producing hundreds of barrels a day. Although oil resources eventually diminished, this legacy is represented in the Mt. Pleasant city seal, which includes an image of an oil drill. Mt. Pleasant High School's mascot, the Oiler, also refers to the city's history of oil production.

In 1830, land entries were recorded for William Harris for the southwest quarter of section 17 and Major G. Van Dwyer for the southwest quarter of section 13 (the eastern portion of the section is now part of Galesburg). In 1831 land entries were recorded for Horace H. Comstock, Caleb Eldred, Thomas W. Merrill, Mumford Eldred, Stephen Eldred, Leland Lane, and others. Settling in the eastern part of the township in or near what is now Galesburg were Nathaniel Matthews, Ralph Tuttle, Sherman Cummings, George Townsend, and Nathan Cothren. H. H. Comstock, Caleb Eldred, and Cryus Lovell settled in the western part of the township near what became Comstock. Comstock Township was organized by an act of the Territorial Legislature in 1834. Previously, it was a part of Arcadia Township (later renamed Kalamazoo Township), which initially comprised all eight townships in the northern half of Kalamazoo County.

The 2010 census recorded a population of 1,804. The name is derived from the parchment company that used to manufacture paper on the East bank of the Kalamazoo River. Parchment is located just northeast of the city of Kalamazoo, and is mostly surrounded by Kalamazoo Township. History  The Kalamazoo Vegetable Parchment Company was founded in 1909. The founder, Jacob Kindleberger set up shop along the Kalamazoo River. The company then started selling pieces of land located around the mill to the mill workers. In 1932, \\"Uncle Jake\\" left a tract of 40 acres (160,000 m2) located in the center of the city, this later became Kindleberger Park in his honor. Later in 1939 Parchment became a city by a majority vote, and has become known as \\"The Paper City\\" since then. Over the years the KVP company was bought out by or merged with other companies including, Sutherland Paper Company, Brown Company, James River, and finally Crown-Vantage. 2000 marked the end of paper making in Parchment and the city has struggled to keep itself afloat. Now a great debate in the city exists as to what to do with the old paper mill property. As of 2011 the first mill building has been demolished with plans to demolish the other building at a later date. The mill site came under scrutiny again in July 2018, when the city discovered PFAS contamination in the drinking water. = PFAS Contamination = On July 26, 2018, samples from Parchment's water system showed the drinking water was contaminated with PFAS at a level of 1,587-ppt (Over 20 times the EPA limit). Residents were advised to stop using the water for drinking/cooking immediately, while the city worked to discover the source of the contamination. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a State of Emergency on July 29. The source of the PFAS contamination has not been discovered, but officials believe a former 80-acre landfill along the Kalamazoo River may be the source. The landfill site is also the former home of the paper mill in the city, and the landfill was capped in 2000 after then- owner Crown-Vantage went bankrupt. PFAS have been known to be used in paper- making and associated paper-manufacturing processes. In response, bottled water has been handed out to residents by volunteers, and the City of Kalamazoo is connecting their water system to Parchment. Because of the unknown source of the PFAS, and the associated costs for new wells and testing, Mayor Robert Britigan III predicts that Parchment will have to permanently use Kalamazoo's drinking water. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Parchment is east of the Kalamazoo River. Demographics In the November 2010 gubernatorial election, 588 ballots were cast in the city of Parchment. Schools The city of Parchment has three elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school. Parchment High School was built in 1959 to accommodate the city's growing population. Prior to 1959, Parchment students went through 8th grade and then went to Kalamazoo Central High School. In the mid 1950s Kalamazoo Public school district was considering annexing Parchment into their district. Laurence Tisch, who read water meters for the city started a petition with his wife Jean Tisch to build a new High School. The community was successful in purchasing property and the school was built.

History Richland is located in the middle of what was once the Gull Prairie, an upland area relatively free of trees and maintained by natural and man-made fires. The area had a few Pottawatamie villages, one was located on the west side of nearby Gull Lake. Fish and game were plentiful, and the land was very fertile. Since there were few trees to clear, the prairie was among the first areas of Kalamazoo County to be settled. By the 1830s, the Native Americans had been moved west, and Richland was a thriving frontier village. The village even contended with Prairie Ronde for the county seat, but the centrally-located village of Bronson (now Kalamazoo) was ultimately chosen. Lacking a flowing stream that would have provided water power, Richland never developed significant industry and remained a sleepy farm community until the late twentieth century. In the 1980s and 1990s, small employers such as Richard Allen Medical moved to the edge of town, and Richland became a bedroom community for Kalamazoo. The high quality of the local Gull Lake School District also drew people from surrounding areas. New subdivisions were built in what had been hilly farm country. Brothers Charles S. May and Dwight May, both lieutenant governors of Michigan during the 19th Century, were raised in Richland. Education *Richland Elementary School *Thomas M.

History White settlement in the Schoolcraft area dates to 1828 (nine years before Michigan's admission to the Union), when Bazel Harrison moved his family from Ohio to present-day Prairie Ronde Township, becoming the first settler in the future Kalamazoo County. The village itself was established in 1831 by surveyor (and future statesman) Lucius Lyon, who had first visited the area as a surveyor under government contract in 1823. Recorded on October 5, 1831, Schoolcraft was the first town in Kalamazoo County. Lyon named the village for his friend Henry Schoolcraft. Schoolcraft was a key member of the 1820 Cass Expedition, organized by territorial governor Lewis Cass to explore the Michigan Territory; the expedition played an important role in encouraging settlement of the territory.Swartz (1990), p. 44. Schoolcraft was incorporated as a General Law Village on January 4, 1866. It was reincorporated March 12, 1869 and received its new charter in 1875.Swartz (1990), p. 130-131. Local Historic Sites The Schoolcraft home of Dr. Nathan Thomas served as a \\"station\\" on the Underground Railroad. Dr. Thomas, the first doctor in Kalamazoo County and a Quaker who avidly supported and led abolitionist efforts in Michigan, first built the house in 1835 on the corner of Cass St. and Centre St. Between 1840 and 1860, it is estimated that Dr. Thomas and his wife Pamela Brown Thomas sheltered between 1,000 and 1,500 fugitive slaves on their way to Canada.Swartz (1990), p. 84. Dr. Thomas built a new house in 1868 and the original house was moved to its present site on Cass St. east of U.S. Route 131. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a registered Michigan Historical Site.Nathan M. Thomas House, Michigan historic preservation object. The Schoolcraft United Methodist Church has stood on the corner of Grand Street and Clay Street in Schoolcraft since the early 1850s. The congregation was organized in Prairie Ronde Township in 1832. Its first chapel, called the Ebenezer Episcopal Church of Prairie Ronde, built in 1836, was the first church building of any denomination constructed north of the St. Joseph River.Swartz (1990), p. 85. Cooper's Island is an approximately woodland located about 1/4 mile west of U.S. Route 131 on West Eliza St. Containing a rich and rare assortment of mesic forest plants and trees, the woods are the remnant of the Big Island on Prairie Ronde, an island of forest in the midst of prairie at the time of settlement. Famous as the setting for James Fenimore Cooper's 1848 frontier novel The Oak Openings, Cooper's Island is a listed Michigan Historical Site.Cooper's Island, Michigan historic preservation object. The Schoolcraft Ladies Library (at 163 Hayward St.), built in 1896, is also a state listed site.

A portion of the community is on the west side of the river in Milton Township, Antrim County. History The first permanent white settler in what is now Kalkaska County was William George Copeland, a farmer born in Nottinghamshire, who located there in the fall of 1855, while it was still attached to Grand Traverse County. For the next twelve years, he and his wife were the only permanent white residents of the county. A dam had been built on the Barker Creek about the time Copeland moved there, but a planned mill was never built. The next permanent resident in the township was William H. Bockes, a native of Medina County, Ohio and a Civil War veteran. In June 1866, he purchased land in the township near Barker Creek. After returning to Ohio to marry his wife in October, they both returned immediately to take up residence. Another early resident in the Barker Creek area was John H.F. Letherby, born in England and moved to Canada at the age of 16. He settled in section 32 near Barker Creek in October 1866. The township was organized in 1867. In section 36 in the southeast corner of the township, a few related families originally from Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, made their homes. D.P. Beebe, another Civil War veteran, was the first to arrive in the spring of 1867. Norman Ross, his father-in-law came in the summer of 1867 and became the first township supervisor when it was organized. A.C. Beebe, also a Civil War veteran, came in May 1868. Elisha W. Clement, from Brantford, Ontario settled in section 14 in December 1867. Albert T. Kellogg, from Cortland County, New York, settled in section 14 in September 1868. Kalkaska County remained unorganized and attached to first Grand Traverse County and then Antrim County until an act of the Michigan Legislature of January 27, 1871. Rapid River Township was the first township organized in the county, while it was still attached to Antrim County for administrative purposes. The township was organized in 1868 so that residents in the area would be able to vote in the presidential election without having to travel all the way to Antrim County. At that time, Rapid River Township encompassed several townships that were later separately organized. Clearwater Township was originally organized as \\"Round Lake\\" by an act of the Michigan Legislature on January 18, 1871, and was renamed Clearwater Township in January 1873. A post office with the name of \\"Clear Water\\" had been established in May 1869 and renamed \\"Clearwater\\" in December 1873. There was also a post office at Barker Creek from February 1874 until May 1937. Barker Creek was a station on the Chicago and West Michigan Railway (now the Pere Marquette Railroad).

To the south and east, it is noticeably steeper in elevation, with larger amount of water present in the form of streams, to the north a larger amount of water is present in the form of lakes. The primary constructors of Kalkaska's geographical make-up are ancient glaciers, along with the majority of the entire state of Michigan. Glaciers scoured the surface of Michigan during the Ice Age, creating small hills called drumlins, along with valleys and basins and the water that currently occupies them. This process is called glaciation. Kalkaska experiences a notable amount of snowfall as it is located in a snowbelt that receives heavy amounts of lake effect snow from Lake Michigan.

Major highways  * History U.S. Post Office in Kalkaska The town was platted in 1873 by A. A. Abbott and R. L. Thompson, who owned a sawmill, and who correctly anticipated the arrival of the railroad. On July 5, 1908, a fire began in the middle of the business block and burned most of the stores. Local photographer E. L. Beebe made a number of photographs of the fire, and the resulting postcards were widely sold, and can still be found today. Two years later, in 1910 another fire started in downtown Kalkaska. Again, in 1925 downtown Kalkaska was devastated by the largest fire since the Fire of 1908. In 1916, the noted author Ernest Hemingway visited and fished in Kalkaska, and later immortalized the town in his story \\"The Battler\\". A historical marker has been placed at the Rugg Pond Dam, on the Rapid River, where Hemingway reportedly fished one night from the power house. On July 10, 1951, the Kalkaska State Bank was robbed by an armed man, who fled and later attempted to escape on foot through a nearby swampy area. After three days of what was termed the largest manhunt in Northern Michigan history, involving the FBI and local and state authorities, the gunman was captured south of the town. Named Raymond J. Turcotte, he had a long string of prior convictions, including manslaughter. Turcotte confessed to the bank robbery and served 18 years in the Michigan State Prison in Jackson, including a term for escape in 1961. Discovery of natural gas and oil in the area during the 1970s lead to significant growth for the village; however, the growth has since shifted toward tourism.https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/09/sick-of-being-bypassed- small-us-131-towns-hatch-plan-to-draw-tourists.html%3foutputType=amp In 1993, the Kalkaska schools made national headlines when a financial crisis resulted in a two-month-long closure. Subsequent funding reform improved the outlook for Kalkaska and similar small rural districts in Michigan. In 2014 Walmart announced plans to open a store in Kalkaska.

Starting with a fur trading post of the late 18th century, the township in the late 20th century developed residential and retail areas during suburbanization around Grand Rapids. As of the 2010 census, the township population was 13,142, up from 9,882 at the 2000 census. Ada is the corporate home of Alticor and its subsidiary companies Quixtar and Amway.  Communities  Ada, also known as Ada Village, is an unincorporated community within the township of the same name. It is located on M-21, east of Grand Rapids. European American Rix Robinson built a trading post near present-day Ada in 1821 to trade for furs with the local Native Americans. He made the first land purchase here in 1833, and a settlement developed along the Thornapple River . A post office was established in 1837. Both the township and village settlement were named for Ada Smith, the daughter of the first postmaster. The settlement was given a station on the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad (later part of the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway). A plat was recorded in 1857. =Zip codes= The Ada ZIP code, 49301, serves most of the township, as well as much of eastern Cascade Township to the south, the northwest corner of Lowell Township to the southeast, small areas of western Vergennes Township to the east, the southwest corner of Grattan Township to the northeast, much of southern Cannon Township to the north, and a small area of eastern Grand Rapids Charter Township to the west.49301 5-Digit ZCTA, 493 3-Digit ZCTA - Reference Map - American FactFinder, U.S. Census Bureau, 2000 census In addition to 49301, the Ada ZIP codes 49355, 49356, 49357 are assigned to specific organizations.

This extends south into Cascade Township. The Ada Covered Bridge in the village, which crosses the Thornapple River, dates to the 1860s.  History  The township traces its history to 1821, when Rix Robinson purchased a former French-Canadian trading post at the junction of the Grand and Thornapple rivers from Madeline La Framboise, on behalf of John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company. Land north of the Grand River was not available for purchase by European-American settlers until after the United States signed the 1836 Treaty of Washington with regional tribes. There are conflicting reports concerning when the township was organized. Information provided by the township website indicates that Robinson was elected as the township's first Supervisor. However, other sources indicate it was organized on April 2, 1838, and that Sydney Smith was elected the first Supervisor and that Robinson was the second, elected in 1841 and again in 1844. A village was platted in 1858 at the mouth of the Thornapple River, but it developed slowly and never incorporated. Grand River and hills on the north side of the river The Ada Covered Bridge was constructed across the Thornapple in 1867. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is one of nine covered bridges that remain standing in the state.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.90%, are water. In addition to its two rivers (the Grand and the Thornapple), numerous streams and meadows, Ada Township is known for its lush, rolling, woodland terrain. It had been a rural area that was developed as a wealthy residential suburb of Grand Rapids since the late 20th century. The local school district is Forest Hills Public Schools.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 13,336, up from 12,075 at the 2000 census.  History  The area that would become Cannon Township was originally attached to neighbouring Plainfield Township. In 1837 Andrew Watson brought his family to Cannon and built the first farm in the township. Over the next decade many other pioneers arrived and settled. In 1845 the township was split from Plainfield and took its present name. The state legislature organized Cannon Township as \\"Churchtown\\" in 1846. At the first town meeting, held in 1848, it was renamed \\"Cannon\\", after Cannonsburg, the largest village. The earliest land claims date from 1835. Families began settling permanently in 1839. Zebulon Rood purchased of land in 1840 and built Cannon's first house, a log structure. He also cut the first road, making it possible to transport goods across Bear Creek. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the production of wheat, wool, corn, apples and other fruits supported the economy. This building served as the township hall from 1890 until 1987, when it became the Cannon Historical Museum. The township took its name from the small settlement of Cannonsburgh, which had been founded in 1842 at the direction of LeGrand Cannon, described as an eastern capitalist.Dillenback & Leavitt, History and directory of Kent County, Michigan. Grand Rapids, Mich.: Daily Eagle Steam Printing House, 1870. pp. 43-46. The hamlet had two mills and a store by 1845, and the town was platted to encourage residential growth. LeGrand Cannon was proud of his little town, and provided a fitting gift in appreciation: a small cannon inscribed with his name and date. The cannon was used by the townspeople to commemorate holidays, such as the 4th of July, until someone was hurt firing the ordnance. The cannon was then buried to prevent further injuries, but was later discovered and refitted for firing. Unfortunately, another person was subsequently injured while firing the cannon, and again it was buried, and has not been found again to this day.

History  East Grand Rapids is centered on Reeds Lake. East Grand Rapids was first settled in the early 1830s by the Reed Family from New York, New York. Miss Sophia Reed and Miss Euphemia Davis opened a school in 1834 near Reeds Lake. Close by, in 1835, perhaps one of the first schoolhouses built in the Grand River Valley, was built near Reeds Lake, with Francis Prescott as the teacher. Originally part of Paris Township, South of Hall Street, and Grand Rapids Township, North of Hall Street, residents voted to establish the Village of East Grand Rapids in 1891. The village was incorporated into a Home Rule City in 1926 when the population was approximately 1,300. By the 1870s, the Reeds Lake area was a popular summertime day trip destination for the people of Grand Rapids and surrounding areas. Picnicking, boating, swimming and spending a leisurely day at the lake and park were enjoyable pastimes. The first lakeside pavilion was seen as early as 1879 on the west shore of Reeds Lake. Here viewers could take in a play or listen to a popular orchestra of the day. Originally, those who wished to reach Reeds Lake would do so by foot, stagecoach or by horse and buggy. In the middle 1870s, horse-drawn cars became available. Passengers would board in downtown Grand Rapids, transfer onto the Grand Rapids & Reeds Lake Railway on Sherman Street SE and proceed to the lake down Wealthy Street. By 1877 a steam locomotive replaced the horse cars. Electric streetcars came into use in the early 1890s. Buses replaced them as a mode of transportation in 1935. Interurban also brought residents from nearby cities to Reeds Lake. Ramona Park, an amusement park owned and operated by the Grand Rapids Street Railway Company, was a destination spot for thousands of families between 1897 and 1955. It was very common in those days for a public transportation company to own parks like it. They were known as trolley parks, and were placed at the end of the line to attract or encourage the use of the public transportation system. The Ramona Theatre Pavilion was built in 1897 on the West Side of the Park on Lakeside Drive, overlooking Reeds Lake. It was an extremely popular summertime venue that could seat 1,700 people. Popular plays, musicals, Vaudevillian and burlesque acts, silent films, talkies and favorite local and national entertainers, such as Will Rogers, appeared at the theater during its heyday. The theater was torn down in 1949 and the site is now occupied by the Lakewood Hills apartments. Into the 1950s, the Ramona Show Boat, a paddle wheel steam boat, circled the lake during live shows. When Ramona Park was replaced with a shopping center and apartment complex, the showboat was removed to Lowell, Michigan. Reeds Lake itself was home to two bathing beaches. Manhattan Beach was located on the north shore of the lake at the end of Pioneer Club Road and was in service from the mid-1880s to 1927. In 1884 Charles Seidel, boat builder and harbormaster on Reeds Lake, thought the property would be a fine spot for a bathing beach. He leased the land for just this purpose. The property was then purchased and developed into a more substantial beach resort by Thomas Reed in 1905 His family continued to operate the facility after he died. His daughter and her husband, Katherine and Charles Morgan, ran the facility until it closed and the property was sold in 1927. East Grand Rapids is known for its affluence and lakefront mansions. Rose's Bathing Beach and Swimming School located on the west shore of Reeds Lake on the north side of the boat launch, was established in 1901 by James Rose. German-born Rose had his own unique style of teaching people to swim. Hundreds learned under his tutelage. In addition to the bathing school and beach, there was a bathhouse and 'hamburger joint'. In the winter, when the lake was frozen, Rose's had a toboggan run, skating rink and ice hockey league. In the winters the bathhouse was crowded with skaters changing in and out of street shoes and indulging in Rose's famous caramel corn. After the bathing beach closed in the late 1960s, most of the facility was demolished. One small building was left standing. James' son John \\"Bub\\" Rose kept it open as a marina and an upscale restaurant noted for its hamburgers and caramel corn. \\"Bub\\" eventually retired to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to pursue his passion for ice boating, selling the restaurant to the Gilmore Collection, owner of several area restaurants. In 1974 East Grand Rapids came to national attention as the legal domicile of Gerald R. Ford, 38th President of the United States, although, as a serving Congressman and Vice-President, Ford had, for all practical purposes, resided in the District of Columbia area for the previous twenty-five years. Recently the downtown area known as Gaslight Village has been the focus of major reconstruction. A local developer (Jade Pig) completed a new retail center as part of a $50 million project, which also will include offices and multi-floor condominium buildings spread over a tract. In 2006 the City of East Grand Rapids performed a $3 million refurbishing of Wealthy Street with new paving, lighting and decorative features. A new 27,700 ft2 (2573.41 m2) library was opened in August 2006 at the site of the previous library on Reeds Lake next to the Grand Rapids Yacht Club.

Prior to the consolidation, Sand Lake High School, a K-12 school, served the community. Impetus for consolidation occurred when the State of Michigan adopted new standards for education which required school systems to spend additional funds. Some Sand Lake residents wished to consolidate with Cedar Springs Schools in Cedar Springs due to the strength of the Cedar Springs industrial economy and the good reputation of its school system, while others wished to consolidate with Howard City. Charles Northup, a former member of the Sand Lake school board, stated that Cedar Springs residents would have had primary control and naming of a consolidated school district including Sand Lake, while a consolidation with Howard City would result in joint control between the communities. According to a former principal of Sand Lake High, Earl Clegg, \\"community friction\\" occurred in the consolidation debate. About 300 people went to a meeting in Sand Lake on proposed school consolidation on February 13, 1961. Notable people *Dick Terwilliger, baseball player.

The population was 4,140 at the 2010 census. The village resides in Sparta Township. History The Sparta area was first settled in 1844, with the township formally organized in 1846. The first settler in what is now the village was Jonathan Nash in 1846. Calling the place Nashville, he built a sawmill on Lick Creek. Subsequently, he changed the name of the creek to Nash Creek. Seeing as there was already a Nashville in Michigan, the state legislature suggested Sparta, meaning land of the fair women. The village was platted in 1867 and incorporated in 1883. During World War II, Sparta was host to a German prisoner of war camp. The POWs were put to work as farmhands because many of the farmhands from the town had left to go fight in the war. The prisoners were treated relatively well, and later even wrote letters to the owner of the farm they worked on saying such things as, \\"I like to think back on the nice time we could spend on your farm.\\" In recent years due to the growth of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area the town has developed a more suburban flair as subdivisions of tract homes have been built in large numbers over the last decade. Music in Sparta In the early to late 1960s, Sparta was home to Fenton Records, an independent record company and recording studio. The label recorded many local bands, as well as other Michigan garage bands. Due to the limited runs of the records, Fenton vinyl 45rpms are highly collectable, often selling for hundreds of dollars each. Many of the records were recently compiled on a CD called Scream Loud!!!: The Fenton Records Story (Way Back Records) The Welcome sign for Village of Sparta.

The village is located within Allouez Township, and the population was 146 at the 2010 census. At , Ahmeek is the smallest incorporated community in the state of Michigan by land area and the only incorporated municipality in Keweenaw County. The name Ahmeek is derived from the Ojibwe (Chippewa) language.https://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu/main-entry/amik-na The village takes its name from the Ojibwe word, amik, which means \\"Beaver\\", and it was named so because of an abundance of beavers in the vicinity of the present-day village. The Ahmeek Mine was the most successful mine along the Kearsarge Amygdaloid Lode, which spans through Houghton and Keweenaw Counties, as well as the most profitable, and the largest producer along the lode. The Ahmeek Mine's Shaft's No. 3 & 4 were also one of the most distinctive in all of the Copper Country.  History  = Early days and founding = Mining itself in the community began around the year 1880 as the Ahmeek Mining Company began as an exploratory branch of the already-existing Seneca Mining Company to work the copper-rich Kearsarge Amygdaloid Lode. The Ahmeek Mining Company formally opened in 1903, thus becoming its own separate entity apart from the Seneca, however operations of the Ahmeek Mine under the newly independent company initially began in the year 1902. The local area grew because of its location on the Mineral Range Railroad. In 1908, the construction of the Ahmeek Mining Company Office was completed, as designed by the architect Paul Macneil. The village of Ahmeek was founded by Joseph Bosch, the creator of the Bosch Brewing Company, in the year of 1904. Attorney James A. Hamilton became the first postmaster of Ahmeek on 5 February 1909, the same year in which it was incorporated as a village.Romig, Walter. Michigan Place Names (Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Walter Romig, not dated) p. 13 The village was plotted by two real estate agents from Calumet by the names of Faucett and Gunk. The two agents divided the property into lots and then sold them piece by piece. As of the year of the village's incorporation, Maurice Kenel served as the first village President of Ahmeek, having been elected 15 March 1909. The village firehall was built several years later in 1911 at a total sum of $2,925 dollars. The local Calvary Cemetery, which is also known as the Ahmeek Cemetery, was created a year later in 1912. = Industrialization = Ahmeek served as a critical stop for several transportation services, mostly around the early 20th century. It served as a depot on the Mineral Range Railroad, the Copper Range Railroad, and also had a streetcar station for the Houghton County Traction Company, which ran south from Houghton up to Ahmeek, and a ways on north towards Mohawk. The Streetcar Station was completed in the year 1909 and operated under the Houghton County Traction Company until the year 1932, when it served other purposes, such as a bus stop. = Copper Country Strike of 1913-1914 = During the watershed moment that was the great Copper Country Strike of 1913‚Äì14, Ahmeek was the scene of regular tension and division in the Keweenaw, a key instance being around 6 October 1913 when a clerk at the Ahmeek Mine supply office by the name Guy Wilkins was assaulted, and shot after being confronted by a rogue mob. The strike was the culmination of much labour unrest in the area that had been fueled by unethical treatment by mining companies. The strike brought the once-tranquil and calm Copper Country to a violent turn from which it would ultimately not recover. Ahmeek in particular, also saw striking miners fire upon a trainload of hired professional strikebreakers that had been hired by the mining companies, as well as the explosion at an Ahmeek Mine smokestack. Despite a handful of local officials complaints of the lack of law and order, Judge Patrick Henry O'Brien, who presided over cases related to the violence, ruled that while the strikers were, indeed, in violation of the law, the mining companies had done hardly anything to lessen the tension, and had instead acted in ways which had increased \\"the bitterness and hostility\\" of the situation. = Later years = The Ahmeek Mining Company continued to work the Kearsarge lode through the Ahmeek Mine until the year 1923, when the mining company was incorporated into the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company. Operations of the site under the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company ceased in 1931 under effects of the Great Depression. After the Depression had concluded, the Ahmeek Mine reopened in the year 1936 and carried on until around 1966 when the mine closed permanently. On 30 April 1971, Gabriel J. Chopp, retired after thirty-nine years serving as Ahmeek's postmaster, thus making him the longest-serving postmaster of the village of Ahmeek, the only incorporated settlement in Keweenaw County. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. = Attractions = * The Gabriel J. Chopp Park, which is located within the village. * The historic Houghton County Traction Company streetcar station in Ahmeek, a federally-recognised historic site where you can now spend the night. *The Ahmeek Ice Rink and its adjacent playground on School Street. *The Keweenaw Handicraft Shop, a regional home goods store. * The ruins and leftover buildings of the Ahmeek Mine, including the Mine Office, the No. 2 Shaft of the Ahmeek Mine, as well as the Boiler house, dry house, Hoist house, and shaft of the Ahmeek Mine's No. 3 & 4 workings may be explored. * The Lower Falls of the Gratiot River is an area tourist attraction about 3.5 miles southwest of Ahmeek. * The Sand Hills Light, the last-manned lighthouse on the Great Lakes.

Attractions Tourists canoeing on the Pere Marquette River in the Manistee National Forest. Baldwin is primarily a tourist town. As such, much of its economy is based around the summer months. Lake County sports many lakes and rivers, as well as the vast wilderness of the Manistee National Forest. Many come to Baldwin on vacation to camp, canoe, fish, or hunt. The Shrine of the Pines is a noted tourist attraction. The nearby Pere Marquette River is one of America's Blue Ribbon fisheries and sportfishing is a major contributor to the local economy. The nearby Baldwin River, a tributary of the Pere Marquette River, is the site of the first planting of German Brown Trout in the United States on April 11, 1884. Baldwin is home of the world's largest trout statue. Located downtown Baldwin, the trout stands 25 feet tall. The village and Lake County take pride in this structure. javascript:void(0)https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-s-largest-brown- trout-sculpture Private prison The North Lake Correctional Facility is a private, for-profit, maximum security prison that was constructed in the late 1990s in Baldwin by the Wackenhut Corrections Co. (now the GEO Group). The prison was originally built to house Michigan's youth offenders, but the state withdrew its charges from the facility. The GEO group expanded the prison from 500 to 1,700 beds; by 2005 it was vacant. For a brief time it housed some inmates from California in 2011 but was soon closed again. In June 2015, GEO Group contracted for two years with the state of Vermont to house 280 high- security inmates convicted of crimes in the state of Vermont in the North Lake Correctional Facility. It was far from home; many had previously been housed in private prison facilities in Kentucky and Arizona. This contract was facilitated by the state legislature enacting a bill to support the private prison, specifically to authorize incarceration of high-security inmates at this facility. Lake Country Republican Rep. Jon Bumstead had sponsored a bill in the Michigan Legislature to raise the security rating of the North Lake facility to Michigan's highest in order to accomplish this. The Michigan Senate voted 23-14 to remove the former restrictive provision, making it legal for the GEO Group to house out-of-state prisoners of all security classifications in Baldwin. As Lake County has high poverty and unemployment rates, legislators thought the expanded prison could provide some jobs to local residents. County Commissioner Dan Sloan stated that as many as 150 jobs would result from the transfer of out-of-state prisoners to the facility., Vermont Digger, 29 May 2015 In December 2016 GEO Group told Vermont that it would not renew its contract with the state in June 2017; some 256 long-term prisoners from Vermont are being held at this prison.Elizabeth Hewitt, \\"Vt.
