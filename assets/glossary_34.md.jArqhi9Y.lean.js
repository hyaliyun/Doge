Between 1941 and 1970 he had small, often unbilled roles in 71 feature filmsPhotograph of Nacho Galindo with Bob Steele in a scene from the 1954 film The Outcast and at least 60 TV episodes. His most prominent film role was that of the Cisco Kid's third-billed sidekick, \\"Baby\\", in 1946's The Gay Cavalier, the first of poverty row studio Monogram's entries in the series, which starred Gilbert Roland as The Cisco Kid. Film career during the 1940s Born Ignacio Galindo in Mexico's fourth-largest municipality, Guadalajara, he emigrated to the United States by crossing the footbridge at the border crossing in Laredo, Texas, in 1927. The actor was 32 when he received uncredited bit parts in three 1941 musical comedies, Week-End in Havana (as a singing seller of lollipops), Fiesta and Rio Rita (completed in 1941, released in April 1942), where he was given the opportunity for a solo vocal in \\"The Ranger's Song\\". He was also seen in 1941 as a musician in Greta Garbo's final film, Two-Faced Woman.Nacho Galindo at Forgotten Actors Whether due to wartime military service or for other reasons, there are no specified acting credits for Galindo between December 1941, as America entered into World War II, and December 1945, which brought his first billed part, a minor role as a character named \\"Pancho\\" in the Columbia mystery serial, Who's Guilty? Following another unbilled bit, he played the biggest part of his film career in Monogram's low-budget release The Cisco Kid in The Gay Cavalier. Unlike actors Chris-Pin Martin, Martin Garralaga and Leo Carrillo who played Cisco's comical companion Gordito or Pancho in several films, The Gay Cavalier was Galindo's sole appearance in that characterization, with the sidekick called \\"Baby\\" for that single film. Film and television appearances in the 1950s and 60s Following The Gay Cavalier, Galindo returned to playing mostly unbilled bit parts for the remainder of the 1940s, having appeared in 21 features by the end of the decade. His acting assignments multiplied in the 1950s, with roles (almost all unbilled) in 43 features, including such major titles as 1950's Montana and Broken Arrow, 1952's Lone Star, 1953's Tropic Zone and The Hitch-Hiker, 1954's Broken Lance, A Star Is Born and Green Fire, 1955's Hell's Island and The Sea Chase, 1956's The Searchers and 1958's Saddle the Wind. Also, starting with a 1952 episode of the anthology series Rebound, he made 28 television appearances during the decade, with roles in such series as The Life of Riley, Adventures of Superman (both in 1953), My Little Margie and The Lone Ranger (in 1954), The 20th Century Fox Hour (in 1955), Screen Directors Playhouse, Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre and I Love Lucy [cigar store owner in \\"The Ricardos Visit Cuba\\"] (in 1956), Maverick (in 1958) and Zorro in 1959. Starting with the January 31, 1960, installment of Maverick, Nacho Galindo's acting assignments during the 1960s consisted almost entirely of TV episodes, including Wanted Dead or Alive and Checkmate (in 1960), Mister Ed, Peter Gunn and Perry MasonPhotograph of Nacho Galindo from an appearance in \\"The Case of the Travelling Treasure\\" episode of Perry Mason (in 1961), The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis and 77 Sunset Strip (in 1962), 77 Sunset Strip, Perry Mason and Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel (in 1963), Burke's Law (in 1965), The Wild Wild West, Cimarron Strip and The MonkeesPhotograph of Nacho Galindo from an appearance in A Nice Place to Visit episode of The Monkees (in 1967), The Flying Nun, I Spy and Gunsmoke (in 1968), Family Affair and My Three Sons (in 1969). There were 29 such television appearances in addition to 6 theatrical features, including vehicles for Marlon Brando (1961's One-Eyed Jacks), Frank Sinatra, Deborah Kerr and Dean Martin (1965's Marriage on the Rocks) as well as John Wayne and Robert Mitchum (1966's El Dorado). His only work in the 1970s was his last remaining credit, an October 1970 episode of Adam-12. Nacho Galindo (right) with Marlon Brando in One-Eyed Jacks (1961).

In the late 19th century, those Russian leaders concerned with the welfare of the Pomors (settlers of the Russian north, particularly on the White Sea coast) became convinced of the need to provide more scientific support for the area's fishing industry (a major activity for the Pomors). Accordingly, with the assent of Finance Minister Sergei Witte, Saint Andrew was commissioned. Formally, construction of the ship was funded by the \\"Aid Committee For The Settlers Of The Russian North\\", but actually the construction was paid for out of the imperial treasury. Saint Andrew was built to specifications developed by fisheries science pioneer Nikolai Knipovich, in the German Bremer Vulkan shipyard. It was designed as a yacht, but with a stern rigged for trawling. Construction began in 1897 and the ship was launched in 1899. (Expeditions began before that, in 1898, using the small sailing vessel Pomor, which had been purchased in Norway.) Until 1907, Saint Andrew was an expedition vessel for field expeditions of the Murman Scientific Fisheries Expedition, based in Aleksandrovsk-on-Murman (now Polyarny) near Murmansk. The expeditions were led by Nikolai Knipovich (and later Leonid L. Breytfus). Research carried out on this vessel was the beginning of commercial oceanography. Captain Chicagov in 1906 From the beginning of its voyages, Vasily N. Chichagov (a descendant of the noble Chichagov family and a seaman and student of hydrography from the Saint Petersburg Yacht Club) was a member of expeditions, serving as captain of Saint Andrew from 1903 to 1907. (After Saint Andrew was sold, Chichagov worked for the Directorate of Lighthouses and Navigation in the White Sea.) In 1906 the Murman Scientific Fisheries Expedition lost its financial support (there had been some earlier government dissatisfaction with what was perceived as over-emphasis on pure science as opposed to immediately practical research) and soon shut down. In 1907 Saint Andrew was transferred to the Russian Navy. In 1910, the ship was renamed Murman.

Developed to support teaching, research and scholarship, its holdings reflect fonds and collections pertaining to Canadian literature, politics, popular culture and business history, in addition to war and peace in the 20th century with an emphasis on the Holocaust and Resistance. It also holds a collection of eighteenth century books and journals, and is home to the Bertrand Russell Archives. Part of the McMaster University Library system, the Division of Archives and Research Collections is located in Mills Memorial Library. History The Division of Archives and Research Collections is named after William Ready who served as University Librarian from 1966 until his retirement in 1979. In 2002 the Archives was awarded the Archives Association of Ontario's Institutional Award in recognition of its strong archival program and service to the community. =William Ready= William Bernard Ready (pronounced Reedy) was born on September 16, 1914 in Cardiff, Wales to James Ready and Nora Hart. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Wales in 1937, a Master of Arts from the University of Manitoba in 1949 and a Master of Library Science from the University of Western Ontario in 1970, in addition to several diplomas related to archives and library administration. Ready married Bessie Dyer (1917-2007) on April 25, 1945 and together they had six children. Ready considered himself a \\"working librarian\\" and rejected the academic side of librarianship in favour of hands-on work and collection development He was known for his enterprising and cunning approach to building and managing archives and research collections. Having read and enjoyed The Hobbit, Ready asked a London-based book dealer to contact J. R. R. Tolkien about acquiring his works for Marquette University. Concerned about his retirement, Tolkien initially agreed to sell a selection of manuscripts. Further negotiation led to Marquette's acquisition of the manuscripts for The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, among others, amounting to more than 11,000 pages. During the same period Ready also secured the personal papers of social activist Dorothy Day. As University Librarian at McMaster he played an instrumental role in securing numerous high-profile collections, most notably the archives of philosopher and political activist Bertrand Russell. Ready died in Victoria, British Columbia on September 12, 1981, two years after retiring from McMaster. His autobiography, Files on Parade, was published posthumously in 1982. Collections The holdings of the Division of Archives and Research Collections reflect a broad spectrum of Canadian popular culture ranging from the records of Canadian publishers and advertisers to the personal papers of internationally recognized authors and musicians. Included are writers Louise Bennett-Coverley, Pierre Berton, Austin Clarke, Marian Engel, Basil H. Johnston and Farley Mowat and singer-songwriters Bruce Cockburn, Ian Thomas and Jackie Washington. A sample of Alice Munro's handwriting, whose letters appears in the fonds of publishers Macmillan Canada and McClelland & Stewart, appeared on a commemorative stamp released by Canada Post in 2015. Personal papers and research collections of non-Canadian figures are equally well represented by holdings pertaining to Samuel Beckett, Vera Brittain, Thomas Carlyle and Sir George Catlin. The Division of Archives and Research Collection also holds the only surviving manuscript of Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange. The manuscript, along with several of Burgess' early works, was acquired by McMaster as a result of Ready's persistence and eventual friendship with the author. McMaster's copy is of particular interest because it includes the final chapter that was omitted by American publishers of the work. The manuscript contains an annotation in Burgess' hand that reads \\"Should we end here?\\", indicating that he questioned its inclusion. Other items held by the Archives include sheet music from the First World War, historical postcards, and a figure skating collection consisting of books, programs, photographs and postcards. =The Bertrand Russell Archives= Russell in 1936 McMaster University is home to the Bertrand Russell Archives. Manuscripts, correspondence, newspaper clippings and other textual records, in addition to photographs and audio visual resources, make up the more than 140 meters of material held by the Archives. Russell's personal library and furniture from his home in Penrhyndeudraeth, Wales are also housed at McMaster. Russell's letters, totalling approximately 50,000, provide insight about his personal and political dealings addressing topics such as his love live, his thoughts on teaching and pacifism, and his experiences in prison. Joseph Conrad, T.S. Eliot, Nikita Khrushchev, Lady Constance Malleson, Ho Chi Minh, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Dorothy Maud Wrinch are among Russell's numerous correspondents. Russell's personal papers were purchased in 1968 for $520,000, with the first transfer of records consisting of 11 filing cabinets and 15 metal trunks. At the time, it was the most money spent on the personal papers of one person, topping what was paid for the personal papers of Leon Trotsky and W. B. Yeats. That a Canadian university was able to secure Russell's papers has been linked to his disapproval of the United States' role in Vietnam. There was, however, interest from American universities, most notably the University of Texas, which dried up after an erroneous report in Newsweek indicated that Russell intended to use the funds to support war efforts in North Vietnam. Selling his papers was, in actuality, a means to support the work of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation.

This pattern was identified by the members of the HEARSAY-II project and first applied to speech recognition. Structure The blackboard model defines three main components: * blackboard - a structured global memory containing objects from the solution space * knowledge sources - specialized modules with their own representation * control component - selects, configures and executes modules. Implementation The first step is to design the solution space (i.e. potential solutions) that leads to the blackboard structure. Then, knowledge sources are identified. These two activities are closely related. The next step is to specify the control component; it generally takes the form of a complex scheduler that makes use of a set of domain-specific heuristics to rate the relevance of executable knowledge sources. System Structure Applications Usage-domains include: * speech recognition * vehicle identification and tracking * protein structure identification * sonar signals interpretation. Consequences The blackboard pattern provides effective solutions for designing and implementing complex systems where heterogeneous modules have to be dynamically combined to solve a problem. This provides non- functional properties such as: * reusability * changeability * robustness. The blackboard pattern allows multiple processes to work closer together on separate threads, polling and reacting when necessary.

It was produced by Moving Target Films in association with Dartmouth Films and was first shown in 2011. Production Filmmaker Gordon Wilson was jobless and homeless when he attended a free workshop at Film Oxford on Catherine Street in Oxford. Inspired by the relationship between Gordon Wilson and his partner Robbie Burns, the film documents six years in the life of his friend Nigel Fletcher and took seven years to complete. Wilson had met and lived with Nigel Fletcher at a halfway house. Through scenes dealing with abuse, mental illness and alcoholism, the film tells the story of the two's friendship and shows the relationship between the pair. Burns died before the film was finished. According to the filmmakers: > Every year, thousands of people slip through the net of social care > provision into a dark, lonely and often dangerous underworld. Nigel is one > of those people. Abandoned by those who should have been caring for him, > abused and vulnerable Nigel lived under the radar of social services for 66 > months. In this hostile environment, Nigel came to rely on Robbie, an > alcoholic. Together they lived in poverty in the midst of the dreaming > spires of Oxford. And so began their troubling, disturbing but genuinely > loving relationship. After 66 months Nigel was finally picked up by social > services and was provided with a secure and safe place to stay. Told from > Nigel‚Äôs perspective, this film juxtaposes his present experience of > institutional life with a series of memories and flashbacks from his time in > the 'wild'. The film was shot over six years and gives an extraordinary > insight into a hidden world, made possible only by the close relationship > between the filmmakers and contributors. Many difficult questions are raised > about abusive relationships, mental illness and society‚Äôs duty of care.

He was the head of the House of Lara and a close personal friend of Alfonso X. The king's policies often stymied his efforts to increase the power and wealth of his house, and in 1272 he led many prominent noblemen into open rebellion. Restored to favour the next year, he died defending the castle of √âcija from a Moroccan invasion. Early life and family Nu√±o was the younger son of Gonzalo N√∫√±ez de Lara and Mar√≠a D√≠az, daughter of Count Diego L√≥pez II of the House of Haro. His older brother was Diego Gonz√°lez, who died around 1239. Nu√±o was raised on the Lara estates near Villaldemiro and Celada. He became the closest friend of the future Alfonso X during the prince's childhood (1223‚Äì31), when King Ferdinand III sent him to be raised away from the royal court. Nu√±o did not receive a large inheritance, and had little or no political influence within the kingdom prior to Diego's death. In 1240, Ferdinand III gave Prince Alfonso a house and an income. Nu√±o was a frequent visitor to the prince's court, along with other childhood friends, like the children of Alfonso's erstwhile guardian, Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez de Villamayor. Nu√±o rose to prominence as a military commander under King Ferdinand in the 1240s. After Alfonso became king in 1252, Nu√±o became a regular attendee of the royal court. He was a frequent signatory of royal charters between 1252 and 1256. As an indication of his closeness to the king, he usually signed first after the prelates and members of the royal family, in the highest position possible for a lay non-royal lord. He married Teresa Alfonso, illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n, and they had two sons: Juan N√∫√±ez I and Nu√±o Gonz√°lez II. Tenancies and properties In 1255, Nu√±o led the royal army that defeated Alfonso's rebellious brother Henry near Lebrija, forcing him into exile. Three times he put down Mud√©jar rebellions: at Jerez de la Frontera in 1255, at √âcija in 1262‚Äì63 and at Matrera in 1263. He was granted the relatively safe tenancies of Bureba, La Rioja and Castilla la Vieja in northern Castile, and also the more active tenancies of the fortresses of √âcija, Jerez and Seville on the frontier, in areas where Christians Spaniards were only beginning to settle in large numbers. Given the large number of estates that came into the crown's possession in the mid-thirteenth century, Alfonso X was not particularly generous with Nu√±o. The nobleman received only one large estate, Corixad Albat, which formed the kernel of the municipality of Herrera. He also received some land at Aznalc√°zar, some houses in Seville in 1258 and some windmills in Alcal√° de Guadaira. This was the extent of royal grants of land he received. He and his wife possessed some windmills at Alcal√° acquired by other means and sold them to the Order of Santiago in exchange for a house in San Miguel de Bobadilla in December 1259. During the period when he was tenant of √âcija, he bought some bodegas there as well. In all, Nu√±o's properties seem to have supported a retinue of about 300 knights. In 1260, Nu√±o arranged his son Juan's marriage to Teresa √Ålvarez de Azagra, heiress of the lordship of Albarrac√≠n. This was a large, autonomous lordship lying between the Castile, Aragon and Valencia. Jerez (1261‚Äì64) In the spring or summer of 1261, Alfonso X conquered Jerez. He appointed Nu√±o as the first Christian alcaide (castellan) of the alc√°zar (citadel) of Jerez de la Frontera. Nu√±o appointed the knight Garc√≠a G√≥mez Carrillo as his commander on the spot. By 1264 the Muslim townspeople had constructed a wall between the town and the citadel. That year, with support from the Marinids of Morocco, they rebelled and attacked the citadel, where Nu√±o was in command with only a few knights. He immediately appealed to the king at Seville and demanded that he come in person to relieve him. When no help was forthcoming, Nu√±o abandoned his post, leaving only a small garrison behind. A small relief force from Seville arrived too late. The citadel fell and the garrison was massacred on 8 August. Nu√±o was reprimanded for his failure to defend the citadel. Alfonso, in Cantiga 345, refers to Nu√±o's flight as something that \\"by law and custom ought not to be\\". The law in question is found in the Siete Partidas (2, 18), which lists the obligations of an alcaide. Despite the dishonour he had brought upon himself, Nu√±o was compensated for the loss of revenue from Jerez. Slide into rebellion (1267‚Äì73) In 1266, the Banu Ashqilula, the most powerful family in the Kingdom of Granada after the ruling Nasrids, and in control of the port of M√°laga, approached Alfonso X to ask for an alliance against King Ibn al-Ahmar of Granada. A written agreement was signed wherein Alfonso promised to lead an army in person against Granada if Ibn al-Ahmar attacked the Banu Ashqilula. He also sent Nu√±o with an army of 1,000 knights to Banu Ashqilula. Nu√±o perhaps got as far as M√°laga, but there is no record of his army doing any fighting. In 1267, the Treaty of Alcal√° de Benzaide restored peace between Castile and Granada. As early as 1267, cracks began to appear in Nu√±o's relationship with the crown. On 16 February 1267, in the Treaty of Badajoz, Alfonso quitclaimed his usufruct over the Algarve, relinquishing all his claims on it to King Denis of Portugal. In return Portugal relinquished all the Algarve east of the Guadiana to Castile. The original agreement dated to 1253, when Alfonso's daughter Beatrice married Afonso III of Portugal. As part of that agreement, Portugal had renewed payment of tribute‚Äîthe annual service of fifty knights‚Äîto Castile. Nu√±o, in a meeting of the cortes with King Denis present, had strongly advised Alfonso against relinquishing the tribute. This caused a very public disagreement between Nu√±o and the king. Ultimately, the king had his way. In June 1268, as his one-year truce with the Banu Ashqilula was winding down, Ibn al-Ahmar travelled to Seville to confer with Alfonso X. He failed in his attempt to pull Alfonso and the Banu Ashqilula apart, but he did gain a disaffected Castilian nobleman as an ally. Nu√±o's son and namesake, Nu√±o II, visited the king of Granada in his tent and complained of the injustices and ignominies his family had suffered under Alfonso X. Ibn al-Ahmar was willing to help the Laras obtain justice in exchange for their military assistance against the Banu Ashqilula. He gave the younger Nu√±o a gift of jewels and told him to inform his father and brother, Juan N√∫√±ez, of their agreement. In late 1269, Nu√±o sought to enter the service of King James I of Aragon, who was in Burgos for the wedding of Alfonso X's son, Fernando de la Cerda. He offered James the service of one or two hundred knights, but was only dissuaded by James himself, who was on good terms with Alfonso. Shortly after this, Nu√±o left for the service of King Henry I of Navarre, with whom the disaffected nobles had been in contact since 1268. He may have been led to abandon Castile by the approval of an extraordinary tax (six servicios) by the cortes held in Burgos in November. By 1272, Nu√±o he had entered open rebellion in collusion with Castile's enemies, along with a group of high-ranking nobles. In June 1272, the Marinids invaded Castile from Morocco. Alfonso X ordered a general mobilisation, summoning his noblemen to appear on the frontier under the command of his brother Manuel and son Fernando. The refusal of a great many to appear was the start of the nobles' rebellion. The leaders of the revolt, including Nu√±o and the king's brother Philip, had been in contact with the Marinid emir, Abu Yusuf, and his son Abd al-Wahid. Eleven letters sent by the Marinid ruler and his son to the rebel leaders were intercepted by the king's men. Before Abu Yusuf the rebels accused Alfonso X of debasing the coinage, violating their customary privileges, causing inflation and favouring merchants. Abu Yusuf encouraged Nu√±o to send his son Nu√±o to him in Morocco, where he promised to make the younger Nu√±o \\"king\\" of the Christians, that is, commander of the Christian militia he had raised. Before the end of 1272, Nu√±o and several other rebel leaders had paid homage and swore fealty to Ibn al- Ahmar of Granada. Their stated aim was to restore the Treaty of Alcal√° de Benzaide and the Portuguese tribute. Despite the clear evidence of treason, the nobles participated in the cortes that convened in Burgos in November. Alfonso granted some concessions, but not enough to satisfy the rebels. Nu√±o and the other ringleaders determined to go into exile in Granada, but not without plundering the kingdom as they went. Nu√±o's sons joined him in exile. Upon their arrival in Granada, Ibn al-Ahmar sent the Castilians to plunder the land around Guadix that belonged to the Banu Ashqilula. When Ibn al-Ahmar died on 12 January 1273, there was a dispute over the succession, but the Castilian exiles' support for his son, Abu Abd Allah, secured him the throne. Defending √âcija (1273‚Äì75) In 1273, the new king of Granada and the rebels were quick to open negotiations with Alfonso. In July, Alfonso and the rebels reached an agreement at Seville. The number of servicios was reduced to four and the Fuero real (which gave privileges to the towns) was abolished. In December a truce was agreed with the king of Granada. In March 1274, Nu√±o, now back in the king of Castile's service, attended the royal court in Burgos. Alfonso granted Nu√±o the tenancy of √âcija, which the 14th-century Cr√≥nica de Alfonso X inflated into his being made adelantado mayor de la frontera, the commander-in-chief in charge of the defence of the southern frontier. In fact, the king's illegitimate son Alfonso Fern√°ndez el Ni√±o, based in Seville, was given command of the frontier. On account of the truce, however, the frontier was quiet and Nu√±o and his son Juan even contemplated answering the call of the Second Council of Lyon (18 May 1274) for a new crusade to the Holy Land. A Marinid invasion in May 1275 prevented him from doing so. After initial campaigns towards Seville and Ja√©n, Abu Yusuf personally led the main Marinid army against √âcija. Although some had advised him to avoid pitched battle, Nu√±o chose to follow the advice of others, who counselled that a pitched battle was the only way to save his honour. The Moroccan historian Ibn Abi Zar, who calls Nu√±o \\"the cursed one\\", records that he led a massive army with breastplates, chain mail, banners and trumpets. Nu√±o died in the battle of √âcija, probably on Sunday, 8 September 1275, as recorded by Ibn Abi Zar. The only Christian source to date the battle, the Anales Toledanos III, puts it on Saturday, 7 September. According to Ibn Abi Zar, the Marinid emir would have preferred to take Nu√±o alive. He ordered all the dead Christians beheaded on the field of battle. He could not take √âcija, defended by 300 knights, and therefore withdrew. He entered Algeciras in triumph on 18 September, with Nu√±o's head prominently displayed on a pole. Afterwards, he sent Nu√±o's head to the king of Granada. Given that Abu Abd Allah owed his throne largely to the intervention of Nu√±o, whom he knew personally, this was calculated to offend. Out of friendship with Nu√±o and hatred of the Marinids, Abu Abd Allah had the head embalmed in musk and camphor and sent secretly to C√≥rdoba for burial with the body. His reunited head and body were brought from C√≥rdoba to the convent of San Pablo in Palencia, where they were buried. Nu√±o's wife, Teresa, was also buried there.

He is the first known Anglo-Norman poet to write in the Anglo-Norman French vernacular language, rather than Latin. Philip was probably a member of the noble family that held Than or Thaon in Normandy, near Caen. He may have arrived in England late in the 11th century, perhaps following his uncle who was an official for Prince Henry, later King Henry I of England. Paul Meyer disagreed with attributing noble birth to Philip, arguing instead that he was from an unknown background.Beer \\"Thaun, Philip de (fl. 1113x19‚Äì1121x35)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Three works by Philip survive. The first is the Comput, or Computus, written in 1113. The Comput contains the first surviving example of scientific, or technical French; Philippe's intent in publishing the Comput was to improve the pastoral care provided by secular priests, and he seems to have followed the example of earlier Old English computi in doing so. The Comput deals with the calendar, and is written in hexasyllabic couplets, using as its sources Bede, Chilperic of St Gall, Pliny the Elder, and Garlandus Compotista, as well as an obscure clerk of Henry I's named Thurkil. It was dedicated to Philip's uncle, Humphrey de Thaon, who was chaplain to Eudo Dapifer. Philip's second work is the Bestiaire, or Bestiary',Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 497 dedicated to Queen Adeliza of Louvain and written between 1121 and 1139 in French.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 45 The Bestiarie is a translation of the Physiologus. It is a poem mostly in rhyming hexasyllabic couplets, with the final three hundred or so lines in octosyllabic verse. It is divided into a prologue, 38 chapters ‚Äì 35 on animals and 3 on precious stones ‚Äì and an epilogue. Although the translation is not considered a literary masterpiece, it is the earliest surviving translation of the Physiologus into French and is a critical reference for Anglo-Norman French. The Bestiaire is one of two works from medieval England that relates the story that a crocodile cries when it eats a human. This story is the basis for the phrase \\"crocodile tears\\".Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 675 Philip's last surviving work is Le Livre de Sibile. This work is a translation into French of a Latin poem, the Prophecy of the Tibertine Sibyl. Philip dedicated his translation to Matilda, the daughter of King Henry I.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 656 It is also in hexasyllabic verse and also includes some information from a work by Adso of Montier-en-Der entitled Libellus de Antichristo. The only extant manuscript of Le Livre does not have any indication that the work was by Philip, however. Three other works have occasionally been attributed to Philip but are not considered to be definitely written by him. These are the Debat de l'ame et du corps and two lapidaries ‚Äì one alphabetical and one apocalyptic.

While at the International Blues Challenge D√∏vydas jammed with many musicians including the mountain dulcimer player Bing Futch. Early life Dovydas Ma≈°ƒçinskas was born in Kaunas, the second largest city of Lithuania. His father is a painter, and his mother stayed at home to raise him. D√∏vydas began playing guitar at the age 13, and after taking private lessons from older guitar-playing friends, he enrolled at the Kaunas Children Music School. Later, he studied classical guitar at Naujalis Music Gymnasium, and in 2010, he transferred to Kaunas Juozas Gruodis Music Conservatory. Career D√∏vydas started playing guitar at the age of thirteen in Lithuania, learning the drums, bass, piano, xylophone and harmonica shortly after. He was heavily inspired by a blues CD that his father bought in Germany, entitled Blues Giants Vol. 2, a compilation of blues songs from artist such as John Lee Hooker, Lightnin' Hopkins, BB King, Etta James, and Memphis Slim. D√∏vydas says, \\"It was magic. That CD with those songs was like having an invitation letter to Hogwarts. Not only the music was captivating and enchanting, they were singing in this amazing language, and they lived in this distant part of the world that I've only seen on television.\\" During school he formed his first band, \\"David Smash and the Smash Band\\", which was later shortened to simply \\"David Smash Band\\". The group began playing local competitions and festivals and after their appearances on national television, they received invitations to headline major music festivals in Lithuania and Poland. He linked up with local blues musician Steve Arvey and moved to Florida at the age of 19. In his first two years in Sarasota, D√∏vydas expanded his musical repertoire and integrated himself into the local music scene. After signing a contract with the Del Couch Music Education Foundation and Howling Dog Studios, D√∏vydas has released two CDs in the United States, one of them titled State Of Sunshine. Musical influences D√∏vydas was influenced by American music recordings owned by his parents. Among his most notable influences, he lists Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, James Brown, Jerry Lee Lewis, Nat King Cole, Dean Martin. D√∏vydas references Steve Vai as one of his favorite guitarists. D√∏vydas' impromptu rendition of the song \\"Tender Surrender\\" by Vai gained him significant success within the YouTube community and viewership has steadily increased since that time. Coming to America After graduating high school D√∏vydas was planning on moving and taking his music beyond Lithuania, with Germany and the United Kingdom in mind. One night a blues musician from the United States came across D√∏vydas' Lithuania's Got Talent performance video and reached out to him on Facebook. Steve and D√∏vydas began communicating via email which led to D√∏vydas leaving Lithuania for the United States.

Increased Russian military aggression and hostile Turkish territorial responses have all contributed to increasing escalation. Aerial confrontations between the two nations have grown more common. Turkey accuses Russian Forces of violating Turkish sovereign airspace and war crimes against Syrian Turkmens. The Russian military has accused Turkey of illegal economic ties with ISIS and planning a military intervention in Syria and Libya.  Timeline  = Syria = *On 22 June 2012, Syrian Arab Army air defenses shot down a Turkish Air Force RF-4E reconnaissance fighter 15 miles off of the coast of Latakia over the Mediterranean Sea within international airspace several dozen minutes after it had briefly veered into Syrian air space, prompting the Turkish Armed Forces to change its rules of engagement formally declaring hostility towards any aircraft approaching the Turkish-Syrian border. This led to many future shoot- downs conducted by the Turkish Air Force. Both pilots were killed and an autopsy revealed the pilots survived the initial crash once the wreckage was located and the bodies were recovered. Alleged secret documents were leaked by the Syrian opposition to Al Arabiya, claiming that the two pilots had survived the shoot down, which was done in coordination with the Russian naval facility in Tartus, and were captured but later executed with their bodies being returned to the crash site by Russian Special Operations teams. *On 11 October 2012 acting upon intelligence received from the National Intelligence Organization, Turkish Air Force F-4 Terminator 2020s and F-16s intercepted a Syrian Air Airbus A320 flying from Moscow to Damascus over the Black Sea and forced it to land at Ankara Esenboƒüa Airport in Turkey. Upon an inspection by Gendarmerie troops the aircraft was found to be carrying munitions and weaponry to Syria using Turkish Airspace to transport items to the Syrian regime by way of civilian air travel. Russia claimed that items found were radio, radar and other technical equipment instead of military munitions. Russia further accused Turkey of endangering Russian lives while the Turkish ministry underlined that it had previously warned the international community of the alleged war crimes conducted and overseen by Russia. *On 16 September 2013, Turkish Air Force F-16s shot down a Mi-17 helicopter belonging to the Syrian Army after it allegedly violated Turkish airspace up to 2 kilometers. *On 23 March 2014, Turkish Air Force F-16s shot down a MiG-23 belonging to the Syrian Air Force. * On 3 October 2015, a Russian MiG-29 crossed into Turkish airspace and allegedly chased and harassed intercepting Turkish Air Force F-16s over the Syrian border for a total of four minutes before prompting the Turkish fighter jets to put the aggressing Russian aircraft on missile lock-on prompting them to discontinue harassment and change their flight course back to Syria immediately. * On 3 October 2015, a Russian Air Force Su-30 crossed into Turkish Airspace over the Hatay Province and was intercepted by Turkish two F-16's that were patrolling the border in the vicinity.

The Russian defense ministry analysts announced they were aware of the deployment and informed that the jammers have reduced the range of there missile systems by 20% which rendered the missiles incapable of hitting targets inside of Turkey. Russian defense ministry officials also explained the new deployment interfered with radar, data-links and limited navigational functions amongst Russian aircraft. *On 6 December 2015, while a Russian navy warship was passing through the Bosphorus which bisects Istanbul a serviceman was seen brandishing an shoulder carried rocket launcher allegedly at the city center.

The deployment continued to increase already fuelled tensions between the two nations and came notably after the U.N. rejected a Russian draft proposal to halt Turkish shelling of SDF positions in Syria. *On 24 February 2016, the Royal Saudi Air Force enforced its presence in Turkey's Incirlik Air Base near the Syrian border by sending 4 additional F-15C aerial superiority fighters increasing the total number of F-15's to ten and additionally sent 2 C-130 cargo planes full of technical equipment and 30 Saudi military engineers and technicians.

West Midwood is located in central Brooklyn in the southern edge of the community of Victorian Flatbush, abutting the northern boundary of the community of Midwood. It is bordered by Foster Avenue to the north, the BMT Brighton subway line () to the east, Avenue H to the south, and Coney Island Avenue to the west. West Midwood is located south of Prospect Park within what is sometimes referred to as Ditmas Park. West Midwood, along with other neighborhoods within Ditmas Park, is policed by the 70th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. West Midwood is part of Brooklyn Community District 14. History Spurred by its success developing Vanderveer Park, the first Victorian Flatbush neighborhood, in 1899, the Germania Real Estate and Improvement Company (Germania) purchased the land on which West Midwood and neighboring communities Midwood Park and Fiske Terrace were to be built. The land was purchased from the Lott family‚Äôs extensive farmland holdings, which dated back over 200 years to Peter Lott, who migrated to Flatbush, from Holland in 1652. V‚Äôlacks Bos (Anglicized Flatbush), meaning ‚Äúwooded plain‚Äù in Dutch, also carried the name Midwout (Anglicized Midwood), meaning ‚Äúmiddle-woods‚Äù in Dutch, and the names both reflected the wooded nature of the area and contrasted against Flatlands, an area to the south that was devoid of woods. In addition to development by Germania, between 1905 and 1908, architect and builder Thomas Benton Ackerson‚Äôs eponymous T.B. Ackerson Company, simultaneously built and sold forty-two detached homes along Westminster Road in West Midwood for $10,000 each. Design and construction of these houses conformed to Ackerson‚Äôs ‚Äúvillage in the city‚Äù vision and houses were graced with columns and fine details. Similarly, Germania advertised the neighborhood as ‚Äúcountry living in the city.‚Äù To maintain its suburban aesthetic, utilities and train tracks were kept underground and streets were lined with trees, mainly London Planes and maples. Further keeping with the park-like ambiance, the original property deeds forbade construction of front yard fences. In keeping with West Midwood‚Äôs small-town character, residents host annual community-building events such as a Progressive Dinner, a Halloween Parade for the children of Flatbush, and a summer block party, in addition to publishing a seasonal newsletter, among other activities. New residents are invited to join the West Midwood Community Association, which dates back to the neighborhood‚Äôs early years. Transportation New York City Subway stations serving West Midwood are Newkirk Plaza () and Avenue H (). MTA buses traveling through the area include the . Bike lanes connect West Midwood to greater Victorian Flatbush, Cortelyou Road, Prospect Park and its Parade Ground, Brooklyn College, and Ocean Parkway.

The area is remote and relatively undisturbed, being 80 km from a town. Topography The region is in the foothills of southwest Yakutia, on the Prilenskoye-Aldan plateau, an area cut by river valleys. The major rivers of the Prilenskoye plateau are the Tuolby and Amga River. Within the borders of the reserve are 85 streams and rivers stretching from 3 to 110 km, acting as tributaries of the Olyokma, Tuolby, and Amga. Climate and Ecoregion Olyokma is located in the East Siberian taiga ecoregion. The ecoregion covers the area between the Yenisei River and Lena River down to the Okhotsk Sea. Its northern border reaches the Arctic Circle, and its southern border reaches 52¬∞N latitude. The dominant vegetation is light coniferous taiga with Dahurian larch Larix gmelini forming the canopy in areas with low snow cover. This ecoregion is rich in minerals. The climate of Olyokma is Subarctic climate, without dry season (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate (Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1-3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). Snow begins in October in Olekminsky, and last on average 200 days. Average annual precipitation is 400‚Äì500 mm. Flora and fauna The reserve is covered 88% by forest, mostly conifers. Some zoning is seen: above 1,000 meters are more tundra communities, in a belt at 900‚Äì1000 meters is a sub-taiga of Dahurian larch, and from 400‚Äì900 meters is larch-pine forest with alder and rhododendron understory. Olyokma is notable for relatively high levels of bidoversity: of the total 1,010 species of vascular plants in the East Siberian taiga ecoregion, 650 are found in Olyokma. Ecotourism As a scientific nature reserve, the Olyokma Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with reserve management for visits. There are a few 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve that are made available to a limited number of school groups and ecotourists accompanied by reserve guides, and which require permits to be obtained in advance. The main office is in the city of Olekminsk.

Addie Aylestock (1909-1998) was a Canadian minister in the British Methodist Episcopal Church, the first woman minister to be ordained in that church, and the first black woman to be ordained in Canada.  Personal Life  Aylestock was the daughter of William Aylestock and Minnie Lawson and was the eldest of eight children. She was born in Glen Allan, Ontario, near Elmira, Ontario, from one of the many black farming communities in the province of Ontario; her family lived depending on where work was available. Her family was descended from blacks who settled along the Conestogo River in Regional Municipality of Waterloo and Wellington County, Ontario. She was raised in the (white) Methodist Church; she moved to Toronto when the Great Depression struck, and got a job as a domestic servant, and later as a dressmaker. While working as a domestic servant, she attended evening classes at Central Technical School in Toronto. A desire to become a missionary (in Liberia) led her to enroll in the (transdenominational) Toronto Bible College, from which she graduated in 1945. While a student in college, Aylestock became active with the youth and working with Sunday school in a BME (British Methodist Episcopal) church on Chestnut Street in Toronto. The pastor encouraged Aylestock to consider becoming a deaconess. She joined the British Methodist Episcopal Church (an offshoot of the African Methodist Episcopal Church) and became a deaconess in 1944. Her first position was in the church in Africville. She also served as a deaconess in Halifax, Montreal, and Toronto. After the BME allowed for the ordination of women in 1951 (prompted by the church superintendent's belief in Aylestock's capability), she was the first to be ordained, and was assigned to the BME Church in North Buxton. She served as pastor in three further churches, namely in Montreal, Toronto and Owen Sound.; Kim Brooks, Welcome to the revolution, in Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies, University of British Columbia ed., Reflections of Canada, 2017, p. 55 Aylestock's obituary, published in the St. Catharines Standard, said she also presided over churches in Fort Erie and Niagara Falls.

In the 1830s, with the increasing size of the congregation, the church was enlarged. A tower, side galleries and a larger vestry were added. On 23 September 1832, the church was reopened. From 1845, priests from St Philip and St James Church started a mission in the centre of the town, which became St Joseph's Church.Stockport - St Joseph from English Heritage, retrieved 5 February 2016 =Construction= With the increasing Catholic population a larger church was needed. Our Lady of the Apostles Church replaced St Philip and St James Church. In 1905, the church was built. It was designed by Edmund Kirby. The front of the church is similar to Sacred Heart Church in Chorley which Kirby designed in 1894. The stained-glass windows in the church was attributed to Margaret Agnes Rope. In 1925, the sanctuary was redesigned to become a First World War memorial. The sanctuary was re-ordered in 1989 to bring it into line with post Vatican-Two requirements. Organ The church contains a 3 manual pipe organ with 49 speaking stops and 2088 pipes. The organ was originally built by the local organ builders Hardy & Son as a 2 manual instrument. The organ was rebuilt and considerably enlarged by the Manchester company of Jardine & Co in 1955. In 1985 George Sixsmith, organ builders, carried out further changes including the rebuild of the choir organ as well as adding new pipes and other minor changes. Apart from the changes to the choir section, the instrument remains largely similar to the rebuild of 1955. Parish Mass times are (usually) 7pm Monday, 12:15pm other weekdays.

The large municipality existed from 1865 until 1965. It was called H√∏gsfjord from 1865 until 1871 when the municipality was reduced in size and the name was changed to H√∏le. The municipality originally was quite large, surrounding both sides of the H√∏gsfjorden and Lysefjorden. Throughout its history, it included large parts of the present-day municipalities of Sandnes and Gjesdal. Since 1965, the area of H√∏le has been the borough of H√∏le in Sandnes municipality. H√∏le Church was the main church of the municipality. History The municipality of H√∏gsfjord was established in 1865 when it was separated from the large municipality of Strand. Initially, there were 3,203 residents. On 1 January 1871 the district Fossan located east of the H√∏gsfjorden (population: 2,081) was split off from H√∏gsfjord to form a municipality of its own. The remaining part of H√∏gsfjord changed its name to H√∏le, and had a population of 1,122. On 1 January 1965, there were many municipal mergers in Norway due to the recommendations of the Schei Committee. On that date, the municipality of H√∏le was dissolved. The southeastern corner of H√∏le surrounding the farming village of Oltesvik (population: 37) was transferred to the municipality of Gjesdal. The rest of H√∏le, with 926 inhabitants, was incorporated into the neighboring municipality of Sandnes.

History  Milwaukee-area comics enthusiasts Sinkovec and Tiefenbacher (a University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee art school graduate) met through letters printed in comics fanzines. Fans of adventure comic strips, which by the early 1970s had mostly disappeared from American newspapers, they banded together to publish The Menomonee Falls Gazette to keep the genre alive. In the company's early years, they published a selection of 32-page comic one-shots featuring a single character, such as The Cisco Kid, Jungle Jim, Krazy Kat, Prince Valiant, Rip Kirby, and Flash Gordon. The dedicated partners struggled financially from the start, but nonetheless in 1973 took on two more ongoing publications. They began publishing The Menomonee Falls Guardian, which reprinted humor strips, and took over (from Paul Levitz) the comics news fanzine The Comic Reader, which had been founded in 1961. To raise money, Street Enterprises produced artists' portfolios in 1975 and 1976, but by 1976, the duo were living in their parents' basements.

It is one of just a handful churches in the country and one of only two Protestant churches, the other one being Chilgol Church. Bongsu Church was originally constructed in 1988 and was the first church built in the country during communist rule. The church was relocated to a larger building in around 2008 and now offers seats for 1,200 persons. It is debated whether the attendance consists of genuine Christians in the country or not, but service has been observed by visiting foreigners. History The original Bongsu Church was built in September 1988. At the time, it was the first church built in North Korea after the Korean War, during which all churches in the North were destroyed, and the first one built during communist rule as well. It was opened just ahead of the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students that was held in Pyongyang. The church was built to showcase freedom of religion in North Korea, amid international pressure concerning the issue. The construction cost half a million won (250,000 dollars) and was funded by Christians from overseas. Until the 1990s, there was no Christian cross on top of the church. One was added when visiting foreign Christians pointed out the omission. The church has since been rebuilt and relocated in 2008, for a price of four billion won (4.3 million dollars), paid entirely by the South Korean Presbyterian Church Association. In 1992, when Kang Yong-sop, who acted as the chairman of the Korean Christian Federation, oversaw the church, Billy Graham paid a visit there to preach. Graham preached at the church again in 1994. Billy's son, Franklin preached in 2000 and 2008. Billy Graham's wife Ruth has also made a public speech at the church. Other visiting preachers include South Korean Han Sang-ryeol, who visited in 2010 without the authorization of the South Korean government. Operation The church seats 1,200 persons. Service takes place at 10 am every Sunday. Sometimes tourists have arrived only to find the church closed at that time. Others report that the sermons consist of political rhetoric. Whether or not the local congregation are authentic believers has been debated. South Korean pastor Soh Kyung-suk describes his observations during visits: \\"There were little signs of spontaneity during a service. I also found no child in attendance and no Bible study groups there, and we were even banned from talking to North Korean service participants ... What was most startling was that church officials didn't even know any hymns at all.\\" Bradley K. Martin, author of Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader, also described his visit to the church. The congregation sang \\"Jesus Loves Me\\" and many seemed to know it by heart. Preaching and prayer were on political themes such as Korean reunification and nuclear non-proliferation. Churchgoers, according to Martin, were not Workers' Party of Korea members and all of them had removed their Kim Il-sung lapel pins. \\"This church is a sacred place. We call it the 'house of heaven'. That is why political symbols are not allowed\\", a church employee explained. The church is Protestant, but no denomination is specified. It is overseen by the Korean Christian Federation. The congregation was about 300 strong on Sundays before the church was enlarged due to increase in attendance. Now the church seats 1,200 persons. The building has three stories. The church is staffed by a head minister, a vicar, eight elders, five deacons and fourteen deaconesses. The church runs a theological seminary for 12 people, in a separate building in the premises. The church has an associated noodle factory, which is supported financially by the Presbyterian Church of the United States, and a bakery.

This pattern was first described as a technique by Victor Porton. This pattern comes under concurrency patterns. Comparison with aspect-oriented implementation As an alternative to the aspect-oriented implementation of mutual properties, property binding can be proposed. In LibPropC++ C++ library it is implemented too. Some weakness in the LibPropC++ (with property binding): # Its use is not transparent as it requires to be declared necessary object attributes as properties and appropriate accessor methods must be provided # Binding of attributes in LibPropC++ is not designed to replace method calls # The library does not maintain an interaction history. Implementation There are two types of binding. One-way binding should be applied when one of the properties is read-only. In other cases, two-way binding must be applied. Infinite loops can be eliminated by blocking the signal, or comparing the assigned value with the property value before assignment, or eliminating unnecessary assignments. Binding properties of different types can be achieved through Type Conversions. Binding properties with transformations can be achieved through reducing the transformation function to the problem of binding properties, and the function can be imaginary consider as Type Conversions. Resulting context Properties are being kept synchronized automatically. Between library calls they always have the values expressed by the EqualityConstraints. Deficiencies Property changes watching mechanism acquires some resources. Sample Code Code sketch for one-way binding may look like as follows: bind_multiple_one_way(src_obj, src_prop, dst_objs[], dst_props[]) { for (i, j) in (dst_objs, dst_props) { bind_properties_one_way(src_obj, src_prop, i, j); } } Two-way binding can be expressed as follows (in C++): // In this pseudo- code are not taken into the account initial values assignments bind_two_way(prop1, prop2) { bind(prop1, prop2); bind(prop2, prop1); } Accomplishing the binding (i.e. connecting the property change notification in an event handler) may be like as follows: on_property_change(src_prop, dst_prop) { block_signal(src_obj, on_property_change); dst_prop := src_prop; unblock_signal(src_obj, on_property_change); } See also *Software design pattern References Category:Software design patterns ","title":"Binding properties pattern"},{"id":"49330030","text":"Zeona is an extinct town in Perkins County, in the U.S. state of South Dakota.

Zou was known for developing Shenghuo Zhoukan (Life Magazine) into a pioneering journal of political reporting and social commentary, and for his participation in the National Salvation Movement that mobilized opposition to the Nationalist Government and demanded stronger resistance to Japan's expansion. He was one of the so-called \\"Seven Gentlemen\\" who were arrested in 1936 and then freed in July 1937 on the eve of the Second Sino-Japanese War. During the war Zou worked in Communist held areas. He died in Shanghai, July 1944, and was granted posthumous Chinese Communist Party membership in September of that year. Early life and career Zou was born in Fuzhou, Fujian province in 1895 as the eldest of six children. His father was a minor official who struggled to support the family. His mother did sewing, taking in orders from women for festival clothes, and making shoes for the children. She died when Zou was twelve. His father wanted Zou to study engineering, and sent him to Nan Yang College in Shanghai, but in 1919 Zou transferred to St. John's University, where he majored in English. Although he wanted to become a journalist, his first jobs after graduation were teaching English, then director of the editorial board of the China Vocational Education Society (‰∏≠ËèØËÅ∑Ê•≠ÊïôËÇ≤Á§æ), headed by Huang Yanpei. In 1926 Zou became editor of the society's journal, Shenghuo zhoukan (Life Weekly) and changed its mission from vocational education to political reporting and social criticism. The Vocational Society's target was young men who wanted to take advantage of schooling but often could not afford a university education and feared that they would not be able to enter a secure professional life. Zou, in the words of a recent historian, \\"turned out to be one of those legendary editors who found out just what made their readerships laugh, cry, and most importantly, come back the following week for more.\\" Zou showed this talent for connecting with lower middle-class and working-class readers in the magazine's advice column, \\"The Readers' Mailbox\\" (Duzhe xinxiang), in which he gave advice on work, love, and politics. Readers addressed him simply as \\"Taofen\\" and his answers were both liberal in embracing progress and realistic in explaining the limited options a young woman had in the face of sexual harassment or discrimination, and the obstacles young men had in finding satisfying work in China's changing economy. The magazine featured popular stories on modern heroes such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Mohandas Gandhi, and Mustafa Kemal. Zou also embraced his success as a successful commercial entrepreneur and wrote enthusiastically about foreign business geniuses, such as George Eastman, who showed that capitalism could strengthen a nation. One of his first successes was a 1926 three-part series on Thomas A. Edison that described how this unschooled boy worked his way out of poverty into great wealth by hard work and struggle. The magazine increased in circulation under Zou's editorship from 2,800 in 1925 to 80,000 in 1930, and became a forum for political discussion and social debate. The Japanese invasion and takeover of Manchuria in September 1931 galvanized criticism of the government. Zou used his magazine not only as a forum to urge the Nationalist Government offer stronger resistance but to launch a campaign to raise money for armies that were more resolute. These included Ma Zhanshan's troops in Manchuria and the independent-minded 19th Route Army in Fujian, which would stage a rebellion in 1934. The circulation of Zou's magazine grew to 155,000, but when the government began to crack down on opposition figures, Zou left China for Europe. He departed just as the government decided to close his magazine in December 1933. Zou's journey took him through Europe, then to the Soviet Union, where he attended a summer session at Moscow University, and finally to the United States, where he traveled May through July 1935. Travels in the United States and the Soviet Union Zou was impressed that the United States \\"has the material basis for making people happy\\" and with the \\"bountiful food and clothing\\". But overall he was critical. He reported as a correspondent to his Chinese readers that \\"the average American is like a child; he has to have a new toy to play with, whether it is Radio City or a mahjong set, and like a child as well, he quickly tires of playing with it. The average American always has to have fun, and this fun is somewhat different from pleasure and even more different from true happiness\\". The treatment of African-Americans deeply shocked him. After several weeks spent in Birmingham and Selma, Alabama, he commented on \\"how strong the narcotic poison of the ruling class in the American South is.\\" He gained the confidence of a group of young progressives who had been organizing black factory workers; they had been seized by secret agents hired by the boss, taken outside of town and beaten, then turned over to the police, who put them in jail for a month. \\"I was astonished,\\" he wrote for his audience in China, \\"that such things could happen in a country supposedly under the rule of law.\\" In a series of articles he filed from abroad during his travels, he made clear that he had been more inspired by the Soviet Union than by Western Europe or the United States. After he returned to Shanghai in August, 1935, he started a new weekly journal, Dazong shenghuo (Life of the masses), which announced that its mission was \\"achievement of national liberation, eradication of feudal remnants, and suppression of individualism.\\" The National Salvation Front, the Seven Gentlemen, and the United Front Released Prisoners, Suzhou July 31, 1936 (Wang Zaoshi, Shi Liang, Zhang Naiqi, Shen Junru, Sha Qianli, Li Gongbu, and Zou Taofen) The National Salvation Movement was a loose coalition of leftist groups, including both open and secret members of the Chinese Communist Party. Leaders included Li Gongpu; Shen Junru; Tao Xingzhi; Shi Liang, one of the first women lawyers; Wang Zaoshi, Zhang Naiqi, and even Chiang Kai-shek's sister-in-law, Song Qingling. In August 1936, they published a letter calling upon Mao Zedong to \\"demonstrate sincerity in uniting all parties and factions in fighting the Japanese and saving the nation\\". They urged him to cease attacks on the central government in order to open negotiations and to give lenient treatment to landlords, rich peasants, and merchants. Mao replied favorably, saying that the declaration and program of the Salvation Front \\"represent the opinions and demands of the majority of the Chinese people who are unwilling to become slaves without a country.\\"Mao Zedong, \\"A Letter to Zhang Naiqi, Tao Xingzhi, Zou Taofen, Shen Junru, and all Members of the National Salvation Association,\\" in Stuart R. Schram, ed., Mao's Road to Power: Revolutionary Writings, 1912-1949 (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 1999) p 299. On November 23, 1936, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the arrest of the Salvation League's most important leaders, including Zou. They became known in the press as the \\"Seven Gentlemen\\" (‰∏ÉÂêõÂ≠ê Qi Junzi). The historian Parks Coble remarks that their \\"crime\\" was \\"advocating resisting Japanese imperialism\\". Their arrest created publicity and support for their positions both within China and abroad. John Dewey and Albert Einstein cabled Chiang's government in Nanjing as part of a global anti-fascist movement that urged their release. Song Qingling demanded that since their \\"crime\\" was patriotism, she was also guilty and should be arrested along with all other patriots. Chiang remained steadfast against what he saw as premature and useless defiance of Japan. In July 1937, however, he appeared to decide that he was ready for military action, and released Zou and his colleagues. Popular support for Chiang reached new heights when war broke out in August. After his release, Zou went to see Chiang Kai-shek in person, and when the Japanese army took Shanghai in the fall, Zou and the Salvationists called for resistance rather than retreat. In spite of tenacious defense, the Battle of Shanghai was a military disaster. Zou and the Salvationists saw the proud defense as the start of the final battle. However, these efforts did not protect his publishing house, Shenghuo shudian, from being shut down and its employees imprisoned as part of a general government effort to neutralize dissent. Zou continued to campaign for freedom of the press, though without success. When the national capital was moved inland to Chongqing, Zou continued his attacks on Chiang, then moved to the relative safety of Hong Kong, which he was forced to leave when the Japanese took the city in December 1941. Since he would not be welcomed in Chongqing, he first stayed in a village on the Guangdong-Guanxi border, then for a time with the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu. Although he suffered from a painful infection in his ear, he lectured widely and continued his activities in the communist held areas. By the end of 1942, however, while keeping an upbeat tone in his publications, Zou realized that the initial stages of optimistic unity had ended, that the Nationalist government was using terrorist repression, and that the common people were not necessarily well-informed or enthusiastic about fighting Japan. In March 1943, it was found that he had cancer of the ear. Zou returned to Shanghai, where he continued to write in support of the United Front, promote establishment of democratic government, and urge expansion of mass education. As death grew near, he gathered his family and a few friends to share his political testament. He wrote that he had three wishes: that his body be dissected at a hospital; that it then be cremated and the ashes sent to Yan'an, the wartime communist headquarters; and that he be made a member of the Party. He died July 24, 1944, and was granted party membership September 28. Family Zou was twice married. After his first wife died two years after their wedding, in 1926 Zou married Shen Cuizhen. They had two sons: Zou Jiahua (October 1926 - )Zou Jiahua, in Biographical Dictionary of the People's Republic of China, Song Yuwu, ed., (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2013), p. 431-432. and Zou Jingmeng (ÈÇπÁ´ûËíô; 1929‚Äì1999), and a daughter, Zou Jiali (ÈÇπÂòâÈ™ä). Zou Jiahua stayed on in the New Fourth Army district after his father left for Shanghai in 1944. He joined the Party and became a construction officer and engineer. After 1949, he rose steadily, although receiving criticism as a rightist during the Cultural Revolution.

This is a scented variety of rice grown mostly by the members of the tribal communities of in Panamaram, Sultan Bathery, and Mananthavady areas in Wayanad. As of 2010, Gandhkasala is cultivated in an area of 327 hectares and Jeerakasala in 22 hectares. Gandhakasala is one of two varieties of scented rice cultivated in Wayanad the other one being Jeerakasala rice. Both varieties have been identified as having potential to compete with the well known varieties of scented rice like Basmati rice and Jasmine rice. Because of the disease resistant properties, high nutritional value, fine taste and cooking properties, this variety of rice is traditionally used in special occasions like wedding feasts. Characterization MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) has characterized this variety of rice in terms of descriptors developed by National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) and International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI). More than 40 descriptors have been used in this characterization. The Community Agrobiodiversity Center in Kalpetta, Wayanad, established by MSSRF has actively been involved in efforts to conserve these specialty varieties of rice since 1997. Certification as Farmers' Varieties The paddy seeds of Gandhakasala, along with Jeerakasala and four more varieties, were given certification as Farmers‚Äô Varieties under the provisions of the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers‚Äô Rights Authority, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. This was made possible due to the efforts of SEED CARE, an association of traditional paddy cultivators of Wayanad, under the guidance of MSSRF‚Äôs Community Agro- biodiversity Centre. Nationally, this certification has been given to 545 varieties so far, but the Wayanad rice varieties are unique as certification is under the category of that given to a \\"farming community\\".

This was due to the joint efforts of Kerala Agricultural University and Wayanad Zilla Nellulpadaka Karshaka Samithi. It was the agro-ecological conditions, the methods of organic cultivation, traditional genetic make-up of cultivars, and unique processing technologies that has produced the specific aroma and flavour of Jeerakasala and Gandhakasala rice varieties.

The direct continuation of Smallegade, it initially runs west, from Nordre Fasanvej, but then turns south along the east side of Damhus Lake to meet Roskildevej. There is a large sports complex on the south end of the street with the football club F.C. Copenhagen's training facilities as well as the multi-purpose venue K.B. Hallen. History Peter Bangs Vej with Diakonissestiftelsen A field track referred to as Klammerivejen (literally Vrewl Road) followed the same route from at least 1755. It is probably older since documents from 1688 mentions \\"Clammerijs Agre\\". A popular but unverifiable explanation of the name is that the road was too narrow for two carriages to pass and that it was therefore liable to cause disputes. The track was the direct continuation of the Gammel Kongevej road which connected Copenhagen's Western City Gate to the village of Solbjerg, whose village pond can still be seen on the south side of Smallegade. Peter Bangs Vej in 1913 The road received its current name on 8 October 1868. It was named after the politician Peter Georg Bang who had recently died. The first major building along the road was Diakonissestiftelsen's hospital from 1876. The old West Line crossed the road just east of present-day Lindevangs All√©. In 1914, the road was regulated and a tram line to Vanl√∏se was inaugurated on 8 December that same year. Several large factories were built in the area between Peter Bangs Vej and Finsensvej in the 1900s and 1910s, such as Fisker & Nielsen's factory from 1913. The company both manufactured their Nilfisk vacuum cleaners and their Nimbus motorcycles at the site. Kj√∏benhavns Boldklub, Copenhagen's first ball-playing club, acquired a 6 hectares site on the south side of Peter Bangs Vej in 1924. The club inaugurated a large new sports complex at the site on 10 April 1928. Notable buildings and residents Danish Union of Librarians' building Diakonissestiftelsen seen from Peter Bangs Vej Diakonissestiftelsen's old main building (No. 1) is from 1876 and was designed by Hans J√∏rgen Holm in the style of a Medieval convent. The Deaconess Foundation has launched a 2020 plan for a comprehensive redevelopment of their site with residences as well as social and healthcare facilities. The building Sarepta designed by Carl Lendorf (No. 8) and Teba (No. 10), both from the 1880s and located on the other side of the street, were also built of Diakonissestiftelsen. They have now been converted into the daycare Marthag√•rden with a distinctive modern extension by Landager Arkitekter in 2013‚Äì14. To the rear of the two buildings stands the Postmodern, round headquarters of the Danish Union of Librarians. It was designed by Knud Munk. White Houses on a side street to Peter Bangs Vej The White Houses, situated a little further out, is a building society development originally built for workers at Frederiksberg Gasworks in the 1890s. The architect was Gotfred Tvede. Lindevang Church (No. 69) is from 1825 to 1830 and was designed by Thomas Havning and Anton Frederiksen. Fisker & Nielsen's former factory site was redeveloped between 2002 and 2008 and is now known as Nimbusparken (Peter Bangs Vej 30/ H. V. Nyholms Vej). It contains a mixture of residential and commercial buildings and reuses some of the old industrial buildings. The Danish Association of Masters and PhDs is based in the building directly on the street (No. 30). No. 147: K.B. Hallen Kj√∏benhavns Boldklub's extensive sports complex at Peter Bangs Vej is the primary training grounds of F.C. Copenhagen. The site also included the listed multi-purpose venue K.B. Hallen venue from 1938 but it was destroyed in a fire in 2011. Christensen & Co has won a competition to build a new KB-Hallen to a new design inspired by the old building. Parks and open spaces Several green spaces are located along the street. Lindevangsparken is located just north of the park. It was created and 1932 and has an area of 33,000 square metres, making it the largest and oldest municipal park in Frederiksberg. The much larger and older Frederiksberg Park and S√∏ndermarken are state-owned. The Damhus Lake and adjoining Damhus Meadow in Vanl√∏se is located just west of the street.

In 2011, the GPO netted a profit of 1.6 billion baht from the sale of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. As of 2011, the GPO employed 2,812 persons. In 2016, the organization produced drugs at two government-owned factories. GPO makes and sells four categories of products: medicines; antiretrovirals; chemicals/test kits/natural products; and preventive medicines. Besides Thailand, it markets its products in Nigeria, Ghana, Bhutan, Somalia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The GPO gives Thailand significant leverage in its price negotiations with foreign drug suppliers. , GPO's chairman is Dr Sopon Mekthon, who took over from Dr Nopporn Cheanklin. Missions GPO's mission statement contains four objectives. One of them is to \\"To maintain price level of pharmaceutical products and medical supplies necessary for the Thai society to ensure people's accessibility.\\" As an example, GPO will produce the antiretroviral drug efavirenz after receiving WHO approval. GPO's product costs 180 baht per bottle of thirty 600 mg tablets. The imported version retails for more than 1,000 baht per bottle. GPO will devote 2.5 percent of its manufacturing capacity to make 42 million efavirenz pills in 2018, allowing it to serve export markets as well as domestic. The Philippines alone will order about 300,000 bottles of efavirenz for 51 million baht. Compulsory licensing The GPO is permitted to produce efavirenz and two other patented medications by having sought compulsory licensing (CL) under the provisions of the WTO agreement on intellectual property, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs). Under a compulsory license, an individual or company seeking to use another's intellectual property can do so‚Äîfor good reasons‚Äîwithout seeking the rights holder's consent, and pays the rights holder a set fee for the license. This is an exception to the general rule under intellectual property laws that the intellectual property owner enjoys exclusive rights that it may license‚Äîor decline to license‚Äîto others. In the case of efavirenz, the patent owner, Merck, and the US Trade Representative, for years fiercely resisted allowing the GPO to produce the drug. Products =Sidegra= * Sidegra (Sildenafil) in 50 and 100 mg tablets. =Medical marijuana= GPO produces cannabinoid medicines at its factory in Pathum Thani Province, where it also grows cannabis plants. The organisation is also seeking approval to build a three billion baht, 1,500 rai (240 hectare), herb and marijuana facility in Chonburi Province. The GPO led an effort to convince the military government to approve marijuana research so that the GPO can market it for medical use. The move would make Thailand the first country in Asia to legalize medical cannabis. Dr. Nopporn Cheanklin, Managing Director of the GPO, said that, \\"The best strains of cannabis in the world 20 years ago were from Thailand, and now Canada has developed this strain..., we can't claim that ours is the best in the world anymore,...That's why we must develop our strain to...compete with theirs.\\" The government's cabinet of ministers in May 2018 gave the green light to amend the country's drug laws to allow research on medicinal marijuana. The bill is currently being debated in the National Legislative Assembly. Current Thai laws are tough on both the sale and use of marijuana. Possession of cannabis in Thailand could land its owner in jail for up to 15 years as the plant is a category-5 narcotic drug along with psychoactive mushrooms and kratom, a psychoactive plant similar to opiates that is native to Thailand. A researcher at Chulalongkorn University has pointed out that Thailand has 200,000 Alzheimer's patients and 150,000 Parkinson's patients who could benefit from medical marijuana.

San Francisco Chronicle.  Background  LOT started as a Canon, Google and Red Hat-led initiative in 2014, and its founding members were mostly technology companies. Companies from other industries such as finance and automotive have joined the network to protect themselves from the growing threat of PAEs. As of July 2020, LOT Network had more than 750 members and close to 2.5 million patent assets. Notable members of LOT include Google, Red Hat, Uber, Ford, Dropbox, Mazda, General Motors, Honda, CBS, Netflix, JPMorgan Chase, SAP, Microsoft, Tesla, Alibaba, the Wikimedia Foundation, and IBM. The number of patent disputes in the U.S. peaked in 2015, reaching 7,500 cases. According to Unified Patents, two-thirds of these cases were filed by patent trolls. A study out of Boston University found that patent litigation results in direct losses of about $60 billion every year in the U.S.  Underlying agreement  LOT members agree to mutual non-aggression pact in which they pledge that none of their patents will ever be used by a patent troll to sue another member; however, members can still sell patents and sue other members. Cross-licensing of LOT member patents is subject to certain \\"triggering\\" events. A triggering event takes place when a patent passes to a PAE, including scenarios in which a LOT company becomes a PAE or is absorbed by a PAE. After the triggering event, the specific patents involved in the event are automatically cross- licensed to all LOT companies, blocking any potential legal action by a PAE. By pooling their patents, member companies provide immunity to one another and deter potential lawsuits from patent trolls. The group also benefits from a network effect: the more members that join, the more attractive membership becomes for other companies. LOT members pay an annual fee for network membership. The annual fee depends on company revenues, but ranges from $1,500 to $20,000 per year (about the price of a single patent application). On September 1, 2016 LOT announced that it would waive annual membership fees until March 1, 2017 for companies with less than $5 million in annual revenues. This fee structure facilitates membership for startups and smaller companies, which are also targeted by PAEs. Over half of companies sued by PAEs make less than $10 million in revenue. In the event that a larger LOT member acquires a smaller member, the acquired company can pass on its patent license rights to its acquirer.  Reception  While LOT helps prevent patent trolling, it does not address low patent quality or hinder companies that attack competitors to stall progress and gain a competitive advantage. Daniel Nazer, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation praised LOT but added a note of caution: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a targeted program that‚Äôs good for limiting the supply of patents to the very worst actors who use litigation to shake down people for settlements, but it doesn‚Äôt stop problems with patent quality and with operating companies attacking each other.‚Äù The Electronic Frontier Foundation alleges that, ultimately, the patent system must be reformed to ensure that the U.S. Patent Office only grants patents for genuine inventions. Intellectual Ventures, a well known PAE, alleges that by buying patents they create a market for invention, thereby helping to revitalize inefficient companies and make innovation profitable. Others, including Ira Blumberg ‚Äì a former Rambus (a well-known PAE) employee ‚Äì have countered that any value created by patent trolls is outweighed by settlement costs.

It follows his earlier works on Jesus the Jew. Synopsis =1. Charismatic Judaism from Moses to Jesus= Vermes surveys the notion of Charismatic Judaism which he introduced in his 1973 book Jesus the Jew. Although Judaism was centred on adherence to the Torah, charismatic prophets such as Elijah, Elisha and Isaiah were also an important part of Jewish life and this continued with the Essene Teacher of Righteousness, Jesus ben Sira and Hanina ben Dosa, many of whom were miracle workers. =2. The Charismatic Religion of Jesus= Jesus entered the public domain as a follower and disciple of John the Baptist who he compared with Elijah. From the accounts in the synoptic gospels, Jesus emerges as a highly popular itinerant spiritual healer, exorcist and preacher. The most important part of his message was the imminent onset of the Kingdom of God which occurs about one hundred times in the synoptic gospels and remains important in the letters of Paul but almost entirely disappears from the Gospel of John, which was written later. His emphasis was situated between the apocalyptic imagery of a final cosmic battle and the rabbinic hope for a restored earthly kingdom of Israel. Though he calls God his Father, this was common in Judaism and his teaching stays within the scope of the Torah, though his stress on a childlike trust in God is unique. =3. Nascent Charismatic Christianity= The picture supplied in some of the letters of Paul, together with those of James and John and the Didache provide an earlier picture than the Acts of the Apostles. The early church was characterised by faith healing, manifestations of the Spirit and the breaking of bread, also known as the love feast and taught the Kingdom of God, the crucified risen and glorified Messiah and the imminence of his Second Coming, though the urgency of the Parousia declined as the century progressed. It reflects traditional Judaism in the light of Messianic faith. =4. The Christianity of Paul= The synoptic gospels show Jesus as a teacher divinely appointed to deliver a message, but Paul's Christ is the very object of the message. Paul's view of Christ's death as a redemptive act which saved the world from sin brings the idea of the Adam's primeval sin affecting everyone into the Jewish tradition for the first time. Baptism isn't simply a sign of repentance and cleansing but an identification with the death and resurrection of Jesus. He still held to the idea that Jesus would return to establish the Kingdom within the lifetime of people then living. However the status of Christ was not firmly established. Although he referred to the Son of God and Son of the Father, Jesus is seen as subordinate to God and isolated texts (e.g. Phil 2:6-11) are not representative and may not be original. =5. Johannine Christianity= The Jesus of the Fourth Gospel has little in common with the popular preacher familiar from the Synoptic Gospel tradition. There is little emphasis on the Kingdom of Heaven, few if any parables and Jesus is lordly, transcendent and authoritarian. He is not an ordinary human being but a mysterious otherworldly personality. Though traditionally associated with the Apostle John, the unknown author of the fourth gospel, probably writing in the first decade of the second century, had a strong Hellenistic background with knowledge of Philo of Alexandria and Hermeticism. This is shown most clearly in the first chapter which was probably composed after the rest of the gospel since its ideas are not referred to elsewhere. Jesus is portrayed as the Logos which emanates from God, the Son of God and the sacrificial Lamb of God, but he still claims \\"The Father is greater than I\\" (John 14:28). The Holy Spirit is personified in a new way, not seen in the other gospels, as the \\"other Counsellor\\" or \\"Advocate\\". =6. The Didache and Barnabas= A fuller introduction is given to the non-New Testament works which represent the doctrinal legacy of Christianity from about AD 100 to 325 as these are less well known. The Didache, or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, is the earliest text which portrays the common rules of the early church. It influenced later Church Orders though it was rejected for the New Testament. The emphasis is on rules for living rather than doctrine and Jesus is never identified as God, but rather the Servant of God. The anti-Jewish Epistle of Barnabas by contrast promotes a Johannine Logos-like Son who reveals God. =7. The Apostolic Fathers= The letters of Ignatius of Antioch (110 AD) were the first to declare the divinity of Jesus repeatedly and they criticize the Judaizers who still insisted that Christians should follow Jewish practices and the Docetists, who didn't believe Jesus was really human and opposed the idea of his suffering and death. The anonymous Letter to Diognetus uses the image of the Craftsman or Demiurge who God sent as the Servant. =8. Apologists and Theologians of the Second Century= Justin Martyr had been a sophist and thought Plato, not understanding the Jewish scripture, had talked of three gods. He offered various proofs that Jesus was the eternal logos. He accuses the Jews of murdering Christ in his Dialogue with Trypho, as did Melito of Sardis. Irenaeus of Lyons was the leading opponent of Gnosticism, challenging the dualistic Valentinus and Marcion in Against Heresies. He stressed the importance of the succession of bishops and the Eucharist. =9. Three Pillars of Wisdom= The greatest standard bearers of the third century were not bishops, all came from North Africa, lived under Roman persecution and are not proclaimed saints by the church. Tertullian was a lawyer who in opposing the Gnostics produced the first clear statement of Christ as both man and God, though he denied the perpetual virginity of Mary as favouring the Gnostics, and the co-eternity of the Son. But he joined a charismatic group, the Montanists, which was condemned by the Bishop of Rome. Clement of Alexandria stressed the need for real knowledge rather than the false knowledge of the Gnostics. Origen allegedly castrated himself in his teens to maintain his purity and went everywhere barefoot. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, some scholars have questioned the historicity of Origen's self- castration, with many seeing it as a wholesale fabrication.https://web.archive.org/web/20080608123250/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2008/2008-03-30.html His examination of the Old Testament produced the Hexapla comparing the original Hebrew and different Greek translations. He rebutted the Talmudic account of Jesus in Against Celsus but floundered in his support of the virgin birth. =10. Nicea: Eusebius of Caesarea, Arius and Constantine= The Council of Nicea happened soon after the Roman emperor Constantine had become the patron of Christianity in 312. It was triggered by a public disagreement between Alexander bishop of Alexandria and his presbyter Arius whose clear formulation of the relationship between Jesus and God, following the pattern of Origen and Eusebius of Caesarea, placed Jesus in an inferior position, seeing this as the only way to avoid formal polytheism. When Alexander excommunicated him, he sought the protection of Eusebius and Eusebius of Nicomedia who both had the ear of the emperor. Eventually Constantine invoked a council to settle what he considered \\"these small and very insignificant questions\\". Only some 200-300 bishops out of 1,800 invited came, almost exclusively from the Greek east. After an inconclusive debate, Alexander and his secretary Athanasius asserted that the son was of the same essence as the Father, that he was homoousios or consubstantial with God. This carried the council but the issue continued to be debated until Theodosius I made the profession of Arianism illegal in 381. =11. From Charisma to Dogma  A Bird's Eye View= The last chapter reviews the argument and concludes that the Council of Nicea could have ended very differently and that the ideas of consubstantiality and the equality of Jesus with God did not occur before then. It hopes that a new reformation will re-establish the charismatic message of Jesus. Reviews Rowan Williams, the ex-Archbishop of Canterbury: :Geza Vermes is the unchallenged doyen of scholarship in the English-speaking world on the Jewish literature of the age of Jesus, especially the Dead Sea Scrolls. In a series of deeply learned and lucid books, he has opened up the subject to non-specialist readers, offering some provocative and searching questions for Christian readers of their scriptures. In this book, he takes the story a little further forward, to trace the evolution of a distinctively Christian vocabulary up to and including the era when the first Christian creeds were being formulated. His subtitle flags up the climax of the story, at the Council of Nicaea in 325, when what he describes as a \\"revolutionary new formula\\" was agreed ‚Äì thanks largely to pressure from a Roman emperor newly sympathetic to the Christian faith, and as eager as any contemporary politician to make it serve the cause of social cohesion... There is an assumption that the basic alteration is a matter of turning the faith that Jesus himself held into a faith about him... This is a beautiful and magisterial book; but it leaves unsolved some of the puzzles that still make readers of the New Testament pause to ask what really is the right, the truthful, way to talk about a figure like the Jesus we meet in these texts. Stuart Kelly: :The career of Geza Vermes...is best known for his ground- breaking work on the texts found at Qumran, better known as the Dead Sea Scrolls. This book represents the summation of his thinking about the early history of Christianity. It is a challenging and engaging book that sets out to retrace the route by which a Jewish preacher in 1st-century Israel came to be declared as consubstantial and co-equal with the omnipotent, omniscient only God. Vermes‚Äôs argument is summed up in the title he takes for the conclusion: ‚Äúfrom charisma to dogma‚Äù. How did the flesh and blood Jesus become the metaphysical Christ Pantocrator? Karen Armstrong: :Over the course of his long, distinguished career, Geza Vermes, the first professor of Jewish Studies at Oxford university, has made a major contribution to our understanding of the historical Jesus. In Christian Beginnings, as in his groundbreaking work Jesus the Jew (1973), he shows that Jesus would have been a recognisable and familiar figure to his contemporaries. A healer, exorcist and compelling preacher, he was the latest in a line of charismatic prophets who existed for centuries alongside the established priestly tradition and offered an alternative form of Judaism, based on vision, ecstasy and miraculous healing, and frequently in conflict with the Israelite ruling class. :In this book, however, Vermes takes the story further, showing how the human figure of Jesus became increasingly other-worldly until, at the Council of Nicaea in 325, he was declared fully divine.

She was accompanied by the Indonesian recording artist Hetty Koes Endang, and Singaporean recording artist Ramli Sarip. The concert was a continuation of her 2010 concert project, Konsert Satu Suara. Unlike the previous installment of the concert where she and her company served as a guest artist and organizer respectively, Nuhaliza was the main singer for Konsert Satu Suara, Vol. 2. Although this concert served as a replacement for an eight-day musical theater about her life which was postponed, it was a success. Tickets sold days before the concert, and she and her supporting acts received positive reviews from critics for their vocals and showmanship. In December 2015, with an attendance of 2500 people, the two-night concert was recognized as the highest-grossing locally produced concert at Istana Budaya when it grossed more than RM 650,000 from the sale of tickets alone. Background and development Konsert Satu Suara, Vol. 2 was announced in October 2015 and staged in November 2015. It was Siti's contingency plan for the planned eight- day \\"bio-musical\\" theater about her life, which was postponed. The news of the postponement came to light in September 2015 when Siti was asked about its progress in an interview. On 5 October, she held a press conference at Istana Budaya to announce the news of Konsert Satu Suara, Vol. 2, her two-day concert with Hetty Koes Endang and Ramli Sarip which was to be held on 7 and 8 November at Istana Budaya. Citing the lack of sponsorship and financial constraints, she stated that the two-day concert was planned to take place as a replacement show for the same dates and venue that were rendered vacant upon the postponement of the originally planned theater. She commented on the situation, \\"Honestly [I am] not too disappointed when our first plan did not come to fruition. This is because we have been trying [to get a sponsorship] until late September but, unfortunately, the situation is not on our side. What [I am] sure is that there is a hikmah in all of these. Maybe I will be more prepared for the musical concert later.\\" Upon realizing that she and her company had to call off the theater in September, Siti only had two months to reschedule another performance to fill the vacant dates and venue. Although the concert was initially a contingency plan, both Hetty and Ramli agreed to perform with Siti for the two-day concert after she had come up with a single concept, following a single phone call to each of them. On why Hetty was chosen as one of the supporting acts, Siti explained, \\"I‚Äôve always admired Hetty. In fact, I grew up appreciating her music and I still fall under the spell of her angelic and soulful voice. [...] Getting her to join me on a stage for the first time is a dream come true and I‚Äôm so looking forward to our big day.\\" As for Ramli, Siti commented, \\"He is our finest rocker and his music is full of love, passion, and soul. It‚Äôs always an honour to collaborate with him as we are both perfectionists who love great music from the heart.\\" According to Siti, both guest stars, whom she considered legends, were the right choices given the fact that their vocals and showmanship are still \\"on point,\\" even if they were both over fifty years of age. Preparation for the concert also included a meeting between three of them. In choosing suitable songs to perform, Siti first had to envision how both of her guests would perform the chosen songs. This concert also marked the first time these artists shared the stage for a concert. Konsert Satu Suara, Vol. 2 was the second installment of the Konsert Satu Suara series to be organized by Siti's company, Siti Nurhaliza Productions, with a cost of RM 500 000. The first concert, organized in 2010, also took place at Istana Budaya. Unlike the first concert, where Siti was only a guest star for a concert by Aizat Amdan and Faizal Tahir, the second time around she took the center stage while being accompanied by two guests. The two-hour concert, featuring over 20 songs, had Aubrey Suwito as the musical director. All three artists performed a solo, duet, and trio. Most of the songs performed over the two nights of the concert were taken from their own compositions. Performances =Fashion and stage= Siti's makeup on the first night of the concert was provided by Deqsha, while on the second night it was applied by Epie Temerloh. Her wardrobe for both nights was provided by four local designers ‚Äì Rizman Ruzaini, Ezuwan Ismail, Faizel Azraf and Qudyn. =Concert synopsis= Siti Nurhaliza performing the opening song, \\"Sendiri\\", for the second night of the concert The two-hour concert began with an opening performance by Siti. She performed \\"Sendiri\\", one of the songs from her album Adiwarna, which she rarely performs live. It was followed by a performance of one of the singles from her 2013 album, Fragmen, \\"Terbaik Bagimu\\". In the next performance, she recalled the moment when she was still a shy young girl who was too scared to perform in front of a crowd. What she usually did was to sing in front of a mirror all by herself to the singing styles of Hetty Koes Endang. After the brief recollection, she performed \\"Hati Lebur Jadi Debu\\", a song by Hetty, who was also the next performer. Hetty began by performing two songs she is famous for; \\"Hadirlah Kasih\\" and \\"Kasih\\". During the performance of \\"Hadirlah Kasih\\", Hetty even riffed an air guitar while performing the song. A usually \\"melancholic ballad\\", \\"Kasih\\" was given a bossa nova touch for the two nights of the concert. Siti Nurhaliza with Ramli Sarip and Hetty Koes Endang performing \\"Lagu Rindu\\", the second last song for the second night of the concert. In the next part of the show, Siti returned to perform a medley of two other songs that she rarely performs live: \\"Bicara Manis Menghiris Kalbu\\" and \\"Kesilapanku Keegoanmu\\". The next four songs, \\"Bukan Cinta Biasa\\", \\"Pastikan\\", \\"Pedihnya Rasa\\", and \\"Rindu\\", were sung as duets by Siti and Hetty. \\"Bukan Cinta Biasa\\" was reworked to resemble traditional Malay music and keroncong. Siti then sang \\"Kamelia\\", a song made famous by Ramli Sarip. However, she changed the name from \\"Kamelia\\" to \\"Khalid Jiwa\\", the name of her husband. Before inviting Ramli to the stage, she recalled an incident when she was saved by Ramli when she almost fell into a pool of mud after a heavy downpour. Adding details to the story, Ramli also recalled the same incident when he signaled few men who were near Siti at that time not to touch her. The duo later performed \\"Dialah di Hati\\", \\"Teratai\\", \\"Doa Buat Kekasih\\" and \\"It Takes Two\\". Accompanied by a guest saxophonist, Jari, Ramli took the stage with his own solo performance of \\"Jikalau Berkasih\\" and \\"Budaya\\". After Ramli left the stage for his wardrobe change, Siti and Hetty performed a medley of \\"Kuda Hitam\\" and \\"Berdiri Bulu Romaku\\". For the final two songs of the night, Ramli joined Siti and Hetty on the stage to perform of \\"Lagu Rindu\\" and \\"Temasya Desa Gemalai\\". Critical response Overall, the concert received positive reviews from critics and reviewers. A number of critics questioned whether the collaboration would be successful, given that many of Siti's fans were relatively young, and unfamiliar with the songs of Ramli and Hetty. Izwan Mohd Isa of Kosmo commented, \\"Before the concert begins, there was a moment in my heart, why can't Siti alone lead the concert as a solo? Surely she will lead [the concert] flawlessly. However, [after watching the concert], those early doubts have to be cast far away.\\" The vocal performances of all three artists received positive reviews from the critics. Siti was praised for her vocal ability and dexterity. According to a reviewer from Utusan Malaysia, her vocals were able \\"to cause the body hair to stand on their ends\\", while \\"her spoken material was amusing and she sang like a prized songbird effortlessly\\" according to Deric Etc. of Daily Seni. She was also praised for her ability to sing other artists' songs as her own. Ramlah Zainal of Harian Metro praised Ramli's vocals as \\"solid\\" and \\"unchanged\\" while Deric praised his voice as \\"booming, raspy vocals\\". Reviewers agreed that although Hetty was 58 during the concert, she showcased memorable performances. Deric Etc. of Daily Seni commented, \\"At the age of 58, Hetty Koes Endang had the entirety of Istana Budaya eating out of her hand. Her charisma, energy and sense of humour shone brighter than ever; Hetty launched Konsert Satu Suara into the stratosphere last Sunday night.\\" He also added \\"Showcasing pipes of steel, the veteran singer‚Äôs voice has gained an impressive strength after all these years.\\" His comments were echoed by other reviewers. A reviewer from Utusan Malaysia commented, \\"Yes, her energy at the age of 58 is so impressive and her aura is so potent up to the point of every performance of hers was given a standing ovation [by the audience] and can be praised as a spectacular performance.\\" Arif Nizam Abdullah of Malaysia Gazette commented that watching a duet between Siti and Hetty was like watching \\"a vocal showdown\\". He also added, at certain points of the concert, it was hard to discern to whom the notes belong, especially during the parts in the higher register. According to him, Siti personally acknowledged that she was blown away by Hetty during the concert. Many critics stated that the vocal comparisons were unfair, given how the artists differed in term of voice and experience. Zaidi Mohamad of Berita Harian stated \\"[...] this performance is not about a vocal war or their influences, on the contrary, all three figures have emphasized that they are united in the name of music. There was no questions on who is better or who can belts songs with high registers, because they are all [here] to entertain their beloved fans.\\" The choice of songs received mixed reviews. Deric Etc. of Daily Seni commented that the songs performed were mostly \\"downtempo love songs\\" with \\"barely any upbeat numbers to help perk up sleepy audience members.\\" Shazryn Mohd. Faizal of The Rakyat Post, on the other hand, preferred the duet between Ramli and Siti with the song \\"It Takes Two\\" was replaced with a more memorable duet song. Kamaruddin Razal of Murai, however, said that the duet of \\"It Takes Two\\" further showcased Siti's versatility as a multi-talented entertainer. Critics, however, praised the new arrangements for many of the songs that were performed during the two days of the concert. Most of the reviewers and critics agreed that the concert, though it began as a contingency plan, left an immense impact. and generally was a success. Deric Etc. of Daily Seni concluded his review with \\"This writer, who went to Istana Budaya merely to watch Siti Nurhaliza, ended the night with newfound interest for Malay music of the seventies, eighties and nineties. Now, if only we can get more young Malaysians to watch this sort of thing.\\" Set list Siti Nurhaliza being interviewed by MeleTOP right after the final night of the show. # \\"Sendiri\\" # \\"Terbaik Bagimu\\" # \\"Hati Lebur Jadi Debu\\" # \\"Hadirlah Kasih\\" # \\"Kasih\\" # First Medley ## \\"Bicara Manis Menghiris Kalbu\\" ## \\"Kesilapanku Keegoanmu\\" # Second Medley ## \\"Bukan Cinta Biasa\\" ## \\"Pastikan\\" # Third Medley ## \\"Pedihnya Rasa\\" ## \\"Rindu\\" # \\"Kamelia\\" # Fourth Medley ## \\"Dialah di Hati\\" ## \\"Teratai Bunga Indah\\" # \\"Doa Buat Kekasih\\" # \\"It Takes Two\\" # \\"Jikalau Berkasih\\" # \\"Budaya\\" # Fifth Medley ## \\"Kuda Hitam\\" ## \\"Berdiri Bulu Romaku\\" # \\"Lagu Rindu\\" # \\"Temasya Desa Gemalai\\" Source: Adapted from concert's press release.Siti Nurhaliza Productions (2015) \\"Konsert Satu Suara, Vol. 2 (Press Release) Siti Nurhaliza Productions.

He released further records under the label African Songs Ltd before starting his own label Siky-Oluyole Records. Among the LP's released under African songs is Bisimilahi (1977) and Ile Aiye Dun Pupo/Love In Tokyo (India Sound) (1976). By the early 1980s, Ayinde Barrister and Fuji music had become accepted by all religions in the country. He went on to record various albums including Iwa (1982), Nigeria (1983), Fuji Garbage (1988) and New Fuji Garbage (1993) under his imprint. He had a popular record titled Reality (2004).

Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 5 Feb. 2016 =Musical Style= His Fuji Music is a blend of earlier traditional musical genres of Apala, Sakara, Awurebe and others. With Fuji Music, Barrister revolutionized traditional Yoruba music while still projecting traditional values of good behaviour, respect for elders and the struggles against life's forces. He often used his music as a tool of commentary on issues of national concern, especially, politics. He was blessed in the art of praising enigmatic individuals. =Awards= Dr. Sikiru Ayinde Barrister earned so many notable awards during his lifetime and music career however the most significant is the conferment of the honor of Member Of The Order Of Niger (MON) by the then President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2006, President Olusegun Aremu Obasanjo. The honour is believed to be based on his album Precaution released in 1995, the record that detailed the whole issues confronting Nigeria as a nation and possible solutions to the National problems.

Poirer and Connor write that it was first formed 1940 in the Baltic Special Military District and became the 28th Guards Rifle Division on 3 May 1942. The division briefly became the 14th Rifle Division in 1955, then 88th Motor Rifle Division 1957, but became 180th Kiev Red Banner Orders of Suvorov and Kutuzov Motor Rifle Division in 1965 and remained under that title until the 1990s. After 1992 became Ukrainian 27th Mechanized Brigade. The 27th Mechanized Brigade was disbanded, most likely in the early 2000s.  First formation  The 180th Rifle Division was first formed during August and September 1940 in the Baltic Special Military District. It was part of the 22nd Territorial Rifle Corps (Estonian) and was composed of Estonian People's Force personnel. It was commanded by Major General Richard Tomberg, the former commander of the Estonian Air Force. On 3 June 1941, Major General Ivan Missan replaced Tomberg in command. On 22 June 1941, it was based in V√µru, which was in the rear area. While moving forward, it was attacked by German aircraft. The division entered combat on 26 June against the LVI Panzer Corps, which was attacking the 27th Army in the Daugava region. On 9 July, the division and its parent formation, the 22nd Rifle Corps, were transferred from the 27th Army to the 11th Army. It fought in defensive battles, making counterattacks in Soltsy, Porkhov and Novorzhev. In August it had retreated back to the Staraya Russa area. In September 1941, the division fought in the Demyansk Defensive Operation. It then fought in the Demyansk Pocket in early 1942. On 3 May 1942, the division became the 28th Guards Rifle Division for its actions. Second formation The second formation of the division was created at Cherepovets in June 1942 from the 41st Rifle Brigade. It fought at Kiev, Targul Frumos, and Budapest.Poirer and Connor, Red Army Order of Battle The division was part of the 53rd Army of the 2nd Ukrainian Front in May 1945. During the war, the division was awarded the honorific Kiev for its actions during the 1943 capture of Kiev. It was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of Suvorov 2nd class and the Order of Kutuzov 2nd class.  Postwar  In 1955, it became the 14th Rifle Division. On 17 May 1957, the 88th Motor Rifle Division was activated from the 14th Rifle Division in Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, part of the 14th Army.Feskov et al 2013, p. 150 On 19 February 1962, the 276th Separate Equipment Maintenance and Recovery Battalion was activated along with the 244th Separate Missile Battalion. On 17 November 1964, the 88th Motor Rifle Division became the 180th Motor Rifle Division, restoring its World War II numbering. In 1967, the 14th Army became the 14th Guards Army. On 15 November 1972, the 1303rd Separate Anti-Tank Artillery Battalion was activated along with a separate Reactive Artillery Battalion. In 1980, the Separate Motor Transport Battalion became the 1041st Separate Material Supply Battalion. During the same year, the 136th Artillery Regiment absorbed the reactive artillery battalion. During the Cold War, the division was maintained at 16% strength. On 1 December 1989, the division was ordered to become the 5775th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base, but this was appears to have been delayed to at least 1991. In 1990, CFE treaty data showed the division had 61 T-64 tanks, 13 T-54 tanks and 12 BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers, among other equipment. In January 1992, the storage base was taken over by Ukraine. It became the 27th Separate Mechanized Brigade and was subordinated to the 1st Airmobile Division. The brigade was disbanded in 2004.

The pressure is typically generated pneumatically by compressed air or other gases (Nitrogen, Carbon dioxide, etc) or by electrical and magnetical fields or gravitation. Physical fundamentals It is known from thermodynamics that conjugated quantities scale in a different manner. Two classes can be distinguished: intensive quantities as temperature T, pressure P and amount of substance N or extensive quantities as entropy S, volume V and chemical potential Œº. Extensive quantities scale with system size, whereas the intensive ones do not. The quantity pressure, for example, is defined as the (differential) quotient of two extensive variables: p=dE/dV (Energy E und Volume V) and therefore scale independent as the same scaling factors appearing in the nominator as well as the denominator cancel. In microsystems the problem rises that the extremely small volumes are difficult to be controlled. The reason is the predominance of surface effects as surface charges, van-der-Waals forces and entropic effects (e.g. dewetting due to rough surfaces: the restriction in degrees of freedom of molecules penetrating such a surface is entropically more expensive than staying in bulk). Furthermore, the microsystem has to be controlled from a macroscopic human scale. References Category:Fluid dynamics ","title":"Pressure-driven flow"},{"id":"49331152","text":"Anna-Liisa Linkola.

The pair of monuments was built during the mid-Fifth Dynasty, likely during Nyuserre Ini's reign, for two female members of the extended royal family. Because of its unique architectural characteristics, such as the absence of mortuary temple, a funerary chapel located inside the monument superstructure and a north-south descending corridor to the burial chamber, the monument is seen as a distinct type of Ancient Egyptian tomb, called a \\"double pyramid\\" by the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner. This conclusion is debated, with the Egyptologist Du≈°an Magdolen arguing that it is simply a double mastaba.  Exploration  Location of Lepsius XXV in the necropolis of Abusir On his (1842‚Äì1845), the German archaeologist Karl Richard Lepsius located a small pyramid structure and included it in his list of pyramids as number XXV (25). Ludwig Borchardt classified it as a double mastaba in his research sixty years later, but he did not examine it any more closely. Since for a long time no intensive research was conducted, the structure was believed to be the pyramid of a queen of the 5th Dynasty, similar to Lepsius XXIV directly to the north, although preliminary investigations appeared to indicate that the funerary temple was located, unusually, on the western side of the structure.Miroslav Verner. Die Pyramiden. pp. 355 ff.: Die Pyramide ¬´Lepsius Nr. XXIV¬ª. A Czech archaeological team led by Miroslav Verner conducted the first intensive excavation between 2001 and 2004, in which the unusual character of the structure as a \\"Double pyramid\\" became clear. Both sections of the structure have a slightly rectangular base plan, oriented in a north-south direction with extremely steep sides, which make it impossible that the structure was ever a true pyramid. In the masonry, a relatively large number of building inscriptions and marks were found. These included the name of the structure, which can be translated as \\"the two [pyramids] are watchful.\\"Miroslav Verner: Du≈°an Magdolen questioned the classification of the building as a double pyramid and stressed the typological similarity of the remains to a mastaba.Du≈°an Magdolen. \\"Lepsius No. XXV: a problem of typology.\\" Asian and African Studies. 2008, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 205‚Äì223. Among the points raised by Magdolen is the observation that neither the eastern nor the western tomb has a square plan, when all Egyptian pyramids, with the exception of the earliest one, that of Djoser, have square bases. In addition Magdolen observes that the 78 degrees inclination of the walls of Lepsius XXV only falls within the normal range of mastabas and of step pyramids, while Lepsius XXV is clearly not the latter. Furthermore, some mastabas are known to have had a few architectural elements similar to those found in pyramids, in particular the north-south orientation of the descending corridor leading to the substructure as is the case here.  Eastern tomb (Lepsius XXV/1)  = Superstructure = The larger of the two tombs has a base measurement of 27.7 m x 21.53 m and is made of large blocks of white limestone. The outer walls, only roughly worked, had an incline of 78¬∞, which indicates that the structure either took the form of a mastaba or a pyramid base, rather than a true pyramid. The height cannot be determined. = Substructure = The entranceway to the tomb chamber is a descending passage from the middle of the north side of the structure. The chamber itself measures 4.5 m x 2.7 m and ia on a north-south orientation. The sarcophagus is located in a niche on the west side of the chamber. Although the chamber itself has been thoroughly stripped by grave robbers, remains of the burial could be found. In addition to parts of a woman's remains, fragments of her limestone canopic jars and grave goods were found in the rubble of the chamber.  West tomb (Lepsius XXV/2)  = Superstructure = The smaller, west tomb's base measures 21.7 x 15.7 m and also has an incline of 78¬∞. Thus, this portion appears also to have been a mastaba or truncated pyramid-like structure. Unlike the eastern tomb, the western one is made of roughly hewn grey limestone. It has experienced heavy spoliation, so that only a few layers remain today. The tomb probably did not ever have a cladding of fine white limestone. The stratification of the surviving masonry indicates that the west tomb was built after the eastern one. = Substructure = The underground structure of the western tomb has been thoroughly destroyed. Only the upper part of the descending passage, which was also on the north side, and the foundations of the tomb chamber survive now. This arrangement is typical for pyramids of this period. In the ruins of the tomb chamber, a very few traces of the burial of a woman were found, as well as a single object of the grave goods.  Tomb complex  The excavations were able to show that there was no mortuary temple in the complex. The area that had erroneously been identified as a mortuary temple, turned out to be further remnants of the western tomb. However, there was an offering chapel on the east side of the eastern tomb. This chapel hd an entrance on the southeastern corner which led through a vestibule to a single room. Part of the roof of the vestibule remains intact, so the height of the rooms of the chapel is known to have been about 5 metres. The chapel was originally clad with fine, white limestone, which was probably undecorated. This material has been almost entirely quarried away, but traces remain in the ground, from which the structure of the chapel could be reconstructed. In the ruins of the chapel, papyrus fragments of a list of offerings and an alabaster fragment of a female statue were found.  Context  Since no inscriptions have been found with the name of the owner of the pyramid, the unusual structure cannot yet be exactly dated, despite the intensive excavations which have now taken place. The suggestion that it was built during the reign of Nyuserre is based on its location at Abusir, which was abandoned as a royal necropolis after Nyuserre's death. It was likely built for members of the extended royal family. The presence of a fragmentary alabaster statue of a woman as well as of the remains of the mummy of a woman suggest that the monuments served to bury two women. The double nature of the tomb strongly indicates a particular closeness of the individuals buried.

It is the second deadliest road traffic collision in France's history after the 2016 Nice truck attack. 53 people died, including 46 children (44 on the coach and 2 in a car). Most of the victims were on board a coach that caught fire as a result of the collision. The coach passengers were from Cr√©py-en-Valois in the Oise d√©partement of Picardy, northern France. The accident At 8:00 pm on 31 July 1982, two coaches left Cr√©py-en-Valois, a town located approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of Paris. They were carrying children and their teachers heading to a summer camp in Aussois in Savoie, in the French Alps. In the middle of the night, the two coaches were on the A6, heading towards Lyon. When they passed Beaune, it was raining and traffic was heavy on a day that is known as samedi noir (\\"black Saturday\\") in France, as many people leave for their summer holidays on this day. At around 1:45 am, the general speed of traffic dropped due to the motorway becoming narrower, reducing from three lanes to two. Two cars, which were overtaking the two coaches at the point where the road narrowed, cut across behind one of the coaches and in front of the other. At the same time, the leading coach braked suddenly due to a slow- moving vehicle ahead. The second coach hit the back of the second car, causing a pile-up. The fuel tank of one of the cars was ripped open and emptied onto the road, and the petrol ignited. Six vehicles caught fire. The first coach was evacuated by the drivers and teachers. In the second coach, a side exit was blocked by a crashed car. Nevertheless, two teachers managed to let around 15 children out through the back of the vehicle, but 44 remained trapped inside along with two drivers and two teachers. In the two cars that were travelling between the coaches, a total of five people, including two children, were killed (there were no survivors in these two cars). After the accident Families were informed of the accident at 6 am. The names of the children who had died were announced by the mayor of Cr√©py-en-Valois at around 11 am, in alphabetical order. Few of the bodies were identifiable. The funerals took place in Cr√©py-en-Valois on 3 August 1982. French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand attended. The bodies that could not be identified were buried together under a large headstone in the cemetery in Cr√©py-en-Valois. Following a trial, the coach company‚Äôs contractor received a suspended 18-month prison sentence and a fine of 25,000 French francs. This was because the vehicle was found to have had seriously defective brakes. One of the drivers received a suspended 6-month prison sentence, his driving licence was suspended and he was fined 2,300 francs. The insurance company had to pay out 12 million francs to the victims‚Äô families. A memorial was erected in 1985 at a road-side rest area near Curney, in the commune of Merceuil, very close to the crash site. The child victims of the accident are buried in the cemetery in Cr√©py-en-Valois. The plaques feature their names, and some families lost several children. Marie-Andr√©e Martin ‚Äì who lost three children and had a fourth who was in the accident but survived ‚Äì created the Association des victimes de Beaune (‚ÄúBeaune Victims' Association‚Äù), which became a member of the F√©d√©ration nationale des victims d‚Äôaccidents collectifs (‚ÄúNational Federation for Victims of Public-Transport Accidents‚Äù). Each year since the accident, the town hall in Cr√©py-en-Valois has commemorated the tragedy on the anniversary date. Legislative consequences The Minister of Transport at the time, Charles Fiterman, reacted by implementing strict measures, which remain in place today. The maximum speed limit for coaches was reduced, while the speed limit for all vehicles in rainy conditions was reduced to 110 km/h (68 mph) on motorways and 80 km/h (50 mph) on other roads. Transporting groups of children is now forbidden during the busy weekends of late July and early August. All heavy vehicles (such as HGVs and coaches) must now be equipped with a mechanical speed-limitation device, and it is strictly forbidden for the user to tamper with or modify this device in any way. Furthermore, manufacturers of vehicles destined for public transportation must use non- combustible and non-toxic materials and must make the windscreen out of laminated glass.

It flowers in the summer and has yellow flowers on stems to about 30 cm high. Description Albuca shawii is a summer growing and winter dormant bulbous plant, flowering from September to February in its native habitat in southern Africa. It has narrow, somewhat fleshy leaves covered with short, slightly sticky hairs. The flower stems are around 30 cm tall and carry nodding flowers with tepals about 15 mm long, yellow with green stripes. The flowers are scented. Taxonomy Albuca shawii was first described by John Gilbert Baker in 1874. The specific epithet shawii commemorates the collector, named by Baker only as \\"Dr Shaw\\", and identified elsewhere as the Scottish botanist John Shaw. Baker placed the species in a new series within the genus Albuca, Leptostyla, noting both its long, thin style and the sterile outer stamens. Along with other species of Albuca, A. shawii has been placed in the genus Ornithogalum (as O. shawii), but molecular phylogenetic studies have supported the separation of the two genera. The species has been synonymized with Albuca tenuifolia, but this has been rejected. Distribution and habitat Albuca shawii is native to southern Africa (the Cape Provinces, Lesotho, KwaZulu- Natal, the Free State and the Northern Provinces).

It runs from Dresden-Klotzsche station on the G√∂rlitz‚ÄìDresden railway to Dresden Airport and today it is served exclusively by the Dresden S-Bahn.  History  The railway to Dresden Airport developed from a siding to the Air War School Klotzsche, which was finished in 1936. Its construction was started after the opening of the airport in Dresden in July 1935. A three kilometre-long railway siding, which had its terminus near the current Dresden-Nord interchange between the Autobahn 4 and the Autobahn 13, was built in 1934 to supply the area. The former railway siding was rebuilt as a railway with the establishment of the aviation industry in Dresden from 1955. A station was opened at Grenzstra√üe for the peak hour services to the Aircraft Works (Flugzeugwerke). The passenger trains running to meet the works‚Äô shift changes could also be used by the public from 1966. From 1972, double-deck push-pull trains operated to Dresden Grenzstra√üe to cope with the extensive commuter traffic for the first time. These trains mostly ran to and from Pirna, but some also ran to Altenberg. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, passenger numbers at Grenzstra√üe decreased greatly during the peak. At the same time, the redevelopment of Dresden Airport as a major regional airport started. This meant that the issue of an efficient transport connection to it was considered. In September 1997, planning began for the extension of the railway line to the new terminal, which was to be established in a former aircraft assembly plant north of the old terminal. The last passenger trains on the old line ran on 22 May 1998. Terminal 1 of the airport seen from the parking garage. The station is underground and directly in front of the building (2005) Construction began on connecting the airport to the S-Bahn network on 30 July 1998. The precast concrete tunnel was completed in the summer of 1999. A 200 m-long flying junction for traffic approaching the airport via the Dresden-G√∂rlitz railway was built at Dresden-Klotzsche station and a junction with two new electrified tracks was built for traffic to and from the airport. The total projected cost amounted to 84.3 million Deutsche Marks and was funded by the Free State of Saxony On 25 March 2001, the new line was opened simultaneously with new Terminal 1 at the airport. Until the completion of the Leipzig City Tunnel the Dresden Airport station was the only underground station in Saxony. Since its opening, the line has been operated as line S2 of the Dresden S-Bahn. Trains run every 30-minute intervals towards Dresden Hauptbahnhof and on weekdays continue to Heidenau and Pirna.  Development options Under the Dresden land-use plan that has been in force since the end of 1996, routes for both a connecting curve to the north of Dresden-Klotzsche station and an extension of the line towards Dresden Industriegel√§nde railway station to the southwest of the airport are reserved. If these plans are implemented, it would be possible, for example, for trains to continue to east Saxony without reversing at the airport. The zoning plan, also provided an option for the establishment of an additional station on the existing line near K√∂nigsbr√ºcker Landstra√üe to enable interchange. This would allow connections to Dresden tram line 7 at the Industriepark Klotzsche stop and urban and regional bus services. However, there are no concrete plans to implement these ideas.  Stations ; Dresden-Klotzsche Dresden-Klotzsche station (2011) Dresden-Klotzsche station was opened on the G√∂rlitz‚ÄìDresden railway in 1873 under the name of Klotzsche-K√∂nigswald. With the opening of the narrow-gauge railway to K√∂nigsbr√ºck in 1884, Klotzsche became a railway junction. The line was later converted to standard gauge. Dresden-Klotzsche station is now an important regional station in northern Dresden. Convenient transfer connections consist in particular from Regional-Express services from G√∂rlitz and Zittau to Dresden S-Bahn line 2 services and to buses. There are no longer any freight facilities. ;Dresden Grenzstra√üe Dresden Grenzstra√üe station is mainly used for handling traffic commuting to the nearby businesses. Two trains can cross at the station, although this rarely happens. In rare cases, the station acts as a terminus when the airport tunnel is blocked. ;Dresden Airport Dresden Airport station (2008) Dresden Airport station was the eighth airport station built in Germany and the first underground station in Saxony. It was opened on 25 March 2001. The station is located on the second basement level of the terminal (level -2) and is reached only from the terminal via two escalators. Like all stations newly built for the Dresden S-Bahn, it has a usable platform length of 140 metres; this is located on an island between the two terminating tracks.  Rolling stock The line was first operated (from 2001 to 2004) with low-floor diesel Siemens Desiro Classic railcars of class 642. It has since been operated with trains with double-deck carriages in push‚Äìpull mode and hauled by a class 143 electric locomotive. Only trains with emergency brake override are allowed to operate in the airport tunnel. A fire alarm system was also installed on the class 143 locomotives.

It was the first time in an official record that enlisting the support of Jews as a war measure was proposed. Background Palestine was first discussed at British Cabinet level on 9 November 1914, four days after Britain's declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. David Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the Exchequer \\"referred to the ultimate destiny of Palestine.\\"Grooves Of Change: A Book Of Memoirs Herbert SamuelBritain's Moment in the Middle East, 1914‚Äì1956, Elizabeth Monroe, p26 Lloyd George's law firm Lloyd George, Roberts and Co had been engaged a decade before by the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland to work on the Uganda Scheme.Conservative Party attitudes to Jews, 1900‚Äì1950, Harry Defries In a discussion after the meeting President of the Local Government Board Herbert Samuel, Lloyd George assured him that \\"he was very keen to see a Jewish state established in Palestine.\\" Samuel then outlined the Zionist position more fully in a conversation with Foreign Secretary Edward Grey. He spoke of Zionist aspirations for the establishment in Palestine of a Jewish state, and of the importance of its geographical position to the British Empire. Samuel's memoirs state: > I mentioned that two things would be essential‚Äîthat the state should be > neutralized, since it could not be large enough to defend itself, and that > the free access of Christian pilgrims should be guaranteed. ... I also said > it would be a great advantage if the remainder of Syria were annexed by > France, as it would be far better for the state to have a European power as > neighbour than the TurkSamuel, Grooves of Change, p174 The same evening, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith announced that the dismemberment of the Turkish Empire had become a war aim in a speech for the Lord Mayor's Banquet at the Mansion House, \\"It is the Ottoman Government, and not we who have rung the death knell of Ottoman dominion not only in Europe but in Asia.\\" Cabinet level discussions In December 1914 Samuel met Chaim Weizmann, who after the war was elected as the President of the World Zionist Organization, and later the first President of Israel. Samuel was then a member of the British Cabinet in his role as President of the Local Government Board. According to Weizmann's memoirs, Samuel was already an avid believer in Zionism, and believed that Weizmann's demands were too modest. Samuel did not want to enter into a detailed discussion of his plans, but mentioned that \\"perhaps the Temple may be rebuilt, as a symbol of Jewish unity, of course, in a modernised form\\". A case study says that recollections of Josiah Wedgwood confirm those of David Lloyd George (supported by the National Archives) that the first meeting between Lloyd George and Weizmann was in August 1915 while noting that several sources refer to a meeting in December 1914 or January 1915. (According to Schneer, on 15 January 1915, Weizmann and Samuel met at 11 Downing Street with Lloyd George but sources that to Weizmann's Trial and Error which gives the date as 3 December 1914.) At the end of January, Samuel forwarded the memorandum to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and Foreign Minister Edward Grey for approval. Lloyd George, who was later to be Prime Minister himself at the time of the Balfour Declaration, was noted by Asquith to be the only Cabinet member strongly in favour of the proposal. The memorandum The memorandum began by noting that the outbreak of World War I presented an opportunity for a change \\"in the status of Palestine\\". He noted that it would likely be too early for an independent Jewish state, and that incorporation into the British Empire would be the solution \\"which would be much the most welcome to the leaders and supporters of the Zionist movement throughout the world\\". The memorandum then set out five benefits to the British Empire of such a strategy. These were: :1. It would enable the country \\"to fulfil in yet another sphere her historic part of civiliser of the backward countries.\\"s:The Future of Palestine :2. It would raise the prestige of the British Empire :3. It would allow a positive outcome of the war for the British Empire without stripping Germany of her colonies and creating a war of revenge :4. It would improve the defences of Egypt, acting as a strong frontier :5. It \\"would win for England the lasting gratitude of the Jews throughout the world\\", including 2 million Jews in the United States The alternatives to British annexation were then considered. French annexation was considered \\"unwelcome to the Jews\\", Internationalisation would \\"lay the country under a dead hand\\", annexation to a Greater Egypt would introduce complications, and leaving the country to Turkey with guarantees for Jewish colonisation would likely leave the situation substantially unimproved. Samuel then concluded by noting that whilst a British Palestine would not alone solve the Jewish question in Europe, it would have an important effect upon \\"the character\\" of the world's Jews, thereby enriching the world. Samuel concluded by referencing a famous parliamentary speech given by Thomas Babington Macaulay in 1833Essay and speech on Jewish disabilities, published 1910 during the emancipation of British Jews > \\"Let a Jewish centre be established in Palestine; let it achieve, as I > believe it would achieve, a spiritual and intellectual greatness; and > insensibly, but inevitably, the character of the individual Jew, wherever he > might be, would be ennobled. The sordid associations which have attached to > the Jewish name would be sloughed off, and the value of the Jews as an > element in the civilisation of the European peoples would be enhanced. The > Jewish brain is a physiological product not to be despised. For fifteen > centuries the race produced in Palestine a constant succession of great men > ‚Äì statesmen and prophets, judges and soldiers. If a body be again given in > which its soul can lodge, it may again enrich the world. Till full scope is > granted, as Macaulay said in the House of Commons, \\"let us not presume to > say that there is no genius among the countrymen of Isaiah, no heroism among > the descendants of the Maccabees.\\" Reactions According to Friedman, the final March version (\\"as presumably also the January one\\") was not discussed in either Cabinet or the War Council. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith noted on January 28 about the first draft: and in March about the final version: Writing earlier on 5 February, Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading noted that \\"[Lloyd-George was] inclined to the sympathetic side ‚Äì your proposal appeals to the poetic and imaginative as well as to the romantic and religious qualities of his mind\\". Samuel's cousin and Anti-Zionist Edwin Montagu wrote a letter to Asquith on 16 March 1915: > \\"Palestine in itself offers little or no attraction to Great Britain from a > strategical or material point of view\\"...\\"[Palestine would be] incomparably > a poorer possession than, let us say, Meopotamia\\"...\\"I cannot see any Jews I > know tending olive trees or herding sheep\\"...\\"There is no Jewish race now as > a homogenous whole. It is quite obvious that the Jews in Great Britain are > as remote from the Jews in Morocco or the black Jews in Cochin as the > Christian Englishman is from the moor or the Hindoo\\"...\\"If only our peoples > would...take their place as non-conformists, then Zionism would obviously > die and Jews might find their way to esteem.\\" References  External references     * Category:Mandatory Palestine Category:History of Zionism Category:Documents of Mandatory Palestine Category:Aftermath of World War I in Turkey Category:1915 documents Category:Memoranda ","title":"The Future of Palestine"},{"id":"49331696","text":"Szandra Szombathelyi (born ) is a Hungarian female volleyball player, playing as an outside-spiker.

It airs on #0, the flagship TV channel of subscription platform Movistar+, and is Buenafuente's first program to air on pay television. History On September 2015 it was confirmed that Atresmedia had cancelled Andreu Buenafuente's show on laSexta, En el aire, after two seasons, which meant the host was no longer linked to the media group. Shortly afterward his signing for Movistar+ was announced, as the platform aimed to sign a roster of well-known presenters to launch #0. By December 2015 the first details of Buenafuente's show on Movistar+ were revealed: it would be named Late Motiv and the host would continue to count on former En el aire collaborators Berto Romero, Roberto Enr√≠quez (also known as \\"Bob Pop\\") and Javier Coronas, joined by comedian David Broncano and the actor Llimoo. During the second season, the cast was joined by Devon Knight, a fictional character played by Joaqu√≠n Reyes, who would do a weekly comedic news recap. In early 2018, Broncano left Late Motiv to focus on his own show, La Resistencia, which premiered on February 1. The two main novelties of the show were Buenafuente's return to the classic American late-night format, complete with a house band, and the host filming his show outside the Province of Barcelona for the first time ever, moving to Movistar+' studios in Madrid. Late Motiv premiered on Canal+ on January 11, 2016, three weeks before the station was discontinued for the launch of #0.

Several qualitatively different ways of coordinatizing the plane in hyperbolic geometry are used. This article tries to give an overview of several coordinate systems in use for the two- dimensional hyperbolic plane. In the descriptions below the constant Gaussian curvature of the plane is ‚àí1. Sinh, cosh and tanh are hyperbolic functions. Polar coordinate system  Points in the polar coordinate system with pole O and polar axis L. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees or . In blue, the point . The polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction. The reference point (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, or polar angle. From the hyperbolic law of cosines, we get that the distance between two points given in polar coordinates is :\\\\operatorname{dist} (\\\\langle r_1, \\\\theta_1 \\\\rangle, \\\\langle r_2, \\\\theta_2 \\\\rangle) = \\\\operatorname{arcosh} \\\\, \\\\left( \\\\cosh r_1 \\\\cosh r_2 - \\\\sinh r_1 \\\\sinh r_2 \\\\cos (\\\\theta_2 - \\\\theta_1) \\\\right) \\\\,. The corresponding metric tensor is: (\\\\mathrm{d} s)^2 = (\\\\mathrm{d} r)^2 + \\\\sinh^2 r \\\\, (\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\theta)^2 \\\\,. The straight lines are described by equations of the form : \\\\theta = \\\\theta_0 \\\\pm \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\quad \\\\text{ or } \\\\quad \\\\tanh r = \\\\tanh r_0 \\\\sec (\\\\theta - \\\\theta_0) where r0 and Œ∏0 are the coordinates of the nearest point on the line to the pole. Quadrant model system The Poincar√© half-plane model is closely related to a model of the hyperbolic plane in the quadrant Q = {(x,y): x > 0, y > 0}. For such a point the geometric mean v = \\\\sqrt {x y} and the hyperbolic angle u = \\\\ln \\\\sqrt {x/y} produce a point (u,v) in the upper half-plane. The hyperbolic metric in the quadrant depends on the Poincar√© half-plane metric. The motions of the Poincar√© model carry over to the quadrant; in particular the left or right shifts of the real axis correspond to hyperbolic rotations of the quadrant. Due to the study of ratios in physics and economics where the quadrant is the universe of discourse, its points are said to be located by hyperbolic coordinates. Cartesian-style coordinate systems  In hyperbolic geometry rectangles do not exist. The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral in hyperbolic geometry is always less than 4 right angles (see Lambert quadrilateral). Also in hyperbolic geometry there are no equidistant lines (see hypercycles). This all has influences on the coordinate systems. There are however different coordinate systems for hyperbolic plane geometry. All are based on choosing a real (non ideal) point (the Origin) on a chosen directed line (the x-axis) and after that many choices exist. =Axial coordinates = Axial coordinates xa and ya are found by constructing a y-axis perpendicular to the x-axis through the origin. Like in the Cartesian coordinate system, the coordinates are found by dropping perpendiculars from the point onto the x and y-axes. xa is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular on the x-axis to the origin (regarded as positive on one side and negative on the other); ya is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular on the y-axis to the origin. Circles about the origin in hyperbolic axial coordinates. Every point and most ideal points have axial coordinates, but not every pair of real numbers corresponds to a point. If \\\\tanh^2 (x_a) + \\\\tanh^2 (y_a) = 1 then P(x_a , y_a) is an ideal point. If \\\\tanh^2 (x_a) + \\\\tanh^2 (y_a) > 1 then P(x_a , y_a) is not a point at all. The distance of a point P(x_a , y_a) to the x-axis is \\\\operatorname {artanh} \\\\left( \\\\tanh(y_a) \\\\cosh(x_a) \\\\right) . To the y-axis it is \\\\operatorname{artanh} \\\\left( \\\\tanh(x_a) \\\\cosh(y_a) \\\\right) . The relationship of axial coordinates to polar coordinates (assuming the origin is the pole and that the positive x-axis is the polar axis) is : x = \\\\operatorname {artanh} \\\\, (\\\\tanh r \\\\cos \\\\theta) : y = \\\\operatorname {artanh} \\\\, (\\\\tanh r \\\\sin \\\\theta) : r = \\\\operatorname {artanh} \\\\, (\\\\sqrt{\\\\tanh^2 x + \\\\tanh^2 y} \\\\, ) : \\\\theta = 2 \\\\operatorname {arctan} \\\\, \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\tanh y}{\\\\tanh x + \\\\sqrt{\\\\tanh^2 x + \\\\tanh^2 y} } \\\\right) \\\\,. =Lobachevsky coordinates= The Lobachevsky coordinates x‚Ñì and y‚Ñì are found by dropping a perpendicular onto the x-axis. x‚Ñì is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular to the x-axis to the origin (positive on one side and negative on the other, the same as in axial coordinates). y‚Ñì is the distance along the perpendicular of the given point to its foot (positive on one side and negative on the other). : x_l = x_a \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\tanh(y_l) = \\\\tanh(y_a) \\\\cosh(x_a) \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\tanh(y_a) = \\\\frac{\\\\tanh(y_l)}{\\\\cosh(x_l)} . The Lobachevsky coordinates are useful for integration for length of curves and area between lines and curves. Lobachevsky coordinates are named after Nikolai Lobachevsky one of the discoverers of hyperbolic geometry. Circles about the origin of radius 1, 5 and 10 in the Lobachevsky hyperbolic coordinates. Circles about the points (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) and (0,3) of radius 3.5 in the Lobachevsky hyperbolic coordinates. Construct a Cartesian-like coordinate system as follows. Choose a line (the x-axis) in the hyperbolic plane (with a standardized curvature of -1) and label the points on it by their distance from an origin (x=0) point on the x-axis (positive on one side and negative on the other). For any point in the plane, one can define coordinates x and y by dropping a perpendicular onto the x-axis. x will be the label of the foot of the perpendicular. y will be the distance along the perpendicular of the given point from its foot (positive on one side and negative on the other). Then the distance between two such points will be :\\\\operatorname{dist} (\\\\langle x_1, y_1 \\\\rangle, \\\\langle x_2, y_2 \\\\rangle) = \\\\operatorname{arcosh} \\\\left( \\\\cosh y_1 \\\\cosh (x_2 - x_1) \\\\cosh y_2 - \\\\sinh y_1 \\\\sinh y_2 \\\\right) \\\\,. This formula can be derived from the formulas about hyperbolic triangles. The corresponding metric tensor is: (\\\\mathrm{d} s)^2 = \\\\cosh^2 y \\\\, (\\\\mathrm{d} x)^2 + (\\\\mathrm{d} y)^2 . In this coordinate system, straight lines are either perpendicular to the x-axis (with equation x = a constant) or described by equations of the form : \\\\tanh y = A \\\\cosh x + B \\\\sinh x \\\\quad \\\\text{ when } \\\\quad A^2 < 1 + B^2 where A and B are real parameters which characterize the straight line. The relationship of Lobachevsky coordinates to polar coordinates (assuming the origin is the pole and that the positive x-axis is the polar axis) is : x = \\\\operatorname {artanh} \\\\, (\\\\tanh r \\\\cos \\\\theta) : y = \\\\operatorname {arsinh} \\\\, (\\\\sinh r \\\\sin \\\\theta) : r = \\\\operatorname {arcosh} \\\\, (\\\\cosh x \\\\cosh y) : \\\\theta = 2 \\\\operatorname {arctan} \\\\, \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\sinh y}{\\\\sinh x \\\\cosh y + \\\\sqrt{\\\\cosh^2 x \\\\cosh^2 y - 1} } \\\\right) \\\\,. =Horocycle-based coordinate system = Horocycle-based coordinate system Another coordinate system uses the distance from the point to the horocycle through the origin centered around \\\\Omega = (0, + \\\\infty ) and the arclength along this horocycle. Draw the horocycle hO through the origin centered at the ideal point \\\\Omega at the end of the x-axis. From point P draw the line p asymptotic to the x-axis to the right ideal point \\\\Omega . Ph is the intersection of line p and horocycle hO. The coordinate xh is the distance from P to Ph ‚Äì positive if P is between Ph and \\\\Omega , negative if Ph is between P and \\\\Omega . The coordinate yh is the arclength along horocycle hO from the origin to Ph. The distance between two points given in these coordinates is :\\\\operatorname{dist} (\\\\langle x_1, y_1 \\\\rangle, \\\\langle x_2, y_2 \\\\rangle) = \\\\operatorname{arcosh} ( \\\\cosh (x_2 - x_1) + \\\\tfrac12 (y_2 - y_1)^2 \\\\exp (- x_1 - x_2) ) \\\\,. The corresponding metric tensor is: (\\\\mathrm{d} s)^2 = (\\\\mathrm{d} x)^2 + \\\\exp (-2 x) \\\\, (\\\\mathrm{d} y)^2 \\\\,. The straight lines are described by equations of the form y = a constant or : x = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\ln ( \\\\exp (2 x_0) - (y - y_0)^2 ) where x0 and y0 are the coordinates of the point on the line nearest to the ideal point \\\\Omega (i.e. having the largest value of x on the line). Model-based coordinate systems  Model-based coordinate systems use one of the models of hyperbolic geometry and take the Euclidean coordinates inside the model as the hyperbolic coordinates. =Beltrami coordinates = The Beltrami coordinates of a point are the Euclidean coordinates of the point when the point is mapped in the Beltrami‚ÄìKlein model of the hyperbolic plane, the x-axis is mapped to the segment and the origin is mapped to the centre of the boundary circle. The following equations hold: : x_b = \\\\tanh (x_a), \\\\ y_b = \\\\tanh(y_a) =Poincar√© coordinates = The Poincar√© coordinates of a point are the Euclidean coordinates of the point when the point is mapped in the Poincar√© disk model of the hyperbolic plane, the x-axis is mapped to the segment and the origin is mapped to the centre of the boundary circle. The Poincar√© coordinates, in terms of the Beltrami coordinates, are: : x_p = \\\\frac{x_b}{1+\\\\sqrt{1 -x_b^2 - y_b^2 }}, \\\\ \\\\ y_p = \\\\frac{y_b}{1+\\\\sqrt{1 -x_b^2 - y_b^2 }} =Weierstrass coordinates = The Weierstrass coordinates of a point are the Euclidean coordinates of the point when the point is mapped in the hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic plane, the x-axis is mapped to the (half) hyperbola (t \\\\ , \\\\ 0 \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\sqrt{t^2+1} ) and the origin is mapped to the point (0,0,1). The point P with axial coordinates (xa, ya) is mapped to : \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\tanh x_a}{\\\\sqrt{1 -\\\\tanh^2 x_a - \\\\tanh^2 y_a }} \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\tanh y_a}{\\\\sqrt{1 -\\\\tanh^2 x_a - \\\\tanh^2 y_a }} \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 -\\\\tanh^2 x_a - \\\\tanh^2 y_a }} \\\\right) Others =Gyrovector coordinates= Gyrovector space =Hyperbolic barycentric coordinates= From Gyrovector space#triangle center The study of triangle centers traditionally is concerned with Euclidean geometry, but triangle centers can also be studied in hyperbolic geometry. Using gyrotrigonometry, expressions for trigonometric barycentric coordinates can be calculated that have the same form for both euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. In order for the expressions to coincide, the expressions must not encapsulate the specification of the anglesum being 180 degrees.Hyperbolic Barycentric Coordinates, Abraham A.

The company is headquartered in the United Kingdom with offices in Fitzrovia, London. The service is free to users and is currently available in London, Manchester, Brighton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow and Dublin.  History  MyLocalPitch was founded in January 2014 by Jamie Foale and Sandford Loudon after struggling to find and book sports pitches for their 11-a-side football team. The site started by listing London based sports venues before expanding into Dublin in March 2015. In November 2015, the MyLocalPitch iPhone App was released to market, allowing users to book and search for venues using geolocation. MyLocalPitch initiated its 'Outstanding London Sports Venue Award' in 2015 to recognise outstanding sports facilities for services provided and their role in the community. March's award was claimed by Westway Sport and Fitness and April's went to Playfootball Romford. As an extension of Sport England's new strategy to increase sports participation, MyLocalPitch has introduced bespoke borough pages to further speed up the booking process. A few examples can be seen for Islington, Hackney and St Albans. In April 2017 MyLocalPitch launched its second iOS app with new features including an interactive map, secure payments and a live bookings calendar. As 2017 drew to a close, MyLocalPitch signed as London FA's official Bookings Partner and for the Middlesex FA to grow participation numbers. At the start of 2018 MyLocalPitch became the first London-based SportsTech business to raise more than ¬£1 million and Graeme Le Saux joined the board of directors. In July, the Football Foundation, the largest sports charity in the UK, implemented MyLocalPitch's booking portal for community football venues. An Android app was launched in August 2018. MyLocalPitch rebranded as Playfinder in the summer of 2019.  Reception  The Daily Mirror listed MyLocalPitch as the best iOS app of 2018.  Company Expansion  Playfinder raised ¬£733,550 to reach 112 per cent of its crowdfunding target and take its overall funding to more than ¬£3.5 million following an earlier private equity raise of ¬£2.85m.

It was described by The Hollywood Reporter as an \\"effectively a well-mounted video diary of his short visit to the country\\" and \\"inevitably intriguing because of its subject\\". The film had its world premiere at the September 2015 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival, and was nominated for the award for Best Documentary Film at the 30th Goya Awards. Production Longoria was permitted to film high-quality footage within the country, his visit facilitated and monitored by Alejandro Cao de Ben√≥s, the Spanish founder of the Korean Friendship Association who himself becomes a subject of the documentary. The film, which includes interviews as well as archival and contemporary news footage, attempts to describe the nation's social realities with particular attention to media manipulation by the DPRK government, while also questioning the simplifications and caricatures about North Korea made by foreign observers. Longoria shot mainly in Pyongyang, including the Pyongyang Metro, the Munsu Water Park, the Mansudae Grand Monument and a mass in the Changchung Cathedral. There are also scenes in Panmunjom in the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Longoria told Variety that he had deliberately avoided \\"the typical moving handheld secret look at North Korea\\", and that he undertook, in the film's striking opening sequence, \\"to use 'propaganda' aesthetics\\" and \\"to shoot North Korea in a way that hasn‚Äôt been shown before: as beautiful as possible\\", with attention to Pyongyang residents enjoying leisurely activities in their city. \\"Most people say they‚Äôve never seen North Korea like that, which is surprising as we just shot what we were shown\\", Longoria said. The filmmaker, who readily admits that he is not an expert in North Korea, \\"decided to make information manipulation the underlying plot\\" of his film, and through the use of restrained commentary, to let viewers themselves decide what may or may not have been staged for his visit.

He made a comeback in 1975 and won the Irish Open that year, over Rhodesian player Tony Fawcett. During his career he also featured in the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open tournaments. He was John McEnroe's first ever opponent in a Grand Slam singles main draw. They met in the first round of the 1977 French Open and the American qualifier won the match in straight sets. At the same tournament, Gardiner partnered Paul McNamee in the men's doubles. He made the second round of the Australian Open twice, the last of which was in 1979, when he lost to eventual champion Guillermo Vilas.

He lived in Paris, France.  Life  Douglas MacDiarmid was born in Taihape, in the middle of the North Island of New Zealand, the younger son of Gordon Napier MacDiarmid, country general medical practitioner and surgeon (and former army surgeon on SS Maheno), and his wife Mary Frances (n√©e Tolme), a schoolteacher before her marriage. He was born in his family home upstairs from his father's surgery at 24 Huia Street, Taihape. He boarded at Huntley School in Marton, and Timaru Boys' High School, then studied literature, languages, music and philosophy at Canterbury University College. His studies were interrupted by World War II military service in the army and air force at home. Although he had no formal art training, he was mentored by older members of The Group, an avant-garde set redefining New Zealand art and culture that he was closely involved with during his Christchurch years from 1940 to 1946. While his brother Ronald Diarmid MacDiarmid (1920‚Äì2013) followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a doctor, Douglas left New Zealand after the war in 1946 to find his way as an artist, teaching and painting in London and France. After a year back in New Zealand in 1949‚Äì50, he returned to France and was based there for the rest of his life, with homeland exhibitions and regular trips back to New Zealand. MacDiarmid was a cousin of the New Zealand scientist Alan MacDiarmid, one of three recipients of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2000. The following year, Douglas painted a portrait of his cousin for the New Zealand Portrait Gallery collection. His childhood home is now a bed and breakfast called Magpie Manor at 24 Huia Street, Taihape.  Career  From 1952, MacDiarmid was a full-time artist in Paris. He also wrote poetry. Not confined to a style, he created landscapes, cityscapes, portraits, figures, abstract and semi-abstract forms, many inspired by his extensive travels, and exhibited successfully in France, London, Athens, New York, and Casablanca. In 1990, MacDiarmid was brought back to New Zealand for the country's sesquicentennial celebrations, and declared a New Zealand living cultural treasure by the government of the day. His portrait was painted by Jacqueline Fahey at the time for the new New Zealand Portrait Gallery. MacDiarmid painted the portraits of Rita Angus and Theo Schoon among others. His paintings are owned by French and New Zealand governments, the City of Paris, and public and private collections across the world, including New Zealand, Australia, the United States, France, England, Greece, Switzerland, Morocco, South Africa, China, South America, Korea, and Tahiti, as well as the collection of the late Duke and Duchess of Windsor. In 2016, two of his paintings sold through Art+Object for a record price (for the artist) of more than $27,000 each as part of the Tim and Sherrah Francis Collection, the highest grossing art auction in New Zealand history. A series of MacDiarmid's line drawings were used to illustrate a little volume of poems by New Zealand Poet Laureate 2015‚Äì2017 C. K. Stead. Published by the Alexander Turnbull Library, the signed, limited edition book was titled In the mirror, and dancing (2017) and hand-pressed by Brendan O'Brien. The book was launched on 8 August 2017 in Wellington, with the assistance of Gregory O'Brien to celebrate the conclusion of Stead's laureateship. Senior art historian Associate Professor Leonard Bell, of the School of Humanities at the University of Auckland, noted MacDiarmid's name missing in overviews of the history of painting in New Zealand and has welcomed the launch of his biography Colours of a Life - the life and times of Douglas MacDiarmid by Anna Cahill (2018).

Structure It employed around 1,300 people in six factories in the late 1940s. It was situated on Camberwell Road (A215 road) in Camberwell, near the junction with the B214, between Walworth (to the north) and Camberwell (to the south) on the western edge of Burgess Park, now part of the London Borough of Southwark. There was a factory in Highbury, together with the head office in Camden Town and a small factory situated between Margate and Ramsgate in Kent. These locations were primarily \\"Hilger\\" products, whereas Camberwell was primarily Watts products.

Amongst other devices, the Camden location produced PDP-8 computer-driven X-ray diffractometers in the mid-late 1960s, one of which is believed to be still functional at Oxford University Chemistry Dept. in 2017. Development began with a linear diffractometerArndt, U. W. and Phillips, D. C. (1961) Acta Cryst. 14, 807-818 in the late 1950s - early 1960s but this was superseded around 1965 by the Y290, a four-circle diffractometer,Arndt, U. W. (1963) Hilger, J. 8, 2-11. the electronics for which were developed at the University of Manchester by Prof David B.G. Edwards (Computer Science)Edwards, David (Dai).

(2007) IUCr Commission on Crystallographic Computing Newsletter 8, 5-12. The early models (actually referenced Y230) used a Ferranti computer for controlling the diffractometer but, due to reliability issues, the cheaper and more compact PDP-8 became the computer of choice for the Y290 model. One of the production engineers claimed that the electronic research department in Camden (headed by Arthur Long) had PDP-8 No 4 from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), so Hilger and Watts was likely to have been one of the first PDP-8 customers. The book ‚ÄòSingle Crystal Diffractometry‚ÄôArndt, U. W. and Willis, B. T. M. (1966) ‚ÄòSingle Crystal Diffractometry‚Äô, Cambridge University Press. by U.W. Arndt and B.T.M. Willis (C.U.P., 1966) has photographs and other excellent diagrams showing the construction of these machines; both authors were involved in their development. The four-circle diffractometer was originally designed for neutron work at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment Harwell Laboratory but it became better known in field of X-ray crystallography. Photographs showing prototypes of both instruments may be seen in a review article by U.W. Arndt.Arndt, U. W. (2001) Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 55(3), 457-72. For commercial production of the four-circle diffractometer, Hilger and Watts won two Queen's Awards to Industry, the first for Services to Export in 1966 and the second for Technological Achievement in 1968.Knapp, J. J., Swanton, M. J. and Jevons, F. R. (1970) ‚ÄòUniversity Perspectives‚Äô, Manchester University Press. In the late 1960s the cost of the four-circle system was around $130,000. The Y290 diffractometer had an optical motor-positioning system based on moir√© fringes which were recorded by photocellsRudman, R. (1967) J. Chem. Ed. 44(6), A499-530.  sometimes the user would find that after centring their crystal under a bright light and forgetting to turn it off, the diffractometer motors would completely lose their settings. The correct positioning could be restored by a command which returned the motors to built- in datum points. In fact, the motors were regularly driven back to datum during data collection as a check on their positioning. The X-ray data were written to paper tape and, by the mid-1980s, users were struggling to find computer facilities which could still read their tapes for downstream analysis. At the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, University of Oxford, a 5-circle version of the machine was developed for protein crystallography which could measure up to five X-ray reflections in each scan due to the addition of a tiltable linear array of 5 counters to the detector arm.Banner, D. W., Evans, P. R., Marsh, D. J. & Phillips, D. C. (1977) J. Appl. Cryst. 10, 45-51.

Its summit offers a sweeping panorama to the north because no other higher mountains impede the view. To the south, by contrast, the view is restricted by higher summits in the Stubai Alps. The first well known ascent took place on 23 August 1881 by Ludwig Purtscheller accompanied by chamois hunter Franz Schnaiter from Zirl.  Location and surrounding area  The Zwieselbacher Rosskogel is situated in the area of three high valleys: north of the summit is the Kraspes valley (Kraspestal) and, to the east, is the Gleirsch valley (Gleischtal), both side valleys of the Sellrain. To the west of the mountain lies the Zwiselbach valley (Zwiselbachtal), a side valley of the Horlach valley (Horlachtal), which, in turn, opens at Niederthai into the √ñtztal valley. From the crest that runs from north to south separating the Zwieselbach and Gleirsch valleys, a side ridge branches off at the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel in a northeasterly direction on which another three-thousander rises just under one kilometre away, the Rotgrubenspitze (3,040 m). On the ridge north of the summit are the peaks of the Weitkarspitzen (up to 2,947 m) and the Kraspesspitze (2,954 m). On the prominent ar√™te to the south at a distance of about 750 metres is another striking peak, the Gleirscher Rosskogel (2,994 m). Nestling between the ridges that head north and northeast is the small glacier, the Kraspesferner, which had an area of 0.69 km¬≤ in 1969, but which has been badly affected by glacial retreat.  Ascent options  A waymarked mountain path runs over the plateau- like col immediately north of the summit between the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel and Weitkarspitzen. This path serves as a crossing from the Schweinfurter Hut in the west and the New Pforzheim Hut in the east. From this saddle the somewhat lower north top (about 3,070 m), which bears the summit cross, may be reached in just a few minutes. The equally very short crossing from the north summit to the slightly higher south top requires some easy climbing. From either hut one needs about 3 hours in order to gain the summit. Another varied option is an ascent along the southern ar√™te from the col of Gleirscher J√∂chl (2,750 m) via the Gleirscher Rosskogel. It was on this route that the first climbers, Purtscheller and Schnaiter, reached the top. The most difficult section of the ridge, especially the steep step immediately south of the main peak was made safer in 2010 by members of the Pforzheim Branch of the Alpine Club by the installation of appropriate climbing aids. In addition, th route is marked as the Via Mandani throughout. In spite of the climbing aids the ar√™te, which is rather exposed in places, requires grade II climbing on the UIAA scale. The Zwieselbacher Rosskogel is very popular as a ski tour and there are numerous routes. It is usually approached from the north, from Haggen through the Krapses valley.

Background and release Tobias Forge claimed that \\"Year Zero\\" and \\"Zenith\\" are the only two Ghost songs that he was not the main author of, the two songs instead being the ideas of guitarist Martin Persner. Although, Forge did write the former's lyrics in addition to revising, arranging and giving instrumentation to both.

Music video A music video for the song directed by Amir Chamdin was unveiled on March 25, 2013. A censored version was uploaded to YouTube two days later. Reception Loudwire referred to \\"Year Zero\\" as possibly the standout track of Infestissumam. About the song, Spin wrote that \\"Satanic- choir hooks flow into comparatively restrained, melodic verses that are somehow even more sinister.\\" Metal Forces called it one of the album's best with its \\"eerie chants that sound as if they‚Äôve been lifted from the local monastery\\" and its infectious drum beat.

Built sometime between 1928 and 1934, it was from 1941 until 1955 the summer home of Mary Ellen Chase (1887-1973), one of Maine's most important regional writers of the period. It was the inspiration for her bestselling work, Windswept. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history Windswept is located in southern Steuben, a coastal community of Down East Maine. It is on the west side of Petit Manan Point near its southern end, set on at Yellow Birch Point. The main house is a single story wood frame structure, consisting of two equal-sized gabled sections set parallel to each other and joined by a cross- gabled hyphen. The structure is oriented facing southwest, about from the shore, with views over grasses and low blueberry bushes to the Gulf of Maine and the Schoodic Peninsula. A low picket fence creates a courtyard between the wings east of the hyphen, and a wide deck extends across the western facade. The window shutters have pine tree cutouts, and the building exhibits restrained Colonial Revival symmetry. To the northeast of the house is a small barn with attached shed, both of uncertain date. The complex is sheltered to the east by a small copse of trees, through which its access drive passes. Windswept was built sometime between 1928 and 1934 by G. Horton Glover of Florida, and was part of an ultimately unsuccessful effort to develop Petit Manan Point as a summer destination. Mary Ellen Chase, a Maine native who was then a professor at Smith College and already a well-known regional writer, rented the cottage in 1940, and purchased it the following year. In 1941 her novel Windswept was published, and was an immediate success. Chase's biographers claim that some of her best writing took place here in the following years.

Physical characteristics Possible likeness of John Taverner from the Forrest-Heyther partbooks The treble, mean, contratenor, tenor and bass books are of identical appearance. They are bound in leather and the covers bear stamped images of the English royal coat of arms on one side, and a Tudor rose and a pomegranate on the other. The pomegranate was the symbol of Henry VIII's first wife Catherine of Aragon. John Bergsagel suggests that this shows the partbooks must have been bound before Henry and Catherine's divorce in 1533.Bergsagel (1963) 242 It is not known whose are the arms on the sexta pars book.Bergsagel (1963) 243 However, the paper used in this partbook also appears in another source which dates from 1531.Bergsagel (1963) 244 In the treble, mean, contratenor, tenor and bass books, the initial letters of the Missa Gloria tibi trinitas are decorated with a face and a banner bearing the name of John Taverner. It has been assumed that this is a likeness of the composer.Bergsagel (1963) 246 Copying history It is not known who copied Masses 1‚Äì11 in the collection. It has been suggested that these Masses were copied at Cardinal College (now Christ Church, Oxford).Bergsagel (1963) 246f. This college had been founded in 1525 by Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor. John Taverner was employed as Master of the Choristers at Cardinal College from 1527 until 1530, and it is possible that the partbooks were begun and bound at the college under his influence. Masses 12‚Äì18 are in the handwriting of William Forrest and an inscription in the contratenor book reveals that he owned all the books in 1530. At that time, Forrest was a petty canon of Cardinal College.Bergsagel (1963) 244f. It is not known exactly when he copied the Masses, however. The presence of music by Sheppard and a reference to Tye's doctorate in the collection suggests that they were not added until at least 1545.Bergsagel (1963) 247 It has been suggested that Forrest copied the Masses in the reign of Mary I of England, while acting as her personal chaplain. Forrest died in c. 1581, leaving the last four Masses incomplete. Forrest's copies of Masses 15‚Äì18 were completed by John Baldwin, a singing-man at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle and later a member of the English Chapel Royal.Bergsagel (1963) 245 Baldwin was a prolific copyist who also copied the Baldwin Partbooks (Oxford, Christ Church MS. Mus. 979‚Äì983), part of the Dow Partbooks (Oxford, Christ Church MS. Mus. 984‚Äì988), and My Ladye Nevells Booke. He probably had the sexta pars rebound in the 1590s.

Context Nott had been the chief cook for a string of aristocrats, named on the title page of his book as the Dukes of Somerset, Ormond, and Bolton, and the Lords Lansdown and Ashburnham. Book =Contents= The book describes how to make savoury dishes including \\"Bisks, Farces, forc'd Meats, Marinades, Olio's, Puptons, Ragoos, Sauces, Soops, Pottages\\". Pastries include biscuits, cakes, custards, puddings, pies and tarts. Confectionery includes candying and conserving flowers, fruits, and roots, as well as jellies, marmalades and decorative \\"sugar-works\\". Drinks include the making of beer, cider, mead, perry and English wines, as well as cordials. The book ends with a list of suggested bills of fare for every month of the year. The book is prefaced with a four-page Introduction \\"To All Good Housewives\\", beginning \\"Worthy Dames, Were it not for the sake of Custom, which has made it as unfashionable for a Book to come abroad without an Introduction, as for a Man to appear at Church without a Neckcloth, or a Lady without a Hoop-petticoat, I should not have troubled you with this.\\" The introduction ends with \\"Your humble Servant, The Compiler\\". There follows \\"Some Divertisements in Cookery, us'd at Festival-Times, as Twelfth-Day, &c.;\\" The main text is laid out as a dictionary from Al to Zest. It included items now unfamiliar, such as Battalia Pye of Fish, a \\"very large Pye, and cut with Battlements ... with as many Towers as will contain your several sorts of Fish\\", which included salmon, cockles, prawns, oysters, and periwinkles.

The entries are named, either like \\"Asparagus with Butter\\" as dishes, or like \\"To make an Amlet of Asparagus\\" as goals to be attained. The ingredients are not listed. Quantities, if mentioned at all, are simply included in the text, as \\"an Egg or two\\", relying on the cook's judgement as to the exact quantity needed. Cooking conditions are similarly mentioned only in passing, as \\"over a gentle Fire\\". For example: ::To make an Amlet of Asparagus :: Blanch your Asparagus, cut them in short Pieces, fry them in fresh Butter, with a little Parsley and Chibols ; then pur in some Cream, season them well, and let them boil over a gentle Fire: In the mean time make an Amlet with new laid Eggs, Cream, and Salt ; when it is enough, dress it on a Dish ; thicken the Asparagus with the Yolk of an Egg or two, turn the Asparagus on the Amlet, and serve it up hot.Nott, 1723, page 130. =Editions= * First edition, 1723, C.

The bibliographer William Carew Hazlitt, in his 1902 Old Cookery Books, considered Nott well-read and intelligent as he drew his recipes from many sources at home and abroad, including \\"to dress mutton the Turkish way\\". Nott's \\"Queen's Pottage\\" is recreated at The Gilbert Scott restaurant, though The Telegraph notes that the chef, Marcus Wareing, omits the original cockscombs. Nott's Salmagundy is likewise reworked by Heston Blumenthal in his Dinner restaurant. The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets notes that the \\"ubiquitous\\" cr√®me br√ªl√©e appeared in the Dictionary, but that Elizabeth David had traced Nott's version to Fran√ßois Massialot's recipe in his 1691 Cuisinier royal et bourgeois, rendered as \\"Burnt Cream\\" in the English translation of his book, The Court and Country Cook of 1702.

During the 1940s he became a political activist. In 1943 he was found guilty of preparing to commit high treason and condemned to death. Following the intervention of influential fellow-intellectuals the sentence was commuted to a five-year prison term in 1944. Life =Provenance and early years= Werner Krauss was the son of the archivist-scholar and his wife, born Ottilie Sch√ºle. Werner's mother's sister was the mother of Eberhard Koebel. In June 1918 Werner Krauss successfully completed his schooling at the Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium in Stuttgart, after which he was conscripted into the wartime army. Discharged from the army in 1919 Krauss went on to study Literary sciences at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and at what later became the Humboldt University of Berlin, with a particular focus on Romance studies. Between 1922 and 1926 he lived in Spain, studying at Madrid. For his doctorate he was supervised by Karl Vossler (who had also taught Victor Klemperer) at Munich for a study of daily life and literature in Medieval Spain, which was subsequently published. He moved to Marburg in April 1931, taking a post as an assistant at the university, and received his habilitation qualification a year later, this time for a piece of work entitled \\"The development of the bucolic in Spanish Literature\\", for which he was supervised by Erich Auerbach. Shortly after this politics intervened at the beginning of 1933 when the Nazi party took power and lost little time in imposing their version of a one-party dictatorship on Germany. Auerbach lost his post at Marburg because he was Jewish, and Krauss took over Auerbach's teaching responsibilities, which normally would have gone hand in hand with a professorship. However, in the case of Werner Krauss the teaching duties came without the professorship because he was believed by those in charge to be ideologically unreliable. =Nazi years= On 11 November 1933 a ceremony was held at the Albert Hall in Leipzig to celebrate the \\"National Socialist Revolution\\". As part of the celebration many mainstream academics (and others) signed a declaration of which the character can be inferred from the title: \\"With Adolf Hitler for the German People‚Äôs Honour, law and liberty\\" (\\"Mit Adolf Hitler f√ºr des deutschen Volkes Ehre, Freiheit und Recht!\\"). Werner Krauss was one of approximately 900 who signed it. War returned in 1939, and in August 1940 Krauss was conscripted into the army, ending up in a special company of simultaneous translators: this involved relocating to Berlin, although the work also included front-line assignments. In Berlin, through his friendship with the psychiatrist John Rittmeister Krauss came into contact with the resistance activist Harro Schulze-Boysen. Krauss and his girl friend, a student called Ursula Goetze, now participated in a \\"sticker campaign\\" against a high-profile exhibition being held in the Lustgarten park in May/June 1942 which carried the ironic title \\"The Soviet Paradise\\". This led to their identification as what the Gestapo termed Red Orchestra (\\"Rote Kapelle\\") members and Krauss was arrested in November 1942. On 18 January 1943 they were both found guilty as accessories to High treason by the National War Court and condemned to death. As well as the incident involving the \\"sticker campaign\\", Krauss was condemned under the Law on extraordinary broadcast actions (\\"Verordnung √ºber au√üerordentliche Rundfunkma√ünahmen\\") for having listened to, read and given publicity to \\"inflammatory articles\\" from abroad. In the end the death sentence was never carried out. Supported by \\"psychiatric assessments\\" and the advocacy of influential academics including Karl Vossler, Ernst Robert Curtius and Hans-Georg Gadamer, the death sentence was replaced with a five-year jail sentence on 14 September 1944. Ursula Goetze had been executed on 5 August 1943. By the time his sentence was commuted Krauss had spent twenty months awaiting execution, including a stretch in a death cell in Pl√∂tzensee Prison where he shared a cell with chemical engineer , another German resistance fighter. During his time in Pl√∂tzensee Werner Krauss was able to write, clandestinely, a satirical Roman √† clef entitled \\"Die Passionen der halkyonischen Seele\\" (\\"The Passions of a Halcyon Soul\\") with an air-force officer (Harro Schulze-Boysen) as its principal protagonist. The book was published after the war, in 1946, characterised as an anti-fascist novel: it was reissued in 1983. Before the war ended, formally in May 1945, and having outlasted his death sentence, Krauss had another close brush with death. On 21 April 1945 he was among the inmates from the military prison at Torgau sent on a forced march to the east. It is possible that the authorities wanted to send them to a concentration camp so that they could be put to work. In any event, the column of prisoners was intercepted by advancing US troops. With the help of a doctor Krauss managed to have himself loaded onto a hospital train to Karlsbad, and from there he was taken to a US prisoner of war camp at Eger on the border with Czechoslovakia. He was released on 16 June 1945. =After the war= On his release Krauss made his way back to Marburg, where in 1945 or 1946 he finally received the professorship which the university had felt unable to confer on him during the Nazi years. In 1945 he was one of four co- founders of the influential but short-lived monthly publication, Die Wandlung. He also sat on the committee responsible for denazification of his fellow professors at Marburg. The next year, in 1947, he accepted an invitation to take a professorship in Romance Philology at the Philology-History department of the Philosophy faculty at Leipzig University, where according to one source he expected \\"a more consistent antifascism\\". Post-war Germany to the west of its new frontier with Poland had been divided in 1945 into four military zones of occupation, and the relocation from Marburg to Leipzig involved a move from the US occupation zone to the Soviet occupation zone, a distinction which gained significance during the later 1940s as the Soviet zone became increasingly separated politically from the other three. Shortly after the war Krauss also joined the Communist Party. In a letter dated 19 February 1946 he was appointed the party's representative on the newly launched Consultative Regional Committee (Greater Hessen), intended by the occupiers as a precursor to the Landtag of Hesse (regional legislative assembly) which would accompany the re-establishment of a democratic political structure. However, on 15 May 1946 he resigned his seat on the committee in favour of Jo Mihaly. The territory administered as the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), a one- party state governed by the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) which had been created for the purpose in April 1946. Krauss switched his own party membership to the SED in 1947. In February 1948 Werner Krauss was one of four people identified as \\"intellectuals\\" and inducted into the new party's steering committee, precursor to its powerful Central Committee, of which he remained a member till 1951. The focus of his career nevertheless remained firmly in the academic world. He became a member of the Saxony Academy of Sciences (\\"S√§chsische Akademie der Wissenschaften\\") in 1949, and in 1951 took a professorship with a teaching chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin. His work concentrated increasingly on the French Enlightenment. In 1955, under the auspices of the German Academy of Sciences, he set up a working group on the history of the French and German Enlightenment, and research on these themes would be at the centre of his working life even after he moved permanently to Berlin in 1961, till his retirement in 1965. As well as publishing his own works he promoted the translation of important foreign language contributions on the subject, always keen to use the experiences of eighteenth century intellectual awakening to illuminate the present.

Conway grew up in the Manchester area, and left school at the age of fourteen to work at the Metropolitan-Vickers factory at Trafford Park. There, he joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) and became a shop steward. He also joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), but soon left to join the Labour Party, and subsequently became associated with the right-wing of the labour movement. In 1949, he was elected to the AEU's Manchester Area Committee, and in 1952 as a Labour Party member of Manchester City Council, serving for eight years.\\"Jim Conway\\", The Guardian, 5 March 1974, p.6 In 1959, Conway became national organiser of the AEU, then assistant general secretary in 1962, and in 1964 was elected as the union's general secretary.\\"CONWAY James\\", Who Was Who Under his leadership, the union merged with the Amalgamated Union of Foundry Workers, becoming the Amalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry Workers, then with the Draughtsmen and Allied Technicians' Association and the Constructional Engineering Union, being renamed the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. In 1974, Conway was returning from Paris on Turkish Airlines Flight 981, when it crashed, resulting in the deaths of all on board. Following Jim Conway's death, an educational and research trust, The Jim Conway Foundation (JCF), was established as a tribute to his work in the trade union movement. Andy Wood, Conway's Personal Assistant from 1966, founded the organisation. The JCF began by organising weekend seminars for rank and file trade unionists. Following a grant from the Manpower Services Commission's Job Creation Programme, the JCF was able to engage its first full-time staff; it established a research department and began to carry out independent research on employment related issues. In the late 1970s, the JCF formed links with the Friedrich Ebert Stifftung, a large German organisation associated with the German Social Democratic Party, with which it worked closely on trade union and work related social issues for the rest of the twentieth century. In the 1990s, the JCF became involved with training programmes in Eastern Europe. The European Commission's Poland and Hungary Aid funded this involvement for the Regeneration of the Economies (PHARE) and Technical Assistance to CIS Countries (TACIS). The Foreign & Commonwealth Office also helped fund the European programme through its Know How Fund. Andy Wood retired in 1998 and the JCF ceased to exist two years later.

He was best known as a pioneer in using distance learning for teaching mathematics.  Biography  Gross was born in Boston MA in 1929. He studied mathematics at Brandeis University and graduated in 1953 with a B.A. in mathematics. He then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a Ph. D. candidate and a Teaching Assistant in mathematics. In 1958, prior to having completed his studies at MIT, he left to become the founding mathematics department chairperson at Corning (NY) Community College where he remained for the next ten years. During that time he became Corning‚Äôs first educational television instructor, teaching calculus to high school students in Corning‚Äôs three high schools and published his first textbook (Mathematics: A Chronicle of Human Endeavor). He left Corning in 1968 to become the Senior Lecturer at MIT's Center for Advanced Engineering Study (CAES) where, from 1968 to 1973, he produced the critically acclaimed video course ‚ÄúCalculus Revisited‚Äù. In 1985 he produced Classic Arithmetic Coursehttp://www.adjectivenounmath.com/id75.html which was videotaped and since attracted many views and is considered to be a classic. In 2011 MIT's OpenCourseWare made the course available on its website where it has become a ‚Äúcult classic‚Äù because of its ‚Äúarchaic‚Äù black-and-white- talking-head format. It has received over a million views on YouTube. In 1973 he left MIT to become the founding Mathematics Department Chairperson at Bunker Hill (Boston MA) Community College, where he remained until his retirement in 2003. While there he developed video courses in arithmetic and algebra and his work in those areas is available, free of charge for anyone to use, at http://www.mathasasecondlanguage.org. He also has another Website http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/ which contain his Classic Arithmetic Course, Algebra Course And Calculus Revisited Series.http://www.adjectivenounmath.com/index.html After his retirement in 2003, he continued to develop his websites while working with elementary school teachers in an attempt to help them help their students internalize mathematics better. 1974 Gross was the founding president of the American Mathematics Association of Two Year Colleges (AMATYC). In 2014, at age 85 and under the sponsorship of Corning Inc., Gross developed a series of 40 arithmetic videos, designed to help elementary school teachers.  Social engagement  Gross chose to leave MIT to be able to move into the community college/prison environment. Gross: \\"In terms of a way of life there was something special to me about using my method of teaching math to help mathematically at-risk adults learn to overcome their fear of math and thus increases their chances for greater upward mobility.\\" Gross often refers to the community colleges as ‚Äúthe statue of liberty for those who otherwise might have been educationally disenfranchised‚Äù.E-mail communication November 30, 2014. Gross was lauded by the principal of the Vocational School at the Harnett Correctional Institution for his work with the prisoners and his successful ‚ÄúGateways to Mathematics‚Äù course (which was subtitled ‚ÄúConfidence through Competence‚Äù), turning even hard-core inmates around.Principal Jim Brown of the Vocational School in Harnett Correctional Institution News Release 1990: \\"Professor Gross is one of those educators who practices the things he preaches. For example, when he talks about building self-esteem, he is serious and he puts it into use in his program as well as in the classroom.\\"  Awards and honors  In 2014, Gross' work was recognized by the State University of New York (SUNY), who bestowed upon him the award of Doctor of Humane Letters.

Born into a Methodist family, she received a scholarship to study in Brazil, from where she corresponded with Martin Luther King Jr. Fearing extradition, she continued her education in the United States before returning to Angola. Rodr√≠guez was a member of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and co- founded its women's wing, the Organiza√ß√£o da Mulher de Angola (Organization of Angolan Women; OMA). She captured, tortured, and executed by a rival nationalist group in 1967. A documentary of her life was released in 2014. Biography Rodr√≠guez de Almeida was born in Catete, Angola, on 10 February 1939. Her Methodist parents were schoolteachers, and she was a middle child, with four other siblings. She moved to Luanda and lived with her cousin, the poet Agostinho Neto, who went on to become the first president of Angola. Though she was educated in the Methodist Missionary schools and taught writing and translating while a young girl, by the late 1950s she had begun to question the paternal attitude of both the government and the church. In 1956, Rodr√≠guez joined the MPLA as a translator. While a sociology student on scholarship at Methodist University of S√£o Paulo in 1959, she exchanged correspondence with Martin Luther King Jr. Fearing she would be extradited from Brazil because of the Portuguese Imperial relationship between its colonies and her support of the growing Angolan Independence movement, Rodr√≠guez de Almeida moved to the United States the following year and studied at Drew University. Because she wanted to be an active participant in Angola's independence, Rodr√≠guez did not finish school and decided to leave the U.S. In February 1961, she was recruited to participate in the MPLA attack on \\"Fortalesa\\", later gaining the honorary title of \\"Mother of the Revolution\\". Rodr√≠guez traveled to Guinea-Bissau and Congo Kinshasa, where she co-founded the Organiza√ß√£o da Mulher de Angola (Organization of Angolan Women; OMA), the women's division of the MPLA. She received guerrilla training in Kabinda, and joined the Esquadr√£o Kamy. She returned to Angola in 1962. As a revolutionary movement leader and activist, she campaigned for human rights in Angola, and was associated with the Corpo Volunt√°rio Angolano de Assist√™ncia aos Refugiados (CVAAR). In 1963, the government expelled the MPLA leadership, forcing them to flee to Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo. Her writings from the time show an increasing move towards Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and a painful awareness that her womanhood made her invisible even though she was part of the leadership. She expressed her frustration at the discrimination she faced for her lack of domesticity, saying that she was treated as if being single was \\"shameful or of the devil\\". Pushed out of Brazzaville, the MPLA moved to the border with Cabinda in 1966, where fighting intensified over the next two years. Rodr√≠guez de Almeida and four other OMA members (Engracia dos Santos, Irene Cohen, Lucrecia Paim, and Teresa Afonso) were captured by the Uni√£o dos Povos de Angola (UPA) guerrilla group (later, National Liberation Front of Angola) on 2 March 1967. They were tortured and dismembered alive. Taken to the FNLA camp, Kinkuzu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rodr√≠guez was executed in prison. Posthumously, her diary was published in 2003 under the title Di√°rio de um exilio sem regresso and her letters and correspondence were published in 2004 as Cartas de Langidila e outros documentos. In 2010, a documentary of her life was begun. Filmed in Angola, Brazil and Mozambique, the film interviews associates and incorporates text from Rodr√≠gues's diaries. It took four years for the documentary to reach completion. Langidila‚Äîdi√°rio de um ex√≠lio sem regresso (Langidila‚ÄîDiary of an exile without return) was released in 2014 and gives the story of the independence of Angola from the perspective of Rodr√≠guez and her companions.

He was one of the last prominent members of the Banu Sulaym tribe to convert to Islam, and fought against Muhammad at the Battle of Hunayn in 629. After becoming a Muslim, he took part in the conquest of Syria in the 630s and fought at Yarmouk. Later, he commanded the Arab navy during the campaigns against the Byzantines in the eastern Mediterranean, including the decisive Muslim victory at the Battle of the Masts in 655. His army was also responsible for the destruction of the colossus of Rhodes. From the First Muslim Civil War until his disappearance from the historical record in the 660s, Abu al-A'war served Mu'awiya in a number of capacities, including as a commander and negotiator at the Battle of Siffin, an operative of Amr ibn al-As in Egypt, a tax administrator in Palestine and the governor of Jordan; he had held the latter post since the reign of Uthman. Early life and career Abu al-A'war's given name was Amr and he was born to Sufyan ibn Abd Shams; the latter was a chieftain of the prominent Dhakwan clan of the Banu Sulaym, a nomadic Arab tribe that dominated the Harra region in the north-central Hejaz (in present-day western Saudi Arabia) and had strong links to Medina and Mecca.Lecker 1997, pp. 817‚Äì818.Al- Tabari, ed. Blankinship 1993, p. 91, n. 502. Abu al-A'war's mother and grandmother both belonged to the Quraysh tribe of Mecca.Lecker 1997, p. 818. His father Sufyan commanded the Sulaym when they fought alongside the Quraysh against Muhammad and the early Muslims at the Battle of the Trench in 627 CE.Lecker 1997, p. 817. Although most of the Sulaym converted to Islam by 629, Abu al-A'war, who was a confederate of the pagan Qurayshi leader Abu Sufyan, proved an exception and fought against the Muslims at the Battle of Hunayn that year. Abu al-A'war ultimately converted to Islam, though his status as a ·π£a·∏•ƒÅba (companion of Muhammad) is disputed by Muslim scholars. Indeed, the highly authoritative Muslim scholar Muhammad al-Bukhari does not mention Abu al-A'war in his list of ·π£a·∏•ƒÅba. Campaigns against the Byzantines Abu al-A'war was likely part of the army of Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan dispatched by Caliph Abu Bakr () to conquer Byzantine Syria.Lammens 1960, p. 108. He commanded a detachment of Yazid's forces at the Battle of Yarmouk, during which the Byzantines were routed and much of Syria was annexed by the growing Rashidun Caliphate. His relationship with Yazid and his father Abu Sufyan helped establish his enduring loyalty to their Umayyad clan throughout his career. Under the direction of Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, Yazid's brother and the governor of Syria, Abu al-A'war and Wahb ibn Umayr, led a raid against the Byzantine city of Amorion in 644; this marked the start of both strategic and marauding Muslim military campaigns into Byzantine Anatolia.Kaegi 1992, p. 246. He commanded the second Arab raid against Cyprus, which probably took place in summer 650. The Arabs besieged the town of Lapithos, but abandoned the siege after the inhabitants paid a large sum of money. It appears that the Arabs did not evacuate the island entirely, however, and that Abu al-A'war erected a fortress with a garrison of 12,000 men, who according to the Arabic sources remained on the island until the peace treaty of 680, following the failure of the First Arab Siege of Constantinople. Abu al-A'war seems to have commanded this garrison for some time, since the 10th-century Byzantine emperor Constantine VII records that the Arab \\"Aboubacharos\\"‚Äîwho is likely to be identified with Abu al-A'war‚Äîerected a tomb for his daughter, who died there, which survived to Constantine's day. According to Michael the Syrian, shortly after this, in 653/654, Abu al-A'war commanded an expedition against Kos, which was captured and plundered due to the treason of the local bishop. He proceeded to pillage Crete and Rhodes. The latter was a major commercial island and its capture was a major loss to the Byzantines. During the pillaging of Rhodes, Abu al-A'war's troops leveled the Colossus of Rhodes, a well-known statue of the Greek god Helios. Finally in 654 he commanded the Arab fleet in the great Battle of the Masts, where the Byzantine navy under Emperor Constans II was annihilated. According to Armenian and Byzantine sources, his fleet continued onward to besiege Constantinople but a storm destroyed the ships carrying siege engines. This loss is absent from Arabic chronicles. Service with Mu'awiya Caliph Uthman (), who belonged to the Umayyad clan, appointed Abu al-A'war as governor of Jund al-Urdunn (military district of Jordan) with its capital in Tiberias.Gil 1997, p. 116. During the First Muslim Civil War, which followed the assassination of Uthman, Abu al-A'war served as one of Mu'awiya's generals in the battles against Caliph Ali (). He commanded a Sulaymi contingent at the Battle of Siffin in 657. Following the fighting at Siffin, Abu al-A'war was one Mu'awiya's representatives in the settlement negotiations with Ali, and he prepared the preliminary draft for the caliphal succession conference in Adhruh, a town in the Sharat highlands. In 658/59, Mu'awiya confirmed Abu al-A'war in his post in Jordan.Gil 1997, p. 117. Later, Abu al-A'war assisted Amr ibn al-As with asserting Mu'awiya's authority over Egypt. After Mu'awiya succeeded Ali in 661 and established the Umayyad Caliphate, he intended to replace Amr, his independent-minded governor in Egypt, with Abu al-A'war, but this plan never came to fruition. Instead, Abu al-A'war was kept as governor of Jordan. According to Michael the Syrian, in 669,Gil 1997, p. 76. Abu al-A'war oversaw the census of the fellƒÅ·∏•ƒ´n (peasantry) of Jund Filastin (military district of Palestine), and thereby introduced the system of taxation imposed on the Christian villages of Palestine. Legacy On account of his services for Mu'awiya, medieval Muslim historians regarded Abu al-A'war as one of Mu'awiya's senior lieutenants and part of the latter's bi·π≠ƒÅna (inner circle). Abu al-A'war disappears from the historical record before the end of Mu'awiya's reign in 680. During his lifetime, his son Sufyan was a military chief of the Arab tribes in Jordan. His nephew or great-grandson, Ubayda ibn Abd al-Rahman, served as the provincial governor of Azerbaijan, Jordan, and Ifriqiya during the reigns of Umayyad caliphs Umar II () Hisham () and al- Walid II (), respectively.

It represents a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD manifested by either one or a combination of the following: * Abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus (phosphate), parathyroid hormone, or vitamin D metabolism * Abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength * Vascular or other soft-tissue calcification CKD-MBD explains, at least in part, the high morbidity and mortality of CKD patients, linking kidney and bone disease with cardiovascular complications. It is a matter of discussion whether CKD- MBD may be considered a real syndrome or not. CKD-MBD broadens the \\"old\\" concept of \\"renal osteodystrophy\\", which now should be restricted to describing the bone pathology associated with CKD. Thus, renal osteodystrophy is currently considered one measure of the skeletal component of the systemic disorder of CKD‚ÄìMBD that is quantifiable by histomorphometry of bone biopsy. New guidelines have been recently released. Pathophysiology It is well- known that as kidney function declines, there is a progressive deterioration in mineral homeostasis, with a disruption of normal serum and tissue concentrations of phosphorus and calcium, and changes in circulating levels of hormones. These include parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) vitamin D; calcidiol), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2 vitamin D; calcitriol), and other vitamin D metabolites, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and growth hormone. Beginning in CKD stage 3, the ability of the kidneys to appropriately excrete a phosphate load is diminished, leading to hyperphosphatemia, elevated PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism), and decreased 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D with associated elevations in the levels of FGF-23. The conversion of 25(OH) vitamin D to 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D is impaired, reducing intestinal calcium absorption and increasing PTH. The kidney fails to respond adequately to PTH, which normally promotes phosphaturia and calcium reabsorption, or to FGF-23, which also enhances phosphate excretion. In addition, there is evidence at the tissue level of a downregulation of vitamin D receptor and of resistance to the actions of PTH. Therapy is generally focused on correcting biochemical and hormonal abnormalities in an effort to limit their consequences. The mineral and endocrine functions disrupted in CKD are critically important in the regulation of both initial bone formation during growth (bone modeling) and bone structure and function during adulthood (bone remodeling). As a result, bone abnormalities are found almost universally in patients with CKD requiring dialysis (stage 5D), and in the majority of patients with CKD stages 3‚Äì5. More recently, there has been an increasing concern of extraskeletal calcification that may result from the deranged mineral and bone metabolism of CKD and from the therapies used to correct these abnormalities. Numerous cohort studies have shown associations between disorders of mineral metabolism and fractures, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. These observational studies have broadened the focus of CKD- related mineral and bone disorders (MBDs) to include cardiovascular disease (which is the leading cause of death in patients at all stages of CKD). All three of these processes (abnormal mineral metabolism, abnormal bone, and extraskeletal calcification) are closely interrelated and together make a major contribution to the morbidity and mortality of patients with CKD. The traditional definition of renal osteodystrophy did not accurately encompass this more diverse clinical spectrum, based on serum biomarkers, noninvasive imaging, and bone abnormalities. The absence of a generally accepted definition and diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy prompted Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)] to sponsor a controversies conference, entitled Definition, Evaluation, and Classification of Renal Osteodystrophy, in 2005. The principal conclusion was that the term CKD‚ÄìMineral and Bone Disorder (CKD‚ÄìMBD) should now be used to describe the broader clinical syndrome encompassing mineral, bone, and calcific cardiovascular abnormalities that develop as a complication of CKD. Diagnosis Treatment Treatment efforts may involve many clinical and diagnostic manoeuvers, such as trying to decrease phosphate, normalize vitamin D (calcidiol levels) or decrease PTH and/or alkaline phosphatase levels. However, there is an important lack of randomized clinical studies and recent guidelines (KDIGO 2017) have been recently released on the topic. Although it was previously considered, normalization of calcemia is not included in modern treatment goals since the availability of calcimimetics.

Finley was born in Philadelphia in 1899 to Michael Finley and Katherine Reilly Finley. Michael Finley was active in Democratic politics in the city, and his son followed him in that role. Finley started his working life as a chauffeur before attending La Salle College. After graduation, he became involved in textile manufacturing. Finley took his first political job at a State Revenue Department, and later worked for the Internal Revenue Service as chief of the Social Security division. He became director of the State Liquid Fuels Tax Bureau, where he was in charge of administering gasoline taxes. While working in state government, he became the Democratic leader for Philadelphia's 50th ward (covering his neighborhood of West Oak Lane) at a time when Republicans dominated the city's politics. In 1951, Philadelphia adopted a new city charter; that same year, Democrats swept to victory in mayoral and city council races, breaking the Republicans' 67-year-long control of city government. Finley was among those elected, winning a city council seat from the ninth district with 63% of the vote. The Democratic party was led by a reform faction that attracted the votes of many Republicans disappointed in political corruption under their party's leadership. He served as chairman of the Council's committee on Municipal Development and Zoning. In 1954, Finley backed the reform faction of the party, led by mayor Joseph S. Clark, Jr., when several ward leaders led by Democratic City Chairman William J. Green, Jr., unsuccessfully sought to amend the city charter to remove civil service reforms. Finley was reelected as councilman from the ninth district in 1955 with 61% of the vote. He died of a heart attack in 1958 while vacationing in Margate, New Jersey. He is buried in Whitemarsh Memorial Park in Ambler, Pennsylvania.

The coronation robe of Queen Alexandra of England, which is said to have been of surpassing richness and beauty, was woven and embroidered in a factory upon the Chandni Chauk, and the merchant who made it is constantly receiving orders from the different courts of Europe and from the leading dressmakers of London, Paris and Vienna. He told us that Mrs. Leland Stanford had commissioned him to furnish the museum of her university in California the finest possible samples of different styles of Indian embroidery, and his workmen were then engaged in producing them. Her contract, he said, amounted to more than $60,000. Lady Curzon is his best customer, for she not only orders all of the material for her state gowns from him, but has brought him enough orders from the ladies of the British court to keep his shop busy for five years. He told us that Lady Curzon designed the coronation robe of Queen Alexandra; he declared that she had the rarest taste of any woman he knew, and that she was the best dressed woman in the worldan opinion shared by other good judges. He spread upon the floor wonderful samples of the skill and taste of his artists, brocades embroidered with jewels for the ceremonial robes of native princes; silks and satins whose surface was concealed by patterns wrought in gold and silver thread. And everything is done by men. Women do not embroider in India. He keeps eighty men embroiderers constantly employed, and pays them an average of 18 cents a day. The most famous of his artists, those who design as well as execute the delicate and costly garnishings, the men who made the coronation robe of the British queen, receive the munificent compensation of 42 cents a day. That is the maximum paid for such work. Apprentices who do the filling in and coarser work and have not yet acquired sufficient skill and experience to undertake more important tasks are paid 8 cents a day and work twelve hours for that...... Lord Curzon has used his official authority and the influence of the government to revive, restore and promote old native industries, and Lady Curzon has been an invaluable commercial agent for the manufacturers of the higher class of fabrics and art objects in India. She has made many of them fashionable in Calcutta and other Indian cities and in London, Paris and the capitals of Europe, and so great is her zeal that, with all her cares and responsibilities, and the demands upon her time, she always has the leisure to place orders for her friends and even for strangers who address her, and to assist the silk weavers, embroiderers and other artists to adapt their designs and patterns and fabrics to the requirements of modern fashions. She wears nothing but Indian stuffs herself, and there is no better dressed woman in the world. She keeps several of the best artists in India busy with orders from her friends, and is beginning to see the results of her efforts in the revival of arts that were almost forgotten..... And the durbar demonstrated the wisdom of those who planned it. The expense was quite large. The total disbursements by the government were about $880,000, and it is probable that an equal amount was expended by the princes and other people who participated. That has been the subject of severe criticism also, because the people were only slowly recovering from the effect of an awful famine. But there is another point of view. Every farthing of those funds was spent in India and represented wages paid to workmen employed in making the preparations and carrying them into effect. No money went out of the country. It all came out of the pockets of the rich and was paid into the hands of the poor. What the government and the native princes and nobles expended in their splendid displays was paid to working people who needed it, and by throwing this large amount into circulation the entire country was benefited. The extravagance of the Viceroy and Lady Curzon in their own personal arrangements has also been criticised, and people complain that they might have done great good with the immense sums expended in dress and entertainment and display, but it is easy to construe these criticisms into compliments, for everyone testifies that both the viceroy and his beautiful American wife performed their parts to perfection, and that no one could have appeared with greater dignity and grace.\\" using the zardozi (gold wire weaving) method. It was then shipped to Paris, where the House of Worth styled the dress with a long train edged with white chiffon roses. The worked panels were overlapping peacock feathers that had a blue/green beetlewing at the center. Over time, the metal thread in the dress has tarnished but the beetle wings have not lost their luster.[Note: While Lady Curzon was commissioning her dress embroidery she was also tasked with the embroidery for three dresses for Queen Alexandria, each potentially for her coronation. Her letters describing this process are archived in the British Library in the India Office Records. Citations for which letters mention Queen Alexandria and Lady Curzon's involvement can be found in Inside the Royal Wardrobe: A Dress History of Queen Alexandria by Kate Eicher, Chapter Eight. See also citation on Queen Alexandria's Wikipedia page.] The Viceroy, Lord Curzon, organized the second Delhi Durbar in 1903 to celebrate the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII, \\"the grandest pageant in history\\", which created a tremendous sensation. The dress was featured in a Chicago Tribune article because Lady Curzon was from Chicago. State portraits were ordered from the artist William Logsdail, but Lady Curzon's portrait was completed in 1909 after her death in 1906. The peacock dress is preserved, together with the Logsdail portrait, at Kedleston Hall. Lady Curzon was instrumental in promoting the use of Indian embroidery in Western fashion, and many of her friends ordered gowns from Worth using such decorations, though they generally used much less metal threadwork which weighed her dress down. According to its entry at Kedleston Hall, the peacock gown weighs 10 pounds. Another of her embroidered court dresses, assembled by the House of Worth in 1903, is on display at the Fashion Museum, Bath.

It is centered on Old Mill Road, and developed as a mill village beginning in the 18th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history East Arlington is located in central eastern Arlington, a town on Vermont's western border with New York, and overlaps slightly into neighboring Sunderland. It is north of Vermont Route 313 and west of United States Route 7, the major north‚Äìsouth route through western Vermont. The village was settled in the 1760s, and is one of the earliest colonial settlements in the state. Settlers were drawn by the water power provided by Peter's Branch and Warm Brook, which powered the area's industries into the early 20th century. The village was bypassed by the railroad (which runs to the west, by Arlington's central village), and its water power was relatively modest, leading to a decline in industrial activity. In the early 20th century, the Hale Company expanded operations, despite these limitations; portions of its mill complex still survive. The historic district is organized around the village's major roadways, which are East Arlington Street and Ice Pond Road, running roughly east‚Äìwest, and Warm Brook Road and Old Mill Road, which run generally north‚Äìsouth, with a further extension along Kansas Road into Sunderland to the east. Most of the buildings in the district are Greek Revival in style, an indication of the village's most significant period of growth (in the second quarter of the 19th century), although earlier Federal and later Italianate and Queen Anne styles are also represented. Most of these are vernacular in expression, and a number of buildings have been at least partly compromised by the application of 20th-century siding. There is no central common or open green space, a typical feature of many New England villages, and there is only one church, the 1845-48 Greek Revival Congregational Church.

She helped to set up the women's section of the Rassemblement D√©mocratique Africain in C√¥te d'Ivoire and Upper Volta, becoming its secretary general in 1948. In 1958, she was appointed Upper Volta's Minister of Social Affairs, probably making her the first woman to join a cabinet in any of the French-speaking West African governments. Biography Ouezzin Coulibaly was born in the Banfora region in the south-west of today's Burkina Faso, then known as Upper Volta. Known at birth as Macoucou Traor√© (or Makoukou Traor√©), she was the daughter of Balla Traor√©, who was chief of the Sindou Canton. Her education culminated in a teaching diploma. In 1930, she married Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly, obtaining the name C√©lestine in 1931 when she and her husband were baptized as Roman Catholics. She helped to set up the women's section of the Rassemblement D√©mocratique Africain in C√¥te d'Ivoire and Upper Volta, becoming its secretary general in 1948. Ouezzin Coulibaly was one of those who led some 1,500 women in a march to the prison at Grand-Bassam on 24 December 1949 calling for the release of their husbands who, as members of the PDCI-RDA independence movement, had been jailed without trial by the French colonial authorities. Together with fellow leaders Anne-Marie Rachi, Margu√©rite Sacoum, Odette Yac√© and Marie Kor√©, she can therefore be considered one of the pioneers of the independence of the Ivory Coast. On 24 October 1958, Ouezzin Coulibaly was appointed Upper Volta's Minister of Social Affairs, Housing and Employment. Her appointment, probably the first for a women in French West Africa, seemed to be a promising development. It was not, however, quite as revolutionary as it might have seemed as it occurred only six weeks after the death of her husband, who had been President of the Council in Upper Volta. Although his death probably played an important part in her appointment, as a trained schoolteacher and one of the country's few literate women, she was in fact fully qualified for the position. After she left the position in 1959, despite becoming the first female member of the national assembly, the fact that she did not obtain a government post after Upper Volta's independence in 1960 could be considered a backward step for the political role of women. Representing Upper Volta, Ouezzin Coulibaly was elected to the senate of the French Community on 30 April 1959 where she sat on the Committee for Transport and Telecommunications. She held the position until 16 March 1961.

He was elected mayor of Algiers in 1898 but was soon dismissed from office. He campaigned unsuccessfully for election as a national deputy in 1901 as an antisemitic candidate. He lived the rest of his life in obscurity. Social context During the later part of the 19th century the civil territories of Algeria, dominated by settlers, were officially part of France and had many of the same laws and political features as metropolitan France. Jews had lived in Algeria for centuries, including some who came from Spain in the late 15th century. The 35,000 Jews spoke Arabic but were oppressed by the 2.5 million Arab Muslims. The Jews welcomed the French as liberators, and by the 1870 Cr√©mieux Decree were made full French citizens, while the Arabs had no civil rights. Antisemitism became a feature of politics after 1870. There were violent anti- Jewish incidents between 1881 and 1884, and in 1889. During the 1890s Algeria was affected by an economic depression. Further incidents began during 1894 in response to the Dreyfus affair. This scandal rousing antisemitic passions in metropolitan France and among the Pied-Noir French colonists in Algeria. Life =Early years= Massimiliano R√©gis Milano was born on 8 June 1873 at S√©tif in French Algeria. His family was Italian in origin. Max R√©gis, as he became known, was brought up in a comfortable middle-class home near to Algiers. At the age of 10 he went to study at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand, then returned to the High School of Algiers, and finally passed his baccalaureate in Montpellier. He spent a year studying at the Law Faculty of Algiers, then became chief editor of his home town newspaper Le Progr√®s de S√©tif. At the age of 21 Max R√©gis fought a duel with an officer named Perroux, and relocated to Tunis for two months to avoid arrest. He was ordered to military service with the 12th artillery regiment in Oran. After his discharge he returned to Algiers to continue his legal studies. =Antisemitic activist= Max R√©gis in prison in Algiers. At the start of 1897 Max R√©gis and his brother Louis organized student protests against the appointment of a Jewish professor of Law named L√©vy. Max R√©gis gained the nickname \\"beau Max\\". He was \\"tall, handsome, strong and energetic\\", and charismatic. As a result of his activism he was suspended from university for two years. Soon after he was named president of the Ligue Antijuive (Anti-Jewish League), and on 14 July 1897 initiated the antisemitic newspaper L'Antijuif d'Alger. L'Anti-Juif had a print run of 20,000 copies, a large number for Algeria at this time. The Algiers Anti-Jewish League became important among the settlers. It organized petitions and demonstrations against Jews and government officials. Max R√©gis directed the Fighting Radicals, an anti-capitalist and socialist political group. The funeral of the founder of the Algiers Ligue Antis√©metique was held in September 1897. The prefect of Algiers made mass arrests at the event, a mistake that Regis exploited to increase emotions. Protest meetings and student marches began on 18 January 1898. The Jews fought back, and there were injuries on both sides. When a Christian rioter was killed his funeral became a large antisemitic rally. One Jew was beaten to death. There were more than 100 injuries and more than 600 demonstrators were arrested. Regis had his devotees rampage in nine towns in which two Jews and one other were killed, 158 shops were burned and several synagogues were desecrated. The government was slow to suppress the violence. After six days of mob violence in Algiers the Jewish quarter was wrecked. On 20 February 1898 at an antisemitic meeting in the Salle Chaynes in Paris R√©gis said, \\"We will water the tree of liberty with the blood of Jews. This threat was printed in Le R√©veil alg√©rien that year. At the start of March 1898 Max Regis was among the speakers criticizing Jews and their \\"Dreyfusard servants\\" at a meeting of 800 people in the Salle Wagram in Paris. Other speakers were Charles Devos, √âdouard Duboc and Jules Gu√©rin. On 16 March 1898 R√©gis fought a duel in Algiers with Captain Oger, who had been insulted during the Anti-juif. On 17 March 1898 the Court of Appeal in Algiers confirmed a judgement that sentenced R√©gis to four months in prison. He was arrested on 21 March 1898. For the national elections of May 1898, R√©gis endorsed √âdouard Drumont, author of the antisemitic pamphlet La France juive (Jewish France), theoretician of antisemitism in France, in the elections to the national legislature in Algiers. On 8 May 1898 √âdouard Drumont was elected with 11,557 votes against 2,328 and 1,741 for his opponents. Of six Algerian national deputies, four were elected as part of Regis's Anti-Jewish League. At almost the same date, Max R√©gis was elected mayor of Algiers at the age of 25, but his election was annulled. =Mayor of Algiers = Max R√©gis in 1898 All 36 municipal councillors elected in Algiers in November 1898 were antisemitic. Max R√©gis, their leader, said of the Jews, \\"now they will all have to starve.\\" On 20 November 1898 the Antijuif said, \\"The Jews must leave and they must leave voluntarily today, for if they do not they will by forced to leave tomorrow.\\" As mayor of Algiers, the first measures of R√©gis were: *Cafes that receive Jews cannot have a terrace *No loitering for hawkers *Jewish coachmen must park at specified locations *The Municipal Theater is closed to Jews Looting of Jewish shops became frequent. The Algerian antisemitism was so powerful that Regis spoke of autonomy: \\"If the French refuse to liberate themselves from the Jews, the Algerian people will take its destiny into its own hands!\\" A month later, on 12 December 1898, Max Regis was suspended for three months as mayor of Algiers. M. Lutaud was appointed prefect of the city. On 26 December 1898 R√©gis opposed M. Le Pic in a duel. The two men were slightly injured. On 9 January 1899 Max R√©gis was removed from office as mayor of Algiers after making insults against the authorities. The Governor General √âdouard Laferri√®re arranged for his removal. =Later career= On 22 February 1899 Max R√©gis was sentenced by the Criminal Court to three years in prison and a fine. The French government began to suppress antisemitic activities while accepting some of the demands of the more moderate autonomist settlers. Regis's youth groups were banned and their meeting places were closed. He spent his time either hiding in his \\"Villa Antijuive\\" or in Spain. The number of his endorsers decreased to a rump of autonomists from lower-class Spanish areas. In January 1901 Max R√©gis campaigned in a Paris by-election against the Socialist Jean Allemane. He was endorsed by Drumont but had little or no backing from the Ligue des Patriotes and Ligue de la patrie fran√ßaise, and failed to be elected. In 1901 R√©gis was involved in a tavern brawl with a rival. The incident further discredited him and marked the end of the Jewish crisis in Algeria. Anti-Semitic politics in France began to dissolve into minor groups as the 1902 national elections approached. Little is known of the remainder of Max R√©gis's life. Apparently he became a hotel keeper. In 1910 he married in Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes. He died in obscurity in the Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es in 1950.

History The South Australian Mining Association (SAMA) was formed in 1841 following a letter to the South Australian newspapers by Johann Menge, extolling the mineral wealth which he believed lay under the soil, and later itemised. and discovery of silver-lead ore to the east of Adelaide, dubbed the Wheal Gawler mine. Shares were offered to the public. John Bentham Neales was agent and George Morphett the barrister for the Association, whose shares were under-subscribed, and whatever mining may have taken place was not newsworthy. On 16 April 1845 the Association was resurrected, or a new one formed with the same name (it is not easy to determine which), as a no liability (or no- responsibility in the terminology of the day) company. At the land sales of 19 April 1845 the Association made a purchase adjoining Captain Bagot's property near Kapunda, and another on the River Torrens near Montacute. Henry Mildred was appointed chairman; seven members of the Association were elected to form the board of management (three to be replaced each year). They were (in order of votes received) Emanuel Solomon, John Cundy Sleman (who left Australia in December 1846), Charles Beck, Samuel Stocks, jun., William Peacock, Jacob Hagen, George Bean. Other candidates were: (again in order of votes received) William Paxton, Matthew Smith, Thomas Whistler, Samuel Payne, Tom Cox Bray, Robert Sanders and Edward Castres Gwynne. The firm of Smart & Payne was appointed their solicitors and Henry Ayers secretary. Other subscribers were: J. Dickens, Michael Featherstone, J. B. Graham, G. S. Kingston, J. B. Neales, John Newman, Robert Pepperell, John Ridley, George Stevenson, ?? White. Other names were William Allen, Frederick John Beck, Joseph Bouch, James Bunce, (Edward?) Drew, Anthony Hall, John Hallett, James Hardman, James Masters, Christopher Septimus Penny, Henry Roach, John Slatter, Thomas Waterhouse. Following a newspaper advertisement soliciting mineral samples, on 9 June 1845 William Strear brought samples of a rich copper ore into the office of Henry Ayers, the Association's secretary. Strear, a young shepherd employed by pastoralist James Stein, had walked the from Burra; a similar find was reported by Thomas Pickett, a bullock driver employed by William Robinson of Gum Creek, near Manoora.Pickett did not enjoy the fruits of his discovery for long. Around 18 November 1851, dead drunk, he fell into the fire in his hut and suffered fatal injuries. News of the discovery was published on 21 June in Adelaide newspapers, and the site was soon named The Monster Mine. A Special Survey of of August 1845 on the Burra Creek was drawn up, and which was expected to encompass any potential mine sites. Two parties tendered for the mineral rights: the Association and the Princess Royal Company (dubbed the \\"Nobs\\", these were much wealthier individuals), whose members were George F. Aston, George Frederick Aston (c. 1792 ‚Äì 12 January 1875) returned to England around 1855, died at his home in St James's. George Morphett left in October 1860. John Grainger; Charles Hervey Bagot, Francis S. Dutton and other proprietors of the Kapunda mine; two (unnamed) English investors; Thomas Shepherd, Joseph Johnson, and George Tinline. George Morphett acted as Chairman, E. A. Wright as Secretary. An amicable arrangement was made between these two groups: that each should pay half the ¬£20,000 in specie demanded by Governor Grey, that the surveyed area should be divided in two, which was done on 20 September 1845, and by some means it was resolved that the Association should have the northern moiety and the Princess Royal Company the southern. The Association wasted little time; they despatched ten Cornish miners, a blacksmith and a captain to the site and began blasting on 29 September, and soon bullock drays loaded with the red copper oxide ore were inching their way to Port Adelaide. Within seven months the Association had made a profit of ¬£20,000; and ¬£90,000 in the first eighteen months. Some shareholders sold up and returned to England with their new-found wealth; Emanuel Solomon realised ¬£200 for every ¬£5 share and went on to other projects, others held on and reaped enormous dividends every year until 1860. In the twelve months to 31 March 1848, 13,533 tons of ore was shipped. By 1 September 1848 every ¬£5 share had earned ¬£50 for its owner, and ¬£315 in the 21 years before the Association was dissolved. Meanwhile, the economy of South Australia, which had been in the doldrums since George Grey became Governor of South Australia in 1841, recovered completely. By March 1848 the number of men and boys working at the mine had risen to 567 and 13,533 tons of ore had been carted to the Port in the previous year by some eight hundred teamsters and between six and seven thousand bullocks. By 1851 there were 1013 working at the mine, and that year shipped 23,338 tons of ore, which would have yielded around 5,000 tons of copper metal, worth something over ¬£450,000. In September 1848 the miners, who were paid on the tribute system,Under the tribute system, miners were paid at a contracted rate dependent on the value of the ore extracted, as opposed to working for wages. The term originally referred to independent miners (\\"tributers\\") who paid a proportion of the value of mineral extracted to the owners of the mine. went on strike over the way assay of their ore was handled. After a week, management met the strikers; Police were on hand but the meeting was orderly and the dispute was settled amicably. A few weeks later, management announced that wages of labourers and carters were to be reduced to 21s. per week, well below what had attracted them to Burra. This especially drew the ire of family men, who were already struggling with the hardships and high living expenses of Burra. The Association won out: the workers accepted the new contract and went back to work in early November. Burra Burra shares rallied to ¬£129. Around mid-1851 news of the gold finds in Victoria reached Burra, and in the year to 31 March 1852, two thirds of the workforce left to try their luck, but the Association still raised some 11,000 tons of ore, for a profit of ¬£58,000. Most of the gold seekers returned disillusioned and eager to return to paid work. In this year the Monster Engine and its massive cast-iron pipework was installed, so that mining could continue below the water table. Keeping water out of the mines at depth remained a major engineering and financial problem. A new prospect named the Karkulto Mine, south of Burra, near Emu Plains, was opened up in 1850. The SAMA and the Royal Mining Company each purchased a large block of land and commenced mining. The Royal Mining Company found some copper but more iron and soon exhausted its funds and the directors' patience. The SAMA abandoned the mine in 1869 without it ever showing a profit. By 1867 the price of copper had dropped to ¬£70 per ton; so low that digging the ore out was no longer profitable. An English expert, John Darlington, came out in 1868 and recommended that what had been a series of underground mines should be opened out to become an open-cut mine in order to recover at low cost the lower grade ore. This was commenced in 1870 and continued until the mine was closed in 1887, but the open cut yielded little or no ore. From 1867 to 1872 no ore was taken out, then captain Robert Sanders took over, and forked the water to the 70 fathom () level, whence it was pumped out, and mining continued for another five years, then on 14 September 1877 mining ceased and 250 men were unemployed. Captain Sanders secured a position with the Walhalla mine in Gippsland. The Association continued to exist as an absentee landlord of many properties in Burra, and by its tough negotiating attitude acted as a brake on development of the town. Much of this property was offered at auction off by Bagot, Shakes & Lewis in 1904, but the reserve prices were so high that only a small fraction was sold and critical blocks adjoining the Burra Creek were held back. Another auction was held in 1912  References  Category:1841 establishments in Australia Category:Mining in South Australia Category:History of mining in Australia Category:Defunct mining companies of Australia Category:Economic history of South Australia ","title":"South Australian Mining Association"},{"id":"49333864","text":"Robert J.

He is a former Sociology Department Chair. He served as the elected Faculty Chair of Clark University from 2000-2006. Early life Ross was born and raised in the Bronx, NY and attended the renowned Bronx High School of Science. He grew up in a Jewish household imbued with social justice values and leftist politics. His stepfather, a cutter in the garment industry with a family history of union activism, and his mother, a teacher and social democrat, withdrew from politics out of fear of reprisals during the McCarthy era. Ross received a B.A. from the University of Michigan (1963) and an M.A. (1966) and a Ph.D. (1975) from the University of Chicago. During a fellowship year in London, after completing his undergraduate degree, he studied with the distinguished British sociologist and academic Marxist Ralph Miliband. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Ross became engaged with political activism on behalf of progressive causes and emerged as a student leader. Inspired by the sit-in movement against racial segregation that began in February 1960. Ross became part of the early leadership of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Ross attended the first SDS convention in June 1960 and became a founder of the Ann Arbor chapter. He helped enlist Tom Hayden who became SDS President. At an SDS meeting held at Ann Arbor in 1961, a National Executive Committee (NEC) was elected with Ross as Vice President. As a delegate at the 1962 annual convention, and a member of the \\"drafting committee\\", Ross participated in writing the Port Huron Statement, which was adopted as the SDS political manifesto. His reading of C. Wright Mills' The Power Elite shaped Ross' intellectual contributions to the document. His senior honors thesis examined the theoretical basis for Mill's work.

The episode was written, storyboarded, and directed by Kirsten Lepore, and filmed entirely via stop motion. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on January 14, 2016. The episode guest stars Kevin Michael Richardson as both a sentient storm and an automated weather alert system. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers that allow him to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, a deadly storm hits the grasslands, forcing Finn, Jake, BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), and Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Pendleton Ward) to build a bunker. In the end, Jake begins beat boxing using nature sounds he has collected, which calms the storm. \\"Bad Jubies\\" is the fourth guest-animated episode of Adventure Time, after season five's \\"A Glitch Is a Glitch\\", and season six's \\"Food Chain\\" and \\"Water Parks Prank\\". Lepore was approached about helming the project after Adventure Time showrunner Adam Muto saw her CalArts MFA thesis film, entitled \\"Move Mountain\\". The episode took roughly one year to make and was animated by Bix Pix Entertainment. \\"Bad Jubies\\" was met with positive critical reception, and upon its debut was viewed by 1.22 million people. Jason Kolowski, the episode's production designer, later won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation at the 68th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in 2016. In early 2017, the episode itself won an Annie Award for Best Animated TV/Broadcast Production for Children's Audience. Plot After an automated weather alert system (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) announces the approach of a dangerous storm, Finn, Jake, Lumpy Space Princess, and BMO build an ad hoc storm shelter. Finn, Lumpy Space Princess, and BMO all chip in to help construct the refuge, but Jake spends most of the time wistfully contemplating nature. When the storm hits and the quartet is cut-off from the outside world, the isolation begins to drive everyone mad. It is then that Jake reveals what he had been doing out in nature earlier: collecting sounds. He begins beat boxing, using the sounds he collected as samples. Soon, the sentient storm (voiced by Richardson) breaks into the shelter, but Jake's nature beat box manages to tame the tempest. Production \\"Bad Jubies\\" is the fourth guest-animated episode of the series, after season five's \\"A Glitch Is a Glitch\\", and season six's \\"Food Chain\\" and \\"Water Park Prank\\". At the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, head writer Kent Osborne first revealed that the show was wanting to utilize stop motion in its next guest-directed episode. On October 24, 2014, Kirsten Lepore, an alumna of both the Maryland Institute College of Art's and CalArts's experimental animation programs, announced via her Twitter that she would be working on a \\"new project\\"; in tandem with this cryptic message, she posted a picture of an Adventure Time storyboard title sheet that listed her as the supervising director and storyboard artist for an episode. Lepore first became involved with the show after her CalArts MFA thesis, the short film entitled \\"Move Mountain\\", was viewed by Adventure Time showrunner and executive producer Adam Muto in early 2014. He emailed Lepore, asking if she would be interested in working on the show. Muto was drawn to Lepore's work because her style‚Äîespecially that which was exhibited in \\"Move Mountain\\"‚Äîwas reminiscent of the spirit of Adventure Time; in an email correspondence with Lepore, Muto reportedly told her that the producers had \\"been wanting to do a stop motion episode for a very long time, [but they] were waiting for the right time and the right fit\\". In an interview The A.V. Club, she noted: \\"I knew this was a huge opportunity and such a huge honor [‚Ä¶] It was really, really exciting for me to be able to get the project.\\" With this being said, prior to the email, Lepore had never seen an episode of Adventure Time, and she soon started to watch the show to get a feel for its aesthetic. Eventually, however, she came to genuinely enjoy the show, and she now claims it is one of her favorites. The episode took roughly one year to make. Approximately five or six months were devoted exclusively to writing, storyboarding, and pitching the episode's plot to the show's writers and the network. Lepore was initially worried because she had limited experience with writing lines for characters, as her previous films had almost exclusively lacked dialogue. Lepore claimed to have relegated herself to her bedroom for five weeks while she wrote and storyboarded the entirety of \\"Bad Jubies\\". On August 15, 2014, Lepore submitted her storyboard for network approval, and, after gaining said approval, teamed up with Bix Pix Entertainment. This production company constructed all of the backdrops, props, and puppets, while Lepore directed the endeavor. The production of the episode presented many technical challenges which Lepore had limited experience dealing with. Because she had mostly taught herself how to animate, she soon had to learn specific industry methods that, for instance, prevented puppets from falling over, or shots from being interrupted by human error. Lepore directed four separate animators, who each worked on a different set; this allowed for four times as much footage to be captured in a single day. The episode's introduction, which Lepore animated almost entirely by herself, was the last piece of stop motion made for the show. According to Lepore, the fleeting characters that appear were made \\"quick and dirty\\" out of clay, since they only appeared briefly. The music for the episode was composed by electronic and chiptune artist Disasterpeace. In a Tumblr post, he wrote: > I had the pleasure of scoring Kirsten Lepore's guest directed, Emmy award- > winning episode of Adventure Time from Season 7, \\"Bad Jubies\\". This is one > of my favorite shows and I wanted to honor the feeling of open-ended > creativity I feel is often on display when watching it, so I set out to > create a collage aesthetic.

Note: Information taken from the show's > official Tumblr account. In terms of sampling, Lepore herself provided a collage of nature sounds. Reception \\"Bad Jubies\\" aired on January 14, 2016. It was seen by 1.22 million viewers and scored a 0.3 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic (Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States), which means that the episode was seen by 0.3 percent of all individuals aged 18 to 49 years old who were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\", arguing that the episode was both about \\"how the act of creation can alienate the artist from others, but ultimately unites people with the finished product\\", and a meditation on negativity, depression, and the beauty of the natural world. Sava was impressed with Lepore's handle on the characters and their voices, especially given that her previous short films had made little to no use of dialogue. He was also appreciative that while Lepore did bring a unique and striking change by using a new medium, tonally, the episode is consistent with other episodes of Adventure Time. Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the episode \\"catches the show's combination of cosmic consciousness and domestic farce and takes it some places you never knew you wanted it to go. It's everything a special should be.\\" He wrote highly of Lepore's medium, contrasting it with 3-D animation by saying, \\"In stop-motion, the space is real; the materials are real; their texture is not modeled texture but just, you know, texture. The light is light.\\" For his work on this episode, Jason Kolowski (the episode's production designer) won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation at the 68th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in 2016, making it the series's fifth win in this category. In late 2016, the episode and several of those who worked on it were also nominated for three Annie Awards. The episode itself was nominated for Best Animated TV/Broadcast Production for Children's Audience; Kirsten Lepore was nominated for Outstanding Achievement, Directing in an Animated TV/Broadcast Production; and Jason Kolowski was nominated for Outstanding Achievement, Production Design in an Animated TV/Broadcast Production. The episode won the Annie Award for Best Animated TV/Broadcast Production for Children's Audience.

Cases are formed from .458 SOCOM run through a custom .375 SOCOM sizing die.  History The .375 SOCOM is a fairly new cartridge, designed by Tromix in 2013. Taking a .458 SOCOM cartridge case and sizing the neck down to .375 caliber, resulted in a hard hitting AR-15 compatible cartridge, that has a considerable velocity and range advantage over the .458 SOCOM as well as other big bore AR-15 cartridges. Unknown to most, the .375 SOCOM has a sizeable case capacity, nearly 60 grains, that is on par with the .308 Winchester. Typical .375 SOCOM loads will launch a 200 grain bullet 2400 feet per second from a 20\\" barrel. In a short barrel suppressed subsonic application, the .375 SOCOM can be made to easily cycle the AR-15 action, using fairly fast burning propellants such as IMR 700X, Trail Boss and VV N32C (Tin Star). This can be problematic with the .458 SOCOM when barrels are shortened below 12\\". Typical powders for the .375 SOCOM include AR-Comp, AA2520, VV N530, VV N135, VV N140, IMR4895, Varget, Reloader 15, and H4895. Powders intended for the .458 SOCOM should not be used in the .375 SOCOM due to their burn rate being too fast for the .375. Availability Factory .375 SOCOM ammunition is currently available from MidwayUSA, SBR Ammunition, Black Butterfly, and Strike Force Ammunition. .375 SOCOM head stamped brass is available from SBR Ammunition and reloading dies are available from Tromix, Redding, CH4D, Hornady, and Lee. Reloaders can form their own .375 SOCOM brass using the parent .458 SOCOM case, but they must first run the cases through a .375 SOCOM full length size die. Reloading data is available directly from Tromix. Suitable component bullets are available from Sierra Bullets, Vollmer Bullets, Hawk Bullets, and Maker Bullets. The .375 SOCOM feeds from most all GI type 5.56 M16 magazines, however Magpul P-Mags are not recommended.

From 2014 to 2015, she worked on an episode of the American cartoon series Adventure Time entitled \\"Bad Jubies\\", serving as writer, storyboard artist, and director. The episode eventually aired on January 14, 2016 to critical acclaim. Education In an interview with The A.V. Club, Lepore explained that, as a child, she was fascinated by the animation techniques used by both Disney and the Jim Henson Company. In high school, she began to earnestly explore art, and as a young adult, she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts at Maryland Institute College of Art, where she studied \\"experimental animation\\". Her undergraduate thesis was the short stop motion film entitled \\"Sweet Dreams\\". Following college, she applied to studios and freelanced on the side, but she \\"never heard back from the studios, and the freelance work kept coming.\\" She returned to her parents' house and began working on ads and small production projects. During this phase in her life, she felt that she did not have enough technical expertise. As a result, she attended CalArts, graduating in 2012 with a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation. Her graduate thesis, a short film entitled \\"Move Mountain\\", caught the attention of Adventure Time showrunner Adam Muto, and Lepore eventually guest-animated the episode \\"Bad Jubies\\". Accolades Lepore has won various awards, including a Student Annie Award, a South by Southwest special jury award for animation, and an Annecy + award for best animation.

He played an important role in bringing Scottish settlers to Prince Edward Island, Canada. The son of Alexander M‚ÄôDonald of Glenaladale (often spelt Glenalladale), the head of the Glenaladale branch of the Clan Macdonald of Clanranald, and Margaret MacDonell of Scotus, he was born at Glenaladale and studied at the Catholic seminary at Regensburg. After his return to Scotland in 1761, he became the 8th laird of Glenaladale. Dissatisfied with his situation in Scotland, in 1771 he mortgaged his lands in Scotland to his cousin and purchased Lot 36 on St. John's Island (later Prince Edward Island) from the Lord Advocate Sir James Montgomery. In 1770, Colin MacDonald of Boisdale had begun to pressure his Catholic tenants on the island of South Uist to either convert to the Church of Scotland or vacate his property. So, with the support of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, MacDonald gathered a group of 210 settlers, including 110 from the mainland, who departed for St. John's Island in May 1772. A 1775 map of Prince Edward Island showing Lots 35, 36, and 37 on the far eastern north-shore of Queen's County MacDonald came to the settlement himself the following year by way of Philadelphia. In 1775, at the start of the American Revolution, he was made a company commander in the 2nd battalion of the Royal Highland Emigrants. His sister Helen took over management of the property on St. John's Island during his absence. In 1781, while MacDonald was still absent, Governor Walter Patterson confiscated some lots which had been in arrears for non-payment of quit-rents. Unaware that the lot which he owned was not affected, MacDonald went to London to protest; he was also upset because he had been interested in purchasing Lot 35. In the end, the Quit Rent Act of 1774 was repealed, the governor was recalled and the lands were returned to their former owners. MacDonald was also able to purchase Lot 35 from General Alexander Maitland. He was married twice: first to Isabella Gordon of Wardhouse and then, in 1792, to Margaret MacDonald of Ghernish. His son Donald later served in the Legislative Council of Prince Edward Island. MacDonald died on his estate at Tracadie in 1810. In 2012, MacDonald was named a Person of National Historic Significance by the Canadian government.

The 6888th had 855 black women, both enlisted and officers, and was led by Major Charity Adams Earley. It was the only all-black, all-female battalion overseas during World War II. The group motto was \\"No mail, low morale\\". The battalion was organized into five companies, Headquarters, Company A, Company B, Company C, and Company D. Most of the 6888th worked as postal clerks, but others were cooks, mechanics and held other support positions, so that the 6888th was a self-sufficient unit.  History  \\"The first Negro WACs to arrive (on) the continent of Europe were 800 girls of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Bn, w ‚Äì NARA ‚Äì 531333 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion African-American WACs, Hull & Cambridge, England, 04/14/1945 During World War II, there was a significant shortage of soldiers who were able to manage the postal service for the U.S. Army overseas. In 1944, Mary McLeod Bethune worked to get the support of first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, for \\"a role for black women in the war overseas.\\" Black newspapers, too, challenged the U.S. Army to \\"use black women in meaningful Army jobs.\\" The women who signed up went to basic training in Georgia. Women who were already in the WAC, like Alyce Dixon, served at different locations, including the Pentagon, before they joined the 6888th. = England = The 6888th left the United States on February 3, 1945, sailing on and arriving in Glasgow on February 12. √éle de France encountered several German U-boats on the trip, forcing the ship to take evasive maneuvers. The same day the battalion was transported by train to Birmingham., on 15 February, the battalion was inspected and marched in review before Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, Commanding General, Communications Zone, European Theater of Operations (ETO), and Maj Gen. Robert McGowan Littlejohn, Chief Quartermaster, ETO, part of whose command was mail. When the 6888th settled in at Birmingham, \\"they saw letters stacked to the ceiling of the temporary post office.\\" The temporary post office was located in converted hangars. Some letters had been in the makeshift offices for as long as two years. Army officials believed that undelivered mail was \\"hurting morale.\\" Many letters and packages were difficult to source, as they were addressed with only the first name of the soldier, had a commonly used name or used nicknames. Early in the operation, a white general attempted to send a white officer to \\"tell them how to do it right,\\" but Major Earley responded, \\"Sir, over my dead body, sir!\\" The battalion finished what was supposed to be a six-month task in three months in May 1945. The 6888th devised their own system to handle the backlog of mail. The women of the 6888th worked in three different shifts, seven days a week, processing and delivering mail ‚Äì a morale booster ‚Äì to fighting troops in Europe. Each shift handled an estimated 65,000 pieces of mail. It was cold when they arrived, and women wore long underwear and coats in the unheated buildings. The 6888th was a segregated unit, sleeping and eating in different locations from the white, male soldiers. They were housed in a former school building, with officers quartered in houses nearby. Some women felt that European \\"locals\\" treated them better than people did in the United States. A chaplain working at Birmingham caused problems for Earley, ordering her soldiers not to report to work, but to report to his office, causing them to be AWOL. Earley had to \\"'counsel' him to let the women alone,\\" reminding him that she was in charge of the women's assignments. = France = Once the backlog in Birmingham had been dealt with, the 6888th were shipped across the Channel to Le Havre in May 1945 and then were entrained to Rouen. The 6888th dealt with another backlog of mail in Rouen, some of the letters three years old. The military police in the WAC unit were not allowed to have weapons, so they used jujitsu to keep out \\"unwanted visitors.\\" They also participated in a parade ceremony at the place where Joan of Arc died. By October 1945, the mail in Rouen had been cleared and the 6888th was sent to Paris. They marched through Paris and were housed in a luxurious hotel, where they received first- class treatment. During this time, because the war was over, the battalion was reduced by 300 women, with 200 due to be discharged in January 1946. = Post- war = In February 1946, the unit returned to the United States where it was disbanded at Fort Dix, New Jersey. There was no public recognition for their service at the time.  Legacy  Members of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion were awarded the European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal during their service. On February 25, 2009, the battalion was honored at the Women in Military Service for America Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. The event was attended by three former unit members of the 6888th including Alyce Dixon, Mary Ragland, and Gladys Shuster Carter. Dixon and Ragland were also honored by President Barack Obama and first lady, Michelle Obama in 2009. On March 15, 2016, the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion was inducted into the U.S. Army Women's Foundation Hall of Fame. Battalion veteran Elsie Garris attended the Induction Ceremony. On November 30, 2018, Fort Leavenworth dedicated a monument to the women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion.

The Communist offensive, if successful, would knock the last remaining fighting troops of the Kingdom of Laos out of the war, ensuring the Vietnamese conquest of Laos. The PAVN 316th Divisionreinforced by artillery, tanks, and sappers attacked during a period of slackened tactical air support for General Vang Pao's guerrilla army; Operation Lam Son 719 was being waged at the same time. Having captured the highly strategic Plain of Jars during Operation 74B, the Communists attackers managed to penetrate deeply enough to fire upon the main guerrilla base at Long Tieng. Disaster was staved off by importing mercenary troops from the neighboring Kingdom of Thailand. Using aerial mobility to outmaneuver the Communists, the Royalists managed to stave off defeat until the Vietnamese had to withdraw due to lack of supplies. As the Communist offensive wilted, Vang Pao was pressured by his backers in Washington, D.C. to ramp down operations to encourage peace talks to settle the war. Vietnamization would soon cut his tactical air support still further. Yet the Communists were still poised to finish L'Armee Clandestine, and could not be ignored. The Hmong general compromised by staging an \\"active defense\\" of limited spoiling counterattacks to regain ground in the aftermath of Campaign 74B. Overview The French loss of the First Indochina War led to the establishment of the independent Kingdom of Laos by the 1954 Geneva Agreements. Laotian neutrality called for a ban on foreign military forces save for a French advisory mission. However, North Vietnamese troops had settled in northeastern Laos to support a Lao communist insurrection.Castle, pp. 7‚Äì12, 15‚Äì18.Dommen, pp. 30‚Äì34. Background A major theater of battle during the resulting Laotian Civil War was the Plain of Jars (PDJ). There Royalist Hmong guerrillas trained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and backed by air power fought it out with People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) regulars.Ahern, p. xiv. During 1969 and 1970, a series of seesaw battles were fought on and around the PDJ. Hmong General Vang Pao directed a series of offensives dependent on air superiority blasting a way for his guerrillas. The Communists staged their own counteroffensives.Warner, pp. 44‚Äì47 Vang Pao's Operation PigfatConboy, Morrison, pp. 201-208 and Operation Raindance were countered by the PAVN's Campaign Toan Thang. Vang Pao struck back with Operation Off Balance and Kou Kiet.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 210-217. The Communists retaliated with the massive combined arms Campaign 139, running from 13 September 1969 to 25 April 1970, which nearly won them the war.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 247-260. The aptly named monarchist Operation Counterpunch, fought from 26 September 1969 through 7 January 1971, barely kept the Royal Lao Government in the war.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 265-277. Order of battle The Plain of Jars, the location of Campaign 74B, is marked by the blue shading. Campaign 139 had marked the first use of combined arms in the Laotian Civil War. Campaign 74B was the second combined arms assault, though somewhat fewer troops were allotted for 74B. The PAVN units for 74B had previously fought in Campaign 139 over the same ground. They consisted of the 316th PAVN Division, the 866th Independent Regiment, the 165th Regiment from the 312th PAVN Division, and three Dac Cong sapper battalions, backed by artillery and tanks.Conboy, Morrison, p. 295. The major difference was that all, not part, of the 312th Division had participated in Campaign 139.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 248-249. Another difference was the shortage of ammunition for the PAVN caused by air interdiction of Communist supply lines.Anthony, Sexton, p. 341. Poised to fend off any attack was Task Force Vang Pao, a reinforced regiment of Thai mercenaries. They occupied three static positions in and around the vital guerrilla base of Long Tieng in Military Region 2; they also manned four separate artillery positions for fire support. One of these artillery units, at Ban Na, was also occupied by Bataillon Infanterie 15 (BI 15). Bataillon Infanterie 17 (BI 17) from the allied Forces Armee Neutralistes (FAN) garrisoned the forward fighter base at Muang Soui. Then there were three guerrilla regiments available for mobile operations. A Royalist guerrilla regiment, Groupement Mobile 23 (GM 23), was stationed nearby. Groupement Mobile 21 (GM 21) had been stationed at the old Project Momentum base at Ban Padong to recuperate from service in Operation Counterpunch. A third partisan regiment, GM 22, was stationed near Tha Tham Bleung.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 294-295. The Thai mercenaries were nearing the end of their year's assignment in Laosthis fact would have its effect on the unfolding tactical situation.Conboy, Morrison, p. 297. An important constituent of the Royalist strength was tactical air power. The Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF), backed by an all out effort by their Air Commando advisers, doubled their daily sortie rate to 44. 7th Air Force (7th AF) committed 48 daily sorties, with 12 more held ready as a quick reaction force. This was a sharp contrast to the 200 sorties per day of U.S. tactical air that had been available just a few months prior during Kou Kiet. There was a concerted effort to more efficiently use such U.S. air power as was received. For air strike control, the U.S. Air Attach√© promulgated a designated battle area (DBA) containing the Communist units threatening Long Tieng. The main Communist gun parks and troop staging areas could be bombed by jets using all-weather methods under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) in certain areas. Communist bases on the Plain of Jars, down to Ban Ban, and east along Route 7 to the North Vietnamese border were free fire zones. All other air strikes would be under the existing rules of engagement, which included targets being acquired, marked and directed by Raven Forward Air Controllers operating from Long Tieng's 20 Alternate airfield.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 310, 341. Campaign 74B =The Communist offensive= On 2 February 1971, the PAVN rained down a barrage of artillery fire on the Neutralists at the Moung Soui air base. Five of the PAVN PT-76 tanks closed for an assault. By 0600 hours 3 February, BI 17 was fleeing their stronghold, abandoning four 75mm howitzers. The Communists next attacked a Thai artillery position at Ban Na. To discourage close air support for the Thais, the North Vietnamese moved in heavy machine guns ringing the site for antiaircraft defense. They then shelled the encircled Thais with 85mm and 122mm artillery rounds. They also shelled a second Thai artillery position on Zebra Ridge, as well as a Thai infantry position atop Phou Long Mat. Foul weather, unusual for February, hindered flight operations. Taking advantage of the cloud cover, a battalion from the 866th Independent Regiment and a company of 41st Dac Cong Battalion moved down the Nam Bleung Valley. On 7 February, they struck GM 22. With the huge Operation Lam Son 719 offensive beginning against the Ho Chi Minh Trail on 8 February in southern Laos, the fighting in northern Laos suddenly rated only 24 sorties of tactical air support per day. While the Communist battalion tied up the guerrilla regiment, 1st Company of the 27th Dac Cong Battalion infiltrated past those Royalists. Beginning at midnight 13 February, Dac Cong commandos took the major guerrilla base at Long Tieng under fire with a DK-82 recoilless rifle. This threat to the vital Royalist stronghold was diversion for another element of Dac Cong. This latter element had circled to move in from the south, headed toward the King's villa; they destroyed a 105mm howitzer near it. The Dac Cong set up a mortar and began shelling Long Tieng. For the first time ever, the PAVN fired 122mm and 140mm rockets at the base. The chaotic situation was not helped by Vang Pao's overnight absence in Udorn, Thailand; the Hmong partisans of L'Armee Clandestine depended upon his orders. If the paucity of air support were not problematic enough, on 14 February,Robbins, pp. 323-332. an F-4 Phantom II inadvertently dropped cluster munitions on civilian dependents. Thirty Hmong women and children were killed; 170 wounded. A munitions dump, a mess hall, the CIA dormitory, all were struck. Vang Pao landed back at Long Tieng in the wake of this dispiriting disaster. Also arriving were two Thai mercenary battalions, Bataillon Commando 603 (BC 603) and Bataillon Commando 604 (BC 604) which were stationed on Skyline Ridge to ward off the Dac Cong sappers. With the PAVN onslaught moving southwestwards of the PDJ towards the Hmong heartland, Vang Pao thought of a diversionary effort east of the PDJ a la Operation Counterpunch III. Instead, his CIA backers supplied him with a guerrilla regiment imported from Military Region 3 to the south. Landed on 28 February 1971, Groupement Mobile 31 (GM 31) was tasked with sweeping north from Skyline Ridge overlooking Long Tieng. They swept north toward the refugee center at Sam Thong. However, the operation's start was delayed by insubordination among the troops. Desertions began from Bataillon Guerrier 318 (BG 318) and Bataillon Guerrier 308 (BG 308) on 6 March. BG 318 refused its duties for two days until they were paid their overdue salaries. BG 308 retreated to Long Tieng with a bill of complaints. They were appeased by relief of their commanding officer and the elevation of his deputy. Only after those matters were settled did the guerrillas resume operations.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 295-296. On 3 March, two more offensive Thai mercenary battalions, Bataillon Commando 605 (BC 605) and Bataillon Commando 606 (BC 606), landed at Long Tieng. Fending off Vang Pao's notion that the Thai units should be reduced to platoon-size reinforcements for Hmong guerrillas units, the CIA advisers lumped the newly arrived battalions together with the two battalions on Skyline Ridge as Task Force Singha. BCs 605 and 606 swept north to Sam Thong with little opposition.Conboy, Morrison, p. 296 On 9 and 10 March, BG 308 was helicoptered back to its line of departure at Sam Thong to resume moving towards its objective, the Nam Ngum (Ngum River). On 15 March, Task Force Singha gained two more Thai units, Bataillon Commando 601 (BC 601) and Bataillon Commando 602 (BC 602). The newly arrived battalions were directed against Phou Tham Seh, a high point three kilometers north of Skyline Ridge. Despite being overburdened with weighty weaponry, drenched by rain, and chilled by freezing nights, they took the ridge. On 19 March, BC 605 and BC 606 were helilifted into the Tha Tham Bleung Valley; their objective was nearby Ban Hintang. The next day, GM 31 reached the bank of the Nam Ngum. BC 605 and BC 606 would have no such luck in achieving their objective. They clashed twice with the PAVN before withdrawing southward on 27 March to friendly positions on Zebra Ridge. Meanwhile, during the furor of battle, Bataillon Artillerie 635 (BA 635) arrived to relieve the artillery positions on Zebra Ridge and the western end of Skyline Ridge. Brown smog from swidden farming clogged the atmosphere, inhibiting the use of such little air support that was available. However, the Thai artillery strongpoint at Ban Na had come under siege during the opening of Campaign 74B. Now the 165th Regiment from the 312th Division joined the attack. However, weather was not the only hindrance to close air support for the Thais; U.S. tactical air was also being diverted to bomb North Vietnam. Instead, BC 605 and BC 606 were tasked with seizing Hill 1663, four kilometers southwest of Ban Na. On 29 March, they lined up on the landing zone for insertion into a landing zone at the foot of Hill 1663. Forty troopers from BC 605 deserted rather than load up; they walked back to Long Tieng. The dutiful Thai troops were stalled at the base of the hill after they landed, fended off by a lightly manned PAVN defense. On 1 April, GM 31 was withdrawn from its quiet sector on the bank of the Nam Ngum; its new position was eight kilometers east of Sam Thong, protecting its flank. That same day, the Royalists assaulting Hill 1663 were reinforced by troops from Groupement Mobile 23 (GM 23), and took the hill on 1 April. A 105mm howitzer and a 4.2 inch mortar were emplaced on the hilltop as an improvised fire base. With Hill 1663 as a refuge for the besieged forces on Ban Na, BC 606 was ordered to direct a rescue march toward Ban Na on 3 April. As they lined up for the attack, a Phantom II dropped a 2,000-pound bomb on them. The friendly fire incident killed 16 Thais, including BC 605's commanding officer, and a company commander from BC 606. As a result of this accident, which aborted the relief expedition, it was decided to attach a forward air guide to each Thai battalion. Meanwhile, Bataillon Commando 604 (BC 604) reinforced the Hill 1663 stronghold. At 2100 hours on 6 April, with Vang Pao's consent, the besieged Thais abandoned Ban Na. However, instead of fleeing to Hill 1663, they moved south toward Bataillon Infanterie 14 (BI 14) atop Phou Long Mat, suffering middling casualties in the process. The loss of Ban Na relieved the last impediment to Communist control southeast of the Plain of Jars. =Vang Pao's dilemma= General Vang Pao now found himself in a strategic dilemma. Although his Operation Barrel Roll tactical air allotment had been temporarily increased to 60 daily sorties to support his operation, he knew Vietnamization would slash that quota on 1 July. The U.S. belief that Operation Lam Son 719 was best followed by ongoing interdiction strikes further cut his close air support. His American backers were urging him to go on the defensive as a means of aiding peace negotiations to end the Laotian Civil War. Yet the North Vietnamese were poised on the brink of victory; they had at least two more months dry weather for staging their attacks on Long Tieng, and they held the entire Plain of Jars for a staging area. To survive, the Hmong guerrillas had to at least wage limited spoiling offensives. Not only that, the Hmong Council of Elders had to be reassured that he was still fighting, lest the Elders provoke a migration of the community away from the war.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 297-299. On 18 April 1971, two battalions from two Hmong Groupement Mobiles (GMs) pushed 15 kilometers southeast from Ban Pa Dong to settle upon Pha Phai. In the midst of all this, Thai mercenary units still had to be rotated. On 20 April, two fresh Thai battalions, Bataillon Commando 608 (BC 608) and Bataillon Commando 609 (BC 609), relieved the troops at Hill 1663. At Phou Long Mat, two fresh battalions, BC 603 and BC 607, extended their position two kilometers further northwards by capturing Hill 1900 from the PAVN. On 23 April, Hmong guerrillas were landed northwest of Phou Phasai to besiege the PAVN on the hill.Conboy, Morrison, p. 298. By the end of April, the hilltop stronghold of Phou Phasai had fallen to the Royalist guerrillas. That same day, the PAVN ended Operation 74B. Aftermath On 1 May 1971, GM 21 was helilifted out of Ban Pa Dong ten kilometers north to Khang Kho. On 3 May, GM 22 was lifted into Ban Pa Dong as replacements. The two guerrilla regiments were now poised to move on the Lat Sen airstrip and to link up with GM 23 to take the mountaintop positions at Phou Seu, in a repeat of Kou Kiet.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 299-300. In mid-May 1971, GM 31 finally cleared the last platoon of PAVN troops from Zebra Ridge, near Long Tieng. On 21 May, it marched to Long Tieng, to be flown back to MR 3 two days later. By the end of May, the PAVN units of the 316th began to slowly recede back upon their lines of communications into North Vietnam. The 148th PAVN Regiment hung on and formed a pocket of resistance near Phousai, one of several. Some of the retreating PAVN troops subjected nearby Bouamlong to an intense but unsuccessful assault. Three Pathet Lao battalions were left to maintain a Communist presence near Bouamlong by the end of May, and the PAVN retained launching points near Long Tieng for future offensives. In late May, Undersecretary of Defense John Irwin visited Long Tieng. While he was there, Vang Pao briefed him on an offensive being planned. Chief of Station Hugh Tovar submitted a proposal on this to Headquarters. He was advised to be circumspect, as the U.S. Senate was about to be briefed in closed session about military activities in Laos.Ahern, p. 425. Vang Pao now had the month of June before the U.S. tactical air power available to him would drastically diminish. He also had problematic military politics to consider. General Creighton Abrams, U.S. Army (USA), had more clout in Washington, D.C. than General Vang Pao, Royal Lao Army (RLA). Abrams favored Vang Pao's fighting a holding action while awaiting a ceasefire. Vang Pao knew that his hodge podge irregular army of tribal guerrillas and Thai mercenaries were the last Royalist fighting forces in the Kingdom. And with a decade of experience in trying to hold fixed positions with guerrillas, he knew there was little chance L'Armee Clandestine could stand off a combined arms assault by PAVN regulars.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 298-299. Yet with the RLA regulars no longer waging war, L'Armee Clandestine was the Kingdom's last defense.Castle, p. 111. Vang Pao rendered lip service to Washington's desires. However, the U.S. Embassy, which actually controlled the Laotian Civil War and were closer to its realities, sympathized with Vang Pao. He sold them on the necessity for a limited counter-offensive to establish a viable defensive line. In turn, they told Washington that Vang Pao planned an \\"active defense\\". With embassy backing, he parachuted in 45 Commando Raiders to interdict the Communist supply line, Route 7. On 3 June, a battalion from GM 21 was helicoptered from Khang Kho to the base of Phou Seu to attack that Communist strongpoint. Eight other Hmong guerrilla battalions swept north and east onto the Plain, capturing Communist supply caches.Anthony, Sexton, p. 343. By 12 June, the hilltop position at Phou Louang had been captured by GM 22, and a fire support base set up on its summit. BC 604 and two 105mm howitzers were airlifted in to extend the artillery's range onto the Plain to the northwest. GM 22 joined GM 21 to overrun the village and airstrip at Lat Sen. Bataillon Guerrilla 224 (BG 224) was lifted in to occupy Lat Sen. GM 22 continued through Lat Sen to Phou Theung, which was vacant of Communist troops. Two 105mm howitzers were airlifted into the base of Phou Theung to support an assault. However, on 18 June, a PAVN infantry counterattack destroyed the guns. The PAVN then lapsed into inactivity.Conboy, Morrison, p. 300. On 24 June, BC 609 was transferred via air from Hill 1663 to Phou Theung, freeing GM 22 to move eastward to interdict Route 4. GM 21 and BG 224 were directed eight kilometers northeastward to occupy Lat Houang and the adjacent intersection of Routes 4 and 5. The newly formed Groupement Mobile 24 (GM 24), accompanied by CIA adviser George Bacon, was committed and ended its sweep by occupying Phou Seu on 29 June 1971. Three days later another newly trained unit, Bataillon Commando 610 (BC 610), garrisoned the twin peaks. Results At this point, Vang Pao's limited offensive had extended his defensive positions to the edge of the Plain, with artillery fire reaching out onto the Plain. Phou Theung had been captured without seeking agreed upon advance approval from Henry Kissinger; he was informed that Vang Pao had only given notice of that offensive move after it was in progress. Nevertheless, both the State Department and CIA Headquarters were uneasy about King Sisavang Vatthana and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma pushing Vang Pao into an unacceptably risky offensive.Ahern, pp. 427-428.

History Historically, even in countries such as the United States and Singapore, it has taken significant time for REITs to pick up. Objective Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) aimed at attracting funds in a transparent manner into the real estate sector. Types There are two types of Business Trusts which can be formed in India. =Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)= A REIT, structured as a real estate counterpart to mutual funds, allows small investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of rent-yielding realty assets. Specialist REITs like Alexandria and Prologis focused on healthcare research and industrial assets have come of age in the US. The total estimated rental income potential of commercial Grade A stock in top eight Indian cities is by 2019, according to global real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield. =Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)= It is almost same as Real Estate Investment Trust. The only difference is that the investment done here by the business trust is in infrastructure like roads, bridges, etc. SEBI guidelines The guidelines, approved by its Sebi board, have kept the minimum requirement for asset sizes permitted to be listed in India at . The minimum issue size of the initial public offer shouldn't be less than . Taxation As a benefit, any dividend would be tax exempt in the hands of the business trust and the dividend component of the income distributed by the business trust would also be exempt in the hands of unit holder. Any interest received by business trust from SPV is taxable in hands of Unit holder with Normal Tax rate slab (as per Income Tax Act, 1961) and 5% in case of Non resident or foreign Companies.

Scientific influence The pioneering submarine designer Simon Lake credited his inspiration to Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and his autobiography begins \\"Jules Verne was in a sense the director-general of my life.\\" William Beebe, Sir Ernest Shackleton, and Robert Ballard found similar early inspiration in the novel, and Jacques Cousteau called it his \\"shipboard bible\\". The aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont named Verne as his favorite author and the inspiration for his own elaborate flying machines. Igor Sikorsky often quoted Verne and cited his Robur the Conqueror as the inspiration for his invention of the first successful helicopter. The rocketry innovators Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, and Hermann Oberth are all known to have taken their inspiration from Verne's From the Earth to the Moon. Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders, the astronauts on the Apollo 8 mission, were similarly inspired, with Borman commenting \\"In a very real sense, Jules Verne is one of the pioneers of the space age\\". When cosmonaut Georgi Grechko was orbiting Earth with Yuri Romanenko on the Salyut 6 in 1978, he broadcast back a message to celebrate Verne's 150th birthday, saying: \\"There's hardly a person who hasn't read his books, at any rate not among the cosmonauts, because Jules Verne was a dreamer, a visionary who saw flights in space. I'd say this flight too was predicted by Jules Verne.\\" Polar explorer Richard E. Byrd, after a flight to the South Pole, paid tribute to Verne's polar novels The Adventures of Captain Hatteras and An Antarctic Mystery by saying \\"It was Jules Verne who launched me on this trip.\\" Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer, was in his youth fascinated by Verne's novels, especially From the Earth to the Moon and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Their influence was so strong that, like Verne, Hubble gave up the career path in law that his father intended for him, setting off instead to pursue his passion for science. The preeminent speleologist √âdouard-Alfred Martel noted in several of his scientific reports that his interest in caves was sparked by Verne's Mathias Sandorf. Another influential speleologist, Norbert Casteret, traced his love of \\"caverns, abysses and underground rivers\\" to his avid youthful reading of Journey to the Center of the Earth, calling it \\"a marvelous book, which impressed and fascinated me more than any other\\", and adding \\"I sometimes re-read it still, each time finding anew the joys and enthusiasm of my childhood\\". The French general Hubert Lyautey took much inspiration from the explorations in Verne's novels. When one of his more ambitious foreign projects was met with the reply \\"All this, sir, it's like doing a Jules Verne\\", Lyautey famously responded: \\"Yes, sir, it's like doing a Jules Verne, because for twenty years, the people who move forward have been doing a Jules Verne.\\" David Hanson named the Artificial Intelligence conversational character robot designed and built by him Jules in memory of Jules Verne. It is able to speak and respond in a human like manner, based on what it hears and has facial muscles that react to speech. Other scientific figures known to have been influenced by Verne include Fridtjof Nansen, Wernher von Braun, Guglielmo Marconi, and Yuri Gagarin. Literary influence Cover of L'Algerie Magazine, June 15, 1884. The text reads \\"M. Jules Verne: going to the best sources for authentic information on the underwater world.\\" Arthur Rimbaud was inspired to write his well-known poem \\"Le Bateau ivre\\" after reading Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, which he extensively alludes to within the poem; The Adventures of Captain Hatteras was likely an additional source of inspiration. In the 1920s, many members of the Surrealist movement named Verne as one of their greatest and most imaginative precursors. Eug√®ne Ionesco said that all of his works, whether directly or indirectly, were written in celebration of Captain Hatteras's conquest of the North Pole. Another surrealist, the Greek poet Andreas Embirikos, paid tribute to Verne in his nine-volume magnum opus The Great Eastern (Megas Anatolikos, 1990), which borrows from Verne's A Floating City and includes Verne himself among its characters. Raymond Roussel was profoundly influenced both thematically and stylistically by Verne, whom he called a \\"man of incommensurate genius\\" and an \\"incomparable master\\", adding that in many passages Verne \\"raised himself to the highest peaks that can be attained by human language.\\" Jean Cocteau cited both Around the World in Eighty Days and Verne's own 1874 dramatization of it as major childhood influences, calling the novel a \\"masterpiece\\" and adding \\"Play and book alike not only thrilled our young imagination but, better than atlases and maps, whetted our appetite for adventure in far lands. ‚Ä¶ Never for me will any real ocean have the glamour of that sheet of green canvas, heaved on the backs of the Ch√¢telet stage-hands crawling like caterpillars beneath it, while Phileas and Passepartout from the dismantled hull watch the lights of Liverpool twinkling in the distance.\\" Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, who discovered the Voyages extraordinaires as a child and became one of Verne's enthusiastic adult proponents in the first half of the 20th century, used Verne's The Black Indies as inspiration for his own novel Night Flight. The French experimental writer Georges Perec ardently read and reread Verne's works from adolescence onward, and allusions to Verne appear in many of his novels, including Life A User's Manual, A Gallery Portrait, and W, or the Memory of Childhood. Perec once commented: \\"When Jules Verne lists all the names of fish over four pages in Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas, I feel as though I am reading a poem.\\" The Swiss traveler and writer Nicolas Bouvier cited Verne as his initiation into geography, and named Mathias Sandorf and Phileas Fogg among his childhood heroes. The British traveler and filmmaker Graham Hughes has similarly identified Fogg as one of his inspirations. According to scholarly hypothesis, J.R.R. Tolkien was inspired by Verne during the writing of his Legendarium narratives. The Tolkien scholar Mark T. Hooker and the philosopher Roderick Long have both written that the parallels between The Hobbit and Journey to the Center of the Earth are likely too extensive to have arisen simply by chance (both include a hidden runic message and a celestial alignment directing the adventurers to their goal, among other parallels), and the Verne scholar William Butcher has noted similar narrative parallels between The Lord of the Rings and The Adventures of Captain Hatteras. In an introduction to a biography of Verne, Arthur C. Clarke wrote: \\"Jules Verne had already been dead for a dozen years when I was born. Yet I feel strongly connected to him, and his works of science fiction had a major influence on my own career. He is among the top five people I wish I could have met in person.\\" The English novelist Margaret Drabble was deeply influenced by Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea as a child and remains a fervent admirer of Verne. She comments: \\"I used to be somewhat ashamed of my love of Verne, but have recently discovered that he is the darling of the French avant-garde, who take him far more seriously than we Anglo-Saxons do. So I'm in good company.\\" Ray Bradbury counted Verne as a main influence on his own fiction as well as on literature and science the world over, saying \\"We are all, in one way or another, the children of Jules Verne.\\" Other literary figures known to have been influenced by Verne include Paul Claudel, Fran√ßois Mauriac, Blaise Cendrars, Jean-Paul Sartre, Marcel Aym√©, Ren√© Barjavel, Claude Roy, Michel Butor, and Roland Barthes. Verne is also often cited as a major influence of the science fiction genre steampunk, though Verne's works themselves are not of the genre. Monuments and tributes Monument to Verne at the Jardin des Plantes in Nantes * Because Verne was a longtime resident of Amiens, many places there are named after him, such as the Cirque Jules Verne. Amiens is the place where Verne is buried, and the house where he lived is now a museum. There is also the Jules Verne Museum in Nantes. * A restaurant in the Eiffel Tower in Paris is named \\"Le Jules Verne\\". In June 1989, the Jules Verne Food Court opened at the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the West Midlands of England; however, it had closed by the mid-1990s due to disappointing trade. * In 1961, a large impact crater on the far side of the Moon was named Jules Verne in tribute to the writer. * In 1970, the University of Picardie Jules Verne was founded in Amiens. A public francophone secondary school in Vancouver was founded and named √âcole secondaire Jules-Verne in 2007. * The express train running between Nantes and Paris from 1980 to 1989 was named Jules Verne in the writer's honor. Two French ships were also named after him, and the international prize for around the world sailing records is named the Jules Verne Trophy. * In 1999, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Verne in its fourth annual class of two deceased and two living persons, citing him for having \\"helped shape and found modern science fiction.\\" Verne is one of three inductees who contributed prior to 1900 (Wells, Verne and Mary Shelley preceded all other inductees by about one, two, and three generations) and one of two from outside the Anglophone world (the French artist Jean Giraud was inducted in 2011). * On 9 March 2008, the European Space Agency launched an uncrewed cargo spacecraft named the Jules Verne ATV on a mission to bring supplies and cargo to the International Space Station. In homage to Verne's astronomical writings, the craft carried two handwritten manuscript pages from Verne's files as well as a Hetzel double edition of From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon published in Verne's lifetime. * In 2011, Google commemorated Jules Verne's 183rd birthday by featuring a Google Doodle based on his works. * CMA CGM Jules Verne, one of the largest container ships in the world, was named for him in 2013. *The Jules Verne trophy is awarded to the fastest circumnavigation of the world by sailboat, as a reference of the novel Around the world in eighty days. References in popular culture *In the film Back to the Future Part III (1990), Doc Emmett Brown's children are named Jules and Verne, and Dr. Brown invented a time machine (DeLorean). *Jules Verne appeared in the Transformers: Rescue Bots series episode \\"Last of Morocco\\", where he is revealed to be the estranged friend of recurring series antagonist Thaddeus Morocco. He is also a time traveler, having discovered a means of moving through the ages using a device of his own invention and Energon, the power source of all Transformers. After being contacted by his old friend, Verne travels to the present day, meets the Rescue Bots, and reveals that he has encountered other Transformers during his travels through time. At the time that he meets the series' heroes, he has not yet written 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but later becomes determined to do so after taking a trip in a submarine. In a paradox, Morocco has a submarine called the Nemo that he presumably named for Jules Verne's character, whom Verne presumably named after the adventure involving the submarine. As a result of the episode's events, Verne takes Morocco - whose memories have been erased so that he no longer remembers his villainous career - to the future to live. *JV- The Extraordinary Adventures of Jules Verne is an Italian animated television series that recounts the fictionalized adventures of Jules Verne at age 16. *Jules Verne has influenced various Japanese steampunk anime and manga works, notably Hayao Miyazaki's anime productions such as Future Boy Conan (1979), Castle in the Sky (1986) and Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (1990). Nadia is loosely based on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, with Captain Nemo making an appearance.

In one legend, Afghan King Taimur Lung accompanied Egyptian and Syrian potters during his campaign in the Khurja region over 500 years ago. In another legend, potters had been moved to the region during Mughal Empire while another version says there we no long historical events in accordance with pottery tradition in Khurja.

Further mentioned, \\"These potters often call themselves as Multani Kumhars suggesting that their origin was Multan\\". Modern-day pottery manufacture flourished in the 1940s, and the Uttar Pradesh government set up a pottery factory in 1942. Later, the factory was closed in 1946‚Äì47 due to lack of quality. In 1952, the factory was changed as Pottery Development Centre.

He is an important figure in the musical history of England, his love of music driving him to acquire and copy musical manuscripts from some of the most important composers of the Renaissance, resulting in a unique performing collection of 16th-century house music that included works by William Byrd, Thomas Tallis, John Taverner, and Orlando di Lasso. He was especially interested in Byrd, and one of his books is the largest source of consort songs by that composer. Paston played the lute, creating a wide range of vocal settings and accompanying tablatures in partbooks that are still obtainable. As a young man he travelled extensively in Spain, being influenced by the Spanish (and Italian) form of tablature, as seen in his partbooks, rather than the generally used French form. It is believed that the part-books were specially prepared for him, rather than being 'commercially' acquired, in order to suit the performing requirements of his household, thus becoming material tailored to his specific needs. The broad range of music includes motets, madrigals, extracts from masses, and consort songs. In his will, Paston relates that there are various lute books intabulated in the Italian, French, and English styles, both for solo playing and as accompaniment for singing. He also mentions a chest containing sets of Latin, French, and Italian songs, from three- to eight-part versions, that are not yet printed and which he bequeaths to his son, William, until his grandson, Thomas reaches his eighteenth birthday, when they pass into his keeping. Many of these books are now housed in the British Library (formerly in the British Museum), and the Royal College of Music, London.  References   Sources  * Brett, Philip (2006).

It was built in the 3rd century during the reign of emperor Septimius Severus. Its ruins later became one of the main attractions of Palmyra until it was officially destroyed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in 2015. Most of its stonework still survives and there are plans to rebuild it using anastylosis. History Great Colonnade and the Monumental Arch. The Monumental Arch was built sometime during the reign of Emperor Septimius Severus, which lasted from 193 to 211 AD; it linked the main street of the Colonnade and the Temple of Bel. The arch was meant to integrate the southern and central parts of the Colonnade as its location marks a change of 30¬∞ in the orientation of the street between the Tetrapylon and the Temple of Bel, so to solve this problem the arch incorporated two fa√ßades angled apart from one another. According to some sources, the structure was built as a triumphal arch to commemorate the Romans' victories over the Parthians. The structure was sometimes erroneously referred to as \\"Hadrian's Arch\\", although Emperor Hadrian had been dead for over half a century when the arch was built. The ruins of the arch, along with other monuments in Palmyra, were depicted in engravings by the British traveller Robert Wood, which were published in London in 1753 under the title The ruins of Palmyra; otherwise Tedmor in the desart. The Monumental Arch was restored in the 1930s. When the ruins of Palmyra became a tourist attraction in the 20th and early 21st centuries, the arch was one of the city's main sights. Architecture Great Colonnade The Monumental Arch was unusual from an architectural viewpoint, since it had a double fa√ßade, masking a 30¬∞ bend between the eastern and central sections of the Great Colonnade. The arch consisted of a large gateway in the centre flanked by a smaller opening on either side. The arch was decorated with ornate stone carvings, including reliefs depicting plants or geometrical designs. These were similar to those found on other arches built during Severus' reign elsewhere in the Roman Empire, such as at Leptis Magna in modern-day Libya. The reliefs on the arch were described by UNESCO as \\"an outstanding example of Palmyrene art,\\" and they make it one of the most lavishly adorned monuments in the city. Destruction Palmyra was captured by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in May 2015. The militants booby- trapped the arch some time later, and on 4 October it was reported that the arch had been blown up using dynamite. Footage released on 8 October showed that half of the structure was still standing, but by the time of the recapture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army in March 2016, very little of the arch remained standing. The Office of the President of Syria as well as the director-general of UNESCO condemned the destruction of the Monumental Arch. According to the United Nations, the destruction showed that ISIL was \\"terrified by history and culture.\\" In March 2016, director of antiquities Maamoun Abdelkarim stated that the Monumental Arch, along with the Temples of Bel and Baalshamin, will be rebuilt using existing remains, a process called anastylosis. According to a Syrian official, reconstructing the arch would not be difficult since many of its stones still survive. A replica of the central part of the Monumental Arch was carved out of Egyptian marble in Italy by machinery using a 3D computer model by the Institute for Digital Archaeology in Oxford, England. The replica was installed in Trafalgar Square, London on 19 April 2016. It was displayed there for three days, before being moved to a number of other locations, including New York City, Florence, Geneva, Washington, D.C. and Dubai. It is to be sent to Syria afterwards.

The Bedford Automile was officially created in 1956 by the Bedford Automile Dealers Association to create a unified group to speak for the car dealerships in the area. It has since grown to include 26 new and used car dealerships and currently employs about 1,700 employees. It is widely regarded as one of the largest congregations of car dealerships in Ohio. The Bedford Automile got its start when Lynn L. Horton and his brother, Ralph E. Horton, opened the first car dealership in Bedford in the early 1920s. The original dealership sold Ford Motor Company cars, but quickly expanded to offer other makes of cars, such as Chevrolet, De Soto and Plymouth. Eventually the Horton brothers went into business with another brother, William Horton, and friends Floyd Mosher and Thomas Lally. This resulted in the dealerships eventually being renamed to Mosher-Lally, and later as Lally Chevrolet. Lally Chevrolet still operates in Bedford on the Bedford Automile under the name of Tim Lally Chevrolet. (Tim Lally is a descendant of Thomas Lally.) As the success of the car sales in Bedford increased, other car dealers opened new dealerships around the original car dealership, expanding along Broadway Avenue. This grouping of car dealerships eventually formed the Bedford Automile Dealers Association. This group not only works to represent its interests in the Bedford area, but also donates heavily to the surrounding community, schools and city to help maintain the integrity of the surrounding area. In April 2013, the city of Bedford established monuments to the historic Automile.

It is not particularly independent, because about 750 metres to the north rises the higher summit of the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel (3,081 m). Formerly the 3,008 spot height on the ar√™te between the two peaks was named as the Gleirscher Rosskogel, and this is still the case on many maps; in which case the present Gleirscher Rosskogel would then be called the Gleirscher Rosskopf. At the top is a small metal summit cross with a plaque inscribed with the present name of the peak and an elevation of 2,950 m.  Location  The Gleirscher Rosskogel is situated on the crest between the Zwieselbach valley (Zwieselbachtal) to the west as the Gleirsch valley (Gleirschtal) to the east. The former is a side valley of the Horlach valley (Horlachtal) which opens into the √ñtztal below Niederthai. The Gleirsch is a side valley of the Sellrain. The lowest point of the north-south ridge between the Zwieselbacher and Gleirscher Rosskogel is at a height of 2,946 m. Southeast of the summit is the col of Gleischrj√∂chl (2,750 m), which separates the Gleirscher Rosskogel from the Schartkopf (2,831 m), also called the Samerschlag, and the Zwieselbacher Grie√ükogel (3,066 m).  Ascent options  The easiest ascent option is via the col of Gleischrj√∂chl southeast of the summit. This may be reached either from the Schweinfurter Hut to the west or the New Pforzheim Hut to the east. From the col the route runs northwest over a flat ar√™te shoulder to the top. From the Pforzheim Hut it takes about 2¬Ω hours to the top, from the Schweinfurter Hut it is just under 2¬æ hours. The whole route from both huts is waymarked. A crossing from the Gleirscher Rosskogel to the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel, 750 metres north, is also possible. The most difficult section of the ridge, especially the steep step immediately south of the main peak was made safer in 2010 by members of the Pforzheim Branch of the Alpine Club by the installation of appropriate climbing aids. In addition, th route is marked as the Via Mandani throughout. In spite of the climbing aids the ar√™te, which is rather exposed in places, requires grade II climbing on the UIAA scale. The Gleirscher Rosskogel may also be climbed as part of a ski tour, but is not as popular as its northern neighbour, the Zwieselbacher Rosskogel. The Gleirscher Rosskogel is usually approached from St. Sigmund im Sellrain via the Pforzheimer Hut and the col immediately north of the summit and not via the Gleischrj√∂chl as in summer.

Paulospelled \\"Falha de S. Paulo\\", with a space before \\"Paulo\\", unlike \\"Folha de S.Paulo\\", spelled without the space. was a Brazilian humorous website devoted to satirize Brazilian Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. The website was maintained by brothers Lino and Mario Bocchini (journalist and designer, respectively) and was shut down after Folha sued them claiming they used their brand inappropriately by trying to mimic their graphic project, font and logo. Both brothers, however, accused the newspaper of trying to censor them and received support from multiple personalities and organizations.  The website  Brothers Lino (left) and Mario (right) Bocchini, creators of the website. Here, they are depicted on the day of an audience about the case at the Court of Law of the State of S√£o Paulo. The website was put on air on September 2010. It featured a logo identical to that of Folha, except that the first \\"o\\" was replaced by an \\"a\\" so that it read \\"Falha de S. Paulo\\", which translates as \\"Failure of S. Paulo\\". The website would make fun of the newspaper's coverage, specially of what they perceived to be a tendency of the newspaper in favor of Jos√© Serra and against Dilma Rousseff during the 2010 Brazilian presidential rally in which both of them faced each other on the second round. The Bocchini criticized the fact that Folha, unlike O Estado de S. Paulo and CartaCapital, for example, would not declare its political preferences and even claimed not to have one. Besides making fun of the newspaper's coverage, they would also make edited pictures such as one in which Folha's director, Ot√°vio Frias Filho, was dressed like Darth Vader, a villain in the Star Wars franchise.  Preliminary injunction and lawsuit  Audience at the Court of Law of the State of S√£o Paulo in February 2013 to discuss the case. In October, Folha obtained a preliminary injunction which determined the deactivation of the website, claiming inappropriate usage of their brand. They also filed a lawsuit for personal injury. The injunction, given to Mario at the first day of October 2010, imposed a R$1,000 fine for every day the brothers fail to keep the website down - less than the R$10,000 originally requested by the newspaper. On 4 October, the brothers were informed by Registro.br (the entity that manages all domains ending with .br) that the domain www.falhadespaulo.com.br would remain shot down to comply with the injunction. In a May 2011 audience, Folha, through its legal representative Ta√≠s Gasparian, said it wouldn't mind if the website was back online as long as long as the brothers refrained from using the newspaper's graphical project, logo, font, etc. The Bocchini rejected the offer, claiming it would impede the parodies, and counter-offered the option of having a disclaimer near the logo warning readers that they were not browsing the newspaper's website. The newspaper did not reply to the offer immediately, but promised to do it later. In 2013, the case was taken to the Court of Justice of the State of S√£o Paulo, which decided to maintain the decision of its lower court, reverberating the brand usage rights argument. In 2015, the case made it to the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice, where it awaits minister Marco Buzzi.  Reactions  Multiple personalities and organizations expressed support to the brothers and/or criticized Folha's decision to sue them. Among people who commented on the case are WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange; then host of CQC, Marcelo Tas, and Casseta & Planeta host, Cl√°udio Manoel; musician and ex- minister of culture Gilberto Gil; and journalists Juremir Machado da Silva, Guilherme Scalzilli, Lu√≠s Nassif and Celso Lungaretti. The non-governmental organization Reporters Without Borders published a note asking Folha to rethink its decision and pointing that while the newspaper could afford good lawyers, the brothers were experiencing financial difficulties to finance their defense. The note also accused the traditional media, \\"controlled by a handful of influential families\\" of ignoring the case. The NGO also said that Folha's attempt to \\"financially asphyxiate a media outlet\\" represented \\"a new form of censorship\\" and that its end could open \\"a dangerous precedent in terms of right of caricature, part of the freedom of expression and opinion.\\" The Professional Journalists of S√£o Paulo Union took part of a protest that demonstrated against, among other things, the justice's decision of demand to shut down Falha. A group of bloggers started a movement called \\"censura eu, Folha\\" (censor me, Folha) in response to the case. The case was the theme of an audience at the Participatory Legislation Commission at the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil on 27 October 2011. Suzana Singer, then Folha's ombudsman, wrote in her column at Folha itself that she recognizes the newspaper's right to preserve its brand, but that she believes the maneuver caused more damage to the newspaper than to the website: By the end of 2010, the Bocchini published what would be an e-mail by Singer sent to Folha journalists. In her message, she supposedly commented the repercussion of the case in many outlets (including international ones) and ended stating that \\"the newspaper should write about the lawsuit, make a story with both sides of the case and better explain its position. It's no longer possible to pretend nothing is happening.\\" When confronted by Lino Bocchini, Folha's executive editor S√©rgio D√°vila denied that the company was acting towards the website's censorship and strengthened the argument of brand preservation:  Desculpe a Nossa fAlha and websites hosting Falha's content  After the website's end, the Boccini decided to keep website about the case called Desculpe a Nossa fAlha (Excuse Our fAilure), where they publicize their version of the facts, upload documents relating to the lawsuit and a clipping of the case's repercussion in Brazil and in the world. Despite the website's end, some people started blogs and social media pages to host part of the lost content of Falha de S. Paulo.

They are named \\"Peterhouse\\" after Peterhouse in Cambridge, where the books were kept for some time, and are now preserved in the Cambridge University Library. They are handwritten manuscripts, all written on paper. At some point in the mid-eighteenth century, the books were rebound, although the foliation and indices remained unchanged.Stanley Boorman, et al. \\"Sources, MS.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed February 5, 2016.  Partbooks  In partbook format, each of the voice parts has its own book; hence, here, there are separate books for the Triplex, Medius, Contratenor, Tenor, Bassus, and Organ parts. Partbooks were a practical way of circulating polyphony; each voice part could be copied much more quickly in separate volumes than in score format, individual books used less paper overall than one single volume in score format, they were cheaper to produce and easier for larger groups to sing from, and each singer only needed to carry one smaller volume. However, the disadvantage to the partbook format is that a small individual volume was easy to lose, and if any of the partbooks went missing, the others were potentially rendered useless. Such is the case with the Peterhouse partbooks; only seventeen currently survive out of what appears to have originally been twenty-three books.  Content  The partbooks can be divided up into two separate collections. The \\"Henrician\\" set consists of four surviving books (Triplex, Medius, Contratenor, and Bassus, MS. 31‚Äì32 and 40‚Äì41), with the Tenor book missing and with several pages missing from the beginning of the Triplex. These books contain pieces exclusively set in Latin; they were all written by a single scribe between 1539 and 1541, and do not seem to have been used much, as there are numerous errors that were never corrected. As such, it is possible that they were copied more as an anthology than a set for practical or current use, and as the English Reformation and the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII continued, it may be that much of the repertory preserved in the partbooks fell from favor, or would have been considered politically ill-advised, shortly thereafter. The \\"Caroline\\" set consists of nineteen books (MS. 31‚Äì53, minus the Henrician set listed above), four of which (two Tenor books, MS. 50 and 52, and two Contratenor books, MS. 51 and 53) have been lost. This collection dates to between 1625 and 1640, although they were assembled together later, and is much more diverse than the Henrician set. The books contain pieces in both Latin and English, including Services, and were copied by numerous scribes of varying ability, several of whom are composers of works in this set of partbooks. The two sets are numbered inconsistently due to the order in which they were re-discovered. They were found, described, and catalogued by John Jebb, rector of Peterstown, Herefordshire, in the 1850s, at which point they were rebound in their current format.Sandon, Nicholas: The Henrican Partbooks Belonging to Peterhouse, Cambridge (Cambridge, University Library, Peterhouse Manuscripts 471‚Äì474): A Study, with Restorations of the Incomplete Compositions Contained In Them (PhD, University of Exeter, 1983) Some of the partbooks were found much later than others; three of those from the Caroline set, for example, were located in 1926 in a space behind the panelling of the Perne library, where presumably they had been hidden to protect them from the Puritans. Additionally, a second numbering system was applied to photocopies made of the partbooks, though these were made after the four lost books of the Caroline set went missing. The music preserved in the partbooks is entirely sacred, consisting of Masses, Magnificats, Services, anthems, and motets. The partbooks are exceptional for their preservation both of famous composers, such as Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, and Robert Fayrfax, and much lesser-known composers such as Arthur Chamberlayne, John Darke, John Norman, and Johann Hector Beck. Only two works in the Henrician set are by non-English composers: the motet \\"Aspice Domine\\" is elsewhere ascribed to Jacquet de Mantua, and a Mass based on the motet \\"Surrexit pastor bonus\\" by Andreas de Silva is labeled by a \\"Lupus Italus\\" in the partbooks, but it is unclear who this composer might be. A complete list of the composers represented in the Peterhouse partbooks is given below. The Peterhouse partbooks are related to other contemporary groups of partbooks, including the Forrest-Heyther (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Mus.Sch.e.376‚Äì81), Christ Church (Oxford, Christ Church Library, Mus.979‚Äì83), Wanley (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Mus.Sch.e.420‚Äì22) and Gyffard (London, British Library, Add.17802‚Äì5) partbooks, as well as British Museum Royal Appendix MSS. 45‚Äì48, among others.

Nicholas Sandon, however, has spent numerous years researching the Peterhouse partbooks and has devoted considerable time to reconstructing lost vocal parts. Sandon was formerly Professor of Music at University College, Cork and at Exeter University, and now acts as general editor of Antico Edition, which is publishing his reconstructions of the music found in the Peterhouse Partbooks. Based on Sandon's reconstructions, the Boston-based early music ensemble Blue Heron is about to release its fifth of a planned five-CD series of music from the Henrician set of the Peterhouse partbooks, including compositions by Hugh Aston, Robert Jones, John Mason, Nicholas Ludford, Richard Pygott, and Robert Hunt. Additionally, the Seattle-based Byrd Ensemble released the album Our Lady: Music from the Peterhouse Partbooks, also based on Sandon's reconstructions, in 2011.

Typically, the device is an implanted blood pump such as a Left ventricular assist device. The malfunction is a blockage in the flow of blood anywhere along a vessel (upstream or downstream) and it is mainly due to the bio- incompatible presence of a fairly complex mechanical apparatus. Pump thrombus is dreaded complication of CF LVAD technology http://aats.org/annualmeeting/Program- Books/2014/presentations/77/AATSThrombus.pdf that can require repeat surgery to replace the pump or lead to death.https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm457327.htm In suspected pump thrombus, the clinical patient condition or pump parameters suggest thrombus on any of the blood-contacting surfaces of the pump (inflow cannula, pump itself, or outflow graft). Confirmed pump thrombus is done by visual inspection (during device exchange, transplantation, autopsy), irrefutable radiographic evidence, or absence of Doppler inflow or outflow signals. Introduction Not all ventricular assist devices (VADs) are fully biocompatible, thus device thrombosis has always been a significant complication. Older generation pulsatile VADs were relatively large and it was practically impossible to thrombose the entire pump and cause hemodynamic consequences. Instead, any thrombus created in the pump could be dislodged, possibly resulting in an embolic stroke. In contrast, the newer continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF LVAD) are much smaller and have smaller gaps between the various components of the pump. These characteristics predispose CF LVAD to thrombosis of the entire pump where the clot stays in the device, leading to increased hemolysis and device dysfunction. Thrombosis of CF LVADSs can occur as a result of various factors, which can be divided into three categories: the pump, the patient, and the clinician. Management protocols for VADs are usually institution-dependent and there is a large variability in clinician-related factors. A decrease in anticoagulation thresholds Slater JP, Rose EA, Levin HR, et al. Low thromboembolic risk without anticoagulation using advanced-design left ventricular assist devices. Ann Thorac Surg 1996;62:1321-7; discussion 1328. has been postulated to have resulted in an increase in CF LVAD thrombosis. A complex balance exists between over-anticoagulation and under-anticoagulation, in a patient population where the coagulation system response to the CF LVAD device varies greatly between individuals. Common adverse events precipitated by over- anticoagulation include bleeding problems such as gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage, while common complications due to under- anticoagulation include hemolysis, pump thrombosis and ischemic/embolic strokes. Unfortunately, robust and individually-tailored anticoagulation therapy protocols do not exist in most institutions, which usually utilize a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù approach. One anticoagulation protocol example targets the therapeutic window of coumadin of an International Normalized Ratio (INR) goal of 2-3 and full-dose aspirin for antiplatelet activity. In the complex dynamics of the interaction of patients‚Äô systems, there is no completely safe zone between thrombosis or bleeding, or both. Definition Pump thrombosis is defined as a specific case of a major device malfunction. In turn, device malfunction is as defined by Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as a failure of one or more of the components of the mechanical circulatory support systems which either directly causes or could potentially induce a state of inadequate circulatory support (low cardiac output state) or death. A failure that was iatrogenic or recipient- induced will be classified as an Iatrogenic/Recipient-Induced failure. Device failure should be classified according to which component fails as follows: 1\\\\. Pump failure (blood containing components of pump and any motor or other pump actuating mechanism that is housed with the blood contacting components). In the special situation of pump thrombosis, thrombus is documented to be present within the device or its conduits that result in or could potentially induce circulatory failure. 2\\\\. Non-pump failure (e.g., external pneumatic device unit, electric power supply unit, batteries, controller, interconnect cable, compliance chamber).http://aats.org/annualmeeting/Program- Books/2014/presentations/77/AATSThrombus.pdf Problems The FDA is aware of serious adverse events associated with LVADs. It has received reports and information from a variety of sources indicating an increase in the rate of pump thrombosis events in patients implanted with LVADs. Information also shows that patients are experiencing pump thrombosis events earlier than observed during the clinical trials conducted to support product approvals in 2008 Bridge To Transplant (BTT) and 2010 Destination Therapy (DT). Two analyses in scientific literature reported the confirmed (after explant) pump thrombosis rate as high as 8.4% of implanted devices at 3 months (Starling et al, 2013) and 6% of implanted devices at 6 months (Kirklin et al, 2014). This is compared to 1.6% of implanted devices at one year during the BTT clinical trial and 3.8% of implanted devices at 2 years during the DT clinical trial.https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm457327.htm Cause The cause for PT are classified as either pump-related, patient- related, or management-related. But of particular concern is the emergence in some reports of HIT syndrome as an etiologic factor in some cases of PT. =Pump related= Inherent to the technology itself. Examples: Heat generated by pump rotor; Outflow graft kink. =Patient Related= Individual conditions that render patient more likely to have thrombotic complications. Examples: Atrial fibrillation; Infection. =Management Related= 1\\\\. Implantation technique. Example: Inflow cannula malposition. 2\\\\. Inadequate anticoagulation. Examples: No heparin bridging; subtherapeutic INR. 3\\\\. Low pump flow due to low speed setting to manage AI, GIB or assess/induce recovery. Diagnosis Criteria should include the presence of hemolysis, presence of heart failure not explained by structural disease, and/or abnormal pump parameters. Imaging and functional studies (ramp) can confirm diagnosis.Management of Pump Thrombosis in Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Devices John M. Stulak; Shashank Sharma; Simon Maltais. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Management No standardized protocol exist regarding the management of LVAD pump thrombosis.http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/842847_2 No standardized protocol exist regarding therapy of pump thrombosis.http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/842847_3 Prevention The complication itself, its prevention, or its treatment may lead to PT. Prevention of GI bleeding in VAD patients often includes keeping pump speeds lower to potentially minimize the proliferation of AV malformations. In addition, bleeding, once it occurs, is managed at least temporarily by a halting or decrease in AC. Efforts to decrease the development of AI in LVAD patients include keeping pump speeds on the lower side as well. Right ventricular dysfunction, particularly in the early postoperative period, is likewise managed with lower pump speeds. Finally, infections and sepsis are known to be associated with a more hypercoagulable state in VAD patients. In the end, the occurrence of any of these complications may thus prove to be a surrogate for a higher risk of PT. While the issue of biocompatibility is always be at the forefront of critical issues of new pumps, the field of mechanical circulatory support is first focusing on adopting a standardized approach to this therapy so that valid analyses and comparisons can be made. History Beginning in 2011, centers and collaborative groups began to observe a significant increase in the incidence of pump thrombosis, which led to pump modifications and the appreciation of more strict control of blood pressure and anticoagulation with this pump design.Management of Pump Thrombosis in Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Devices John M. Stulak; Shashank Sharma; Simon Maltais. The unexpected abrupt increase in LVAD thrombosis was accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels with outcomes of different management strategies in a multi-institutional study.,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mhheartware-device- idUSTRE73F2CV20110416https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research- and-journals/are-blood-clots-in-patients-with-heart-assist-pumps-decreasing- or-on-the-rise-in-2015 Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase during the first month offers an opportunity for early intervention strategies.http://www.jhltonline.org/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/healun/3.10.1016j.healun.2015.10.024.pdf Starting in approximately March 2011, the occurrence of confirmed pump thrombosis at 3 months after implantation increased from 2.2% to 8.4% by January 1, 2013. Before March 1, 2011, the median time from implantation to thrombosis was 18.6 months, and from March 2011 onward, it was 2.7 months. The occurrence of elevated LDH levels within 3 months after implantation mirrored that of thrombosis. Thrombosis was presaged by LDH levels that more than doubled, from 540 IU per liter to 1490 IU per liter, within the weeks before diagnosis. While starting in 2011 device failures due to clots forming inside the pumps appeared to rise dramatically, there is some indication that these failures may now be declining, but data analysis and interpretation are complex.http://www.jhltonline.org/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/healun/JHLT_Dec15_Pump_Thrombosis_FINAL.pdf Research Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an invaluable tool in the development of VADs, enabling new designs to be tested rapidly and undesirable flow characteristics eliminated in successive versions before prototypes are manufactured. CFD is used for predicting pressure-flow characteristics and efficiency curves, revealing the detailed flow field to help eliminate regions of recirculation or stagnation and for calculating fluid dynamic forces. When combined with models of blood damage CFD has been used for predicting haemolysis and platelet activation by VADs. When combined with shape optimization algorithms it can be used in design optimization.

Early life Rufus Everson Brown was born in Dickinson, New York on December 3, 1854. He attended academies in Lawrenceville and Amsterdam before relocating to Burlington, Vermont to study law. Legal career Brown studied at the firm of Wales and Taft, which included Russell S. Taft, a prominent politician and judge. He attained admission to the bar in 1880, and operated a farm while beginning a law practice. In 1891 he opened an office in Burlington and began to practice law full-time. In 1897 he started Brown & Macomber in partnership with James H. Macomber. In 1903 he formed a new partnership with Russell W. Taft, the son of Russell S. Taft. Political career A Republican, Brown served as Burlington's grand juror (city prosecutor) from 1892 to 1894. From 1894 to 1900 he served as state's attorney for Chittenden County. From 1901 to 1903 Brown was a member of the Vermont State Senate. In 1903 he was appointed Burlington's city attorney. In 1912, Brown defeated Frank C. Archibald in the Republican primary for Vermont Attorney General. He won the general election, and served from 1912 to 1914. His term expired in November 1914; under a new statute, terms for statewide office holders were scheduled to begin in January starting in 1915. To bridge the gap between the end of Brown's term in November 1914 and the start of Herbert G. Barber's in January 1915, Governor Allen M.

In her work she explores the social and topographical changes of her environment, observes their inherent complexities and understands how resources such as soil and earth, and their potential values, are subject to regional and cultural analysis. Her work has been featured in many institutions including the Tate Modern the KW Institute (Berlin), the Stedelijk Museum and the biennale of Sharjah. She also took part in the 20th Biennale of Sydney.  Life  Otobong Nkanga was born in Kano, Nigeria, in 1974. Her first personal exhibition, CLASSICISM & BEYOND, took place in 2002 in the non-profit organization, Project Row Houses in Houston. In 2007 to 2008, in response to the work Baggage (1972 ‚Äì 2007/2008) by American artist Allan Kaprow, Nkanga has designed a performance for the Kunsthalle Bern. The initial work that was based on issues of movement of goods from one point of the planet to another, Naylor introduces a post-colonial dimension. As evidenced the artist in an interview, the concepts of identity, cultural specificities are again at the centre of his artistic gesture of re-appropriation. Also, in 2008, the project Contained measures of Land used soil both as a symbol of the territory and competition and conflict. A year later, during his residence at Pointe-Noire, in the Congo, it has collected eight different colours of Earth. Pointe-Noire was colonized by the Portuguese and the French. Art critic Philippe Pirotte wrote that Nkanga comes to create a kind of vehicle for the presentation and the transportation which does not define the use value in an era where everyone is obsessed with the transformation of natural tools resources which serve humanity. Her project, Contained Measures of Tangible Memories that started in 2010, from her first trip to the Morocco, she explores the practices of dyeing. She essentially transform objects in circulation to objets d'art. In 2012, she has created a device for a performance, or rather an installation entitled Contained Measures of Kolanut with two photos, one of a tree called adekola and one with two girls imitating trees. Nkanga explained that the Kola tree is important for its culture and is a symbol of spirituality to its culture. After she suggested eating a brown nut (Cola acuminata) or a cream (Cola nitida). These elements existed for preparing a conversation. This type of performance can last for hours and requires a lot of concentration. The same year, she proposed a performance for the Tate programme \\"Politics of Representation\\" in which she invited visitors to explore the concepts of identity, perception, and memory.

He originally worked in the Romantic and Academic styles, but later became an Impressionist.  Biography  He began his artistic studies at the Royal Academy of Art with Salomon Verveer, who taught in the Romantic tradition.Profile @ the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie. His early works were mostly landscapes in the style of the Hague School. His first solo exhibition was in 1861 in Rotterdam. The Beach at Scheveningen.In 1865, attracted by new trends in art, he went to Paris and enrolled at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, where he studied with Jean- L√©on G√©r√¥me and switched to a more Academic style. For a time, he specialized in French genre scenes set in the 18th century, featuring elegant ladies with courteous men. In 1870, he held his first exhibition at the Salon and won a medal there in 1874.Biographical notes @ Rau Antiques. He established a studio in Paris and became a client of Goupil & Cie, but frequently returned to The Hague with friends and would stay at a seaside hotel in Scheveningen. It was during these stays that he began his transition to Impressionism; inspired by the effects of sunlight on the water and the fleeting changes of light and shadow on the sand. His work in this style proved to be successful, both in France and the Netherlands and he was awarded a silver medal at the Exposition Universelle (1889). After 1891, he worked as an illustrator for Elsevier; contributing to their Neerland's Pen en Stift series (\\"Dutch literature illustrated by Dutch artists\\"). His first drawings appeared in Eene Illuzie, a collection of stories by Louis Couperus. He apparently committed suicide at his studio in Paris.

As a two-year-old in 1984 he showed great promise by winning three of his four races including the William Hill Futurity. In the following year he was overshadowed by his stable companions Slip Anchor and Oh So Sharp but recorded further victories in the Predominate Stakes and the King Edward VII Stakes. He contested all three legs of the British Triple Crown, finishing seventh in the 2000 Guineas, fifth in The Derby and third in the St Leger. He was retired from racing after sustaining the last of a series of injuries after winning five of his ten races. He stood as a breeding stallion in New Zealand but had little success. Background Lanfranco was a chestnut horse with a broad white blaze and a long white sock on his left hind leg. He was sired by Relko, the French-trained winner of the 1963 Epsom Derby. Relko was not a conspicuous success as a sire of winners, although several of his daughters made an impact as broodmares. Lanfranco's dam Cama was an undistinguished racehorse, winning one minor race as a two-year-old in 1972. She was a distant female-line descendant of the outstanding racemare Wheel of Fortune. As a yearling, Lanfranco was consigned to the Newmarket Highflyer Sale and bought for 17,500 guineas. He entered the ownership of Charles St George and was sent into training with Henry Cecil at the Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1984: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Lanfranco contested a maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse in June and finished second of the twelve runners, beaten half a length by the Guy Harwood-trained St Hilarion. In another maiden at Yarmouth Racecourse in July he recorded his first success, winning very easily from six opponents at odds of 1/4. In the Exeter Stakes at Newmarket in August he faced only two opponents and led for most of the way to defeat Kohaylan by two and a half lengths. The runner-up subsequently franked the form by winning the Acomb Stakes at York later that month Lanfranco sustained a minor injury in the Exeter Stakes (Cecil described him as having been \\"jarred up\\" on the firm ground) and he missed the Royal Lodge Stakes which had been his intended target. After a break of over two months, Lanfranco was moved up in class for the Group One William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Lester Piggott he was made the 100/30 third favourite behind the French-trained River Drummer (runner-up in the Grand Crit√©rium) and the Harwood-trained Sabona, whilst the other eight runners included Damister and Highfire (first and second in the Somerville Tattersall Stakes) as well Brave Bambino (third in the Seaton Delaval Stakes) and Northern River, who had beaten Sabona at Newbury. Piggott settled the colt in second place behind the outsider Great Reef before sending him to the front approaching the last quarter mile. Lanfranco accelerated into a two length lead and then stayed on in the closing stages to win by three quarters of a length and one and a half lengths from Damister and Brave Bambino with River Drummer in fourth place. =1985: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Lanfranco started 10/1 third favourite for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 4 May but looked completely outpaced and finished seventh of the fourteen runners behind Shadeed. Later that month he was moved up to one and a half miles for the Predominate Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. He started favourite and won easily by three lengths from Phardante. In the 206th running of the Epsom Derby on 5 June Lanfranco started at odds of 14/1 in a fourteen-runner field: Henry Cecil had doubts about running the colt as he felt that the prevailing firm ground would be to his disadvantage. With Steve Cauthen riding the Cecil stable's main hope Slip Anchor, and Piggott opting to ride the Irish-trained Theatrical Lanfranco was ridden by the American jockey Cash Asmussen. On a course which, according to Cecil, did not suit the colt, he finished fifth behind Slip Anchor, Law Society, Damister and Supreme Leader. Timeform opined that should have been aimed instead at the Prix du Jockey Club in which Mouktar was \\"the only top-class horse\\" engaged. Two weeks after his run at Epsom, Lanfranco started the 13/8 favourite for the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Cauthen, he recorded an easy win, beating Mango Express by four lengths, with another four lengths back to Infantry in third place. After his connections opted to bypass the Irish Derby, Lanfranco was matched against older horses for the first and only time in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket on 9 July. He started the 4/6 favourite but finished third behind Petoski and Crazy with Jupiter Island in fourth. The winner went on to take the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes eighteen days later. As in his previous season, the experience of racing on firm ground resulted in injury, with Lanfranco suffering a \\"jarred shoulder\\" which kept him off the course for two months. On his final appearance Lanfranco contested the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster on 14 September. He started the 85/40 second favourite behind his stable companion Oh So Sharp, a filly who was bidding for a Triple Crown after winning the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks Stakes. Ridden by Piggott he led for most way without being able to break away from his five opponents, before being overtaken by Oh So Sharp three furlongs from the finish. He stayed on well in the last quarter mile without ever looking to regain his advantage and finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and a head by Oh So Sharp and Phardante. Assessment In the official International Classification of European two- year-olds for 1984, Lanfranco was rated on 75, nine pounds behind the top- rated Kala Dancer, and four behind River Drummer whom he had defeated decisively at Doncaster. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 123, six pounds inferior to Kala Dancer, who was rated their best two-year-old. In 1985 he was again rated 123 by Timeform, thirteen pounds behind their top-rated three-year-old Slip Anchor. In the International Classification he was rated fifteen pounds inferior to Slip Anchor, who was the highest-rated three year-old of the year. Stud record At the end of his racing career Lanfranco was exported to stand as a breeding stallion in New Zealand before returning to Europe. He had little impact as a sire of the winners with the best of his offspring being the steeplechaser Leading Bounty. His last foals were born in 1993.

She was one of the few English women concert organists in the late nineteenth century. Life Born into a musical family in London in 1867, her great-uncle William Edroff had been musical director of the Royal Grecian Theatre. She was taught primarily by Frederick Scotson Clark, founder of the London Organ School. She first came to the attention of the press in 1883 when assisting him at a concert at the Fisheries Exhibition in London. In 1884 she took part in student recitals and after performing Bach's Toccata and Fugue in G Minor received the most attention in the press. Between 1887 and 1895 she gave over two dozen publicized recitals at the London Organ school and elsewhere, first as an organ student and later as organ Professor for the school. In June 1895 she gave two concerts in the St George's Hall in Liverpool causing quite a sensation. The Musical standard newspaper noted \\"Miss Edroff is an exceedingly clever player, and rather astonished those who had gone out of curiosity and to scoff\\". Her recital repertoire was extensive, encompassing composers from Bach to Widor. In addition to her work as a concert organist from 1893 to at least 1900 she worked as Professor of Organ at the London Organ School, where she taught both male and female organ students. In 1909 she became an Associate of the Royal College of Music (ARCM). She was a friend of Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji's mother and helped him in his studies. In 1953, Emily was one of the twenty- three signatories of a letter presented to the composer to encourage him to record some of his works.

Discovery and naming  Ilium In 1959, Fran√ßois Ellenberger, Paul Ellenberger, Jean Fabre and Leonard Ginsburg discovered the type specimen, a thighbone or femur and other assorted bones, south of the village of Thabana Morena. In 1962 these were addressed in a thesis by D. Costedoat.Costedoat D., 1962, Etude de quelques reptiles fossiles, thesis, University of Paris The exact location the bones were recovered, is today unknown. In 1993, Fran√ßois-Xavier Gauffre assigned the remains to a second species of Melanorosaurus: Melanorosaurus thabanensis. The description was provisional, and in 1997 the fossil was described in more detail in a publication by Jacques van Heerden and Peter Malcolm Galton. The specific name refers to the site Thabana-Morena in Lesotho. Gauffre assumed that the specimen had been found in the Upper Elliot Formation dating from the Hettangian-Sinemurian and thus was about twenty million year younger than Melanorosaurus readi. In 1996, he revised the date to the Lower Elliot Formation of the late Triassic in his non-published dissertation. He also referred the thighbone to a new genus and species Thotobolosaurus. This remained a non-valid nomen ex dissertatione, as the name would never be published; furthermore the type material of this species does not coincide with that of M. thabanensis.Gauffre F-X., 1996, Phylog√©nie des dinosaures prosauropodes et √©tude d‚Äôun prosauropode du Trias sup√©rieur d‚ÄôAfrique australe Dissertation, Mus√©um National d‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle In 2016, M. thabanensis was appointed to the separate genus Meroktenos by Claire Peyre de Fabr√®gues and Ronan Allain. The genus name is a combination of ancient Greek ŒºŒ∑œÅœåœÇ, meros (\\"thigh\\") and Œ∫œÑ·øÜŒΩŒøœÇ, kt√®nos (\\"beast\\"). The combinatio nova thus becomes Meroktenos thabanensis, the type species is the original Melanorosaurus thabanensis. The holotype, MNHN.F.LES 16, consists of a right thighbone (MNHN.F.LES16c), a portion of the right ilium, with a piece of a vertebral neural arch (MNHN.F.LES16a); a left pubic bone (MNHN.F.LES16b); and a second right metatarsal (MNHN.F.LES16d) associated with the skeleton. In 2016, a new specimen, MNHN.F.LES351, was referred to the species; consisting of a cervical vertebra, a left ulna and a, probably left, radius. It might have belonged to the same individual as the holotype, but this cannot be strictly proven.  Description  Caudal vertebra Meroktenos has a femur length of around forty- eight centimeters, suggesting a body length of about four meters. In 2016, a revised list of distinguishing traits was given. The blade height of the ilium, measured from the highest point of the antitrochanter to the upper edge of the blade is 60% of the total height of the ilium, including peduncles. The rear blade of the ilium is roughly triangular in side view. The femur is very compact with a robusticity index, length divided by the circumference of the shaft, of 2.09. The femur has a straight shaft in both side and front views. The femoral shaft is substantially wider transversely than it is wide in side view, with a ratio of 1.58. On the rear of the femoral shaft, the fourth trochanter is oriented obliquely, running from the upper and inner side to the lower and outer side. Phylogeny  Ulna and radius bones of the lower arm In 2016, Meroktenos was placed in the Sauropodomorpha, in a basal position. According to a cladistic analysis, Meroktenos formed a polytomy with Blikanasaurus and more derived species, above Aardonyx in the evolutionary tree and below a polytomy including Melanorosaurus and Antetonitrus. Palaeobiology The relative transverse width of the femur, the eccentricity, is remarkably high for such a small animal. These proportions were known previously only from Sauropoda and explained as an adaptation to a very high absolute weight. Because the holotype probably was not a young animal and is unlikely to have attained giant proportions, the trait must have had a different function.

The statue was designed and constructed in Pyongyang, North Korea by the Mansudae Overseas Projects, an arm of the Mansudae Art Studio. It stands and weighs 4.8 tons. The statue sits on a marble slab high at the head of Samora Machel Avenue, and is illuminated at night. The statue has been criticized for bearing little resemblance to Samora.

The album was produced by frontman Max Bloom over a period of several months in 2015 in his parents' house in London. The album's release was preceded by three singles: \\"Hold Me Closer\\"; \\"Hearts in Motion\\"; and \\"Cannonball\\". Background and recording In April 2013, original lead singer and guitarist Daniel Blumberg left the band. Guitarist Max Bloom subsequently took over duties as frontman and the band was joined by guitarist Ed Hayes as an official member that August. Yuck released its sophomore studio album Glow & Behold on Fat Possum Records on 30 September 2013 to mixed reviews. After touring in support of Glow & Behold, the band self-released the Southern Skies EP in April 2014. Yuck signed with indie label Mam√© Records in 2015 and released the single \\"Hold Me Closer\\" on 8 July via SoundCloud the same year. On 12 January 2016, Yuck announced the album title as Stranger Things and release date of 26 February. The same day, Yuck revealed the album artwork, released the second single, \\"Hearts in Motion\\", and announced a North American spring tour. In an accompanying press release, Bloom stated: \\"[The band] basically spent no money on the record and it was a really relaxed way of doing things[.]\\" The album was recorded in London primarily in Bloom's parents' house where Yuck had previously recorded its 2011 self-titled debut album. The band recorded the drum tracks at a nearby rehearsal studio. The band posted a video announcing pre-orders for the album on its official YouTube channel three days later. On 2 February 2016, \\"Cannonball\\" was released as the third single from the album. Composition Stranger Things is a departure from the softer, shoegaze-esque sound of the Southern Skies EP. The album was inspired by \\"UK postpunk\\" and 90's alternative rock bands such as Dinosaur Jr. and Built to Spill. Max Bloom described the songs \\"Swirling\\", \\"Like a Moth\\", and \\"I'm OK\\" as \\"remarkably gentle\\" and referred to the latter as \\"a very personal song because it's just about the anxiety I've been feeling over the last couple of years[.]\\" Bassist Mariko Doi performs lead vocals on the song \\"As I Walk Away\\", which, according to Bloom, was \\"quite influenced\\" by her solo work.Wiseman, Stewart (22 January 2016). \\"Interview with Max Bloom from Yuck.\\" Northern Transmissions. Retrieved 6 February 2016 Chris DeVille from Stereogum favorably compared \\"Hearts in Motion\\" to Transmissions from the Satellite Heart-era Flaming Lips, while Tom Breihan from the same website described \\"Cannonball\\" as \\"a blazing, amped-up blast of fuzz-guitar tunefulness[.]\\" Writing for the webzine Overblown, Jamie Coughlan referred to the lead single \\"Hold Me Closer\\" as \\"euphoric\\". Release and promotion On 17 February 2016, about a week before the album's official release, Stranger Things became available for streaming via NPR. The previous day, Yuck uploaded a live performance of \\"Hearts in Motion\\", with James Thomas from Parakeet (Mariko Doi's side-project) temporarily filling in for Jonny Rogoff on drums. The band announced spring tour dates in the United Kingdom in support of the album and uploaded a short promotional comedic video on YouTube of the band member's fathers recommending purchasing the album. Critical reception Stranger Things has received mixed to positive reviews. On Metacritic, the album has a normalized score of 62 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". El Hunt from DIY gave Stranger Things four out of five stars, writing \\"Yuck craft their most immediate, and inescapable record to date[.]\\" Jesse Nee-Vogelman from Slant gave the album a negative review, calling the album \\"often little more than a poor imitation of [Yuck's] earlier sound.\\" In a mixed review for Exclaim!, Pierre John Felcenloben cited an \\"overemphasis on influences\\" that made the record \\"more recognizably likeable than imaginative.\\" Track listing Personnel ;Yuck *Max Bloom - lead vocals, guitar *Mariko Doi - bass, backing vocals, lead vocals on \\"As I Walk Away\\" *Ed Hayes - guitar *Jonny Rogoff - drums References Category:2016 albums Category:Yuck (band) albums ","title":"Stranger Things (Yuck album)"},{"id":"49335751","text":"Radostina Rangelova-Chitigoi (Bulgarian: –†–∞–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –†–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞ - –¶–∏—Ç–∏–≥–æ–π) (born ) is a Bulgarian female former volleyball player, playing as an outside- spiker.

Formed in 1942, the corps fought in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, East Pomeranian Offensive and Berlin Offensive. The corps was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its actions during the storming of Berlin. It was disbanded in Germany in June 1946.  History  The corps was first formed on the Northwestern Front in December 1942, on the basis of the 384th Rifle Division. It was commanded by Major General Nikanor Zakhvatayev. In May 1944, Zakhvatayev was transferred to command the 1st Shock Army. He was replaced by Major General Mikhail Siyazov. On 29 July, Siyazov became 67th Army deputy commander and was replaced by Major General Stepan Bunkov. On November 3, 1944 the corps included the 23rd Guards, 52nd Guards and 33rd Rifle Divisions as part of the 3rd Shock Army. It was the main force moving forward to the railway line Auce ‚Äì Layzhuva. On 2 December, the corps was part of Stavka Reserve and received orders to concentrate south of Jelgava for loading onto troop transports at the Jelgava, Platone, Meitene and Joni≈°kis. At the beginning of January 1945, trains carrying elements of the corps arrived at Mrozy, 50 kilometers east of Warsaw. The corps was concentrated 25 kilometers east of Warsaw, in the area of Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki, Ka≈Çuszyn, Liw and Dobre. On 14 January, the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive was launched. The corps was part of the army reserve in the early days of the offensive. On 19 January, the corps moved to bypass Warsaw from the north. On the morning of 20 January, the corps was in the area of Sochaczew, Lovach and Skierniewice. By the end of 25 January, it was in the area of Izbica, Kolo and Klodawa. By the end of January, the corps had reached Bromberg. The 33rd and 52nd Guards Rifle Divisions positioned themselves at Bushkovo, Tsempelburg and Kline-Visnevka. The 23rd Guards Rifle Division was stationed in the second echelon. The 32nd and 15th SS Infantry Divisions made several attacks against the corps, supported by tanks. These attacks were repulsed. Bunkov was sent to study at the Military Academy of the General Staff on 12 February and replaced by Lieutenant General Alexander Kazankin. The 23rd and 52nd Guards Rifle Divisions took up defensive positions on the east bank of the Oder between Nieder-Krenina and Alt-Rudnitz. From 16 April, the corps was involved in the Battle of Berlin. Kazankin was wounded on 27 April during the fighting for Berlin. He was replaced by 3rd Shock Army deputy commander Major General Alexander Filatov. On the morning of 2 May, the German troops began to surrender and the fighting ended soon after. On 11 June, the corps was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its actions at Berlin. The corps appears to have been disbanded in June 1946, still part of the 3rd Shock Army.Feskov et al 2013, p. 397  References  *  External links  *Corps commander list at samsv.narod.ru G12 Category:Military units and formations established in 1942 Category:1942 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1946 Category:Military units and formations awarded the Order of the Red Banner ","title":"12th Guards Rifle Corps"},{"id":"49335771","text":"William Doolin was an assemblyman.

Bing Crosby Entertains was Crosby‚Äôs most important radio series to date and it enabled him to fully develop as a rounded radio personality instead of a singer who did not speak. Background Bing Crosby‚Äôs radio career had taken off with his nightly nation-wide broadcasts from New York in 1931-32 and he moved on to the two nights a week Music That Satisfies show which ran for 13 weeks early in 1933. The nightly shows required him to do separate shows for the East Coast and for the West Coast because of the time difference. That was avoided for the Music That Satisfies series as Crosby broadcast at 9:15 p.m. Eastern which meant that it was heard at 6:15 p.m. in California. By this time, Crosby was making three films a year and undertaking stage appearances. A once-a-week radio show which did not have to be repeated for the West Coast was ideal for him and Woodbury Soap agreed to sponsor such a show on the CBS network. Season 1 The show made its bow on Monday, October 16, 1933, at 5:30 p.m. Pacific Time. Musical support came from Lennie Hayton‚Äôs orchestra and Ken Niles was the announcer. The guest was eighteen-year-old songstress, Mary Lou Raymond. Bing was paid $1,750 per broadcast for a minimum of 13 weeks plus a figure to be agreed for a further six broadcasts. The shows opened with Ken Niles saying: ‚ÄúBing Crosby entertains‚Äù followed by a word of welcome from Crosby and an opening song. ‚ÄúAfter that Niles would deliver a message from Woodbury whose slogan: ‚ÄúFor the skin you love to touch,‚Äù represented considerable aesthetic improvement for Crosby over coughless cigarettes and saliva-free cigars.‚Äù The Woodbury program is significant for it gave Crosby some dialogue for the first time, his personality emerging in light banter with Niles and introductions to his songs. It also began the system of cross-promoting his own work as he featured songs and guest stars from his own films and sang songs he had recorded. Billboard liked the opening show saying, inter alia: ‚ÄúSelling a product to the women must of necessity use a program of definite appeal to them and in Crosby, Woodbury Soap has chosen wisely. For Bing is in the middle of a brilliant career and the motion picture successes in which he appears add to his strength as a radio draw. Further, he has not been heard too often of late and his performance is better than ever as to both voice and choice of selections.‚Äù There was a dispute between Crosby and the sponsor over what theme tune should be used. Woodbury Soap and its agency, Lennon & Mitchell, considered that the tune ‚ÄòLoveliness‚Äô which had always been the theme of the Woodbury programs should continue. Crosby argued that the logical theme for the stanza was \\"Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)\\", on the grounds that the song had been identified with him ever since he had been on the air. Eventually Woodbury conceded to the singer. Other problems arose with Dale Winbrow, who had been sent out to the West coast from New York by the Lennon & Mitchell agency to resolve the theme tune argument and supervise the show. Winbrow listened to the program that Crosby and Lennie Hayton had prepared for the next broadcast and was very critical of it. ‚ÄúThe flare up that was provoked from Crosby wound up with the warbler and Hayton declaring themselves out of the show. The baritone‚Äôs management later prevailed upon him to hold on while the situation was being straightened out with the agency on the New York end.‚Äù Major guest stars during the series were the Mills Brothers (15 appearances) and Kay Thompson & the Three Rhythm Kings (10 times). Carole Lombard guested on the show on April 2, 1934 to promote the Crosby-Lombard film We're Not Dressing. The show had a 25.1 rating for the season putting it in 14th. position for evening programs. The highest rated evening program as assessed by the Co-operative Analysis of Broadcasting for the 1933-34 season was the Eddie Cantor show (with a Crossley rating of 50.2) with Rudy Vall√©e coming in at 39.0. After the January 8, 1934 show, Lennie Hayton handed over the orchestral support for a few weeks to Gus Arnheim and his Orchestra. In turn, Carol Lofner's Beverly Wilshire Orchestra took over from Arnheim after the February 26 show and then Jimmy Grier assumed the role on March 26 until the end of the season. In March 1934, Crosby agreed a further seven weeks‚Äô contract with Woodbury at $2,500 per broadcast. He had been offered $3,000 by Studebaker but this was for a minimum of 13 weeks which did not suit the singer as he wanted to be free for a tour of personal appearances immediately on the expiration of his Paramount Pictures contract at the end of May 1934. It had been Studebaker's intention to step into the Monday night niche held by Woodbury on CBS and if Crosby had not renewed, Woodbury would have ended the show's run with the April 9 broadcast. No guest stars appeared after the April 9 broadcast. The final show of the season was on May 28, 1934. Season 2 The Woodbury show returned to the air on CBS on September 18, 1934 at 5 p.m. Pacific Time. Now on Tuesdays, this time Crosby was paid $6,000 a week to deliver a complete package. He paid for the guests, the orchestra and the arrangements and retained what was left for himself. Georgie Stoll led the orchestra as Jimmy Grier had been signed exclusively by another program. The Boswell Sisters were guests on the opening show having been signed on a thirteen-week contract. Claude Binyon wrote the scripts and Ken Niles continued as the announcer. Crosby promoted his hit record of Love in Bloom on the opening program. The audience share during the season was 15.5. thumb Variety welcomed the opening show. ‚ÄúTwo types of delivery, both the finest in their line and a first rate orchestra to round it out. This one sounded sure-fire on paper and lives up to all expectations on the air. Crosby is Crosby and calls for no comment‚Ä¶The Boswells are more torrid than ever in their close harmony‚Ä¶.Woodbury here, has a Tuesday evening show that‚Äôs bound to be tuned in on.‚Äù Major guest stars during the series were the Boswell Sisters (13 appearances) and the Mills Brothers (12 times). Kitty Carlisle appeared on the November 27 show to help promote the film Here Is My Heart and Joan Bennett was on the February 12, 1935 program to advertise the Crosby-Bennett movie Mississippi. Ginger Rogers was another notable guest during the series. On the November 13 show and for the next six programs, after the opening theme, the orchestra launched into ‚ÄòBoola Boola‚Äô and the listener was transported to the ivy-covered walls of ‚ÄòWoodbury Prep‚Äô. Ken Niles was president of the student body and Bing, the venerable Dean. The Boswell Sisters were co-eds. It is worth explaining that ‚ÄòPrep‚Äô was not an abbreviation for ‚ÄòPreparatory‚Äô but ‚Äòis short for preparation and Woodbury‚Äôs is the finest preparation of its type on the market‚Äô. It is possible that the later ‚ÄòKraft Music Hall University‚Äô routine, attributed to Carroll Carroll, had its beginnings here. At the beginning of the November 20 show, Bing announced, in an extremely hoarse voice, that he would not be able to sing as a result of attending the football game between Santa Clara and St. Mary's of Moraga at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco at the weekend. It had rained throughout the game and Bing had done a lot of shouting in support and lost his voice. The Boswell Sisters and the Georgie Stoll orchestra had to carry the program. History was made on the December 25, 1934 show when Crosby sang ‚ÄúSilent Night‚Äù which was quite a departure for a popular singer then and Crosby was uneasy about singing it. The show's finale had a short play, set on a college campus. Crosby was supposed to be a professor bidding the students good-bye for the holidays. The singer was portrayed as having no home of his own to go to and he would have to face Christmas alone. After a brief sequence of events, during which Crosby cheered up another lonely soul, ‚ÄúSilent Night‚Äù is heard being sung outside his quarters as the students have come back to serenade him. Crosby opened the door and joined in, singing a solo as the show ended. Thousands of enthusiastic letters were received and ‚ÄúSilent Night‚Äù became part of Crosby's Christmas show for the next quarter of a century. The show's producer, Burt McMurtrie, recalled the occasion when speaking in 1979. ‚ÄúBing sang ‚ÄúSilent Night‚Äù there for the first time. All by himself. He sang it like nobody‚ÄîI mean, nobody, had ever sung it before. And all of us watching him stood stone still. It was unbelievable. So moving. Bing shouldn't have worried about it. Everything went off so beautifully, and even before we went off the air, the telephones started ringing.‚Äù However, the relationship between Crosby and the sponsor was under strain and on May 15, Variety announced, ‚ÄúWoodbury has not renewed with Bing Crosby for the fall. Primarily, standing in the way of a new contract is the refusal of the account to again allow the singer to have full control over the programme. Under the past season‚Äôs arrangement, Crosby picked his own supporting cast and numbers.‚Äù The last broadcast of the series took place on June 11, 1935 when the guest was Martha Tilton. Crosby was soon to leave CBS for NBC and the Kraft Music Hall.

CuSP is a low-cost 6U CubeSat nanosatellite that once deployed, will orbit the Sun, measuring incoming radiation that can create a wide variety of effects at Earth, from interfering with radio communications to tripping up satellite electronics to creating electric currents in power grids. The principal investigator for CuSP is Mihir Desai, at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. It will fly on the maiden flight of the Space Launch System, as a secondary payload of the Artemis 1 mission planned to launch in 2021. Objective To create a network of space weather stations would require many instruments scattered throughout space millions of miles apart, but the cost of such a system is prohibitive. Though the CubeSats can only carry a few instruments, they are relatively inexpensive to launch because of their small mass and standardized design. So, CuSP also serves as a test for creating a network of space science stations. Payload This CubeSat will carry three scientific instruments: #The Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (SIS), is built by the Southwest Research Institute to detect and characterize low- energy solar energetic particles. #Miniaturized Electron and Proton Telescope (MERiT), will return counts of high-energy solar energetic particles. #Vector Helium Magnetometer (VHM), being built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will measure the strength and direction of magnetic fields. ;Propulsion The satellite features a cold gas thruster system for propulsion, attitude control (orientation) and orbital maneuvering.CuSP Propulsion..

The caverns were created approximately 350 million years ago, during the Ordovician period and were carved out by water method. The caverns were formed by water seeping into the cracks of the rocks, gradually enlarging the cracks and dissolving the surrounding rocks. There is an underground river that flows through the caverns. Bull Shoals Caverns has been open since 1958. History * Human dwelling was first documented starting 300 B.C. via carbon dating. * The first Native Americans to use this cave were the Cliff Walkers which have been inhabiting caves for 10,000 years throughout Central North America as well as other tribes. * Early settlers in the late 1800s to early 1900s would use utilize the caverns as a well cooler aka (refrigerator). * During the American Civil War, Confederate soldiers use the cavern for harvesting saltpeter. * In the early to middle 1900s, moonshiners utilized the cavern as a hideout for their stills during Prohibition. Due to a lack of good roads, moonshiners were not bothered by ‚ÄúRevenuers‚Äù. During World War II, Bull Shoals Caverns was used for refrigeration by the surrounding neighbors for whiskey and food storage.
