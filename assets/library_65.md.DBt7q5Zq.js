Main Israeli controlled area to the west, the West Jerusalem pocket in the east. The Burma Road was established south of the pre-war road between the coastal and Jerusalem areas, thus bypassing the Jordanian controlled area around Latrun. Convoy returning to Tzrifin from Burma Road, 1948 Burma Road () (Derekh Burma) in Israel was a makeshift bypass road between Kibbutz Hulda and Jerusalem, built under the supervision of General Mickey Marcus during the 1948 Siege of Jerusalem. It was named for the Chinese Burma Road. History During the early phase of the 1948 Palestine war (from November 29, 1947 to May 15, 1948), local Arab forces took control of the hills overlooking the road to Jerusalem (Highway 1), between Sha'ar HaGai (Bab el-Wad) and Al-Qastal, in effect besieging the city's Jewish population. Vehicles attempting to use the road, Jerusalem's only link to the coast, took heavy fire. Convoys carrying food, weapons, and medical supplies sent by the Yishuv sustained heavy losses, and often did not get through to the city. On May 15, 1948, British forces withdrew from the Latrun monastery and police fort that dominated the road and prevented supplies from reaching Jerusalem. Latrun was immediately occupied by the Palmach's Harel Brigade. However, on the night of May 18, British- officered Arab Legion forces from Transjordan seized Latrun, and subsequent Jewish attempts to gain a foothold in the region failed. The growing need for supplies among Jerusalem's Jewish population weakened the Jewish foothold within the city considerably. A small amount of supplies, mostly munitions, were ferried by air, but the shortage of food, water, fuel and medicines was acute. The Jewish leadership, under David Ben-Gurion, feared that the city would surrender to the Arab Legion, and a search for a way to bypass the Arab blockade commenced. Construction  Construction of Burma Road A bulldozer tows a truck on Burma road, June 1948 A convoy on Burma Road, 1948 The road ran from just east of Dayr Muhaysin (today Moshav Beko'a), by way of Bayt Jiz and Bayt Susin (near kibbutz Harel), and then crossed the road that is now known as Highway 38. From there it ascended to Bayt Mahsir (Beit Meir), Saris (Shoresh and Sho'eva), and then connected with the old Jerusalem road. Several Israeli attempts to take the Arab Legion's position in Latrun failed, but surrounding parts of the road were cleared of snipers by the end of May. Jaques Bar saw that fire from the Latrun fort could be avoided by building another road screened from its Ordnance QF 25 pounder guns, allowing truck convoys to reach Jerusalem. When 150 troops moved on foot from Hulda to Harel Brigade headquarters near Abu Ghosh, that suggested that it would be possible to modify the \\"gazelle path\\" they followed, to be hidden from the Latrun fort and accommodate vehicular traffic. The major problem was a very steep section at the beginning of the ascent. After two weeks some supplies came through using mules and 200 men from the Home Guard (Mishmar Ha'am) to cover three miles which were impassable to vehicles. These men, mostly conscripts in their fifties, each carried a 45-pound load and made the trip twice a night. This effort lasted for five nights. On the night of May 30‚Äì31, an attempt failed when the lead jeep overturned. The road was improved slightly. A second attempt on the following night succeeded. On the night of June 1‚Äì2 the vehicles returned, and with them was a group from Jerusalem in three jeeps. The jeep party went on to Tel Aviv to organize a supply convoy for Jerusalem, which returned that night. However, the road was still practically impassable. Vehicles had to be pushed by hand through long sections. Porters and donkeys were used to bring supplies to Jerusalem while bulldozers and road workers moved critical parts of the road out of the line of sight of Jordanian artillery and widened it. The Arab Legion spotted the activity and Jordanian artillery shelled the road, but ineffectively, since it could not be seen. Arab sharpshooters killed several road workers, and an attack on June 9 left eight Israelis dead. Three weeks later, 10 June, the steepest section was opened to vehicles, though they needed assistance from tractors to get up it. The road allowed passage of a convoy without leaving the vehicles on June 10, in time for the UN-imposed cease fire, but it required repair as vehicular passage opened new pot holes. The road was finally completed on June 14, and water and fuel pipes were laid alongside it. Amos Horev, later President of Technion, was an Operations Officer, and was instrumental in creating the road. By the end of June the usual nightly convoy delivered 100 tons of supplies a night.Joseph, pages 155,156. Harry Levin, in his diary entry for 7 June, wrote that 12 tons a night were getting through and he estimated that the city needed 17 tons daily. On 28 July he noted that during the first truce, 11 June to 8 July, 8,000 truckloads arrived.Levin, pages 236, 273. This remained the sole supply route for several months, until the opening of the Valor Road (Kvish Hagevurah). In popular culture The 1966 film Cast a Giant Shadow, which dramatizes the career of Mickey Marcus, has a major part dedicated to the construction of the Burma Road. The 2006 film O Jerusalem includes scenes in which food and supplies are brought into Jerusalem on what would become the Burma Road.

He was born in England where he received his university training, but also studied in Germany and Ireland. He spent the remainder of his life in the United States. Biography Clarke was born in Harrow, England. His father was Joseph Thacher Clarke, an archaeologist. His older sister was the composer and violist Rebecca Clarke. Hans Clarke attended University College London School, and went on to enter the University as a student of chemistry, where he studied under William Ramsay, J. Norman Collie, and Samuel Smiles. He received a degree (Bachelor of Science) in 1908, and continued performing research at the University directed by Smiles and Stewart. In 1911 he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship, which allowed him to study for three semesters in Berlin under Emil Fischer, and one semester with A. W. Stewart at Queen's College, Belfast. On his return he was granted the D.Sc. from London University in 1913. Career Clarke's father had been the European representative of US photographic pioneer company Kodak for several years, and was a personal friend of founder George Eastman. After Hans graduated in Chemistry, Eastman consulted with him a few times regarding chemistry-related processes. When World War I erupted, Eastman was forced to look for other sources of the chemicals that he had been obtaining from Germany, and he turned to Hans Clarke for assistance. At Eastman's request, Clarke moved to Rochester, New York in 1914 to assist what he assumed to be the company's considerable chemical engineering department. He was shocked to discover that he was the sole organic chemist there. Clarke stayed with Kodak until 1928, when he was invited to become the Professor of Biological Chemistry in the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.Clarke's appointment to the Chair of the Biochemistry Department at Columbia (1928) \\"signaled a disciplinary shift away from a clinical orientation toward a biochemistry firmly rooted in organic and physical chemistry. In urging him to assume the chairmanship, James Conant wrote to Clarke, \\"Here is a Medical Group that at last have seen the light and want a straight organic chemist to run the show\\" (May 23, 1928). Clarke's background in academic and industrial organic chemistry had had little connection to medical problems; . . . Clarke specialized in the synthesis of proteins.\\" (from the summary of Clarke's papers at the American Philosophical Society website, accessed 27 June 2012) His administrative skills and ability to recognize talent contributed to the growth of Columbia's biochemistry department, which by the 1940s had become one of the largest and most influential in the United States.\\"During these years Clarke acquired a reputation among organic chemists as a superb organizer of research.\\" (APS website) As the dark events foreshadowing World War II pushed eminent Jewish scientists out of Europe, Clarke opened his laboratory to refugee biochemists, among them E. Brand, Erwin Chargaff, Zacharias Dische, K. Meyer, David Nachmansohn, Rudolph Schoenheimer, and Heinrich Waelsch.APS website As head of Columbia's Biochemistry Department, Clarke took a personal interest in graduate students, of whom he demanded rigorous qualifications prior to admission. As time went on he devoted less time to his own research, becoming inundated with departmental and professional responsibilities.\\"Other responsibilities interrupted his work, including the 1953 memorial lectures for his friend Henry Dankin (sic), and subsequent arrangements for this event at Adelphi College every year to 1965.\\" (APS website) Clarke's time at Kodak resulted in few publications in the chemical literature, but he aided the preparation of 26 substances to the Organic Syntheses series, and checked some 65 others. He stayed associated with Kodak for the rest of his life, only retiring as a consultant in 1969. Among other researches, he was involved in the production of penicillin in the United States. Clarke retired from Columbia in 1956 due to its mandatory retirement policy, but was able to move to Yale University, where he spent eight years in full-time research. When Yale required the space that he was occupying\\". . Clarke . . continued his research and some lecturing and conducting student seminars at the Biochemical Laboratories of the Graduate School of Yale University, to which he had been invited by Joseph Fruton. This arrangement was disrupted when the Medical School needed the space Clarke was occupying in the laboratory to accommodate newly appointed members of its staff in 1964. Clarke was able to continue his research at the Children's Cancer Research Foundation Center in Boston until 1970, when ill health forced him to retire.\\" he moved again, and did another seven years' work at the Children's Cancer Relief Foundation in Boston, Massachusetts. Honors, awards, professional societies Clarke was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1942, and served on the boards of the Journal of the American Chemical Society and of the Journal of Biological Chemistry. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society, the American Chemical Society, the American Otological Society, and the American Society of Biological Chemists. He is probably best known for his work on the eponymously named Eschweiler- Clarke reaction. In 1973 his widow donated his voluminous personal and research papers to the American Philosophical Society. Clarke was named Assistant Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1944, which placed him in charge of coordinating penicillin production in the United States. Clarke served as Science attach√© to the US Embassy in London (1951‚Äì52). He was able to work closely with Sir Robert Robinson, with whom he had edited a major book on research in penicillin (issued in 1949).APS website Clarke was chairman of the Rochester section of the American Chemical Society (1921), of the New York section (1946) and of the Organic Chemistry Division (1924‚Äì25). He worked on the Committee on Professional Training, and the Garvin Award Committee. He was a president of the American Society of Biological Chemists (1947). He served on several grant-allocating committees. As a member of the Otological Society he served on a grants committee from 1956 to 1962. He was Chairman of the Merck Fellowship Board of the National Academy of Sciences in 1957. Clarke was much in demand for his talents as a lucid writer and was called on to serve as editor or referee throughout his career. He sat on the editorial board of Organic Syntheses (1921‚Äì32), and on the editorial board of the Journal of Biological Chemistry (1937‚Äì51), and was associate editor of the Journal of the American Chemical Society (1928‚Äì38)American Philosophical Society website, Hans Thacher Clarke Papers, accessed 27 June 2012 Clarke was an expert clarinet player, and received numerous requests to perform.

Licensed to Univision Radio in Georgetown, Texas, United States, it serves the Austin area. The station has a transmitter in Georgetown and has studios along MoPac Expressway in Northwest Austin. History =Sign-on, Austin's original alternative= KNNC's early 90s \\"Psychobaby\\" logo.The station signed on the air In October 1991 as \\"107.7 K-Nack\\" KNNC, giving Austin its first commercial Alternative/Modern Rock-formatted station under the ownership of Rees- Slaymaker Radio Partnership. The station, always hampered by its relatively small 3 kW signal broadcasting from the far northeastern corner of the market, faced competition in 1995 when Sinclair Telecable launched 101X on its Austin rimshot, KROX-FM. At the time, KROX was licensed to Giddings and, while it broadcast with a full 100 kilowatts, its tower was located between Bastrop and La Grange and only provided listenable coverage to southeastern portions of the Austin market. In 1997, Sinclair (a Virginia-based radio operator, not to be confused with Sinclair Broadcasting) leased KNNC and began simulcasting 101X on 107.7 to supplement KROX's then-weak northern metro signal. =Sale to Simmons, flip to classic hits= Later in 1997, Rees-Slaymaker sold KNNC to Utah-based Simmons Media Group, who ended the 101X simulcast and flipped 107.7 to a 70s-based Classic Hits format as \\"107.7 the Hawk\\" KAHK. As the 80s Hits format was picking up steam nationally in the early 2000s, Simmons flipped KAHK to an 80s-based format as \\"107.7 the End, Austin's 80s Channel\\" KTND in February 2001. After only about a year, KTND shifted to Modern Rock, placing the station back into competition with KROX (which by that time had relicensed to Buda and upgraded its facilities to fully cover the Austin market.) =Switch to Spanish= Simmons began divesting stations outside of its home market of Salt Lake City in 2003, with KTND being sold to Univision, along with their entire Albuquerque station cluster. Univision's purchase of the station was their entry into the Austin radio market, and was preceded by the purchase of TV station KAKW in 2002. Upon taking control of the station in April 2003, Univision launched Regional Mexican \\"La Invasora\\" on the station, which was recalled KINV. Univision changed formats on the station again in 2005, and KINV became Latin Classic Hits \\"Recuerdo 107.7\\". In 2008, following the demise of the Latin Pop format on what was then KXXS (98.9), KINV flipped to Latin Pop as \\"Hitz 107.7\\" KHZS. Just shy of Hitz 107.7's first birthday, KHZS returned to Regional Mexican format as \\"La Jefa\\" on October 16, 2009. On September 11, 2013, La Jefa moved to sister station KLQB (104.3) and KLJA shifted to a younger-skewing version of the Regional Mexican format as \\"El Sancho 107.7\\", \\"El Sancho\\"‚Äîtranslating colloquially to \\"the other one\\"‚Äîhas a double meaning: an \\"alternative\\" (as in: to KLQB's programming) or \\"the other man\\" (as in: a \\"mister\\").

From the 1920s to 1990 the Blue Hole was a tourist site, attracting 165,000 visitors annually at the height of its popularity, partly because of its location on State Route 269, about southwest of the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. The Blue Hole captured the public‚Äôs interest because of its size, about in diameter, clarity, vibrant blue hue, and enigmatic \\"bottomless\\" appearance. Contrary to prevalent belief, the depth of the Blue Hole is not unknown, but has been sounded and found to be about deep. Water temperature is about throughout the year. Floods and droughts have no effect on temperature or water level. The Blue Hole is fed by a passing underground stream which discharges of water daily into Sandusky Bay to the north, feeding into Lake Erie. The water contains lime, soda, magnesia and iron, and because the Blue Hole is anoxic, it cannot naturally sustain fish. The surrounding terrain is developed on limestone bedrock and exhibits karst topography due to dissolution of the limestone by ground water, creating water-filled sinkholes. The Blue Hole was known to American Indians and was first recorded in history in 1761. Several similar blue holes are known to local residents. The Blue Hole that once was a tourist attraction is now off limits to the public. It is located on the grounds of Castalia Trout Club a privately owned trout club .

It was established in 1851 by a group of Mormon settlers who refused to follow the main group led by Brigham Young into the Salt Lake Valley of Utah. Among those settlers was Emily Trask Cutler, one of the plural wives of Heber C. Kimball, counselor to Young and daughter of John Alpheus Cutler, who founded the Cutlerite sect at Manti, Iowa while en route with the main body to the Salt Lake Valley. While there is no evidence that the founding group of the settlement had doctrinal differences with the main body of the church or were affiliated with the Cutlerite church, it is possible that they were opposed to the doctrine of polygamy inasmuch as Emily Cutler Kimball did not accompany the main group. It is equally likely that the group saw no need to go so far west when new frontier lands were open and available in the Kansas Territory and were actively recruiting new settlers from anti- slavery parts of the country. However, the Mormon settlement did not last. Emily Cutler Kimball died not long after the settlement was established and is buried there. Two other Mormon women died there also, and until the mid-1960s the stones were still evident. Some of the settlers moved to Utah within the next two to five years as violence from the chaos of Bleeding Kansas intensified, while others may have given up their Mormon identity and blended in with the local populace. The town was renamed Thompsonville in 1865 by C. L. Thompson, who erected a mill on the site of the old Mormon settlement of 1851. A post office was established in 1878 with C. T. Tolles as postmaster. The community is located on the Delaware River, about 11 miles (17¬Ω km) southwest of Oskaloosa, the county seat, and 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Perry.

Issues were published monthly. It was headquartered in Santa Barbara, California. While some references cite the price as having been US$3.50 an issue, it was advertised in Creative Computing magazine in May 1983 as $45 a year for 12 issues, $25 for 6 issues, or $5 each.Trs-80 strings The first issue contained 5 Basic programs and the \\"cover\\" of the electronic magazine (which had to be loaded onto a TRS-80 Color Computer and then run) was dynamic. Included with each cassette was a 5-6 page newsletter explaining the programs included on the cassette, including their PMODE and PCLEAR values (if needed), their locations on tape, and several paragraphs of documentation about each (sometimes suggesting program alterations that change or improve the results). The newsletter contained tips, rumors (for example whether the TRS-80 Color Computer would soon support 5\\" floppy diskette drives in addition to cassettes for loading and recording software programs), along with other insights. They contained a variety of information about the Color Computer and some of the hardware and software available for it. In addition, they included advertisements. Dave signed only his first name to the CLOAD and Chromasette letters. How cassettes were produced (from comment from David Lagerquist in the April 1983 issue) \\"How do we duplicate the 6000 or so cassettes we send out each month? Rose just doesn't sleep! Really, the programs are read off a disk and sent through a line amplifier to 30 cassette recorders hooked up in parallel. The recorders are controlled by a Color Computer through the microphone jack. The 'random' clicking of 30 buttons lets us know that the tapes are done and that it's time to put in some more blank ones.

Students are drawn equally from the Morningside Heights, Manhattan/Upper West Side/Harlem community and from the faculty and staff of the university. Currently there are three divisions: Primary (K-2), Intermediate (3-5) and Middle (6-8). Each division has its own Division Head and there is one Head of School. It is located at 110th Street and Broadway in the New York City borough of Manhattan. History In 2000, Columbia University decided to develop a school that would serve the needs of its faculty and would also serve the community. The 13-story site (a mixed faculty housing and school building) was decided on in 2001 and construction started later that year. The school officially opened on September 17, 2003. Admissions The school has an admissions policy that is unusual for private schools in New York City in that incoming children are not screened for ability. Each incoming kindergarten class is made up of two groups of children, one group is drawn from the children of Columbia University faculty and staff, while the second group is drawn from the community of New York City School Districts 3 and 5. Children of Columbia faculty and staff are chosen through a mix of retention requirements, cross-department representation and a lottery.The School at Columbia University : Provost Letter Children from the community are selected through a random lottery with no screening and every incoming community child is eligible for financial aid on a needs basis. After winning the lottery, parents can schedule a tour the school and children are invited for a 2-hour visit where they spend time in a kindergarten classroom with other applicants The School at Columbia University : Admissions However, the application process includes \\"...an assessment by The School to confirm it can serve the child.\\" https://www.theschool.columbia.edu/admissions/application-process/columbia- families, which even for children who \\"win the lottery\\" or are otherwise guaranteed a slot through their department, can result in denial of admission for reasons relating to learning needs the School purports it cannot serve (despite the presence of other children in The School who receive such services).

It houses law enforcement exhibits, a memorial and a Hall of Fame.MuseumsUSA. \\"American Police Hall of Fame & Museum Titusville, Florida\\", MuseumsUSA website, 2007. Retrieved on October 25, 2007. It is the nation's first national police museum and a memorial dedicated to law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. The museum was founded in 1960 in North Port, Florida by Gerald Arenberg. He was a police officer injured in the line of duty by a drunk driver in 1955. It was his dream to build a memorial to honor all law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, those that paid the ultimate sacrifice to keep the peace, to protect, and to serve. The museum was moved from North Port to the former FBI building in Miami, Florida in 1990. This building had 3 floors, housing the museum on the first 2 floors and the administration offices on the 3rd floor. By 2000 this facility became too small to house the growing number of exhibits, as well as the growing number of names in the memorial. In 2001, building began on the museum in Titusville. This facility opened in May, 2003. The Space Coast area was chosen because of its proximity to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame, and of course, Orlando.http://www.afp- cc.org/aphfvolunteerapplication.pdf The museum is supported and maintained by the National Association of Chiefs of Police. U.S. National Police Surgeon Linval K. Fleetwood MD, nominated by Chief Arenberg and appointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton, served the mission of the Hall of Fame & Museum from 1996 to 2007 by advising Congress about police issues, performing ceremonies for officers killed in the line of duty, and providing counseling for the families of those officers.

It is the title track and lead single of her second studio album, which was released in 1992. The song became a huge success in Brazil and it is widely known as one of Mercury's signature songs. Song information The lyrics of \\"O Canto da Cidade\\", which were written by Mercury herself and Tote Gira, are quite simple. They are basically about a girl advising a partner that she is trying to leave her ‚Äì or a possible love interest, depending on the point of view ‚Äì that he should stay with her, because she is the \\"chant\\" and the \\"color\\" of the town they live in. Music video The music video of \\"O Canto da Cidade\\" was directed by Patr√≠cia Prata. It begins with Mercury singing the song while she walks through the streets of her native Salvador. As the beat of the song gets faster, Mercury starts to dance. There are also some other scenes of Mercury (wearing a dress similar to the one on the album's cover) and others dancing in yellow, black and white backgrounds. Chart performance \\"O Canto da Cidade\\" was released as the first single from the eponymous album in mid-1992. The song, as well as the album, is widely regarded as responsible for taking both Mercury's career and ax√© music to mainstream audiences. Legacy \\"O Canto da Cidade\\" is remembered for being the number one song in Brazil at the time of Fernando Collor's impeachment process and the subsequent economic crisis. Nelson Motta states, in his book Noites Tropicais, that Mercury and her song were responsible for bringing back some of the country's joy and self-esteem at a time of harsh crisis. At a recent concert in Goi√¢nia, Mercury stated that during the crisis the new generation regained interest in the Brazilian popular music and that her song was, in part, responsible for this. Awards In late 1992, \\"O Canto da Cidade\\" received a special Sharp Award for Song of the Year.

The rhythm track was laid down on 15 January and Elvis' vocal overdub on the 21st. The song reached #6 in the U.S.[Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-2002] and #8 in the U.K. Live recordings were made during his second season in Las Vegas during February 1970 and several of these have been released. However, during the dinner show on 13 August 1970 at the International Hotel he recorded a version that led seamlessly into \\"In the Ghetto\\". Duet In 1997 Lisa Marie Presley made a video of \\"Don't Cry Daddy\\", where she sings it as a duet with her father. This video was presented on August 16, 1997, at the tribute concert that marked the 20th anniversary of Elvis' death. The video has Elvis' original vocal, to which new instrumentation and Lisa Marie's vocals were added. The recording was not for commercial use. The song created a renewed interest in her as a recording artist, displaying as it did the husky timbre in her voice. Concept The song takes place in the mind of the husband of the wife and mother who is no longer present. (It is not stated in the lyrics whether her absence is due to death, marital separation, divorce or abandonment). The characters are the father, one of his unnamed children, and a young child named Tommy. The unnamed child begs the father not to cry, saying they will find a new \\"mommy\\", and urges the father to play with the children as they did in happier times.

It is located near Silverado in Trabuco Canyon, Orange County, California. History The building is named for Andrew Jackson Cook, a merchant who acquired of land in the South Orange County area. The building was constructed not long after, in 1884. In 1926, Cook's son, Earl Jack \\"E.J.\\" Cook, converted the structure into a restaurant meant to supply food to miners and local ranchers. Seven years later, after the end of the Prohibition period, alcohol began being sold again, and Cook's was converted into a bar. The Cook family sold Cook's, which included the bar, the Cook's family house, and about 40 acres of land to two owners, Victor Villa and Volker Streicek, of the Santa Ana, California based motorcycle accessories company Cheat'ah Engineering in 1975. The Cook family purchased a ranch in Montana and moved out of Southern California. Volker and Victor had founded Cheat'ah Engineering in 1969, along with Ron Rondeau. They purchased Cook's as an investment, but also as a place where motorcycle clubs could gather in peace. Volker and Victor were proud of the fact that Cook's was a place to party with very few fights between motorcycle clubs and patrons.

History The old bridge (1828-1829).jpg The story of this bridge started in 1821, when engineer Claude Navier conceived a technologically revolutionary bridge that crossed the Seine in one single reach without any point of support in between. The proposed suspension bridge, the construction of which started in 1824, was meant to be erected opposite to the Hotel des Invalides on the site of the current Pont Alexandre III. Navier failed to leave a safety margin on top of his calculations, and the contract to build the bridge was unusually rigid. After Navier's plan had been approved by the private investment company, the contractor could not make changes without approval, and there was no authorization to suggest improvements.The Paris Bridge That Never Was The bridge became unsafe after cracking of the anchorages due to natural settling and additional movement after a water main break near the buttresses. The bridge had to be dismantled, and Navier was chastised by a government committee for relying too much on mathematics. He was even compared unfavorably to the accomplishments of (French rival) British bridge builders.Engines of our Ingenuity No. 2832: Claude-Louis Navier After a settlement between the contractor and investors was reached, the raw materials were reused for other bridges, with designs to be provided by the head investor Alain Desjardins, which were widely seen as less elegant. In response to complaints from the defenders of the Invalides perspective, the Public Services decided to shift the bridge site downriver. Therefore, in 1829, two engineers, de Verges and Bayard de la Vingtrie, completed the construction of a proper suspension bridge supported by two piers in the Seine and three porticos, each 20 m in height. Unfortunately, due to rapidly growing wear on the bridge, its access had to be regulated in 1850. In 1854, the bridge was demolished to be replaced by a new one in time for the upcoming 1855 World Fair in Paris. Paul-Martin Gallocher de Lagalisserie and Jules Savarin used the existing piers of the former suspension bridge and a newly added central pier to build an arch bridge in masonry on the same site. The new pier was adorned with sculptures in two allegorical themes: the Land Victory by Victor Vilain upriver; the Maritime Victory by Georges Di√©bolt downstream, whereas the two old piers were adorned with sculptures of military trophies bearing the imperial coat of arms, both the work of Astyanax-Sc√©vola Bosio. Despite being stronger, the new bridge still sustained a subsidence between 25 and 30 cm in 1878, and lost two arches during the winter of 1880 (restored by the end of the year). The bridge has been quite secure since then and the only modification made in the 20th century was the expansion of its pavement in 1956.

The data submitted to the Line Information Database is maintained by a customer's carrier, and most incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) like the Baby Bells, and competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) provide access for customers.

Caller ID name information is not transmitted from the originating office to the destination office. It is the terminating carrier that is responsible for providing the caller ID information to its customers. The carrier performs a database lookup using the caller's telephone number to obtain the name information for the caller ID service.

Map of Yorkshire showing historical boundaries in England The culture of Yorkshire has developed over the county's history, influenced by the cultures of those who came to control the region, including the Celts (Brigantes and Parisii), Romans, Angles, Vikings and Normans. Yorkshire people are said to have a strong sense of regional identity and have been viewed to identify more strongly with their county than their country. The Yorkshire dialect and accent is distinctive, although use of dialect words is receding. Traditions and stereotypes A flat cap associated with the stereotypical Yorkshireman A man dressed in traditional Yorkshire attire takes his horse for a turn of the field in front of the crowd at Otley Show. Many Yorkshire people are immensely proud of both their county and their identity, embracing the popular nickname of God's Own County given to Yorkshire. The most common stereotype of a Yorkshire person is as tight with money: there is a British saying that \\"a Yorkshireman is a Scotsman with all the generosity squeezed out of him\\", which references how Scots are also stereotyped as being tight but not as tight as Yorkshire folk. This stereotype can also be seen in the Yorkshireman's Motto: :'Ear all, see all, say nowt; :Eyt all, sup all, pay nowt; :And if ivver tha does owt fer nowt ‚Äì :Allus do it fer thissen. Translation: 'Hear all, see all, say nothing; Eat all, drink all, pay nothing; And if ever you do anything for nothing ‚Äì always do it for yourself.'' Yorkshire people are often stereotyped as friendly but \\"bloody- minded\\", stubborn (also known as \\"Yorkshire-stubborn\\") and argumentative. Indeed, throughout the history of the area, dating from the tribal Brigantes, through the Norman period and the Wars of the Roses, the region has seen a number of rebellions against non-Yorkshire or non-Northern rulers. It is this stereotype which is referred to in the saying 'You can always tell a Yorkshireman, but you can't tell him much'. However, the popular understanding of the Wars of the Roses is mostly false. The House of York had its support mostly in southern England, while northern England on either side of the Pennines mainly supported the House of Lancaster. Indeed, the city of York itself was a Lancastrian power base. Yorkshire is often described as \\"God's own county/country\\" due to its beautiful landscape and unspoiled countryside One social stereotype of a Yorkshireman had a tendency to include such accessories as a flat cap and a whippet; this alludes to rural life. While the stereotype might not always ring true, the county certainly has an illustrious rural history; many of the now prominent West Yorkshire cities grew thanks in part to the wool industry. Another stereotype often heard in connection with Yorkshire workers is the proverb \\"where there's muck, there's brass\\"; this refers to the widely held view that where one is willing to do unpalatable work, there is plenty of money to be made. Tyke or Yorkie is now a colloquialism used to identify the Yorkshire dialect, as well as the term some Yorkshiremen affectionately use to describe themselves, especially in the West Riding. Originally \\"tyke\\" was a highly derogatory word, meaning \\"a crude uncouth ill-bred person lacking culture or refinement\\"; southerners used the term against Yorkshiremen, but in defiance of the negative connotations it was adopted locally, taking on a new life. Long Sword dancers Among Yorkshire's unique traditions is the Long Sword dance, a traditional dance not found elsewhere in England. The most famous song of Yorkshire is On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at (\\"On Ilkley Moor without a hat\\"); it is considered the unofficial anthem of the county. In celebration of its culture, Yorkshire Day has been celebrated annually on 1 August since 1975. Amongst the celebrations is a civic gathering of Lord Mayors, Mayors and other civic heads from across the county, convened by the Yorkshire Society. Food and drink The cuisine of Yorkshire and that of Northern England in general is known for its rich ingredients, especially in sweet dishes. Below is a list of foods which either originated from Yorkshire or are strongly associated with it. Yorkshire puddings, served as part of a traditional Sunday roast. *Yorkshire pudding ‚Äì far and away the most well known element of Yorkshire food, it is commonly served with roast beef, vegetables and potatoes, to form part of the standard Sunday roast, which itself grew from the county. It is created from batter and in most cases that it is eaten, the dish includes gravy. In its traditional form, it is easily large enough to fill the plate. It is eaten before the main meal as a starter ‚Äì the idea being that you would then not want to eat as much of the more expensive meat. It can also be served as a savoury dish with onions and herbs as part of the batter mix but can also be served afterwards with jam. It is only those from outside the county who think it must be served with the main meal. *Yorkshire curd tart ‚Äì a curd tart recipe which has been around since at least the 1750s, unique because of its use of rosewater. *Parkin ‚Äì a sweet ginger cake which is different from standard ginger cakes in that it includes oatmeal and treacle as part of the traditional recipe. *Gingerbread, one unusual form of gingerbread from Yorkshire has a layer of crystallised ginger in the middle, rather than an essence of ginger or ginger shavings. *Liquorice sweet ‚Äì the plant was thought to have been brought over to Yorkshire by returning Crusaders or Dominican friars in the 14th century. It became synonymous with Pontefract in Yorkshire, as local man George Dunhill in the 1760s thought to mix it with sugar, creating what was known locally as \\"Pomfret cakes\\", but is now well known as \\"liquorice\\". As liquorice requires deep soil to grow, it was mainly grown in Pontefract. Although it is no longer grown in the area, Pontefract has two large confectionery factories as a legacy. *Wensleydale cheese ‚Äì a cheese associated with Wensleydale in North Yorkshire; the local pastures give the cheese the unique flavour for which it is renowned *Ginger beer ‚Äì a beverage flavoured with ginger, it has existed since the mid-1700s. *Rhubarb: The Yorkshire Rhubarb Triangle is a triangle in West Yorkshire, between Wakefield, Morley and Rothwell, famous for producing early forced rhubarb which is harvested by candlelight. In February 2010, Yorkshire Forced Rhubarb was awarded Protected Designation of Origin status under the European Commission's Protected Food Name scheme after being recommended by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, (Defra). From the 1700s onwards, Yorkshire, and in particular the city of York, saw the growth of several chocolate factories or companies, forming an important part of the confectionery industry and now with globally known products. These include: *Rowntree's (York) ‚Äì produced Kit Kat, Smarties, Aero, Fruit Pastilles, Black Magic and Polo. *Terry's (York) ‚Äì produced Terry's Chocolate Orange, York Fruits, Neapolitans and Terry's All Gold. *Thorntons (Sheffield) ‚Äì involved in the field of luxury chocolate such as chocolate truffles. *Bassett's (Sheffield) - who accidentally invented liquorice allsorts in 1899 and still retain their factory in Hillsborough. *Mackintosh's (Halifax) ‚Äì produced Quality Street and toffee. *A.L. Simpkin & Co. Ltd (Sheffield) ‚Äì Manufactures the world's first Airtight Glucose Travel Tin Sweets. Yorkshire is also a historic centre for the brewing of beer, with breweries such as Tetley's, John Smith's, Sam Smith's, Black Sheep, Theakston, Timothy Taylor and Copper Dragon. Sport Yorkshire has played a highly important role in the development of sports, some forms of which have become world-famous. Sport is important in the modern culture of the county. The main sports are football, cricket and rugby league. In the London 2012 Olympics, competitors from Yorkshire won 7 gold medals, 2 silver and 3 bronze. If Yorkshire had been treated as a country it would have come twelfth in the overall medal table. =Cricket= Herbert Sutcliffe, batsman. Yorkshire County Cricket Club represents the historic county at first-class cricket. It competes in the County Championship against 17 others, playing at their home ground of Headingley, Leeds. and occasionally North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough, Yorkshire is by far the most successful in the history of the championship: they have won the title 32 times (outright). Their nearest competitor in titles achieved is Surrey, who have won it 19 times (outright). They participate in a derby with Lancashire County Cricket Club known as the Roses Match, named after the Wars of the Roses. The first cricket club in Yorkshire is thought to have been Sheffield Cricket Club, founded in 1751. Some players from Yorkshire have been highly acclaimed in the general history of the sport, including Herbert Sutcliffe, Sir Leonard Hutton, Wilfred Rhodes, George Herbert Hirst, Fred Trueman and Geoffrey Boycott. Aside from the county club and its achievements, Yorkshiremen have also made a distinct mark on cricket in general: Thomas Lord founded Lord's Cricket Ground in London. As for umpires, the man regarded as the most famous and a figure synonymous with cricket, Dickie Bird, is from Barnsley. =Football= Brazilian legend Pel√© (left) in Sheffield in November 2007, marking the 150th anniversary of the world's oldest football club, Sheffield F.C. Yorkshire is officially recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, as Sheffield F.C. who were founded in 1857 are certified as the oldest association football club in the world. South Yorkshire hosted the first ever inter-club match and the first ever local derby on 26 December 1860; between Sheffield FC and Hallam FC. South Yorkshire is also home to what is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the Oldest Ground in the World, Sandygate Road. The Sheffield rules code was highly influential to the development of the FA's Laws of the Game, which is now the worldwide standard code for the game and happened to be drafted by Ebenezer Cobb Morley from Hull. In 1961 Rotherham United played in the first League Cup Final, when they lost 3‚Äì2 to Aston Villa in two legs, they won the first 2‚Äì0, but lost the second 3‚Äì0. Yorkshire clubs compete in the English football league system. While they are by no means the most dominant footballing county, Yorkshire has produced several national league winners, some of whom have won the title more than once, including Sheffield Wednesday, Leeds United, Huddersfield Town and Sheffield United. Some players from Yorkshire have gone on to become some of the most highly regarded in the history of the game, including World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks and two time European Footballer of the Year award winner Kevin Keegan. =Rugby= Harold Wagstaff ‚Äì Prince of the Centres. Originally Yorkshire clubs formed part of the Rugby Football Union which covered all of England under the same code. They took part in competitions such as the Yorkshire Cup. The sport was popular amongst the working class of the North, whilst in the South it was a middle-class man's game. This was a problem in the pre- professional era for the Yorkshire clubs, as the working class were limited by the need to earn a wage and did not have as much recreational time; it was against the rules for clubs to pay players. In 1895 the rugby schism took place, creating the sport of rugby league in Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire. The association they founded is still based in the North and is known as the Rugby Football League. Although some Yorkshire clubs now play rugby union, Rugby League is the main rugby focus for the county; of the 24 clubs who have competed in the Super League, 11 are from Yorkshire. The five most decorated Yorkshire clubs in terms of league titles are Huddersfield Giants, Hull FC, Bradford Bulls, Hull Kingston Rovers and Leeds Rhinos. In total, six Yorkshiremen have been inducted into the British Rugby League Hall of Fame: Harold Wagstaff, Jonty Parkin, Roger Millward, Neil Fox, Billy Batten and Ellery Hanley. =Ferret legging= The origin of ferret legging is disputed. The sport seems to have become popular among coal miners in Yorkshire, England, in the 1970s, though some Scots claim it gained popularity in Scotland. According to Marlene Blackburn of the Richmond Ferret Rescue League, ferret legging originated in public houses \\"where patrons would bet on who could keep a ferret in his pants the longest.\\" The sport may alternatively have originated during the time when only the relatively wealthy in England were allowed to keep ferrets used for hunting, forcing the animal poachers to hide their illicit ferrets in their trousers to avoid detection by gamekeepers. This was also done by poachers and hunters to keep the animals warm in the cold weather. Retired miner Reg Mellor, from Barnsley, set the new world record time of five hours and twenty-six minutes on 5 July 1981 at the Annual Pennine Show at Holmfirth, Yorkshire. He had practised the sport since his youth, but had received no recognition until he set the new world record. Mellor, who had hunted with ferrets in the dales outside of Barnsley for many years, had grown accustomed to keeping them in his trousers to keep them warm and dry when out working in the rain. Mellor's \\"trick\\" was to ensure that the ferrets were well-fed before they were inserted into his trousers. In 1986, Mellor attempted to break his own record before a crowd of 2,500 spectators, intending to beat the \\"magic six-hour mark‚Äîthe four-minute mile of ferret legging\\". After five hours, most of the attendees had become bored and left; workmen arrived to dismantle the stage, despite Mellor's protests that he was on his way to a new record. According to Adrian Tame of the Sunday Herald Sun, Mellor retired after that experience, \\"disillusioned and broken-hearted,\\" but with his dignity and manhood intact. Mellor had hoped to organise an annual national competition held in his home town of Barnsley, and offered a prize of ¬£100 to anyone who could beat him. =Others= In other sports, people from that county have also had success. \\"Prince\\" Naseem Hamed from Sheffield, was one of the most famous boxers of the 1990s; he won world championships in the Bantamweight (EBU) and Featherweight (IBF, IBO, WBC and WBO) divisions. Yorkshire has produced several noted athletes; 100 metre runner Dorothy Hyman won three gold medals in the Commonwealth Games and one in the European Athletics Championships, middle-distance runner Peter Elliott also won gold at the Commonwealth Games. Adrian Moorhouse was a gold medal winning Olympian in swimming, earning victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics, he also won gold at three European Championships and three Commonwealth Games. Yorkshire hosted the grand depart of the 2014 Tour de France. The county has produced many successful racing cyclists over the years. Notable male cyclists include Brian Robinson, the first British rider to finish and to win stages of the Tour de France, Barry Hoban, winner of eight Tour de France stages and two stages of the Vuelta a Espa√±a, Malcolm Elliott, winner of the points classification at the 1989 Vuelta a Espa√±a, Ed Clancy, a double Olympic and five time World Championship gold medallist on the track and Ben Swift, also a track cycling World Champion. Successful female cyclists include Beryl Burton, a double road cycling and five time track cycling World Champion, former individual pursuit World Champion Yvonne McGregor and World Championship track gold medallist and Olympic road racing silver medallist Lizzie Armitstead. Literature There are several instances of the county providing an important role in literature. Perhaps the most famous literacy association is that between Whitby in North Yorkshire and Bram Stoker's Dracula. When Stoker wrote the novel, he lived in Whitby, and parts of the novel are set there. It includes several stories of Whitby folklore such as the beaching of the Russian ship Dmitri, which became the basis of Demeter in the book. Today there is a Dracula Museum in the town, celebrating the association. In terms of poetry, one of the most well known from Yorkshire is Andrew Marvell from Winestead-in-Holderness, he was noted for writing metaphysical poetry during the 1600s, and his association with several other noted British poets from the era. The Bront√´ sisters The Bront√´ sisters ‚Äì Anne, Charlotte and Emily‚Äîwere all Yorkshirewomen born in Thornton and raised in Haworth, West Yorkshire. Their novels, written in the mid 1800s, caused a sensation when they were first published and were subsequently accepted into the canon of great English literature. Amongst the most noted novels credited to the sisters are Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Emily's Wuthering Heights. Ted Hughes wrote two collections that show his love for Yorkshire: Remains of Elmet (1979) and Elmet (1994), in which the ghost of Emily Bront√´ still haunts the moor. In the present day, the most prominent Yorkshire presences in English literature are the playwright, author, actor, screenwriter and commentator Alan Bennett, born 1934 in Leeds, where much of his work is set, and the poet, playwright and screenwriter Tony Harrison, born three years later in the same city. Music =Folk music= Yorkshire has a rich heritage of folk music and folk dance including particularly Long Sword dance. Folk songs were collected in the region from the 19th century, and it probably had more attention than other northern counties, but its rich heritage of northern and industrial folk song was relatively neglected.; ; It was not until the second folk revival in the 1950s that Nigel and Mary Hudleston began to attempt to redress the balance, collecting a large number of Yorkshire songs between 1958 and 1978. and Yorkshire folk song lacked the unique instrumental features of folk in areas like Northumbria and was chiefly distinguished by the use of dialect, particularly in the West Riding and exemplified by the song On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at, probably written in the later 19th century and using a Kent folk tune (almost certainly borrowed via a Methodist hymnal), but often seen as an unofficial Yorkshire anthem. Most Yorkshire folk songs were not unique and tended to be adapted to fit local geography and dialect, as with probably the most commercially successful Yorkshire song, Scarborough Fair, recorded by Simon and Garfunkel, which was a version of the Scottish ballad The Elfin Knight. One unusual piece of music is the unique choral folk song, probably derived from an 18th-century ballad, known as the Holmfirth Anthem or Pratty Flowers. The most eminent folk performers from the county are the Watersons from Hull, who began recording Yorkshire versions of folk songs from 1965, and members of which are still performing today. Also famous is the Leeds-born musician Jake Thackray, who became famous in the 1970s for singing witty, often bawdy songs, many of which related to rural Yorkshire life, in a style derived from the French chansonnier tradition. His work led him to be described by some as the \\"Northern Noel Coward\\". Other Yorkshire folk musicians include Heather Wood (b. 1945) of the Young Tradition, the short- lived electric folk group Mr Fox (1970‚Äì2), The Deighton Family, Julie Matthews, Kathryn Roberts, and the Mercury Prize nominated Kate Rusby. Yorkshire has a flourishing folk music culture, with over forty folk clubs and thirty annual folk music festivals. In 2007 the Yorkshire Garland Group was formed to make Yorkshire folk songs accessible online and in schools. =Rock and pop music= Jarvis Cocker, singer for Pulp Yorkshire has played a significant part in popular music, starting with the unconventional Arthur Brown in the 1960s. During the following decade David Bowie, himself of a father from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire,\\"Episode for 29 November 2003\\". Parkinson (TV series). hired three musicians from Hull in the form of Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey; together they recorded Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, an album that went on to become highly regarded. Perhaps the most significant time for Yorkshire music in the modern era was the local post-punk scene of the 1980s, where the county produced several significant bands who went on to achieve success, including The Sisters of Mercy, The Cult, Gang of Four, The Human League, Def Leppard, Heaven 17, New Model Army, Soft Cell, Chumbawamba, The Wedding Present, The Mission, The Housemartins, The Beautiful South and The Comsat Angels. Pulp from Sheffield had a massive hit in the form of \\"Common People\\" during 1995, a song focusing on working-class northern England life. The 2000s saw popularity for indie rock and post-punk revival bands from the area with the Kaiser Chiefs and the Arctic Monkeys, the latter holding the record for the fastest- selling debut album in British music history with Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not. Yorkshire has also contributed heavily to the emergence of the electronic music industry from the 1990s until the present day. The nightclubs of Leeds and Sheffield helped to build the foundations for record labels such as Warp Records. The region has also been influential in the development of bassline, producing a huge hit with T2's \\"Heartbroken\\" in 2007, and has produced grime crews such as Scumfam. Music in these and related genres has been championed by Toddla T, a Sheffield-born DJ on BBC radio. Art Particularly notable international artists from Yorkshire included Henry Moore (sculptor) and David Hockney (painter). In 1925, the Fylingdales Group of Artists was founded at Denton Hawley‚Äôs studio in Robin Hood's Bay. See also a list of artists and sculptors from Yorkshire. Film and television Sean Bean's Yorkshire accent is highly recognised and is utilised on many of his castings including Game of Thrones Stark accent. Three prominent British television shows filmed in (and based around) Yorkshire are sitcom Last of the Summer Wine, drama series Heartbeat and Emmerdale, the latter two of which are produced by Yorkshire Television. All Creatures Great and Small, based on books by James Herriot, was set in Yorkshire and exterior shots were filmed there. The television drama Downton Abbey, although set in Yorkshire, is actually filmed in Berkshire and at Ealing Studios, London. Last of the Summer Wine, in particular, is noted for holding the record of longest- running comedy series in the world, from 1973 until 2010. Open All Hours and its continuation Still Open All Hours are set and filmed in Doncaster. Several noted films are set in Yorkshire, including Kes, Four Lions, This Sporting Life, Calendar Girls, God's Own Country (2017 film) and Room at the Top. A comedy film set in Sheffield named The Full Monty, won an Academy Award and was voted the second best British film of all-time in a 2007 poll by Radio Times. Threads, a docu-drama about nuclear winter, was set and filmed in Sheffield. The county is also referenced in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life during a segment on birth where title card read, \\"The Miracle of Birth, Part II ‚Äî The Third World\\". The scene then opened into a mill town street, subtitled \\"Yorkshire\\". Monty Python were also known to perform the Four Yorkshiremen sketch live, which first featured on At Last the 1948 Show.

It is located at 172 Richardson Road in the newly developed suburb of Spring Farm.  History  The lands for the original church building and cemetery were marked out by Surveyor Hoddle in 1827 but little was done until the 1830s probably due to the size of the town and lack of community support. On 10 November 1839 the first church building was officially opened. This building was to serve the Anglican community at Narellan until 1884 and became known as the School Church. Built by the Reverend Thomas Hassall, it was used as a schoolroom on weekdays and a church on Sunday. The present church building in Spring Farm was completed in 2001, and church continues to gather twice weekly at this new site. The former parish church, designed by Edmund Blacket, is no longer owned by the Anglican Church. The Revd Dr John Bunyan, a Fellow and Past President of the Anglican Historical Society (Diocese of Sydney, and a Patron of the Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society), notes that it has become The Old St Thomas Chapel and has been beautifully restored by its private owners. It is used for Christian and civil ceremonies, and for many years now, on Good Friday afternoon it has hosted Evensong (from the Book of Common Prayer) at 2 pm. The historic pioneers' graveyard was also sold by the Anglican Church and is now Muslim-owned, though access to Christian family graves is permitted.

History The original inhabitants of the land were the Gweagal Aborigines who were a clan of the Tharawal (or Dharawal) tribe of Indigenous Australians. They are the traditional custodians of the southern geographic areas of Sydney. The first land grant was issued in 1815. of land on the Kurnell Peninsula which also included Boat Harbour was issued to James Birnie, a whaler and merchant. He named his land ‚ÄòAlpha Farm‚Äô and built himself a cottage. When James Birnie was declared insane in 1828, John Connell gained possession of his property. John Connell passes away in 1848 leaving his estate to his grandsons. In 1861 the property was sold to Thomas Holt who purchased the land for ¬£3275. Holt, originally from Yorkshire, sailed into Sydney sometime in 1842. He made his fortune during the gold rushes of the early 1850s. Holt moved to Sutherland, and further increased the size of his property holdings to approximately . He erected several mansions and ran his ‚ÄòSutherland Estate‚Äô in the English manner.NSW Heritage Office Website - Listing Heritage Items - State Heritage Register - Item View The rock platform and reef on the southern side of Boat Harbour is known as 'The Merries'. The coastline in the area is generally east-west, making it a potential hazard for northbound shipping, especially prior to the building of the Cape Baily Light. In 1895, the Aberdeen White Star Line passenger steamer Ninevah, on its way from London to Sydney, ran aground on this reef, during a fog. About a third of the ship's length was on the reef but she was refloated, without assistance, on the rising tide. In 1898, the Moruya Steamship Company's small coastal steamer, Koonya, ran onto the rocks here at night during heavy rain and broke up. In 1905, the Bellambi Coal Company's collier Marjorie ran aground at night and was stranded on this reef, until part of her cargo was jettisoned and she was relocated. No lives were lost in these incidents. Fishing In late 2001 Boat Harbour became an aquatic reserve. The new reserve will place restrictions on fishing and bait collection. The Deep Blue - Spearfishing in Sydney's Sutherland Shire NPWS: Boat Harbour Aquatic Reserve Wildlife The area contains several habitats which include platforms, crevices, rock-pools, boulders and cobbles. Some of the wildlife includes a variety of birds, such as plovers, ruddy turnstone and red-necked stint. From January to late March 2009, an American golden plover was present with a flock of Pacific golden plovers. This species is very rarely recorded in Australia. Housing There is no permanent housing located on or near the beach, though the site houses many temporary shacks made from corrugated iron or shipping containers. Facilities Boat harbour used to be the location of a 4WD park where driving on beach and sand dunes was permitted. From May 2010 access to the dunes was closed, but beach access remains. Recreational Activities Boat harbour is home of one of the best kitesurfing and windsurfing spot in Sydney Region. It works well in South Easterly or Southerly winds. No entry for Boat or PWC allowed Entry Fee Since it is private property, there is an entry fee of $30 for a day visit and $100 annually per vehicle.

He was born on August 2, 1972, in Brockton, Massachusetts. The Bender family were active in church and at the age of 10 years old, Bender sang an emotional \\"Amazing Grace\\". Bender's musical influences were Michael Jackson, Prince (musician), Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye and New Edition. At the age of 12, Bender met Bobby Jones who owned a studio and helped Bender develop his singing voice. At 14 years old, Bender formed a group with his two brothers and two cousins called \\"Steady Life\\", performing in Brockton. Bender was expelled from Brockton High School at 16 for fighting in school. He went to New York City and met Earl Williams who became his manager and got him a record deal with Epic Records in 1989. Bender was from the Boston, Massachusetts, area, growing up in Brockton and Waltham. At the age of 16, Bender recorded his first album, Chris Bender, for Epic Records. The first single \\"Baby Girl\\" was released in 1989 but limited copies of the album were released. Bender's manager Terryl L. Calloway later stated about Baby Girl: \\" The video was never [released]. \\" Bender nevertheless went on to secure a $500,000 contract with EastWest Records. He signed a seven-album contract, although only one album on that contract was released before his death. The album Draped hit No. 92 on the Billboard magazine R&B; album chart. His two charted singles \\"I Knew\\" and \\"That's Not The Way\\" broke into the top 70 on the Hot R&B; Singles chart.

Bender was sitting in the driver's seat of the car. His 17 year-old cousin, Jesse Starks, was sitting in the passenger‚Äôs seat. Bender and Starks were smoking marijuana and talking when three hooded men approached and fired 21 gunshots at the vehicle. Bender used his body to shield Starks from the gunshots. Starks was unharmed, but Bender was struck four times in the back of his torso and once in his elbow. He later died from his wounds in the hospital. On November 9, 1991, Bender was buried at Melrose Cemetery in Plymouth County in Brockton, Massachusettes. Eroy Kindell was convicted of second degree murder; he was released on parole in 2008.

Hahn was a recurring character through the show's second and third seasons, and joined the main cast in the fourth season. Prior to assuming the role, Smith observed heart surgery being performed, and admitted to finding stressful the pressure of continually portraying a medical professional realistically. The character is presented as highly professional, to the point of being a \\"workaholic\\". She is notably hard on Resident Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), admitting that Cristina reminds her of herself as a student. Despite her intentions to keep away from relationships, she becomes romantically involved with orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). The storyline was praised for its realistic portrayal of a developing same-sex relationship between two women, although consultants from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation expressed some concerns over what they deemed the somewhat exploitative talk of a threesome between Hahn, Torres and Mark Sloan. Hahn was written out of Grey's Anatomy in November 2008, with Smith commenting that the decision originated with the ABC network rather than with series creator Shonda Rhimes.  Storylines  Upon her first appearance in the series it is established that Hahn is a long-time rival of main character and fellow cardiothoracic surgeon Preston Burke, dating back to their days at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where she graduated second after Burke. She is introduced as a cardiothoracic attending surgeon at Seattle Presbyterian Hospital when she and Burke fight over a donor heart. Hahn reappears in season three when she is contacted by George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) for a consult on his father's valve replacement after George finds out about Burke's hand tremors and Cristina helping him cover it up. Hahn transfers to Seattle Grace Hospital in the season four episode, \\"Haunt You Everyday\\", after performing a successful heart transplant at the request of the Chief of Surgery, Richard Webber. She takes on the role previously held by Burke, Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Hahn cultivates an antagonistic relationship with Burke's former prot√©g√©e Cristina Yang, refusing to let her scrub in on surgeries, and constantly criticizing her overly enthusiastic behavior. She later confesses to Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) that she is purposely hard on Cristina, as she reminds her of herself as a Resident. The character deflects the romantic attention of fellow attending Mark Sloan, admitting that she finds him attractive but wishes to keep her private life separate from her working life. She also develops a friendship with Callie Torres which becomes temporarily strained when Callie is led to believe Hahn has romantic designs on her. Although Hahn laughs off the notion, she goes on to kiss Callie in front of Sloan, to prove that he couldn't handle a threesome with the two of them, leaving Callie stunned. In the season four finale, Callie initiates a second passionate kiss, which Hahn reciprocates. The two attempt a romantic relationship, but while Erica comes to terms with her sexuality quickly,Callie is slightly confused with her sexuality because it didn't feel right doing it with Hahn so she quickly goes and sleeps with Sloan to learn how to sleep with Erica Hahn  Development  = Casting and creation = Erica Hahn was initially conceived as a minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: \\"I didn't really think it was going to work out\\", joking that \\"After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too ‚Äì kind of like when I used to be single.\\" However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she \\"didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen.\\" She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: \\"When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is\\". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that \\"I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn‚Äôt go to medical school. I‚Äôm not actually a doctor\\", explaining; \\"I have no idea what it really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I‚Äôve been doing it a long time\\". On November 3, 2008, it was reported by Entertainment Weekly's Michael Ausiello that Erica would depart from Grey's Anatomy on November 6. Series creator Shonda Rhimes issued the statement that: E! Online's Kristin Dos Santos reported that Smith's dismissal from the show was enforced by the ABC network, as part of an attempt to \\"de-gay\\" Grey's Anatomy. She revealed that as well as writing out the character Erica Hahn, Grey's Anatomy newcomer Melissa George would no longer be playing a bisexual character as announced. Brooke Smith, interviewed by Michael Ausiello, stated that: Smith explained that the script for her final episode did not involve her character being written out, and that Erica's final scene on the show is \\"just [her] heading to [her] car.\\" She agreed with the assessment that her dismissal originated from ABC and not Shonda Rhimes herself, stating: \\"it definitely seemed like [Shonda's] hands were tied.\\" Rhimes also said: \\"We didn't have a controversy with Dr. Hahn. The press created a whole thing that had nothing to do with reality.\\" = Characterization = Describing her character's personality, Smith has stated: \\"Dr. Hahn is a workaholic and she's very professional [...] I think she feels that there should be professionalism at work, and when other people do things that aren't professional she gets a little upset.\\", adding: \\"She has little rules in her head about how you‚Äôre supposed to act at work. That doesn‚Äôt mean she can‚Äôt break the rules. But everyone else is supposed to follow them.\\" Stacy McKee, writer of season four episode \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\", which saw the establishment of Hahn as a main character, has deemed her: \\"hardcore. [...] a kick ass female surgeon\\". Smith has explained that the show's writers \\"didn‚Äôt want to rush to make [Hahn] likable, and hoped I didn‚Äôt mind. A lot of actors don‚Äôt want to be unlikable, even if they‚Äôre the bad guy. But I‚Äôm okay with that ‚Äî I‚Äôm good with being unlikable.\\" Series creator Shonda Rhimes, discussing the rivalry between Hahn and her Resident Cristina Yang ‚Äì which saw Hahn reprimanded by Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), Seattle Grace's Chief of Surgery, for her lack of encouragement ‚Äî has given the insight: \\"Hahn is a brilliant surgeon and is great with her patients but her teaching skills? Well, let's just say she can use a little more loving care with her students, particularly Cristina. [...] I felt sorry for Hahn because Hahn grew up in a surgical world that included even fewer women than there is now (so Hahn is accustomed to a \\"dog eat dog\\" kind of surgical world).\\" Trish Doolan, who consulted with the show's producers on the developing lesbian storyline between Hahn and Callie Torres, said of the character: \\"She's very strong, very good at what she does, and actually a lot of men are threatened by that. She's very confident with what she does and who she is\\". Initially upon her arrival at Seattle Grace, plastic surgeon Mark Sloan was seen to develop feelings for Hahn, only to be repeatedly rebuffed. The character explained that she kept her personal and professional lives separate, but as Smith has explained: \\"She came to the wrong hospital if she thought she wasn‚Äôt going to have a personal life!\\" Smith has admitted to eavesdropping on a writers‚Äô meeting in an attempt to find out what was in store for her character romantically, as it was being closely guarded, even from her. She discussed with TV Guide editor Michael Ausiello early in her tenure as Hahn how she and Sandra Oh had pushed for a lesbian relationship between Hahn and Cristina, having previously played lovers in the play Stop Kiss. She agreed with Ausiello's assessment that Hahn would make an \\"awesome lesbian\\" and that: \\"I've certainly let [the producers] know I'm open to it. [...] They were like, \\"OK, duly noted!\\" I think they wanted me to shut up already.\\" Equally, however, Smith has revealed that when she and Shonda Rhimes first discussed the possibility of Hahn being gay; \\"\\"we felt it was too obvious that a strong, powerful woman would be a lesbian\\". Despite this assessment, the end of the show's fourth season saw Hahn grow closer to orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres, in a relationship dubbed \\"Eri-Cal\\" and later \\"Callica\\" by Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes has stated that: \\"Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry. And watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show ‚Äî it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty.\\" She has explained that in developing the relationship between the two: \\"we wanted it to be real ‚Äì not some stunt to get people talking. We wanted to see what would happen if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman.\\" The two characters shared a kiss at the end of season finale, with which After Ellen have noted: \\"Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship.\\" Before embarking on the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; \\"They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship\\", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: \\"they didn't want to stereotype anything, either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of ‚Äî I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. And you could tell that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry.\\" Discussing her own reaction to the storyline, Smith has commented; \\"I was psyched. I thought it was a great idea.\\" She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; \\"a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something ‚Äî there was something, but I don't think it's ever ‚Äî I think it might be her first time.\\" Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; \\"I'll look at the script next week and be like \\"Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know.\\" She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: \\"It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before.\\" Following the announcement that Erica was being written out of Grey's Anatomy, Smith was asked whether she was happy with the direction the storyline had taken. She responded: \\"You know, I was starting to get there, yeah. I was personally a little impatient with the gay panic, but it was more Callie's thing anyway. I think Dr. Hahn was sort of figuring it out.\\" She deemed the scene which saw Callie sleep with Mark as practice for sleeping with Erica \\"a little icky\\", adding: \\"If you're a woman, don't you know how to please yourself?\\"  Reception  Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has praised the character highly, writing: \\"Hahn is a terrific character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She also seems to be a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don‚Äôt get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest- rated drama may be in your hands.)\\" Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: \\"The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and ‚Äî despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk ‚Äî a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships.\\" Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: \\"I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] [It] was more like a conquest, like he could have [Erica] too or something.\\" AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though \\"privileging the male gaze.\\" Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; \\"Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, \\"You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't.\\" So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, \\"Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out.\\" Following the announcement that the character had been written out of Grey's Anatomy, Mary Macnamara wrote a critical LA Times editorial on the decision. She deemed Smith's firing: \\"a grim reminder that certain prejudices are still ascendant in television\\", writing that \\"most gay characters are allowed to have sex on network television only if they are part of a single-episode story line, and all actively sexual lesbian characters must be sylphlike, gorgeous and preferably under 30.\\" She went on to assess that: \\"Smith probably got the boot not because her character wasn't interesting enough or sympathetic enough but because she, especially when paired with Ramirez, just didn't fit the visual template of \\"Grey's\\" or indeed, of most of network television. She is a character actress, not a tabloid star. In other words, and they are words I deeply regret, Ramirez, with all her lipglossed lusciousness, may be beautiful enough to be bi, but Smith is not beautiful enough to be gay. At least not on network TV. Some ground, it would appear, is too calcified to be broken.\\" After Ellen's Dorothy Snarker was similarly critical of the decision, explaining that: \\"Smith's dismissal means the loss of American broadcast TV's only lesbian/bisexual couple in primetime. It was also the first significant gay relationship portrayed on the hit ABC series. The handful of remaining lesbian/bisexual relationships on TV are on cable, premium channels and daytime television.\\" Detailing the decision to also change a new character's orientation from bisexual to heterosexual, Snarker added: \\"Besides striking a serious blow for queer women's visibility on the small screen, the moves seem to signal a significant setback in the industry's acceptance of mainstream gay and lesbian storylines.\\" She concluded that: \\"While Callie had fleeting moments of gay panic where she slept with friend and fellow surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the interaction between the two women was both organic and romantic. Callie and Erica's relationship stood out as one of the few bright spots for lesbian and bisexual characters on primetime TV. Now it seems all we‚Äôre left with is taillights.\\"  References  Specific General *  External links  *Grey's Anatomy at ABC.com Category:Grey's Anatomy characters Category:Fictional lesbians Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Television characters introduced in 2006 Category:Fictional female doctors Category:Fictional cardiothoracic surgeons Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Erica Hahn"},{"id":"13919117","text":"The geology of Oklahoma is characterized by Carboniferous rocks in the east, Permian rocks in the center and towards the west, and a cover of Tertiary deposits in the panhandle to the west.

Federal Signal Modulators (also known as Modulator Speaker Arrays) are electronic warning devices produced by Federal Signal Corporation that are used to alert the public about tornadoes, severe weather, earthquakes, fires, lahars or any other disaster. They are identified mostly by their distinctive stacked \\"flying saucer\\" design. The Modulator II is sold based on the more compact chassis of the siren compared to the original Modulators. General description The modulator is composed of speaker cells (ranging from two to eight with the exception of seven) that contain four speaker drivers per cell, although two models (model 6032 and 6048) had additional drivers available when they were still available. Modulators have an inactive (dummy) speaker cell on the bottom of the stack that is used to help project sound in all directions. Without the inactive cell, because of the design of active cells, there would be unbalanced sound distribution. Modulators that are being made now use the UltraVoice controller. When they were first made, they were used with Modulator Control Plus and basic/standard Modulator Controls. Models Modulator model numbers identify the number of cells, as well as the number of drivers. The first family of modulator arrays consisted of eight different models, as follows: 1004, 2008, 3012, 4016, 5020, 6024, 6032, and 6048. In January 2013, Federal Signal released the Modulator II sirens, consisting of the 1004B, 2008B, 3012B, 4016B, 5020B, 6024B, and 8032B. They provide the same alerting technology as the original modulator with the exception of a smaller compact chassis and cylindrical modules instead of elliptical ones. Warning tones Like Federal Signal's previous Electronic Outdoor Warning Siren series, the modulator can produce seven standard warning tones. The seven standard tones are: Wail, Alternate Wail, Pulsed Wail, Steady, Alternate Steady, Pulsed Steady and Westminster Chimes. If properly equipped, the modulator can also employ voice notification to give specific information or to give a more clear understanding of an emergency situation. They have also been known to play Star Spangled Banner during tests on or near the 4th July, and also on military bases that have the sirens there. The sirens can be activated by radio using single tone, two-tone, DTMF, MSK or POCSAG over analog, digital and trunking systems, or by satellite, cellular, landline or IP. They are also capable of being activated automatically by the Emergency Alert System. Similar devices The modulator has a similar setup to the Whelen WPS 2700, 2800, 2900, and OmniAlert omnidirectional speaker arrays. The Whelen arrays have single driver cells,Whelen Engineering Company: http://www.whelen.com/_MASSNOTIFICATION/omnisirn.php while modulators have multi-driver cells. Another siren that is similar to the modulator is the American Signal I-Force siren, which uses stacked, elliptical speaker cells that provide omnidirectional sound output, just like the modulator. Notable locations The modulators in Chicago's siren system run on the noticeably different and somewhat off-putting Alternate Wail tone during tornado warnings, often mistaken for being broken. Recordings of the siren have been uploaded to YouTube, with the videos reaching millions of views. Many people refer the Modulator as the \\"Chicago Siren\\", \\"Scary Tornado Siren\\" and \\"Siren Head\\" due to the unsettling nature of the tone. However, in O'Hare International Airport, their systems are different. Instead of using the main UV Wail or Attack, they use an Eclipse 8 (possibly) sound card doing attack. Before that is the Westminster Chimes. Moore, Oklahoma is well known for their modulators being placed close together compared to other cities. They are placed only a half-mile from each other in some parts of the city. Until 2017, some sirens ran on a major third dual-tone alert. Baytown, Texas is one of only a few cities in the United States to have a whole system of modulators. They use just over 20 5020's and 5020B's, and use them primarily for chemical releases. The modulators in Olmsted County, Minnesota are known for their pre- test and post-test voice announcements, and also for only being located in parks. The modulators in Monroe County, Michigan are known for their pre-test voice announcements. There is a unique \\"rainbow\\" modulator located in Monroe County as well. Eden Prairie, Minnesota has a uniquely mounted Modulator 5020 on top of a parking garage which has a custom attack tone that cannot be found on other modulators. This modulator has never done a voice announcement, which is one of the primary reasons that some cities invest in them. Additionally, in Cape Town, South Africa, several modulator sirens are installed which use their standard wail tone to alert citizens in the Melkbosstrand (of which Van Riebeeckstrand is part of), Duynefontein, Blaauwberg (of which Bloubergrant, West Beach, Blouberg Sands, and Sunningdale are part of), Table View, Robben Island, Atlantis, Philadelphia and Parklands areas in case of any emergency which can occur at the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station. These modulators are tested for about an hour annually on the first Wednesday of March during a so- called \\"Full Volume Siren Test\\" using a preset female voice (which reads \\"This is only a test; there is no need to take any action. This is only a test; there is no need to take any action. I repeat: this is only a test; there is no need to take any action. Listen to Good Hope FM or Kfm for further information\\") and live voice announcements (which are read by people and are often cite similar things said by the preset voice), other than the typical wail tone of the modulator. The Modulators (MOD-2008) make up nearly all the warning sirens in the Netherlands, which are tested on the first Monday of the month at noon.

Discovered in 1810 by P√©ron and Lesueur, A. forskalea was initially found in coastal to offshore waters of the Mediterranean Sea. This species is commonly referred to as the many-ribbed jellyfish. The species is often mixed up with some other members of the genus due to some similarities including the capability of bioluminescence.  Description  During the medusa stage of the life cycle, members of the A. forskalea species have large umbrellas which are thick near the center but gradually thin as they reach the margin of the umbrella. The stomach takes up roughly half of the overall width of the disc. Typically, this species has between 60-80 radial canals; however, individuals have been identified as A. forskalea with even fewer or as many as 160 canals. The gonads of this species run throughout nearly the entire width of this hydrozoan. The number of tentacles is usually fewer than the amount of radial canals per individual, but findings have shown that this can vary from half as many to twice as many. The umbrella for this species may span up to 175 mm across. There are small bulbs scattered around the marginal region while bulbs on the tentacles are conical and elongated. Also, A. forskalea has excretory pores on short papillae and between 5-10 statocysts between neighboring radial canals. Despite containing a bioluminescent protein, aequorin, this species (as well as all other species in the genus) are almost completely colorless.Mills, C.E. 1999-present. Bioluminescence of Aequorea, a hydromedusa. Electronic internet document available at https://faculty.washington.edu/cemills/Aequorea.html#anchor749954. Published by the author, web page established June 1999, last updated 11 January 2009.  Identification  Aequorea forskalea is synonymous with many different findings from 1775-1938. Even though it may have only been called A. forskalea in 1810, it was still discovered in 1775 as Aequorea aequorea. A reputable marine biologist, Frederick Stratten Russell, authored the book The Medusae of the British Isles in 1953 where he stated that A. forskalea was the acceptable name for these species, and that A. aequorea was a name reserved for an unidentifiable species. One notably similar species, A. victoria is found abundantly in the Pacific. In 1980, these two very similar species were differentiated by location‚ÄîA. victoria was accepted as the variant in the Pacific while A. forskalea was designated for the variants of the Atlantic and Mediterranean.  Distribution  While this pelagic species was originally discovered in offshore waters of the Mediterranean Sea, A. forskalea has been found in various suitable temperate and subtropical areas. This species is widely distributed, as they have been found in the Southwest Atlantic near northern Patagonia, along the west coast of Southern Africa, and from Galician waters stretching through the North Sea and up to the Norwegian Sea. Typically, this species is found in mid-continental shelf areas deeper than 150 meters; however, there have been cases of blooms occurring in coastal regions as shallow as 100 meters. This species is often found in waters measuring 13 ¬∞C to 22 ¬∞C (55.4 ¬∞F to 71.6 ¬∞F).  Bioluminescence  Species of the genus Aequorea contain a bioluminescent protein (aequorin) and GFP (green fluorescent protein) discovered and studied extensively by Dr. Osamu Shimomura in 1961. While this initial research was done primarily with Aequorea victoria, further studies have identified, analyzed, and extracted aequorin and GFP from various Aequorea species including A. forskalea. To this day, A. victoria is still the primary species-of-interest for these extractions.

Berton. The film's plot is similar to that of the Stephen King short story \\"The Monkey\\", leading some to believe that the filmmakers plagiarized the story. Plot An elderly woman, Elmira Johnson, uses a Ouija board to communicate with a dead spirit. When a spirit becomes angry, it manifests itself into a cymbal-banging monkey toy. The monkey's eyes glow red and uses its cymbals to cause lightning to strike the old woman's house, presumably killing her. Some time later, David Andrews, a suburban single father, celebrates his young son Michael's ninth birthday. The child receives the monkey from David's girlfriend Susan, who purchased it at an antiques store. The monkey strikes its cymbals on its own accord. Soon after the party, David awakens screaming from a nightmare in which he found Michael dead in the bathtub. After the household plants die, and the family's dog mysteriously dies from smoke inhalation after a fire in their garage, David suspects the monkey of being behind the events. David hires Adrienne, a fortune teller, to perform an exorcism on his home, but does not inform her about the monkey. Adrienne asks him if he has any statues or idols, explaining that demons often possess objects that are seemingly harmless, but use them as an outlet for their satanic activity. David realizes that the monkey is such an item, and is certain that a demon is in their home. He wants Adrienne to come and do an exorcism immediately. She tells him that she would need to find out more about his situation before she can intervene. She tells him that if it is a demon, she may not be able to help. David returns to the antiques store and the clerk tells him an odd man brought it to the store the previous week after finding it in the ruins of the old woman's house; the monkey showed no signs of fire damage, causing the clerk to disbelieve the story. Despite this, the clerk tells David about Elmira Johnson's recent death by fire. David doesn't think anything of this. When he arrives home, he finds that Susan has become possessed by the monkey and is trying to drown Michael in the bathtub. He grabs Susan and throws her out of his home, which causes her to sustain a head injury. A neighbor witnesses the incident and calls an ambulance. David decides to tell Adrienne about the monkey. She tells him she may be able to help. However, she tells him that when a demon is in contact with one who can see into the future and talk to ghosts, it goes crazy, and that \\"all hell would break loose\\" if she stepped foot in his home. She gives him a special necklace that will protect him from the demon as long as he keeps it in on him at all times. She tells him that he must get rid of the monkey immediately. The boy's father throws the monkey away, but his son quickly rescues it from the garbage and brings it back inside the house. Moments afterwards, Michael is almost hit by a car while playing in the driveway. David then takes the monkey and attempts to bury it but it finds its way into the house again thanks to his mother. The monkey then winds up causing the violent deaths of the boy and his family by blowing up the house from inside.  Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders  In 1996, Berton re-edited the film as the second story of Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders, a horror/fantasy anthology film aimed at children (unlike the adult rated original film.) In addition to removing the more violent sequences of the original, other subplots are missing and Adrienne only appears in a single scene. The entire plotline in which Susan is possessed by the demon is missing, leading to her suddenly vanishing from the film. The Merlin version also integrates that film's framing device, showing Merlin trying to track down the toy monkey (an artifact stolen from his shop) in several interludes. This also leads to the addition of a happy ending in which Merlin arrives at the last moment and stops the monkey from blowing up the house. Dubbing added in the production of that film confirms the survival of the family in this version.

(1997). Alternative silvicultural approaches to timber harvesting: Variable retention harvest systems. In textbook: Creating a Forestry for the 21st Century: The Science of Ecosystem Management. (eds K.A. Kohn & J.F. Franklin), pp. 111. Island Press, Washington, D.C. Some examples for environmental values are forest cover connectivity, soil stabilization, microclimate under retained trees, habitats associated with live or dead trees and species diversity due to habitat preservation, and wildlife corridor preservation. Variable retention also aids in emulation of natural disturbances by leaving behind some residual structure from previous stand which is typical for stand replacing disturbances Traditional silviculture systems such as clearcut, patch cut, shelterwood, etc. are focused on maximizing timber production and future regeneration of the trees. Variable retention on the other hand is focused on what is retained  Value of variable retention  Variable retention is gradually becoming a popularly promoted tool for helping resolve the dilemma between demands for wood and demands to maintain habitat and ecology biodiversity and structural diversity in managed forests. What is at issue is how much a forest operation can log without adversely interfering with other ecological processes within the forest. Variable retention minimizes the impact of logging operation by leaving biological legacies such as coarse woody debris (nurse logs and snags). Either few trees or many trees can be retained under the variable retention system, and trees can be retained in patches (aggregated retention) or left uniformly throughout a stand (dispersed retention); hence the name \\"variable retention.\\" It is a technique for retaining trees as key structural elements of a harvested stand for at least until next harvest rotation in an effort to maintain species, habitat diversity and forest-related processes. A 2014 meta-analysis of retention forestry research found \\"support for wider use of retention forestry since it moderates negative harvesting impacts on biodiversity.\\" There are four key mechanisms through which variable retention is presumed to maintain biodiversity: * By providing a constant supply of structural features that are at high risk to being lost due to modern forestry practices and that are known to be important to habitat availability, such as large trees, very young trees, snags, and coarse woody debris * By providing adequate refuge for sensitive species that will colonize the surrounding managed forest environment as it develops suitable conditions * By establishing habitat patches, Patch dynamics, that can serve as stepping stones for the dispersal of newly produced offspring, seeds, and spores * By increasing the structural diversity of managed stands  Variable retention - Harvesting methods  The method of variable retention is a more deliberate process than clearcutting. In some cases helicopters take the logs out. The use of the helicopters avoid the need to build logging roads inside the forest and hence avoid the disturbance of the forest floor. Yet, helicopter logging is less fuel efficient than truck use. Some logging operations that use variable retention try to emulate forest disturbances. In those cases, deadwood in snags and logs is left behind. Such dead or dying trees provide a growth medium for fungi and epiphytes, as well as food and shelter for insects and the birds. Loggers also leave younger trees that will continue to grow. Variable retention harvesting retains more than 15% of the original stand in both rolling and permanent pockets of untouched trees and refugia patches. Retained forest structure is composed of live and dead trees that enhance structural diversity, and provide a hospitable habitat for variety of living organisms that prevail in the unlogged forest. This silviculture regime provides post-harvest ecological structure while creating sufficient opportunity to plant and naturally regenerate valuable tree species for timber, as well as restore historical coniferous and/or deciduous tree dominance to the forestland. Some timber companies have restricted the use of variable retention silviculture to only poorly stocked stands of rare but valuable tree species.  Controversy  Ecologists regard the variable retention method of harvesting as being far less detrimental to the forest ecosystem than clearcutting. However, opponents claim that variable retention is much more laborious, tedious, time-consuming and expensive than clearcutting. A review of studies in British Columbia and in similar forest types indicates that while both aggregated and dispersed retention can contribute to biodiversity conservation there may be some negative consequences for timber production such as wind damage to retained trees and reduced growth rates of tree regeneration compared to clearcuts, concluding in favour of an adaptive management approach for balancing competing objectives of production of wood and biodiversity conservation. Forestry organizations, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), approve of variable retention and are now declaring timber obtained through such a harvesting method as certified wood for green building. Many forest operations in the Canadian province of British Columbia, including MacMillan Bloedel, use the variable retention method to harvest timber in the temperate rain forests along the Pacific coast. Many logging companies have not maintained a total commitment to phasing out clearcutting and embracing variable retention harvesting, and even MacMillan Bloedel had occasionally fallen short of its commitment to phase out clearcutting. Although world markets are beginning to ask for certified wood obtained entirely through variable retention harvesting, it is not yet clear whether the general population of consumers will be willing to pay higher prices for such wood.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, With its 50,000 watt AM signal, CKLW covered Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Illinois, as well as southwestern Ontario, Cleveland and Toledo. In the early 1970s, the station had one of the largest cumulative audiences in North America. In the 1970s, the CRTC mandated that radio stations follow Canadian Content rules and play a certain percentage of Canadian music. Trombley picked the Canadian records she felt stood the best chance of becoming hits for airplay. In some cases, listener response to the Canadian records the station featured led to an American single release, and occasionally a national hit,\\"The Legacy of Rosalie Trombley, Radio Pioneer Immortalized in Bob Seger's 'Rosalie' and Breaker of 'Bennie and the Jets'\\". Billboard, 1/21/2016 by Karen Bliss as in the case of the Skylark song \\"Wildflower\\", playing it for over three months as an album cut before its release as a single. Another example is The Carpenters' 1977 cover of Canadian band Klaatu's \\"Calling Occupants Of Interplanetary Craft\\". With so much Canadian content, the station's American popularity began to fade. Trombley acknowledged in a 1982 Billboard magazine article that her station no longer had the \\"clout\\" it once did; but despite that, CKLW continued to play a role in breaking hits.\\"Rosalie Trombley: Record Breaker, Hit Maker.\\" Billboard, August 7, 1982, p. CKLW-2. Trombley served as Music Director of CKLW from 1968‚Äì84, through the station's top 40 years and into the era when CKLW changed format to appeal to an older audience. After leaving the station, she worked at WLTI-FM in Detroit and then CKEY in Toronto.Harry Van Vugt. \\"CBE Radio's Les Mather Suspended.\\" Windsor Star, December 16, 1988, p. C8. Influence Many recording artists visited Trombley to promote their latest single releases, and the walls of her office were lined with gold records. Among the artists she is credited with helping are Earth, Wind and Fire; Elton John; Kiss; Ted Nugent; The Guess Who, The Poppy Family and Bob Seger.\\"Rosalie Trombley, Hall of Fame Contender.\\" Windsor Star, June 23, 2011, p.

She persuaded Elton John to release \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" as a single, because she believed, correctly, that it would be a cross-over hit, appealing to both black and white listeners.Joe Fox. \\"Motown and Murder a Potent Mix for the Big 8.\\" Toronto Star, December 17, 2005, p. H9. Trombley was immortalized by Bob Seger in his 1973 song \\"Rosalie\\", which appeared on the Back in '72 album (\\"She's got the tower, she's got the power / Rosalie\\"). (The song was later covered by Irish band Thin Lizzy, on their 1975 album Fighting and again on their 1978 LP Live and Dangerous.) Seger wrote it in frustration at not being able to get his songs played on CKLW at that time.Bill Gray. \\"Seger's On the Verge of Breakthrough.\\" Detroit News, December 13, 2006. There are differing stories concerning Trombley‚Äôs reaction to the tune: some claim she hated ‚ÄúRosalie‚Äù and refused to allow her DJs to play it; others insist the programmer was flattered, but worried about a potential conflict of interest. Either way, CKLW never played \\"Rosalie\\", although the song did receive spins on other Detroit stations, as well as top-40 outlets as far away as Idaho. Legacy Trombley has granted interviews only occasionally, including for the 1971 WDRQ documentary The History of Detroit Radio and for the 2004 documentary Radio Revolution: The Rise and Fall of the Big 8, produced by Toronto-based Markham Films. Much of the documentary was about her contributions and influence. The film's co-producer Eugene McNamara noted that unlike others who worked at CKLW, she did not go on to additional successes after her years at the Big 8. \\"I think it was because she was a woman in a male-dominated environment,\\" McNamara stated. In April 1992, Trombley was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the first annual Motor City Music Awards, held in Detroit.\\"Radi-O-Rama.\\" Gavin Report, April 17, 1992, p. 7. The \\"Rosalie Trombley Award\\" honours women who have made their mark in broadcasting, and is presented during Canadian Music Week. Trombley was inducted into the Motor City (Detroit) Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Canadian Music Week Broadcaster's Hall of Fame. She is now retired and living in Windsor, Ontario. On June 14, 2011, a scholarship in Trombley's name was announced by St. Clair College, for their Music Theatre Performance program. On June 16 of that same year, Rosalie received an honorary diploma from the Music Theatre Performance program.

Likkutei Sichos covers a range of topics including ideas in Jewish philosophy and theology, biblical and Talmudic commentary on biblical, kabbalistic expositions, moral and practical directives, and perspectives on world events.Likuttei Sichos. Chabad.org. Accessed May 7, 2014. The essays were transcribed from the public talks given by Rabbi Schneerson and are compiled in over three dozen volumes, arranged by the weekly Torah portion and special occasions in the Jewish and Hasidic calendar.Likkutei Sichos Set - 39 volumes. Kehot Publication Society. Accessed April 30, 2014. Likkutei Sichos contains both the scope and the core of the Lubavitcher Rebbe‚Äôs teachings, and is the most authoritative sorce text for the Rebbe's unique, original, and often revolutionary explanation of Judaism. Rabbi Schneerson's primary vehicle for conveying his teachings were the farbrengens held on Shabbat, the festivals, and special occasions in the Chabad Lubavitch calendar, at which he would speak for many hours. Of the many of thousands of talks that Schneerson delivered, those that were the most basic to his weltanschauung and message were compiled in the Likkutei Sichot, which originally appeared in weekly pamphlets. He reviewed and extensively edited each of these transcriptions before it went to press, making the Likkutei Sichot the authoritative medium with which to disseminate his teachings. The volumes of Likkutei Sichos are published by the Lubavitch Publication House Kehot Publication Society. The edited Sichos represent much of Schneerson's central teachings, and unique spiritual voice for the generation, with other major works being the deeper, mystical Maamarim (Hasidic discourses), unedited talks, personal correspondence etc. The nature of his leadership and thought marks a culminating fulfillment of Hasidic history, representing the fullest measure of the Hasidic ideal to disseminate the \\"wellsprings\\" of Chassidus in the widest and most accessible forms, and united with the other dimensions of Judaism. The many aspects of Likkutei Sichos present the most accessible form of the Rebbe's thought, and its practical application. Contents Some of the volumes of Likkutei Sichos are devoted to explaining mystical Hasidic philosophy, as it explains the weekly portion of Torah, Jewish festivals, or other ideas drawn from all aspects of traditional Jewish thought. Other talks are devoted to elucidating the \\"Revealed\\" dimensions of Judaism, such as Talmudic commentary. In this category are the celebrated \\"Rashi Sichos\\" and the Hadranim talks given on the completion of learning cycles. \\"Rashi Sichos\\" In 1964 the Lubavitcher Rebbe began his delivery of some 800 public talks over a period of over 25 years on the subject of Rashi‚Äôs commentary to the Torah. The medieval French Rabbi Rashi is among the most important traditional Jewish commentators on the books of the Torah, and the many volumes of Talmud. His commentary on the 5 Books of the Torah elucidates the simple meaning (p'shat), with some additional meanings from the Midrashic method, which initially appear to be utilised when the simple meaning still leaves questions. The essential nature of Rashi's explanations on the Torah has historically drawn many sub- commentaries from leading Rabbis, who explain why Rashi says what he does. It can be said that the Lubavitcher Rebbe's Rashi Sichos perhaps represent his personally most innovative contribution to Jewish thought, out of a complete mastery and innovative teaching in all areas of Judaism. In the Rashi Sichos, Schneerson brings a new approach, that initially cites all previous sub- commentaries from earlier authorities, and then proceeds to explain why each of them falls short. Often these earlier explanations rely on Talmudic thought. He elucidates a deceptively simple explanation of Rashi that he often culminates by additionally relating his conclusions to their spiritual, mystical parallels, and practical outcomes. In each talk, the Rebbe would offer a novel interpretation of one of Rashi‚Äôs comments, based on principles which Rashi had apparently followed when writing his entire commentary. Each lecture of the Rebbe built on the previous one, gradually assembling a picture of Rashi‚Äôs commentary as an extremely organized, unified system of Torah exegesis. Many who were present at these lectures at their inception in the late sixties and early seventies, recall how the ‚ÄúRashi talk‚Äù was literally the highlight of the entire Sabbath afternoon gathering. While all of the talks were published immediately in transcript form (almost word for word), many hundreds of them underwent a thorough review by the Rebbe who re-analyzed the arguments according to strict academic criteria and reconstructed the talk as a scholarly paper, supported by numerous footnotes. According to the testimony of one of his personal assistants, the Rebbe would often dedicate as much as 18 hours a week to this task. Style It can be said that in all of Schneerson's many-dimensional scholarship, he captures the simple essence of Hasidic mysticism, and unites it with the Revealed aspects of Judaism, always seeking to bring ideas into greatest tangibility, and above all practical outcomes (\\"The main thing is the deed\\"). This reflects the essential meaning of Hasidism, which uncovers the inner spiritual meaning of Kabbalah, and seeks to bring this Divine essence down to the lowest levels. The talks represent this, as in contrast to the Maamarim (Hasidic discourses), the historically more traditional vehicle for Hasidic mysticism, in the informal Sichos (Talks), the Rebbe tends to avoid deep Kabbalistic terminology. The talks bring Hasidic thought into everyday language. This represents a culminating stage to the historical development of Hasidic thought.  Publication  Likkutei Sichos was published by (the Vaad Lhafotzas Sichos through) the main Chabad publishing house, Kehot Publication Society. The work is organized according to the weekly Torah reading (Parshah) and the Jewish calendar. Likkutei Sichos is an anthology of Rabbi Schneerson's public talks; the speeches were transcribed by redactors (meinichim) prior to publication. These redactors also served as \\"choizrim\\" in the event the talk could not be recorded electronically or (such as on Shabbat and festivals when writing and recording is forbidden under Jewish law). The redactors' transcripts were then submitted to Rabbi Schneerson for editing prior to publishing. Farbrengens were sometimes delivered on weekdays in order to mark occasions like Chasidic festivals. These were at first available directly around the world by phone- link, and in later years, broadcast across America on live television channels. They were then put in writing, like the talks delivered on Shabbos. After being edited personally by Schneerson, they were distributed in booklet form worldwide. They were later compiled into books, of which there is a set of 39 volumes. Vols. 1-9 are in Yiddish; vols. 10-14, in Hebrew; vols. 15-29 are in Yiddish; and vols. 30-39, in Hebrew. In particular, Reb Yoel Kahn is noteworthy for having prepared the first nine volumes of Likkutei Sichos. Other talks were released as unedited talks, and included in the series Toras Menachem - Hisva'aduyos (Lahak Hanochos,1982 and on) and the series Sichos Kodesh (various publishers). =English editions= Likkutei Sichos was first translated into the English language in 1979. The work received editorial input from Rabbi Menachem Mendel. The translated work is currently published by the Sichos in English publishing house and is translated by Eliyahu Touger.In English: Likutei or Likkutei Sichos?. ChabadInfo.com. Accessed April 30, 2014. A single volume of collected talks in English was written by Rabbi Dr. Jonathan Sacks, former Chief Rabbi of England. The volume is titled Torah Studies.Sacks, Jonothan. Torah Studies. Chabad.org. Accessed May 7, 2014. An English Translation of selected \\"Rashi Sichos\\" was published by Kehot Publication Society, titled \\"Studies In Rashi\\". As of now, three volumes have been published. Further reading * In English the first four volumes of Likkutei Sichos have been translated and published by Kehot, though they presently appear to be out of print. There are many English books, available through Kehot, that summarise main ideas and discussions from Likkutei Sichos, but often the great qualities of the many threads of thought are diminished thereby, although these compilations can gain in accessibility and application. For alternative compilations drawn from the Sichos, see the English section of Kehot Publication Society online, under the heading of Rebbes: The Lubavitcher Rebbe (seventh Rebbe). Some of the many works on this list are drawn from Likkutei Sichos. * For those seeking a scholarly investigation of the nature of Schneerson's talks, a doctoral thesis is presented on them, originally published by Jason Aronson (now subsumed into Rowman & Littlefield publishers) as \\"The Educational Teachings of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson\\", by Aryeh Solomon (and Louis David Solomon). * Sichos are contrasted with the deeper mystical format of the Maamarim (Chassidic discourses) that utilise more Kabbalistic terminology. An accessible example of them is published by Kehot Publication Society as \\"Basi LeGani: Chassidic Discourses\\" (translated into English by Eliyahu Touger). This contains the last discourse of the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe from 1950, and the first discourse of the 7th Rebbe from 1951, with which he assumed leadership. Both begin with the quotation from the Biblical Song of Songs \\"Basi legani..\\" (\\"I [have] come into My garden..\\"). The last discourse of the sixth Rebbe is seen by his successor to allude to his message for the subsequent generation. The first discourse of the seventh Rebbe directly addresses the spiritual meaning and task of our generation.

She represented the electoral district of Halton in the House of Commons of Canada from 1953 until her death. Biography Bennett's parents were from one of the oldest families to have settled in Halton County, being of United Empire Loyalist origin from Massachusetts. She was also a second cousin to R.B. Bennett. She obtained degrees from the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall, where she took active part in political debates. Bennett was called to the bar in 1930, and, in 1945, became the fourth woman in the British Commonwealth to be named as a King's Counsel. She was one of the first women in Canada to enter private practice in law, setting up in partnership in Brampton and later opening a law office in Georgetown. She had the reputation of being a gifted orator. A member of the Progressive Conservative Party, Bennett first ran for election in the 1949 election, but was defeated by Liberal incumbent Hughes Cleaver. Cleaver did not run again in 1953, and Bennett won the riding over new Liberal candidate Murray McPhail. On becoming an MP, she sat in the same seat in the chamber that her cousin once had. Along with Margaret Aitken, Ellen Fairclough and Ann Shipley, she was one of four women elected to the House of Commons in 1953, only the second election in Canadian history in which more than one woman was elected to Parliament. Bennett died at her home on November 12, 1956, being the first female MP in Canada ever to do so in office. She died just four days after her law partner LeRoy Dale, with whom she had been in partnership since 1936. No by-election was held following her death; she was succeeded by Charles Alexander Best in the 1957 election.

Christian tradition states that he had two siblings, named Valentine (Valent√≠n) and Engratia (Engracia). They all lived as hermits on a mountain in the region of Sep√∫lveda.Patron Saints Index: Saint Fructos Engratia should not be confused with the 4th-century Portuguese martyr of the same name. Born in the 7th century to a noble family of Segovia, Fructus and his two siblings sold their family possessions after their parents' death and gave the earnings to poor. Wishing to escape from the city and the turbulent times, they established themselves on the rocky terrain near the village of Sepulveda now known as the Hoces del Durat√≥n, where they lived apart from one another in caves that ensured them complete solitude.San Frutos, protector de los segovianos Tradition holds that Valentine and Engratia were later martyred around 715 by advancing Moorish forces, and that Fructus died of natural causes in the same year at the age of 73.Asociaci√≥n Cultural Villaseca (PORTAL) Legends A legend states that some locals, wishing to join Fructus in his retreat to his death, traveled there, only to be pursued by Moorish forces to the very door of Fructus‚Äô hermitage. Fructus attempted to convert the Muslim soldiers, but without success. The legend goes on to state that Fructus drew a line across the earth, asking that the Moorish forces not cross it. When they ignored him and attempted to cross, the earth miraculously opened up to swallow them up, at a crack in the rock now called La Cuchillada. From that point on, the Moors did not bother Fructus. Veneration They are venerated as the patron saints of Segovia, where their relics are enshrined and are recognized as saints of the Orthodox Patriarchate of Rome. Fructus, Valentine and Engratia are commemorated on 25 October by Western Rite Orthodox communities, and in the Roman Catholic Church. Their relics were conserved in the hermitage of San Frutos from the 8th century to the 11th, when they were translated to Segovia Cathedral. The area of Fructus' hermitage suffered various political and military vicissitudes; this area was conquered by Fern√°n Gonz√°lez before being annexed by Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir in 984. It fell to Christian control once again in 1011 through the efforts of Sancho Garc√≠a of Castile, and in 1076 was repopulated by Alfonso VI of Castile. By the 1070s, the Benedictines had established a church in honor of Saint Fructus in the area, as well as an adjoining monastery. On the night of October 24 is celebrated the procession in honor of Fructus known as the Paso de la Hoja (\\"Turn of the Page\\"). A sculpture of Fructus rests in a niche in this cathedral. This sculpture has Fructus holding a book; according to local legend, it is the ‚ÄúBook of Life‚Äù: when Fructus turns to the last page, the world will end. Fructus' feast day is celebrated with music and contests, and devotees also celebrate his feast day at the park of Hoces del R√≠o Durat√≥n, where they accompany a statue of Fructus.

With the demise of the canal system in the early 20th century, usage of the lake shifted to recreation. History As early as the 1750s, the area that would become Buckeye Lake was described as a great swamp known as \\"Buffalo Lick\\". The main Indian trails between the Ohio River and the Miami towns passed by this swamp. Construction of a dike to block the South Fork of the Licking River occurred between 1826 and 1830, to provide a source of water for the Ohio and Erie Canal. In 1894, the Ohio State Legislature changed the reservoir's name to \\"Buckeye Lake\\". An amusement park and other recreation- oriented business developed, thrived and eventually declined as the 20th century proceeded. In 1949 Buckeye Lake was named a state park. Much of the area around the lake came to be used for vacation or permanent residences. In March 2015, the Huntington District of the Army Corps of Engineers were paid $140,000 to release a structural inspection review, which identified numerous weaknesses in the lake's dam and warned that the lake was in imminent danger of a dam failure. Corps officials proposed a range of possible solutions, including doing nothing, completely replacing the dam or entirely draining the lake. As a result of the recommendation, Gov. John Kasich approved $150 million in funding to secure the dam. The dam was restored within three years and under budget at $107 million; a ribbon cutting ceremony was held on November 8, 2018.

It is sometimes referred to as the Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province or Emeishan Flood Basalts. Like other volcanic provinces or \\"traps\\", the Emeishan Traps are multiple layers of igneous rock laid down by large mantle plume volcanic eruptions. The Emeishan Traps eruptions were serious enough to have global ecological and paleontological impact. It is named for Emeishan, a mountain in Sichuan. Etymology The term \\"trap\\" has been used in geology since 1785‚Äì1795 for such rock formations. It is derived from the Swedish word for stairs (\\"trappa\\") and refers to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.Trap at dictionary.reference.com Formation and development The eruptions that produced the Emeishan Traps began 265 million years ago (Ma) or earlier. The main eruptive period is between 262 and 261 Ma, and the volcanism activities end 259 Ma. In volume, the Emeishan Traps are dwarfed by the massive Siberian Traps, which occurred, in terms of the geological time scale, not long after, at approximately 252 Ma. The Emeishan basalts covers an area of more than 250,000 km2 with thicknesses ranging from several hundred meters up to 5.5 km (the average flood basalt thickness throughout the entire region is estimated to be around 700 m), but the Emeishan traps may have initially covered an area as much as 500,000 km2. Thus the entire volume of the Emeishan basalts is estimated to be 300,000 km3. Evidence suggests that the initial volcanism of the central Emeishan Traps occurred in a deep submarine environment without any significant prevolcanic uplift. The Emeishan Traps are associated with the end-Guadalupian extinction or end-Capitanian extinction event, the extinction of animal and plant life that occurred at the end of the Capitanian stage of the Guadalupian epoch of the Permian period. Limestone within the traps show the extinction to occur immediately below the first eruptive unit, with the mass extinction marked at the onset of explosive Emeishan volcanism. The formation of volcaniclastics suggest violent phreatomagmatic-style eruptions. The synchrony between the Emeishan Traps and the end-Guadalupian extinction has been taken to support the argument of Vincent Courtillot and others, that volcanism is the main driver of mass extinctions.

Organization Theater J is housed in the Washington, D.C. Jewish Community Center (DCJCC). Hailed by The New York Times as ‚ÄúThe Premier Theater for Premieres,‚Äù and recipient of 61 Helen Hayes nominations and awards, Theater J has emerged as one of the most distinctive, progressive and respected Jewish theaters on the national and international scene. A program of the Washington DC Jewish Community Center, Theater J performs in the Aaron & Cecile Goldman Theater, part of the Washington, D.C. Jewish Community Center's Morris Cafritz Center for the Arts in D.C.'s Dupont Circle neighborhood. Founding Artistic Director is Martin Blank (1990-1993). In December 2014, Ari Roth, Theater J's artistic director of 18 years, was fired after a series of widely publicized disagreements between Roth and his superior, the executive director of the Washington DCJCC. Between January 2014-November 2015 Shirley Serotsky (who previously served as Associate Artistic Director) served as Theater J's Acting Artistic Director. Adam Immerwahr will serve as Theater J's new Artistic Director, beginning December 2015. Performing in the 240-seat Aaron & Cecile Goldman Theater in the vibrant Dupont Circle neighborhood, Theater J works with some of the world‚Äôs most distinguished authors for the stage. It has produced world premieres by Thomas Keneally, Robert Brustein, Wendy Wasserstein, Joyce Carol Oates and Ariel Dorfman, with many debuts from emerging writers like Anna Ziegler, Sam Forman and Renee Calarco. Theater J‚Äôs diverse body of work also includes the ongoing initiative: Locally Grown: Community Supported Art Festival, which supports the development of new plays by local playwrights. It has been called out by The Washington Post as ‚Äúsimply one of the most important and worthwhile projects that any local theater has adopted.\\" With hit productions including Talley‚Äôs Folly, The Disputation, Honey Brown Eyes, The Chosen (a Theater J production presented by Arena Stage at the Mead Center for American Theater), New Jerusalem, After the Fall, Our Class, Race and Freud's Last Session, it's no surprise that The Washington Post proclaims that ‚ÄúTheater J propels itself to a new level of engagement with its audience, and, perhaps, to the forefront of theaters exposing Americans to drama that stirs the conscience as it illuminates aspects of Jewish culture.‚Äù Winner of the 2008 Mayor‚Äôs Arts Award for Excellence in an Artistic Discipline, Theater J also offers much more than just productions through Beyond the Stage, which includes readings; a wide array of post-show programming such as panel discussions, cast talkbacks, and our Passports Program which brings theater to area students and underserved adult populations. Plays thumb Since its establishment in 1990, Theater J has made new play development a critical pillar of its work. With over 40 world premiere productions, English language premieres, and second productions of newly revised plays, Theater J has made new work a key strategy for creating art that speaks to Jewish values and to the issues and concerns of the Washington D.C. community. In addition to producing new plays, each season Theater J conducts workshops and staged readings of plays in development in order to support playwrights in the creation of new plays. Theater J is proud of its rich working relationships with playwrights of distinction who treasure the highly professional, intimate, and supportive environment. Notable writers who have had new work premiered at Theater J include Robert Brustein (Spring Forward/Fall Back, 2006), Richard Greenberg (Bal Masque, 2006), Ariel Dorfman (Picasso‚Äôs Closet, 2006), Joyce Carol Oates (The Tattooed Girl, 2007), Mark Medoff (Tommy J and Sally, 2002), Wendy Wasserstein (Third and Welcome to my Rash) and Thomas Keneally (Either Or, 2007). Shows developed at Theater J often go on to receive follow-up productions across the country and artists with whom we have worked go on to make an impact on the theatrical world long after they leave DC. For example, Stefanie Zadravec‚Äôs Honey Brown Eyes, the 2009 Charles MacArthur Award for Outstanding New Play, was published in American Theatre Magazine. It has gone on to productions at The Working Theatre Off-Broadway and in smaller venues throughout the country. Theodore Bikel‚Äôs Sholom Aleichem: Laughter Through Tears, a one-man, three-musician musical which premiered at Theater J in 2008, went on to a successful run at the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene at Baruch Performing Arts Center in NY where Bikel was nominated for a 2010 Drama Desk Award for Solo Performance by an Actor. Subsequently, it has been produced in Los Angeles, Toronto, and toured throughout Eastern Europe. Most recently, Theater J‚Äôs Locally Grown: Community Supported Art Festival, a new play development initiative that commissions and then produces plays by local playwrights has been called ‚Äúquite simply one of the most important and worthwhile projects that any local theater has adopted, in the cause of making this a more hospitable city for playwriting talent‚Äù by The Washington Post. Playwrights who have participated in Locally Grown have seen their plays move on to be named Semi-Finalists for the Eugene O‚ÄôNeill Playwriting Conference, to Off-broadway productions, and readings or productions in Tennessee, Florida, Virginia and California. Additionally, Theater J has a long history of working with Israeli playwrights to develop the English-language premieres of their work, working with Boaz Goan on the English-language premiere of Boged (Traitor): An Enemy of the People, Hillel Milepunkt‚Äôs The Accident, Hadar Galron's Mikveh, with multiple premieres over the years from Motti Lerner (Passing The Love of Women, Pangs of The Messiah, Benedictus, and the workshop presentation of The Admission). Theater J also has a history of important second productions that bring plays to the attention of the theatrical world beyond their world-premieres, such as the production of Anna Ziegler‚Äôs Photograph 51, first produced by Active Cultures Theater in Maryland and which has now gone on to be produced by 10 different theaters. Other second productions that included significant revisions include Jacquelyn Reingold‚Äôs String Fever in 2005, Kate Fodor‚Äôs Hannah and Martin in 2005, Jennifer Maisel‚Äôs The Last Seder in 2003, The Mad Dancers by Yehuda Hyman in 2003, co-directed by Liz Lerman, The Argument by Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, and the upcoming 2016 production of Another Way Home by Anna Ziegler. Theater J has shown premieres by Richard Greenberg (Bal Masque), Ariel Dorfman (Picasso‚Äôs Closet), Joyce Carol Oates (The Tattooed Girl), Wendy Wasserstein (Third), Aaron Posner (Life Sucks), and Caleen Sinette Jennings (Queens Girl in the World). Critical response Theater J has been described by The New York Times as offering \\"professional polish, thoughtful dramaturgy and nervy experimentation,\\" and by Hadassah Magazine as \\"one of the most successful and avant-garde\\" of contemporary American Jewish theaters. The company is also known for its record of premiering new works. The New York Times called Theater J \\"The Premier Theater for Premieres.\\" Notes Theater J is a Blue Star Theatre, part of a collaboration between the Theatre Communications Group and Blue Star Families offering discounted admission to all military personnel, their families, and U.S. veterans.

Though Lac Seul First Nation is a treaty signatory to Treaty 3, the First Nation is a member of the Independent First Nations Alliance, a regional tribal council and a member of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation. The registered population of Lac Seul was 2,837 persons in April 2008, of which the on- reserve population was 774. The First Nation have the Lac Seul 28 Indian reserve, known as Obishikokaang in the Anishinaabe language, containing three settlements. Frenchmen's Head is accessible by road and is approximately from Sioux Lookout. Whitefish Bay is also newly accessible by road and is approximately from Sioux Lookout, Ontario. Kejick Bay is approximately northwest of Sioux Lookout and is accessible by road and water and air. Frenchmen's Head and Kejick Bay each have a population of about 400 each, while Whitefish Bay has a population of about 100. In 1929 Ontario Hydro constructed a dam at Ear Falls to control the level of the lake to produce hydroelectricity. The flooding from turning the lake into a reservoir caused the area known previously as Kejick Bay to become an island, permanently separating it from the mainland and splitting the community into two parts. The island portion retained the name Kejick Bay and the portion of the community on the mainland became Whitefish Bay. The Indian reserve is bordered on all sides by territory of the Unorganized Kenora District, except at its southeast, which borders the town of Sioux Lookout. Name The French name for the lake and the reserve, Lac Seul, may be a mistranslation of Obishikokaang as Obezhigokaang: \\"Sole Abundance\\". The meaning of Obishikokaang is not known but the typical translation of Obishikokaang provided is \\"Narrows [Abundant] with White Pine\\" or \\"White Pine Narrows\\", which in common Ojibwe should be something closer to Obaazhingwaakokaang. Governance The First Nation is governed by Chief Derek Maud and seven councillors: Elvis Trout, Chris Lawson, Raymond Angeconeb, Samantha Kejick, Gerald Kejick, Stan Littledeer, Emma Littledeer, and Wade Bull.

It covers Albuquerque and Valencia County. It is a non-commercial station owned by Educational Media Foundation broadcasting its \\"Air 1\\" Christian Worship music format. KQRI is one of the newest additions to the Albuquerque radio market, having moved into the area in 2004 from Grants, New Mexico. The 105.5 frequency in Albuquerque was previously translator K288CX, which had re- broadcast the programming on various stations in the Albuquerque and Santa Fe market over the years. In 2015, more than decade after being displaced, the translator moved to 107.5 as K298BY rebroadcasting KIVA 1600. In 2012, KQRI- FM1, a 16,000 watt effective radiated power booster on 105.5 in Albuquerque came on the air. 105.5 was originally KQLV and had aired EMF's \\"K-Love\\" format. In the spring of 2009, KQLV had moved to the recently upgraded facility at 90.7 FM Santa Fe. KQRI and the \\"Air 1\\" format had previously aired on 90.7 in Belen, which had moved to 91.1 to make way for the Santa Fe station on 90.7. KQRI moved to 105.5 in June 2009 while 91.1 became KQGC airing a Christian country music format. Since this change, KQRI is now vying for area listeners with locally programmed heritage station KLYT previously known as \\"M88\\". That station, however, had rebranded as \\"Static Radio\\" in 2011 playing Christian rock bands alongside some selected secular alternative rock songs. In April 2015 it rebranded again as \\"Star 88\\". On December 1, 2015, KQRI had been rebroadcasting on translator K233CG 94.5 in Albuquerque. The EMF owned translator had previously been leased since 2011 to KRKE 1550 (now KQNM) which aired an 80's hits format until late September 2015. KQRI had previously used the translator from 2009-2011 when it broadcast at 89.5 as K208EO although it did not really provide any additional coverage for KQRI. In late June 2016 EMF sold the translator to Martha Whitman for $61,432.66. Martha Whitman is the owner of KOAZ 1510 AM and translator K279BP which rebroadcasts KOAZ. The sale was consummated on August 15, 2016 at which time the broadcast on 94.5 ceased. The translator now airs programming from KKOB (AM). KDRI This format has also aired on KDRI out of Grants, New Mexico on 90.3 FM, which can sometimes be picked up in Albuquerque on some radios (usually in cars) although not so much since KANW upgraded K212AN in Santa Fe in late 2015. This station was previously KLGQ from 2005 until August 15, 2012 when it changed to KDRI. The station broadcasts at 1,000 watts. On June 13, 2016, this station went silent as EMF prepared to sell the station.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101733274&formid;=910&fac;_num=83874 On September 12, 2016, the station was donated along with KGGA 88.1 in Gallup to the Board of Education of the City of Albuquerque which operates public radio station KANW. KANW already owns KIDS 88.1 in Grants so KDRI would become a second station in the area.

After 1993 members included Thaddeus Corea and Jason Payne on drums/percussion and Skip Ward on bass.  Biography  Formed in early 1992 as an impromptu jam session at an Irish coffee house in Hollywood called Caf√© Beckett. Singer Angela McCluskey had gathered together a group of fellow musicians to arrange a ‚Äúmusical evening‚Äù to showcase her friend/guitarist Shark, who had recently relocated to Los Angeles from New York. Brought aboard were Paul Cantelon, on violin and piano; Scott Roewe, on bass, keyboards, and saxophone; and Ian Bernard (drums/percussion) and other revolving special guests. The ‚Äúmusical evening‚Äù evolved into a regular gig from the group soon to be known as Wild Colonials - named after the Irish song ‚ÄúWild Colonial Boy.‚Äù Also joining in with the ever changing line up of guests included Dave King (Flogging Molly), Vivian Campbell (Def Leppard), and several members of the Hothouse Flowers and Leonard Cohen's touring band. From Caf√© Beckett the group developed a large following, performing regularly at Molly Malone's, an Irish pub in Los Angeles, and then moving to Caf√© Largo a larger venue in West Hollywood. With a Tuesday night residency that lasted several months the buzz that developed in the LA music scene procured the Wild Colonials a record deal with DGC/Geffen Records. Fruit of Life (1994) and This Can‚Äôt Be Life (1996) were both released to critical acclaim, landing the group as the second stage headliner on the prestigious Lilith Fair lineup in 1997. Over that time, Wild Colonials‚Äìeither as a group or as individual artists - have performed music for several films- a collection of unreleased tracks, soundtrack only tracks and score cues was collected to make up their third album \\"Reel Life vol 1\\" (2000) (released through indie label Chromatic Records). The band's fourth album was intended to be released as four separate EPs under the umbrella name Life As We Know It (UMe/Universal). To date only EP 1/4 has been released. The band members have a number of connections to other celebrities and musicians: Thaddeus Corea is the son of pianist/composer Chick Corea, violinist Paul Cantelon is the brother in law of American singer Rickie Lee Jones, and vocalist Angela McCluskey is British singer Lily Allen's Godmother.

Buildings and Grounds  The school was originally opened on 16 April 1907 as a Continuation School located at 208 Sturt Street (located directly opposite the Ballarat Town Hall). This initial location was due to the need to make alterations to the Dana Street Primary school building. Initially, 37 students were enrolled. In September of 1907, the school moved to a building attached to Dana Street Primary School which allowed for a larger enrollment to be taken on as well as more staff. In March 1909 it was announced that the foundation stone of the Agricultural College would be laid that month. In April 1910 the Ballarat Continuation School moved to its present site at the corner of Sturt and Gillies streets, Lake Gardens. The new building cost around 10,000 pound to construct (approximately $1.3 million in 2018 terms) with a further 1000 pounds for fittings and fixtures. The school then became known as the Ballarat Agricultural High School. Many buildings were constructed around the grounds for the farm, including a concrete silo which still stands today and is listed on the Heritage Council of Victoria's register.Heritage Council Victoria Ballarat High School In July 1915 the new building was almost completely destroyed by a fire. The building was rebuilt over the next 18 months and classes resumed at the start of the 1917 school year. During the time between the fire and classes resuming, students were housed in various locations across Ballarat including the Lydiard Street Methodist Sunday School, St Pauls Hall in Ballarat East, the School of Mines, Humffray Street State School and the Ballarat East Town Hall. During 1926 it was decided that the farm was no longer a viable option, and the decision was made to terminate the farming operations. Prior to this, in 1925 the school became known as a District High School, and it is believed that Ballarat High School may be the only school in Victoria to have been a Continuation School, an Agricultural High School, a District High School and finally a High School. The former farm area was converted into some of the best school sporting grounds in Ballarat. Through the 1960s and 1970s the schools buildings expanded with the construction of the Junior Wing in 1962 (now reconstructed and known as the Transparent Learning Center), the Science Wing in 1965 (currently housing Technology Classes during the reconstruction of the Technology Wing) and the Sheehan Wing in 1976 (recently completely refurbished and redesigned in 2018‚Äì19). In 1979 a single court Gymnasium was constructed and opened in February 1980. During 1996 and 1997 this was extended to a total of 3 full-size basketball courts. In 1991 a new amenities building was constructed and linked to the original 1910 Canteen. This was further enhanced with the introduction of a self service system for students in 1996. In 1993 the Art and Technology faculties moved into a new purpose- built building which also had the effect of creating the \\"quadrangle\\" which has become the center of the school. During the 1980s and 1990s the North Wing's eclectic collection of portables came together with the addition of a gallery to make the area more waterproof. In late 2004 the Robinson Center saw classes begin for Music, Drama and Food Technology courses, with the building replacing many classrooms across the school that had previously been used for these purposes. The former Drama Center behind the North Wing was demolished soon after the Robinson Center was completed. In 2018 a new purpose-built Senior Learning Center was constructed on the Gillies street side of the school, housing Science Labs as well as being the new home for Year 12 students. Also in 2018 a new ARCH Learning Center was constructed on the Western End of the School Grounds. This was the new home for the schools Year 9 students who partake in the focused Year 9 program. This program was named the ARCH program, standing for Active, Resilient, Connected and Happy ‚Äì but also referencing the school's location near the Arch of Victory. In Term 4, 2019 Art and Technology classes where relocated from the Art/Technology building to allow it to undergo a major reconstruction. The building is expected to re-open in Term 3 of 2020.  Peacock Hall  When the main building was rebuilt and extended after the 1915 fire, the Assembly Hall was relocated to the top floor. The hall was opened by then Premier Alexander Peacock and features large stained glass windows across both ends of the hall, as well as Honour boards listing students' war service in both World Wars. Boards along the side walls also list School Captains, Council Members, the Dux of the School as well as University graduates. The stained glass windows were designed by local artist Amalia Field, while staff member Les Ottoway persuaded well known Melbourne artist George Dancey to design a memorial mural tablet for the hall. The tablet was unveiled by Major Baird on the 9th of April 1920 and features a finely executed mosaic mural symbolising the triumph of Good over Evil. The mosaic is seen as a fitting reminder of the school's contribution to the First World War. In 2015 as part of the school's commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli, Ceramics teacher Paul Gerardi was the driving force behind the design and production of Ceramic Poppies with a display being placed on the school oval for the commemoration service. After the service, 100 of the poppies were formed into the shape of a wreath and mounted on the wall of Peacock Hall. The remainder of the Poppies were sold with funds raised being donated to the Ballarat branch of Legacy Australia. Peacock Hall is listed on the Heritage Council of Victoria's register.  Sports  The school's rowing tradition dates back to its Agricultural High School roots, but the school was not admitted to the BPSA until 1944. An early Head of the Lake win came in 1947, but rowing struggled until the construction of the schools Boat Shed on the shore of nearby Lake Wendouree in 1960. This facility has been upgraded several times over the years. Since 1996, the school has been a specialist sport school and is a member of the Ballarat Public Schools' Association.

The arid desert conditions along the coast of Peru have allowed for the preservation of these dyed textiles, which can date to 6000 years old. Many of the surviving textile samples were from funerary bundles, however, these textiles also encompassed a variety of functions. These functions included the use of woven textiles for ceremonial clothing or cloth armorLechtman, Heather. \\"Technologies of Power: The Andean Case.\\" In Configurations of Power: Holistic Anthropology in Theory and Practice, ed. John S. Henderson and Patricia J. Netherly, 254. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1993. as well as knotted fibers for record-keeping. The textile arts were instrumental in political negotiations, and were used as diplomatic tools that were exchanged between groups. Textiles were also used to communicate wealth, social status, and regional affiliation with others. The cultural emphasis on the textile arts was often based on the believed spiritual and metaphysical qualities of the origins of materials used, as well as cosmological and symbolic messages within the visual appearance of the textiles. Traditionally, the thread used for textiles was spun from indigenous cotton plants, as well as alpaca and llama wool. Origins = Lithic Period = The earliest known surviving textiles are samples of fiberwork found in Guitarrero Cave, Peru dating back to 8000 BCE. Early fiberwork by the Norte Chico civilization consisted of plant fibers that were intertwined and knotted to form baskets and other containers. Surviving examples of finely spun thread and simple cloths indicate that knowledge of spinning and weaving had already been well-established and developed in the area. Mummified human skeletons dating to this period were stuffed with plant fibers and wrapped in rope and cane, a preservation method invented in the Chilean Chinchoros area around 5000 BC. Existence of this technology demonstrates early knowledge of spinning naturally occurring fibers into cord. = Pre-Ceramic Era = Coastal civilizations were the first to create fishnets, and were the first to utilize the openwork tradition in knotted objects. The fishnets were created through twining, a non-loom technique similar to macram√©. Knotting patterns depicting standing humans, parrots, snakes, and cats have been decoded from surviving fragments. = Initial Period = The introduction of camelid herding for their meat, fibrous hair, and ability to transport cargo was developed in response to remarkably inhospitable environmental conditions found in Andean highlands. As a result, alpacas and llamas were revered for their hardiness and ability to provide resources in both life and death. The scaly fibers produced by these animals were both flexible and dye-permeable, allowing them to be woven with cotton to produce sturdy threads and textiles. Chav√≠n culture began to emerge around the late Initial Period (c. 900-500 BC). Surviving textiles found from looted burials feature brown dye painted on large, seamed panels of cloth. Textiles from the burials of Karwa are featured as ritual cult center objects, and depict explicitly feminine deities. The Chav√≠n culture may have demonstrated the first extensive production of textiles for ritualistic and symbolic purposes. Paracas culture rapidly developed the textile industry into a time-intensive and labor-consuming practice. Embroidered and woven textiles became commonplace, Moche unku shirt fragment. featuring consistent repetition and variation of motifs. Nonwoven fabric structures, such as headbands, were created through cross-knit looping. Paracas officials adopted the practice of wearing multiple garments in sets, including headbands, turbans, mantles, ponchos, tunics, skirts, and loincloths. The Moche wove textiles, mostly using wool from vicu√±a and alpaca. Although there are few surviving examples of this, descendants of the Moche people have strong weaving traditions. = Middle Horizon = The Middle Horizon is characterized by the supremacy of the Wari and Twanaku cultures over the central Andes. Wari, as the former capital city was called, is located 11 km (6.8 mi) north-east of the modern city of Ayacucho, Peru. This city was the center of a civilization that covered much of the highlands and coast of modern Peru.Wari wool-pile cap, 700-900 C.E., Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven.The discovery in early 2013 of an undisturbed royal tomb, El Castillo de Huarmey, offers new insight into the social and political influence of the Wari during this period. The variety and extent of the burial items accompanying the three royal women indicate a culture with significant material wealth and the power to dominate a significant part of northern coastal Peru for many decades.[4] The Wari are particularly known for their textiles, which were well-preserved in desert burials. The standardization of textile motifs serves as artistic evidence of state control over elite art production in the Wari state.[7] Surviving textiles include tapestries, hats and tunics for high-ranking officials. There are between six and nine miles of thread in each tunic, and they often feature highly abstracted versions of typical Andean artistic motifs, such as the Staff God. It is possible that these abstract designs served \\"a mysterious or esoteric code to keep out uninitiated foreign subjects\\" and that the geometric distortions made the wearer's chest appear larger to reflect their high rank.[7] Wari fiber arts featured large-scale textiles created in state-sponsored workshops. Political messages of abundance and control were depicted using chaotic geometric imagery and camelid-like figures. Examples of surviving imagery (see image) feature multiple repeating motifs of highly geometric patterns, punctuated with highly expressive color palettes. Scholars have argued that the complexity of such designs broadcast the abilities and abundances of state- controlled resources. = Late Intermediate Period = Some of the main cultures during the late intermediate period were Lambayeque, Chimor, and Chancay, late Cajamarca, Chincha, late Chachapoya, Wanka, Chanka, Qolia, Lupaca, Yaro, Warko, and others Lambayeque emerged around the 750 AD, with its peak between 900 AD and 1100. The Lambayeque style of textiles often combined the styles of earlier cultures, like the Moche and the Wari, but added its own local iconography. This led to a unique style of textile art. These earlier influences from the Wari and Moche include emphasis on narratives. However, Lambayeque's local style included motifs such as sea birds and fish, as well as crescent-shaped headdresses. The Chancay tended to have many different styles in their textiles.These styles included openwork, painted, slit tapestry, and three-dimensional figures. The Chancay textiles tended to use soft colors, which contrasts with the Chim√∫, who used bright, vibrant colors. = Late Horizon (Inca Period) = Inca cloth played an important role in both the social and economic foundations of the empire. Cloth production was, after agriculture, the second largest industry in the Inca Empire and was linked to social stratification.  Coarse Cloth ‚Äì Chusi  The coarsest grade of Inca cloth was called chusi. Chusi was not worn, but used for basic household items such as blankets, rugs and sacking. \\"Individual threads used in this type of cloth were said to sometimes be as thick as a finger.  Standard Cloth ‚Äì Awaska  The next grade of Inca weaving was known as awaska. Of all the ancient Peruvian textiles, this was the grade most commonly used in the production of Inca clothing. Awaska was made from llama or alpaca wool and had a much higher thread count (approximately 120 threads per inch) than that found in chusi cloth. Thick garments made from awaska were worn as standard amongst the lower-classes of the Andean highlands, while lighter cotton clothing was produced on the warmer coastal lowlands. Peruvian Pima cotton, as used by the Incas, is still regarded as one of the finest cottons available on today‚Äôs market.  Textiles of Tawantisuyu's Nobility & Royalty ‚Äì Qompi  The finest Inca textiles were reserved for the nobility and the royalty, including the emperor himself. This cloth, known as qompi (alternative spellings cumbi or kumpi), was of exceptionally high quality and required a specialized and state-run body of dedicated workers. Qompi cloth was produced in state-run institutions called aklla-wasi. Here, chosen women (aklla) weaved clothes for the nobility and clergy. A full-time body of male weavers, the qompi-kamayok produced qompi cloth for the state. Qompi was made from the finest materials available to the Inca. Alpaca, particularly baby alpaca, and vicu√±a wool were used to create elaborate and richly decorated items. As a result of their smoothness, Inca textiles made of vicu√±a fiber are described as \\"silk\\" by the first Spanish explorers. Remarkably, the finest Inca cloth had a thread count of more than 600 threads per inch, higher than that found in cotemporaneous European textiles and not excelled anywhere in the world until the industrial revolution in the 19th century.  Tawantisuyu nationals' costume  The style of Inca clothing was subject to geography. Heavier, warmer materials were common in the colder Andean highlands (such as llama, alpaca and vicuna wool, the latter being worn almost exclusively by royalty), while lighter cloth was used in the warmer coastal lowlands (usually cotton). However, the basic design of Inca costume differed little throughout the Inca realm, with the quality of the materials and the value of decorative items making most of the differentiation of the social ranks. = Clothing Worn by Women = The main item of Inca clothing worn by women was a long dress known as an anaku (regional difference in style existed, with the aksu, a longer version of the male unku, being common). The anaku reached to the wearer's ankles and was held around the waist by a broad belt or sash called a chumpi. A type of shawl or mantle, known as a lliclla, was worn over the shoulders. The mantle was fastened with tupu pins made of copper, bronze, silver, or gold. The mantle was used as a carrying device during the Inca farming process and other daily tasks. As was the case throughout the empire, the materials used in the fabrication of all these items depended upon the rank of the wearer. = Clothing Worn by Men = A usually sleeveless shirt or tunic, known as an unku (or cushma), was the main item of men's dress. The unku was commonly rectangular in form, however variations existed, the unku worn by the people of the Altiplano (Qolla, Lupaca, etc.) was rather trapezoidal for instance. The majority of the surviving examples of the unku having a width to length ratio of about 7:9. UIt was about 30 ins (76 cm) wide, reached to just above the knee in most Inca provinces (wamani), and had slits for the head and arms. Unku varieties worn in some areas of the warmer coastal provinces were much shorter in comparison to typical Inca unku, some reached to just above the waist (resembling the proportions used by the local ancient desert people such as the Nazca-Paracas), others were hip length, both could be used in tandem with a skirt. Inca military unku were easily identifiable by their black and white checkered design. A great deal of recovered Inca unku (shirts and tunics) are from the coast of Peru and Chile, rather than the Andes highlands, due to the climate of the Atacama desert being much more favorable for textile preservation. Beneath this tunic was worn a breechclout or wara, a type of loincloth, it was exclusively worn by men and consisted of two rectangular strips of material that hung down from the wearer's waist. Wrapped skirts were worn in some provinces. An outer garment called a yakkoya (cloak) was worn over the unku. The yacolla was basically a blanket that could be thrown over the shoulders. While working, or dancing, the yacolla was tied over one shoulder to keep it in place. Men and women often carried a woven bag known as a chuspa. The bag hung down by the wearer's side from a strap about the neck. The bag held such items as coca leaves, personal possessions, slingstones, among other things. Male belts were much more narrow than the waistbands worn by women, and unlike women, it was not mandatory for men to wear them, nevertheless in some provinces belts seem to have been quite popular, however it appears that they did not enjoy much popularity among the ethnic-Inca nobility of Cusco, judging by the representations of themselves. A hybrid of a belt and a bag (chuspa) was very popular and commonly worn among the ethnic groups of the Altiplano in the south of the Empire. Pair of Inca shoes made of camelid wool. Headdresses were very diverse in shape and form, many kinds of hats, turbans and headbands, even including things like deer antlers, slings, or cords wrapped around the head were worn. The various headdresses and head adornments indicated the place of origin of the diverse inhabitants of the Tawantinsuyu. Thus, for instance the Wanka wore a wide black headband on their heads, the Chachapoya wore wollen turbans (probably of white color), the Yungas or coastal peoples wore turbans \\"like those of the gypsies\\", while the Kana wore bonnets larger than those of the Qolla, those of Cajamarca wore slings on top of their hair. = Inca footwear = It was not uncommon, for many members of society, particularly among the lower classes but without excluding the nobility, to spend most of their time bare-footed. Several types of sandals, shoes similar in design to Native American moccasins prior to European influence, and high boots worn in the coldest areas, were the types of footwear worn by both men and women. The soles of Inca sandals could be made from leather or woven plant fibers, among other materials. The upper part of the sandal consisted of brightly-colored braided woolen cord.  Record- keeping  Woven textiles A page from the El primer nueva cor√≥nica y buen gobierno by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, ca. 1600. Traditional Inca weaving, as depicted in Spanish text. = Manufacturing technique = A miniature unku shirt for children. Many textiles, such as baskets and fishing nets, did not require the use of a loom. The Andeans used the back strap loom to create woven textiles, as chronicled in El primer nueva cor√≥nica y buen gobierno. Several techniques were used to produce fabric, including plain weave, tapestry weave, and scroll weave. Smaller woven pieces produced on the same loom were often stitched together to create a larger fabric. Borders of embroidered tunics and mantles are often decorated with yarn tassels or fringe. Prehistoric Andean weavers pioneered new weaving techniques, such as the triple weave and quadruple weave. The use of fine yarn and consistency in stitch size is remarkable, with analyses counting an average of 250 wefts per inch on average, and some samples exceeding 500 wefts per inch. This is attributed to the regularity in diameter and consistency of thread, as well as maintenance of tension on the loom throughout the entire weaving process. A combination of cotton and dyed camelid threads contribute structural strength and colorful visual imagery to textiles. The scaly hair of camelids is permeable to dye, allowing natural plant-based dyes to be fixed to camelid fibers in the presence of a natural mordant, such as urine. Complex combinations of coloration and patterning were used to repeat geometric patterns while maintaining visual consistency; Paracas textiles are especially well known for their regular gridlike arrangement of iconographic images. The consistency of scale and shape of these patterns point to the use of counting systems used by textile artisans to record the number of stitches and distance between each geometric pattern. = Workshop production = Chancay or Chimu painted textile, 800-1200 C.E., Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven. Several different methods of embroidery are attributed to distinctive styles of coloring and depiction of images in woven textiles. Block color, linear, and broad line styles of embroidery imparted different visual effects upon the woven textile, and were used to convey different types of information. Designs were also painted directly onto woven textiles using various dyes (see figure). Professional textile artisans in pre-Incan cultures often worked in large workshops with artisans in several specialties. Proximity to other artisans allowed for additional features to be incorporated into plain weave textiles, including metallic threads, knotted strings of feathers, and brocading. Textile painting was common practice in the preparation of special cloths for funerary bundles of high-ranking members of society. Pigments such as ochre and cinnabar have been used for painting textiles since the Early Horizon period.Tupu pin, 1400-1533 AD, left = Social significance = Intricately woven mantles were created to be worn by nobles and elites, both in life and death. Mantles were often extensive and large, averaging 275 centimeters in length and 130 centimeters in width, and were draped around the neck and over the shoulders. Women fastened fabrics at the front of the body with a tupu, or shawl pin. The size of the mantle and foreshortening effects of imagery contributed to the appearance of the wearer as being \\"larger than life,\\" serving as explicit status symbols. Bright dyes served to distinguish social elite from those of lesser status, as undyed fabric worn by commoners was brown. Chinchero officers wore red ponchos to signify rank during formal government occasions. Inca rulers wore a llautu, or tasseled red fringe, on their forehead to demonstrate their status. Gifts were also given to conquered territories in ceremonial shows of dominance over the peoples of the region. A region's ability to produce textiles was intricately connected to its success of camelid herding, indicating the value of state-controlled wealth in a territory. = Burial bundles = Woven garments worn during life indicated an individual's social rank, and were often interred with the individual in death. Gift textiles created expressly for funerary purposes were also interred, without being worn in life. Ritual gift objects wrapped in \\"mummy bundles\\" include obsidian knives, combs, and balls of thread. Paracas culture practiced mummification by wrapping the deceased in several layers of woven textiles. Over 429 funeral bundles containing gift textiles, reams of plain cloth, and various ritual paraphernalia have been excavated from a necropolis at Cerro Colorado. These artifacts offer the largest source of pre-Columbian Andean textile arts known to date. Military use While Andean civilizations had knowledge of and were capable of working metal, quilted armor was preferred for its light weight and flexibility. Soldiers depicted by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala wear cloth tunics and wind strips of fabric around themselves to create a sturdy armor that allowed for movement while providing defense. The use of cloth rather than metallic armor was also motivated by cultural reasons. The properties of cloth were believed to transfer spiritual reinforcement and power to its wearer, supplying strength and force. For similar reasons, woven slings made of plant fibers were the preferred weapons of Moche civilization, rather than stiff wooden or metallic implements. Cloth blankets and tent-making equipment were readily transportable, allowing caches of resources to be delivered to battle frontiers. Storage warehouses containing cloth equipment have been excavated throughout Tawantin Suyu. Defeated armies forced to retreat often burned all cloth unable to be carried, preventing enemy forces from capturing these valuable stashes.  Colonial Period  Woman's mantle, 1600-1700 C.E., Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire resulted in the immigration of Spanish settlers to on the Andean coast. Middle- and upper-class Spanish families recognized the value of finely woven native textiles, and demanded luxury textiles to decorate their own homes. As a result, cumbi, a fine tapestry cloth woven from alpaca fibers, was modified to a Spanish color palette and produced for the homes and churches of settlers. The term tornasol refers to the style of textile absorbed by Andean weavers after the European context, characterized by a silky texture that appears to change color from different perspectives. Native weavers modified their technique to produce common items for their colonial audience. Bedcovers, table covers, rugs, and wall hangings became popular textile formats in the late 18th century. European influences introduced lace-inspired borders and stylized circular patterns. While garments had traditionally been brightly colored and highly patterned, the garments worn by highland Andeans during the Colonial period were characteristically plain and black. This has been interpreted as an act of mourning for the lost Inca empire, but may also be a result of cultural influence imported by arriving Spanish colonists.

He is considered one of the greatest writers in Latvian history and particularly a master of realism. The building of a flat in Riga that he once lived has been converted to a memorial museum named partially in his honor, the Janis RozentƒÅls and R≈´dolfs Blaumanis museum.  Biography  R≈´dolfs Blaumanis was born at ƒírgƒºi, Latvia on December 20, 1862. His father Matƒ´ss Blaumanis was a cook in the local manor and his mother Karlƒ´ne was a housemaid. Blaumanis started his education in a private school in the Ogre parish. He studied there until 1875. Then he traveled to Riga and started studies in a German merchant school until 1881. After graduation he started to work as a clerk in a trading enterprise. During this period he started to write his first works. First publication- a story Wiedergefunden was published in 1882 in [German language] newspaper Zeitung f√ºr Stadt und Land. In 1882 he returned to his native Braki homestead and lived there until 1885. In this period he deepened his Latvian language knowledge. In 1885 he became a secretary in the Koknese manor and studied to become a steward. He spent there two years. In 1886 was published his first work in the Latvian language- poem Nakts (Night). From 1887 until 1889 he again lived in the Braki and wrote several novels in Latvian and also German languages. Portrait of R≈´dolfs Blaumanis by Janis RozentƒÅls In 1889 he moved to Riga and after two years started to work in editorial office of Zeitung f√ºr Stadt und Land where he wrote about Latvian cultural life. In 1890 his first play Zagƒºi (Thieves) was staged in Riga. In the following years several more of his plays was staged with good success. In 1892 collection of his novels was translated into Estonian and later several more of his works was published in Estonia. After father's death in 1894 he again lived in Braki homestead in his native ƒírgƒºi parish for four years and tried to become a farmer. Later he briefly worked in the New Current's main newspaper Dienas Lapa where he published satire against romanticism. In 1898 he returned to Riga and together with Aspazija and JƒÅnis Poruks worked in one of the biggest journal (home guest In 1900 he together with his friend Andrievs Niedra published collection of poetry. In 1901 he moved to St.Petersburg, where he worked as journalist and editor in Latvian newspaper Pƒìterburgas avƒ´zes. He led a satirical section of the newspaper. In 1904 due to the financial and health problems he returned to Latvia and until 1906 lived in Braki. In this period he wrote some of his most famous plays. He was not directly involved in the Revolution of 1905 but supported writers who were. In 1906 he again moved to Riga and started to work in the newspaper Latvija where he led satirical section. In this period he shared a flat in Riga with his close friend painter Janis RozentƒÅls. In 1908 his health started to decline. Due to the financial problems he was not able to undergo treatment. However several fellow Latvian writers started a fundraising campaign and in late summer with the help of painters J. Rozentals Finnish wife Blaumanis was able to go to Finland. However that was too late and he died on 4 September 1908 in the Punkaharju sanatorium for tubercular patients in Finland. He was buried in his native ƒírgƒºi village. His homestead in Braki has been turned into a museum and memorial. Bibliography =Translations= * In the Lap of Happiness, Translation by TamƒÅra ZƒÅlƒ´te. Moscow: Foreign Languages Pub.

The ziggurat E-ibe- Anu, dedicated to the goddess Urash, was located in the center of the city and was mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Stephen Langdon, The Epic of Gilgamish. A Fragment of the Gilgamish Legend in Old-Babylonian Cuneiform, 1919  History  Dilbat was founded during the Sumerian Early Dynastic II period, around 2700 BC. It is known to have been occupied, at least, during the Akkadian, Old Babylonian, Kassite, Sasanian and Early Islamic periods. It was an early agricultural center cultivating einkorn wheat and producing reed products.A. Goddeeris, Economy and Society in Northern Babylonia, Peeters , 2002, It lay on the Arahtum canal.  Archaeology  The site of Tell al- Deylam consists of two mounds, a small western mound with 1st millennium BC and Early Islamic remains and a larger east mound, roughly 500 meters in circumference, with remains from the 1st to 3rd millennium BC. Dilbat was excavated briefly by Hormuzd Rassam, who recovered some cuneiform tablets at the site, mainly from the Neo-Babylonian period.Hormuzd Rassam and Robert William Rogers, Asshur and the land of Nimrod, Curts & Jennings, 1897 The site was worked in 1989 by J.

Particular attention was given to accounts by pilgrims and other travelers containing geographical or topographical information, as well as those which discussed the manners and customs of the Holy Land. The original narratives were written in a variety of languages, including Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Old French, Russian, and German. The Society first started publishing its work in 1884, and continued for eleven years, publishing a total of twelve volumes. In 1896, these works were transferred to the Palestine Exploration Fund, for distribution to the members of the PPTS.The New International Encyclopedia, edited by Daniel Coit Gilman, Harry Thurston Peck, Frank Moore Colby, 1903 The editions remain valuable and are frequently cited in scholarly works. A version is also available as The library of the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society. Certain well-known pilgrimages included are those of: Jacques de Vitry, Saint Jerome's Pilgrimage of the Holy Paula, Mukaddasi's description of Syria, and the Itinerarium Burdigalense.

Jones took the name of the band from a Hallmark Cards shopping display, and first formed the group in 1981 with singer Jim Drummond and drummer Mike Greenlees. Biography Cheer-Accident's first album, Life Isn't Like That, was released in 1986, after which Drummond and Greenlees left the group. They were replaced by bassist Chris Block and guitarist Jeff Libersher. The group's second release, 1988's Sever Roots, Tree Dies, which was produced and engineered by the Phil Bonnet. Their 1990 EP, Dumb Ask, was produced by Steve Albini, and following this the group signed to British label Neat Records. However, the album was pressed poorly and the group severed its ties to the label, and went back to recording for Complacency Records with Bonnet, who by that time had joined the group on guitar. Block left the band in 1992 and was replaced by Dan Forden, after which the group returned to the studio. In 1994, the group released The Why Album and helped start a local Chicago Public- access television show called Cool Clown Ground. Albini recorded the group's next release, Not a Food (recorded in July 1994 and eventually released in 1996). Shortly after these sessions, Forden left the band and was then replaced with Dylan Posa (formerly of The Flying Luttenbachers). By this time, Cheer-Accident members were collaborating regularly with other Chicago indie artists such as U.S. Maple, Bobby Conn, Gastr del Sol, and Smog. In January 1999, Phil Bonnet died of a brain aneurysm while the group recorded material for its eighth album, Salad Days. The group decided to continue with Jamie Fillmore filling Bonnet's role as guitarist. Also, a 1997 recording session, which yielded a 52-minute song called \\"Trading Balloons\\", was released as an EP. Salad Days was finally released on Skin Graft Records in October 2000. The group serves as an occasional live backup band for Harvey Sid Fisher. In 2001, Fischer and the band collaborated on a cover of \\"52 Girls\\" for the B-52s tribute album, Wigs on Fire!, which was released on Nihilist Records. In 2003, the group recorded another full-length for Skin Graft, Introducing Lemon, as well as a soundtrack CD to a comic book called Gumballhead the Cat. In 2006, Cheer-Accident performed at North East Sticks Together in Boston.

The street begins in the town of Montreal West and ends on the extreme tip of the island in Pointe-aux- Trembles, intersecting Gouin Boulevard and joining up with Notre-Dame Street. East of Cavendish Boulevard this road is part of Quebec Route 138. The street is divided into two portions. Sherbrooke Street East is located east of Saint Laurent Boulevard and Sherbrooke Street West is located west. Sherbrooke Street West is home to many historic mansions that comprised its exclusive Golden Square Mile district, including the now-demolished Van Horne Mansion, the imposing Beaux-Arts style Montreal Masonic Memorial Temple as well as several historic properties incorporated into Maison Alcan, the world headquarters for Alcan. Sherbrooke Street East runs along the edge (both administrative and topographic) of the Plateau Mont-Royal, at the top of a marked hillside known as C√¥te √† Baron, and continues between the Jardin Botanique de Montr√©al and Parc Maisonneuve to the north and Parc Olympique to the south. The street is named for John Coape Sherbrooke, the Governor General of British North America from 1816-18. History In 1817, Sherbrooke Street initially consisted of two sections, from de Bleury Street to Sanguinet Street. Its relative remoteness from downtown at the time made it difficult to establish industries or factories. Many nursing homes and educational institutions were established on the street in the 19th century, such as McGill University, the √âcole normale Jacques-Cartier, the Coll√®ge Mont-Saint- Louis, and the Couvent du Bon Pasteur. From the early 20th century to the 1930s, Sherbrooke Street was the most prestigious street in Montreal. In 1912, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts was established on Sherbrooke Street West. Later, with the expansion of the city centre, luxurious new houses were built a little farther west in the new Garden City of Westmount. Sherbrooke Street was extended eastward from the early 20th century and followed the urban development of Montreal eastward. It was central to the creation of several institutions and parks such as La Fontaine Park, the Notre-Dame Hospital, Maisonneuve Park, Montreal Botanical Garden and Olympic Stadium. In 1976, the street was to be venue for an 8 km exhibit of art entitled Corridart during the 1976 Summer Olympics. However, in a controversial decision, former Mayor Jean Drapeau had the exhibition torn down two days before the Games began.Melvin Charney interview, canadianart.ca, January 21, 2002. Educational institutions Three of Montreal's four major universities are on Sherbrooke Street. Downtown is the main campus of McGill University, and farther west is the Loyola Campus of Concordia University. The street also has UQAM's Complexe des sciences Pierre-Dansereau and INRS's Montr√©al campus as well as Dawson College, Coll√®ge de Maisonneuve CEGEPs, and the Coll√®ge de Montr√©al. Attractions Other key attractions on the street include the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Grand S√©minaire de Montr√©al, McCord Museum, Ritz-Carlton Montreal, Holt Renfrew, Parc Lafontaine, and further east, the Ch√¢teau Dufresne, Olympic Stadium, Montreal Botanical Garden and the Montreal Biodome.

Born in Toronto, Ontario and raised in the isolated mining community of Schefferville, Quebec, Clarke has since worked at a number of careers. These include stints as a marine engineer on Great Lakes vessels, a high-rise construction carpenter, a dairy farmer, a Toronto police officer, and a power plant operator at a paper mill. Thus it is perhaps understandable that his songs often reveal his working-class background. Over the years, he has performed his music across the United States and Canada. His debut studio CD, Lorne Clarke was released in 1999 and in 2007 released his second studio CD titled Moonlight & Cider. In 2000, he became the artistic director and promoter for The Old Lynn Concerts in Lynn, Pennsylvania. This unique, free, concert series runs to packed houses and presents concerts by contemporary folk artists from all over the world. Clarke is widely known for his continuing work with American song writer, Tom Flannery ‚Äì specifically the two theme-based song cycles: Rwanda Songs in 2004 and Hands in the Dark in 2006.

Rising to 670 ft (204 m), it is the 84th tallest building in New York. History Gershwin Theatre The sunken plaza with subway entrance The Uris Building, designed by Emery Roth and Sons, was built in 1970 on the site of the former Capitol Theatre movie palace. It was developed by the Uris brothers, who, at the time, claimed to be the largest private real estate developers in New York City.

The tower that occupies most of the block west of Broadway between West 51st and 50th Streets has interior space of . It was originally called the Uris Building for the developers, and the associated Uris Theatre (later renamed the Gershwin Theatre) is one of the largest Broadway houses. A smaller theatre operated by the non-profit Circle in the Square company is also in the space. After the death of his brother, Harold Uris sold Uris Building Corp, including this building, to the National Kinney Corporation which in 1974 faced with 30 percent vacancy rates took the building into bankruptcy before the Paramount Investment Group led a partnership that purchased it. The partnership continued to own the structure until 2015 when Paramount Investment purchased the remaining 25 percent. Paramount continued as sole owner until April 2020 when it announced it would sell a ten percent stake. Paramount renamed the building. Portions of The King of Comedy and Silent Movie were shot there. The Uris Theatre was eventually renamed the Gershwin. The southern of the two sunken plazas on Broadway has a gymnasium and an entrance to the 50th Street subway station () of the New York City Subway.

The Mongols occupied parts of the subcontinent for decades. As the Mongols progressed into the Indian hinterland and reached the outskirts of Delhi, the Delhi Sultanate led a campaign against them in which the Mongol army suffered serious defeats.  Background  After pursuing Jalal ad-Din into India from Samarkand and defeating him at the battle of Indus in 1221, Genghis Khan sent two tumens (20,000 soldiers) under commanders Dorbei the Fierce and Bala to continue the chase. The Mongol commander Bala chased Jalal ad-Din throughout the Lahore region and attacked outlying province Multan, and even sacked the outskirts of Lahore. Jalal ad-Din regrouped, forming a small army from survivors of the battle and sought an alliance, or even an asylum, with the Turkic rulers of Delhi Sultanate, but was turned down. Jalal ad-Din fought against the local rulers in Punjab. After being defeated by many of them in the open, he retreated to the outskirts of Punjab seeking refuge in Multan. While fighting against the local governor of Sindh, Jalal ad-Din heard of an uprising in the Kirman province of southern Iran and he immediately set out for that place, passing through southern Baluchistan on the way. Jalal ad-Din was also joined by forces from Ghor and Peshawar, including members of the Khalji, Turkoman, and Ghori tribes. With his new allies he marched on Ghazni and defeated a Mongol division under Turtai, which had been assigned the task of hunting him down. The victorious allies quarreled over the division of the captured booty; subsequently the Khalji, Turkoman, and Ghori tribesmen deserted Jalal ad-Din and returned to Peshawar. By this time √ñgedei Khan, third son of Genghis Khan, had become Great Khan of the Mongol Empire. A Mongol general named Chormaqan sent by the Khan attacked and defeated Jalal ad-Din, thus ending the KhwƒÅrazm-ShƒÅh dynasty.Chormaqan Noyan: The First Mongol Military Governor in the Middle East by Timothy May  Mongol conquest of Kashmir Some time after 1235 another Mongol force invaded Kashmir, stationing a darughachi (administrative governor) there for several years, and Kashmir became a Mongolian dependency.Thomas T. Allsen-Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia, p.84 Around the same time, a Kashmiri Buddhist master, Otochi, and his brother Namo arrived at the court of √ñgedei. Another Mongol general named Pakchak attacked Peshawar and defeated the army of tribes who had deserted Jalal ad-Din but were still a threat to the Mongols. These men, mostly Khaljis, escaped to Multan and were recruited into the army of the Delhi Sultanate. In winter 1241 the Mongol force invaded the Indus valley and besieged Lahore. However, on December 30, 1241, the Mongols under Munggetu butchered the town before withdrawing from the Delhi Sultanate. At the same time the Great Khan √ñgedei died (1241). The Kashmiris revolted in 1254‚Äì1255, and M√∂ngke Khan, who became Great Khan in 1251, appointed his generals, Sali and Takudar, to replace the court and appointed the Buddhist master, Otochi, as darugachi of Kashmir. However, the Kashmiri king killed Otochi at Srinagar. Sali invaded Kashmir, killing the king, and put down the rebellion, after which the country remained subject to the Mongol Empire for many years.Andr√© Wink-Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, p.208 Intrusion into Dehli Sultanate The Delhi prince, Jalal al-Din Masud, traveled to the Mongol capital at Karakorum to seek the assistance of M√∂ngke Khan in seizing the throne from his elder brother in 1248. When M√∂ngke was crowned as Great Khan, Jalal al-Din Masud attended the ceremony and asked for help from M√∂ngke. M√∂ngke ordered Sali to assist him to recover his ancestral realm. Sali made successive attacks on Multan and Lahore. Sham al-Din Muhammad Kart, the client malik (ruling prince) of Herat, accompanied the Mongols. Jalal al-Din was installed as client ruler of Lahore, Kujah and Sodra. In 1257 the governor of Sindh offered his entire province to Hulagu Khan, Mongke's brother, and sought Mongol protection from his overlord in Delhi. Hulagu led a strong force under Sali Bahadur into Sindh. In the winter of 1257 - beginning of 1258, Sali Noyan entered Sind in strength and dismantled the fortifications of Multan; his forces may also have invested the island fortress of Bakhkar on the Indus. But Hulagu refused to sanction a grand invasion of the Delhi Sultanate and a few years later diplomatic correspondence between the two rulers confirmed the growing desire for peace. Ghiyas ud din Balban's (reigned: 1266‚Äì1287) one absorbing preoccupation was the danger of a Mongol invasion. For this cause he organized and disciplined his army to the highest point of efficiency ; for this he made away with disaffected or jealous chiefs, and steadily refused to entrust authority to Hindus; for this he stayed near his capital and would not be tempted into distant campaigns. Large-scale Mongol invasions of India ceased and the Delhi Sultans used the respite to recover the frontier towns like Multan, Uch, and Lahore, and to punish the local Ranas and Rais who had joined hands with either the Khwarazim or the Mongol invaders.  Chagatai Khanate-Dehlavi Wars  =Transformation of the Dehli Sultanate= There was a rapid change in the balance of power in Northern India as power violently shifted from the Turkic nobles to a new Indo-Mussalman nobility.. A khalji family, who had migrated a century ago to India by accompanying Ghori, would identify themselves with the Indian Muslims, and their khalji and Indo-Muslim faction would grow in strength due to the rising number of converts. With a series of assassinations, they would finally usurp the throne in 1290 and appoint their Indo-Muslim allies such as Zafar Khan (Minister of War), Nusrat Khan (Wazir of Dehli), Ayn al Mulk Multani, Malik Karfur, Malik Tughlaq, and Malik Nayk(Master of the Horse) who were famous warriors but non-Turks, which resulted in the emergence of an Indo-Muslim state. The changes during this period allowed for rapid Dehlavi conquests into the rest of India. At about this time the Mongol raids into India were also renewed (1300) =Rise of the Chagatais= After civil war broke out in the Mongol Empire in the 1260s, the Chagatai Khanate controlled Central Asia and its leader since the 1280s was Duwa Khan who was second in command of Kaidu Khan. Duwa was active in Afghanistan, and attempted to extend Mongol rule into India. The medieval sources claim invasions by hundreds of thousands of Mongols, numbers approximating (and probably based on) the size of the entire cavalry armies of the Mongol realms of Central Asia or the Middle East: about 150,000 men. A count of the Mongol commanders named in the sources as participating in the various invasions might give a better indication of the numbers involved, as these commanders probably led tumens, units nominally of 10,000 men.John Masson Smith, Jr. Mongol Armies and Indian Campaigns. These invasions were led by either various descendants of Genghis Khan or by Mongol divisional commanders; the size of such armies was always between 10,000-30,000 cavalry although the chroniclers of Delhi exaggerated the number to 100,000-200,000 cavalry.John Masson Smith, Jr. Mongol Armies and Indian Campaigns and J.A. Boyle, The Mongol Commanders in Afghanistan and India. The Muslim Negudari governor Abdullah, who was a son of Chagatai Khan's great grandson,Rashid ad- Din - The history of World invaded Punjab with his force in 1292, but their advance guard under Ulghu was defeated and taken prisoner by the Khalji Sultan Jalaluddin. The 4000 Mongol captives of the advance guard converted to Islam and came to live in Delhi as \\"new Muslims\\". The suburb they lived in was appropriately named Mughalpura.J.A. Boyle, \\"The Mongol Commanders in Afghanistan and India According to the Tabaqat-I-Nasiri of Juzjani,\\" Islamic Studies, II (1963); reprinted in idem, The Mongol World Empire (London: Variorum, 1977), see ch. IX, p. 239 Chagatai tumens were beaten by the Delhi Sultanate several times in 1296‚Äì1297.Although Muslim historians claimed Mongols were outnumbered and their army ranged from 100,000 to 200,000, their force was not enough to cow down Delhi mamluks in reality. See John Masson Smith, Jr. Mongol Armies and Indian Campaigns. =Battle of Jaran-Manjur= A 20th century artist's imagination of Alauddin Khalji (d. 1316), the ruler of Delhi. Unlike the previous invasions, the invasions during the reign of Jalaluddin's successor Alauddin were major Mongol conquests. In the winter of 1297, the Chagatai noyan Kadar led an army that ravaged the Punjab region, and advanced as far as Kasur. Alauddin's army, led by Ulugh Khan and probably Zafar Khan defeated on the Battle of Jaran-Manjur on 6 February 1298 where quite a large number of them were taken prisoner. =Siege of Sehwan= Later in 1298‚Äì99, a Mongol army (possibly Neguderi fugitives) invaded Sindh, and occupied the fort of Sivistan. These Mongols were defeated by Zafar Khan: a number of them were arrested and brought to Delhi as captives. At this time, the main branch of Alauddin's army, led by Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan was busy raiding Gujarat. When this army was returning from Gujarat to Delhi, some of its Mongol soldiers staged a mutiny over payment of khums (one-fifth of the share of loot). The mutiny was crushed, and the mutineers families in Delhi were severely punished. =Battle of Killi= In late 1299, Duwa dispatched his son Qutlugh Khwaja to conquer Delhi. Alauddin led his army to Kili near Delhi, and tried to delay the battle, hoping that the Mongols would retreat amid a scarcity of provisions and that he would receive reinforcements from his provinces. However, his general Zafar Khan attacked the Mongol army without his permission. The Mongols feigned a retreat, and tricked Zafar Khan's contingent into following them. Zafar Khan and his men were killed after inflicting heavy casualties on the invaders. The Mongols retreated a couple of days later: their leader Qutlugh Khwaja was seriously wounded, and died during the return journey. =Siege of Delhi= In the winter of 1302‚Äì1303, Alauddin dispatched an army to ransack the Kakatiya capital Warangal, and himself marched to Chittor. Finding Delhi unprotected, the Mongols launched another invasion around August 1303. Alauddin managed to reach Delhi before the invaders, but did not have enough time to prepare for a strong defence. He took shelter in a heavily-guarded camp at the under- construction Siri Fort. The Mongols ransacked Delhi and its neighbourhoods, but ultimately retreated after being unable to breach Siri. This close encounter with the Mongols prompted Alauddin to strengthen the forts and the military presence along their routes to India. He also implemented a series of economic reforms to ensure sufficient revenue inflows for maintaining a strong army. Shortly afterward, Duwa Khan sought to end the ongoing conflict with the Yuan Khagan Tem√ºr √ñljeyt√º, and around 1304 a general peace among the Mongol khanates was declared, bringing an end to the conflict between the Yuan Dynasty and western khanates that had lasted for the better part of a half century. Soon after, he proposed a joint attack on India, but the campaign did not materialize. =Battle of Amroha= In December 1305, Duwa sent another army that bypassed the heavily guarded city of Delhi, and proceeded south-east to the Gangetic plains along the Himalayan foothills. Alauddin's 30,000-strong cavalry, led by Malik Nayak, defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Amroha. A large number of Mongols were taken captive and killed. =Battle of Ravi (1306)= In 1306, another Mongol army sent by Duwa advanced up to the Ravi River, ransacking the territories along the way. This army included three contingents, led by Kopek, Iqbalmand, and Tai-Bu. Alauddin's forces, led by Malik Kafur, decisively defeated the invaders. =Dehlavi counteroffensives= In that same year the Mongol Khan, Duwa, died and in the dispute over his succession this spate of Mongol raids into India ended. Taking advantage of this situation, Alauddin's general Malik Tughluq regularly raided the Mongol territories located in present-day Afghanistan.  Late Mongol invasions  In 1320 the Qaraunas under Zulju (Dulucha) entered Kashmir by the Jehlam Valley without meeting any serious resistance. The Kashmiri king, Suhadeva, tried to persuade Zulju to withdraw by paying a large ransom.Mohibbul Hasan-Kashmir Under the Sultans, p.36 After he failed to organize resistance, Suhadeva fled to Kishtwar, leaving the people of Kashmir to the mercy of Zulju. The Mongols burned the dwellings, massacred the men and made women and children slaves. Only refugees under Ramacandra, commander in chief of the king, in the fort of Lar remained safe. The invaders continued to pillage for eight months until the commencement of winter. When Zulju was departing via Brinal, he lost most of his men and prisoners due to a severe snowfall in Divasar district. The next major Mongol invasion took place after the Khaljis had been replaced by the Tughlaq dynasty in the Sultanate. In 1327 the Chagatai Mongols under Tarmashirin, who had sent envoys to Delhi to negotiate peace the previous year, sacked the frontier towns of Lamghan and Multan and besieged Delhi. The Tughlaq ruler paid a large ransom to spare his Sultanate from further ravages. Muhammad bin Tughluq asked the Ilkhan Abu Sa'id to form an alliance against Tarmashirin, who had invaded Khorasan, but an attack didn't materialize.The Chaghadaids and Islam: the conversion of Tarmashirin Khan (1331-34). The Journal of the American Oriental Society, October 1, 2002. Biran Tarmashirin was a Buddhist who later converted to Islam. Religious tensions in the Chagatai Khanate were a divisive factor among the Mongols. No more large-scale invasions or raids into India were launched after Tamashirin's siege of Delhi. However, small groups of Mongol adventurers hired out their swords to the many local powers in the northwest. Amir Qazaghan raided northern India with his Qara'unas. He also sent several thousand troops to aid the Delhi Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq in suppressing the rebellion in his country in 1350.  Timur and Babur  Timur Timur defeats the Sultan of Delhi, Nasir Al-Din Mahmum Tughluq, in the winter of 1397‚Äì1398 Babur, the Turco-Mongol descendant of Timur, who later invaded India in the 16th century. The Delhi sultans had developed cordial relations with the Yuan dynasty in Mongolia and China and the Ilkhanate in Persia and the Middle East. Around 1338, Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate appointed Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta an ambassador to the Yuan court under Toghon Tem√ºr (Emperor Huizong). The gifts he was to take included 200 slaves. The Chagatai Khanate had split up by this time and an ambitious Mongol Turk chieftain named Timur had brought Central Asia and the regions beyond under his control. He followed the twin policies of Imperialism and Islamization, shifting various Mongol tribes to different parts of his empire and giving primacy to the Turkic people in his own army. Timur also reinforced the Islamic faith over the Chagatai Khanate and gave primacy to the laws of the Shari'ah over Genghis Khan's shamanist laws. He invaded India in 1398 to make war and plunder the wealth of the country. Timur's empire broke up and his descendants failed to hold on to Central Asia, which split up into numerous principalities. The descendants of the Mongol Chagtais and the descendants of Timur empire lived side by side, occasionally fighting and occasionally inter-marrying. One of the products of such a marriage was Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire. His mother belonged to the family of the Mongol Khans of Tashkent. Babur was a true descendant of Timur and shared his beliefs: he believed that rules and regulations of Genghis Khan were deficient as he remarked, \\"they had no divine authority.\\" Even though his own mother was a Mongol, Babur was not very fond of the Mongol race and wrote a stinging verse in his autobiography: :\\"Were the Mughals an angel race, it would be bad, :Even write in gold, the Mughal name would be bad.\\" When Babur occupied Kabul and began invading the Indian subcontinent, he was called a Mughal like all the earlier invaders from the Chagatai Khanate. Even the invasion of Timur had been considered a Mongol invasion since the Mongols had ruled over Central Asia for so long and had given their name to its people.

The block is noted for having buildings by four of Barcelona's most important Modernista architects, Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner, Antoni Gaud√≠, Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Enric Sagnier, in close proximity. As the four architects' styles were very different, the buildings clash with each other and the neighboring buildings. They were all built in the early years of the 20th century. The block is the southwest side of Passeig de Gr√†cia, between Carrer del Consell de Cent and Carrer d'Arag√≥. Name The name of the block label dates from the turn of the twentieth century, when much of the local press greatly satirized the new architectural styles of Modernisme. The words \\"illa\\" and \\"mansana\\" both provide a play on words. \\"Illa de la disc√≤rdia\\" is a Catalan expression that corresponds with the English expression \\"bone of contention,\\" but also literally means \\"block of discord.\\" Similarly, \\"mansana de la disc√≤rdia\\" is a pun that means both \\"block of discord\\" and \\"apple of discord,\\" referring to the golden Apple of Discord in the Judgment of Paris, a Greek myth in which three goddesses participate in a competition to determine which of them is the fairest. Calling the area the \\"Apple of Discord\\" thus refers to the presence of the major Modernista architects all competing for the most impressive architecture (and their styles clashing) on the same city block. History When Barcelona was expanding in the 19th century, the Eixample became a highly fashionable district. Wealthy families moved into large properties lining the Passeig de Gr√†cia, a tree-lined boulevard that served as the area's main thoroughfare and commercial centre. A vogue emerged for refurbishing existing buildings for use as family homes, and many affluent homeowners commissioned prominent architects of the burgeoning Modernista movement to remodel their homes in an often conspicuously opulent style. The first house on the block at 35-43 Passeig de Gr√†cia to be remodelled in the Modernista style was Casa Amatller. It was originally built in 1875 in a relatively plain style, conforming to the guidelines laid out in Ildefons Cerd√†'s 1860 building regulations for the expansion of the Eixample district. In 1898, the Amatller Family commissioned the architect Puig i Cadafalch to carry out a complete transformation of the fa√ßade, the ground and first floors. Cadafalch created a striking new frontage in a Flemish Gothic style with a high stepped gable, ceramic tiles and sculpted animal figures. In contemporary photographs, Casa Amatller can be seen protruding above an otherwise relatively uniform terrace of houses. Within a short period, the vogue for Modernista renovations transformed the block from an unremarkable terrace of houses into a showpiece of new architecture. In 1905, the Catalan Modernista Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner completed his remodelling of the Casa Lle√≥ Morera at the southern end of the block on the corner of Carrer Consell de Cent in a florid, eclectic style with ceramic tiles. Enric Sagnier's 1906 redesign of Casa Mulleras at number 37 was comparatively restrained, adding a sober Neoclassical frontage with a Rococo- style loggia. The renovations completed in 1906 on the house at number 43 were the most striking; originally built in 1877, the house was bought by textile industrialist Josep Batll√≥ in 1900. Following the fashion for house renovations and keen to commission a design that would be conspicuously different from his neighbours' properties, Batll√≥ appointed the audacious Catalan Modernista architect Antoni Gaud√≠ to carry out the work. Gaud√≠'s redesign drew on Modernisme and Art Nouveau, creating a dramatic facade of flowing, sculpted stonework and a colourful, organic roof in the form of a dragon's arched back. The last house to undergo remodelling was Casa Torruella at number 37, now known as Casa Bonet. It was altered by Marcel¬∑l√≠ Coquillat in 1915. By this time, Coquillat had abandoned the ideals of the Modernista and had become an adherent of Noucentisme, a movement that reacted against Modernisme, and his renovations of Casa Bonet are in a much more restrained Neo-Baroque style which is overshadowed by more opulent neighbouring properties. Architecture The houses are the Casa Lle√≥-Morera, at Passeig de Gr√†cia 35, designed by Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner; Casa Mulleras, at Passeig de Gr√†cia 37, designed by Enric Sagnier; Casa Bonet, at Passeig de Gr√†cia 39, designed by Marcel¬∑l√≠ Coquillat i Llofriu; Casa Amatller, at Passeig de Gr√†cia 41, designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch; and Casa Batll√≥, at Passeig de Gr√†cia 43, designed by Antoni Gaud√≠. Due to the presence of these famous landmark buildings, the block is a significant tourist attraction in Barcelona.

Synopsis The film is based on the massacre Gwangju on May 18, 1980. It occurred when General Chun Doo-hwan tried to eliminate any rebels by using military force. Min-woo (Kim Sang-kyung) leads a relatively peaceful life with his younger brother Jin-woo (Lee Joon-gi)‚Äîuntil the day the soldiers go on the rampage against the citizens. The citizens form a militia determined to protect their loved ones, and Min-woo finds himself in the middle of it all. One day something unexpected happens suddenly. Innocent citizens are assaulted and even killed by martial law army armed with guns and knives. A tear gas rolls into the theater and a college student jumps into the theater, followed by a soldier. When all the people who watched the movie came out, martial law soldiers beat up college students and beat everyone out of the theater. Gwangju citizens, who have lost friends, lovers and family members in front of their eyes in an unjust manner, start to form a civic group centering on Heung-soo (Ahn Sung-ki), who retired officer-turned-military officer, and begin a 10-day struggle. Meanwhile, Jin-woo is angry that his classmate was beaten to death by martial law soldiers when he was not a college student, leading his friends to take the lead in the protest. Min-woo wants to stop his younger brother Jin-woo from taking the lead in the protest. But Jin-woo couldn't stay still, and in the end, Jin-woo was shot in front of Min-woo by martial law soldiers. The governor of South Jeolla Province shows up on a helicopter to citizens in front of the provincial government to mediate between them. The broadcast was about to withdraw martial law troops until the hour of the day, and the civilian forces believe the words and cheer. Gwangju citizens wait for the right time, but the soldiers do not withdraw at the promised time. As the national anthem is played through the speakers of the provincial government building, citizens salute with their right hand on their left chests, while soldiers sit down and prepare to shoot in a posture at the civilians, and then fire away.

It currently broadcasts in all ex-Yugoslav countries (Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo), Albania, Greece, the Middle East and Africa. It originally launched on 2 April 1997 as a Middle Eastern-only channel, but began to roll out in other countries beginning in 2005. It previously used to cover Poland and Turkey with their respective audio tracks until 2010 and 2012 respectively, when two localised feeds were launched for those countries. History The channel was launched on 2 April 1997 on satellite provider Orbit. At first, it was available only in English, but on 1 April 1998, a separate Arabic feed was added. Cartoons were dubbed in Arabic, while the live-action shows and most of live-action movies were subtitled. Disney Channel Middle East was then picked up by satellite provider Showtime in fall 2001. The channel featured the logos (resembling Mickey Mouse head) in two versions (the one with the channel's name written in English and the other in Arabic for each feed) until June 2003 when it adopted the 2002 US Disney Channel logo. The channel was managed by Disney Channel Asia in Singapore until December 2004, when due to a new marketing strategy, it started to be managed from the United Kingdom. Somewhere at that time, both the Arabic and the English feed of the channel were merged. In consequence, on 3 January 2005 Disney Channel Middle East started to simulcast Disney Channel Scandinavia, including its schedule and the prints of the series and movies for this feed (modified to feature also Arabic dub credits). Then on November/December 2005 Disney Channel Scandinavia and Middle East started to add dub credits to the series and movies through subtitles. Disney Channel Scandinavia and Middle East started gradually becoming individual feeds in 2006 starting with different rotation of films (that gets more different as the time goes by), however it didn't stop Arab satellite provider Orbit to add a Swedish audio track to the Middle Eastern feed on 16 April 2007 (that was later removed years later). The Middle Eastern feed became a Pan-European network as the channel was launched in Sub-Saharan Africa on 25 September 2006, in Poland on 2 December 2006, on Turkey on 29 April 2007, in ex-Yugoslav countries and on Greece on 7 November 2009. In fall 2009, when the feed separation from Disney Channel Scandinavia was complete, the Middle East feed (now broadcasting in most of the EMEA region) started to share promotions and events with Disney Channel Central and Eastern Europe. On 1 August 2010, the channel stopped broadcasting in Poland due to the launch of a localised Polish feed of Disney Channel. On 12 January 2012, Disney Channel EMEA stopped broadcasting in Turkey with the launch of a localised Turkish feed of the network. The channel adopted a new logo and underwent a brand design on 21 July 2014. In 2015, Disney Channel EMEA switched its aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9.

HTTP/1.1Key Differences between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 Byte Range Serving; Page on demandbyte serving definition of byte serving in the Free Online Encyclopedia) is the process of sending only a portion of an HTTP/1.1 message from a server to a client. Byte serving begins when an HTTP server advertises its willingness to serve partial requests using the Accept-Ranges response header. A client then requests a specific part of a file from the server using the Range request header. If the range is valid, the server sends it to the client with a 206 Partial Content status code and a Content-Range header listing the range sent. If the range is invalid, the server responds with a 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable status code. Clients which request byte- serving might do so in cases in which a large file has been only partially delivered and a limited portion of the file is needed in a particular range. Byte Serving is therefore a method of bandwidth optimization.Key Differences between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 \\"A typical example is a server's sending an entire (large) resource when the client only needs a small part of it. There was no way in HTTP/1.0 to request partial objects... HTTP/1.1 range requests allow a client to request portions of a resource.\\" In the HTTP/1.0 standard, clients were only able to request an entire document. By allowing byte- serving, clients may choose to request any portion of the resource. One advantage of this capability is when a large media file is being requested, and that media file is properly formatted, the client may be able to request just the portions of the file known to be of interest. This is essential for serving video files; if a server lacks this feature, videos hosted on that server may not be playable until the entire file has been downloaded by the client, and seeking within the file may be disabled. Similarly PDF files can be optimized for byte serving to allow multi-gigabyte files to be instantly viewable in the browser by only requesting the data required to render the current page.Enable Fast Web View in a PDF Byte serving can also be used by multihomed clients to simultaneously download a resource over multiple network interfaces.Enhancing Video-on-Demand Playout over Multiple Heterogeneous Access Networks by D. Kaspar, K. R. Evensen, P. E. Engelstad, A. F. Hansen, P. Halvorsen, and C. Griwodz. In: IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC), , 2010 To achieve this type of application-layer link aggregation, multiple HTTP sessions are established and logical file segments are collaboratively downloaded from the server and reassembled at the client. This allows full utilization of several end-to-end paths and therefore leads to an increased download speed. The use of the Chunked Transfer-Encoding is not byte-serving, but is instead a method in which an HTTP/1.1 server sends the entire resource, but in several separate portions (or chunks) of data. It is often used when a server does not know exactly how much data there will be in the total response, allowing the server to start sending data to the client straight away without having to buffer the response and determine the exact length before it begins sending it to the client. This improves latency and reduces memory requirements while preserving the ability to reuse the connection after the response is completed. Byte serving and chunking are compatible and can be used with or without the other.

Rodrigo de Villandrando (died c. 1457) was a Spanish routier from Castile and mercenary military leader in Gascony during the final phase of the Hundred Years' War. He was famous for his pillaging and was consequently known as the Emperor of Pillagers (empereur des brigands) or L'√âcorcheur (the slaughterer).Quicherat, 140. Originally from Biscay, he was the son of Pedro de Villandrando and Agnes de Corral. He became count of Ribaldo and Valladolid. Around 1410 he arrived in France and was admitted into the company of Amaury de S√©verac. He rose to become captain of the routiers, veritable mercenaries in the pay of the seneschal or various other powerful lords and even bishops. When his protector Amaury died in 1427, he entered the service of Charles VII of France. In 1428 he was joined by Juan Salazar, who became his lieutenant. In his early career he is known to have pillaged Treignac, Meymac, and Tulle. On 11 June 1430 he participated in the Battle of Anthon with around 400 men armed with such prosaic devices as billhooks, sledge hammers, and spades. He participated on the side of the French king against Louis II of Chalon-Arlay, Prince of Orange and a vassal of Philip the Good. In 1431 he was rewarded by John II of Aragon with the county of Ribadeo and the right to eat at his table once a year. That same year he pillaged Saint-Cl√©ment-de-R√©gnat and was employed by the French to put down a peasant rebellion, which he did by massacring the refugees at Saint-Romain-le-Puy. In September 1432 his routiers, in the pay of Georges de la Tr√©moille, held Les Ponts-de-C√© against the assaults of Jean V de Bueil. Around 1433, at the height of his power, he had around 10,000 mercenaries, mostly Englishmen called Rodrigoys, under his command and he was the terror of the countryside of the M√©doc, where his men habitually held the petty lords of the region for ransom and forced protection money from the populace; they were constantly pillaging and ransacking the bastides. In 1433 he took the castle of Lagarde Viaur and held it for a very high ransom. In the late 1430s he pillaged Bor- et-Bar, Salers, and Laparade. On 24 May 1433 he married Margaret, the half- sister of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, and illegitimate daughter of Duke John I. For 6,000 √©cus he bought the castles of Ussel and then Ch√¢teldon from his brother-in-law. Between 1434 and 1439 he was subsequently installed in the fortress of Montgilbert. In 1436 his men pillaged Cordes; in 1438 Lauzun, Fumel, Issigeac, and Blanquefort were hit. In 1437 his men violently despoiled the furriers of Charles VII at H√©risson. In 1438 he joined French forces under Charles II of Albret and Poton de Xaintrailles and embarked on a chevauch√©e in the Bordelais and M√©doc.Labarge, 210. They were stopped only by the walls of Bordeaux itself. In 1440 he fought with Charles of Bourbon against Charles VII in the revolt known as the Praguerie.Quicherat, 290-291. In 1441 Changy and Pavie were pillaged by his men. In 1442 he again had the support of the French king for the depredation of northern Gascony.Lodge, 119. Later that year he and Albret threatened Bazas. In 1443 a party of his men on the command of Salazar returned to Spain, plundering upper Languedoc and the Lauragais on the way. Banned thenceforward from the realm, Rodrigo returned to Spain, where he was made marshal of Castile. He willed his worldly goods to the church of Castile and retired from the world to a monastery, where he died sometime around 1457. Sources *Labarge, Margaret Wade.

Early life Mehroom was born in the village of Mousa Noor Zaman Shah (Mianwali District, Punjab (now Pakistan) on 1 July 1887. The small village, consisting of some 20‚Äì25 homes, was under constant threat of flooding from the Indus River and was destroyed and rebuilt many times before his family gave up their farm and shop and moved to Isakhel. Education At the age of 6/7 years he joined the Vernacular Middle School where he topped the class every year and received scholarships in the 5th & 8th years. He passed the matriculation examination in 1907 attaining a first class certificate from the Diamond Jubilee School, Bannu (there was no high school in Isakhel). Following this, he entered the Central Training College, Lahore where he trained as a teacher and graduated with BA degree. Career In 1908 he joined the Mission High School at Dera Ismail Khan as a teacher of English. Shortly afterwards he transferred to Isakhel for domestic reasons. His concern about the lack of clean water in Isakhel led to his move to Kaloorkote as headmaster of the local middle school in 1924. Following his son's (Jagan Nath Azad's) move to Rawalpindi in 1933 for higher education, Mehroom sought a transfer there and accepted the post of headmaster at the Cantonment Board School. He worked there till 1943. He was the first headmaster of school which is now famous as F.G.Technical High School. Tariq abad (Lalkurti) Rawalpindi. A short time later, he became a lecturer in Urdu and Persian at Gordon College. The partition of India brought his stay in Rawalpindi to an end. He left the College in December 1947 and moved permanently to Delhi, India. He returned to Gordon College in 1953 for its Golden Jubilee celebrations. On arrival in Delhi, he was appointed Editor of Tej Weekly, the literary section of Tej Daily, for a brief period. The Government of India approved Punjab University's (divided at the time of partition of India) proposal to open a college in Delhi to deal with the issue of adult education for refugees. Camp College was established in Hastings School and Mehroom was appointed to the post of Professor of Urdu. He held this post until his retirement in December 1957. Mehroom died on 6 January 1966 after an illness of five weeks. Jagan Nath Azad, his son, donated Mehroom's collection of books to the Allama Iqbal Library, University of Kashmir, where they are now classified as the Tilok Chand Mehroom Collection.http://www.kashmiruniversity.net/divisions.aspx, Poetry There were no libraries in the schools of North West Frontier Province when Mehroom was growing up. With no formal training or instruction and very limited access to literary works, it is remarkable that he developed a love of poetry and achieved acclaim as a poet himself. He found, read eagerly and was inspired by poetry collections of Mirza Ghalib & Mohammad Ibrahim Zauq during his 4 years in Bannu. He wrote simple couplets whilst still at primary school, but it was in Bannu that he started taking his writing seriously. He composed a nazm entitled Khidmat-e-Validain when he was about 12/13 years old. It earned him the praise not only from the Divisional Inspector of Schools but also from the Director of Education. By the time he finished his studies at Diamond Jubilee School (Bannu), his poems were being published in Makhzan (Lahore) and Zamana (Kanpur). Once he moved to Rawalpindi, he became a frequent invitee to the annual mushairas organised by Khwaja Abdul Raheem in Lyallpur (now Faisalabad). Regulars to these mushairas included Jigar Moradabadi and Hafeez Jullundhri among others. After the death of his beloved wife, Mehroom wrote poems reflecting his disenchantment with the ephemerality of life and the instability of relationships. The most famous of these is Ashk-e-Hasrat (part of his collection entitled Toofan-e-Gham). Mehroom's first major publication was Ganj-e-Ma'ani which contained a rich variety of 175 nazms as well as many rubais, qasidas, sehras, and nohas. Poets and literary critics like Niaz Fatehpuri, Muhammad Iqbal, Firaq Gorakhpuri, Kaifi Azmi, Josh Malsiani and Ejaz Hussain have admired his poetry. https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL5271789A/Tilok_Chand_Mehroom Ethics and views Born in a Hindu family, Mehroom grew up in a predominantly Muslim community. This mix of cultures in his early years was greatly influential on his thinking. When his daughter Shakuntala died, her remains were buried (Muslim manner), not cremated (Hindu way). He gave precedence to \\"the man\\" over \\"his religion\\". When he died, his pall-bearers were two Hindus, one Muslim & one Sikh, and the Dasween (ceremony performed on the 10th day after death) included recitals from the Vedas & Bhagavad Gita (Hindu), the Qur'an (Muslim) and Sukhmani Sahib (Sikh). Mehroom was not a political activist but, as with much literature of this period, some of his poems reflect the political unrest in the country. His friendship with Allama Sir Muhammad Iqbal did not dissuade him from disagreeing with Allama's proposals for India's independence at the Round Table Conference in London. Honours and awards The annual Sahitya Samaroh (literary convention) of the Government of Punjab, India dedicated its 1962 session to Mehroom for his \\"services to literature\\" and presented him with a robe of honour, a testimonial and a purse. (Forty- five years earlier, the contemporary Government of Punjab had awarded him a cash prize for his service to literature.).

Commissioner is a case heard by the United States Tax Court in 1967. Issues #Whether the value of a 1962 Chevrolet Corvette won by Paul Hornung (taxpayer) for his performance in the 1961 National Football League championship game should be included in his gross income for the taxable year 1962; #Whether the value of the use of the 1962 Thunderbird automobiles furnished to Hornung by Ford should be included in gross income for the taxable year 1962; #Whether Hornung's gross income for 1962 should include the value of a fur stole received by his mother from his employer. Facts =Pertaining to the 1962 Corvette (Issue 1)= Sport Magazine annually awarded a new Corvette to the outstanding player in the National Football League championship game. The 1961 National Football League Championship was played on Sunday, December 31, 1961 in Green Bay, Wisconsin between the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants. Paul Hornung scored a record 19 points in the game, helping the Packers win the championship 37-0.Packers Wayback Machine as of April 1, 2009 Sport Magazine informed Hornung after the game that he had been declared Sport Magazine's outstanding player, and that as the most outstanding player, Hornung was awarded a 1962 Corvette. On December 31, the Corvette was physically in New York City, where Sport Magazine‚Äôs offices were located. The editor in chief of Sport Magazine did not have the key or the title of the Corvette with him in Green Bay, nor did Hornung request immediate possession of the car at the time the award was accepted. Sport considered the car available to Hornung as soon as the award was announced, though Sport had not made any arrangements to have the car ready for Hornung on December 31, and Hornung did not actually receive the car until January 3, 1962 at an awards luncheon in New York. Hornung was not required to attend this luncheon or perform any other services in order to receive the vehicle. The fair market value of the Corvette was $3,331.04. Hornung sold the vehicle and reported this sale on his 1962 Federal income tax return. However, he did not include the fair market value of the car in his tax return for 1962 or any other year. =Pertaining to the 1962 Thunderbirds (Issue 2)= In July 1962, Hornung asked a friend to arrange for a car to be available for him to drive while in Green Bay. A local Ford dealership furnished Hornung with a 1962 Thunderbird, later exchanging the original for a second 1962 Thunderbird. The title to the cars remained with Ford, though Hornung paid the insurance and all operating costs while driving the Thunderbirds. Hornung was not asked to make any personal appearances or special efforts for the dealership, except that he was asked to \\"come in and say hi\\" during a Ford-sponsored children's football event. Ford had also furnished other Green Bay Packers with vehicles for their use around Green Bay. Hornung did not recognize or report any income associated with this use. The value of this use was determined to be $600. =Pertaining to the Fur Stole (Issue 3)= After winning the Western Division title of the National Football League in 1961, Vince Lombardi bought and distributed fur stoles to the wives, friends, and mothers of each player on the team. Hornung's mother received the stole in 1961. The stoles were reported by the Packers as \\"Other Unallowable Deductions\\" and were described as \\"Awards to players' wives, etc.\\" The stoles were valued at $395 per stole, less an 8-percent bulk discount. Hornung did not report any gross income with respect to the stole given to his mother. Analysis =Pertaining to the 1962 Corvette (Issue 1)= Hornung argued both that the Corvette was a gift and therefore exempt from federal income tax, and alternatively that it was constructively received by him in 1961, and therefore was not subject to federal income tax in the year of 1962. The court first addressed Hornung's second argument. Under section 451 of the Internal Revenue Code, \\"the amount of any item of gross income shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer ...\\" 26 U.S.C. 451 Under the cash receipts method, which Hornung had appropriately utilized, items constituting gross income are to be included for the taxable year in which they are actually or constructively received. The court noted that an item is constructively received when it has been set apart for the taxpayer or otherwise made available for him to draw upon, if the intention to do so is known. But \\"income is not constructively received if the taxpayer's control of its receipt is subject to substantial limitations or restrictions.\\" The court found that on Sunday, December 31, 1961, there were substantial limitations or restrictions on Hornung‚Äôs control over the Corvette. At that time, the car was physically in the state of New York, and the editor in chief of Sport Magazine had neither keys nor title to the vehicle to give to Hornung to establish his possession. Additionally, because December 31, 1961 was a Sunday, the dealership where the car was kept was closed, and Hornung could not have accessed it on that date even if he wanted to. Based on the above, the Tax Court held that the constructive receipt doctrine was inapplicable and the Corvette was received by Hornung for income tax purposes in 1962. After the Court established that the car has been received in 1962, it turned to a determination of whether it should be included in gross income for that year, specifically addressing Hornung's \\"gift\\" argument. The court determined that the Corvette was not given as a gift because Sport Magazine had a motive for giving it beyond a 'detached and disinterested generosity' (a requisite for a judicial finding of a 'gift'). The court held that the Corvette clearly qualified as a prize or award under section 74(a) of the tax code (26 U.S.C. 74(a)). The court held that the Corvette did not qualify for any exceptions under section 74(b), and thus was gross income to Hornung. The court dismissed Hornung's claims that the championship football game constitutes an educational, artistic, scientific, or civic achievement. The court reaffirmed the principle that words in the revenue acts should be interpreted in their ordinary, everyday sense. The court believed the exceptions articulated in 74(b) refer to \\"activities enhancing in one way or another the public good.\\" =Pertaining to the 1962 Thunderbirds (Issue 2)= Hornung argued that the use of the Thunderbirds was a gift under section 102, since he was not obligated to perform any services to use the cars. The court focused on the dealership's intentions in making the loan, and determined that Hornung had not sufficiently proven that the loaned cars were given as a result of 'detached and disinterested generosity.' The court then considered whether the economic benefit to Hornung was gross income. Relying on the test provided in Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., the court found that the benefit was an undeniable accession to wealth, clearly realized, and over which Hornung had complete dominion; and therefore was taxable gross income under section 61 of the tax code. =Pertaining to the Fur Stole (Issue 3)= The court dispensed of this issue easily by noting that the stole was actually received by Hornung's mother in 1961.; see also ; 26 U.S.C. 61(a) Therefore, it did not constitute income in 1962. Holding =Pertaining to the 1962 Corvette (Issue 1)= Hornung did not, for income tax purposes, constructively receive the Corvette in 1961, but rather received it in 1962. Because the Corvette was received in 1962, and not excludable from taxable income as a gift or applicable award or prize, the Tax Court held that the value of the car should have been included in Hornung‚Äôs gross income for 1962. =Pertaining to the 1962 Thunderbirds (Issue 2)= The court found that Hornung had not met the burden of proving his use of the Thunderbirds was a gift. Therefore, the economic benefit he received was taxable gross income. =Pertaining to the Fur Stoles (Issue 3)= The stole was not income to Hornung in 1962, as it was actually received in 1961.

In 1902 Francesca Morera assigned Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner to remodel ancient \\"casa Rocamora\\", built in 1864. She died in 1904, and the building was named after her son, Albert Lle√≥ i Morera. The building is located on the corner of Carrer del Consell de Cent, and is one of the three important buildings of Barcelona's Illa de la Disc√≤rdia (\\"Block of Discord\\"), and it is the only building of the block awarded Barcelona's town council's Arts Building Annual Award (Concurso anual de edificios art√≠sticos), obtained in 1906. Other buildings such as Casa Calvet and Casa Trinxet were awarded the same prize between 1899 and 1906 The building lost some of its most representative elements, such as the tempietto on its top (now restored) and the ground floor and mezzanine's architectural sculpture. The building is also known as the residence of Cuban-Catalan photographer Pau Audouard.Casa Lleo-Morera at Tot Passejant (Spanish)  The building  The building was not only the result of an architectural project, but ‚Äîcommon practice in Catalan modernism architecture‚Äî, several artists collaborated with Dom√®nech i Montaner so as to make a complete artwork, inspired in natural and organic motifs: Llu√≠s Bru and Mario Maragliano were responsible of the mosaic work, Eusebi Arnau made the sculptures, Antoni Serra i Fiter elaborated the ceramics, and Gaspar Homar designed the decoration and the furniture.Illustration of the entrance. It has been considered that Morera's family wanted to leave trace of their lineage with the continuous references to their family name (Morera, which means mulberry tree in English) in the decoration. Some examples are the mulberry tree found in the patio, the mulberry motifs of the door handles or the portraits made by Antoni Serra in the second floor. The fa√ßade and ground floor of the building were decorated with big and varied modernist ornaments, with some outstanding sculptures by Eusebi Arnau surrounding the entrance, which represented two couples of feminine figures holding vases. Those sculptures were installed on double pairs of columns made of pink marble, and under the gallery of the first floor, other feminine heads could be found. On the first floor, aside the windows, two couples of feminine figures can also be found, showing several objects related to the technological improvements made in that period, such as the phonograph, electricity, telephone and photography. Barcelona's official chronicler Llu√≠s Permanyer stated that this building is like \\"a scaled Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana.\\" The building has been considered one of the best examples of modernisme architecture, but Noucentisme supporters performed several modifications to the original structure. In 1943, Raimon Duran i Reynals signed a refurbishing project for the ground floor, designed by Francisco Ferrer Bartolom√© according to an assignment by Loewe so as to open a store. This project included the disappearance of the modernist windows and the ground floor feminine modernist plant boxes made by Eusebi Arnau, which were destroyed on the sidewalk using picks. The building caretaker later recovered the feminine heads, which were sold to Salvador Dal√≠, who installed them in Figuere's Teatre-Museu Dal√≠'s patio. In the mid-1980s, architect √íscar Tusquets was commissioned to restore the building. The pinnacles and the tempietto at the top of the structure, severely damaged by machine guns during the Spanish civil war were restored, and the ground floor damage was partially recovered. The building underwent another restoration process in 1992, and was bought by Grupo N√∫√±ez y Navarro in 2006, responsible for another restoration operation. In 2007 the building was put on the Art Nouveau European Route. In April 2012 the most recent restoration project was completed, focused on the ground floor. Several elements such as the carriage entrance, several columns and some mosaics were recovered.

Isaac Low, John Alsop, James Duane, Philip Livingston, and John Jay were then appointed, and the public of the City and County was invited to attend City Hall and concur in the appointments on July 7.

Albany County had appointed delegates of its own, but the New York County delegates were ultimately authorized to act in their stead. In Westchester County, meetings were held in the towns of Bedford, Mamaronee, Rye, and Westchester, and on August 22 a general county meeting at White Plains authorized the New York County delegates to act for the county. The action of Duchess County is not very clear. Henry Wisner and John Haring were appointed on August 16 by the General Meeting of all the Committees of the County of Orange. As told by Joseph Galloway, a delegate from Pennsylvania, the appointment for the Kings County (now Brooklyn) delegate was made thusly: two persons assembled; one was made chairman, the other clerk; and the latter certified to the congress that the former, Simon Boerum, was unanimously chosen for the county of Kings. For Suffolk County, less is known about the appointment of William Floyd. In three meetings held in Ulster County, the New York County delegates were authorized to act for those present, if not the whole county; it's not usually included with Albany, Duchess, and Westchester because congress received no credentials from that county authorizing the New York County delegates to act for it. The First Continental Congress met from September 5 to October 26, 1774. Previous to this committee's formation, opposition to the British was organized through the informal leadership of the Sons of Liberty. From late 1774, the Committee exercised effective control of New York City, and declared that Boston was \\"suffering in defence of the rights of America\\". Committee of Sixty On November 22, 1774 the Committee of Fifty-One and the Committee of Mechanics nominated a committee of inspection that was approved by the freeholders and freemen of the city at City Hall (about 30-40 people showed, according to Lt. Gov. Cadwallader Colden), known variously as the Committee of Sixty and/or the Committee of Observation, to carry the measures of the First Continental Congress into effect, i.e. the Continental Association, pursuant to the 11th resolution of the Congress. This Committee issued a call to the counties of New York on March 15, 1775 to send delegates to a Provincial Convention in New York City on April 20, to elect delegates to the Second Continental Congress. On April 23, news of the battle of Lexington and Concord arrived. On April 26, Isaac Low called for the dismissal of the Committee of Sixty and the convening of a Provincial Congress, as well as a Committee of One Hundred to perform the function of the Provincial Congress until it was convened. On April 29, 1775 a mass meeting of residents signed a \\"General Association\\" whereby they agreed to obey the Continental Congress, the Committee of Sixty, and New York's Provincial Convention. Committee of One Hundred The Committee of Sixty was replaced by a more representative Committee of One Hundred on May 1, 1775. By May 4, the city had four companies of volunteers. On May 15, the Continental Congress ordered the construction of a fort at Kings Bridge, the construction of batteries in the Highlands, and the arming and training of a militia. The Committee of One Hundred still considered itself loyal to the British Crown, but was instead opposed to the laws of the Parliament of Great Britain which they considered unconstitutional because they had no representation in it. The committee wrote to Governor Cadwallader Colden in May, 1775 \\"that though they are arming with the greatest diligence and industry; it is not with design to oppose, but to strengthen government in the due exercise of constitutional authority\\".Launitz-Schurer, pg. 160 In May, all inhabitants were asked to sign an Association. Anyone who refused to sign were to be called \\"enemies of this country\\". Some of the Loyalists were tarred and feathered. The committee disarmed all loyalists within its jurisdiction. The Committee of One Hundred was officially replaced by the New York Provincial Congress which first convened on May 23, 1775, but the committee continued to meet for a while.

The code is made up of statutes which govern the general obligations and rights of persons within the jurisdiction of California. It was based on a civil code originally prepared by David Dudley Field II for the state of New York (but which was never enacted in that state). It is one of the 29 California Codes and was among the first four enacted in 1872. Organization Though the Code is organized in a manner similar to many civil law civil codes, many of its provisions are codifications of well- established common law principles. For example, it contains a definition of consideration, a principle in the common law of contracts which has no direct equivalent in civil law systems. Similarly, it codifies the mailbox rule that communication of acceptance is effective when dropped in the mail, which is a feature unique to the common law. First adopted in 1872 and signed into law by then Governor Newton Booth, the Civil Code is divided ‚Äì similarly to its civil law analogues ‚Äì into four divisions: \\"the first relating to persons\\"; \\"the second to property\\"; \\"the third to obligations\\"; \\"the fourth contains general provisions relating to the three preceding divisions.\\" Division One contains laws which govern personal rights while Division Two contains laws which govern property rights. Division Three codifies the substantive contract law of the State of California as well as various regulations relating to agency, mortgages, unsecured loans, extensions of credit, and other areas of California law. Division Four defines remedies available in lawsuits, what constitutes a nuisance, various maxims of jurisprudence, and other miscellaneous provisions which relate \\"to the three preceding divisions.\\" Although revolutionary for its time, the California Civil Code was actually the third successfully enacted codification of the substance of the common law. The first was the Code of Georgia of 1861 (largely based on the work of Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb independent of Field), which is the ancestor of today's Official Code of Georgia Annotated. Then Dakota Territory beat California to the punch by becoming the first jurisdiction to enact Field's civil code in 1866. Reaction David Dudley Field II's audacity in trying to codify all of the general principles of the common law (including the law of property, domestic relations, contracts, and torts) into general statutory law in the form of a civil code was extremely controversial in the American legal community, both in his time and ever since. Most U.S. states (as well as most other common law jurisdictions) declined to pursue such an aggressive codification. The Restatements of the Law were developed in the 20th century as a compromise between those who felt the common law was a disorganized mess and those who valued the flexibility and richness of the common law. Only California, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana enacted virtually all of Field's civil code, while Idaho partially enacted the contract sections but omitted the tort sections. Later, Guam borrowed much of the California Civil Code for its own legal system. Justice Stephen Johnson Field (who was David Field's brother and was largely responsible for introducing his work to California), praised the California Codes (including the Civil Code) as \\"perfect in their analysis, admirable in their arrangement, and furnishing a complete code of laws,\\"Maurice E. Harrison, First Half-Century of the California Civil Code, 10 Cal. L. Rev. 185 (1922). while English jurist Sir Frederick Pollock attacked the Civil Code as \\"about the worst piece of codification ever produced\\" and called it \\"the New York abortion\\" (since it was never enacted in that state). Subsequent developments Over the years, the Civil Code has been repeatedly amended by legislation and initiative measures. A very significant change to the Civil Code occurred in June 1992 when nearly all of the Civil Code's provisions relating to marriage, community property, and other family law matters were removed from the Civil Code (at the suggestion of the California Law Revision Commission) and re-enacted in the form of a new Family Code. The California Family Code went into effect on January 1, 1994. Most statutes that deal with civil procedure are codified in a separate code, the California Code of Civil Procedure.

Orlando Weekly has also taken a decidedly critical stance on controversial Republican Florida Gov.

She attained arahantship faster than any other nun and lived in the 6th century BCE in what is now Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in India.  Early years  She was born \\"Bhadda\\" in Rajagaha, the capital city of the kingdom of Magadha of King Bimbisara. Bhadda‚Äôs well-heeled parents were very protective of her, because she had a passionate nature and they were afraid that she end up hurt due to her strong attraction to men. One day, she saw a thief being led to the place of his execution through the window of her home. He was the son of a Brahmin, but had a long history of theft. Bhadda fell in love with him at first sight. She was able to convince her father that she could not live without him, and so he bribed the jail wardens who let the condemned man break out of the prison. The couple were married, and soon after, the groom became strongly preoccupied with acquiring his wife's jewelry. He told Bhadda that he had vowed to make offerings to a certain mountain deity if he could avoid the death penalty. He managed to get Bhadda away from his home using this pretext. He wanted to push her over a high cliff to steal her valuable ornaments. When they arrived at the precipice, he told her about his intention. In her distress, Bhadda resolved to a ruse that enabled her to push him to his death.  Jain ascetic  Weighed down from the guilt arising from the murder of her husband, Bhadda did not want to return to lay life. Sensual pleasures and possessions no longer captured her attention and she became a wandering ascetic. She entered the order of Jains as an ascetic. As a special penance, her hair was torn out at the roots when she was ordained. Her hair grew again and it was very curly, giving her the name Kundalakesa (Curly-hair). Bhadda Kundalakesa was not satisfied by the Jain doctrine, so she became a solitary wandering ascetic. For fifty years she traveled throughout Ancient India and visited many spiritual teachers, thereby accruing a wide-ranging knowledge of religious scriptures and philosophies. With her knowledge, she became one of the foremost debaters of her time. Whenever she entered a town, she would make a sand-pile and stick a rose-apple branch into it. This would challenge whoever was interested in a debate to trample upon the sand-pile.  Debate with Sariputra  One day she visited Savatthi and again erected her sand pile. At the time, Sariputra, one of the two chief disciples of the Buddha, and the disciple with the greatest power of analysis, was staying at the Jetavana monastery in the city. He heard of Bhadda‚Äôs arrival, and as a sign of his willingness to debate, he sent several children to trample on the sand- pile. Bhadda then went to Jetavana, Anathapindika's monastery, followed by a large throng of spectators. She was supremely confident of victory, since she had become accustomed to winning all debates as a matter of course. Bhadda posed a number of questions to Sariputra. He answered all of them until she could not think of any more questions. Then it was Sariputra‚Äôs turn to question her. His first question affected Bhadda profoundly, which was \\"What is the One?\\" Bhadda remained silent, intrigued by what he was inquiring about. She could have answered \\"God\\" or \\"Brahma\\" or \\"the Infinite\\", which would have been the good answer. But Bhadda decided not to formulate an answer and thereby lost the debate, because she knew that she had found what she had been searching for half a century of wandering around India. She chose Sariputra as her teacher, but he referred her to Gautama Buddha. He expounded the dharma to her at Mount Vulture Peak and finished with the following verses: Just as the wanderer Bahiya was the bhikkhu who attained arahantship faster than anyone else, Bhadda was the fastest among the bhikkhunis. Both grasped the essence of the Buddha‚Äôs teaching so quickly and so deeply that their ordination in the sangha came after their attainment of arahantship. Their mind and emotional self-control had long been trained and prepared, so their attainment came very quickly.

The other timeline follows an Australian boy named Vinnie Santani, and is set in the present day. Plot introduction Taking place during World War II, Fireshadow follows two seventeen-year-old boys. Erich Pieters joins the German Wehrmacht to fight for Chancellor Adolf Hitler in 1941, and winds up in an Australian Prisoner of War camp after fighting in North Africa. Half a century later, Vinnie Santiani flees into the remote Australian Bush in an effort to cope with the death of his sister. Despite the fact that they live in different times, the boys' lives intertwine in the novel with haunting results. A reviewer for Magpies commented that the award-winning book's \\"language is exceptional throughout ... while the author's insights into the emotional lives of the young people are sensitively conveyed.\\" The main character is Erich Pieters who is only 17 years of age. The novel doesn't provide much of a physical description of him but is does provide a good description of his personality. Erich grew up in a small family of a mother, father and younger sister. His father wasn't around much when he was younger as he was an army officer who worked for Hitler. When the war started (Erich was only 17 at the time) Erich signed up for the army to the disapproval of his mother and sister but not his father. His father was a very proud man and Erich took after him. Soon after Erich went to war, he was captured and sent to Australia to a prisoner of war camp. As he developed into a man, he became less proud and his personality developed as he tried to overcome his adversity of adapting to such different surroundings and treatment.

A goal- kicking , he gained a high level of prominence in the sport in England by playing for Hull Kingston Rovers (captain) and Castleford, as well as representing Great Britain. Millward was awarded the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1983. Nicknamed ‚ÄúRoger the Dodger‚Äù for his elusive running, he was inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame in 2000. Early life Millward was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. Domestic career Millward began his professional career in September 1964, signing for his home town club Castleford. He made his d√©but on 3 October 1964 against Dewsbury Celtic, and won his first domestic honours in 1965 with Castleford picking up the Floodlit Trophy. Millward played in the position of and, due to the importance of such a position in rugby league, and due to the fact there were many more experienced players in the Castleford side at that time (such as Alan Hardisty and Keith Hepworth) Millward found it hard to break into the first team for any length of time. Millward played in Castleford's victory in the Yorkshire County League during the 1964‚Äì65 season. Despite his lack of game experience, the international selectors were interested in Millward and picked him to play for the Great Britain team in March 1966 against France at the age of 18 and one of Great Britain's youngest players. Millward played in Castleford's 4‚Äì0 victory over St. Helens in the 1965 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final during the 1965‚Äì66 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens on Tuesday 14 December 1965. On 8 August 1966 Millward was transferred from Castleford to Hull Kingston Rovers for a fee of ¬£6,000, (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£185,900 in 2013) and he made his d√©but for Hull Kingston Rovers at Hunslet on 15 August 1966 and helped the club win the Yorkshire County Cup, and retain it in the 1967 season. In the 1968 season Millward finished as the top try scorer for Hull Kingston Rovers with a total of 38 tries in that season, picking up the supporters' player of the year award. Due to his good form he was awarded a call up to the Great Britain squad for the 1968 World Cup which Britain lost to Australia. In 1969 at the age of 21 Millward was given the captaincy of Hull Kingston Rovers, and was also voted the supporters' player of the year for the second time as well as being honoured with the title of Rugby League Players No 6 \\"Player of the Year\\". In the mid-1970s Hull Kingston Rovers had become a dominant force in the world of rugby league thanks in part to Millward's playmaking abilities. Although Hull Kingston Rovers were now one of the top clubs in British rugby league the major awards eluded Millward during his career at Hull Kingston Rovers with just two more Yorkshire Cup winner's medals (1971‚Äì72, 1974‚Äì75) and a runner's up medal (1975‚Äì76) along with two more supporters' player of the year awards (1974‚Äì75, 1975‚Äì76). In Millward's testimonial year he managed to set a new record for Hull Kingston Rovers with the most tries scored in a season, scoring 160 tries in total. In the 1976 close season Millward decided to go and play for an Australian club, Cronulla-Sutherland. Millward made 14 appearances during his time in Sydney, and scored one try as well as kicking 17 points for the then struggling club before returning to Hull. In 1977 Millward was named as player-coach of Hull Kingston Rovers after the unfortunate death of the club's former manager Harry Poole. Millward played , and was the coach in Hull Kingston Rovers' 26‚Äì11 victory over St. Helens in the 1977 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final during the 1977‚Äì78 season at Craven Park, Hull on Tuesday 13 December 1977. He was again voted the supporters' player of the season. This then started a period of total domination for Hull Kingston Rovers. In the 1978‚Äì79 season Hull Kingston Rovers were crowned Division One Champions (the first since 1925). In the 1979‚Äì80 season Millward and his Hull Kingston Rovers side made it to Wembley to play cross-city rivals Hull F.C. in the Challenge Cup Final, despite breaking his jaw midway through the first half, Millward continued and was awarded the trophy at the end of the game.

Millward retired from rugby league a year after the historic challenge cup victory whilst playing for Hull Kingston Rovers' A Team against a Batley A Team. This was Millward's return to action after sustaining a broken jaw in the Challenge Cup Final victory but he was hit by a Batley player and sustained another broken jaw, his fourth in ten months.

International career By 1969, Millward had established himself as a full Great Britain international after his d√©but at 18 years of age playing , in the 4‚Äì8 defeat by France at Central Park, Wigan on 5 March 1966, he went on to make 47 appearances for Great Britain, including 29 Tests. Millward went on tour with Great Britain a total of five times and also toured with the England National Team on one occasion, captaining in both World Cup tournaments. Millward‚Äôs international career was important as he was an integral member of Great Britain‚Äôs last Ashes winning Tour to Australia in 1970 and the last time any series was won against the Australians. Millward played in the 1967 Test Series against the Kangaroo tourists in Britain, and the 1968 World Cup, both campaigns being unsuccessful. However, his finest hour as an international came in the Great Britain touring party of 1970. He was overlooked in favour of former Castleford club mate Alan Hardisty for the first Test against the Australians. The Great Britain team was heavily beaten 37‚Äì15 and wholesale changes were made for the 2nd Test. Millward was drafted into the side, where he gave a superb match winning performance scoring 20 points (2 tries, 7 goals) in a 28‚Äì7 win to square the series. This equalled the match points record for an individual against the Australians, which had previously been set by Lewis Jones. The third Test decider was also successful and the Ashes regained. The 21‚Äì17 score did not reflect Great Britain‚Äôs superiority as they scored five tries to one, but were heavily penalised by the referee. Again, Millward rose to the occasion: with approximately five-minutes to go he scored the match and series winning try on the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). The try resulted from a thrust through the middle by the second rows, first by Jimmy Thompson, and then a bust by Doug Laughton, who then delivered a brilliant pass to Millward in space; Millward took the pass at pace and in turn then outstripped the opposition defence in an arcing run of over 40-yards to score. He also kicked three goals in the game. Thereafter, Millward played with distinction for Great Britain in various internationals against the other nations, but a winning series against the Australians proved elusive. During the 1978 Kangaroo tour Millward captained Great Britain from in all three Test matches of the Ashes series which Australia won 2‚Äì1. Coaching After retiring, Millward stayed on the coaching staff at Hull Kingston Rovers throughout the 1980s, and early 1990s, and guided his team to another Challenge Cup Final and the Yorkshire Cup Final in the 1980‚Äì81 season, losing both matches but they did manage a Premiership trophy. Millward coached Hull Kingston Rovers to the John Player Trophy Final which they lost and second in the Division One Championship. Millward was later awarded an MBE by the Queen for services to rugby league and sport in Great Britain. Roger Millward was the coach in Hull Kingston Rovers' 9‚Äì18 defeat by Widnes in the 1980‚Äì81 Challenge Cup Final during the 1980‚Äì81 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 2 May 1981, in front of a crowd of 92,496, and was the coach in the 14‚Äì15 defeat by Castleford in the 1983‚Äì84 Challenge Cup Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Wembley Stadium, London, on Saturday 3 May 1986, in front of a crowd of 82,134. Roger Millward was the coach in Hull Kingston Rovers' 3‚Äì13 defeat by Hull F.C. in the 1979 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final during the 1979‚Äì80 season at the Boulevard, Hull on Tuesday 18 December 1979. Roger Millward was the coach in Hull Kingston Rovers' 7‚Äì8 defeat by Leeds in the 1980‚Äì81 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1980‚Äì81 season at Fartown, Huddersfield on Saturday 8 November 1980, and was the coach in the 12‚Äì29 defeat by Hull F.C. in the 1984‚Äì85 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Boothferry Park, Hull on Saturday 27 October 1984. During the 1983‚Äì84 season Hull Kingston Rovers dominated the scene with Millward's leadership, winning the League Championship as well as the Premiership to be the first team to complete the double and were rightfully crowned the 'Rugby League Team of the Year'. The 1984‚Äì85 season was almost as historic with victories in the John Player Trophy Final and being crowned Division One Champions for the fifth time, but lost out on the Premiership Final . In 1984‚Äì85 Millward coached his side to the last major final of his tenure. The club were victorious in the Yorkshire Cup Final but were defeated in the John Player Trophy and Challenge Cup Finals which consequently saw the end of Hull Kingston Rovers' domination of English rugby league. Millward left the club after its relegation to Division Two. By 2009 Hull Kingston Rovers had revived its fortunes, riding high in 4th place in the Super League, and regularly fills the new Craven Park, and the Roger Millward Stand. In 1991 Roger, took the coaching job at Halifax, but was only there 17 months before resigning. Genealogical information Roger Millward's marriage to Carol A. (n√©e Bailey) was registered during third ¬º 1968 in Barkston Ash district, they had children; Kay Millward (birth registered during fourth ¬º in Barkston Ash district), and they lived in Kippax, near Leeds. Millward was most recently employed as a Premises Manager by Royds Specialist Language College, near Rothwell Sports Centre. Despite removing all ties from rugby league after leaving Hull Kingston Rovers he attended rugby league matches, mainly those involving his home town club Castleford. Roger Millward was son of William Millward, and Ivy Lockwood (marriage registered during first ¬º 1939 in Pontefract district), was the younger brother of Roy Millward (birth registered during fourth ¬º 1939 in Pontefract district), and was the cousin of the rugby league footballer, and coach, Brian Lockwood. In 2007 Millward had an operation to remove a cancerous growth in the jaw. Following his death Hull Kingston Rovers retired the number 6 from the team jersey. A jersey bearing the number was presented to his family at the game against Widnes on 15 May 2016. Legacy Millward made 406 appearances for Hull Kingston Rovers in total, with 207 tries, over 600 goals and a grand total of 1,825 points making him the third highest points scorer in Hull Kingston Rovers' history. Millward holds the club's record of 207 tries (which beat the previous record set in the 1920s by Gilbert Austin by nearly 50 tries) and has also scored a total of eleven hat tricks for Hull Kingston Rovers, with one for Castleford and two for Great Britain as well as kicking more than ten goals per match. In 2016, it was announced that Hull's Garrison Road would be renamed Roger Millward Way, and a renaming ceremony was held in January 2018.

It presently consists of 12 buildings, 10 of which were built before 1931. The camp was originally designed by Reid's niece, Ella Spencer Reid, who also named the camp. It was begun on land that was leased; Mildred Phelps Stokes Hooker (1881‚Äì1970), daughter of Anson Phelps Stokes, in her Camp Chronicles, sniffs that \\"she seems to have built before she owned.\\" Hooker, p. 12 The land was purchased by the Reids in 1890. The main lodge of unpeeled cedar logs, called the Living Room, was designed by McKim, Mead and White, and is the only known example of a rustic design from that firm. It was added in 1917 after a fire damaged earlier structures; it features sitting and billiard rooms overlooking the lake. The \\"Bishop's Palace\\", a small log octagon set at the water's edge with a massive fireplace and chimney, was named for its occasional use by Episcopalian clerics; there are two other, similar buildings at the camp, all designed by William Rutherford Mead. There is also a guest cottage with eight bedrooms, two boathouses and a recreation hall. The main buildings are connected by stone walkways. Many of the furnishings are original. The camp is still owned by descendants of the original owners. It was included in a multiple property submission for listing on the National Register of Historic Places and was listed in 1986.

It was used as a private girls' camp from the mid-1940s to the mid-1980s. It was sold in 1986, and is now a privately owned summer residence. Built for Connecticut governor Phineas C. Lounsbury in 1883, its design bears the influence of William West Durant. Its main buildings were nearly identical with those of two other nearby camps built in 1880, Camp Fairview, built on Osprey Island by cousin C. W Durant Jr., and The Cedars, built by cousin Frederick Durant on nearby Forked Lake. Neither is still standing, though they are preserved in photographs by Seneca Ray Stoddard and Edward Bierstadt (elder brother of Albert Bierstadt). Like other Durant camps, Echo Camp is built of locally felled logs, with separate buildings for each function. The main lodge consists of a one-floor log hall flanked by twin two- story log towers, giving a villa-like appearance. Interiors are sheathed in polished planks and narrow wainscoting, rooms are lightened by large, half- round clerestory windows, and twig work decorates verandas and eves. Some buildings have applied cedar bark sheathing, still remarkably intact.

Plot The Saunders family has just moved from Los Angeles to Edmonton right before Christmas leaving them with no Christmas spirit with the exception of the bright eyed 6-year-old Mary (Amy and Zoe Schalgel). They go to the majestic West Edmonton Mall for Christmas shopping. The boys find out that Wayne (Patrick Swayze) had been fired from his job and Christmas might not happen this year. He leaves 16-year-old Danny (Cameron Bright) in charge of Mary and 12-year-old Brian (Matthew Knight). Mary tells Santa (Matthew Walker) that she wants a million dollars for Christmas for Wayne, although she doesn't know he was fired. She also says the same thing to \\"Rudolph\\" the reindeer and Brian tells her that if she wanders off again, the \\"Mall Ghost\\" will eat her. They then go to the ice rink. Meanwhile, Leonard (Chris Kattan) and Sheldon Cardoza (Preston Lacy) are talking about using counterfeit money to get real money in exchange. They have a whole bag full of it. In an argument, Leonard accidentally knocks it off the ledge and onto the ice rink. Brian and Mary find it and not knowing that it contains counterfeit money, leave to go on a shopping spree. Mary thinks Santa gave it to her as an early present. Ginger Peachum (Carmen Electra) goes to Leonard and Sheldon and gets mad at them for losing it. They go to the ice rink to find Brian and Mary but they have already left. They then have a montage of trying to find them in different places even though they are right beneath their noses. They buy a motorcycle while Wayne is having a tough time buying a gift for his wife, Judy (Rachel Hayward), who is still in Los Angeles after getting bumped. In the backroom, Gordon McLoosh (Tim Curry) from the RCMP comes to investigate the case of how counterfeit money is appearing all over the mall with the story of two kids claiming that they won the lottery. They find the address where they want the motorcycle to be delivered. They go there and, seeing all the unpacked boxes everywhere, think they are going to move (which is odd, considering they just got there). They find a family photo and use it as evidence. They then search the mall for Wayne, thinking he is the one behind all the counterfeit money. Now, everyone has a crisis. Brian and Mary are spending counterfeit money, Wayne is being unknowingly tracked down for nothing and is having troubles buying a gift for Judy, Danny can't find Brian or Mary at Santa's Village, and Leonard and Sheldon are looking for them. However, Danny goes to the amusement park to find them and finally meets the girl from the water park, and she invites him to some Booster Juice. They learn they have everything in common such as both being from Los Angeles, both hating Edmonton, her name is Shane (which was his girlfriend's name in Los Angeles) and missing younger siblings. At LAX Airport, Judy is stuck waiting for her plane. There, she meets Kristopher Kringle (Walker) who informs her that he got bumped too and that she shouldn't worry because \\"things always work themselves out one way or another\\". He then leaves to board his plane and shocks her after he knows her name. After leaving the bar, Wayne gets arrested by Gordon but even though he explains that he is innocent, Gordon thinks otherwise. Brian and Mary witness this and after he explains what happened to her, Leonard and Sheldon finally catch up to and chase them. They bump into Ginger but Brian finds out that Leonard and Sheldon work for her and run away again. Elsewhere, Wayne is getting interrogated but still has no idea what is going on. Brian and Mary dodge Leonard and Sheldon and ditch the bag on a mannequin. They lead Leonard and Sheldon into the mall's back hallways. They get scared after seeing the shadow of a wolf and get locked in another room with Leonard. Mary runs one way and Brian runs the other. Leonard goes for Brian, who leads him up to the top of the shark tank and Leonard is right behind him. But he is one step ahead, he covers the floor with slippery fish, and Leonard falls into the shark tank. Brian leaves the back hallways and runs right into Danny. He explains the whole situation to him and then they find Mary being taken care of by the Mall Ghost (Walker) but once they leave, Brian and Mary get left behind a little and see Danny and Shane get arrested. Now the fate of Christmas is in Brian and Mary's hands. They must get revenge on Leonard and Sheldon, who meet up with Ginger again to say they haven't retrieved the bag yet. She is furious and tells them to go find the kids with a no holds barred as Brian passes them on a motorcycle with the bag. The chase starts as Leonard, Sheldon, and Brian chase each other on the motorcycles. Mary drops a water balloon on Ginger and she starts chasing her. Brian makes them dive through a clothing kiosk and covers Leonard's face so he can't see where he's going. Mary goes back into the back hallways and lures Ginger onto the roof. After a sharp turn, Leonard and Sheldon break a window and fall into the wave pool. On the roof, Mary tricks Ginger into getting on a cracked window dome and she falls through but just slightly grabs the ledge preventing her from falling into the sea lions' pool. This catches Gordon's eye and his agents get suspicious. Mary throws the bag down and when Ginger hits below the agents arrest her. Just when they find out that the bag contains the counterfeit money, mall security bring Leonard and Sheldon to Gordon. The Saunders family gets released and Wayne is very upset at Danny for leaving Mary with Brian. On their way out, they walk into Sam Nichols (Walker) who owns the mall. He says that he is willing to give Wayne a job. At home, they forgot about getting a tree, presents, or anything. The next morning, Judy is able to get home before Christmas and the kids marvel as they see a tree and presents. The turkey is even ready. Mary gets a letter from Santa saying that he is the one responsible for everything. The film ends with her waving at him from the window, proving that Christmas miracles do happen. Cast Production The film is largely set and mostly filmed in West Edmonton Mall. Secrecy before it was announced led many Edmontonians to wonder why Christmas decorations were still in place long after Christmas had passed. Release The film was exhibited theatrically in Canada in 2007, but it premiered on television in the United States in 2008 as part of ABC Family's 25 Days of Christmas programming block. It was poorly received by the public.

Located on Yerevan's Republic Square, the museum has one of the most prominent locations in the Armenian capital. The NGA houses significant collections of Russian and Western European art, and the world's largest collection of Armenian art. The museum had 65,000 visitors in 2005. History The National Gallery of Armenia (NGA) was founded in 1921 under the decree of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (Armenian SSR) and represents the artistic section of the State museum. Upon its establishment the NGA's art section encountered difficulties, largely because Yerevan lacked state owned and private art collections to form the core of the collection. The first works to enter the collection where the dozens of works purchased from an Armenian painters' exhibition in August 1921. A decisive factor in the founding of the NGA's art collection was the transfer of the renowned collection of The Armenian Cultural Center (the former Lazarian Seminary, Moscow) and also the donations made by Armenian artists to the NGA. By 1925, 400 pieces by Armenian, Russian and European artists were on display throughout the six halls which compose the museum's art section. By 1935, the state art section, which had undergone many refurbishments, became a separate Art Museum. In 1947 the gallery was re-dubbed the State Picture Gallery of Armenia and subsequently renamed the National Gallery of Armenia in 1991. The picture gallery's large collection of works are on display thanks to the efforts of many dedicated compatriots and friendly donations from foreign associates.

The reverse of the handle shows a Master of Animals motif: two confronted lions, flanking a central figure (note confronted dogs and other animals below) Confronted animals, or confronted-animal as an adjective, where two animals face each other in a symmetrical pose, is an ancient bilateral motif in art and artifacts studied in archaeology and art history. The \\"anti-confronted animals\\" is the opposing motif, with the animals back to back. Bilateral symmetry is a dominant aspect of our world and strong representation of it with matching figures often creates a balance that is appealing in artwork. In ancient art, confronted-animal motifs often involve the Master of Animals, a central human figure between two confronted animals, often grasping them, and are probably part of a unified socio-cultural motif. A related motif in ancient art is known as the Mistress of Animals. It is thought that the iconography sometimes has ritual and religious associations; for example, the Lion Gate of Mycenae has a column between the protective, surmounted and confronted lionesses standing with two feet on the ground and two on the same base on which the column rests. The column is thought to represent a goddess, abstracted to avoid tabooed direct representation. Alternatively, the column has also been interpreted as symbolizing the entrance to the palace. The lions are thus guarding the entrance to the palace and the walled fortification simultaneously. The motif called the Tree of Life, where two confronted animals graze on a shrub or tree, is also very ancient. Gebel el-Arak Knife The reverse side of the Gebel el-Arak Knife handle, displayed at the top of the article, shows two powerful confronted lions, separated by a figure who is grasping them. Of note, the knob on the reverse shows the top end of the hole for a cord or rope, on the suspension lug; this knife may have been worn around the neck ceremonially. Examples from archaeology =Cylinder seals= Cylinder seal of Uruk displaying a confronted-lioness motif sometimes described as a \\"serpopard\\" - 3000 BC - Louvre Examples of confronted animals exist on Cylinder seals from Mesopotamia. Deities, or heroes grasping lionesses, cattle, griffins, or other, imaginary creatures are sometimes found. Many cylinder seals involving confronted goats surrounding a central Tree of life on a 'cone' or 'mountain' platform share one common theme. Others may be thought of as deities holding the animals under their control. Because cylinder seals are numerous and also come from pre-historical periods, back to the fourth or 5th millennium BC, themes are varied. Another Tree of life type of confronted animals cylinder seal has a \\"hero grasping water buffalo\\" and a \\"bull-man grasping lions\\", each between the animals; again, the central figure is the \\"Tree-of-Life\\" that often is interpreted as representing a goddess. =Confronted snakes= Figure from Crete, holding confronted snakes, dated 1600 BC. Confronted snakes are frequent images in many cultures from ancient times to historical periods. Often associated with religious ceremonies and deities, perhaps the most familiar figure known popularly from ancient times is the deity or priestess of Crete depicted holding up two confronted snakes on either side of her. A chlorite vessel from the area of contemporary Baghdad, Iraq is displayed at this link. It depicts three pairs of confronted animals. Two confronted snakes are being held in the hands of the central figure; below the snake-pair are a pair of anti-confronted-lionesses (although they turn their heads to face each other their hind quarters are closely confronted), recumbent. The third similar pair of animals on this item are two anti-confronted bovines with a human or deity between also. Two tumbling lions and other animals are depicted to the right. =Narmer Palette= Narmer Palette with confronted lionesses, displayed in iconographic registers - Ancient Egypt c. 3,000 BC The Narmer Palette, used to mix cosmetics in the receptacle on one side, has two confronted felines, sometimes called serpopards (because of their exaggerated long necks which look snakelike to some researchers) forming the receptacle. Close examination of the animals with the exaggerated, long necks supports identification as lionesses. The entire theme of the Narmer Palette, is about the pharaoh of the newly unified Ancient Egypt represented in two scenes, (palette obverse, palette reverse). On one side the pharaoh wears the crown of Upper Egypt and on the other, the pharaoh wears the crown of Lower Egypt. Thus, it is thought that the lionesses with their intertwining necks are representing two kingdoms, once separate, but now unified under one pharaoh. The lioness Bast had been the protective deity of one kingdom and the lioness Sekhmet of the other kingdom, equally important deities in each of the early Egyptian pantheons. Respectively, they were the special protectors of the pharaoh in each kingdom, who persisted as deities throughout the long history of unified Ancient Egypt. Eventually their roles diverged, however, with one becoming less of the protector and warrior deity and assigned other roles. Typically, many similar deities in the two kingdoms soon were merged, so the retention of both is thought to be the result of the long and strong tradition of each. Examples of other confronted animals exist on many cosmetic palettes of Ancient Egypt that have been discovered. One palette has confronted- hippopotamuses; others include giraffes, geese, and other animals familiar to the Egyptians. Bilaterally depicted palm trees also are known as well on palettes. =Mycenae Lion Gate= alt= The gate to the citadel of Mycenae is shown to the right. It crowned the major entrance gateway to the ancient citadel that was the centre of the culture, Mycenaean Greece, that predated that of Greece, and is a well-known example of two confronted lionesses. Debate exists in research of this image, questioning whether these are leopards or lionesses confronted with a column between them that represents the deity, but the characteristic tufts at the end of the tails confirm the species. Many images of lioness related deities are depicted with heavier manes than typical for lionesses, but that may have been the result of attempts to interpretation of the species or, unfamiliarity with the atypical dimorphic differences within this feline species. Alternatively, George Mylonas believed lions were depicted, not lionesses. =Ancient Greek herald's staffs (kerykeia)= In ancient Greece, heralds functioning as private messengers or public criers were referred to as kerykes. The keryx has functions in political, military, judicional and religious matters. He was identified by his attribute, the herald's staff or kerykeion, in Latin caduceus. The attribute also offered him protection. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, also carries a kerykeion. Kerykeia were often donated to temples by private persons and on state occasions. They are also found in herald's graves, and identify the profession of the buried person.

Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe File:Ancient Greek kerykeion MKG Hamburg.JPGAncient Greek herald's staff (kerykeion), Bronze, Sicily, 510-490 BC. Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe =Etruscan tomb mural= Confronted leopards protect a banquet in the afterlife where Etruscan couples dine and are served wine from the ewers held by servers before the seating - mural in a Tomb of the Leopards burial chamber - necropolis of Tarquinia - Lazio, Italy Confronted leopards appear in a tomb found in Tarchuna (Tarquinia), or Tarchna Tarchnal, the chief of the twelve cities of Etruria, a district in what is described as the Etruscan civilization that existed in Italy from 1200 BC through the 100 BC. It appears in the earliest history of Rome, which was dominated by it until early in the 330s BC. This mural features confronted leopards providing protection for a banquet in the afterlife. Frequently felines, lionesses and leopards such as these are confronted with a tree, shrub, or column between them in murals from this culture. The Etruscans are thought to have migrated from the area of Troy, through Greece where they absorbed many cultural elements, to Italy where they founded their culture in prehistoric times. =European art= In Europe, confronted animals are an important motif in animal style, or zoomorphic decoration, Insular art, and the Romanesque. In these contexts there may be little or nothing between the two animals, and the emphasis is on the pair themselves. Human figures are often treated in the same way, often mixed in with animals in decorative schemes - archers were especially popular in the Romanesque period. The early Anglo-Saxon ship burial found in contemporary Great Britain at Sutton Hoo, from the seventh century AD, contains famous examples of Migration Period art. The Sutton Hoo purse-lid has three stylized confronted-animal pairs; the two side pairs, left and right, are identical, and have the animals in the person's clutched grasp. The central confronted animals are even more complex in theme. Opposed animals are used in Insular art, the style of which is derived from a mixture of Celtic and northern European design traditions. Confronted animals, or animals intertwined in very intricate patterns, often depicted grabbing at each other to form the \\"gripping beast\\" pattern, are a main feature of some periods of Viking art. So intertwined are the animals, they are dissolved into pure ornament, and the individuals are barely discernable from each other. Confronted animals are also frequently seen in European Romanesque art, for example as decorative patterns in Romanesque architecture. Supporters in heraldry, not always a matched pair, continue the theme.

Few examples still exist of a special type of Oriental carpet, termed \\"animal carpets\\" because their main feature are confronted animals. Dated to the 13th‚Äì16th century, they represent carpets woven during the transition period between the late Seljuq and the early Ottoman empire. Parallels were shown between the \\"opposed animal\\" and \\"latch- hook\\" motifs from woven pile rugs and the LorestƒÅn bronzes. These are Early Iron Age bronze artifacts of various individual forms which have been recovered from LorestƒÅn and Kermanshah areas in west-central Iran. Carpet fragments discovered in Konya and Bey≈üehir in Turkey, and Fostat in Egypt were dated to the 13th century, which corresponds to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243‚Äì1302). Rows of horned quadrupeds placed opposite to each other, or birds beside a tree can be recognized on some of these fragments. A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between phoenix and dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet now displayed at the Pergamon Museum, Berlin, and radiocarbon dated to the mid 15th century. The Chinese motif was probably introduced into Islamic art by the Mongols during the thirteenth century. Another animal carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby. Since 1988, seven more carpets of the animal type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the Chinese cultural revolution. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist Gregorio di Cecco: \\"The Marriage of the Virgin\\", 1423. It shows large confronted animals, each with a smaller animal inside. An almost complete animal carpet is now at the Museum of Islamic Art, Doha. \\"Animal carpets\\" were also depicted in Italian paintings of the 14th and 15th century, and thus represent the earliest Oriental carpets shown in Renaissance paintings.

Its decoration consists of shell beadwork, depicting a central standing human figure flanked by two upright, opposed quadrupeds and surrounded by 34 discs. The two animals resemble one another in terms of their overall outline, but their tails and paws differ. The left-hand animal has a long tail and round paws with five articulated digits. The right-hand animal has a shorter tail, and its legs end in cloven hoofs. Historically, this artwork was believed to have belonged Powhatan, who was the paramount chief of Tsenacommacah, an alliance of Algonquian-speaking Virginia Indians in the Tidewater region of Virginia at the time English settlers landed at Jamestown in 1607. \\"Powhatan's Mantle\\" is one of the earliest North American artifacts to be collected by Europeans that still survives today.\\"Powhatan's Mantle\\" at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford See also *Book of Kells *Tierwirbel *Attitude (heraldry) *Master of Animals *Supporter References External links Cylinder seal: confronted-animals *PhotoCylinder Seal-High Res - Two animals, each held by a deity or priest; Center Motif: Tree of life *Photo variation of Tree of life confronted-animals; Article - One figure is facing toward the observer. *Nomadic Art of the Eastern Eurasian Steppes, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on confronted animals Confronted snakes *Photoconfronted snakes; Article Category:Iconography Category:Animals in art Category:Symmetry Category:Visual motifs ","title":"Confronted animals"},{"id":"13921347","text":"Flat Rock Camp is an Adirondack Great Camp in Willsboro, New York. It is located on Willsboro Point, on Lake Champlain.  History  In 1885, Augustus G. Paine, Jr. (1866‚Äì1947) moved to Willsboro, New York to manage a local pulp mill, and began buying land in the area, eventually amassing about , including three miles (4.8 km) of Lake Champlain shoreline.Loughrey, Janet. Gardens Adirondack Style. Down East Enterprises (2005). . pp. 137-140 Flat Rock Camp, which was named after the flat shelf of Potsdam sandstone the house is built on, was constructed according to Paine's designs as a summer retreat for himself and his family. Work began in 1890 and continued in stages over roughly the next 20 years. It was largely built by Lyman Smith, Paine's immediate neighbor to the north. The numerous stone chimneys were erected by Peter Lacey, a stonemason from Keeseville, New York. As originally constructed, the camp consisted of numerous buildings, including the main house, two cabins, a chapel, an icehouse, servant's quarters, and other service outbuildings, many of which were demolished after Paine's death. The main house, which still survives, is a single story building, with seven bedrooms, a dining room and a large living room with a vaulted ceiling. In its heyday, up to thirty guests could be accommodated at the compound, along with staff. The camp was supported by orchards, a dairy farm, and a vegetable garden. The compound also featured extensive gardens, planted on topsoil laid over the sandstone, which were maintained under the guidance of Paine's first wife, Maud Eustis Potts, and, after her death, his second wife Francisca Machado Warren and their daughter, Francisca Warren Paine. The gardens are listed in the Smithsonian Archives of American Gardens. The camp and its surrounding property, which includes wetlands, farmland, orchards and forests, are still owned by the Paine family, but in 1978 they were placed under the stewardship of the Adirondack Nature Conservancy to ensure that the land will not be developed in the future.

The camp is located on Upper Saranac Lake near two other Coulter Great Camps, Prospect Point Camp and Eagle Island Camp. The name is taken from a nearby rocky, moss-covered ledge that still is a notable feature of the shoreline. The camp consists of a main lodge, guest house, dining hall, boat house, and, some distance from the rest, a tea house built on a promontory overlooking the lake. The buildings are constructed of unpeeled logs; some are notched-corner style log cabins, others are shingles over plank walls. The style is similar to nearby Camp Pinebrook, another Coulter design. The camp was given to Syracuse University in 1948. It is now in private hands.

William L. Coulter's design is a significant example of the Adirondack Rustic style. It is located on a bluff overlooking the northern reaches of Upper Saranac Lake, near Eagle Island Camp and Moss Ledge, two other Coulter designs. Its grand scale is typical of the opulent camps of the area in the great camp era. The camp was built for New York copper magnate and financier Adolph Lewisohn. In a departure from the tendency of camps to be sheltered in the woods, Prospect Point Camp towers over its shoreline, approached by several broad flights of steps from the water. The main lodge is a three-story chalet with a half-timbered effect, with birch bark filling the role usually played by brick or stucco. Birch bark is also used as a ceiling treatment between the beams. Interior walls were finished with local spruce, but also with southern pine, stained green or tan. The boathouse was the largest on the lake. The camp had a gasoline-powered generator, and telephones throughout. In the 1940s, the camp was sold, and had a brief career as a lodge, Sekon in the Pines. It was sold again in 1951, and used as a summer camp for young Jewish girls. In 1969, it was purchased by Young Life, a Christian non-denominational ministry based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, who use it for one-week-long educational camping sessions. Saranac Village celebrated its 50th Anniversary of Young Life camping in August 2020.

After Elizabeth's death, he married Sarah Oliver White on 15 September 1835. Sarah died in September 1840 without having children. Immigration to Australia In February 1814 Garling and another English attorney William Henry Moore were induced to travel to New South Wales by the Colonial Office in the United Kingdom to begin life as a solicitor in that colony. He was offered the sum of ¬£300 to undertake the journey. Both Moore and Garling were first called 'stipendiary Solicitors', and then were later called 'Crown or Government Solicitors'. Although they were referred to as crown solicitors, they were not considered to be professionally retained by the Crown and were independent of it. At the time in New South Wales, the only legally trained persons were those with criminal backgrounds who had been transported to Sydney as convicts. Attorneys such as George Crossley and others whilst permitted to appear in court as agents (and not lawyers), were not allowed to be admitted due to the English laws which precluded the admission of legal professionals with criminal backgrounds. Garling left the United Kingdom on 20 October 1814 with his wife Elizabeth and five children. They sailed on the Francis and Eliza. The ship was captured by an American privateer off the island of Madeira. Garling did not arrive in Sydney until 8 August 1815 ostensibly because of this. Historian John Bennett notes that this was unlikely as the cause of the delay, and that in fact, the delay was due to Garling not wishing to leave earlier.History of the New South Wales Bar, Bennett, John The other lawyer Moore arrived seven months earlier. The biographers for both Garling and Moore note that on 11 May 1815, Moore was the first attorney admitted to the first Supreme Court (being the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature and Garling was the second. It is probable that Garling was the first solicitor admitted to the second Supreme Court which was opened by the first Chief Justice of New South Wales Francis Forbes in May 1824. Forbes formally re-admitted all existing practitioners in the colony. Whilst Garling appears first on the roll, it is claimed that the roll dates from no earlier than 1828. Whatever the merits of the argument, both Moore and Garling can be jointly considered as the first solicitors of New South Wales being appointed at the same time by the Colonial Office prior to their embarkation to Sydney. Acting deputy judge advocate The post of Deputy Judge Advocate became vacant after the death of Ellis Bent on 10 November 1815. Governor Macquarie offered Garling the office of Deputy Judge Advocate on an acting basis from 12 December 1815. Garling held this office until the arrival of John Wylde on 5 October 1816. Garling was progressive in that he apparently allowed emancipist solicitors to practise in the courts over which he presided. Macquaire also appointed Garling a justice of the peace. This was an important appointment in the colony, as at the time, a justice of the peace was in effect a local authority governing planning, liquor trading and employment regulation. Additionally, one of the functions of the Deputy Judge Advocate as a justice of the peace was to sit as a court of petty sessions hearing less serious criminal charges. Post Supreme Court era Garling and Moore's appointments as \\"Crown Solicitors\\" were abolished in 1828. The office was revived in 1829 but neither Garling nor Moore were reappointed. Until 1832 Garling received an allowance for being the Crown Solicitor notwithstanding that his appointment was no longer valid. Garling was appointed as the Clerk of the Peace for the County of Cumberland. Today, this comprises the whole of the land area into which modern Sydney now has transformed. However, at the time, the county only comprised various townships including Sydney, Parramatta and Windsor. The role of the clerk of the peace is as the registrar of the Court of Quarter Sessions. Apparently Garling was also empowered to file informations in the name of the attorney-general, although it is not clear whether this involved actually prosecuting criminals. In 1830 he was appointed as a crown prosecutor and held this role until 1837. He continued as clerk of the peace until 1839 when he could no longer perform both role as crown prosecutor and clerk of the peace. Garling was recommended for the post of attorney-general in Van Diemen's Land, now the State of Tasmania in Australia. Garling died on 2 May 1848 aged 73 years. He was buried in Devonshire Street cemetery in Sydney. Practice Garling's biographer describes him as \\"generous and public-spirited\\" and a member of many benevolent institutions in New South Wales. Garling appears to have done well as a lawyer in Sydney. Commissioner John Thomas Bigge was commissioned to report on the state of the New South Wales colony to the Colonial Office. In his report on the legal affairs of the colony, Bigge reported that Garling and Moore had been 'very fully remunerated' for the expense of moving to the colony. Author Forbes observes that Garling and Moore were both unremarkable \\"men of their day\\". This has to borne in mind with the background of New South Wales at the time. The colony was still considered a backward outpost of the British Empire consisting largely of convicts and ex-convicts. The legal work of the colony largely comprised defamation and debt recovery claims. Forbes notes that some commentators have suggested that Garling and More were \\"not particularly good \\". Forbes also notes that the first chief justice, Francis Forbes, observed that if Moore and Garling had remained in England as attorneys, they \\"would have been fortunate to be allowed to sit at the same dining table in an hotel as the circuit barristers\\". This is a reference to the fact that at that time, most junior barristers earned their living in unfashionable circuits in country areas of England. Support for fusion of the legal profession The colony of New South Wales did not have a split legal profession like that in England. Legal practitioners were admitted as both advocates and attorneys. After the second Supreme Court started business, barristers moved for the court to formally split the profession into barristers and into solicitors. Garling, along with other practitioners, opposed the splitting of the bar in this manner when it was first mooted in 1824 by newly arrived barristers in the colony. Chief Justice Francis Forbes upheld the fusion of the bar and the legal profession. Whilst Garling opposed the notion, Author Forbes notes that Garling knew his place. Garling was quoted in the Sydney Gazette on 16 September 1824 as observing that his instinct was to defer to gentlemen with the \\"higher duties of barrister\\".

He was the successor and brother of Gjin Progoni and their father, Progon of Kruja. His father was Progon of Kruja. Following the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade, he managed to further secure the independence of Arbanon and extended its influence to its maximum height. Throughout much his rule he was in struggle against the Republic of Venice, Zeta of ƒêorƒëe Nemanjiƒá and later the Despotate of Epiros and inversely, maintained good relations with their rivals, the Republic of Ragusa, and at first Stefan Nemanjiƒá of Ra≈°ka, whose daughter Komnena he married. The G√´ziq inscription found in the Catholic church of Nd√´rfand√´ (modern G√´ziq) shows that by the end of his life he was a Catholic. In Latin documents, of the time, he is often styled as princeps Arbanorum (prince of the Albanians) and in Byzantine documents as megas archon and later as Panhypersebastos. Under increasing pressure from the Despotate of Epiros, his death around 1216 marks the end of Arbanon as a state and the beginning of a period of autonomy until its final ruler Golem of Kruja joined the Nicaean Empire. The annexation sparked the Rebellion of Arbanon in 1257. He didn't have any sons to continue his dynasty, but his wealth and a part of his domain in Mirdita passed after Demetrio's death to his underage nephew, Progon (son of Gjin), whom he named protosevastos. The Dukagjini family which appeared in historical record 70 years later in the same region may have been relatives or direct descendants of the Progoni. In historical record, Demetrio Progoni is the first ruler to call himself Prince of the Albanians and the first to identify his domain as Principatum Albaniae (Principality of Albania/Arbanon). Many later feudal rulers of Albania would lay claim to the same title and present their rule as the continuation of this state. The first to do so was Charles I of Anjou who sought to legitimize the Kingdom of Albania as a descendant state of the Principality of Arbanon about 60 years later, in 1272. Background Progon of Kruja, father of Dhimit√´r Progoni formed the first Albanian state during the Middle Ages. Little is known about archon Progon who ruled Kruj√´ and its surroundings at least since the era between 1190 and 1198. The Kruj√´ castle and other territories remained in the possession of the Progon family, and Progon was succeeded by his sons Gjin, and later Demetrio. Before 1204, Arbanon was an autonomous principality of the Byzantine Empire. The fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, had two main political consequences for the region of Albania. The first was that Byzantine overlordship had crumbled, which allowed for the local rulers to seek independence. The second was that in accordance to the agreements about the partition of the Byzantine Empire, control of Albania had been awarded to the Republic of Venice. In this geopolitical environment, Dhimit√´r Progoni assumed power in 1207-08. In primary sources of the period, he is mostly referred to as Demetrius (Demetrius, Progoni archontis filius et successor) or Demetrio Progoni.  Rule  Kruj√´ and its fortress were the center of the Principality of Arbanon Since the beginning of his rule, Progoni sought out to create friendly networks in foreign policy in order to preserve the sovereignty of Arbanon against external threats, the most important of whom were for much of his reign the Republic of Venice and later the Despotate of Epiros. In 1208-09, he considered conversion to Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy for the first time in order to obtain support against his Venetian rivals. As Venice had been given the nominal rights to control Albania, conversion to Catholicism would nullify Venetian claims over territory controlled by another Catholic state, the Principality of Arbanon. It would also protect him from expansion by post-Byzantine successor states like the Despotate of Epiros. In his preserved correspondence with Pope Innocent III, Progoni as leader of the iudices of Arbanon, who signed as his followers, asked the Pope to send missionaries to spread Catholicism in his land. The Pope responded that Nicolaus, the Catholic archdeacon of Durr√´s had been instructed to make preparations for the mission. Shortly after, however, Demetrio stopped the process because he didn't consider it important any longer. He had defeated ƒêorƒëe Nemanjiƒá, a Venetian vassal whom he bordered to the north and thus felt less threatened by Venice. Nemanjiƒá had previously promised military support to Venice if Progoni attacked Venetian territory, in a treaty signed on 3 July 1208. He also had secured a marriage with Komnena Nemanjiƒá, who was both the daughter of Stefan Nemanjiƒá, rival of ƒêorƒëe Nemanjiƒá and grand-daughter of the last Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos. In this context, because of the relation of his consort to the Byzantine imperial family, he was recognized by the title of panhypersevastos. After the death of the Catholic archbishop of Durr√´s, the Venetians and Progoni - each in their respective territories - seized church property. For his actions against church property, he was excommunicated. He used the title princeps Arbanorum (\\"prince of the Albanians\\") to refer to himself and was recognized as such by foreign dignitaries. In the correspondence with Innocent III, the territory he claimed as princeps Arbanorum was the area between Shkodra, Prizren, Ohrid and Durr√´s (regionis montosae inter Scodram, Dyrrachium, Achridam et Prizrenam sitae). In general, Progoni brought the principality to its climax. The area the principality controlled, ranged from the Shkumbin river valley to the Drin river valley in the north and from the Adriatic sea to the Black Drin in the east. In Latin documents, he was is also referred to as iudex. In Byzantine records, he is titled as megas archon and after the consolidation of his rule as panhypersebastos. In search for allies, he also signed a treaty with the Republic of Ragusa which allowed for free passage of Ragusan merchants in Albanian territory. In 1210, an agreement was concluded between the Republic of Venice and Michael I Komnenos Doukas of the Despotate of Epiros under which Doukas would become a vassal of Venice, if the republic recognized his claims up to the Shkumbin river valley, a core area of Arbanon. In 1212, Venice also allowed for the possession of the coastal duchy of Durr√´s to pass to Michael and abandoned its direct control of central Albania. The agreement had dire consequences for the principality, which surrounded by hostile forces, seems to have been reduced by the end of the life of Dhimit√´r Progoni to the area north of Shkumbin and south of Drin. Evidence for this period has been provided by the foundational inscription of the Catholic church of G√´ziq in the Nd√´rfand√´ near modern Rreshen in Mirdita. The inscription is written in Latin and has been produced after Progoni's death. The inscription shows that Progoni, who had been reaccepted in the Catholic Church, had provided funds for the building of the church, which he might have planned to become the seat of the Diocese of Arbanum or a new diocese in the centre of his remaining domain. This is indicated by the fact that the new church was built on the site of an older church dedicated to St. Mary but Progoni dedicated the new church to Sh√´n Premte, the patron saint of Arbanum. He had maintained the semi-independence of this area under an agreement in which he accepted the high suzerainty of Zeta and the rulers of Zeta didn't get involved in internal affairs of the region in return. In the inscription which also serves as the last will of Progoni, the church is dedicated to his people (nationi obtulit) and his successor is designated, Progon - son of Gjin Progoni - as protosevastos.  Death and legacy  The Kingdom of Albania, around 70 years after Progoni's death, was claimed to be a successor state by Charles I of Anjou He died around 1215-16. His wife was soon married off to Gregory Kamonas who needed the wedding to happen in order legitimize succession of power. After he took control of Kruja, strengthening relations with Grand Principality of Serbia, which had weakened after a Slavic assault on Scutari. Komnena had a daughter with Kamonas that married Golem, who continued to rule as a semi-independent ruler in Arbanon under Theodore Komnenos Doukas of the Despotate of Epiros (until 1230) and then Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria until his death in 1241.. He then oscillated between Doukas and the Nicaeans until he was finally annexed by the Nicaeans in the phase of reconstitution of the Byzantine Empire in 1252-56. The events prompted the Rebellion of Arbanon in 1257. The Principality of Arbanon is the first Albanian state that emerged in the Middle Ages. Under Progoni, it reached its maximum extent. Progoni was the first to use the terms Princeps Arbanorum and Princeps Albaniae. The legacy of a local, independent power center in Albania was used by future rulers to legitimize their power by presenting their realms as its successors. The first to do so was Charles I of Anjou with the creation of Kingdom of Albania around 70 years later. In Albanian historiography, his attempt has been assessed negatively as an \\"Anjou invention\\" which sought to turn Albania into an armed base for Angevin campaigns in contrast to the Principality of Arbanon, which was an attempt of local unification and independence from the Byzantines. Progoni didn't have any sons. His successor was his nephew, Progon. The rule of this Progon in the Mirdita area, the many similarities between the emblem of the Progoni family in the G√´ziq inscription and the coat of arms of the later Dukagjini family and the claim of the Dukagjini that they were the hereditary overlords of Nd√´rfand√´ and the abbacy of G√´ziq has led historians to consider that the two clans may have been related or even that the Dukagjini were descendants of the Progoni via protosevastos Progon. The connection of the church of Nd√´rfand√´ with the Diocese of Arbanum and consequently with the territory of Arbanon led to later disputes. The Dukagjini who held hereditary rights over the region, were in actual control of the abbacy. Gjon Kastrioti who held control of the territory of the diocese of Arbanum claimed that the abbacy should pass into his territory. The dispute was solved with mediation by the Papacy, which transferred it to the Diocese of Lezh√´ which had been formed in the 15th century and was de jure part of the Dukagjini lands.

First titled \\"The Elf Child\\", the name was changed by Riley to \\"Little Orphant Allie\\" at its third printing; however, a typesetting error during printing renamed the poem to its current form. Known as the \\"Hoosier poet\\", Riley wrote the rhymes in nineteenth-century Hoosier dialect. As one of his most well known poems, it served as the inspiration for the character Little Orphan Annie upon whom was based a comic strip, plays, radio programs, television shows, and movies. The subject was inspired by Mary Alice \\"Allie\\" Smith, an orphan living in the Riley home during her childhood. The poem contains four stanzas; the first introduces Annie and the second and third are stories she is telling to young children. Each story tells of a bad child who is snatched away by goblins as a result of his or her misbehavior. The underlying moral and warning is announced in the final stanza, telling children that they should obey their parents and be kind to the unfortunate, lest they suffer the same fate. Background James Whitcomb Riley, c. 1913 James Whitcomb Riley was a poet who achieved national fame in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. \\"Little Orphant Annie\\" is one of Whitcomb's most well known poems. Originally published in the Indianapolis Journal on November 15, 1885, under the title \\"The Elf Child\\", the poem was inspired by a girl named Mary Alice \\"Allie\\" Smith. Mary Alice Smith was born near Liberty, Union County, Indiana, 25 September 1850. She lived on a small farm with her parents until (as one story goes) both parents died when she was about nine years old. Some stories say that Mary's mother died when she was very young and her father, Peter Smith, died when she was ten. Other evidence points to her father's being incarcerated at the time. Whatever the cause, she was considered an orphan. Mary's uncle, a John Rittenhouse, came to Union County and took the young orphan to his home in Greenfield where he \\"dressed her in black\\" and \\"bound her out to earn her board and keep\\". Mary Alice was taken in by Captain Reuben Riley as a \\"bound\\" servant to help his wife Elizabeth Riley with the housework and her four children: John, James, Elva May and Alex. As was customary at that time, she worked alongside the family to earn her board.Van Allen, p. 33 In the evening hours, she often told stories to the younger children, including Riley. The family called her a \\"Guest\\" not a servant and treated her like she was part of their family. Smith did not learn she was the inspiration for the character until the 1910s when she visited with Riley. Riley had previously presented a fictionalized version of Mary Alice Smith in his short story \\"Where Is Mary Alice Smith?,\\" published in The Indianapolis Journal of 30 September 1882. In it, Mary Alice arrives at her benefactor family's home and wastes no time in telling the children a grisly story of murder by decapitation and then later introduces them to her soldier friend Dave who is soon killed upon going off to war. The plot of this short story was heavily incorporated into the 1918 movie adaptation as well as Johnny Gruelle's 1921 storybook.Note in The Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley in Which the Poems, Including a Number Heretofore Unpublished, Are Arranged in the Order in Which They Were Written, Together with Photographs, Bibliographic Notes, and a Life Sketch of the Author, ed. Edmund Henry Eitel, \\"biographical edition,\\" vol. 6, Indianapolis: Bobbs‚ÄêMerrill Co., 1913, 403. Both \\"The Elf Child\\" and \\"Where Is Mary Alice Smith?\\" were printed in book form for the first time in 1885 in The Boss Girl.James Whitcomb Riley, The Boss Girl: A Christmas Story, and Other Sketches, Indianapolis: Bowen‚ÄêMerrill Co., 1885, 177‚Äì196. \\"The Elf Child\\" kept its original title in its first two printings, but Riley decided to change its title to \\"Little Orphant Allie\\" in an 1889 printing. The printing house incorrectly cast the typeset during the printing, unintentionally renaming the poem to \\"Little Orphant Annie\\". Riley at first contacted the printing house to have the error corrected, but decided to keep the misprint because of the poem's growing popularity.James Whitcomb Riley, \\"Little Orphant Annie,\\" Old‚ÄêFashioned Roses, Indianapolis: Bowen‚ÄêMerrill Co., 1889, 111‚Äì113. When reprinted in The Orphant Annie Book in 1908, the poem was given an additional, introductory verse (\\"Little Orphant Annie she knows riddles, rhymes and things! ...\\").James Whitcomb Riley, \\"Little Orphant Annie,\\" The Orphant Annie Book, Indianapolis: Bobbs‚ÄêMerrill Co., 1908, unpaginated. During the 1910s and 1920s, the title became the inspiration for the names of Little Orphan Annie and the Raggedy Ann doll, created by fellow Indiana native Johnny Gruelle. The rhyme's popularity led its to being reprinted many times. It was later compiled with a number of other children's poems in an illustrated book and sold.Van Allen, p. 241 The verses of the poem detail the scary stories told by Annie when her housework was done, repeating the phrase \\"An' the Gobble-uns 'at gits you ef you don't watch out!\\" It was popular among children, and many of the letters Whitcomb received from children commented on the poem. It remains a favorite among children in Indiana and is often associated with Halloween celebrations. Poem Riley recorded readings of several of his poems for the phonograph during the early twentieth century. Only four of the readings were ever released to the public; one was \\"Little Orphant Annie\\". Written in nineteenth century Hoosier dialect, the words can be difficult to read in modern times; however, its style helped feed its popularity at the time of its composition.Pfeiler, p. 111 Riley achieved fame not just for writing poetry, but also from his readings. Like most of his poetry, \\"Little Orphant Annie\\" was written to achieve the best effect when read aloud.Pfeiler, p. 109 The poem consists of four stanzas, each with twelve lines. Riley dedicated his poem \\"to all the little ones,\\" which served as an introduction to draw the attention of his audience when read aloud. The alliteration, parallels, phonetic intensifiers and onomatopoeia add effects to the rhymes that become more detectable when read aloud. The exclamatory refrain ending each stanza is spoken with more emphasis. The poem is written in the first person and in a regular iambic meter. It begins by introducing Annie, and then sets a mood of excitement by describing the children eagerly gathering to hear her stories. The next two stanzas are each a story which Annie tells the children. Each story tells of a bad child who is snatched away by goblins and has an underlying moral which is announced in the final stanza, encouraging children to obey their parents and teachers, help their loved ones, and care for the poor and disadvantaged.Pfeiler, p. 110 > :Little Orphant Annie :Little Orphant Annie's come to our house to stay, > :An' wash the cups an' saucers up, an' brush the crumbs away, :An' shoo the > chickens off the porch, an' dust the hearth, an' sweep, :An' make the fire, > an' bake the bread, an' earn her board-an'-keep; :An' all us other children, > when the supper-things is done, :We set around the kitchen fire an' has the > mostest fun :A-list'nin' to the witch-tales 'at Annie tells about, :An' the > Gobble-uns 'at gits you ::Ef you :::Don't ::::Watch :::::Out! ::Wunst they > wuz a little boy wouldn't say his prayers, ::An' when he went to bed at > night, away up-stairs, ::His Mammy heerd him holler, an' his Daddy heerd him > bawl, ::An' when they turn't the kivvers down, he wuzn't there at all! ::An' > they seeked him in the rafter-room, an' cubby-hole, an' press, ::An' seeked > him up the chimbly-flue, an' ever'-wheres, I guess; ::But all they ever > found wuz thist his pants an' roundabout: ::An' the Gobble-uns 'll git you > :::Ef you ::::Don't :::::Watch ::::::Out! :::An' one time a little girl 'ud > allus laugh an' grin, :::An' make fun of ever' one, an' all her blood- > an'-kin; :::An' wunst, when they was \\"company,\\" an' ole folks wuz there, > :::She mocked 'em an' shocked 'em, an' said she didn't care! :::An' thist as > she kicked her heels, an' turn't to run an' hide, :::They wuz two great big > Black Things a-standin' by her side, :::An' they snatched her through the > ceilin' 'fore she knowed what she's about! :::An' the Gobble-uns 'll git you > ::::Ef you :::::Don't :::::Watch ::::::Out! ::::An' little Orphant Annie > says, when the blaze is blue, ::::An' the lamp-wick sputters, an' the wind > goes woo-oo! ::::An' you hear the crickets quit, an' the moon is gray, > ::::An' the lightnin'-bugs in dew is all squenched away, ::::You better > mind yer parunts, an' yer teachurs fond an' dear, ::::An' churish them 'at > loves you, an' dry the orphant's tear, ::::An' he'p the pore an' needy ones > 'at clusters all about, ::::Er the Gobble-uns 'll git you :::::Ef you > ::::::Don't :::::::Watch ::::::::Out! Film adaptations Illustration by Ethel Franklin Betts in the Orphan Annie book While the Heart Beats Young by James Whitcomb Riley Little Orphant Annie was made into a silent film in 1918, featuring Colleen Moore as Annie. She had previously been in A Hoosier Romance, also based on Riley's work. Riley also appeared in the film as the silent narrator. A short animated film based on the poem was released by Soyuztelefilm studio in Russia in 1992, directed by Yulian Kalisher. The poem was translated into Russian by Oleg Yegorov. Derivative work In The Orphant Annie Story Book (1921), author Johnny Gruelle augments the character's background story and goes to great lengths to soften her image, portraying her as telling pleasant tales of fairies, gnomes and anthropomorphic animals rather than her characteristic horror stories.Johnny Gruelle, The Orphant Annie Story Book, Indianapolis: Bobbs‚ÄêMerrill Co., 1921. In popular culture In the TV series Getting On, the character of Birdy Lamb recites part of the poem at the end of Episode 3 of Season 3. The last stanza is also recited by two girls and the character Little Ann Sliger while jumping rope in the movie Texas Killing Fields ( 2011). In the documentary, Cracking Up: The Darrell Hammond Story, comedian Darrell Hammond relates that his mother would stand in his doorway at night and recite the poem when he was a child.

She became a nun after the enlightenment of her half-brother and became the foremost bhikkhuni in the practise of jhana (total meditative absorption). She lived during the 6th century BCE in what is now Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in India. Early years When she was born, Princess NandƒÅ was lovingly welcomed by her parents: Her father was King ≈öuddhodana, also the father of Siddhartha; her mother was Mahaprajapati. Mahaprajapati was the second wife of Suddhodarna and the younger sister of his first wife, the late Queen Maya. Nanda's name means joy, contentment, pleasure, and was named as her parents were especially joyous about the arrival of a newborn baby. Nanda was known in her childhood for being extremely well-bred, graceful and beautiful. To disambiguate her from Sakyans by the same name, she was also known as \\"Rupa-Nanda,\\" \\"one of delightful form,\\" or sometimes \\"Sundari-Nanda,\\" \\"beautiful Nanda.\\" Over time, many members of her family, the family of the Sakyans of Kapilavastu, left the worldly life for the ascetic life, inspired by the enlightenment of their Crown Prince Siddhartha. Amongst them was her brother Nanda, and her cousins Anuruddha and Ananda, who were two of the Buddha‚Äôs five leading disciples. Her mother, was the first Buddhist nun, having asked the Buddha to allow women into the sangha. As a result of this, many other royal Sakyan ladies, including Princess YasodharƒÅ, the wife of Siddhartha became Buddhist monastics. Thereupon, Nanda also renounced the world, but it was recorded that she did not do it out of confidence in the Buddha and the dharma, but out of blood love for her relatives and a feeling of belonging. Renunciation It soon became obvious that Nanda was not fully focused on her life as a nun. Nanda's thoughts were mainly directed centred on her own beauty and her popularity with the people, characteristics which were the karma of meritorious actions in past lives. These karmic traits became impediments to Nanda, since she neglected to reinforce them with new actions. She felt guilty that she was not fulfilling the lofty expectations that others had of her, and that she was far from the objective for which so many of the Sakyan royal family had renounced their worldly life. She was certain that the Buddha would censure her, so she evaded him for a long time. Enlightenment Buddha stops Nanda, who tried to escape from the Sangha. One day, the Buddha requested all the bhikkhunis to come to him individually, to receive his teaching, but Nanda did not obey. The Buddha let her be called explicitly, and then she presented herself, in an ashamed and anxious demeanour. The Buddha addressed her and appealed to all of her positive qualities so that Nanda willingly listened to him and delighted in his words. He knew that the conversation had raised her spirits and had made her joyful and ready to accept his teaching. Since Nanda was so preoccupied with her physical beauty, the Buddha used his psychic powers to conjure the vision of a woman more beautiful than Nanda, who then aged quickly and visibly in front of her own eyes. As a result, Nanda could see, in a short time span, what could otherwise only be noticed in humans in a time span of decades: the recession of youth and beauty, the decay, the appearance of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. This vision affected Nanda deeply; she was shaken to the core. After having shown Nanda this confronting image, the Buddha could explain the law of impermanence to her in such a manner that she grasped its truth completely, and thereby attained the knowledge of future liberation ‚Äî stream-entry. As a meditation subject, the Buddha advised her to contemplate the impermanence and foulness of the body. She persevered for extended periods with this practice \\"faithful and courageous day and night\\"; She described this in her verses: As Nanda had been overly concerned with her physical appearance, it had been necessary for her to apply the extreme of meditations on bodily unattractiveness as a counterbalance to find equanimity between the two opposites. Later the Buddha recognised his half-sister as being the foremost amongst bhikkunis who practiced Jhana. This meant that she not only followed the analytical way of insight, but emphasised the experience of tranquillity. Enjoying this pure well-being, she no longer needed any sensual enjoyments and soon found inner peace, despite having become a member of the sangha out of attachment to her relatives.

M. Stirling. It was first published by Tor Books in hardcover in November 2006, with a book club edition co-published with the Science Fiction Book Club following in December of the same year. Tor issued paperback, ebook and trade paperback editions in October 2007, April 2010 and May 2010, respectively. Audiobook editions were published by Tantor Media in January 2007. The book takes place on the planet Venus in an alternate solar system where probes from the United States of America, and the Soviet Union, find intelligent life and civilizations on both Venus and Mars. The book is heavily influenced by the works of writers such as Ray Bradbury, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Arthur C. Clarke, and Larry Niven, among others. The sequel, In the Courts of the Crimson Kings, is set on Mars. Plot summary In this alternate universe, life exists on Venus and Mars. Because of this discovery, the United States and the Soviet Union have poured all their resources into space exploration, sending their best and brightest to colonize Venus and Mars. Although there have been a few outbreaks of hostilities on Earth, an uneasy d√©tente exists in space between the Americans and Soviets who are struggling for supremacy, supported by their respective allies. The European Union is also anxious not to be excluded from this neo-colonial race but is far behind the other powers. In 1962 the USSR drops planetary probes on Venus and discovers people, both humans and Neanderthals, on the planet. Crewed flights by the Soviets and later by the Americans establish bases on the planet (the American one named Jamestown; the Soviet one Cosmograd) and find other familiar species, including dinosaurs. Both fauna and flora are strangely similar to those from Earth's past. In 1988, Lieutenant Marc Vitrac, a Ranger in the US Aerospace Force, has been on the planet for a year. Born in a Cajun family amidst the Louisiana bayous, his primary function is exploration of the vast wild lands but in the beginning of the novel he is tapped to welcome newcomers to the colony. The new arrivals are somewhat taken back by the ceratopsia used as a shuttle bus. The dinosaur has been \\"iced\\" by the insertion of an Internal Control Device into its brain, which allows the creature to be controlled with messages sent directly to the brain. These new arrivals include Cynthia Whitlock, a young African-American specialist, and Wing Commander Christopher Blair, a supposedly British linguist. As with all the Terrans on the planet, Cynthia and Blair also have other skills. Blair spends most of his time in the nearby town of Kartahown extending their knowledge of one of the native languages. As the story progresses many of the characters comment about how similarly evolution has progressed on Venus and on Earth. Naturally, the scientists at the Jamestown base are puzzled by the seeming parallelisms of evolution. Although the base doesn't have any means to check DNA (as in this alternate timeline, the majority of research funding has been spent on space travel), other tests indicate that the natives are closely related to Terrans. The fossil record is very spotty, with occasional infusions of new species, but no one has an explanation as to why there are humans and other Earth animals and plants on Venus. On another part of Venus, an unknown, external force interferes with the computer on a Soviet shuttle, causing it to crash land in the unexplored wild lands. The Soviets ask for American assistance to recover the crew. The airship Vepaja, with Captain Tyler commanding, is selected for the rescue attempt and Marc, Cynthia, and Chris are chosen as the crew. Jadviga Binkis, wife of the Soviet shuttle commander, is also included in the crew. Marc also takes his Epicyon pup, Tahyo, with them. The weather, animals, mechanical failure and sabotage from an unknown enemy eventually forces the group to abandon the airship. Once they arrive at their destination they find themselves in the midst of a civil war between the very human Cloud Mountain People and the Neanderthals. Additionally, an alien AI is annoyed at the Terrans for interfering with the Venusians. The AI is sapient, but not sentient and is able to control both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis within a short range. Unsure as to what to do, the AI calls for its creator race to return. Additionally, Blair discovers that the Cloud People speak a Proto-Indo-European language, indicating that the creator race has taken Homo sapiens from earth and seeded them on Venus within the last several thousand years. The group sides with the Cloud Mountain People, Marc having fallen in love with their princess, and helps them defeat the Neanderthals. The Cloud Mountain People's lands were destroyed, however, by a biological weapon on board the downed Soviet shuttle. Marc thus leads the Cloud Mountain People on a five thousand mile overland journey back to Jamestown to settle around the base and brings with him an alien artifact that may be evidence of the alien race that brought life to Venus and Mars.

It is one of Fender's attempts to compete with the superstrat-style guitars produced by Ibanez, Jackson/Charvel, Carvin Corporation and Yamaha. Since the Prodigy series was discontinued after about two and half years of production without a clear reason, it is considered one of Fender's rare models because of its limited production. Fender also produced a Prodigy Bass based on the Precision Bass Plus Deluxe featuring a P/J pickup layout (P as in Fender Precision Bass and J as in Fender Jazz Bass), 2-band active circuitry and a \\"fine-tuner\\" Schaller Elite bridge assembly. Design The Prodigy series featured two single coil pickups and one humbucker at the bridge position (sometimes referred to as a Fat Strat configuration). The body shape was similar to that of the Stratocaster; however, it featured an offset body with sharper body edges. The Prodigy was relatively different from the Fender HM Strat since it used Leo Fender's classic Synchronized tremolo system. The Prodigy II was introduced in 1992 which reprised the Kahler locking tremolo and nut system from the HM Strat; this model also featured Fender/Schaller tuners and black hardware. The prodigy neck featured 22 frets and a 12\\" radius maple or rosewood fretboard. Its headstock was strongly reminiscent of the Stratocaster headstock, but slightly taller and narrower. Prodigy electronics also differed from the Stratocaster in that the Prodigy featured a single volume and only a single tone control. Traditional Stratocasters have a single volume, but have one tone control for the neck and middle pickup and one tone control for the bridge pickup. Stratocasters also have a rout on the face of the guitar for a somewhat large, angled output jack; this is missing from the Prodigy. Instead, it uses a third hole in the pickguard (which would be used for the second tone knob on a Stratocaster) as the mounting position for the output jack. Origin While Tony Bacon's book 50 Years of Fender mentions the Prodigy as being \\"among the first Fender guitars to receive attention at the company's new factory in Ensenada, Mexico\\", the headstock is imprinted with \\"Made in U.S.A.\\" 50 years of Fender by Tony Bacon, Paul Day, page 100. Sources at Fender attribute the majority of manufacture to the Corona, California plant. prodigy1.jpgA black 1992 Fender Prodigy.

The work has been described as the height of his accomplishments in the realm of dramatic music.John Daverio: \\"Schumann, Robert\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed October 26, 2007), . The work was written between 1844 and 1853 and is scored for SATB chorus, boys' chorus, orchestra, and a number of solo parts which, even with doubling, require seven solo singers, although eight (three sopranos, two mezzos, one tenor, one baritone, and one bass) is the usual number for a performance. Schumann never saw all three parts of the work performed in the same concert, or published together. Eric Sams comments 'There is no coherence in the orchestration, which audibly dates from two different periods (hand- horns in Part III, valve-horns elsewhere)', leading him to conclude that Schumann did not conceive the work as a whole, although late nineteenth- century ideas of performance mean that in the modern era the piece is predominantly heard with all three parts. Schumann's work on what he labeled an oratorio began in 1842. This was just over a decade after the death of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who completed Part Two of the dramatic poem Faust in his final year.\\"Goethe, Johann Wolfgang van\\", The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed. (2001-2005) (Accessed October 26, 2007), . Many contemporary readers of Faust found Goethe's epic poem daunting and difficult to grasp. Goethe himself declared only Mozart fit to write the music for it (though Mozart died in 1791, almost 20 years prior to the completion of Part One of Faust). Schumann explained the weight of the task before him in an 1845 letter to Felix Mendelssohn: \\"[A]ny composer would not only be judged by his treatment of one of the seminal and most-widely acclaimed works in German literature, but would also be setting himself up to be compared to Mozart.\\"Ann Feeney: \\"Scenes from Goethe's Faust\\", All Media Guide (Accessed October 26, 2007), <>. Yet despite Schumann's expressed reservations about the work, it has been labeled his \\"magnum opus.\\" Schumann is \\"[d]eeply sensitive to the all- inclusiveness of Goethe's drama[.]\\" From the work's dark and tense overture, to its elegant and tranquil conclusion, Schumann opens wide \\"a manifold musical world\\" that coherently draws together elements of \\"lied, horror opera, grand opera, oratorio, and church music.\\" Schumann's music suggests the struggle between good and evil at the heart of Goethe's work, as well as Faust's tumultuous search for enlightenment and peace. After the overture, the music depicts Faust's wooing of Gretchen. For Gretchen's story, Schumann employs operatic music, beginning with a love duet, proceeding to Gretchen's passionate and desperate aria, and concluding with a church scene. The second part of the work opens with stark contrast: on the one hand, the lively, fresh music of Ariel and the spirits calls Faust to savor the beauties of nature; on the other hand, in the scene following, Schumann's restless orchestration brings to the fore Faust's delusions upon hearing of a new world being created and its rapturous promise of an everlasting present. The final scenes, drawing the work to its placid yet unsettled conclusion, hold some of Schumann's best choral writing. Scenes from Goethe's Faust has often been overlooked within Schumann's impressive oeuvre, but has enjoyed a resurgence since the 1970s. The piece has been deemed among Schumann's most moving works, and a pinnacle of his quintessential Romantic concern with the extra-musical (and especially literary) potential of musical expression.Brian Schlotel: \\"Schumann, Robert (Opera)\\", Grove Music Online ed.

In 1999 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and was added as a contributing property to the Irvington Historic District in 2014. From 1870 on it had been home to Lord's Horticultural Works, a builder of boilers and conservatories that had relocated to Irvington to better serve the owners of the many Hudson Valley estates who were its main clients.\\"Lord and Burnham Building\\" on the Irvington Historical Society website A fire destroyed the original building; it was replaced by the current structure. As Lord & Burnham, it continued its business until 1988. The building currently houses condominium apartments and the village's public library. Building The former factory occupies an lot at the southeast corner of the intersection, across Astor Street from the village's train station. At the west end of Irvington's downtown, the surrounding buildings on Main and Astor are primarily two-story commercial structures from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. To its south is a parking lot; additional spaces are also located along both sides of Astor to serve commuters. Across the railroad tracks are some other large industrial structures once used by Lord & Burnham, now known as the Bridge Street Properties which have also been redeveloped. The terrain is level towards the Hudson River to the west, and rises sharply to the east, reflecting the bluffs of the river. =Main block and factory wing= Three sections, all of brick laid in common bond, make up the building itself. The main block, originally the company's offices, is the six-by-six-bay four-story portion at the corner, topped by a mansard roof covered in tin shingles. At the very corner is a tower with pyramidal roof similarly clad. It is complemented by a two-bay gabled pavilion on the north facade and a similar-sized stepped-gabled pavilion on the south at the opposite ends of their respective facades. All fenestration has splayed-brick segmental-arched openings. They are mostly set with 16-over-4 double-hung sash windows; on the southernmost bay of the ground floor there is a double window. Patterned brick beltcourses delineate all three stories. Between the pavilion and tower the roof is pierced by two hipped-roofed dormer windows on either facade. The south and east elevations, away from the street, are randomly set with six-over-six double-hung sash. A sympathetic brick set of steps to what is now the library's main entrance, with a wheelchair ramp, is at the juncture between the main block and the former factory wing. It extends to the south, thirteen bays long by five wide and three stories high with a gently pitched gabled roof. Its decorative treatment is a corbelled cornice at the roofline. The modern entrance doors are located in a double-width opening repeated above it and in the third and ninth bays to its south. All windows are six-over-six double-hung sash, with some in the randomly filled bays on the south facade overlooking the parking lot. In the center of its east facade, otherwise similarly treated as the west one, is a modern three-by-three-bay full height projecting pavilion with glass facing on the north and south. =Carriage house= From the east facade of the main block a modern hyphen, not considered to be contributing to the building's historic character, connects it to the former stable/carriage house. It is a three-story brick Queen Anne structure with a gabled metal roof, stepped on the south (rear) elevation. In the gable field it is faced with scalloped wooden shingle and false half-timbering. The original vehicular entrance, on the east side of the stable's north (front) facade, has been bricked in. A round-arched pedestrian entrance and rectangular window are to the west. In the center of the second story is a projecting oriel window; each of its facets has four-over-four double-hung sash. On the third story is a group of three nine-over-six double-hung sash. The other three elevations have randomly placed windows in their brick. An exposed portion of the basement on the south elevation is concealed by a modern shed. = Interior = Inside, the building has been extensively modified from its original plan both during its days as a factory and afterwards for conversion into apartments and a library. Some original features remain in the main block. Most significant among them is the stairway at the main entrance. It has pine beadboard walls, chamfered newel posts topped by balls and molded railings. The third-floor door has its original window with 27 small glass panes and three large ones amid three wooden panels, topped by a three-light transom. Original beadboard paneling remains on the second story, along with the original window surrounds and their rosette corners. The original wooden trusses are still visible in the factory wing, making it possible to see that its third floor is carries by suspension rods from the roof trusses. The stable has been extensively modified after its original use was discontinued, but it retains its original stair as well and some of its woodwork.  History  alt=An engraving showing the factory building, surrounding neighborhood, waterfront, train station and railroad tracks In 1849 Frederick Lord, a carpenter in the upstate city of Buffalo, began building greenhouses for his customers. It became his full-time business, Lord's Horticultural Works, by 1856. He moved to Syracuse. In 1869 he took in his son-in-law, William Burnham, as a partner. He had also developed new methods of ventilating his buildings, and this led the company to enter the residential boiler market in 1873. It perfected its original cast iron sectional boiler design five years later and it became one of the top- selling models. Seven years later, in 1876, the firm moved to Irvington, close to its largest group of customers, the wealthy owners of large estates along the Hudson River north of New York City. The company worked from an existing building on the current site until it was destroyed in an 1881 fire. The current complex was built very quickly to replace it; it is not known who the architect is but it is likely that it was Frederick Lord himself. A map of the village from that year suggests that the factory wing may incorporate part of the original building. That year, the firm was also working on an important commission from railroad magnate Jay Gould. He, too, was replacing a burnt building, in his case the conservatories at Lyndhurst, his estate in nearby Tarrytown, today a National Historic Landmark (NHL). Lord built the first iron frame greenhouse in the country, revolutionizing the industry. Records from 1890 show that the company complex included a boiler shop, ironworks, carpentry shop and two lumber sheds. An insurance map says it employed 30 people. Shortly before Lord's death that year, the company name was changed to Lord & Burnham. In the years afterward it began filling in the Hudson across the tracks and building on it, expanding its facilities by about four acres () by 1895. This was the period when Lord & Burnham was the market leader in building greenhouses. In addition to Lyndhurst, the company built the Enid Haupt Conservatory at what is now the New York Botanical Garden, another NHL, and the conservatory at the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens, listed on the Register today as a contributing property to the Cazenovia Park-South Park System. By 1903 the company's catalog boasted that the Irvington plant was the country's largest greenhouse production facility. Nine years later it claimed to employ 250 there, including a design staff with 18 engineers. Burnham served as an elected village official for short periods, as did Lord's son. A closer view of the building Greenhouses were always erected at the factory before being disassembled and shipped for quality assurance purposes. The company claimed several other innovations in addition to the iron framing it had developed for Lyndhurst. It opened factories elsewhere in the country by the 1920s, and by 1930 it held nine patents related to greenhouse manufacture. During this period, greenhouse sales began to decline as only the truly wealthy could afford them. Boiler sales displaced greenhouses as the largest source of the company's profits. By the late 1940s Burnham Boilers had become a separate division headquartered in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with its casting plant in Zanesville, Ohio. The company itself moved there in 1987; by then just 12 people worked in Irvington. All greenhouse production ended the next year and the factory was closed. The village did not want the building to stay empty for long. Its public library needed more space, and plans were soon finalized to convert of the factory wing into the new library, with 22 residential units upstairs. Architect Stephen Tilly of nearby Dobbs Ferry oversaw the $2.4 million project, which was completed in 2000.

It was chaired by Roy Plomley, with a musical mistakes round supplied by Steve Race. The title of the show is a reference to the English proverb \\"There's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip\\". The BBC received requests from school teachers and lecturers for transcripts of Ian Messiter's pieces as a fun way of teaching educational subjects to pupils. Contestants For the first couple of series, the contestants were Isobel Barnett and Eleanor Summerfield versus Richard Murdoch and Lance Percival. Temporary replacements for Lance Percival in the first series (each for one show) were Kenneth Horne, Terence Alexander and Jon Pertwee. When the annual radio series returned, magician David Nixon replaced Lance Percival. When Nixon died in 1978, Percival returned to the show, In the early 1970s, Isobel Barnett and Richard Murdoch were replaced by Katharine Whitehorn and Paul Jennings. The new panellists were replaced after only one series by Tim Rice and Gillian Reynolds who remained until the show ended in 1979. Over 250 shows were recorded. Roy Plomley was in every show but Steve Race missed a few shows due to illness and was replaced by pianist Alan Paul. Eleanor Summerfield only missed two shows; her temporary replacement was Andr√©e Melly. The only other stand-in player for one show was Graeme Garden. Format In a typical round, Plomley read out a piece of text prepared by Messiter, and contestants buzzed in if they detected an error. Correctly identifying an error scored one point and supplying a correction was worth a second; if a contestant buzzed in when there was no error, two points were awarded to the opposing team. Occasionally a third point was awarded when a contestant spotted a mistake Messiter had not intended. Mid-way through each show, for one round, Plomley handed over to \\"our musical mistakes man, Steve Race\\", who would play short extracts from well-known pieces of music, each preceded by a spoken introduction, while contestants attempted to detect errors in the introduction, the piece, or both. A regular feature was a memory round: Plomley read a short piece, usually of verse or song lyrics, then read it again later on in the show with funny alterations which the teams scored points for correcting. Other regular features were the Many a Slip library with its books of incorrect titles and authors; a murder mystery round with the Many a Slip detective; travelogues of different countries and the Many a Slip chef and his way of cooking with ingredients that no sane chef would use. For each series, the chairman kept a running total of how many games each team had won and in the last show he announced which team had won the series. Broadcast information From its inception in 1964, Many a Slip was broadcast on the BBC Light Programme, with the programme repeated the same week on the BBC Home Service. In July 1969, this changed, with the original broadcast now on BBC Radio 4 and the repeats on BBC Radio 2. Radio 2 stopped broadcasting the weekly repeats in 1970. The BBC's archive digital radio station, BBC Radio 4 Extra, occasionally broadcasts repeats of the show. The show was played on Saturday nights on RNZ National (then known as National Radio) in New Zealand in the 1980s. Other versions and connections to other shows In the mid-1960s, Many a Slip was tried out on television for one series. Peter Haigh took over as chairman and Steve Race's contribution was replaced by a spot the mistakes in the picture round, but it was deemed too static for TV. Personnel from Many a Slip took part in two special editions of Brain of Britain in which they were pitted against the current year's Brain of Brains. The first, in 1970, featured Eleanor Summerfield, Richard Murdoch and Roy Plomley and was chaired by Franklin Engelmann. The second, in 1976, featured Eleanor Summerfield, David Nixon, Tim Rice and Gillian Reynolds and was chaired by Robert Robinson. In the first series of Just a Minute after Kenneth Williams died in 1988, for a double recording at the Paris Studio in Lower Regent Street (the home of many Many a Slip recordings), Many a Slip one-time team-mates Richard Murdoch and Lance Percival were reunited to do battle against Clement Freud and Wendy Richard in another of Ian Messiter's panel games. Richard Murdoch remained a regular guest on Just a Minute till he died in the early 1990s. In the late 1990s, the BBC recorded a pilot of Many a Slip at the Radio Theatre in Broadcasting House. The show's new host was one-time fill-in panellist Graeme Garden. The teams were Helen Lederer and Lorelei King versus Miles Kington and David Stafford. The show had a new musical mistakes man at the piano. Theme music The theme music for the series was composed by John Baker at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.

Unlike other fantasy novels where there was a definite plot, this novel subtly examines various themes of prejudice, artistic aspirations versus pragmatism, stoic acceptance of life and the right of a man to enjoy simple freedom, without weaving a grand major plot. Characters Limper was the smith of King of Eshgorin. Dissatisfied with the work assigned to him by the king, he quit. But in his world, quitting is only possible if the king is not able to get his hands on him. Despite being not a fighter and having a limp, Limper demonstrated wit and a strong instinct for survival necessary in his pursuit to follow his own path. Nargri is a young dragon companion of Limper. In this world, adult dragons were the size of adult humans, but were supposedly of more advanced, having built cities when humans were still living in crude mud huts.

It was declared an Alabama Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1979 and a National Historic Landmark in 1985. It is located at NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama on the Redstone Arsenal, designated Building 4665. The Redstone missile was the first missile to detonate a nuclear weapon. Jupiter-C launched to test components for the Jupiter missile. Juno I put the first American satellite Explorer 1 into orbit. Mercury Redstone carried the first American astronaut Alan Shepard into space. The Redstone earned the name \\"Old Reliable\\" because of this facility and the improvements it made possible. The Interim Test Stand was built in 1953 by Dr. Wernher von Braun's team for a mere out of materials salvaged from the Redstone Arsenal. In 1957 the permanent test facility called the Static Test Tower was finally finished, but the Army decided to continue operations at the Interim Test Stand rather than move. From 1953 to 1961, 362 static rocket tests were conducted there, including 200 that led directly to improvements in the Redstone rocket for the Mercury manned flight program. Adapted over the years, it never experienced the growth in size and cost that typified test stands in general, remaining a testament to the engineering ingenuity of the rocket pioneers. Background Liquid- propellant rocket development has always proceeded in three steps: # Engine testing # Static rocket testing # Test launches. First, prototype engines are tested in a Rocket engine test facility, where the most promising designs are refined during a period of extensive testing. After an engine has been proven, the complete rocket is assembled. In this second step, the rocket is anchored to a static test stand. With the rocket held down, engineers run the engine at full power and refine the system. The test launch is third, when the missile is fired into the sky. Wernher von Braun and his team used this process to develop the V-2 or A4 missile in Germany during WWII. Von Braun and members of his team decided to surrender to the United States military to ensure they were not captured by the advancing Soviets or shot by the Nazis to prevent their capture. They came to the United States via Operation Paperclip. The Army first assigned the Germans to teach German missile technology, assist with the launching of captured V-2's, and continue rocket research as part of the Hermes project at Fort Bliss, Texas and White Sands Proving Grounds On April 15, 1950, the Army consolidated their far-flung guided missile and rocket research and development efforts into the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) at Redstone Arsenal. The Army bought the former WWII munitions facility from the Army Chemical Corps. That summer and fall, members of the German rocket team moved from Fort Bliss to Huntsville. They conducted a preliminary study for proposed range missiles and began developing one, called Hermes C-1. The study envisioned warhead payloads of , with the first test launch in 20 months. Cold War tensions escalated by the Korean War drove the payload up to a atomic bomb with a reduced range. The system with its new specifications took the name Redstone, and had to be highly reliable, accurate, and quickly produced, priority 1A. The development program for the Redstone began in earnest on May 1, 1951. Separate from the missile development program, another budget line item was to bear the cost of constructing facilities for research and development at Redstone Arsenal because those facilities could also be used for other projects. However, the construction of facilities was not funded. Early development, 1952‚Äì1955 Drawings of buried railroad tanker vessels used as bunkers for instrumentation and control. Note periscopes in right tank The first twelve missiles were built at Redstone Arsenal. Assembly of the first Redstone began in the fall of 1952. Engineers needed a propulsion test stand to improve the missile, but they were not allowed to spend research and development funds on constructing facilities even for a cause vital to national security. Rather than wait for funding to go through the two-year Congressional appropriation process, then wait further for construction, Fritz A. Vandersee designed an interim test stand for $25,000, the maximum amount allowed. The large concrete foundation cost nearly all of the money. On this base, welders built a small stand with metal salvaged from around the arsenal. Three railroad tank cars that had been used to transport chemicals at the arsenal during the war were cleaned, modified, and buried away to serve as control and observation bunkers. To view the firings, the tanks also contain two periscopes believed to have been from two surplus Army tanks.bunker entrance in 2017 When workers assembled the first Redstone missile at Redstone Arsenal in spring of 1953, the Redstone Interim Test Stand stood ready. A crane hoisted the missile (without the warhead) onto the stand and placed a frame atop the missile. Cables were attached to the frame to steady the missile. After extensive tests, workers fueled the missile and fired the engine for tests lasting no more than 15 seconds. After several successful test runs, the missile went to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for the test flight. Launches provided valuable information on the guidance system, but most improvements on the propulsion system came from lessons learned at the Interim Test Stand, where engineers could evaluate the internal workings of the propulsion system while it was firmly anchored to the ground. A total of fourteen tests were performed with the first four missiles. Redstone Test Stand during gmissile test #02 Before congressional appropriation and construction of permanent facilities was completed, the engineers used the information gained during static testing at the Interim Stand to steadily improve the Redstone system. The next eight missiles stood for twenty-two tests. The tower to the left of the missile (shown above right) is the Cold Calibration Unit, built in 1954. It held only the Redstone's alcohol and liquid oxygen tanks, pumps, valves and flow meters in various configurations. The liquids flowed into another set of tanks and were used to test and calibrate the valves and flow meters to assure that accurate measurements were made during the static fire testing and to assure a proper alcohol to oxygen mixture ratio. Oxygen-rich propellant mixtures had caused most engine explosions in the early years of liquid rocket development. In the original version of the facility, flames were directed in a trench beneath the rocket in two opposite directions. In December 1955, workers installed a new more durable elbow-shaped flame deflector designed by Rocketdyne engineer Carl Kassner. Water injected through small holes in the elbow quickly turned to steam, keeping the flame away from the metal elbow. Army Ballistic Missile Agency, 1956‚Äì1958 The Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) was established on February 1, 1956 to turn the experimental Redstone rocket into an operational weapon and to develop a new Jupiter Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM). The Redstone missile development continued with routine missile qualification tests and several improvements were made to the Interim Test Stand. A load cell was added to directly measure the thrust of the missile. A cutoff system was added to detect rough combustion in the engine and automatically stop tests. This system prevented engine damage while engineers solved the problem. The first Redstone built by Chrysler was tested at the Interim Stand. Chrysler built thirty-eight developmental Redstone missiles and all sixty-three tactical Redstones in Detroit. In addition, several of the Redstone missiles were modified to aid the Jupiter missile development program. These longer missiles were called Jupiter-C and test fired on the Interim Stand after it was enlarged and strengthened. A series of tests using propellants chilled to established that the Redstone could be deployed in the Arctic. In 1957 the permanent Propulsion and Structural Test Facility was finally completed using the funds appropriated by Congress for the Redstone, but the ABMA decided to continue using the Interim Test Stand for the Redstone. After four years of development, the interim facilities had proven adequate for testing the Redstone and Jupiter-C, and the Army felt that a move to the new facilities would be disruptive to its busy schedule. Juno I awaiting launch with Explorer I Dr. von Braun had proposed to Project Orbiter using a Redstone as the main booster for launching artificial satellites on June 25, 1954. The day Sputnik 1 launched, October 4, 1957, von Braun had been showing incoming Defense Secretary Neil McElroy around the Redstone Arsenal. They received the news about Sputnik as they relaxed that afternoon. Von Braun turned to McElroy. \\"We could have been in orbit a year ago,\\" he said. \\"We knew they [the Soviets] were going to do it! Vanguard will never make it. We have the hardware on the shelf‚Ä¶ We can put up a satellite in 60 days.\\" McElroy was not confirmed until the next week and did not have the power to back their proposal. On November 8, McElroy directed the Army to modify two Jupiter-C missiles and to place a satellite in orbit by March 1958. The first stage was soon test fired. Eighty-four days later, on January 31, 1958, the ABMA launched the first US satellite, Explorer I, into orbit. Following this successful launch, five more of these modified Jupiter-C missiles (subsequently re-designated Juno I) were launched in attempts to place additional Explorer satellites in orbit. During this satellite program, the Department of the Army gathered a great deal of knowledge about space. Explorer I gathered and transmitted data on atmospheric densities and the earth's oblateness. It is primarily remembered, though, as the discoverer of the Van Allen cosmic radiation belt. Because of its proven reliability and accuracy, the Department of Defense decided to use the Redstone missile in tests to study the effects of nuclear detonations in the upper atmosphere, Operation Hardtack I. After being static-fired at the Interim Stand in January 1958, two missiles were shipped to the Pacific Test Range. In July and August, the missiles became the first missiles ever to detonate atomic warheads. In 1958, Redstone development ended and Chrysler began mass production for deployment. Only a few of these missiles were tested at the Interim Test Stand because the propulsion system had become so reliable. Mercury-Redstone, 1959‚Äì1960 Installation of a Mercury capsule on the Mercury-Redstone Test Booster (TB) for Full (110-116 sec) runs, May 1960 As the space race continued, the civilian space agency, NASA started on October 1, 1958 but the Army kept von Braun and the ABMA for another year and a half. NASA's Project Mercury chose the \\"Old Reliable\\" Redstone, with its unmatched launch record, as America's first manned launch vehicle. Nevertheless, the Army had to make improvements for manned missions. The crew at the Interim Test Stand ran over 200 static firings to improve the Redstone propulsion system. In addition, all eight Mercury-Redstone launch vehicles endured a full duration acceptance test at the interim stand. On July 1, 1960, 4,670 people transferred from the ABMA to NASA forming the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The first test flight, Mercury-Redstone 1, occurred on November 21, 1960. After rising a few inches off the launch pad, electrical cables disconnecting in the wrong order caused the engine to shut down. The launch vehicle sustained minor damage and was returned to MSFC. Static fire testing on the Redstone Test Stand in February 1961 verified that repairs were successful. The second test launch, Mercury-Redstone 1A, was successful on December 19, 1960. On January 31, 1961, a chimpanzee named Ham flew into space on Mercury-Redstone 2. Another test flight, Mercury-Redstone BD, added to evaluate changes, confirmed the system was ready. Alan B. Shepard, Jr. became the first American in space on May 5, 1961. Mercury-Redstone 3 was a suborbital flight to an altitude of 115 miles and a range of 302 miles. This flight demonstrated that man was capable of controlling a space vehicle during periods of weightlessness and high accelerations. The last Mercury-Redstone flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, also a manned suborbital flight, carried Virgil I. Grissom to a peak altitude of 118 miles and safely landed him 303 miles downrange. The Redstone Test Stand contributed to the success of the first two Americans to fly in space. Epilogue right The Redstone Test Stand phased out of use in October, 1961. After becoming rundown and littered, the site was restored for the US Bicentennial. A Redstone missile, which US Army Missile Command (MICOM) loaned to NASA, was installed on February 27, 1976. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as being nationally significant on May 13, 1976. Alabama Section, American Society of Civil Engineers declared it an Alabama Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1979. It was declared a National Historic Landmark on October 3, 1985.

It was discovered in 2005 during structure-activity relationship studies into neoclerodane diterpenes, the family of chemical compounds of which Salvinorin A is a member. Unlike Salvinorin A which is a selective Œ∫-opioid agonist with no significant Œº-opioid receptor affinity, herkinorin is a Œº-opioid agonist with more than 100x higher Œº-opioid affinity and 50x lower Œ∫-opioid affinity compared to Salvinorin A. Herkinorin is a semi-synthetic compound, made from Salvinorin B, which is most conveniently made from Salvinorin A by deacetylation, as while both Salvinorin A and Salvinorin B are found in the plant Salvia divinorum, Salvinorin A is present in larger quantities. A study in primates showed it to act as both a peripherally active Œº and Œ∫ agonist with a fast onset of action. The study did not find any evidence of central activity in primates and questions whether herkinorin's effects are due entirely to peripheral binding. Unlike most Œº-opioid agonists, herkinorin does not promote the recruitment of Œ≤-arrestin-2 to the intracellular domain of the Œº-opioid receptor, or induce receptor internalization. This means that herkinorin may not produce tolerance and dependence in the same way as other opioids, although some development of tolerance through other mechanisms has been observed, and some other analogues related to herkinorin can recruit Œ≤-arrestins.

The two railways made an end on junction here. It was the site of the lines' engine shed, also a china clay works which is now used as a cement terminal. History A 1905 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (lower right) railways in the vicinity of Moorswater The Liskeard and Caradon Railway was opened on 28 November 1844 from quarries on the moors north of Liskeard to Moorswater where goods were transshipped to the Liskeard and Looe Union Canal. At Looe they could then be transhipped again to sea-going vessels for transport further around the coast. The canal was superseded by a railway on 27 December 1860 and passengers were carried on the Moorswater to Looe section from 11 September 1879. The Cornwall Railway, which opened in 1859, had intended to make a junction with the Liskeard and Caradon Railway near Moorswater but a lack of capital saw this scheme abandoned, the line passing high above the goods yard on the Moorswater Viaduct. The new station, which was situated just north of the viaduct, was used by passengers travelling into Liskeard, but from 1896 a platform was provided at Coombe where trains would call to set down passengers going to Liskeard railway station if they notified the guard, as the steep road from there to the station was considerably shorter than the route from Moorswater. On 15 May 1901 passenger trains from Looe were diverted over the new loop line to Liskeard railway station and Moorswater station closed to passengers. Goods traffic has continued - on and off - up to the present day. A siding for the Cheesewring Quarry Company opposite the station was later used by the Cornwall County Council as a road maintenance depot until 1964. Beyond the station another siding lead into the china clay works of the St Neots China Clay Company where china clay was processed that was brought down from Bodmin Moor by pipeline before being dispatched as powder to Looe or, later, Fowey. This was opened in 1904 and closed in the 1990s but the site has since been used as a cement distribution depot and trains are brought in from time to time, the motive power being initially provided by Freightliner but more recently by Colas Rail. Engine shed The engine shed was situated between the Caradon line and the china clay siding. It was inside with a small workshop beyond. On the west side was another workshop that maintained the wagons and carriages before the line was connected to the Great Western Railway, although passenger trains were normally kept in another shed at Looe. In Great Western Railway days the shed was home to two locomotives, normally as an outstation from St Blazey engine shed or, for a few years, Laira TMD. 0-6-0STs of 850 and 2021 classes gave way in 1924 to larger 2-6-2Ts of GWR 4400 Class and then 4500 and 4575 classes. The shed closed on 11 September 1961 after which the branch was worked by DMUs and British Rail Class 22 diesel locomotives. Accident On 15 June 1906 an accident occurred at Moorswater. Six empty carriages from an excursion had been taken up to Liskeard but a mishap during uncoupling the locomotive saw the carriages pushed back onto the branch where they ran away down the steep gradient. At Coombe a collision was avoided by the signalman at Liskeard warning his colleague at Coombe Junction; a passenger train from Looe was stopped at the junction signals. The carriages were estimated to pass through the station at over 60 mph (100 km/h) and ran through to Moorswater, where they collided with other carriages in the shed. All were damaged beyond repair. Cultural impact Moorswater is one of the stations named in Bernard Moore's poem Travelling.

Extensive management work was carried out and a way-marked series of paths were created accessible from the Cotswold Way national trail. The character of this wood was changed dramatically in the 1950s and subsequently by replacing with conifers following felling of mature Oak, Ash, Beech and many diseased Elms. Replanting work has replaced conifers for broad- leaf. A good ground flora is present mostly in the broad-leaved areas. Bluebell, Yellow Archangel, Wood Anemone, Moschatel, Early-purple Orchid and Ramsons (wood garlic). There are Roman Snails in a site of a Roman Settlement in the north of the wood. The Common Dormouse is present as are Roe and Muntjac deer. There is currently no lease agreement for these areas with the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. =Publications= * Atty, D, Haigh, D J R, Holland, Sonia, Long, D C, Porter, Steve (edited Miller, John, illustrated Ball, Arthur), October 1987, 'Plants and Animals of the Dowdeswell Reservoir Nature Reserve', Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation * Ball, Arthur, Barber, Bruce, undated, 'The Birds of Dowdeswell Reservoir Nature Reserve', The Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation * Ball, Arthur, 1987 to 2016, Dowdeswell Reservoir Nature Reserve Annual Bird Reports * Crayfish Consultants International Ltd, 'Conservation of the native crayfish population at Dowdeswell Reservoir during engineering works', March 1998, prepared for Severn Trent Water (Conservation Officer: Jan Phillips) * Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation, 'Management Plan for Dowdeswell Reservoir Nature Reserve', 1975, commissioned by The North West Gloucestershire Water Board. * Gloucestershire Wildlife Management, 'Dowdeswell Wood Nature Reserve - Site Management Plan', 1993-2002 & 2002-2011, commissioned by Severn Trent Water Limited * Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al., 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, 'Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust' (includes Dowdeswell Reservoir and Dowdeswell Wood entries) Reference List External links * Environment Agency * Severn Trent * Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust Category:Cheltenham Category:Cotswold District Category:Reservoirs in Gloucestershire Category:Former drinking water reservoirs in England Category:Cotswolds Category:Nature reserves in Gloucestershire Category:Forests and woodlands of Gloucestershire ","title":"Dowdeswell Reservoir"},{"id":"13921998","text":"Carl Hansen Ostenfeld Carl Emil Hansen Ostenfeld (born Carl Emil Ostenfeld- Hansen) (3 August 1873 - 16 January 1931) was a Danish systematic botanist. He graduated from the University of Copenhagen under professor Eugenius Warming. He was a keeper at the Botanical Museum 1900-1918, when he became professor of botany at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University. In 1923, by the early retirement of Raunki√¶r's, Ostenfeld became professor of botany at the University of Copenhagen and director of the Copenhagen Botanical Garden, both positions held until his death in 1931.Paulsen, Ove, 1931. C.H. Ostenfeld. Botanisk Tidsskrift, bd. 41. He was a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters and served on the board of directors of the Carlsberg Foundation.

Ostenfeld participated in the Ingolf expedition (1885-86) to the waters around Iceland and Greenland, and in 1911 in the International Phytogeographic Excursion to the British Isles. The party studied the flora of parts of Ireland, including Killarney, Connemara and The Burren. In collaboration with O. Rosenberg, he was one of the first to confirm that some plants could form asexual seeds, now called (apomixis). Their experiments repeated those of Gregor Mendel with Hieracium hybrids, showing that Mendel had observed a mixture of sexual recombination and apomixis.

Life and career Rouse was the son of film pioneer Edwin Russell; his great uncle was the 1920s actor William Russell. He was educated at UCLA. His first employment in films was in the prop department at Paramount Studios, where he began writing screenplays. His play, Yokel Boy, was filmed in 1942 and became his first film writing credit. Rouse has 18 credits as a screenwriter between 1942 and 1988. Commencing with his third writing credit, The Town Went Wild (1944), Rouse co-wrote many stories and scripts with Clarence Greene. The partners are noted for their work on a series of six film noir movies commencing with D.O.A. (directed by Rudolph Mat√©-1949). With the second film in the series, The Well (1951), they also took on directing and producing: Rouse as director, and Greene as producer. This collaboration continued through the noir series (The Thief (1952), Wicked Woman (1953), New York Confidential (1955), and House of Numbers (1957)) and beyond. In the late 1950s Greene and Rouse formed a production company, Greene-Rouse Productions, which created the film noir television series Tightrope that ran for one season (1959‚Äì60) as well as two films in the 1960s. In addition to their noir work, Rouse and Greene produced two westerns (The Fastest Gun Alive (1956) and Thunder in the Sun (1959). The 1959 film, Pillow Talk, was based on their story. Their careers drew to a close shortly after the unsuccessful film, The Oscar (1966). Rouse and Greene were nominated for the Academy Award for writing The Well (1951). They received the Academy Award for Pillow Talk (1959) (with Maurice Richlin and Stanley Shapiro). D.O.A. has been preserved in the National Film Registry. That film has also been remade several times, and they were credited as writers on two of them: the Australian remake Color Me Dead from 1969 and the D.O.A. remake of 1988. In the mid-1950s, Rouse married actress Beverly Michaels. Several offline sources are noted in this web chronology, including . Their son Christopher Rouse (b. 1958) is a noted film editor. He died on October 2, 1987, in Los Angeles, California, and he was cremated with his ashes scattered at sea.

The \\"gaudy plastic jewelry, toys, and other mementos [are] tossed to the crowds from parading floats\\". The 'throws', consist of necklaces of plastic beads, coins called doubloons, which are stamped with krewes' logos, parade themes and the year, plus an array of plastic cups and toys such as Frisbees, figurines and LED trinkets. The plastic cups that are used as throws are sometimes referred to as New Orleans dinnerware. Beads used on Mardis Gras (known as Shrove Tuesday in some regions) are purple, green, and gold, with these three colors containing the Christian symbolism of justice, faith, and power, respectively. Traditionally, Mardis Gras beads were manufactured in Japan and Czech Republic, although many are now imported from mainland China. As Fat Tuesday concludes the period of Carnival (Shrovetide), Mardis Gras beads are taken off oneself on the following day, Ash Wednesday, which begins the penitential season of Lent. As such, one of the \\"solemn practices of Ash Wednesday is to pack all the beads acquired during the parade season into bags and boxes and taken them to the attic\\". Spectators have traditionally shouted to the krewe members, \\"Throw me something, mister!\\", a phrase that is iconic in New Orleans' Mardi Gras street argot. Some women expose their breasts to invite throws in the French Quarter, although this is not required or even classed as a true Mardi Gras tradition, it is however quite common during French Quarter parades.Shrum, W. and J.

The Other Side follows Samuel North (Nathan Mobley) who escapes from Hell to find the person who murdered him, but a team of invincible bounty hunters called Reapers are sent from the Netherworld to bring him back. After graduating from the University of Southern California filmschool, Bishop took the profits he made from his short film Voodoo and financed his first feature film The Other Side himself with $15,000. The supernatural action/thriller starred Jaimie Alexander in her first leading role and premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah where it was acquired for a 2007 theatrical release for an undisclosed amount. In 2019, Bishop began developing the movie as a TV series.  Plot  Samuel North has returned from college to reunite with his girlfriend Hanna Thompson. On the night he is to have a romantic dinner with her on the banks of a river she does not show up, and he is run into the river by a large white van. His soul goes to Hell, aka \\"The Pit,\\" where he is tormented by the worst memories of his life, including being bullied, finding his parents murdered, and the regretful taxi ride to college, which took him from Hanna. However, he experiences only a moment of torment before being rescued by other souls who have found a way out. He escapes and wakes up along with the other escapees in a hospital, where he learns that Hanna did not return home the previous night, and he is a suspect for her disappearance. Before he can find out any more, three bounty hunters dispatched from hell to retrieve them appear. Only Sam and two others escape. The duo, Mally and Oz, have both escaped numerous times only to be caught and brought back. They explain that two of the three bounty hunters are \\"Switchers,\\" who can switch from dead body to body when their host body is killed. However their leader, a \\"Changer,\\" does not need to change unless into its native demonic form. They escape to a motel filled with escapees, all scarred by the Mark of the Damned, which is how the Reapers track them. Mally and Oz originally plan to escape to Mexico; however, Sam is determined to find Hanna. Mally wants to flee to Mexico, but Oz decides to help Sam find Hanna, believing that helping him may be their ticket to Redemption and out of The Pit for good. Mally relents and the trio go to the bar where Hanna worked. Sam discovers that Hanna was being sexually harassed by a regular named Isaac, and that one of Hanna's friends had told Isaac that Hanna was reporting him to the police. The friend further explains that Isaac followed Hanna out to her car and didn't return home that night. The trio find Hanna's car in the woods near the river and a dead body next to it. Sam's police friend, Peter, informs him the dead body was John Rice, who drove a white van. However, he was pulled over and stabbed to death and his white van was hijacked. Later that night, while picking up a few items from his brother, David, Sam is shot at by a man in the white van and his brother is injured. After dropping David off at the Emergency Room he breaks into Isaac's house and interrogates him, only to receive a truthful answer that Isaac left Hanna alone. Sam returns to the motel just before it is attacked by the Reapers. Although many escapees are killed and sent back to The Pit, they succeed in sending one Switcher back to Hell. Mally and Oz, tired of fighting, decide to leave for Mexico. But before they can leave Sam reveals the sin for which he went to Hell: murder. Despite this, Oz and Mally leave Sam alone to fight the Reapers. Later on Sam is attacked by the Reapers, but manages to send another Switcher back to Hell. Meanwhile, Hanna's body is found in a river, and the search is called off. David, meanwhile, is let out of the hospital, and Peter offers to drive him home. On the way he sees the white van and finds the driver has entered a motel. Before he can call in backup, David shoots and kills him and confronts the man in the white van. It is revealed that David hired the man to kill Hanna and Sam. He berates him for being careless and not burying the body and ditching the van. The man forces David to arrange a meeting at the Church between him and Sam. They meet, and it is revealed the man is William Cain, the man who murdered Sam's parents and who Sam‚Äîin revenge‚Äîkilled as he was trying to escape. William also escaped from Hell and offered to kill Sam and Hanna so that David could claim the inheritance, because their parent's will left everything to Sam, and Sam's will left everything to Hanna. Before Will can kill Sam, the final Reaper‚Äîthe Changer‚Äîarrives and attacks both of them and kills William, but not before he tells Sam that David hired him to kill him. Now in its natural form the Changer nearly kills Sam before being killed by Mally and Oz, who have returned. Oz confesses that Sam didn't escape by accident and was in fact broken out by Oz, who is a Guardian Angel. He offers to take Sam down to Mexico, but Sam stays to confront his brother. David admits not only to having Will kill Sam and Hanna but also having their parents murdered by Will because he was jealous of both his parents' treatment of Sam as well as the inheritance money. Following their argument, Sam is shot by David. In a brief struggle Sam gains the upper hand and spares his brother, only to be shot in the back as he is leaving. As the police arrive to arrest David, Sam has the opportunity to fire back at David; however, he instead spends his final moments staring at a picture of him and Hanna happily together. For this act Sam gains redemption for his previous sin. After he dies, he awakens in heaven with Hanna, where they spend the rest of eternity happily ever after.

The movie was shot in Atlanta on Super 16mm with a skeleton crew using borrowed equipment and film gear. Reception The film premiered to mostly positive reviews. Variety called \\"'The Other Side' a lean, propulsively paced supernatural thriller, packed with pulse pounding excitement‚Äù and Scott Weinberg of efilmcritic.com gave the movie a 4/5 and says the movie is \\"fast- paced, creative, and entertaining. It's like an equivalent of an overstuffed Halloween goody bag that's been spilled all over the carpet.

Early years Bertha Henry Leupold was born on 26 July 1844, and when only a girl of eleven years amused herself by writing stories for her schoolfellows at Queen's College, Tufnell Park, London. Both her parents were Germans. Her father, William Leupold (sometimes spelt Leopold), was a London merchant, her mother being Madame Therese Leupold, well known in musical circles, and with them she travelled in America, Germany, and Holland during her fourteenth and fifteenth years. Career At sixteen, she married Henry Buxton, club manager and author, but still pursued her literary work as an amusement, translating a German operetta into English, and writing a modest one-volume novel, published at her husband's expense, under the title of Percy's Wife. After fifteen years of marriage he became bankrupt and deserted her and her children.Women in the Literary Marketplace 1800‚Äì1900 http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/womenLit/getting_into_print/Buxton_L.htm In 1875, she suddenly found herself poverty-stricken, and, becoming entirely dependent on her own exertions, she turned to writing for a living. In 1876 appeared her novel, Jennie of the Prince's, by B. H. B. dealing with theatrical life, which she had studied as a walking lady on the stage at Exeter. The book was a success. She wrote a serial for the World during the following year, bringing out during the same period Won! By the Author of \\"Jennie of the Prince's\\", and a story for children entitled Rosabella, published under the name of Auntie Bee. From this period she wrote under her own name, and the following Christmas brought out another child's book, entitled More Dolls, illustrated by Mr. T. D. White, and dedicated to the Princess of Wales. Shortly afterwards, Buxton met with an accident which rendered work impossible. Somewhat recovering, she produced Fetterless though Bound together (1879); Great Grenfell Gardens (1879); Nell‚ÄîOn and Off the Stage; and From the Wings (1880). The last two novels first appeared in Tinsley's Magazine. Her other books were Many Loves (1880), Little Pops, a nursery romance (1881), and Sceptre and King (1881). In collaboration with blind author William Willhem Fenn, she brought out Oliver Gay, a Rattling Story of Field, Fright, and Fight, in 1880, and a tale called A Noble Name in a volume published by him in 1883. She died very suddenly from heart disease, at Claremont Villa, 12 St. Mary's Terrace, Kensington, London, on 31 March 1881.

It is estimated in his 45-year career he carried out 450 executions. A cobbler by trade, Calcraft was initially recruited to flog juvenile offenders held in Newgate Prison. While selling meat pies on streets around the prison, Calcraft met the City of London's hangman, John Foxton. After Foxton's death in 1829 the government appointed Calcraft the official Executioner for the City of London and Middlesex. Following this, his executioner services were in great demand throughout England. Nevertheless, some considered Calcraft incompetent, in particular for his controversial use of the short-drop hanging method in which the condemned were slowly strangled to death. Because with Calcraft's methods the condemned took several minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would sometimes dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders in an effort to break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly to entertain the crowds, sometimes numbering 30,000 spectators or more. Executions in England were public until 1868. That year the law changed, mandating executions would take place privately and inside the prison. In 1868 Calcraft carried out the last public and first private executions. Among his executions were Marie and Frederick Manning, the first husband and wife to be hanged together since 1700. Early life Calcraft was born in Baddow, near Chelmsford, in 1800. He was a cobbler by trade, but had also worked as a nightwatchman at Reid's brewery in Clerkenwell, London. While attempting to earn a living by selling meat pies on the streets around Newgate Prison he made the acquaintance of John Foxton, who was the City of London's hangman for 40 years. That meeting led to his employment at Newgate to flog juvenile offenders, for which he was paid 10 shillings a week. Career as an executioner, 1829‚Äì1874 Newgate Prison in the mid-19th century. Between 1783 and 1868 all public executions in London took place on a temporary gallows erected in front of the prison. Foxton died on 14 February 1829, and Calcraft was appointed as his successor. He was sworn in as the official Executioner for the City of London and Middlesex on 4 April 1829, a position for which he was paid one guinea a week plus an additional guinea for each execution. He also received an allowance for cats o' nine tails and birch rods, and supplemented his income by selling sections of the rope used to hang his victims, for which he charged between five shillings and ¬£1 per inch. Calcraft's first duty in his new role was the execution of Thomas Lister and George Wingfield, hanged together on 27 March 1829, Lister for burglary and Wingfield for highway robbery. Esther Hibner, known in the press as the \\"Evil Monster\\", was the first woman hanged by Calcraft. She was executed on 13 April 1829, having been found guilty of starving to death her apprentice, Frances Colppits. Hibner did not go to the scaffold willingly, but had to be restrained in a straitjacket to prevent her from attacking her executioners. As she was hanged the watching crowd shouted out \\"Three cheers for the Hangman!\\" Calcraft was \\"in great demand\\" as an executioner elsewhere in the country as well, such as at Reading Gaol. During his tenure of office the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 was passed, requiring that all executions must be conducted in private. Calcraft carried out the last public execution in Britain on 26 May 1868, when he hanged the Fenian Michael Barrett in front of Newgate Prison for his part in the Clerkenwell Outrage. Calcraft also carried out the first private execution in Britain under the new law. Eighteen-year-old Thomas Wells, who had been convicted of the murder of his superior Edward Walshe, the stationmaster at Dover Priory railway station, was hanged on 13 August 1868 in a former timber yard inside Maidstone Gaol. Members of the press were allowed to attend and reported that Wells, who wore his railway porter's uniform, did not die quickly, \\"struggling on the end of the rope for several minutes\\". Calcraft's final official duty was the hanging of James Godwin, on 25 May 1874. Reporting on Calcraft's visit to Dundee to perform an execution in that city in April 1873, The Times newspaper observed that \\"if their visitor had been a Royal personage, or an eminent statesman he could hardly have been treated with greater consideration\\". They further reported that Calcraft arrived with only one piece of hand luggage, a carpet bag containing \\"a new rope, a white cap, and some pinioning straps\\". The number of executions Calcraft carried out is unrecorded, but it has been estimated at 450, of whom 35 were women, making him one of the most active of British executioners. Among his better-known victims was Fran√ßois Courvoisier, executed on 6 July 1840 outside Newgate Prison. Courvoisier had been valet to Lord William Russell, and had murdered his master after being caught stealing silverware from the household.Wilson, p. 336 Calcraft officiated at one of the very few executions of a husband and wife, and the first since 1700, when he hanged Marie and Frederick Manning at Horsemonger Lane Gaol on 13 November 1849. The couple had murdered Marie's wealthy lover, Patrick O'Connor, with the aim of stealing his money. Calcraft also officiated at the last public execution of a woman in Britain, Frances Kidder, who was hanged on 2 April 1868. Convicted of drowning her stepdaughter, she was executed in front of a crowd of 2,000, amongst whom was reported to be her husband. After her drop of she struggled for \\"two or three minutes\\" before expiring. =Technique= Although Calcraft's career as a hangman spanned 45 years, he appears to have been \\"particularly incompetent\\", frequently having to \\"rush below the scaffold to pull on his victim's legs to hasten death\\". Those being hanged had their arms pinioned to their sides with leather straps before being walked to the gallows, where they were placed on a trapdoor and their heads and faces covered with a white cap, or hood. The purpose of the hood was to prevent the prisoner seeing the hangman pull the lever that released the trapdoor ‚Äì and thus attempting to jump at the critical moment ‚Äì and to hide from spectators any agony on the dying prisoner's face. After the noose had been secured around each victim's neck and the hangman had retired to a safe distance, the trapdoor was released. The bodies were left hanging for some time to ensure that death had occurred, before being lowered to the ground. Calcraft employed the short-drop method of execution, in which the drop through the trapdoor might be around or so. That was often insufficient to break the prisoner's neck, and therefore death was not always instantaneous, typically occurring slowly by strangulation. Historians Anthony Stokes and Theodore Dalrymple have suggested that Calcraft's \\"controversial\\" use of the short-drop allowed him a couple of minutes to entertain the large crowds of 30,000 plus that sometimes attended his public executions. \\"Renowned for his poor taste\\", he would sometimes swing from his victim's legs or climb onto their shoulders in an attempt to break their necks. In one of the first executions Calcraft carried out at the new Reading Gaol his victim, Thomas Jennings, took more than three minutes to die. On 31 March 1856, Calcraft executed William Bousfield, but a threat he had received that he would be shot on the scaffold unnerved him. After releasing the bolt securing the trapdoor on which the condemned man was standing, Calcraft ran off, leaving Bousfield hanging; a few moments later Bousfield raised one of his legs to support himself on the platform. Calcraft's assistant tried to push the victim off, but Bousfield repeatedly succeeded in supporting himself. The officiating chaplain forced the frightened Calcraft to return to the scaffold, where he \\"threw himself around his [Bousfield's] legs and by the force of his weight finally succeeded in strangling him\\". Calcraft's bungling became the subject of a popular ballad. Calcraft was also reportedly nervous of executing Fenians, because of threats he had received. On 22 November 1867 he officiated at the public execution of William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien, who became known as the Manchester Martyrs. The three Fenians had been found guilty of the murder of a police officer, and were hanged together. Most accounts claim that Allen died almost instantaneously from a broken neck, but Larkin and O'Brien were not so fortunate. A Catholic priest in attendance, Father Gadd, reported that: Father Gadd refused to allow Calcraft to dispatch O'Brien in the same way, and so \\"for three-quarters of an hour the good priest [Father Gadd] knelt, holding the dying man's hands within his own, reciting the prayers for the dying. Then the long drawn out agony ended.\\" Towards the end of his career the feeling began to be expressed in the press that Calcraft's age was catching up with him. On 15 November 1869, aged 69, Calcraft executed Joseph Welsh, for murder, at Maidstone Gaol. Reporting on the execution The Times commented that \\"the adjustment of the rope was slow and bungling, and such as to show that Calcraft's age has unfitted him for his occupation\\". Later life Calcraft in later years By 1869 Calcraft's mother, Sarah, was living as a pauper in a workhouse at Hatfield Peverel near Chelmsford. Calcraft was ordered to pay 3 shillings a week towards her upkeep, to which he objected, arguing that his brother and sister should be made to help, and that he had three children of his own to support, although there is no record of his marriage. After reluctantly being forced to retire from office because of old age in 1874, Calcraft received a pension of 25 shillings a week from the City of London and was succeeded as hangman by William Marwood. Although as a younger man Calcraft had been considered to be \\"genial\\", with a love of breeding rabbits, in his later years he was described as \\"surly and sinister-looking, with long hair and beard, in scruffy black attire and a fob chain\\". Calcraft died at Poole Street in Hoxton, on 13 December 1879 and is buried in Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington. An obituary published in The New York Times on 1 January 1880 reported that \\"Several so-called biographies of Calcraft were published during his lifetime, but all are notable for a narrow stream of fact meandering through a broad meadow of commentary, and not one may be considered worthy of the subject or to be relied on for a strict accuracy of statement\\". The earliest of them was an octavo pamphlet published in 1846 entitled The Groans of the Gallows; or; The Past and Present Life of William Calcraft, the Living Hangman of Newgate.

The VNQDƒê had previously attempted to engage in clandestine activities to undermine French rule, but increasing French scrutiny on their activities led to their leadership group taking the risk of staging a large scale military attack in the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam. Shortly after midnight on 10 February, about 50 Vietnamese soldiers (Tirailleurs indochinois) of the 4th Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles within the Y√™n B√°i garrison turned on their French officers with assistance from about 60 civilian VNQDƒê members who invaded the camp from the outside. The mutiny failed within 24 hours when the majority of the Vietnamese soldiers in the garrison refused to participate and remained loyal to the colonial army. Further sporadic attacks occurred across the Delta region, with little impact. French retribution to the attack was swift and decisive. The main leaders of the VNQDƒê were arrested, tried and put to death, effectively ending the military threat of what was previously the leading Vietnamese nationalist revolutionary organisation. Background and planning The VNQDƒê provided the first sustained military opposition to French rule since Phan ƒê√¨nh Ph√πng. Vietnam had gradually become a French colony between 1859 and 1883. The first phase started in 1859, when French and Spanish forces began an invasion of southern Vietnam, leading to the ceding of three southern provinces to form the colony of Cochinchina under the Treaty of Saigon in 1864. In 1867, the French seized three further provinces and by 1883, the process was complete, when northern and central Vietnam were conquered and made into the French protectorates of Tonkin and Annam and incorporated into French Indochina.Marr (1970), p. 55. Initially, military resistance to French rule came through the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng movement led by T√¥n Th·∫•t Thuy·∫øt and Phan ƒê√¨nh Ph√πng, which sought to install the boy Emperor H√†m Nghi at the head of an independent nation.Marr (1970), p. 62. However, with the death of Ph√πng in 1895, military opposition effectively ended.Marr (1970), pp. 67‚Äì68. The only other notable incidents after this came in 1917 with the Thai Nguyen rebellion. The lack of militant activity changed in the late 1920s with the formation of the VNQDƒê, or Vietnamese Nationalist Party. The party began to generate attention among French colonial authorities and was blamed for the assassination of Bazin on 9 February 1929, a French labour recruiter despised among the populace, leading to a heavy French crackdown. The French purges caused considerable detriment to the independence movement in general and the VNQDƒê in particular. Nearly 1000 VNQDƒê members were arrested; the demolition of many of the Party's facilities ensued. The VNQDƒê decided to abandon its clandestine philosophy and engage in open attacks against the French, hoping to foment a general uprising among the people. A minority felt that even though there was a danger that French crackdowns would irreparably weaken the party, they should try and bide their time and go into hiding in the mountainous Hoa Binh Province and focus on writing propaganda books and pamphlets, and take an extended period to prepare a large armed attack.Luong (2010), p. 113. It has also been alleged that Ho Chi Minh had tried to contact the VNQDD leadership to try and advise them to bide their time. Recruitment campaigns and grassroots activist drives were put in place, even though the VNQDD were realistic and understood that their assault was unlikely to succeed. The village elders were used to mobilise neighbours into the political movement. Others travelled to nearby villages and tried to recruit younger members by invoking the success of Japan in militarily defeating Russia in 1905 and Kuomintang in China.Luong (2010), p. 91. The party logic was \\"Even if victory is not achieved, we will fully mature as human beings with our [heroic] efforts\\".Luong (2010), p. 90. Since the VNQDƒê was only strong in the northern areas of Vietnam, the attacks were to be staged in the Red River Delta, and the garrison at Yen Bay was identified as a key point. The French authorities used Vietnamese soldiers and VNQDƒê members were among the garrison at Yen Bay; they engaged in cajoling their colleagues with revolutionary rhetoric.Duiker, pp. 157‚Äì162. Although armed resistance had died down since World War II, the Red River area of northern Vietnam, which included Y√™n B√°i, had been a disproportionate source of nationalist militancy since the French colonisation. However, the preparation for the planned uprising was affected by discoveries of arms caches and propaganda material. In part, this was due to a high-ranking informer, Pham Thanh Duong, who was on the VNQDD's Central Committee as the head of military affairs. A high-level planning meeting was held on 1 November 1929, and this was soon reported in full to local colonial officials and military intelligence. At this meeting, the VNQDD leader Nguy·ªÖn Th√°i H·ªçc asked for a map of the French military airfield at Bach Mai and assigned Duong the responsibility of recruiting personnel for an attack. Discussions were also held for the finalisation of plans of attack on Nam Dinh, Lang Son, Haiphong, Bac Ninh and Mong Cai, although an intended assault on the capital Hanoi was still not ready. Hoc told Duong that several hundreds of civilians would be found for the airfield attack, and that sufficient food and weaponry was available for participants. Two days later, at another meeting, the leadership discussed the importance of holding the towns to be attacked for several days so that exiled Vietnamese could arrive from China. The VNQDD leadership also discussed the need to try and widen the attacks to areas in central and southern Vietnam, and to recruit Vietnamese soldiers who were members of the colonial army. On 24 November 1929, in preparation for the attack, the VNQDD formed a provisional government in anticipation of ending French rule. This occurred in the presence of 13 provincial VNQDD leaders. Hoc was elected president, Nhu vice president, Chinh the interior minister, and Duong the military affairs minister. On 25 December 1929, the French authorities made an attempt to arrest the whole VNQDD leadership in a raid on a planning meeting at Vong La, having being tipped off by Duong. The VNQDD leaders narrowly escaped, learning of Duong's role in the process.Luong (2010), p. 34. Duong was later shot in the abdomen by VNQDD members in Hanoi in May 1930, seriously injuring him.Luong (2010), pp. 114‚Äì115. Chinh was taken by Nguyen Dac Bang to the latter's village in Son Duong to recover from injuries caused in the raid, and the village turned out to be a focal point for the preparations for the attack, serving as the de facto regional headquarters. Throughout the latter part of 1929, more VNQDD members came to Son Duong to hide and continue preparations. With the knowledge that an attack was going to take place, and due to prior disturbances, French colonial authorities took measures within the colonial forces to try and dilute the effect of any anticipated mutiny. There had been specific concerns about the fidelity of Vietnamese troops in the garrisons located at Hanoi and Nam Dinh, and plans to transfer some troops to remote areas to lower the level of Vietnamese troops in these areas had been discussed. A number of Vietnamese warrant officers, who had been charged with disciplining their Vietnamese enlisted men, had already been transferred away from larger centres, disrupting VNQDD attempts to foment an insurrection within the colonial military.Luong (2010), pp. 33‚Äì34. At a more general level, large-scale arrests in the provinces of Ki√™n An, Hai Duong, Vinh Y√™n, Bac Ninh and Bac Giang had also compromised the planned military campaigns in those localities.Luong (2010), p. 296. Despite the fact that Duong's cover had been blown, the French authorities still continued to receive some intelligence indicating that attacks were planned for northern Vietnam during the Lunar New Year period in early February. Military and civilian colonial leaders were placed on alert and efforts were made to clamp down on the propagation of any anti-colonial sentiments among Vietnamese soldiers. Having been warned of an impending attack on the town of Hung Hoa in Phu Tho Province, 50 additional soldiers were brought in on the eve of the attack, something the VNQDD was unaware of. On 28 January 1930, a final planning meeting was held in the village of Vong La in Ph√∫ Th·ªç Province. The VNQDƒê leader Nguy·ªÖn Th√°i H·ªçc declared that the situation was reaching desperation, and asserted that if the party did not act soon, they would be scattered by French police. H·ªçc built up enthusiasm for the revolt, and those who were reluctant to carry through were coerced into complying. The uprising was set for the night of 9 February and the small hours of the following day. Hoc was to command forces in the lower Red River Delta near the city of Haiphong, Nguyen Khac Nhu was assigned the upper delta around Y√™n B√°i and Pho Duc Chinh was to lead an attack on the military post at S∆°n T√¢y. Nguyen The Nghiep, who had split with the main body of the VNQDƒê, led a group who was now across the Chinese border in Yunnan province. He said that he had the support of local soldiers at the L√†o Cai garrison and would launch attacks on French border posts,Duiker, p. 162. so exiled VNQDƒê members could re-enter Vietnam and join the uprising. The uprisings were supposed to be simultaneous, but H·ªçc sent a last-minute order to Nhu to postpone action until 15 February. The messenger was arrested by the French and Nhu was unaware of the change in schedule. Yen Bay was a military post comprising more than 600 troops in four companies of infantry. These were commanded by 20 French officers and non-commissioned officers. VNQDƒê members had been espousing revolutionary sentiment in the area for several months and there was considerable tension in the town leading up to the planned mutiny. The nearby village of S∆°n D∆∞∆°ng in Ph√∫ Th·ªç was a hotbed of preparations, as many of the bombs and hand grenades used by the VNQDƒê were manufactured there. These were made from cast iron shells or cement opium containers that were then filled with gunpowder.Luong (2010), p. 93. More than 100 bombs by around 20 militants were made at the home of Nguyen Dac Bang, who also organised the drafting and printing of propaganda leaflets‚Äîfor distribution among soldiers and civilians alike‚Äîand led the recruitment of villagers in his area.Luong (2010), p. 92. Over the course of the preparations, the village administrators, who were part of the French regime, joined the movement and did not report the activities to their colonial superiors. It was there that Nhu prepared a command post to coordinate what would be the centrepiece of the attack, the assaults against Y√™n B√°i and Ph√∫ Th·ªç.Luong, p. 24. Bombs and other weapons were also manufactured in Cao Mai and Xuan Lung in the district of Lam Thao.Luong (2010), p. 94. Some VNQDƒê members, villagers from S∆°n D∆∞∆°ng and other settlements in L√¢m Thao District, both male and female, had begun to arrive in Yen Bay with weapons in their baggage. They travelled to the garrison town by train on the pretence of going on a pilgrimage to a noted temple. They carried bombs, scimitars, and insignia, which they hid under religious material, such as incense and fruit and flowers that were to be offered at the altar. The group split into three and disembarked at three different stations in order to avoid raising the suspicion of the police. They were then led to hideouts by those Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army who were in league with them. Contemporaneous French military reports and a VNQDD member suggested that there were around 200 people from Phu Tho province, but the final French report estimated 60 participants based on the fluctuation in the number of fourth-class train tickets sold for the relevant rail service. On 9 February, the evening before the attacks, back in S∆°n D∆∞∆°ng, a large contingent of rebels made their final preparations before heading into battle. They met at three points; the homes of Bang and the local Confucian scholar, and in the fields. They then joined together for a final meeting before Nhu divided the combined forces in two groups. Nhu led one towards a barracks in H∆∞ng H√≥a, while the other would attack the town facilities in the district capital of L√¢m Thao. Some members of the rebels wore khaki uniforms and they departed for their objective after midnight. Nhu was armed with the pistol, while the others were each given a scimitar and two bombs. The groups traversed rivers on boats and arrived outside their attack points, where they were to synchronised their assaults by sending a light signal.Luong, p. 25. The local French commander at Y√™n B√°i had been warned of suspicious circumstances, and although he gave them no credence, he did implement minor precautions. At nightfall, the VNQDƒê conspirators in Y√™n B√°i held a final meeting on a nearby hill. They wore red and gold silk headbands. The red stood for revolution and the gold represented the Vietnamese people. They donned red armbands with the words \\"Vietnamese Revolutionary Forces\\".Currey, p. 22. Around forty attended and some wanted to back down, but the remainder threatened to have them shot.Duiker, pp. 162‚Äì163. Attack At around 1:30 a.m. on Monday, 10 February 1930, approximately 50 indigenous soldiers belonging to the Second Battalion of the Fourth Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles (R√©giment de Tirailleurs Tonkinois), stationed at Y√™n B√°i and reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDƒê, attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers.Rettig, p. 310. The plan was for the rebels to split into three groups. One group was to infiltrate the infantry barracks, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support amongst the Vietnamese troops; a second, which was to include the external VNQDD members, was to fight its way into the post headquarters, while the third group would enter the officers' quarters.Duiker, p. 163. The longer term goal was to capture the barracks, secure the city, set up anti-aircraft guns in the hills and create a strong point around the railway station. They were to dig trenches around it to defend it from incoming colonial forces.Luong, p. 29. The Frenchmen were caught off guard and five were killed, with three seriously wounded. The mutineers managed to win over a few more tirailleurs from the 5th and 6th companies of the battalion, and raised the flag of the VNQDƒê on top of one of the buildings. They captured the armoury and proclaimed victory. The leaders of the uprising sent a patrol into the centre of the town to exhort the populace to join the insurrection, falsely claiming that they had already eliminated the entire French officer corps. In part, the authorities in Y√™n Bai did not anticipate the attack as well as they could have, due to a lack of coordination between military and civilian authorities. The garrison commander saw the base as being outside the realm of civilian administration, and the awkwardness between the military and civilian administrators was accentuated by the fact that the civilian r√©sident had previously been an officer with a lower rank than the garrison commander. However, about two hours later, it became apparent that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack.Luong, p. 30. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the M√©daille militaire for their role in the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre.Rives, p. 73. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising,Luong, p. 23. and this was also relayed by local colonial authorities in Vietnam back to the Minister of Colonies, who still maintained his belief that the communists had been responsible three decades after the event.Luong (2010), p. 295. Due to the failure of their attempt to take control of the barracks, the VNQDƒê leaders did not achieve their goal of seizing the train station. They also failed to cut the telegraph lines, allowing the colonial forces to send a message requesting air support. One reason given to explain the failure of the bulk of the garrison to support the rebels was that a local VNQDƒê leader inside the garrison, Quang Can, had fallen ill in the lead-up and was sent to a hospital in Hanoi. When he heard of the failed uprising, he committed suicide. In addition, the insurrectionists had failed to liquidate the Garde indig√®ne (native gendarmerie) post of Yen Bay town and were unable to convince the frightened civilian population to join them in a general revolt. At 07:30, a counterattack by tirailleurs of the 8th company of the battalion led by their French commander, backed by a single aircraft, scattered the mutineers; two hours later, order was re-established in Yen Bay. The flag of VNQDƒê was briefly erected atop the garrison at Yen Bay. On the same evening, the two VNQDƒê insurrectionary attempts in the S∆°n D∆∞∆°ng sector also failed. When Nhu saw the light flashing from Lam Thao, he ordered his men‚Äînumbering around 40‚Äîto enter Hung Hoa and head for the barracks, to raid the Garde indig√®ne post.Luong, p. 25. Nhu's men traversed the streets and avoided passing the French administrative offices and arrived at the military complex, shouting at the Vietnamese sentries to open the doors and join the revolt. One of the VNQDƒê militants carried a banner saying \\"Revolutionary Armed Forces: Every Sacrifice for the Liberation of the Fatherland and the Vietnamese People\\". They had banked on their countrymen joining them, but instead were met with gunfire. The VNQDƒê responded by throwing bombs over the walls and setting fire to a side door. They then forced their way in and focused their attack on the residence of the commanding officer, but he managed to escape. Three of the men penetrated the officers' compound to mount a search. The colonial forces were stronger and easily repelled the VNQDƒê group, who retreated and headed towards the river. However, their three comrades were in the compound searching for the commanding officer and did not hear the signal to retreat. Nevertheless, they were able to escape after the colonial troops had already dispersed their VNQDƒê colleagues. The French captured three other men and 17 unused bombs. It appeared that certain of the Vietnamese soldiers and Garde indig√®ne gendarmes comprising the H∆∞ng H√≥a garrison had received prior warning of the insurrection. The VNQDƒê members had done propaganda work in trying to cultivate the H∆∞ng H√≥a tirailleurs in the past and were confident of being able to sway them. Possibly wary of the loyalty of the locally recruited tirailleurs and gardes, French officials had brought in 50 troops from another area on the eve of the uprising.Luong, p. 26. Nhu then decided that his men would go to L√¢m Thao to reinforce their colleagues.Luong, p. 27. On the way, they stopped at the nearby town of Kinh Khe, where the instructor, Nguyen Quang Kinh, and one of his two wives were slain by VNQDƒê members in an apparent revenge killing. Kinh had previously been affiliated with the VNQDƒê, whose members took him away. His wife had tried to follow him, so the VNQDƒê captured her as well. French intelligence reports speculated that Kinh had been killed because he would not join his former colleagues. Nhu then led his men through L√¢m Thao. The plan was that they would help to consolidate the other unit's control on the town until the afternoon. They were hopeful that the attack in Y√™n B√°i would have been successfully completed by then, and that the mutineers and people of Y√™n B√°i would come to L√¢m Thao and stage their forces before attacking the barracks at Phu Tho. However, they were not fast enough.Luong, p. 28. Earlier in the night, the VNQDƒê group at L√¢m Thao had managed to destroy the Garde indig√®ne post in L√¢m Thao and the VNQDƒê briefly seized control of the district seat. They had disarmed the Vietnamese personnel of the Garde indig√®ne detachment in the town and the district chief fled, so the nationalists were able to burn down his quarters. A young VNQDƒê member had rallied the town's population by propounding the plans of the VNQDƒê, and the population in the surrounding areas responded by entering the town shouting nationalist slogans and offering to either volunteer to join the uprising or donate food supplies. The VNQDƒê flag was raised over the town and a proclamation of victory was read out. At sunrise, a newly arrived Garde indig√®ne unit inflicted heavy losses on the insurgent group, mortally wounding Nhu, one of the main leaders of the VNQDƒê.Rettig, p. 311. Nhu attempted to commit suicide, finally succeeding on the third attempt. Many of the rebels were captured and the remainder retreated.Luong, p. 28. Aware of what had happened in the upper delta region, Chinh abandoned plans for an attack on the S∆°n T√¢y garrison and fled, but he was captured a few days later by French authorities. The French imposed a curfew on Hanoi, the capital of northern Vietnam for 12 days. French troops were sent to S∆°n T√¢y and Phu Tho where attacks by the VNQDD had been planned, and reinforcements were sent to Tuy√™n Quang, Nam ƒê·ªãnh and H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng as well. Garrisons that consisted entirely of Vietnamese were reinforced with French soldiers. A few further violent incidents occurred until 22 February, when Governor-General of French Indochina Pierre Pasquier declared that the insurrection had been defeated. On 10 February, a policeman was injured by a VNQDƒê member at a checkpoint in Hanoi; at night, arts students pelted government buildings with bombs. The buildings were targeted because they symbolised what the students regarded as the colonial state's repressive power. On the night of 15 February and the early morning of 16 February, the nearby villages of Phu Duc in Th√°i B√¨nh Province and Vƒ©nh B·∫£o in H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng Province were seized for a few hours by the leader of the VNQDƒê, Nguy·ªÖn Th√°i H·ªçc, and his remaining forces. In the first case, the VNQDD fighters disguised themselves as colonial troops and managed to trick their opponents, before seizing the military post in the town. In the process, they wounded three guards and disarmed the post.Luong, p. 31. In the second village, the local mandarin representing the French colonial government, Tri Huyen, was murdered. After being driven out, the VNQDƒê fled to the village of Co Am. On 16 February, French warplanes responded by bombarding the settlement. It was the first time that air power had been used in Indochina. Five wooden Potez 35 biplanes dropped 60 10 kg bombs on the village and raked machine-gun fire indiscriminately, killing 200, mostly civilians. On the same day, Tonkin's Resident Superior Ren√© Robin, ordered a mopping-up operation involving two hundred Gardes indig√®nes under eight French commanders and two S√ªret√© inspectors. The insurrection was officially declared over on 22 February, after Hoc and his lieutenants, Pho Duc Chinh and Nguyen Thanh Loi, were apprehended while trying to flee into China. Robin told his officials to publicise the punitive bombing of the village in order to intimidate and dissuade other settlements from supporting the VNQDƒê. In response to the VNQDD attacks, the French engaged in punitive raids into S∆°n D∆∞∆°ng, burning down 69 homes, forcing the villages to pay extra taxes and perform corvee labour to rebuild the destroyed French property in L√¢m Thao. The villagers were then fined and forced at gunpoint to walk 16 km to Lam Thao from their village to deliver bamboo to the French authorities.Luong, pp. 31‚Äì32. In Son Duong and other villages, the large bamboo hedge enclosing the settlements were removed in an attempt to \\"shame\\" the populace, who were now \\"exposed\\" to the outside world.Luong (2010), p. 97. The troops at Y√™n B√°i initiated a security crackdown by banning local boats from travelling along the Red River and preventing the transport of merchandise by other means, resulting in 10,000 piasters of lost revenue in the space of a month. The anthropologist and historian Hy V. Luong said that although the failure of the attack was not unexpected given the imbalance in resources, he also noted that the VNQDD support base was overwhelming restricted to the educated urban class rather than the rural masses, and was thus not suited for a protracted guerrilla given that it had not cultivated the population for that purpose.Luong (2010), p. 33. French reaction Neither the mutiny nor the popular uprising came entirely as a surprise to the French authorities. The colonial government's first large scale crackdown on the VNQDD in 1929 had substantially damaged the party, which had modelled itself on the Chinese Kuomintang of Chiang Kai- shek.Tucker, p. 442. The crackdown also had the effect of increasing the violent tendencies within what remained of the VNQDƒê. Its remaining leadership was now willing to intensify preparations for a violent overthrow of colonial rule to create an independent Vietnamese republic. Most of the party's leadership ranks, but not its lower-ranking members and affiliates, seem to have concluded that they were too weak and too closely spied on by the S√ªret√© to have a meaningful chance of success. At the most optimistic, they could hope to trigger a spontaneous uprising; at the worst, the subsequent French reprisals would transform them into anti-colonial martyrs. Finally, there was disagreement or a communication problem over the timing of the insurrection: after Hoc had ordered the postponement of the mutiny, Nhu still proceeded.Rettig, p. 312. =Judicial measures= One of the first responses taken in the aftermath of Yen Bay mutiny was the \\"purification of units and the sending of those contaminated into detention or into isolated disciplinary units\\". This consisted of an internal army purge organised by military authorities, and the prosecution of civilian and military participants in the mutiny and in the VNQDƒê uprising at large by the relevant civilian authorities. The judicial action occurred through the Criminal Commission of Tonkin, created by Governor General Pasquier on 12 February, and presided over by Jules Bride. It convened five times in four different places during 1930. It prosecuted 547 individuals, soldiers and civilians alike, and handed down 80 death sentences (not all of which were enacted), 102 life sentences of forced labour, 243 deportations, 37 sentences of forced labour for 20 years, six shorter sentences of forced labour, two lifelong detentions, and one term detention for 20 years. There were 18 acquittals, and 58 accused individuals could not be prosecuted due to lack of evidence. In addition to the Criminal Commission, provincial tribunals were also involved in the legal procedures.Rettig, p. 315. The prisoners who were deported were sent to places such as the island penal colony of Poulo Condore off the coast of southern Vietnam, or to French Guiana to join other prisoners from events such at the Thai Nguyen uprising of 1917, where a prison camp was being used to clear land for economic development.Luong (2010), pp. 117‚Äì118. The largest number of death penalties were handed down by the first Criminal Commission, which had convened at Yen Bay on 27 February, just 17 days after the attacks, to try those implicated in the mutiny and nearby insurrections. The Criminal Commission was actually a military court that held proceedings in makeshift chambers in the barracks.Luong (2010), p. 102. Some of the accused military personnel defended themselves on the reasoning that they had been \\"surprised and forced to take part in the insurrection\\".Luong (2010), p. 101. The other defendants, military or civilian, accepted full responsibility for all actions, including for those of the men under their command, while some others denied any involvement.Luong (2010), pp. 101‚Äì102. Some mid-level leaders admitted to carrying out the actions in question but said that they did not constitute crimes but duties to the country or party and therefore did not constitute personal fault. Alternatively, they submitted that they were following orders and therefore not responsible.Luong (2010), pp. 102‚Äì103. In contrast, Hoc described himself as a professional revolutionary and took responsibility for the entire campaign. He presented himself as the VNQDD leader and then gave a political speech about the VNQDD's objectives and why non-violent lobbying was ineffective, before being cut off by the presiding judge. At various times, the high-ranking VNQDD members mixed anti-colonial rhetoric based on anecdotes of prior anti-Chinese and anti-French warriors, with French history and political thought regarding civil rights, which according to Luong, showed the influence of French education on the political base of the VNQDD.Luong (2010), p. 103. He cited the examples of Hoc‚Äîwho used terms such as equality and liberty repeatedly‚Äîand that of the sister of Hoc's fianc√©e, who said the colonial situation was unjust and inconsistent with the French esteem for Joan of Arc. Among the 87 people found guilty at Yen Bay, 46 were servicemen. Of those convicted, 39 were sentenced to death, five to deportation, 33 to life sentences of forced labour, nine to 20 years, and one to five years of forced labour. Among those condemned to death, 24 were civilians and 15 were servicemen.Rettig, p. 316. In a session of the Criminal Commission at Phu Tho, some defendants were sentenced to life exile in other French colonies for donating as little as 100 piasters to the cause, even though in some of these cases, the authorities admitted they could not prove the defendants were members of the VNQDD.Luong (2010), p. 109. Nguy·ªÖn Th√°i H·ªçc, leader of the VNQDƒê, was executed for his role in leading the uprising. Hoc and others in the leadership group‚Äîwith the exception of Chinh‚Äîtried to appeal their death sentences to the Council of the Protectorate, and after this failed, they sought clemency.Luong (2010), p. 104. Immediately after the large number of death sentences were handed down and while the appeals and clemency requests were being considered, there was vigorous debate over the appropriateness of the judicial measures. Those associated with the colonial regime in Vietnam strongly advocated harsh punishments and a further expansion of power, while domestic authorities in France took a more moderate stance in public due to the presence of leftist political movements. In contrast, Vietnamese public servants disagreed with the opinions of their French colonial supervisors. In March 1930, M Borel, the French delegate to the High Council of Colonies from northern Vietnam called a meeting of local officials with the intention of using it as a show of political support for granting wider powers to colonial authorities to crack down on pro-independence activities. However, this backfired, as the Vietnamese bureaucrats had already unanimously agreed beforehand at a meeting of the Tonkin Chamber of Representatives beforehand to raise the issues of the punitive bombing of Co Am and the death penalty. When the meeting occurred with Borel, they opposed a motion to increase the authority of French officials and opposed a motion to endorse the sentences handed down by the military courts, having tried to delay proceedings with time-wasting speeches. They also called for more Vietnamese participation in the colonial army, and the rescission of the blacklisting of various students from serving in government posts in future for past political agitation. Eventually the local bureaucrats walked out and the French officials voted to increase the powers of the Governor-General of Indochina, purportedly allowing him to review capital punishment cases without requiring final approval from Paris. This motion was not binding on the central government in Paris but was reported widely in the media in both France and Vietnam.Luong (2010), p. 105. In France, the severity of the sentences led to a campaign by the French Communist Party, the French Human Rights League (FHRL) and to various demonstrations by Vietnamese expatriates.Luong (2010), p. 106. At the time, more than 1,500 Vietnamese students were resident in France, particularly in Paris. On 22 May 1930, more than 1,000 demonstrated outside √âlys√©e Palace against the French reaction to Yen Bay. The police arrested 47 and eventually deported 17 back to Vietnam, where most of them engaged in communist anti-colonial activities.Marr (1981), p. 40. This occurred in defiance of a court order that deemed the government's charges against them to be unfounded, and led to combative debate in the National Assembly between the Communist and Socialist Parties on one side and the conservative majority on the other. Ph√≥ ƒê·ª©c Ch√≠nh ‚Äì one of commanders of Vietnamese Revolutionary Army (Vi·ªát-nam C√°ch-m·∫°ng Qu√¢n). Due to the high number of death sentences handed down, the Minister of Colonies intervened with Governor-General Pasquier, so that no execution could be performed unless the case had been reviewed by a pardoning commission. The presidential pardon reduced the quantity of death penalties pronounced at the first Criminal Commission at Yen Bay from 39 to 13.Luong (2010), p. 299. Pardon was refused only to those who had killed a French officer, warrant officer, or a native soldier. The civilians benefited proportionately more from this intervention, as the enlisted soldiers had been responsible for most of the killings at Yen Bay. Among the 13 who were guillotined on 17 June 1930 were the top VNQDƒê leaders, Hoc and Chinh. The condemned men cried \\"Viet Nam!\\" as they were to be executed.Hammer, p. 84. Hoc's fianc√©e committed suicide later on the same day.Luong (2010), p. 112. Hoc made a last plea to the French in the form of a letter. In it, he claimed that he had always wanted to cooperate with the authorities, but that French intransigence had forced him to revolt. He contended that if France wanted to stay in Indochina, then it would have to drop policies that he termed as brutal, and become more amiable towards Vietnamese people. He called for the introduction of universal education, training in commerce and industry and an end to the corruption of the French- installed mandarins.Duiker, p. 164. The magazine Phu Nu Tan Van (Women‚Äôs News) disseminated pictures of the condemned VNQDƒê members in one of their issues, raising the stature of the revolutionaries in death.Marr (1981), p. 223. The punitive bombing of Co Am also led to criticism of the French government. The central government in Paris defended the actions of their officials in Vietnam, citing prior instances in 1912, 1917 and 1920 when airstrikes were used to suppress anti-colonial revolts while minimising regime casualties. Resident Superior Robin strongly defended his policy of airstrikes, saying that as it was well known that the populace was hostile to French authority, it was pointless to risk French casualties, which he felt would embolden nationalist morale.Luong (2010), pp. 106‚Äì107. He said: The FHRL also raised the issue of the punitive house-burning in Son Duong, corresponding with the Ministry of Colonies regarding the legality of the property damage. The FHRL claimed that the burning of dwellings was punishable by death under both Vietnamese and French law. In 1932, the Ministry of Colonies responded and said that the burnings were done with the approval of village elders. The response followed a similar line of deterrence reasoning to the justification for the airstrikes on Co Am. It said \\"Any other method would have been considered a sign of weakness ... it would have led us not to the destruction of a few thatch houses, but to the use of arms and the sacrifice of a much larger number of people under our protection who might have been drawn into that movement\\". There were also penalties enacted against the French officers whose neglectful behaviour had contributed to the mutiny at Yen Bay. Resident Superior Robin released Resident Massimi from his duties immediately after the mutiny. No punishment was handed down to Commandant Le Tacon, the main person responsible for the security at Yen Bay which had failed to stop the mutiny. Neither Robin nor General Aubert, who were ultimately accountable for the failures of their subordinates, were punished. The former remained in Indochina as Governor General until retiring in 1936. Aubert returned to France when his three-year term ended in the autumn of 1930.Rettig, p. 317. General Commandant Superior Aubert, who had been so lenient towards Le Tacon, organised an internal army purge in parallel with the trials of the Criminal Commissions. Its objectives were to reassert control over the native armed forces in Tonkin by identifying, penalising, isolating, and re-educating disloyal troops, thereby setting an example to the others. According to Patrice Morlat, \\"545 tirailleurs and warrant officers were the object of sanctions: 164 were transferred into disciplinary companies in Tonkin, 94 to Africa..., 57 were handed over to the civilian jurisdiction, and 160 were reduced to the ranks and put on leave without pay.\\" Such remedial actions demonstrated the level of infiltration of the army, and clearly showed that the predominant culpability for the mutiny was seen to be placed squarely on the Vietnamese. In contrast with the first phase of suppression of the VNQDD in 1929, when 121 soldiers suspected of having VNQDƒê membership were punished and 40 put under investigation by the S√ªret√©, the measures taken after Yen Bay were far more extensive and harsh. More than 500 out of Tonkin's 12,000 indigenous soldiers, a percentage of 4.5%, were punished by the military, demonstrating the extent to which Vietnamese soldiers in the north were seen to be involved in activities contrary to their military duty. At a more general social level, French authorities took a more stringent line towards any activities that could be considered pro-independence. The writing of pro- VNQDD songs were met with detention orders, and many village-level associations were banned due to fears they could be used for political organising.Luong (2010), p. 118. Many villages heavily affected by the mutiny and the subsequent crackdown saw a sudden increase in conversions to Catholicism, as many hoped that French priests would lobby the authorities for the sentences imposed on their friends and relatives to be reduced. Over the following decade, the proportion of Catholics in Phu Tho Province rose to 14%. In 1936, the leftist Popular Front came to power, resulting in a wave of sentence reductions, albeit with parole conditions that forced them to stay in their villages and periodically report to local authorities. There was also an increase in attempts to deter nationalist activists by attempting to give them low-level jobs in the administration, but this policy was not very successful.Luong (2010), pp. 119‚Äì120. Impact on colonial rule The impact of the mutiny on French rule was minimal, in the short and long term. The military casualties inflicted on the French army in the attack were in single figures and the attack did not generate widespread awareness among the populace, as the intended popular uprising did not occur. Instead, the attack backfired and saw a large number of VNQDƒê members killed, captured or executed. The subsequent French military and civilian crackdown saw military security increase and the VNQDƒê's ability to threaten French authority in Vietnam was extinguished. The vast majority of the leadership were killed or sentenced to death, and the remnants of the VNQDƒê fled to China, where several factions emerged under disparate leadership.Duiker, pp. 161‚Äì165. In the long run, Y√™n B√°i allowed the Indochinese Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh to inherit the VNQDƒê's status as the leading anti-colonial revolutionary movement. After the Second World War, an opportunity to fight for Vietnamese independence arose, and this allowed the communists in the Viet Minh to dictate the platform of the independence movement. As a result, the communists were able to position themselves to become the dominant force in Vietnam post- independence.Duiker, pp. 272‚Äì273. Military reforms precipitated by the mutiny The mutiny refocused attention on the long term tension over the use of Indochinese soldiers, and on the ways in which it could be resolved. The tension could be traced back to the creation of French Indochina. Cochinchina, the European term for southern Vietnam, had been colonised in 1867 and the remaining parts of Vietnam, Tonkin and Annam, the northern and central regions were conquered in 1883. Nominally, only Cochinchina was a colony, while Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia and Laos were protectorates which together comprised French Indochina. The problem centred around the French reliance on native soldiers to maintain colonial control. This need was problematic because Indo- Chinese soldiers were both enforcers of colonial order and colonial subjects. This created constant French concerns about their loyalty. Despite several attempts to deal with the issue, the basic tension between the need for and suspicion of native troops could never be entirely resolved. The need for forces to pacify the countryside was too pressing to do without them. As a result, the tension resurfaced at regular intervals, either due to proposals to improve the position of Indochinese soldiers in the army, or after a mutiny had raised question marks about the loyalty of the soldiers. =Background of Vietnamese troops in the French colonial army= The demand for Indochinese soldiers, auxiliaries first, and then regular troops, had been present since the beginning of French conquest. French troops were never numerically sufficient to assert control of the populace and then maintain Pax Gallica in the colony, thus requiring local reinforcements. French troops were too expensive compared to the substantially cheaper native troops. A lack of manpower back in Europe caused by other imperial programs and heavy casualties in World War I on the Western Front further caused a need for the recruitment of Indochinese troops. Because French Indochina was a domination and exploitation colony rather than a settler colony, there were insufficient local Frenchmen to build a settler-army. Native troops generally knew local conditions better, and could be used in terrain on which foreign troops were disadvantaged. Particularly after 1915, French Indochina was expected to financially contribute to the defence of the colony and even to send native troops to France.Rettig, p. 313. The indigenous soldiers fulfilled a number of different purposes. Initially they were collaborators in the conquest of Indochina, helping to defeat the forces of the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty and then in its pacification. After the pacification campaign was officially completed in 1897, the two main functions of the colonial army were the maintenance of internal peace and external security. Both these tasks were fulfilled in conjunction with other armed institutions, such as the Garde indig√®ne (later indochinoise), the gendarmerie, the police, and the irregular partisans in the border regions. The Garde indig√®ne, a paramilitary force, was primarily responsible for dealing with disturbances of the peace and thus played an important role in the repression of public demonstrations and popular unrest. The participation of native soldiers in the colonial forces was used as political symbolism, proof that the Union's five territories were rightfully under French tutelage. This was the \\"blood toll\\" to be paid for the Pax Gallica. In their position as colonisers and colonial subjects, the native colonial troops were also buffers between the French and the unarmed populace. Their presence demonstrated French control and power to the ordinary population, deterring those who intended to violently overthrow French rule.Rettig, p. 314. The dilemma was that the French needed local soldiers to maintain their authority, but could not rely on them too deeply because of an innate fear that they would rebel or desert. This concern was deeply institutionalized in the army in the form of \\"safe\\" ratios of \\"white\\" and \\"yellow\\" soldiers, the segregation of the army, and barriers excluding Vietnamese from becoming officers until 1929. The mutiny triggered the long existing fears about the loyalty of native soldiers, as well as many traditional French responses. =Transfer of soldiers= Soldiers in Tonkin (areas coloured red, orange and yellow), were transferred after the uprising. In addition to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to lower the risk of another insurrection. According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were moved, a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, and the extent to which they were willing to go to make future Y√™n B√°is impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDƒê cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.Rettig, p. 318. Aside from measures in Vietnam, 2,000 Indochinese soldiers returning from service in France were sent on indefinite leave and were not replaced with new recruits from Vietnam. The reason is put down by historians to be due to the fact that military discipline in France was less regimented than in Indochina and other colonial garrisons. In colonial units, the colonial military and social order with Frenchmen above their colonised troops was more easily reproduced. Metropolitan officers also treated their Vietnamese subordinates on a more equitable basis, making the Vietnamese less likely to accept the discrimination upon return to Vietnam. Overseas Vietnamese soldiers could become so alienated with their experiences that they became soft targets for communist propaganda. Upon returning home, they attempted to indoctrinate other troops with their Marxist doctrine. This train of thought further reinforced French perception that subversive ideas came from the outside rather than domestically: of the 57 soldiers involved in the mutiny, 17 had served abroad. On the other hand, according to the Thiry report, the proportion of soldiers with foreign service at Y√™n B√°i did not exceed that in other garrisons, so this was not abnormal.Rettig, p. 319. =Military intelligence reforms= In addition to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations and reducing the number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the military intelligence service. This was to be achieved by strengthening military intelligence through closer coordination with the S√ªret√©, and by raising internal standards.Rettig, p. 320. An inquiry into the mutiny at showed that cooperation between Resident Massimi and Commandant Le Tacon did not exist despite multiple requests, and that it was partly responsible for the uprising. The relationship between the civilian and military authorities were traditionally poor, but Y√™n B√°i stood out in the total lack of military-civilian cooperation. Further VNQDƒê conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as Ki·∫øn An, were detected and scotched at late notice. It was decided that the teamwork with the S√ªret√© had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Y√™n B√°i style rebellions. The rebellion allowed the civilian authorities an opportunity to involve themselves in military matters.Rettig, pp. 320‚Äì321. The S√ªret√©'s indirect penetration of military affairs involved linking the military intelligence service (SRM) to the S√ªret√© and the information provided by it, thereby making itself dependent on the political information and even political judgement and agenda of the civilian authorities. The central SRM then relayed this information to its local branches as part of its SRM Bulletin. As a result of the uprising, the SRM became more closely linked to the S√ªret√© and its methodology and philosophy in of analysing Vietnamese anti- colonial activity. It was further resolved to have all officers involved in studying revolutionary parties. The focus widened from observing only internal army activities to include developments among Vietnamese anti-colonial organisations at large.Rettig, p. 322. General Aubert cited complacency and laziness as a factor in the ineffectiveness of the officers in implement French intelligence strategy. He further asserted that the flow of intelligence between French officers and Vietnamese warrant officers was not as smooth as desired. He felt that his men were often not tactful and discreet enough; citing a lack of language skills or interest in talking to their Vietnamese colleagues in an attempt to extricate information. Aubert also believed that the Vietnamese troops were effective in hiding their anti- colonial sentiments from their French colleagues.Rettig, p. 323. In addition to the measures intended to help identify, isolate or eliminate soldiers of suspect loyalty, the regulations for dismissal were liberalised. A decree of 8 April 1930 permitted the General Commandant Superior \\"to discharge those soldiers who had been the object of convictions in excess of three months imprisonment by a military tribunal, or who would have rendered themselves guilty of activities contrary to military duty\\".Rettig, pp. 319‚Äì320. =Vietnamese language skills of French officers= Aubert's notice stressed the importance of close contact between French officers and their Vietnamese warrant officers in order to improve the quality of intelligence, but did not discuss whether this also required French officers to improve their Vietnamese language skills. The annual report of 1930 considered the language barrier was a problem. The report mentioned creating a Vietnamese studies centre in France to increase the proportion of Vietnamese-speaking French officers to enhance direct communication with their Vietnamese subordinates. However, the report principally had in mind the use of language skills as a tool of command to reinforce hierarchical relationships.Rettig, pp. 323‚Äì324. The report also considered using specialised Vietnamese language skills as a means of gathering intelligence and to control the minds of Vietnamese troops, but discarded it, citing that infiltration and clandestine anti-colonial techniques were rendering them irrelevant. The report thus concluded that deeper specialisation would not improve intelligence, and that a degree of expertise ‚Äì to improve command skills ‚Äì was all that one would need.Rettig, p. 324. The report further argued that excessive specialization would be counterproductive and thus detrimental because it required long tours in Indochina, which was deemed to be detrimental to the health of the specialist. It also aired suspicions that specialists became too trusting towards their Vietnamese subordinates, to the extent of becoming indigenophiles. Finally, specialisation was said to be detrimental because it would not only make Vietnamese troops more secretive, but would very likely improve their organisational abilities, since they would need to \\"take even more precautions\\". =Decrease in the proportion of Vietnamese troops= The French reaction to the mutiny included military punishments, new regulations, SRM institutional reform, reductions in the numbers of Vietnamese serving or working in France and increased specialisation amongst the units making up the garrison of Indochina. While these were wide-ranging changes, the military and civilian authorities did not judge them sufficient for the reassertion of control over their colonial troops. A further four decisions were implemented, aimed at establishing a stable racial balance amongst the troops in French Indochina. The number of ethnic Vietnamese soldiers was perceived as being too great. A change in recruitment and retention numbers was introduced, aimed at altering the overall ratios of troops in Indochina to a roughly equivalent proportion of one ethnic Vietnamese to each European regular or indigenous ethnic minority (Montagnards) soldier.Rettig, p. 325. The first of the four measures aimed at increasing the dependability of Vietnamese soldiers was intended to revise the ethnic proportions of the troops making up each garrison. The lack of European troops at Y√™n B√°i had been cited as a factor in the mutiny (although it had been suppressed by Vietnamese tirailleurs who remained loyal to their French officers). The decision reversed a major reorganisation of the army that had been initiated by General Aubert in 1928.Rettig, p. 326. The authorities considered replacing Vietnamese soldiers with troops from North Africa, where France had its largest colonial possessions. The most sweeping proposal was that made by Resident Superior Robin who wanted to \\"completely and radically abolish all regiments of Tirailleurs tonkinois (Vietnamese infantry) serving in the delta and the middle regions\\" and replace them with \\"white [Foreign] Legion or even North African battalions\\". This proposal was rejected by General Aubert, and eventually Governor General Pasquier adopted a compromise arrangement, which saw the disbandment of one regiment of Tirailleurs Tonkinois.Rettig, pp. 326‚Äì327. Policy strategists calculated that this reduction in Vietnamese troops could be made up by a concomitant increase in the number of European and ethnic minority troops.Rettig, p. 327. The third decision involved the \\"[r]einforcement of the occupation corps by three white battalions: one Foreign Legion battalion, [and] two Colonial Infantry battalions\\". Since it was decided that the overall number of troops in Indochina could not be reduced for external defence reasons, this necessitated the replacement of at least the two disbanded Vietnamese battalions.Rettig, pp. 327‚Äì328. Prior to the mutiny, the Department of War in Paris had clearly indicated that it would not be able \\"to provide for one more European battalion in Indochina under the 1931 Budget\\" due to fiscal constraints, manpower shortages and organisational problems. The unrest generated by the Y√™n B√°i mutiny motivated the political will to send more European (French and Foreign Legion) troops to French Indochina. Aside from replacing two Vietnamese battalions with three European battalions, the French authorities also increased the number of ethnic minority soldiers serving in the locally recruited colonial regiments. As such, the \\"[i]ntensification of recruitment of non-Annamite indigenous people: Thos, Laotians, Mois, Cambodians was decided.\\" The aim was to increase the non-Vietnamese percentage to 50% of the total of locally recruited troops.Rettig, p. 328.

It has been cut from the adjacent district Gonda in 1997. Located on the banks of the West Rapti River. Balrampur is known for the temple of Pateshwari Devi, a Shakti Pitha, and for the ruins of the nearby ancient city of Sravasti, now a pilgrimage site for Buddhists and Jains. The nearest airport is Shravasti airport from the town but it is not an international and regular airport; the nearest international and regular airport is Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow, away. Lucknow is the capital city of Uttar Pradesh and is from Balrampur district headquarters. Administration The creation of Balrampur was done by G.D.No. 1428/1-5/97/172/85-R-5 Lucknow dated 25 May 1997 by the division of District Gonda. Siddharth Nagar, Shrawasti, Gonda District, are situated in the east-west and south sides respectively and Nepal State are Situated in its northern side. The area of the district is 336917 Hectares. In which the agriculture irrigated area is 221432 Hectares. In the north of the district is situated the Shivalics ranges of the Himalayas which is called Tarai Region. According to Government of India, the district Balrampur is one of the Minority Concentrated District in India on the basis of the 2001 census data on population, socio-economic indicators and basic amenities indicators. Etymology The district is named after the erstwhile princely estate (Taluqdari) and its capital, Balrampur. The name of this estate was derived from its founder Balram Das, who founded it in c. 1600 CE. History The territory which the present Balrampur covers was a part of the ancient Kosala kingdom. =Ancient period= Sravasti was the capital of Uttara (North) Kosala. The ruins of Sahet, ancient Sravasti, spread an area of . Towards the Rapti River, a little north of Sahet, lies the ancient city of Mahet. Gautam Buddha spent 21 rainy season under the sacred Peepal tree. The famous incident of Angulimal happened in the forest of Sravasti, where the dacoit who used to kill people and wear a garland of their fingers, was enlightened by Gautam Buddha. =Medieval period= The area covered by the district was a part of Bahraich Sarkar of Awadh Subah during the Mughal rule. Later, it came under the control of the ruler of Awadh till its annexation in February, 1856 by the British government. British government separated Balrampur from Bahraich and it became a part of Gonda. =British and the post-independence period= During the British rule a commissionary was made for the administration of this area with its headquarters at Gonda and military command at Sakraura Colonelganj. During this period Balrampur was an Estate (Taluqdari) in Utraula tehsil of Gonda district, which consisted 3 tehsils, Gonda Sadar, Tarabganj and Utraula. After independence, Balrampur estate was merged with Utraula tehsil of Gonda district. On 1 July 1953 the tehsil of Utraula was bifurcated into two tehsils, Balrampur and Utraula. In 1987 three new tehsils were created from Gonda Sadar tehsil, namely, Tulsipur, Mankapur and Colonelganj. Later, in 1997 Gonda district was bifurcated into two parts and a new district, Balrampur was born consisting of three tehsils of the northern part of the erstwhile Gonda district, Balrampur, Utraula, and Tulsipur. Geography The district's northern border with Nepal's Dang Deukhuri District follows the southern edge of the Dudhwa Range of the Siwaliks. To the northeast lies Kapilvastu District, Nepal. The rest of Balrampur is surrounded by Uttar Pradesh: on the east by Siddarthnagar, Basti on the south, Gonda on the southwest, and Shravasti on the west. Balrampur's area is 3,457 km2. Economy Balrampur village is known for Balrampur Chini Mills, one of the largest sugar manufacturing industry in the country. In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Balrampur one of the country's 250 most backward villages (out of a total of 640). It is one of the 34 districts in Uttar Pradesh currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF). The district comprises 3 tehsils, Balrampur, Tulsipur and Utraula, which are further divided into 9 blocks: Balrampur, Gaindas bujurg, Gainsari, Harya satgharwa, Pachpedwa, Rehera bazar, Shriduttganj, Tulsipur and Utraula Sadullaah Nagar Demographics According to the 2011 census Balrampur village has a population of 21, 865.

It is funded by Wiltshire Council and Swindon Borough Council. It has purpose-built archive storage and research facilities and incorporates the local studies library, museums service, archaeology service, Wiltshire buildings record and the conservation service. These services were formerly housed in separate locations in Trowbridge and Salisbury and are now together under one roof. The centre opened to the public on 31 October 2007 and is being marketed as a \\"passport to the past\\" for those interested in Wiltshire and Swindon history. History Existing accommodation for the Wiltshire and Swindon Record Office, in a former mattress factory in Trowbridge, had been declared sub- standard by the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts in 1998. Wiltshire County Council and Swindon Borough Council took the opportunity not only to build a new record repository which would meet the British Standard for Archive Repositories (BS5454), but also to create a centre for Wiltshire and Swindon history. The centre preserves the collections of the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives Service, County Local Studies Library, Wiltshire Archaeological Service, Wiltshire Conservation and Museum Services and the Wiltshire Buildings Record. These services were previously at Trowbridge and Salisbury. The previous poor accommodation for the services had disadvantaged users and restricted use of services. The new facility was designed to substantially improve access, both for visitors to the centre and those using services at a distance. An education room has been included for use by schools and colleges and for training as well as a workshop to produce displays. After two unsuccessful bids to the Heritage Lottery Fund, Wiltshire County Council and Swindon Borough Council decided in spring 2004 to bear the whole cost themselves. In March 2005, Cowlins of Bristol were selected as the Design and Build contractors. This was announced at the WCC Cabinet on 18 March; that meeting also confirmed that the name of the new facility was to be \\"The Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre\\". Cowlins started work on 28 June and the roof was topped out on 6 December 2005. The building is a concrete and glass construction, covering 4,000 square metres on two floors (approximately the same area as five football pitches). It conforms to BS 5454 and has been praised as a \\"state of the art\\" building by Nicholas Kingsley, Head of the National Advisory Service, The National Archives. The building was completed in October 2006 and handed over to both Councils on 29 January 2007. After eighteen months of planning, each service moved from their existing location to the new centre in Chippenham between February and October 2007. In the case of the archive service, this involved moving over 30,000 boxes of archival material. Archaeology service The Wiltshire Archaeological Service was established in 1975 with the appointment of a County Archaeologist. It was based in Chapman‚Äôs Building, Trowbridge. Initially, the role of the Service was to carry out excavations on development sites in Wiltshire. In the late 1970s it became apparent that there was demand for information on archaeology in the form of enquiries from planners, highways engineers and developers and a decision was made to establish the Sites and Monuments Record (SMR). Complete coverage of the County was achieved in 1981. The recording and giving of advice is currently the primary role of the Service and excavations are now principally carried out by other agencies. As discoveries occur the record has grown at about 5% per annum. Advice has been supplied to County and District Planning Officers since 1980, and in 1984 links were formed with the Ministry of Defence as a result of its substantial holdings in Wiltshire. The service has benefited substantially from English Heritage grant aid, particularly in developing databases for the Avebury and Stonehenge World Heritage Sites. Archive service The Wiltshire and Swindon Archives Service cares for and gives access to the archival heritage of the County and Borough. It was established in 1947 and now holds over seven miles of archives, representing over 3,000 organisations and millions of individuals and their history, stretching back to Norman times. Initially based in County Hall it transferred to Chapman‚Äôs Building, Bythesea Road, Trowbridge, in the 1970s. That building was confirmed sub-standard by the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts in 1998. The service was called the Wiltshire Record Office until 1997 and thereafter the Wiltshire and Swindon Record Office, but in 2006 the broader title of Wiltshire and Swindon Archives was adopted. The aim of the Archives Service is to collect, preserve and give access to the historic archives of the County and Borough. The archives of the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives Service fall into three categories: official, ecclesiastical and private. Over 3,000 organisations are represented in the archive. For an area that until comparatively recently had a small and largely agricultural population, the quantity of surviving records (over 850 cubic metres) is impressive. There are five groups of archives in the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives Service that are of pre-eminent, regional or national importance: the political papers of Walter Long MP, 1854‚Äì1924; the British Rail Western Region, (formerly Great Western Railway), archives which are still growing; the archives of the West Wiltshire firms of cloth manufacturers; the Diocesan probate collection (also known as the Wiltshire Wills collection); and a collection of archive films and videos. Wiltshire Buildings Record The Wiltshire Buildings Record was set up in 1979 to fill a perceived gap, not provided for by any other Wiltshire organisations, in recording threatened buildings within the county. The Wiltshire Buildings Record has ties with other specialised bodies, including representatives from archaeology, museums, local history, archives, planning and architecture. Much of the record consists of photographic items that merit controlled storage. It was previously based in Chapman‚Äôs Building which had no such facilities. It keeps the record of statutory listed buildings within the County and provides access to the listing. Wiltshire Buildings Record has created a database of more than 13,000 sites throughout the County, thus preserving information on buildings which have since been lost, and helping to protect those which have come under threat. It creates and maintains an index of dateable building features and building types, which provides information for architectural research. It has a collection of 118 items from buildings within the county, to ensure their preservation for future study and comparison. Conservation service The Wiltshire County Council Object Conservation Service was based at Wyndham House in Salisbury from 1980 to 2007, and the Archive Conservation Service was located in Chapman's building, Trowbridge. The service was set up to provide conservation services to museums in Wiltshire as none of the museums had in-house conservation provision, also to ensure the preservation of the County Archive. It works closely with the Wiltshire County Council Museums Advisory Service. Conservation services are presently supplied to 18 museums in Wiltshire registered under the Museum Accreditation Scheme operated by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council. The service provides specialist advice on all aspects of collections care, remedial conservation and training courses. The service to Wiltshire museums is funded principally by Wiltshire Council. Income is generated by selling conservation expertise to a wide range of heritage organisations including Swindon Borough Council and other services throughout the UK. The work programme is set annually in liaison with Wiltshire museums and other heritage organisations. The South West Museums Council assisted with the establishment of this service and very close liaison and project grant funding continues with its successor body, Museums, Libraries and Archives South West. The aim of the Conservation Service is to enable Wiltshire museums to ensure the long term preservation of their collections and to ensure the preservation of the county archives. Local Studies Library ‚Äì Wiltshire Studies The Wiltshire County Council County Local Studies Library was formerly part of the Wiltshire County Council Library Service and was based in Chapman‚Äôs Building, Trowbridge. In 2007 the Local Studies Library was transferred to Heritage Services. It is a major resource for the study of Wiltshire‚Äôs heritage. The service provides advice to local history societies, research groups and individuals on both research and publication. The service acquires and gives access to the County Historic Photograph Collection, in liaison with the Wiltshire Museum Service. The aim of the Service is to acquire, preserve and give access to publications related to Wiltshire. The collection of published Wiltshire material includes 18,000 monographs, 2,600 reels of microfilm including newspapers dating from 1736, 35,000 microfiches, over 40,000 photographs and 11,000 journals. The library collects, preserves and makes available for research all Wiltshire publications, including videos, CDs, tapes and CD-ROMS. Material on adjacent counties and extensive collections on archaeology, museology, family history, architecture and history are used by heritage officers as well as being used by the public. Victoria County History The Wiltshire Victoria County History has its offices at the History Centre. It is part of the national Victoria County History. Museums service Wiltshire County Council does not directly run any museums, instead it takes an enabling approach through the County Museums Advisory Service. The service was established following the 1974 local government re-organisation. It was based in Chapman‚Äôs Building, Trowbridge. Support is focused on museums, which have, or are applying for, acceptance under the Museum Accreditation Scheme. It works closely with Wiltshire County Council Conservation Service. Following a review of the service in 1996/7, the key areas of service delivery are: *Provide a county wide publicity and promotion facility for museums *Act as professional curatorial advisers to ten small independent volunteer run museums *Provide learning, development and training opportunities for museum staff and volunteers *Advise on documentation and cataloguing standards *Provide a central repository for museum data *Provision of grant aid to supported museums *Help museums meet and maintain Museum Accreditation Scheme standards *Help museums design displays *Help museums realise the learning potential of their collections *Co-ordinate county wide projects such as volunteer recruitment *Host the Wiltshire Treasures public online catalogue Access to services Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre is open to the public. Appointments are not compulsory but the staff can be informed in advance of a visit to make the most of the time available for research. The Centre operates a computerised user registration system, so a form of identification including name and address is required. The Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre is fully accessible to visitors with disabilities. The public areas are on ground level. Disabled parking and toilet facilities are provided. The centre is equipped with a hearing loop.

It began 25 million years ago along the Alpine Fault. In this orogeny, the Southern Alps are being formed because the Pacific Plate is colliding with the Australian Plate, with a predominant oblique dextral motion, but a minor component of thrust faulting. As the plates collide, the crust thickens, with deformation and associated uplift due to isostacy occurring primarily within the Pacific Plate. Uplift From 25 to 15 million years ago most of New Zealand was still covered by ocean. Almost all the land that broke the surface of the sea was Torlesse Greywacke. Then the plates started to collide, the crust of New Zealand came under pressure and the Alpine Fault was formed. Then from 15 million to 5 million years ago the Pacific Plate was rammed up over the Australian Plate along the newly created Alpine Fault. The pressure applied from 25 to 15 million years ago had simply been too much and the crust thickened. This gave birth to the first of the Southern Alps. Also during this period of time, chlorite-grade schist was brought to the surface. From 5 million years ago to the present day the rate of uplift has accelerated. Oligoclase and biotite schist have also been pushed to the surface of the Earth. In total about 20 kilometres of uplift has taken place during the Kaikoura Orogeny but most of this has been eroded away. References * The Rise and Fall of the Southern Alps, G.

Organized in 1824 as The Franklin Society,Mitchell, Martha. (1993). \\"Franklin Society.\\" Encyclopedia Brunoniana. it was created in a year when such a large class entered Brown University that the two existing literary debating societies, the Philermenian Society and the United Brothers Society could not accommodate the new students.Mitchell, Martha. (1993). \\"Fraternities.\\" Encyclopedia Brunoniana. Notable personages such as Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, and Henry Clay accepted honorary membership into the society during this time. The society was founded with the motto: Scientia Potentia Est, meaning ‚ÄúKnowledge is Power.‚Äù Martha Mitchell's research in the Encyclopedia Brunoniana indicated that the society was dissolved some time in the 1840s. However, there is at least one reference that seems to indicate it is possible the society existed at least until the late 19th century: \\"It is believed to have been the first society organization in this city to institute a course of popular lectures for the public entertainment and instruction. Through its lectures it has introduced to the citizens some of the most noted scientists of the world.\\" Stockwell, Thomas B. (1876). \\"A History of Public Education in Rhode Island: From 1636 to 1876.\\" In recent years it has become evident that instead of being fully dissolved, the society instead changed its name to Societas Domi Pacifica and became even more secretive. It exists today under this name, and continues to tap an unknown, though assumed to be 15, number of seniors to join the society each year. The motto that they adopted after their change is \\"Videte igitur ut probe integreque in emolumentum Dei et Republicae et Universitatis.\\" This translates into, \\"see, and consequently, you will conduct yourself properly and irreproachably into the benefits of God, the Republic, and the University.\\" History The Franklin Society Coat of Arms Records indicate that ten years after its establishment, in 1834, a select core of students in the Franklin Society recognized that the quality of members had diminished due to competition with the other two literary societies and the new emergence and popularity of Fraternities. Recognizing a loss of general integrity within the Society, the Franklin Society was dissolved, its library of several hundred volumes was turned over to the College Library, and in 1847 its members were elected in equal proportions into the two older societies. Save a few references in the 19th century, the Franklin Society's presence and impact on the campus is unknown and undocumented. =Continued evidence of activity= The small bit that is known seems to indicate that the Franklin Society was originally \\"devoted especially to the study of natural science and the mechanic arts,\\" Rhees, William Jones. (1859). Manual of public libraries, institutions and societies in the United States and British provinces of North America. Further, that in 1887, the Franklin Society commissioned a \\"Report of the Committee on the geology of Rhode Island.\\" The Franklin Society. (1883). Report of the Committee on the geology of Rhode Island. These references seem to indicate a continued presence of the society beyond 1834, when it was believed to have been dissolved. =Modern activity= Further evidence of the continued existence of the Franklin Society has emerged on Brown's campus with the activities of Societas Domi Pacificae, known as Pacifica House or SDP for short. Pacifica House claims to have been founded in 1824, and that it is directly related to the Franklin Society. While little is known of their operations today, they maintain a website containing their seal and their motto: \\"Videte igitur ut probe integreque in emolumentum Dei et Republicae et Universitatis.\\" This translates to, \\"see, and consequently, you will conduct yourself properly and irreproachably into the benefits of God, the Republic, and the University.\\" Membership Membership in the society is completely secretive. No one knows either the number of students selected or the names of these students. However, it is believed that the society taps 15 seniors to join the society each year. Coat of arms The Franklin Society coat of arms consisted of three golden key intersecting each other, with the Brown crest in the background. The Brown crest serves as a tribute to the University, while the three keys are distinctly Franklin symbols. The three keys, partially references to Benjamin Franklin's electricity experiment involving a key and a kite, are said to represent Science, Reason and Action. It is not possible that this is the same seal that was used when the society was founded, as the Brown University seal was that of the College of Rhode Island until 1844.Mitchell, Martha., (1993). \\"Seal.\\" Encyclopedia Brunoniana.M However, it is possible that this seal was used from that point onward.

Through the 1930s and after the Second World War, the International Phytogeographic Excursions continued at regular intervals, but now outside the mainstream of ecology. At the same time, scientific exchange between plant ecologists had found other means. The Fifth International Phytogeographic Excursion was held in Czechoslovakia in 1928.

This species was once widely grown in Europe for its leaves, which were used like spinach, and its parsnip-like root, which was used like a radish. The Brothers Grimm's tale Rapunzel took its name from this plant. Etymology The genus Latin name (\\"campanula\\"), meaning small bell, refers to the bell-shape of the flower, while the specific name (\\"rapunculus\\") is a diminutive of the Latin \\"rapa\\" (turnip) and means 'little turnip', which refers to the shape of the root. Description Close-up on flower of Campanula rapunculus This biennial herbaceous plant reaches on average of height, with a maximum of . The stem is erect, lightly hairy, branched on the top. The basal leaves are petiolated, ovate, slightly toothed and arranged in a rosette, while the upper leaves are sessile and narrow lanceolate. The hermaphrodite flowers are clustered in a racemose inflorescence, with a bell- shaped, light blue or violet corolla, about two centimeters long. They are arranged along the stem in a fairly narrow one-sided facing cluster. The flowering period extends from May through September. The fruit is a dehiscent capsule in the form of inverted cone with many seeds. The thick root looks like a small turnip and it is edible. Distribution Campanula rapunculus is present in western Asia, northern Africa and in most of Europe, except Iceland, Ireland and Norway. It has been introduced in Denmark, southern Sweden and Great Britain. This species was once widely grown in Europe for its leaves, which were used like spinach, and its parsnip-like root, which was used like a radish. Habitat This species prefers limestone soils and grows in dry meadows, cultivated beds, forests of oaks and pine trees, along roadsides and lane, at an altitude of above sea level.

The school had an enrolment of 773 in 2017.The Irish Times - Feeder Schools - Manor House School, as retrieved 27 Feb 2018 Location Manor House occupies a complex of red-brick buildings on the road from North Bull Island to Raheny village centre, formerly the site of a \\"big house,\\" which was demolished in the early days of the school. The school site is bounded by the Santry River and Watermill Road. History The Catholic Parish of Raheny asked religious order the Poor Servants of the Mother of God to open a convent and schools in 1952, and the order, having agreed, bought Manor House in March 1952. The first element, a girls' primary school (National School (Ireland)), opened in 1953, and a fee-charging secondary school began with the new school year in 1956. Although the economy was on the rise, many parents could not afford the bi-annual payment. The secondary school grew, and the school part of the complex of buildings was extended in 1964 and 1977. By contrast, the primary school was closed. In 1967, Manor House joined the free education scheme. The Poor Servants of the Mother of God reduced their role in recent decades, and created a Board of Management in 1989, on which their appointees held four out of eight seats, with the school principal attending as Board secretary but not voting, and appointed the first lay principal in 1995. In 2007, the school sold the most remote field of its sports grounds, and this has been developed with apartments. In 2009 the school was transferred to the Le Ch√©ile Schools Trust. Governance The Le Cheile Trust, set up by a range of religious orders to oversee and act as trustee for their former schools, continues to operate with the order's ethos. The Board of Management is formally appointed by the Trust and operates within the framework set by the Trust. Several members are directly chosen by the Trust, others are nominated by parents and teachers, and the Principal is a non-voting attendee at Board meetings. Reputation and progression This school has a reputation for excellent Leaving Certificate results and was ranked 112th in the Sunday Times list of the top 400 (out of over 700) secondary schools in Ireland in 2010. Progress to third level runs between 75 and 80%, led by, in order, Dublin City University, Technological University of Dublin, Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin. Facilities Manor House has several science laboratories. There is also a library, renewed in 2017 and opened by past pupil and author Alex Barclay. Sport The school fields teams in a wide range of inter-scholastic sports, including: athletics, badminton, basketball, camogie, cross-country, field hockey, gaelic football and soccer. The school's volleyball team reached the All-Ireland twice, while their gaelic football and camogie teams also reached their respective All-Ireland several times. The field hockey team has reached the Leinster Final once. .

The Ministry of Defence administered academy offers bachelor's degree programs in liberal arts, combined physical sciences, and computer science. The academy is open only to male applicants. The DSA graduates are commissioned in one of the three branches of Myanmar military. History The DSA was established in Fort Ba Htoo in southern Shan State in 1954, and was moved to its current home, a former British hill station of Pyin Oo Lwin (formerly, Maymyo) in June 1957. The first commander of DSA was Col. Thiri Pyanchi Kyaw Soe. Mission The purpose of the academy is to \\"train a new generation of highly educated and well-rounded officers for Myanmar's armed forces who are capable of leading the nation\\". The DSA emphasizes on the academic curriculum alongside the military training with the intention of developing individuals who are capable of running the entire nation. In contrast, the mission of Officer Training School is to train the future commanders who can lead the Armed Forces in times of war. Furthermore, the OTS does not offer any additional academic qualifications, and the admission is usually open only to degree-holders. From 1999 onwards, it is open only to non-commissioned officers and servicemen holding degrees who demonstrate extraordinary qualities to become officers. Training duration is nine months. Admissions As the country's most prestigious military academy, the DSA receives many applications from high school graduates each year. Unlike at most other Burmese universities, the selection process goes beyond the University Entrance Examination matriculation marks, including physical fitness tests, teamwork and comradeship screening, psychometric assessments and general interviews. The academy is open only to male applicants. Programs The DSA offers four-year bachelor's degree programs in liberal arts, combined physical sciences (with specializations in areas such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, geology) and computer science. The undergraduate degree programs used to take four years but from the 42nd intake onwards, the duration has been reduced to three years. The DSA comprises two main branches: the academic wing and the training wing. =Departments= #Deprtment of Myanmar #Department of International Relations # Department of English # Department of Mathematics # Department of Chemistry # Department of Physics # Department of Electronics # Department of Computer =Military education= All cadets receive mandatory military training. The structure of the DSA is based on British and American (i.e. Sandhurst and West Point respectively) military training traditions as well as home-grown practices. In the tradition of American system, the senior cadet officers are assigned to mentor junior cadet officers, overseeing day-to-day training, discipline and welfare of the juniors in general, with the aim of developing the so-called \\"guardian brotherhood\\" so as to develop a sense of community, comradeship, faith and trust, chain of command and looking after one another. This function is supervised by an officer (known as company officer), usually at the rank of Captain, who is then supported by a senior non-commissioned officer, usually at the rank of Master Sergeant. The sergeant more closely interact with the cadet officers and is directly in the chain-of-command, and is similar to the British system. Unlike in American and British systems, which maintain separate military academies for different branches of armed forces, the DSA trains for all three branches of Burmese military (army, navy and air force). Its cadets select the branch to enter upon their graduation, subject to fulfilling further health and training requirements. In general, cadets at the DSA starts their day in the early mornings with rigorous physical training, followed by academic lectures, then by military training. After the exams, they also spend a period devoted solely for military training which take place at various locations across the country. As part of their study requirements, they are taught political science, general law, international relations and other related subjects alongside their main studies regardless of specialism. In common with other universities in the country, the cadets are required to study Burmese, English and mathematics regardless of the subject they major in. The first few weeks of the 1st year is known as \\"soldier indoctrination week\\" when newly recruited cadet officers are trained to have military mentality. Further more, cadet officers are not allowed to keep in touch with the outside world, not even with family (unless under exceptional circumstances such as death of a family member), for the first six months of the first year which is a period meant to transform these young high school graduates from civilians into potential military officers. Cadets are subject to further disciplinary requirements such as having to refrain from visiting the restricted areas of the city and the dress-code both while on DSA grounds and while in the city, even during their private time. The board and room, uniform and food, as well as other essential supplies, for the cadet officers and their tuition costs are borne by the academy. In addition, they also receive a small amount of monthly allowance. In the past, up to 18th Intake, the academy allowed so-called private cadets who are well-qualified, and satisfied by admission board, but do not want military service obligation upon graduation. Such applicants pay tuition fees to the academy and fund their own cost of living while receiving education and training at the academy in exactly as the same way as the other regular cadet officers. Such private cadets are not obliged to serve in the Armed Forces upon graduation. However, they may choose to serve, at their own discretion, in the Armed Forces. Private cadets made up about 5~10% of each intakes. Private cadets are, however, no longer admitted after 18th Intake. The minimum contract of the military service for the regular cadet officers upon graduation is 10 years.

From the outset, Toolstation was designed to be a multi-channel retailer with an emphasis on convenience and reliability. In November 2003, Toolstation opened its first Distribution Centre in Bridgwater, Somerset, and the second branch followed in February 2004 in the same location. By 2008, there were twelve branches in the United Kingdom and a partnership was created with Travis Perkins, which allowed Toolstation to open a further 20 branches. Every year after 2008 at least 20 branches were added and by December 2013 there were 146 Toolstation branches in the UK. In 2009, a dedicated retail Distribution Centre was opened in Redditch. Toolstation has been rapidly opening stores ever since with over 65 opened in 2019 and at least 60 planned for 2020. This has included newer format high street stores in addition to the standard larger retail outlets. In 2012, Mark Goddard Watts agreed to sell his remaining UK shares and in January 2014, as planned, Toolstation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Travis Perkins plc, a supplier of building products for over 200 years and a FTSE 250 listed company. With the backing of the new parent company, Toolstation continued the rapid expansion of its UK branch network and opened another Distribution Centre in Daventry. The Middleton, Greater Manchester distribution centre opened in August 2018 .

It was originally described in 1892 by Leopold Dippel from a cultivated plant as Zelkova japonica var. verschaffeltii, suggesting an eastern Asian origin. In 1896, George Nicholson raised it to species rank as Zelkova verschaffeltii, while its much closer similarity to Zelkova carpinifolia led Augustine Henry to suggest it might be a hybrid between Zelkova carpinifolia and Zelkova abelicea.Bean, W. J. (1980). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles 8th ed., vol. 4. John Murray . More recent authors most widely regarded it as a cultivar, either not ascribed to any Zelkova species in particular, or placed under Z. carpinifolia with no suggestion of hybrid origin.Czerepanov, S. (1957). Revisio specierum generum Zelkova Spach et Hemiptelea Planchon. Bot. Material 18: 58-72.

The oldest figures have been dated to 4600 before the Current Era (BCE) and the most recent to about 2600 BCE. The figures were the first from a hunting culture that were discovered in Scandinavia.Rock Carvings in Tennes: The Discovery (My Little Norway) Discovery and rediscovery Prehistoric rock art (Bergkunst) was first mentioned in 1799 in the travel notes of professor Martin Vahl, where he described a stag carved in the mountain at a farm in Balsfjord. Prof. Vahl was a botanist at Copenhagen University, and the first botanist to visit Northern Norway.Bergkunst (Riksantikvaren)Norwegian However, these notes remained forgotten until 1913, when employees at University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden went through the notes of Prof. Vahl. At that time archeologist had started to gain an interest in rock carvings, and the finding triggered Swedish archeologist Gustaf Hallstr√∂m to travel to Balsfjord to find the rock carving.Gustaf Hallstr√∂ms fotografisamling (Forskningsarkivet)Norwegian To find the carvings located somewhere along the 70 km long fjord, Hallstr√∂m exploited the knowledge that a professor travelling in the 18th century must have lived on one of the ten large farms that existed along Balsfjord. One of these farms was Tennes where the locals recognized Prof. Vahl‚Äôs drawing of the stag. The locals led Hallstr√∂m to Bukkhammaren, where they found the stag and five other animal figures. A few hundred meters away at Gr√•bergan they found additional figures. At this time these were the northernmost rock carvings in the world (today rock carvings have been found further north such as the several thousand figures at Alta). The Gr√•bergan field. Later in 1938 at a meeting in the local knitting circle, the priest's wife showed books describing the rocks carvings above the priest‚Äôs farm. Tordis Larsen from the neighboring farm became inspired and shortly after found the field with most figures at Tennes on the Larsen farm. This field known as Kirkely had about 40 figures. Rock carvings Rock carvings on the Kirkely field. There are about 60 figures distributed over three fields: Bukkhammaren, Gr√•bergan, and Kirkely. The figures were carved in what was at the time of carving on the seashore, but today these are situated about 20 metres above sea level.Walking through the rock carvings at Tennes (My Little Norway) The oldest figures are on Bukkhammaren and these have been dated to 4600 BCE. There are only six figures, five of them are of moose, which all face the same direction. The sixth figure is undetermined. The largest figure is 1.1m. The 40 figures at Kirkely are from about 2700 BCE, and consists of both sea and land animals (a rare combination for rocks carvings in Northern Norway). There are also 2 figures of people in boats, and some unidentified figures. 13 of the figures are of porpoise, while 14 are of moose or reindeer. There is one snake-like figure, and one sk√•lgrop. The largest figure is a reindeer with a length of about 1.2m. The 19 figures at Gr√•bergan are from about 2600 BCE, and show two people figures together with 17 figures of land animals. The size of the figures range from 120 cm. The animals seems to have been carved such that animals migrating between the seashore and mainland are more on the seaside, while animals in the mainland such as bear and moose are away from the sea. Carvers The carvings show that there had been people living at Tennes since the Stone Age. These people were probably hunters, who in the late stone age migrated between different living areas throughout the year. Tennes may already at that time have been a meeting place for the people living in the mainland (mountains), along the seashore, and on the islands. Balsfjord Church where the trail to the rock carvings starts Location The only transportation to Tennes is by car, and it is about a 30-minute drive from the E8-E6 intersection, and about two hours from Troms√∏. Road signs show the direction. The rock carvings are accessible by a 2.5 km long well-marked track starting from Balsfjord Church.

John was educated at a boarding school in Hereford, then in Kendal, following which he went to America with his father to study railway engineering. Returning to the UK, he worked as an engineer, then in 1861 organised the opening of Hucknall Colliery. In 1867, Ellis married Maria Rowntree, the sister of Joshua Rowntree.

In 1870, Ellis formed a Liberal Association in Hucknall, and was elected as the first president of the town's school board, serving until 1882. He was returned to Parliament for the newly created constituency of Rushcliffe in the 1885 general election. In Parliament, he was supporter of Irish Home Rule, and became a committee chairman. He supported the Boers in the Second Boer War, but as his health gradually declined, he became less active after 1902. In December 1905, Ellis was appointed Under-Secretary of State for India in the Liberal administration of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, a post he held until 1907, and was sworn into the Privy Council in January 1906. A radical Liberal, Ellis was amongst those Liberals who supported David Lloyd George's progressive \\"People's Budget\\" of 1909.

In June 1928, McCambridge became one of the first signings for the newly formed Ballymena team and was a goalscoring revelation at the Ballymena Showgrounds - scoring 32 goals including one in the Irish Cup final as the Braidmen shocked Belfast Celtic to win the cup in their first season of senior football. The second season continued with similar success and on 1 February 1930 he became the first Ballymena player to be capped at international level when he played in a 7‚Äì0 win over Wales. He retained his place for the next International three weeks later, as Ireland lost to Scotland at Parkhead. =Professional career= Shortly after the Scotland game, McCambridge secured a ¬£1,750 transfer to Everton. However, he spent just three months at Goodison Park, making one appearance in place of Dixie Dean in a 3-0 win over Bradford City in the FA Cup.

He finished the season with 9 goals, including a hat-trick against Stoke City. His first full season at the club the next year yielded a total of 28 goals in all competitions and, with 26 of the goals scored in the league, he broke the club record of league goals scored in a single season set by Hughie Ferguson four years earlier by one. His record stood for 15 years until it was broken by Stan Richards in the 1946-47 season. The following season, McCambridge was unable to match his goalscoring feat of the previous year but still finished as the club's top scorer with 18 goals in all competitions. Despite finishing as Cardiff's top scorer in his two full seasons at Ninian Park, as well as winning the final two Ireland caps of his career in matches against Wales and England, he was allowed to leave in 1933 to join Bristol Rovers.

The word is derived from Latin sternere (\\"to strew\\", i.e. hay, straw). The strator (in Greek narrative sources often replaced with the Greek equivalent of hippokomos) was typically a soldier, sometimes even a centurion, who was chosen from the ranks to act as a groom for a senior officer or civil official. His tasks included attending to and even procuring horses, and the supervision of the stable. In the Roman Empire, the stratores of the imperial court formed a distinct corps, the schola stratorum, headed by the Count of the Stable (comes stabuli), and later, in the middle Byzantine period, the protostrator (œÄœÅœâœÑŒøœÉœÑœÅŒ¨œÑœâœÅ, \\"first strator\\"). In the provincial administration, senior stratores chosen among centurions etc. were typically members of the staff of Roman governors and in turn headed other, more junior stratores. In the Byzantine Empire, the title was more generally used as an honorific dignity for mid-level civil and military officials from the 8th century on, which led to the actual grooms of the imperial court being distinguished as \\"stratores of the imperial stratorikion\\". The dignity of the strator belonged to those intended for \\"bearded men\\" (i.e. non-eunuchs), and was conferred by the award of an insigne (dia brabeiou axia), in this case a jewelled gold whip. It ranked relatively low in the imperial hierarchy: in the Kletorologion of 899, it ranks sixth from the bottom, above the kandidatos and below the hypatos. The title appears in Western Europe from the mid-8th century onwards, possibly under Byzantine influence. The variant form starator is attested in the Kingdom of Cyprus in 1402.

He championed the development of various sports and sporting events in the United States, most notably the Boston Marathon and amateur ice hockey. From 1904 to 1936, Brown served the United States Olympic Team as a manager, official, and coach. In 1919, he became general manager of the Boston Arena, home to indoor track meets, boxing matches, and hockey games, among other events. Biography He was born on October 21, 1880. He was the assistant manager at the 1920 Summer Olympics. He died on October 17, 1937. Boston Athletic Association and Boston Marathon In 1899 Brown was hired as an assistant to the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) Athletic Director. For 33 years, from 1905 to 1937, Brown served as starter of the BAA's Boston Marathon, the oldest annually run marathon. For eleven of those years, he also managed the race. From 1905 to 1921, Brown managed the BAA track and field games, and for over twenty years, served as the BAA Director of Athletics. In 1910 Brown started and managed an ice hockey team, and formed a football team for the BAA. Brown also served on the BAA Governing Committee for 20 years, having transitioned from club employee to club member and leader. Ice hockey During Brown's youth, ice hockey was in its infancy in the United States. In 1910 Brown formed and managed an amateur ice hockey team for the BAA, which played at the newly constructed Boston Arena. Over the next two decades, Brown organized hockey events held at the Arena, including Canadian-American games and collegiate competitions. When the Arena burnt down in 1918, Brown persuaded its owner, Henry G. Lapham, to rebuild. Brown was then named general manager and promoted hockey as its major draw. In 1934 Lapham purchased the rival Garden, and named Brown as its general manager and vice president. When professional hockey was first introduced and its teams sought to play at Boston's rinks, Brown opposed, favoring amateur competition. He later accepted the professionals and promoted the Boston Bruins playing at the Boston Garden. Brown served as athletic director at Boston University (BU) and in 1917, was instrumental in the creation of the school's first hockey team. The BU hockey team's annual Most Valuable Player award is named the George V. Brown Memorial Award, in his honor. For the first 1924 Winter Olympics, Brown organized the U.S. Olympic Hockey team, with seven of the ten members coming from the BAA team. The team earned a silver medal. Because of his contributions to the emerging field of hockey, in 1961, Brown was inducted into the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Canada, as a Builder. He was also enshrined as a Builder by the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in Eveleth, Minnesota, in 1973.

It is one of the most important hubs in the country and is one of the 3 Belgian stations on the high-speed rail network. The station is used by 15,000(xls) people every day which makes it the eleventh busiest station in Belgium and the third in Wallonia. History In the 1970s. In 1905. In 1838, only three years after the first continental railway, a line linking Brussels and Ans, in the northern suburbs of Li√®ge, was opened. The first railway station of Li√®ge-Guillemins was inaugurated in May 1842, linking the valley to the upper Ans station. In 1843, the first international railway connection was born, linking Li√®ge to Aachen and Cologne. The station was modernised and improved in 1882 and in 1905 for the World Fair in Li√®ge. This Beaux-Arts station was replaced in 1958 by a modern International style building that was used until June 2009, a few months before the opening of the new Calatrava-designed station. The second station was completely demolished to allow the completion of the remaining sections of the new station. New station inside view (2013) At the end of the 20th century high speed trains were introduced, requiring a new station since the existing platforms were too small. The new station, by the architect Santiago Calatrava, was officially opened on 18 September 2009, with a show by Franco Dragone. It has 9 tracks and 5 platforms (three of 450 m and two of 350 m). All the tracks around the station have been modernised to allow high speed arrival and departure. The new station is made of steel, glass and white concrete. It includes a monumental arch, 160 metres long and 32 metres high. The building costs were ‚Ç¨312 million. Services Li√®ge-Guillemins station is served by InterCity and InterRegio trains, connecting Li√®ge with all major Belgian cities as well as several international destinations such as Aachen, Lille, and Maastricht. In addition to the national trains, Li√®ge-Guillemins station welcomes Thalys and ICE trains, connecting Li√®ge to Brussels, Paris, Aachen, Cologne and Frankfurt. Two new dedicated high-speed tracks were built: HSL 2 (Brussels-Li√®ge) and HSL 3 (Li√®ge-German border). There are also plans for Eurostar and ICE to link Li√®ge directly to London. The station is served by the following services: *High speed services (Thalys) Paris - Brussels - Li√®ge - Aachen - Cologne - D√ºsseldorf - Essen - Dortmund *High speed services (ICE) Brussels - Li√®ge - Aachen - Cologne - Frankfurt *Intercity services (IC-01) Ostend - Bruges - Gent - Brussels - Leuven - Li√®ge - Welkenraedt - Eupen *Intercity services (IC-09) Antwerp - Lier - Aarschot - Hasselt - Li√®ge (weekends) *Intercity services (IC-12) Kortrijk - Gent - Brussels - Leuven - Li√®ge - Welkenraedt (weekdays) *Intercity services (IC-13) Hasselt - Liers - Li√®ge - Vis√® - Maastricht (weekdays) *Intercity services (IC-13) Li√®ge - Vis√® - Maastricht (weekends) *Intercity services (IC-14) Qui√©vrain - Mons - Braine- le-Comte - Brussels - Leuven - Li√®ge (weekdays) *Intercity services (IC-18) Brussels - Namur - Li√®ge (weekdays) *Intercity services (IC-25) Mons - Charleroi - Namur - Huy - Li√®ge (weekdays) *Intercity services (IC-25) Mouscron - Tournai - Saint-Ghislain - Mons - Charleroi - Namur - Huy - Li√®ge - Liers (weekends) *Intercity services (IC-33) Liers - Li√®ge - Rivage - Vielsalm - Troisvierges - Ettelbruck - Luxembourg *Local services (L-01) Namur - Huy - Li√®ge *Local services (L-15) Liers - Li√®ge - Esneux - Rivage - Marche-en- Famenne - Marloie *Local services (L-17) Herstal - Li√®ge - Pepinster - Verviers *Local services (L-21) Waremme - Liege (weekdays) *Local services (L-21) Landen - Waremme - Liege (weekends) The national trains to Brussels also use the high speed track at 200 km/h, while the Thalys and ICE can go up to 300 km/h (bring Brussels at only 39' minutes from Li√®ge). Road connections Li√®ge-Guillemins is also a transport hub for TEC Bus: more than 1620 buses, carrying 15,000 people, serve the station every day. It is one of the few railway stations in Europe directly connected to a motorway (E40-E25). The connection gives direct access to the 850-place parking structure, behind the station.

Early life Kaikini was born in Gokarna to Gourish Kaikini, a school teacher, and a Kannada litterateur and Shanta, a social worker. After a Masters in Biochemistry from Karnataka University, Dharwad, he moved to Mumbai where he worked as a chemist for many years. He now lives in Bangalore with his wife Smita and two children, Srajana (daughter) who is an Odissi dancer and a researcher/curator, and Ritwik(son), a multimedia artist.http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=63125&n;_tit=B'lore%3A+Srajana+Kaikini+wins+International+Recognition+for+Creative+Architectural+Concept Apart from Kannada, Jayanth is fluent in Konkani (his mother tongue), Marathi, Hindi and English. Career Kaikini is regarded as one of the most significant of the younger writers in Kannada today. He is a writer of short stories, film scripts and poetry, and is based in Bangalore. His poetry is characterised by subtle imagism, a minute documentation of the seemingly commonplace, a colloquial idiom and a conscientious refusal to engage in any poeticising. He has so far published six anthologies of short stories, four books of poetry, three plays and a collection of essays. In an introduction to Dots and Lines, an English translation of Kaikini's short stories, critic C.N. Ramachandran writes, ‚ÄúTo understand Jayanth's works, we have to situate him in the literary context of the last two decades of the 20th century. During that period, there arose a group of writers who consciously differed from both the earlier Modernist writers (called Navya in Kannada) and those contemporaneous to them, the Writers of Protest (called Bandaya in Kannada) and Dalit writers. They did not subscribe to any particular philosophical or political system of thinking ‚Äì be it Existentialism of the Modernists or the Leftist ideologies of the Dalit and Protest writers. On the other hand, what they wished to do was to select precise and authentic details of daily life and organise them in such a way as to culminate in a particular experience . . . Generally, their style was comic-ironic; and the language they used was the spoken language of day-to-day life. They were neither idealists nor cynics; they just wished to observe the life around them ‚Äì generally mediocre ‚Äì to register all the fleeting details that marked an ordinary man's daily routine, and lead up to an experience rich in connotations. Jayanth was a major figure in this group of writers who, loosely, can be called ‚Äòpost-modernist‚Äô.‚Äù Dr. Jayanth Kaikini started writing lyrics to film songs beginning from movie Chigurida Kanasu. Kannada film actor and singer Dr.Rajkumar sung \\"Bandhuve O Bandhuve\\", Kaikini's debut song, for which V. Manohar composed the music. He is the credited with revolutionising the image of Kannada film songs, with the classic touch of literature and beautiful imagery. Films like Mungaaru Male, Gaalipata, Milana etc. have some touching and memorable songs with lyrics penned by him. He was hosting a TV Show \\"Rasa Rushige Namaskara\\" in Etv Kannada which a biography on Rashtrakavi Kuvempu. This show was very popular with a particular section of audience. He continued it with other series' such as \\"Kadala Theerada Bharghava\\",..etc.Lately he was seen judging the reality show \\"Yede tumbi Haaduvenu\\" along with the legendary singer S.P.Balasubrahmanyam and famous Kannada music director and lyricist naada brahma Hamsalekha. Kaikini received the Karnataka Sahitya Academy award for his first poetry collection at the age of nineteen in 1974. He received the same award again in 1982, 1989 and 1996 for his short story collections. He has been awarded the Dinakara Desai award for his poetry, the B. H.

In Greek mythology, Tithonus was a Trojan by birth, the son of King Laomedon of Troy by a water nymph named Strymo (\\"harsh\\"). Eos,Aurora was the Roman equivalent of Eos. In Roman mythology, it is Zeus's Roman equivalent Jupiter who grants Tithonus immortality on her asking. the Greek goddess of the dawn, abducted Ganymede and Tithonus from the royal house of Troy to be her consorts. When Zeus stole Ganymede from her to be his cup-bearer, as a repayment, Eos asked for Tithonus to be made immortal, but forgot to ask for eternal youth. Tithonus indeed lived forever but grew ever older.This story is imbedded in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite. Anchises was another Trojan who was abducted by Aphrodite. Tithonus is mentioned as an example by Aphrodite, 218ff. In later tellings, Eos eventually turned him into a cricket to relieve him of such an existence. In the poem however, it is Eos, and not Zeus, who grants Tithonus immortality. In the poem, Tithonus asks Eos for the gift of immortality, which she readily grants him, but forgets to ask for eternal youth along with it. As time wears on, age catches up with him. Wasted and withered, Tithonus is reduced to a mere shadow of himself. But since he is immortal, he cannot die and is destined to live forever, growing older and older with each passing day. The main classical source that Tennyson draws upon is from the story of Aphrodite's relationship with Anchises in the ancient Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite.Markley, p. 127. In this Aphrodite briefly tells of Eos's foolishness in neglecting to ask Zeus for immortal youth for Tithonus along with his immortality. The original version of the poem, named \\"Tithon\\", was written in 1833 shortly after Tennyson's friend Arthur Henry Hallam's death but was not published.Rowlinson, p. 156 When William Makepeace Thackeray asked him for a submission to the Cornhill Magazine to be issued in January 1860 which he was editing, Tennyson made some substantial revisions to the text of the poemMarkley, p. 129 and submitted it under the title \\"Tithonus\\". It was published in the February edition. It was finally published by Tennyson in an anthology in the Enoch Arden volume in 1864. Synopsis and structure The poem begins with Tithonus speaking to Eos \\"at the quiet limit of the world\\" (line 7) where he lives with her. Confronted with old age and its attendant pains, he meditates upon death and mortality, and mourns the fact that death cannot release him from his misery. He recounts how Eos, choosing him to be her lover, had filled him with so much pride that he had seemed \\"To his great heart none other than a God!\\" (14). Though she carelessly granted him immortality at his asking, he could not escape the ravages of time. The Hours aged him and his youth and beauty faded away‚àí-\\"But thy strong Hours indignant work'd their wills / And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me\\" (18‚Äì19). He asks Eos to set him free‚àí-\\"Let me go; take back thy gift\\" (27)‚àí-and questions why anyone should desire that which is unattainable. thumb140pxrightDawn (1881) by William-Adolphe Bouguereau. Eos was the Greek goddess of the dawn. Eos departs at dawn without replying to his wish that she take back the boon of immortality. As she leaves, her tears fall on his cheek. This fills him with the foreboding that the saying he had learnt on earth, that even \\"The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts\\"(49), might be true. He remembers his youth when he would feel his whole body come alive at dawn as Eos kissed him and whispered to him words \\"wild and sweet\\" (61), which seemed like the song Apollo sang as Ilion (Troy) was being built. In the final section, weary of life and immortality, he yearns for death to take him. He feels that \\"men that have the power to die\\" (70) are happy and fortunate. Since his \\"immortal age\\" (22) can no longer be reconciled with Eos' \\"immortal youth\\" (22), he once more begs her: Release me, and restore me to the ground; Thou seest all things, thou wilt see my grave: Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn; I earth in earth forget these empty courts, And thee returning on thy silver wheels. (72‚Äì76) Interpretations The first version of \\"Tithonus\\" was one of four poems that also included \\"Morte d'Arthur\\", \\"Ulysses\\", and \\"Tiresias\\" which were written by Tennyson following the death of his friend, Arthur Henry Hallam. His death greatly influenced much of Tennyson's later poetry. According to critic Mary Donahue, \\"It is not that anything so obvious and simple as the identification of Eos with Hallam is possible or that the emotional relationship between Tennyson and Hallam is wholly clarified by 'Tithonus' But it is clear that, in choosing the mask of Tithonus, Tennyson reached out to two of the most basic symbols, those of love between man and woman and the frustration of love by age, to express the peculiar nature of his own emotional injury.\\"Quoted in Markley, p. 127 Victorian scholar Matthew Reynolds wrote, \\"Grieving for Arthur Hallam, Tennyson wrote poems which describe what they themselves possess: a life unusually, but not eternally, prolonged through time.\\"Reynolds, Matthew (2001). The Realms of Verse, 1830‚Äì1870: English Poetry in a Time of Nation-Building. Oxford University Press, p. 248. . Tithonus's suffering is a reminder of the futility of attempting to \\"pass beyond the goal of ordinance\\" (30). It is a poignant expression of the inevitability of death and of the necessity of accepting it as such. Tithonus has to bear the consequences of varying from \\"the kindly race of men\\" (29). Though he succeeds in defying death, his youth and beauty desert him in his old age. He can only ask for release. But death does not come to him later even when he begs for it. He is destined to live forever as a \\"white-haired shadow\\" (8) and forever roam \\"the ever-silent spaces of the East\\" (9). In being immortal, Tithonus ceases to be himself, sacrifices his mortal identity.Cain, p.66 Tennyson described \\"Tithonus\\" in a letter as \\"a pendent to the \\"Ulysses\\" in my former volumes.\\"Quoted in Rowlinson, p. 145 Tithonus's character offers a strong contrast to that of Ulysses. The two poems are matched and opposed as the utterances of Greek and Trojan, victor and vanquished, hero and victim.Cain, p. 65 According to critic William E. Cain, \\"Tithonus has discovered the curse of fulfillment, of having his carelessly worded wish come true. He lives where no man ought to live, on the other side of the horizon, the other side of the border that Ulysses could only plan to cross. According to Victorian scholar A. A. Markley, \\"Tithonus\\" offers a viewpoint opposite to that of \\"Ulysses\\" on the theme of the acceptance of death. He writes that \\"while 'Ulysses' explores the human spirit that refuses to accept death, 'Tithonus' explores the human acceptance of the inevitability, and even the appropriateness, of death as the end of the life cycle. The two poems offer two extreme views of facing death, each one which balances the other when they are read together‚àí clearly one of Tennyson's original intentions when he first drafted them in 1833. Nevertheless, reading 'Tithonus' purely as a pendant to 'Ulysses' has led to unnecessarily reductive readings of both poems.\\" Legacy The title of After Many a Summer, a novel by Aldous Huxley originally published in 1939 and retitled After Many a Summer Dies the Swan when published in the USA, is taken from the fourth line of the poem. It tells the story of a Hollywood millionaire who, fearing his impending death, employs a scientist to help him achieve immortality. A season 6 episode of The X-Files entitled \\"Tithonus\\" tells the story of a man cursed with immortality who works as a photographer taking photos of individuals whom he can sense are close to death. He snaps these photos hoping to see the Grim Reaper and to die, finally, after having spent decades trapped in the land of the living. Notes References  * Bibliography * Tennyson, Hallam.

Theodore Too is currently located in Bedford, Nova Scotia History Theodore Too was commissioned by Cochran Entertainment, Inc., the now-defunct production company. Andrew Cochran, the creator of Theodore Tugboat, had told his son bedtime stories about the boats in the big harbour and how they interacted with everyone. This later became the basis for the TV series. Theodore became so popular, the company constructed a life-size model of him for marketing and promoting water safety. The boat is unusual, as it is a full-size replica of a scale model. The original model which was used to film the series and inspired Theodore Too can be seen at Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. Theodore Too was built at Snyder's Shipyard in Dayspring, Nova Scotia and launched on April 19, 2000. After sea trials out of Lunenburg, the vessel made its first port call to Halifax on May 6, 2000. The ocean-going boat made a 50-city tour down the eastern seaboard to Tampa Bay and back again through the Great Lakes to Chicago. Theodore Too became the Ambassador of the U.S. National Safe Boating Council and mascot to the U.S. Coast Guard, participating in several tall ship events. For most if its time touring the eastern seaboard and Great Lakes, Theodore Too had a full-time three-person crew, headed by Captain Bill Stewart, a 25-year veteran tugboat captain, who also had an additional nine years as a 44-foot motor lifeboat coxswain in the Canadian Coast Guard. After Cochran Entertainment went out of business, the boat was purchased by a Halifax tour boat company, Murphys on the Water. The vessel provides tours of Halifax Harbour in the summer, operating from the Cable Wharf in downtown Halifax. On July 16, 2020, Ambassatours announced plans to sell Theodore Too. Specifications Norwegian Sea at Halifax Harbour, 2003 The boat was designed by Fred Allen and naval architect Marius Lengkeek of Lengkeek Vessel Engineering, and was built by Snyder's Shipyard in Dayspring, Nova Scotia, on the Lahave River, not far from Bridgewater, Nova Scotia. The hull and wheelhouse are made entirely of wood, with a fibreglass hat and smokestack. It has a 'face' on the wheelhouse, with large realistic hydraulic eyes which are no longer operational. The boat displays a number of prop details such as winches and towing bitts inspired from real tugs but operates as a tour boat, not a real tug boat.

Life Steel line engraving prepared to accompany Carne's work Syria, The Holy Land, Asia Minor, &c.; Illustrated John Carne was born on 18 June 1789 in Penzance, Cornwall, the fourth son of five known children of the family. His father, William Carne (1754-1836), was a merchant, mining agent, shipowner and banker at Penzance, where he died on 4 July 1836 at the age of 81; William married in 1780 Miss Anna Cock, daughter of Francis Cock of Helston, who died on 8 November 1822. His eldest brother was Joseph Carne FRS, the noted geologist and mineral collector. Carne was a member of Queens' College, Cambridge, at different times both before and after his journey to the East, but he never resided long enough for a degree. He was admitted in 1826 to deacon's orders by Dr Matthew Henry Thornhill Luscombe, the chaplain of the British embassy at Paris, and a bishop of the Episcopal church of Scotland; but, except during a few months' residence at Vevey in Switzerland, he did not officiate as a clergyman. However, as a younger man, living in West Cornwall and from a committed Methodist family, he had frequently preached with other local preachers at chapels in Penzance and Newlyn. His father, a strict man of business aside from his active service to Wesleyan Methodism [William Carne has frequently been called 'the father of Cornish Methodism'], desired that his son should follow in his footsteps, as Joseph had done. However, after a short trial of business, during which John's literary and story-telling abilities showed themselves, his father allowed him to follow his own inclinations. His first literary production was brought out anonymously in 1820, and was called Poems containing the Indian and Lazarus. Carne resolved to visit the holy places, and accordingly left England on 26 March 1821. He visited Constantinople, Greece, the Levant, Egypt, and Palestine. In the latter country, while returning from the convent of St Catharine, he was taken prisoner by Bedouins, but, after being detained for some days, was released in safety. On coming back to England he commenced writing for the New Monthly Magazine an account of his travels, under the title of Letters from the East, receiving from Henry Colburn twenty guineas for each article. These Letters were then reproduced in a volume, dedicated to Sir Walter Scott, which went to a third edition. This book is noticeable for the fact that there is not a single date to be found in it except that on the title-page. The publication of this work and his talents for society brought him into familiar intercourse with Walter Scott, Southey, Campbell, Lockhart, Jerdan, and other distinguished men of letters. He next published Tales of the West, 1828, 2 vols., treating of his native county. Among those who knew him his fame as a story-teller far exceeded his renown as a writer, and social company often gathered round him to be spellbound by some exciting or pathetic narration. During the latter part of his life he resided chiefly in Penzance. Oppressed by the infirmities of a premature old age, he had ceased for some years before his death to engage in any literary pursuits. While preparing to set out for the shores of the Mediterranean he was attacked with a sudden illness and died at Penzance on 19 April 1844, when his remains were buried in Gulval churchyard. Works Letters from Switzerland and Italy, 1834 Besides the works already mentioned, Carne was the author of: * Letters from the East 1826, London, Henry Colburn * Stratton Hill, a Tale of the Civil War 1829, 3 vols * Recollections of Travels in the East 1830 * The Exiles of Palestine, a Tale of the Holy Land 1831, 3 vols * Lives of Eminent Missionaries 1833, 3 vols * Letters from Switzerland and Italy 1834 * Lives of Eminent Missionaries 1844 * Lives of Eminent Missionaries 1852, 3 vols The term motley crew may have gained family from Recollections of Travels in the East: \\"Away they marched from the rocky region and miserable village where they were posted, a motley crew of Christians and Infidels, Catholics, Greeks, and adorers of the Prophet, all mingled together, to go and attack the holy city.\\" He was also a writer in the New Monthly Magazine, the Forget-me-not, the Gem, the Keepsake, and other works. Family At the age of 25, in 1824, he married Ellen, daughter of Mr Lane, a drawing-master of Worcester. Her brother Theodore Lane, an artist and exhibitioner at the Royal Academy, died after falling through a skylight at the horse bazaar in Gray's Inn Lane on 21 May 1828, when his daughter Emma was adopted by her uncle. Mrs Carne married, secondly, Henry Harrington Clay, and died at Penzance on 2 February 1868, aged 67.

They are tools of verification, and as in the problem of the criterion, the reliability of these tools is disputed. Understanding a philosophy's criteria of truth is fundamental to a clear evaluation of that philosophy. This necessity is driven by the varying, and conflicting, claims of different philosophies. The rules of logic have no ability to distinguish truth on their own. An individual must determine what standards distinguish truth from falsehood. Not all criteria are equally valid. Some standards are sufficient, while others are questionable. The criteria listed represent those most commonly used by scholars and the general public.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, pg. 3. Authority The opinions of those with significant experience, highly trained or possessing an advanced degree are often considered a form of proof. Their knowledge and familiarity within a given field or area of knowledge command respect and allow their statements to be criteria of truth. A person may not simply declare themselves an authority, but rather must be properly qualified. Despite the wide respect given to expert testimony, it is not an infallible criterion. For example, multiple authorities may conflict in their claims and conclusions.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, pp. 8-9. Coherence Coherence refers to a consistent and overarching explanation for all facts. To be coherent, all pertinent facts must be arranged in a consistent and cohesive fashion as an integrated whole. The theory that most effectively reconciles all facts in this fashion may be considered most likely to be true. Coherence is the most potentially effective test of truth because it most adequately addresses all elements. The main limitation lies not in the standard, but in the human inability to acquire all facts of an experience. Only an omniscient mind could be aware of all of the relevant information. A scholar must accept this limitation and accept as true the most coherent explanation for the available facts. Coherence is difficult to dispute as a criterion of truth, since arguing against coherence is validating incoherence, which is inherently illogical.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, pp. 10-11. Consensus gentium Some view opinions held by all people to be valid criteria of truth. According to consensus gentium, the universal consent of all mankind (all humans holding a distinct belief), proves it is true. There is some value in the criterion if it means innate truth, such as the laws of logic and mathematics. If it merely means agreement, as in a unanimous vote, its value is questionable. For example, general assent once held that the sun revolved about the earth.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, p. 7. Consistency (mere) Mere consistency is when correct statements do not contradict, but are not necessarily related. Accordingly, an individual is consistent if he does not contradict himself. It is inadequate as a criterion because it treats facts in an isolated fashion without true cohesion and integration; nevertheless it remains a necessary condition for the truth of any argument, owing to the law of noncontradiction. The value of a proof largely lies in its ability to reconcile individual facts into a coherent whole.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, p. 10. Consistency (strict) Strict consistency is when claims are connected in such a fashion that one statement follows from another. Formal logic and mathematical rules are examples of rigorous consistency. An example would be: if all As are Bs and all Bs are Cs, then all As are Cs. While this standard is of high value, it is limited. For example, the premises are a priori (or self-apparent), requiring another test of truth to employ this criterion. Additionally, strict consistency may produce results lacking coherence and completeness. While a philosophical system may demonstrate rigorous consistency with the facts it considers, all facts must be taken into consideration for an adequate criterion of truth, regardless of their detriment to any given system. Correspondence Correspondence is quite simply when a claim corresponds with its object. For example, the claim that the White House is in Washington, D.C. is true, if the White House is actually located in Washington. Correspondence is held by many philosophers to be the most valid of the criteria of truth. An idea that corresponds to its object is indeed true, but determining if the correspondence is perfect requires additional tests of truth. This indicates that correspondence is a perfectly valid definition of truth, but is not of itself a valid criterion of truth. An additional test beyond this \\"definition\\" is required to determine the precise degree of similarity between what is posited and what exists in objective reality.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, p. 8. Establishing correspondence between what is posited and what exists is fraught with its own difficulties, see Map‚Äìterritory relation. Custom Most people consciously or unknowingly employ custom as a criterion of truth, based on the assumption that doing what is customary will prevent error. It is particularly applied in the determination of moral truth and reflected in the statement \\"when in Rome, do as the Romans do\\". People stick closely to the principle of custom when they use common vernacular, wear common fashions and so forth; essentially, when they do what is popular. Custom is not considered a serious, or valid, test of truth. For example, public opinion polls do not determine truth.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, p. 4. Emotions Many people allow feelings to determine judgment, often in the face of contrary evidence or without even attempting to collect evidence and facts. They are implicitly accepting emotions as a criterion of truth. Most people will admit that feelings are not an adequate test for truth. For example, a seasoned businessman will put aside his emotions and search for the best available facts when making an investment. Similarly, scholars are trained to put aside such subjective judgments when evaluating knowledge.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, p. 5. Emotions are real, however, and thus must be considered within any social scientific system of coherence. Instinct The existence of distinct instincts has long been debated. Proponents of instinct argue that we eat because of hunger, drink because of thirst, and so forth. Some have even argued for the existence of God based on this criterion, arguing that the object of every instinct has a referent in reality. The counterpoint of hunger is food; for thirst it is liquid; for the sex drive it is a mate. Instincts are not accepted as a reliable test because they are most often indistinct, variant and difficult to define. Additionally, universal instincts are so few that they offer little to the greater body of philosophy as a criterion.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, pp. 5-6. Intuition Intuition is an assumed truth with an unknown, or possibly unexamined, source. It is a judgment that is not dependent on a rational examination of the facts. It is usually experienced as a sudden sensation and/or rush of thoughts that feel \\"right\\". Many persons experience intuitive epiphanies which later prove to be true. Scholars have sometimes come upon valid theories and proofs while daydreaming or otherwise mentally occupied with something bearing no apparent relationship to the truth they seek to reveal. Intuition is at best a source for truths, rather than a criterion with which to evaluate them. Intuitive knowledge requires testing by means of other criteria of truth in order to confirm its accuracy.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, p. 6. Majority rule Majority rule is a statistical method of accepting assertions and proposals. In democratic systems, majority rule is used to determine group decisions, particularly those relating to personal morality and social behavior. Some systems divided into several oppositional factions may depend on mere plurality. While majority rule may make for a good democratic system, it is a poor determinant of truth, subject to the criticisms of the broad version of consensus gentium. Na√Øve realism Na√Øve realism posits that only that which is directly observable by the human senses is true. First-hand observation determines the truth or falsity of a given statement. Na√Øve Realism is an insufficient criterion of truth. A host of natural phenomena are demonstrably true, but not observable by the unaided sense. For example, Na√Øve Realism would deny the existence of sounds beyond the range of human hearing and the existence of x-rays. Similarly, there are a number of sense experiments which show a disconnect between the perceived sensation and the reality of its cause.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, pp. 7-8. Pragmatic If an idea works then it must be true, to the Pragmatist. The consequences of applying a concept reveal its truth value upon examination of the results. The full meaning of an idea is self-apparent in its application. For example, the therapeutic value and effect of penicillin in relation to infections is proven in its administration. Although Pragmatism is considered a valuable criterion, it must be used with caution and reservation, due to its potential for false positives. For example, a doctor may prescribe a patient medication for an illness, but it could later turn out that a placebo is equally effective. Thus, untrue concepts could appear to be working contrary to the purpose of the pragmatic test. However, it has validity as a test, particularly in the form William Ernest Hocking called \\"Negative Pragmatism\\". In essence, it states that ideas that do not work cannot possibly be true, though ideas which do work may or may not be true.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas of the Great Philosophers, p. 9. Revelation The principal distinction between intuition and revelation is that revelation has an assumed source: God (or another higher power). Revelation may be defined as truth emanating from God. Many religions fundamentally rely on revelation as a test of truth. This criterion is subject to the same criticisms as intuition. It may be a valid reference of truth for an individual, but it is inadequate for providing a coherent proof of the knowledge to others.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, pp. 6-7. Time Time is a criterion commonly appealed to in debate, often referred to as \\"the test of time\\". This criterion posits that over time erroneous beliefs and logical errors will be revealed, while if the belief is true, the mere passage of time cannot adversely affect its validity. Time is an inadequate test for truth, since it is subject to similar flaws as custom and tradition (which are simply specific variations of the time factor). Many demonstrably false beliefs have endured for centuries and even millennia (e.g. vitalism). It is commonly rejected as a valid criterion. For example, most people will not convert to another faith simply because the other religion is centuries (or even millennia) older than their current beliefs.Sahakian & Sahakian, Ideas, pp. 4-5. Tradition Tradition, closely related to custom, is the standard stating that which is held for generations is true. Those accepting tradition argue that ideas gaining the loyalty multiple generations possesses a measure of credibility. Tradition possesses many of the same failings as custom. It is possible for falsehoods to be passed down from generation to generation, since tradition generally emphasizes repetition over critical evaluation.

Early life Carne was born at Penzance, Cornwall, United Kingdom, the eldest son of William Carne, a banker, and his wife Anna Carne n√©e Cock of Helston. He was educated at home and at the Wesleyan school, Keynsham, near Bristol. One of his four younger brothers was the author and traveller John Carne. From an early age Carne showed an interest in mineralogy and geology. He was in the habit of walking round to the copper mines, and collecting specimens of the rarer ores, which the miners were glad to sell at low prices, thereby forming the nucleus of his mineralogical collection. On 23 March 1808 he married Mary Thomas, the daughter of William Thomas of Kidwelly, MD, physician at Haverfordwest. After his marriage he lived for a short time at Penzance, and in 1808 he removed to Rivi√®re House, Phillack on being appointed manager of the Cornish Copper Company's smelting works at Hayle. His good business habits and quickness at figures well fitted him for this situation. Seven of his eight children (two boys and five girls) were born at Rivi√®re House, before he resigned his role as manager (remaining an investor like his father) and returned to Penzance. His youngest son was born and died in their home in Chapel Street, Penzance. Career Carne was a close observer, and paid special attention to the granitic veins of St Michael's Mount, and the vein-like lines of porphyritic rocks provincially termed elvans. In 1816 and 1818 Carne communicated to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall his investigation On Elvan Courses, in which he established their general characters and fixed the probable dates of their intrusion into the granite masses and the clay-slates. The Granite of the Western part of Cornwall and the Geology of the Scilly Isles were additional communications made to the local geological society. After studying the formation of mineral veins, in 1818 he sent a paper to the Geological Society of Cornwall entitled On the relative Age of the Veins of Cornwall. This inquiry led, some years after, to the formation of a fund by subscription, which enabled William Jory Henwood to devote all his leisure, for many years, to personal observations in every mining field in Cornwall. These inquiries led to Carne being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 28 May 1818. In 1821 he published his paper On the Mineral Productions and the Geology of the Parish of St. Just. This work led to the collection of Cornish minerals, which he left in his Will to the care of his daughter Elizabeth. After her death in 1873, they became part of the family estate in the possession of Charles Campbell Ross, formerly MP for St. Ives. The Carne Mineral Collection was purchased for Cambridge University, by a coalition of sponsors and patrons keen to see it preserved, from the bankruptcy sale of the Carne bank's assets in the 1890s. See 'Fall of the House of Carne' on-line. The Carne Collection forms part of the large geological collections exhibited in the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, Cambridge. Carne's paper On the Pseudo-morphous Minerals of Cornwall was calculated to throw light on the mysterious changes which occur in minerals. In connection with this subject Carne also examined most of the varieties of tin ore which have been found in veins, and such as are peculiar to the deposits in stream works. In 1846 a paper was read by Carne On the Remains of a Submarine Forest in the North-eastern part of the Mount's Bay, and in 1851 Notice of a Raised Beach lately discovered in Zennor will be found in the pages of the Transactions of the Cornwall Geological Society, vol. vii. Carne also wrote on the history of copper mining, and on the improvements made in its metallurgy‚Äîon the discovery of ancient coins‚Äîon the formation of the blown sands of the north coasts of the county, and contributed a paper to the Statistical Society of London entitled Statistics of the Tin Mines in Cornwall and of the Consumption of Tin in Great Britain. Carne was an honorary member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. In 1837 he was picked for Sheriff of Cornwall but did not accept the appointment. For many years he was the treasurer of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and due to his extensive knowledge of the laws of mines and minerals, and his intimate acquaintance with local usages, he was referred to in most cases of difficulty. Later life All the Wesleyan chapels of West Cornwall sought Carne's assistance and advice. He took charge of Sunday schools, and kept a large stock of books for the teachers. In 1820 Carne left Hayle, and went to Penzance to become a partner in his father's bank (Batten, Carne, & Carne). He died at Penzance on 12 October 1858. His daughter, Elizabeth Catherine Thomas Carne was also a noted geologist. Upon Joseph's death his large mineral collection became her responsibility and she continued to collect specimens and created a private museum. She also assumed his place as Managing Partner of the family bank, until her own demise in 1873.

They played at the protests for homosexual law reform in 1983, with member Little Stevie McCabe being severely beaten up in the Christchurch Cathedral Square toilets. The Axemen's founding members, Bob Brannigan, Little Stevie McCabe and Stu Kawowski had played in various bands, apart and together, in the South Island cities of Christchurch and Dunedin. Before Bob Brannigan and Steve McCabe met, Steve was playing in a two-piece band at Cashmere High School called The Gorillas with Peter Rees, evolving comix maestro and classical guitarist. Brannigan and McCabe met through a mutual friend and played gigs in Christchurch and Dunedin under many names including The Whining Plums, Hey, We're Wolves and The Twins in the early '80s. It was at a Twins gig at the notorious Empire Tavern in Dunedin in 1983 where Stu Kawowski was first unable to control himself and leapt on stage to commandeer the bongos, instantly adding another dimension to the unit. Art School Photography graduate, photography guru, filmmaker, artist, promotional maverick and explosives expert Kawowski was playing drums with Above Ground, Bill Direen's band at the time he met the other members of the Axemen and soon 'joined' the Axemen as a permanent fixture. Brannigan, McCabe and Kawowski remained the 'core' of the Axemen in the 20th century, however many New Zealand musicians played with them over the years as guest / transient / semi-permanent members, making their influence and the influences they assimilated (like the borg) an important breeding ground and virtual swap-meet of ideas and influence in Kiwi music circles. In February 2009, US record label Siltbreeze re-released the Axemen's 1984 protest album :Big Cheap Motel\\" on 12\\" vinyl. Originally the album was released as a cassette packaged in a small bubble-sleeve with a straw, mimicking the milk drink \\"Big M\\" that the album was aimed at. The Axemen were invited to play at Christchurch's \\"Summertimes\\" Festival in January 1984, a public music stage set up in Hagley Park, Christchurch. The band was shocked by the large-scale sexist \\"Big M\\" advertising surrounding the main stage, and decided to write a suite of protest songs about how the Christchurch City Council had \\"sold out\\" to the \\"Big M\\" sexist marketing. The Axemen recorded the concert, as well as studio versions of their songs and released a 45 min cassette entitled, \\"Big Cheap Motel\\".Collett, H. (1984). p. 34, \\"Adverts inspire Axemen\\", The New Zealand Times. 4 November 1984 Siltbreeze later the same year re-released 'Scary! pt III', an experimental album featuring small-form collaborations with sublime Chch artist Lissa Bruce, and multiple band incarnations from the late 1980s and early 1990s. A four piece Axemen (McCabe, Brannigan, Kawowski & Stojanovic) toured the United States for five weeks in October and November 2009, opening for Times New Viking Starting out on the West Coast in Sacramento 27 October, travelling down the West Coast, across the South, up the east to New York then heading west and ending in Chicago on 28 November. The band played 26 shows and covered approx 7,000 miles on the tour. The Axemen's debut 2xLP \\"Three Virgins :: Three Versions :: Three Visions\\" was re- issued and released on 7 June 2011 by Siltbreeze. This album was originally released on New Zealand label Flying Nun Records in 1985. The first pressing was 667 copies made at the now closed EMI pressing plant in Lower Hutt, NZ. A mint copy of the 1985 vinyl was \\"needle drop\\" transferred to digital files at Shadoks Music Studio, Amrum, Germany. Then it was mastered at Fir International, Zaandam, Netherlands, and lacquers cut at Prairie Cat Mastering, Belvidere, Illinois, U.S. The vinyl was pressed at Record Technology Inc., in Camarillo, California, U.S. A four-piece AXEMEN incarnation featuring McCabe, Kawowski, Stojanovic and newcomer William Daymond toured Australia in December 2011, a new line up that added William Daymond on bass guitar, allowing Dragan Stojanovic to resume his lead guitar duties. Bob Brannigan declined an invitation to join the band on this tour, due to irreconcilable differences with Steve McCabe. Originally the band were to headline a festival in Wandella, South New South Wales, but due to bureaucratic red tape, this festival was cancelled. The organiser Samuel Miers then proceeded to book the Axemen into 10 dates starting at Brisbane, and ending in Adelaide on 23 December. Midway during the Australian tour Steve McCabe's shoulder was fractured after he was attacked by a wild Australian punter. In 2012, the Axemen headlined a Christchurch 1980s reunion concert at the Dux Live venue in Christchurch, and also did a mid-winter pair of shows at Mighty Mighty in Wellington 22 June, and Wunderbar Lyttleton on 23 June. The 'Class of 2011' Axemen (McCabe, Kawowski, Stojanovic, Daymond) recorded a new vinyl album Sac Tap Nut Jam in Wellington in 2013, which was released through Spacecase Records, California. 2014 saw the re-release of 1989's Derry Legend on vinyl by Luxury Products USA after 100% analogue re-mastering by Angus McNaughton of Auralax Mastering in Auckland. The re-release package contained a newsprint poster and single sheet fold-out newsprint collection of media reviews and photos from the Axemen archives. The re-issue was also available as an audio CD, and as a compact cassette.

The countries have signed various agreements on bilateral cooperation. Historical relations Ilkhanate at its greatest extent c.1330 AD The Silk Road connected the ancient civilizations of Egypt and China, passing through Mongolia. Silk may have been brought to Egypt through this route as early as 3,000 years ago. The Mongol Empire, founded by Genghis Khan (c. 1162‚Äì1227 AD) had established unified political authority through the length of the Silk Road from Beijing to Baghdad by 1258. Following the capture of Baghdad by Hulagu Khan, the Mongols advanced into Syria and Palestine. With Hulagu's main forces occupied elsewhere, a relatively small Mongol-led army was defeated by an Egyptian Mamluk army in the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. The clash has been described as one of the most significant battles of world history, checking the further expansion of the Mongol Empire towards the southwest and profoundly influencing the future course of Arab and European history. Bahri Mamluks empire at its greatest extent. Blue indicates the Ilkhanates. Led by the victor of 'Ain Jalut, Sultan Baibars, the Egyptian forces conducted an aggressive policy towards the Mongols, advancing through the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia to attack and defeat the Mongol-dominated Sultanate of R√ªm in the Battle of Elbistan (1277 AD). Sporadic warfare continued. The Mamluks were victorious in the Second Battle of Hims (1281) against the armies of Abaqa Khan. The Mongols defeated the Mamluks in 1299 in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, and the Mamluks regained the ascendancy at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar in 1303. It was not until 1323 that the two sides signed a peace treaty.

Timurid Empire c. 1402 AD In 1401 a fresh Mongol threat appeared in the person of Timurlane, who invaded Syria (then part of the Mamluk Sultanate) with a huge army and sacked Aleppo and Damascus, slaughtering the inhabitants. The Mamluks fought back but were forced to retire to Egypt, and only avoided defeat when Timur moved east in preparation for an attack on China, dying in 1405 before he could return to complete his conquest of the Middle East. This was the last time Egypt was threatened by the Mongols. After Egypt was absorbed by the Ottoman Empire in 1517, it did not regain full independence until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser. It was during Nasser's presidency of Egypt that formal relations between the modern states of Egypt and Mongolia were established in 1964. Recent official visits and agreements * In June 2001, a Mongolian parliamentary delegation visited Egypt, and met with the president of the National Assembly of Egypt. The group signed a cooperation agreement with Egypt, and agreed to increase the number of Mongolian students attending courses in Egypt. * In December 2003, the Foreign Minister of Egypt met his Mongolian counterpart. * Mongolian President Natsagiin Bagabandi paid an official visit to Egypt in April 2004 where he met with President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak. The two leaders discussed problems in Palestine and Iraq, and also discussed ways to enhance bilateral relations. Later in the visit, the two countries signed an executive protocol for cultural cooperation and agreements on air services, economic cooperation and investments protection. * In 2005, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit visited Mongolia, during which he began the planning of mutual visits of the ministers of finance of the two countries. * In March 2007, the Egyptian Minister of International Cooperation visited Ulan Bator where he met Mongolian Prime Minister Miyeegombyn Enkhbold. * In October 2008 the Secretary General of the Egyptian Fund for Technical Cooperation with the Commonwealth visited Ulaanbaatar where he met with ministers and discussed enhanced cooperation between Egypt and Mongolia. The Mongolian officials said they welcomed the technical support provided by the fund in training and other economic benefits. Security cooperation In 2001, Mongolia sent policemen to Egypt to attend trainings sessions on anti-terrorism and the prevention of drug trafficking. In 2008, Mongolian officials visited Egypt to obtain information on the role of anti- corruption officials.

Life Born at Imola, Bianchi graduated in electrical mechanical engineering at the University of Turin in 1912. Offered a job by Ferrovie dello Stato, the operator of the Italian rail network, he was first assigned to the select committee for the electrification of Rome. In 1920 Bianchi was transferred to the office for locomotive research within the Servizio materiale e trazione (Rolling Stock and Locomotive Service) at Florence (where it still resides, under a different name). Although Bianchi distinguished himself through projects involving steam locomotives for mainline services (like the three variations of the planned Class 695 for Ferrovie dello Stato, as well as the Class 691 obtained by rebuilding the Class 690), his work was central to the transition from steam to electric power. As the limitations of using three phase alternating current electrification became evident, and after examining the possibilities offered by direct current of 3 kV (as did some railways in the United States), Bianchi concentrated on this system of electrification. Already during the first part of his career he had contributed to improve electric locomotives run on three- phase alternating current (3.6 kV, 16.7 Hz), and subsequently directed the planning of new locomotive types, the E432 (FS) and E554. His office also directed the development of the E326, E626, E428, and E424. The E424 was not built; but Bianchi's successor built this class of the same name starting in 1943 based on the class E636). Mainstream historiography holds that the change of the heads of the Railroads of the State after Fascism's partial takeover of power may have contributed to defeating internal resistance within Ferrovie dello Stato to using direct current. Nevertheless, Bianchi refused to subscribe to the fascist party, and was always troublesome if not explicitly opposed to the regime. The initial failure of his attempts to reach high speeds with his locomotives and with the electric trains ETR 200 allowed his political and industrial opponents to get him dismissed from the assignment in 1937. He was transferred to Ferrovie Nord Milano, where he ran the complete electrification of the network and stayed on until retirement, except for a brief stint working again with the FS, from 1945 to 1946. Works An E626 locomotive. Bianchi proposed the creation of four different roles for locomotives in order to specialize maintenance services more than had previously been possible. This strategy of specialization was not entirely new, but at that time the depot-system was very heterogeneous: inherited from the different railroad administrations left over after the 1905 birth of the national railway system, it had many different engines carrying out the same task, making management and maintenance burdensome. The four roles Bianchi proposed were: * Locomotive for swift trains. He designated the E326 for this task, which later proved ill-suited for these high speeds. * Locomotive for heavy trains, for which he designated the E428. * Locomotive \\"multiruolo\\" (multi-role), assigned to the E626. * Locomotive for light trains, except for powerful and costly high-altitude routes. He saw only the (predecessor of the 1943) E424 as suitable. Bianchi fully understood the necessity of a high standard of service and maintenance for the railcars under his jurisdiction, which were then still highly prone to mechanical breakdowns due to the newness of the technologies used. To meet this requirement, in 1928 he introduced the theory of 'Interoperabilit√†' (interoperability): all the technical components of the locomotives should be simplified in their planning-stages (in favor of reliability) and of a single standardized design to make finding spare parts easier. These guidelines represented a philosophy whose concept was very close to that of the 1950s, spread amongst industry in general under the names \\"Design for maintenance\\" and \\"Reliable system design\\". These design choices were carried over to the characteristic \\"Bianchi Line\\" inspired by the locomotives and systems already used in Switzerland. His locomotives were composed of a heavy rigid chassis, a central box and two small projections, one for each side. These projections, though reduced, they continued to characterize new Italian engines until the introduction of the E424, in service until the 1990s. They also influenced the development of the E636, which were built from 1940 to 1962 and were one of the most numerous Italian locomotive groups, not decommissioned until 2006.

It is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas. Kalighat was a Ghat (landing stage) sacred to Kali on the old course (Adi Ganga) of the Hooghly river (BhƒÅgirathi) in the city of Kolkata. The name Calcutta is said to have been derived from the word Kalighat. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga which connects to the Hooghly. The Adi Ganga was the original course of the river Hooghly. Hence the name Adi (original) Ganga.  Legend  Kalighat is regarded as one of the 51 Shakti Peethas of India, where the various parts of Sati's body are said to have fallen, in the course of Shiva's Rudra Tandava. Kalighat represents the site where the toes of the right foot of Dakshayani or Sati fell. Kalighat is also associated with the worship offered to Kali by a Dasanami Monk by name Chowranga Giri, and the Chowringee area of Calcutta is said to have been named after him. History 'Kalighat Kali Temple, 1887 The Kalighat temple in its present form is only about 200 years old, although it has been referred to in Mansar Bhasan composed in the 15th century, and in Kavi Kankan Chandi of the 17th century. The present structure of the temple was completed under the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family's patronage in 1809. Mention of the Kali temple is also found in Lalmohon Bidyanidhis's 'Sambanda Nirnoy\\".Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication. Only two types of coins of Chandragupta II, who incorporated Vanga in the Gupta Empire, are known from Bengal. His Archer type coins, which became the most popular type of coinage with the Gupta rulers after Kumaragupta I, have been found in Kalighat. This is evidence of the antiquity of the place. The Kalighat Kali idol. The image of Kali in this temple is unique. It does not follow the pattern of other Kali images in Bengal. The present idol of touchstone was created by two saints - Atmaram Brahmachari and Brahmananda Giri. Presently, the three huge eyes, long protruding tongue made of gold and four hands, which all are made of gold too. Two of these hands holding a scimitar and a severed head of the asura king 'Shumbha'. The scimitar signifies Divine Knowledge and the asura (or, human) head signifies human Ego which must be slain by Divine Knowledge in order to attain Moksha. The other two hands are in the abhaya and varada mudras or blessings, which means her initiated devotees (or anyone worshiping her with a true heart) will be saved as she will guide them here and hereafter. Temple details =Shoshti Tala= Shoshti Tala This is a rectangular altar about three feet high bearing a small cactus plant. Beneath the tree, on an altar three stones are placed side by side - left to right representing the goddesses Shashthi (Shoshti), Shitala and Mangal Chandi. This sacred spot is known as Shoshti Tala or Monosha Tala. This altar was constructed by Gobinda Das Mondal in 1880. The place of the altar is the Samadhi of Brahmananda Giri. Here all the priests are female. No daily worship or offering of Bhog (food offering) is done here. The goddesses here are considered as part of Kali. =Natmandir= A large rectangular covered platform called Natmandir has been erected adjacent to the main temple, from where the face of the image can be seen. This was originally built by Zamindar Kasinath Roy in 1835. It has been subsequently renovated often. =Jor Bangla= The temple's bathing ghat, 1947. The spacious verandah of the main temple facing the image is known as Jor Bangla. Rituals occurring inside the sanctum sanctorum are visible from the Natmandir through the Jor Bangla. =Harkath Tala= This is the spot adjacent to the Natmandir, southwards meant for Bali (sacrifice). There are two Sacrificial altars for animal sacrifices side by side. These are known as Hari- Kath. =Radha-Krishna Temple= This temple is known as Shyama-raya temple and is situated inside the temple at the west side of the main temple. In 1723, a settlement officer of Murshidabad district first erected a separate temple for Radha-Krishna. In 1843 a Zamindar called Udoy Narayan Mondal erected the present temple in the same spot. The Dolmancha was founded in 1858 by Madan Koley of Saha Nagar. There is a separate kitchen for preparation of vegetarian Bhog (food offering) for Radha-Krishna. =Kundupukur= Kalighat Temple Tank (Kundupukur) This is the sacred tank situated in the south-east of the temple outside the boundary walls. Present area of the tank is approximately 10 cottahs. In the past it was bigger and called 'Kaku-Kunda'. The 'Sati-Anga' (the right toe of Sati) was discovered from this tank. It is believed that taking a dip in this small pond/ tank can bestow one with the boon of a child. The water from this tank is regarded as sacred as that of the Ganges. There had been futile efforts in the past of draining the water from the tank for cleaning, which creates a strong possibility of a subterranean link with the Adi Ganga. The Kalighat Temple as a Shakti Peeth The Temple at Kalighat is revered as an important Shakti Peetha, by the Shaktism sect of Hinduism. The mythology of Daksha yajna and Sati's self immolation is the story behind the origin of Shakti Peethas. Daksha, the son of Brahma was an ancient entity called Prajapati or the keeper of the beings in Hinduism. He had a lot of daughters, one of whom was Sati, an incarnation of the Primordial Mother Goddess or Shakti. She was married to Shiva, the ascetic, whose abode was in the cold and snowy recesses of the Kailasa Parvat. Daksha had frowned upon the marriage, as Shiva was a penniless man, quite unlike the King that Daksha was. In time, Daksha decided that he would arrange a yajna or a ritual where he would invite all the gods, except for Shiva. Sati, his daughter came to her father's place, uninvited and faced a flurry of insults from her father about her husband. Unable to bear the insults, she immolated herself. The news of the death of his beloved wife set Shiva on a delirious rage, as he started the Tandav or the Dance of Destruction with the body of Sati, calming down, only when Vishnu managed to chop her body down into fifty one pieces, which would fall all over the length and breadth of India. (A lot of these places are in modern day Pakistan and Bangladesh as well.) Shakti Peethas or divine seats of Shakti or the Primordial Mother Goddess, thus came into being wherever these severed parts of Sati's body had fallen. Each of the 51 Peethas have a temple dedicated to the Shakti or the Primordial Mother, and a temple dedicated to the Bhairava or Shiva, the All-Father, essentially forming important historical centres to mark the marriage of Shaivism and Shaktism, and also the philosophical fact that a man is nothing without his Shakti or Woman and vice versa. The Shakti here is thus Dakshina Kali (the benevolent Mother of the World) while the Bhairav being Nakulish or Nakuleshwar. It is believed that the right big toe of Sati fell here at Kalighat. However, some Puranas also mention that the Mukha Khanda (face) of the Goddess fell here, got fossilized, and is stored and worshipped here. The 51 Shakti Peethas are linked to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit, each carrying the power to invoke one of the goddesses associated with them. These Alphabets are called Beeja Mantras or the seeds of the primordial sounds of creation. The Beeja Mantra for Dakshina Kali is Krƒ´m. The mythological texts which include the Kalika Purana (Ashtashakti,) recognize the four major Shakti Peethas‚ÄîBimala where resides the Pada Khanda (feet) (the temple is inside the Jagannath Temple, Puri, Odisha), Tara Tarini housing the Stana Khanda (Breasts), (near Brahmapur, Odisha), Kamakshya, Yoni khanda (vagina) (near Guwahati, Assam) and Dakshina Kalika, Mukha khanda (in Kolkata, West Bengal) originated from the lifeless body of the goddess Sati. This is illustrated in a hymn from the Kalika Purana (Ashtashakti): ‚ÄúVimala Pada khandancha, Stana khandancha Tarini (Tara Tarini), Kamakhya Yoni khandancha, Mukha khandancha Kalika (Kali) Anga pratyanga sangena Vishnu Chakra Kshate nacha‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Further explaining the importance of these four Peethas the Brihat Samhita gives the geographical location of these Peethas. For example: ‚ÄúRushikulya Tate Devi, Tarakashya Mahagiri, Tashya Srunge Stitha Tara, Vasishta Rajitapara\\" Thus, there is no dispute regarding these four Adi Shakti Peethas and their locations. These four Peethas are also believed as the most powerful Shakti Peethas in Bharata Varsha. However, all these Four Adi Shakti Peethas are also part of 51 Shakti Peethas but there are four major parts of Devi Sati's body So, they are important, powerful and believed as Adi Shakti Peethas. Associated Temples =Nakuleshwar Bhairav Temple= Nakuleshwar Bhairav Temple This Bhairav temple is dedicated to the consort of Dakshina Kali.

FNM operates also the Brescia-Edolo railway in eastern Lombardy, not shown in map. Ferrovie Nord Milano (FNM S.p.A.) is an Italian public transport company: the second largest railway company in Italy. It operates primarily in the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Piedmont and in Canton Ticino in southern Switzerland. Listed on the Borsa Italiana, its main shareholders are the Lombardy Region (57.57%), Ferrovie dello Stato (14.5%) and Aurelia S.p.A. (3%). History The company was founded as Societ√† Anonima Ferrovie Milano-Saronno e Milano-Erba in 1877 by the Belgian Albert Vaucamps. The Milan-Saronno railroad was inaugurated on March 22, 1879, while the Milan-Erba was opened later in December of the same year. In 1883 the company was rechristened Societ√† Anonima per le Ferrovie Nord Milano (FNM). Five years later the consortium was joined by Societ√† per le Ferrovie del Ticino, who held the Como-Malnate-Varese-Laveno and Saronno- Malnate lines. Until the end of the century FNM also acquired the lines Novara-Seregno and Saronno-Grandate, forming a large network in northern Lombardy in direct competition with the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate del Mediterraneo. When railways were nationalized in Italy, in 1907, Mediterranea acquired the shares of the Belgian owners. Electrification of most lines began in 1929, and was completed in 1953. In 1958 passenger service was discontinued on the Saronno-Seregno line, while the Malnate-Grandate line was closed in 1966. In 1974 FNM, a joint stock company starting from 1943, was entirely acquired by the Lombardy regional government. Two different companies, Ferrovie Nord Milano Esercizio and Ferrovie Nord Milano Autotrasporti, were created in 1985 with responsibilities for rail and road transport respectively. In 2004 the former was again split into two companies, Ferrovie Nord Cargo (for cargo services) and Ferrovie Nord Milano Trasporti (for the passenger one). In 2006 a new logo and new identities for three companies were adopted: Ferrovie Nord Milano Trasporti S.r.l. became LeNord S.r.l., Ferrovie Nord Milano Esercizio S.p.A. became FERROVIENORD S.p.A. and Ferrovie Nord Cargo S.r.l. became NordCargo S.r.l.. The whole group name became FNM S.p.A..

William served an apprenticeship with him after attending St. Paul's School, London, and Tonbridge School, where his nickname was \\"Memory Woodfall\\". Following his father's retirement, Woodfall shared the running of the Public Advertiser with his brother Henry Sampson Woodfall. In 1769 William Woodfall founded the Morning Chronicle as publisher, editor, and reporter. In 1789 he sold his interest in the Morning Chronicle and founded The Diary, or Woodfall's Register, which pioneered the full reporting of Parliamentary debates. Because of the ban on note-taking in the House of Commons, he had memorised what was said, writing it down afterwards. The Diary was published from 30 March 1789 to 31 August 1793.The Eighteenth-Century Periodical and the Theatre: 1715‚Äì1803, Auburn University Under the name \\"Adams\\", Woodfall acted on the stage in Scotland. His son Thomas, a publisher and printer of theatre bills, married the actress Clementina Collins in 1796. William Woodfall's reporting was frequently controversial. Edmund Burke sued him for libel and, in 1779, Woodfall was found guilty of printing and publishing a leaflet supporting the acquittal of Admiral Augustus Keppell.

She was taken to New York, and placed out of commission on 13 April for conversion by Bethlehem Steel, 56th Street Yard, Brooklyn, New York. The ship was placed in full commission on 30 October 1944, with Commander D. G. Greenlee in command. Operational history On 3 December 1944 Burleigh departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, and proceeded to the Pacific, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 23 December. She became flagship of Transport Squadron 18 at San Francisco on 3 January 1945. During January and February, Burleigh transported passengers and supplies to Pearl Harbor, Guadalcanal, and the Russell Islands. =Okinawa= March 1945 was spent at Ulithi, Caroline Islands, in preparation for the assault on Okinawa. Burleigh departed Ulithi, in company with Transport Squadron 18, on 27 March, and arrived off Okinawa on 1 April. She remained in the area disembarking Marines and supplies until 10 April, when she got underway for Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 April, after stopping at Guam to embark casualties. Returning to San Francisco on 4 June, Burleigh embarked troops and supplies and steamed to Guam via Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Saipan. She returned to San Francisco on 2 August. =Operation Magic Carpet= With the cessation of hostilities, Burleigh was assigned to the Operation Magic Carpet fleet returning veterans from the Pacific until March 1946.

Chambers was the eldest son of William Chambers, a political servant of the East India Company, and a distinguished oriental scholar, who died in 1793, by his marriage with Charity, daughter of Thomas Fraser, of Balmain, Inverness-shire. Sir Robert Chambers (1737‚Äì1803) was his uncle. He was born in India in 1786, came to England in 1793, was educated at Bath grammar school and at Westminster School; from which he was elected to a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA (1808), MA (1811) and MD (1818). On leaving Cambridge he studied medicine at St. George's Hospital, the Windmill Street School of Medicine, and in Edinburgh. He was an inceptor candidate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, 22 December 1813, a candidate 30 September 1818, a fellow 30 September 1819, censor (police of the Royal College of Physicians) 1822 and 1836, consiliarius 1836, 1841, and 1845, and an elect in 1847. On 20 April 1816 he was elected physician at St. George's Hospital, though the youngest of the candidates, and held the post until 1839; during that period he delivered a course of lectures on practical medicine, a report of which was printed in the Medical Gazette. For some time his private practice did not increase, and in 1820 his receipts were only about ¬£200; however, after that year a change took place, until at last he attained that standing in the profession in which a physician monopolises the greater part of the consulting practice among the upper classes. He was gazetted physician in ordinary to Queen Adelaide 25 October 1836, and physician in ordinary to William IV on 4 May 1837. Ernest, the new king of Hanover, on 8 August 1837 created him KCH; but at his urgent request allowed him to decline the assumption of the ordinary prefix of knighthood. In the succeeding reign he became physician in ordinary to Queen Victoria on 8 August 1837, and to the Duchess of Kent in 1839. He continued to be the leading physician in London, with an income of from seven to nine thousand guineas a year, until 1848, when bad health obliged him to retire into private life. Shortly after he had given up the practice of his profession a notice of his death appeared in a medical journal, and was contradicted by himself. In 1834 a poisoned wound, obtained in a post-mortem examination, had nearly cost him his life, and from its effects he never fully recovered. On his retirement he took up his residence on his estate at Hordlecliffe, near Lymington, Hampshire, where he died of paralysis on 16 December 1855. His success in practice depended mainly on the clear insight which he gained into all the bearings of a case by habituating himself to place all the facts before him in the order of their importance, with reference to present symptoms and immediate treatment required. His constant habit of taking notes of cases coming before him gave his mind a compactness and clearness in summing up facts which was the parent of practical views in theory and successful decision in action. On 13 March 1828 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. His only contribution to literature was a series of papers on cholera, printed in The Lancet on 10 and 17 February and 3 March 1849. He married, 10 February 1821, Mary, daughter of William Mackinen Fraser, MD, of Lower Grosvenor Street, London. His manuscripts of cases in St. George's Hospital, 1814‚Äì28, in ten volumes folio, were in the library of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. His note-taking of cases was considered to be particularly thorough.

In the import and export of services, it refers to the creation, establishment, and management of contracts in a foreign country.  Factors affecting viability of entry  Many companies can successfully operate in a niche market without ever expanding into new markets. On the other hand, some businesses can only achieve increased sales, brand awareness and business stability if they enter a new market. Developing a market-entry strategy involves thorough analysis of potential competitors and possible customers. Relevant factors that must be considered when deciding the viability of entry into a particular market include trade barriers, localized knowledge, price localization, competition, and export subsidies.  Timing of market entry  Lymbersky has said that \\"What countries to enter and when mainly depends on the financial resources of a company, the product life- cycle and the product itself.\\" Lymbersky, C.: (2008) \\"Market Entry Strategies\\", p. 364; Management Laboratory Press, Hamburg The different strategies available are: *Waterfall model *Wave strategy *Sprinkler strategy  Strategies  Some of the most common market entry strategies are: directly by setup of an entity in the market, directly exporting products, indirectly exporting using a reseller, distributor, or sales outsourcing, and producing products in the target market.Corporate documents, Chapter 7: Market Entry strategies Others include: *Licensing *Greenfield project *Franchising *Business alliance * Exporting-(Direct/Ind) * Turnkey project * Joint ventures * Outsourcing See also Permanent establishment risk  Market entry and trade risks  Some of the risks incurred when entering a new market and start domestic or international trade include: *Weather risk *Systematic risk, different from systemic risk, the systematic risk is the risk inherent to the entire market or an entire market segment *Sovereign risk *Foreign exchange risk *Liquidity risk *Cultural risk While some companies prefer to develop their own their market entry plans, other outsource to specialised companies. The knowledge of the local or target market by those specialized companies can mitigate trade risk. Other market entry strategies include: *Production at home Indirect exporting (export merchant) Direct exporting (foreign customer, agent, distributor, representative office, foreign branch, foreign subsidiary) *Production abroad without direct investment (management contract, franchising, licensing, contract manufacturing) with direct investment (partly owned subsidiary, acquisition of a foreign company, set up a new company, equity joint venture) Sources *Reviving Traditions in Research on International Market Entry, Po Li (Auteur), T.

The patient breathes in nebulized methacholine or histamine. Thus the test may also be called a methacholine challenge test or histamine challenge test respectively. Both drugs provoke bronchoconstriction, or narrowing of the airways. Whereas histamine causes nasal and bronchial mucus secretion and bronchoconstriction via the H1 receptor, methacholine utilizes the M3 receptor for bronchoconstriction. The degree of narrowing can then be quantified by spirometry. People with pre-existing airway hyperreactivity, such as asthmatics, will react to lower doses of drug. Sometimes, to assess the reversibility of a particular condition, a bronchodilator is administered to counteract the effects of the bronchoconstrictor before repeating the spirometry tests. This is commonly referred to as a reversibility test, or a post bronchodilator test (post BD), and may help in distinguishing asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Also, a DLCO test can be used to distinguish asthma (normal to high DLCO) from COPD (reduced DLCO). False positives and negatives are possible in the bronchial challenge test. In addition, asthma may be temporary due to an exposure to noxious stimuli or exercise. The bronchial challenge test is physically demanding, and the results can be affected by muscular weakness or exhaustion. The inhaled drug can stimulate the upper airway sufficiently to cause violent coughing. This can make spirometry difficult or impossible. This test is contraindicated in patients with severe airway obstruction due to the obvious worsening of the obstruction. Also contraindicated by the presence of an aortic aneurysm, as spirometry will increase blood pressure, in proportion to both the patient's effort and the degree of obstruction in the lungs.

Collins (10 May 1893 ‚Äì ?), also known as Frank Collins, was an Irish footballer who briefly played as goalkeeper for Celtic during the 1920s. Collins was a dual internationalist and played for both Ireland teams ‚Äì the IFA XI and the FAI XI. He was born in Dublin, Ireland. Club career Collins first came to prominence while playing junior football with Jacobs and was subsequently spotted by Celtic while playing for Ireland Juniors. In May 1921 he joined Celtic in time for an end-of-season match in Paris against Cercle Athl√©tique. The following season Collins provided cover for regular goalkeeper Charlie Shaw, making his Scottish League debut in a 4‚Äì0 win against Dumbarton on 6 September 1921. At the end of the season however, Celtic made Collins available for transfer, and he returned to Jacobs to play in the newly formed League of Ireland. While with Jacobs, Collins also represented the League of Ireland XI. He remained with the Dublin club until they left the League of Ireland in 1932. Irish international When Collins began his international career in 1922, Ireland was represented by a single team, selected by the Belfast-based Irish Football Association. However, during the 1920s, Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. Amid these political upheavals, a rival association, the Football Association of Ireland, emerged in Dublin and from 1924 organised their own national team. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including Collins played for both teams ‚Äì the IFA XI and the FAI XI. =IFA XI= Collins represented the IFA XI at both junior and senior levels. On 12 March 1921, while still playing for Jacobs, he played for the first IFA junior team to beat Scotland Juniors at home. The Boys In Green ‚Äì The FAI International Story (1997): Sean Ryan He kept a clean-sheet in a 1‚Äì0 win at Celtic Park and impressed the host club. Collins made his one and only appearance for the senior IFA XI while playing for Celtic. Despite his lack of first-team action, Collins was selected for the match on 4 March 1922 with Scotland. This time, however, the IFA XI lost 2‚Äì1 in a game also played at Celtic Park. His teammates that day included, among others, Mick O'Brien and Bill Lacey.Scotland results at Rsssf =FAI XI= After returning to Jacobs, Collins also played twice for the FAI XI. On 14 June 1924 he kept goal against the United States in 3‚Äì1 win at Dalymount Park. His teammates that day included, among others, Ed Brookes, Paddy Duncan, Tommy Muldoon, Charlie Dowdall and Johnny Murray.United States results at Rsssf Collins had to wait nearly four years before making his second appearance for the FAI XI. On 23 April 1927 he played against Italy B at Lansdowne Road. His teammates that day included Mick O'Brien and Bill Lacey, both of whom had previously played with him for the IFA XI. The FAI XI lost the friendly 2‚Äì1 and Collins was blamed for conceding a soft second goal, allowing a poorly hit shot from 20 yards to slip under his body. However, a colleague later claimed that a war wound, which meant Collins was slow to get down on his right side, may have been to blame.

The neighborhood which developed around the railway station is located about eight kilometers from the center of Jokioinen and about eight kilometers from Humppila. The station building of Minki√∂ (Mi√∂) was built in 1898 when the Jokioinen Railway was constructed. The name of the station has always been Minki√∂, even the actual village of Minki√∂ is located about south of the station, near the present day Jokioinen station of the Jokioinen Museum Railway. Locals called the station \\"Kiipu platform\\" (Kiipun laituri). The station had daily passenger service in 1899‚Äì1951. However the ticket sales was only started in the mid 1930s. In addition to the 1898 built and 1903 expanded station building (), also a sauna and baking hut (), shed and cattle shelter () and a goods shed () remain at the station area today. Originally Minki√∂ was rated as a platform point and later on a station stop. The station was never an independent station and was always under control of a Jokioinen station master. The station was changed to unmanned on 1 December 1962. The station building saw random usage for ten years. In 1972 the Museum Railway Forssa - Humppila (Museorautatie Forssa - Humppila ry) rented the station when the museum train traffic was started. The goods shed remained in the use of Jokioinen Railway. In 1978 both buildings were bought by the Jokioinen Museum Railway together with other buildings of the station area. At its largest the Minki√∂ yard had three tracks. The third track was built for goods loading in 1933 and was dismantled in 1966. Jokioinen Museum Railway When the railway line from Minki√∂ to Jokioinen was bought from Jokioinen Railway the development of the museum's own Minki√∂ station started. A small countryside station grew to be the central depot of the museum railway. The railway yard has grown from two to fifteen tracks.

Her first travelogue, Rambles in the South of Ireland, was published in 1839. Life Henrietta Georgiana Marcia Lascelles Iremonger was born at 24 Arlington Street, Piccadilly, London, on 11 November 1806, the only child of the Rev. Lascelles Iremonger (died 6 January 1830), a prebendary of Winchester Cathedral, and his second wife, the former Harriett Gambier, youngest sister of Admiral Lord James Gambier. Her mother's family had been acquainted with Samuel Johnson, William Wilberforce, Madame de Sta√´l, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Hannah More, among other public figures, who visited their seat at Barham Court.\\"MEMOIRS OF GEORGIANA, LADY CHATTERTON.\\" The Catholic World, A Monthly Magazine of General Literature and Science (1865-1906), vol. 28, no. 164, 11, 1878, pp. 145.

They more commonly stayed with her Uncle William Pitt Morgan and Aunt Margaret, who often had lunch with King George III. On 3 August 1824, Georgiana was presented before the Court to the King and Queen in a formal ceremony. At her debutante's ball, she met Sir William Abraham Chatterton, 2nd Baronet of Castle Mahon, County Cork, who was 18 years her senior. She married him aged 17 on 3 August 1824 at St George's Hanover Square Church.London Metropolitan Archives; London, England; Reference Number: DL/T/089/019. Ancestry.com.

They spent their early married years at his home in Castle Mahon, Cork, Ireland, and in Winchester with Georgiana's parents. While living in County Cork, Georgiana's poor health caused her to move to Florence, Italy, a city which at the time was expanding with cultural and social diversity and ideas. This increased her interest in writing novels. She spent several subsequent winters abroad. After her father's death, the couple moved to Seamore Place in Mayfair where they were known for their wealth and were regular guests of King William IV. Georgiana often visited Princess Victoria at Tunbridge Wells. There she wrote her first work of fiction, entitled Aunt Dorothy's Tales, and published it anonymously. Soon after, in 1839, she published a second novel, Rambles in South Ireland, which was well received, selling out within weeks. She would continue writing novels every two years, while keeping up a thriving social life with London's literary intelligentsia. In 1845‚Äì1851, the Great Irish Famine deprived her husband of his rents and forced them to move back to England and stay in Rolls Park in Essex until 5 August 1855, when Sir William Chatterton died. After two years of grieving, Georgiana and Rebecca Orpen, Sir William's niece, who was in her care, decided to resume regularly attending parties and social gatherings. Soon after, Georgiana met a fellow novelist, Edward Heneage Dering, (born 1827, youngest son of John Dering, rector of Pluckley, Kent, and prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral). Edward's intention was to marry Rebecca, but due to poor hearing Lady Chatterton assumed the proposal was made to her. On 1 June 1859, the widow married Dering and they took up residence in 1869 with Rebecca and her husband Marmion, the last old squire of Baddesley Clinton Hall, Warwickshire. There Marmion and Dering took to wearing 17th-century costume. Within six years of their marriage, Dering was received into the Roman Catholic Church. Georgiana herself wavered, but after a correspondence with William Bernard Ullathorne, Roman Catholic Bishop of Birmingham, she converted as well in August 1875. Her husband stated that she lived by three principles during her lifetime: to know the will of God and do it; to see everything exactly how it was, without reference to her own wishes; and never to turn aside from a difficulty, however easily avoided. Georgiana Dering died at Baddesley Clinton Hall on 6 February 1876, aged 69. She was a successful author, and died extremely wealthy, leaving an estate valued at just under ¬£40,000. She was buried at the Catholic Church of St Francis of Assisi, where Edward Dering, Rebecca Ferrers and her husband Marmion would later be buried as well. Writings Lady Chatterton's first book, Aunt Dorothy's Tales (1837), was published anonymously in two volumes. Two years later came Rambles in the South of Ireland, whose first edition sold out in weeks. Many other tales, novels, poems and travel accounts followed, under the name Georgiana Chatterton. Despite the extreme success of her first two novels, Georgiana would often remark that her books never made \\"a hit\\".\\"MEMOIRS OF GEORGIANA, LADY CHATTERTON.\\" The Catholic World, A Monthly Magazine of General Literature and Science (1865-1906), vol. 28, no. 164, 11, 1878, pp. 28 and 145. In her novel Allanson, or The Infidel (1843), she explains how she feared she might appear a different person to others than she really was: \\"Most of us try to be blind to our own inconsistencies, and this, perhaps, makes us less aware of the inconsistency of others\\".\\"Memoirs of Georgiana, Lady Chatterton (1878, p. 11). The Catholic World, A Monthly Magazine of General Literature and Science (1865‚Äì1906), No. 28, p. 145. Retrieved from . Later, she noted how there were good men that would not commit a bad act even when tempted and bad men who would never do a good act when tempted. While writing this book, Lady Chatterton kept up a self-enforced solitude. Chatterton's poem \\"Leonore\\" (1864) indicated her kindness to others. Her behaviour towards strangers and friends is described in her writings: \\"The most agreeable persons are certainly those who have the greatest faith in the goodness of others. By appealing to the best feelings of those with whom we converse, by giving them credit for good qualities... [we bring] these good feelings into play.\\" Lady Chatterton, in Spain and the Pyrenees, wrote of her adventures and travels around the world, making observations and telling stories. One such is a disagreement with the Pope, in a short story that explains how marriage is banned on pain of excommunication. Cardinal John Henry Newman praised her refinement of thought in her later fiction. More recently, however, her work has been described as banal and called \\"uniformly unmemorable\\".ODNB entry on Chatterton, Lady Henrietta Georgiana Marcia Lascelles. ; retrieved 13 November 2012 (Pay-walled) Legacy: sketches found 275x275px In 2015, an archivist from the Dering collection at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust found a sketch in one of Rebecca Dering's sketchbooks that was drawn by Georgiana herself. It was found with two tickets to Westminster Hall for 11 July 1821, about nine years before Rebecca Dering was born. The sketch itself is a drawing of eight women with their heads sticking through the windows of the Parliament building while it is in session. Women used to gather in the space above the ceiling and listen in, since they were not allowed to participate and be present during a session. The drawing is presented from Georgiana's point of view as she is able to see the other women at her level also looking down on the structure beneath. The assumption that Georgiana drew this sketch is due to her elevated social position, allowing her to travel to Westminster and acquire tickets to enter the House of Commons. This drawing is significant because it shows how women politically engaged, whether it was from listening from a ventilator in the ceiling or persuading men to vote for local leaders. Though such women as Lady Chatterton were often able to influence politics, they could only do so indirectly, still managing to make their mark on a world almost a hundred years before female suffrage was achieved in the United Kingdom.

Most DIs are part of DEA's Diversion Control Program and are assigned to various DEA field offices throughout the U.S. and in several foreign countries. DIs are responsible for addressing the problem of diversion of controlled pharmaceuticals and regulated chemicals from the legitimate channels in which they are manufactured, distributed, and dispensed. The mission of a DI is to aid the U.S. pharmaceutical and chemical industries in complying with the Federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and other pertinent laws, as well as international treaties and conventions. DIs conduct investigations to uncover and investigate suspected sources of diversion and take appropriate criminal, civil and/or administrative actions. The DI position was originally known as a \\"Compliance Investigator\\" and was created to address the regulatory responsibilities of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) following the enactment of the CSA in 1970. Around 1983-84, the position had been given its current name. One key difference between the DI position and that of a DEA Special Agent is that DEA has never authorized DIs (or their Compliance Investigator predecessors) to carry firearms or to perform traditional law enforcement activities such as making arrests or controlling informants. DEA Special Agents, on the other hand, are fully commissioned Federal law enforcement officers. From 1971 to 1995, DIs were classified as series 1810 (general investigator) within the U.S. civil service system. In other Federal agencies, series 1810 investigators performed administrative investigative functions such as background investigations for security clearances (Office of Personnel Management and the Defense Security Service) or investigations of equal employment opportunity violations (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). In 1995, DEA reclassified DIs to series 1801 (general inspection, investigation, enforcement, and compliance) to reflect the position's mixture of criminal, civil, and administrative investigative duties. In order to accomplish their mission, DIs employ a wide range of investigative activities. One such activity is the scheduled regulatory investigation (or audit) of registered handlers of controlled substances. These investigations serve to deter diversion through evaluation of the registrants' record-keeping procedures, security safeguards and general compliance with the CSA and implementing regulations. Legitimate handlers of controlled substances subject to regulatory investigation include drug manufacturers, distributors (wholesalers), importers and exporters, and narcotic treatment programs, which are those programs primarily designed to furnish methadone to narcotic addicts as part of a program of addiction treatment. Most recently, there has been a growing push to investigate diversion of controlled substances involving sale and distribution via the Internet. The rapidly changing environment and an increase in Internet diversion of controlled substances has created a need for programs to target these sources of diversion. Frequently, DIs are involved in investigations aimed at the most serious practitioner-level registrant violators (e.g., medical practitioners, pharmacies, etc.) of controlled substances laws and regulations. These registrants have a documented or suspected history of diversion of drugs/chemicals into the illicit market. DIs collect and analyze information developed during their investigations and consult with supervisory personnel to determine if criminal prosecution is warranted. DIs work closely with DEA Special Agents and state and local law enforcement officers who provide assistance in making undercover purchases and executing search warrants. DIs also work closely with attorneys for DEA, the United States Attorneys Office and state and local prosecutors. DIs are required to testify as to the results of their investigations during criminal trials, grand jury proceedings and administrative hearings. A key function of the DI position involves maintaining liaison with all levels of the U.S. drug and chemical registrant population, including the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. DIs will often answer questions registrants have concerning their responsibilities under the CSA. Many DIs also become involved in their field office's demand reduction and community out-reach programs. Foreign-based DIs are experts in legal and regulatory matters pertaining to narcotics, psychotropic substances, and regulated chemicals. They serve as advisers/consultants to foreign host governments in establishing anti- diversion programs.

He received his education at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1843 with BA. The Jones baronetcy was created in 1831 for his father, who died in 1843. Willoughby Jones inherited the baronetcy from his brother Lawrence, who was murdered in Turkey in 1845. In July 1847 he won the seat of Cheltenham by a majority of 108; however, he was unseated by petition in May 1848. He was a member of the Canterbury Association from 27 March 1848. He lived at Cranmer Hall near Fakenham in Norfolk where in 1860 he had to order the felling of the Bale Oak. He was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1851.

He was awarded with the National Literary Award in 1982. He was also a Professor Emeritus at Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang.  Brief biography  Shahnon was born on 13 January 1933 as the youngest child to a peasant family in Banggol-Derdap, Sik, Kedah; his father Ahmad Abu Bakar hailed from Medan in the Dutch East Indies while Kelsum Mohd Saman was a Pattani native whose father came to settle in Malaya from Kampong Poseng in southern Thailand in the late 19th century. Shahnon's father had been previously working as a staff at the surveyor department, then a postman until the Second World War when the British forces hired him as a clandestine spy. He and one sibling of his were able to attend their studies at the Sultan Abdul Hamid College in Alor Setar through financial aid provided by the intelligence services as a reward to their father for his services - amidst common fears by most villagers that their children might embrace Christianity if they were educated in such schools at that time. After graduating from the school in 1954, he worked as a teacher in an English school in Kuala Terengganu. He served in the army from 1955 to 1956. After the stint, he worked as a teacher in various schools until 1967. In 1968 to 1971, he studied at the Australian National University, Canberra. After his graduation there, he taught at the Sultan Idris Education University in Tanjung Malim, Perak until 1975. From that time to his death, he was connected with the University of Science, Malaysia in Penang which included being a professor of literature starting in 1982. Shahnon was also a member of opposition political party Parti Islam Se-Malaysia. In the 1999 general election, he contested in the Parliamentary constituency of Sik (P.13) in which he won. He did not contest in the 2004 general election which saw PAS losing that seat to Barisan Nasional.General Election Malaysia: Kedah  Literary career  The first works were published in 1950s - he began his writing as an interpreter and a writer of short stories.

He first became ruler when his brother Murong Shifu was assassinated in 597, and became one of the longest-ruling monarchs in Tuyuhun history. During his reign, he had major conflicts with China's Sui Dynasty and Tang Dynasty, and in 635, during a Tang invasion, he was assassinated due to the people's resentment of his hostile attitude toward Emperor Taizong of Tang that led to the invasion. Background Murong Fuyun's father Murong Kual√º's reign (r. 540-591) as khan had been a turbulent one, particularly late in his reign, when even his crown princes were said to have been fearful for their deaths. As for his relations with China, then divided between Sui Dynasty (under the reign of Emperor Wen) and Chen Dynasty (under the reign of Chen Shubao), he was constantly attacking the provinces of Sui that were on the border of Tuyuhun, although after Sui destroyed Chen in 589, Murong Kual√º was fearful and vacated the border region. He died in 591 and was succeeded by Murong Fuyun's older brother Murong Shifu, who offered to submit to Emperor Wen and further to offer a daughter to serve as Emperor Wen's concubine‚Äîwhich Emperor Wen (who had very few, if any, concubines, due to his love for his wife Empress Dugu) declined. However, after that, there was a time of peace between Tuyuhun and Sui. Indeed, in 596, Emperor Wen created the daughter of a clansman Princess Guanghua and married her to Murong Shifu. For reasons lost to history, there was a major disturbance in Tuyuhun in 597, and Murong Shifu was assassinated. The people supported Murong Fuyun as khan. He sent emissaries to Sui to explain the situation and to ask for permission to, pursuant to Tuyuhun customs, marry Princess Guanghua as well. Emperor Wen agreed. (He and Princess Guanghua thereafter had at least one son, Murong Shun.) During Emperor Yang of Sui's reign Emperor Wen died in 604 and was succeeded by his son Yang Guang (as Emperor Yang), and initially, the relationship between Tuyuhun and Sui remained peaceful, with Murong Fuyun sending emissaries to submit tributes to Emperor Yang in 607, along with emissaries from Gaochang and the khan of Eastern Tujue himself, the Qimin Khan Ashina Ran'gan. However, later that year, the Sui official Pei Ju returned from a tour of the Xiyu states, and knowing that Emperor Yang was looking for targets to conquer, suggested to him that Xiyu states had a lot of treasures and that Tuyuhun was easy to conquer. Emperor Yang started considering attacking Tuyuhun, as a result. At one point, when Murong Fuyun sent Murong Shun as an emissary to Sui, Emperor Yang detained him. In 608, Pei persuaded the Tiele tribes to attack Tuyuhun, and Tiele forces defeated Tuyuhun forces. Murong Fuyun took his people east, entering Sui's Xiping Commandery (Ë•øÂπ≥, roughly modern Xining, Qinghai) to ask for refuge and aid against the Tiele. Emperor Yang sent his cousin Yang Xiong (Ê•äÈõÑ) the Prince of Ande and Yuwen Shu the Duke of Xu to escort Murong Fuyun. As Yuwen's forces approached, however, Murong Fuyun became apprehensive of the strength of his forces and decided to flee. Yuwen attacked him, and was said to have killed 3,000 Tuyuhun soldiers, and captured some 200 Tuyuhun nobles and 4,000 households. Murong Fuyun fled southwest into the mountains. Sui took over former Tuyuhun lands and divided it into four commanderies, settling minor criminals in those lands. By 609, however, Murong Fuyun appeared to have exited the mountains and taken the land back, and Emperor Yang, this time commanding the army himself, again attacked Tuyuhun. Emperor Yang's forces, while suffering some minor setbacks, were again able to send Murong Fuyun fleeing, reaffirming Sui's control over the Tuyuhun lands. With Murong Shun in his hands, he created Murong Shun as khan and had him, assisted by Ni Luozhou (Â∞ºÊ¥õÂë®) the Prince of Dabao, trying to head toward the Tuyuhun people to take over control. On the way, however, Ni was assassinated, and Murong Shun retreated back to Sui. In 613, Pei again persuaded the tribes submitting to Western Tujue's Heshana Khan to attack Tuyuhun. Little is known about Tuyuhun's status under Murong Fuyun the next several years, but at the time, Sui itself was collapsing, engulfed in agrarian rebellions throughout its territory.  During Emperor Gaozu of Tang's reign  By 619, Emperor Yang was dead, killed at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and Murong Shun, who had been with Emperor Yang at Jiangdu, had returned to the Sui capital Chang'an, then taken over by one of the generals who had rebelled against Emperor Yang, Li Yuan, who had also since then taken the throne and established a new state of Tang as its Emperor Gaozu, still fighting for supremacy of China with many other rebel rulers. Emperor Gaozu negotiated with Murong Fuyun, who had by now recovered the Tuyuhun lands, to attack one of his rivals, Li Gui the Emperor of Liang. Murong Fuyun agreed, and requested that Murong Shun be released. Emperor Gaozu agreed, and Murong Shun was able to return to Tuyuhun. (However, by this time, Murong Fuyun had already created another son to be his crown prince, and it was said that Murong Shun was depressed thereafter.) Starting 622, Murong Fuyun, apparently under the advice of his strategist the Prince of Tianzhu, began frequent pillaging attacks on Tang's prefectures bordering Tuyuhun, making several attacks per year. The attacks continued throughout the rest of Emperor Gaozu's reign, up to 626 (when he was forced to abdicate in favor of his son Li Shimin (as Emperor Taizong)).  During Emperor Taizong of Tang's reign  The Tuyuhun attacks appeared to decrease in frequency once Emperor Taizong took the throne, but did continue. Sometime before 634, Murong Fuyun appeared to make an overture toward peace‚Äîby sending an emissary to offer tributes to Emperor Taizong‚Äîbut even before the emissary left, Tuyuhun forces attacked and pillaged Shan Prefecture (ÈÑØÂ∑û, in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai). When Emperor Taizong sent emissaries to rebuke Murong Fuyun and summoned Murong Fuyun to Chang'an to meet him, Murong Fuyun refused, but responded by requesting that a Tang princess be given to his son, the Prince of Zun, in marriage. Emperor Taizong agreed, but ordered that the Prince of Zun personally arrive in Chang'an to marry the princess. When the Prince of Zun failed to do so, Emperor Taizong cancelled the marriage. Meanwhile, Murong Fuyun also attacked Lan and Kuo (ÂªìÂ∑û, also in modern Haidong) Prefectures and detained the Tang emissary Zhao Dekai (Ë∂ôÂæ∑Ê•∑). Emperor Taizong sent a number of emissaries to Tuyuhun to discuss the matter and also summoned Tuyuhun emissaries and personally had discussions with them. Murong Fuyun still did not relent. In fall 634, Emperor Taizong sent the generals Duan Zhixuan (ÊÆµÂøóÁéÑ) and Fan Xing (Ê®äËàà) to attack Tuyuhun with Tang forces, supplemented by soldiers from the Qibi (Â•ëËãæ) and Dangxiang tribes. When Duan began the attack, however, after minor successes, Tuyuhun forces simply began to elude him and refuse to engage him. Apparently immediately after he withdrew, Tuyuhun forces again attacked Liang Prefecture (Ê∂ºÂ∑û, roughly modern Wuwei, Gansu). Around the new year 635, Emperor Taizong sent Li Jing to attack Tuyuhun again. In summer 635, Tang forces began engaging Tuyuhun forces, and after some minor victories by Li Jing's subordinate Li Daozong, Murong Fuyun, apparently following the same strategies he used against Duan, burned the grasses and fled. Most of Li Jing's subordinates believed that it was dangerous to venture further without adequate grazing supplies and advised withdrawal, but Hou Junji opposed the idea, pointing out that this was the opportunity to destroy Tuyuhun. Li Jing agreed, and divided his forces into two branches‚Äîwith Li Jing himself and Xue Wanjun (ËñõËê¨Âùá) and Li Daliang heading northwest, and Hou and Li Daozong heading southwest. Both prongs continued to be successful. Eventually, Li Jing received news of Murong Fuyun's location and surprised Murong Fuyun, defeating his remaining forces. Murong Fuyun himself managed to flee, but the nobles, led by Murong Shun, killed the Prince of Tianzhu and surrendered. Murong Fuyun, in flight, was killed by his subordinates.The Zizhi Tongjian indicated that Murong Fuyun was killed by his subordinates, but both the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang indicated that he committed suicide. Emperor Taizong created Murong Shun the dual titles of Prince of Xiping and Zhugul√ºwugandou Khan (or Gandou Khan in short), to succeed Murong Fuyun.

It involved unpowered craft such as dinghies, canoes and coracles travelling along the canal. Early events involved stopping the traffic and carrying boats over a road where a low bridge prevented using the canal. Increasing difficulty with supervising this aspect of the event led to it being held on sections that did not involve crossing roads, and so it became a social event, rather than a campaigning tool. This led the organisers, the Shropshire Union Canal Society, to cancel the event after 2011, but the Friends of the Montgomery Canal took it over, and turned it into a triathlon, with cycling, walking or running, and paddling, covering the whole length of the canal. History The Montgomery Dinghy Dawdle was first held in 1985, and was seen as a way to highlight the problem of bridges which had been lowered, thus preventing navigation, and to show the public that the canal could be used by boats. Mary Awcock, the founder of the event, stated at the time that \\"It is important to demonstrate that a restored canal will provide a valuable local and tourist amenity.\\" The first event covered a stretch of canal either side of Gallowstree Bridge in Welshpool, which had been lowered and carried the A483 road over the canal. Some 30 boats took part, and when they got to the Bridge, volunteers stopped the traffic while all of the boats were carried across the road. Leaflets were given to the waiting drivers, and the event was a success, with good coverage in local newspapers and on the radio. The following three events all focused on Gallowstree Bridge or Whitehouse Bridge, dropped bridges which were either side of Welshpool. The events appeared to be having the required impact, and in late 1988, Mary Awcock announced that the fifth Dinghy Dawdle, to be held in 1989, would be the final one, as there would be no more road bridges around which boats needed to be portaged. Her optimism was caused by the fact the British Waterways Board had obtained an Act of Parliament undoing the abandonment order of 1944, and allowing them to reinstate the entire canal. Grant aid was available from the European Union, with half of the total cost of ¬£32 million needing to be raised locally. The project had the support of Powys County Council, Montgomeryshire District Council, the Welsh Tourist Board and the Mid-Wales Development Board. However, because of the amount of money involved, the approval of the Welsh Office was required, and this was refused by the Secretary of State for Wales, Peter Walker, in December 1988. The fifth Dinghy Dawdle was therefore not the last, as more campaigning was needed. Gallowstree Bridge was rebuilt to allow navigation in 1992, and was officially opened by David Suchet at the eighth rally, while Whitehouse Bridge was rebuilt in 1995, and the 1996 Dinghy Dawdle was able to pass under it with ease. With the Welshpool section making good progress by 1997, the organisers looked at holding future Dinghy Dawdles on other stretches of the canal, again with the main aim of highlighting lowered bridges, but there have been occasions when progress was celebrated. Thus the 2002 Dawdle included the reopening of Brynderwen Lock by Janet Lewis-Jones, a board member at British Waterways, and the 2003 event was held on the newly-reopened stretch of canal from Gronwen Wharf to Queen's Head. The 2001 event had to be cancelled due to an epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease. The 2004 and 2005 events were held on the Welshpool section, with the aim of reminding the public that boats bring a canal back to life. A total of 65 boats took part in the 2005 Dawdle, paddling from Welshpool to Burgedin. The following year saw Lembit √ñpik, the Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire, performing an opening ceremony at Newhouse Lock, on the section to the south of the Welshpool section. The aims of the event remained the same: to demonstrate the benefits of a functioning canal, and raise awareness of the need to reinstate bridges. In 2010, there were still ten that needed raising, of which five carried the A483 over the canal. =Triathlon= In 2011, the 26th and final Dinghy Dawdle event was held. 14 of the participants withdrew at the last minute due to inclement weather, but 29 boats took part. There had been increasing difficulty with supervising the crossing of roads in the latter years, and so the event tended to stick to sections where this was not necessary. It thus became more of a social event, rather than a campaigning tool, and so the Shropshire Union Canal Society took the decision to stop holding it. The Friends of the Montgomery Canal took it over in 2012, turning it into a triathlon with cycling, running or walking, but with paddling instead of swimming, and covering the whole length of the canal. Initially, the course involved cycling from Newtown to Welshpool, paddling from there to Llanymynech, and then walking to Frankton. By 2015, the composition of the event had been changed somewhat, with the first from Newtown to Pool Quay completed on a bicycle, along part of the Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury cycle route. The next was completed by walking or running, and included part of Offa's Dyke as well as crossing Vyrnwy Aqueduct. The final involved paddling, with the boats being carried around the three Aston Locks and the Graham Palmer Lock, which commemorates Graham Palmer, one of the founders of the Waterway Recovery Group. There were over 230 participants for the 2015 event, with 170 covering the full distance of . =Precursors= The use of small boats to highlight the plight of the canal was not new when the first Dinghy Dawdle was held. The canal had been officially abandoned by an Act of Abandonment obtained by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1944, although it had effectively been closed since 1936, when a breach occurred near Frankton Junction, which was never repaired. However, a trip along the whole canal was organised by Bill Thisthlewaite just after the end of the Second World War. He was a member of the fledgling Inland Waterways Association, and two boats took part, travelling along the Llangollen Canal and obtaining a toll ticket for the Montgomery section at Ellesmere, despite the fact that the canal was officially derelict. A horse and cart were used to carry the boats around the breached section. Subsequently, there were a series of seven Dinghy Rallies held at Welshpool, between 1970 and 1976. They were part of a one-day event, held in September, which featured stalls and a fairground, in addition to a range of races and competitions for owners of canoes or dinghies. Larger boats were encouraged to attend the final two rallies, and a number of trailed boats were brought to the canal, generating good publicity. British Waterways, the owner of the canal at the time, helped to organise two further rallies in the early 1980s. Organisation The event was organised by the Shropshire Union Canal Society, with help from the Friends of the Montgomery Canal, part of the Montgomery Waterway Restoration Trust, and supported by British Waterways. It involved unpowered craft such as dinghies, canoes and coracles travelling along the canal, and being carried across roads at some points where bridges had been lowered. In 2007 the dawdle was between Burgedin Locks and Llanymynech Wharf. It took place on Sunday, 10 June 2007. The 2008 dawdle took place on Sunday, 8 June 2008, starting at Redwith Bridge and ending at Queen's Head. The 2009 dawdle took place on Sunday, 7 June 2009, starting at Garthmyl and ending at Freestone Lock. The 2010 dawdle took place on Sunday, 13 June 2010, starting at Berriew with a lunch stop at Belan Locks and ending at Welshpool. After the boaters were welcomed by Derrick and Mary Awcock, who instigated the first dawdle in 1985, the local MP Glyn Davies started the event. This was the 25th time it had been run, and over 70 craft took part.

They originally started as a social club for local Latino youths to protect themselves from other violent youths. The Avenues, like most Mexican gangs in Los Angeles, are under the direct control of the Mexican Mafia when sent to State, County, or Federal prisons. History The Avenues were not always violent when they started and rarely engaged in illegal activities. They were started by the Flores brothers in the 1940s, but little is known about the brothers. The greatest of their crimes during the 1940s were simple assaults. As time progressed and their numbers increased, they became more violent and started to act more like a criminal street gang and less like a social club. In the late 1960s, when heroin started to flood the streets, they turned for the worse and would be forevermore labeled a criminal street gang. They increasingly took part in the illegal drug trade and these actions have continued to the present day. By the time the 1970s rolled around the Avenues had grown from a neighborhood social club into a highly organized gang whose territory stretched 6 miles. The Avenues also began to clash with neighboring gangs, such as Highland Park 13, Cypress Park Boys, Toonerville, Frog Town Rifa and Thee Rascals, in an attempt to assert their dominance. At first, it was common for rival gang members to fight one another to settle scores, but once cocaine hit the streets, gangs noticed that huge amounts of money can be generated from its distribution and shootings/stabbings became more prevalent. In the 1990s the main drug of choice in the Avenue's hood switched from cocaine to methamphetamine due to the establishment of industrial-sized meth laboratories in central-Mexico as well as the increased scarcity of cocaine after the fall of the Medellin cartel. During this period of time drug- addiction and violent crime became an everyday fact of life in northeast Los Angeles as rival gangs began fighting over drug turf. In the last half of the 1990s northeast Los Angeles had more homicides than any other part of the city with 500 gang-related shootings. The Avenues Gang are well known for their hatred of and hate crimes committed against African-American residents of their neighborhoods. Reflecting their hate-filled attitudes, they tried to keep even non-gang affiliated African-Americans from moving into the Highland Park area. Location The Avenues are located in Cypress Park, Glassell Park, Highland Park and Eagle Rock. Each of the Avenues cliques claims a gang territory based on where gang members live. The main cliques are 43rd Aves, Avenues 57, Cypress Avenues, Division street and Drew Street, all centered on the streets for which they are named. Their barrio once covered almost 6 square miles.Hewlitt, R. (Director) (2009). Highway to hell [Television series episode]. In Pearman, V. (Executive Producer), Gangland: Season 4, Episode 1. Los Angeles, CA: The History Channel. Members of the 43rd Aves were prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in 2006 for hate-crime charges for harassing, attacking and murdering African Americans in Highland Park. Many gang members have relocated to San Bernardino and Riverside counties ‚Äì and other areas of Los Angeles County ‚Äì due to the gang injunctions from the LAPD and on going gang wars with Cypress Park boys and Highland Park 13. Increased housing and rental prices in many east side neighborhoods have meant that former gang members have moved as rentals and home prices became too expensive. Even through all of this, the Avenues gang that rule Drew Street have survived countless convictions, injunctions, evictions and deportations. Police have desperately tried to break the gang for decades. Major successes came with raids and later the demolition of an Avenues bastion on Drew Street in Glassell Park. Culture The Avenues have a long history of involvement with the Mexican Mafia. Gang members are secretive and their code of silence is taken seriously and violations have lethal consequences. Respect and loyalty are considered to be very important. They challenge anyone and enforce the borders of their territory with deadly accuracy. Avenues gang members tattoos are known by a skull with a fedora and a bullet hole in the skull, or the letters LA, AVES, A's and Avenidas. The Avenues are one of LA's most violent gangs. President Bill Clinton spoke out against them in 1995. Criminal activity The Avenues gained national attention in 1995, when several members opened fire on a car that made a wrong turn into a Cypress Park alley, killing 3-year-old Stephanie Kuhen. Gang members were also accused of the August 2008 killing of Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Abel Escalante, 27, who worked at the Men's Central Jail guarding some of the county's most dangerous inmates. Escalante was gunned down outside his parents' Cypress Park home as he prepared to go to work. The Avenues are notorious for their participation in hate crimes against black inhabitants of their neighborhoods.Deverell, W., & Hise, G. (2010). A companion to los angeles. (p. 83). Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Some have called their actions a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Aside from their participation in hate related crimes, their main source of income is from illegal narcotics and human trafficking. The Avenues, as with most other Sure√±o sets, are well connected with Mexican drug cartels, specifically the Sinaloa cartel. Methamphetamine, cocaine, black-tar heroin, and marijuana is sold by street dealers who operate out of numerous hidden \\"trap-houses\\" where the product is stored and processed into smaller quantities. The Avenues also sell an arsenal of illegal/stolen firearms, ranging from handguns to assault rifles, as well as knives, clubs, etc. They are responsible for over 100 murders in the last 20 years alone, specifically rival gang members.

It was discovered by Hoffman-La Roche in 1957 during research into the related drug pethidine. Derivatives were tested to prove the theory that phenolic & non-phenolic opioids bind at different sites of the opiate receptor. Allylprodine is more potent as an analgesic than similar drugs such as Œ±-prodine, and the 3R,4S-isomer is 23 times more potent than morphine, due to the allyl group binding to an additional amino acid target in the binding site on the Œº-opioid receptor. It is also stereoselective, with one isomer being much more active. When modeled in three dimensions, the alkene overlays the alkenes found in 14-cinnamoyloxycodeinone and in 14-allyloxycodeinone, re-enforcing the presence of an interaction of the alkene. Allylprodine produces similar effects to other opioids, such as analgesia and sedation, along with side effects such as nausea, itching, vomiting and respiratory depression which may be harmful or fatal.

He is known for his genealogical research on many prominent American families. Biography Chester was born in Norwich, Connecticut on theApril 30, 1821. His father, Joseph Chester, was a grocer and his mother was Prudee Tracy. After Joseph died in 1832, Prudee married the Reverend John Hall, of the Ashtabula Episcopal Church in Ashtabula, Ohio. At an early age, Chester became a teacher at a school in Ballston, New York. In 1837, he was appointed clerk of a land agency office in Warren, Ohio. In 1838, at age 17, he moved to New York City in order to study law. However, Chester instead took a job as a clerk at Tappan & Co., a silk importer. Chester's literary tastes developed at an early age. While in New York, he contributed articles and poems to newspapers and magazines. The Knickerbocker magazine for January 1843 contains his poem Greenwood Cemetery,, credited to his favorite pseudonym, Julian Cramer. That same year, Chester published his first volume of poetry, Greenwood Cemetery and Other Poems, in New York and Boston. During this period, Chester travelled the United States lecturing on temperance issues. Around 1845, Chester moved to Philadelphia, where he obtained a job as a merchant's clerk. In 1847, and for some years subsequently, Chester was a commissioner of deeds in Philadelphia. From 1845 to 1850, he also served as the musical editor of Godey's Lady's Book magazine In 1852, he became one of the editors of the Philadelphia Inquirer and of the Daily Sun. After the consolidation of the city of Philadelphia, Chester was elected a member of the city council in 1854. During several sessions of Congress, Chester visited Washington D.C. as a corresponding editor and as an assistant clerk in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1885, Governor James Pollock of Pennsylvania appointed Chester as one of his aide-de-camps. Chester was granted the rank of colonel. His position ended in 1858, but he was called colonel after that. While in Washington D.C, Chester received a job to sell patent rights in England. He arrived in Liverpool on September 6, 1858. Various causes prevented Chester from succeeding in his undertaking, but he settled in London and made it his residence till his death. For a time, he kept up his connection with the American newspaper press and for about three years furnished a weekly letter from London to the Philadelphia Inquirer. His first work in England was John Rogers, the Compiler of the First Authorized English Bible, the Pioneer of the English Reformation, and its First Martyr,. Creating this book took an enormous toll on Chester's health. Joseph Lemuel Chester died in London, on May 26, 1882. He was buried in Nunhead Cemetery in London on May 31. Genealogical career After the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Chester considered returning to America. However, the U.S. Federal Government gave him a commission to research the British genealogical records on American families. In 1862, Chester obtained free access to Doctors' Commons, a British legal society, as a literary inquirer to examine all the wills that had been recorded there prior to 1700, and to make copies of those that applied to American families. Chester continued this work in Great Britain for the next 20 years, While working for the U.S. Government, Chester also performed special genealogical searches for his own clients and investigated the English descent of noted Americans. He printed some the resulting monographs himself, but most of them went without printing to his clients. Chester had wanted to publish a monograph on the family tree of President George Washington. However, Chester was never able to establish which English emigrant was the founder of the American branch of the Washington family, so the monograph was never completed. In 1869, Chester was one of the founders of the Harleian Society. He became a member of the first council of the Royal Historical Society in 1870, and a member of many other learned societies both in England and in America. Chester spent half his time replying to the inquiries of his numerous correspondents. In 1877, in recognition of Chester's genealogical research, Columbia University granted him the honorary degree of LL.D. On June 22, 1881, Oxford granted him the degree of D.C.L. Works As part of his work, Chester made extensive extracts from British parish registers. At his death, Chester left eighty- seven folio volumes of such extracts, each more than four hundred pages with seventy of the volumes carefully indexed. Between 1866 and 1869, Chester copied information from the matriculation register of Oxford University. He next made extensive extracts from The Old Marriage Allegations in the Bishop of London's Register, extending from 1598 to 1710. Chester's major work in London was the editing and annotating of The Marriage, Baptismal, and Burial Registers of the Collegiate Church or Abbey of St. Peter, Westminster, dedicated to Queen Victoria. He spent ten years on this book and allowed the Harleian Society to issue it as one of their publications. Chester's literary executor, George Edward Cokayne, Norroy King of Arms, sold the manuscript of the Matriculations at the University of Oxford for ¬£1,500, and five volumes of Marriage Allegations in the Bishop of London's Register, &c.;, for ¬£500 to Leonard Lawrie Hartley. When Hartley died, these manuscripts were purchased in 1885 by Mr. Quaritch. The Matriculations were printed in eight volumes (1891) and the Marriages in one volume (1887) under the editorship of Joseph Foster. The Harleian Society also printed the Marriages from a duplicate copy of Chester's manuscript in 1887.

This field has emerged from the integration of molecular biology into traditional epidemiological research. Molecular epidemiology improves our understanding of the pathogenesis of disease by identifying specific pathways, molecules and genes that influence the risk of developing disease.Miquel Porta, editor. Greenland S, Hern√°n M, dos Santos Silva I, Last JM, associate editors (2014). A dictionary of epidemiology, 6th. edition. New York: Oxford University Press. More broadly, it seeks to establish understanding of how the interactions between genetic traits and environmental exposures result in disease.  History  The term \\"molecular epidemiology\\" was first coined by Kilbourne in a 1973 article entitled \\"The molecular epidemiology of influenza\\". The term became more formalized with the formulation of the first book on Molecular Epidemiology: Principles and Practice by Schulte and Perera. At the heart of this book is the impact of advances in molecular research that have given rise to and enable the measurement and exploitation of the biomarker as a vital tool to link traditional molecular and epidemiological research strategies to understand the underlying mechanisms of disease in populations.  Modern use  While most molecular epidemiology studies are using conventional disease designation system for an outcome (with the use of exposures at the molecular level), compelling evidence indicates that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous process differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual (\\"the unique disease principle\\"),Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, Nishihara R, Cho E, Wolpin BM, Meyerhardt AJ, Meissner A, Schernhammer ES, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E. Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease. Mod Pathol 2013;26:465-484. considering uniqueness of the exposome and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process in each individual. Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly, cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of standardized methodologies and guidelines as well as paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs.Sherman ME, Howatt W, Blows FM, Pharoah P, Hewitt SM, Garcia-Closas M. Molecular pathology in epidemiologic studies: a primer on key considerations. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2010;19(4):966-972.Ogino S, King EE, Beck AH, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Interdisciplinary education to integrate pathology and epidemiology: Towards molecular and population-level health science. Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:659-667. The use of \\"molecular epidemiology\\" for this type of research masked the presence of these challenges, and hindered the development of methods and guidelines.Kuller LH. Invited commentary: the 21st century epidemiologista need for different training? Am J Epidemiol 2012;176(8):668-671.Ogino S, Beck AH, King EE, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Ogino et al. respond to \\"The 21st century epidemiologist\\". Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:672-674. Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the premise that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes.  Analytical methods  The genome of a bacterial species fundamentally determines its identity. Thus, gel electrophoresis techniques like pulsed-field gel electrophoresis can be used in molecular epidemiology to comparatively analyze patterns of bacterial chromosomal fragments and to elucidate the genomic content of bacterial cells. Due to its widespread use and ability to analyse epidemiological information about most bacterial pathogens based on their molecular markers, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is relied upon heavily in molecular epidemiological studies.  Applications  Molecular epidemiology allows for an understanding of the molecular outcomes and implications of diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposure, particularly how these choices and exposures result in acquired genetic mutations and how these mutations are distributed throughout selected populations through the use of biomarkers and genetic information. Molecular epidemiological studies are able to provide additional understanding of previously-identified risk factors and disease mechanisms. Specific applications include: * Molecular surveillance of disease risk factors * Measuring the geographical and temporal distribution of disease risk factors * Characterizing the evolution of pathogens and classifying new pathogen species  Criticism  While the use of advanced molecular analysis techniques within the field of molecular epidemiology is providing the larger field of epidemiology with greater means of analysis, Miquel Porta identified several challenges that the field of molecular epidemiology faces, particularly selecting and incorporating requisite applicable data in an unbiased manner. Limitations of molecular epidemiological studies are similar in nature to those of generic epidemiological studies, that is, samples of convenience - both of the target population and genetic information, small sample sizes, inappropriate statistical methods, poor quality control, and poor definition of target populations.

This species is the only known member of its genus. Description The goldsinny wrasse can reach a total length of , though most do not exceed . Its coloration is brown, greenish or orange-red and there are two noticeable dark spots which readily identify it from other eastern Atlantic wrasses, one on the dorsal fin and one situated on the caudal peduncle immediately in front of the caudal fin. It has a slender body with a small, pointed head and large eyes. The large, fleshy lipped mouth is equipped with two rows of small teeth in each jaw. Distribution The goldsinny wrasse is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Norway south as far as Morocco. It is also found throughout the western and central Mediterranean Sea as far as Antalya in Turkey, but it is absent from the far eastern Mediterranean. It extends through the Sea of Marmara into the Black Sea. Habitat and biology The goldsinny wrasse is normally found in areas dominated by rock or by boulders and requires there to be many crevices for it to hide in. It is most frequently recorded at depths of between but it is infrequently recorded in rockpools near the low water mark. Their diet consists of bryozoan, small crustaceans and molluscs. it is often associated with beds of algae and eelgrass. These wrasses attain maturity at two years of age, with the life span being up to eight years, and they do not display sexual dimorphism. spawning takes place from the winter into summer. When breeding the males defend territories. Spawning happens in mid water and when the pelagic eggs hatch the larvae are planktonic. Human uses The goldsinny wrasse is fond of sea lice and has been used to clean salmon in commercial farms together with the Ballan wrasse. Both these wrasses are not easy to retain in the salmon farms, as they escape through the nets, being significantly smaller than the salmon. This species is caught as a food fish by local indigenous peoples and is popular as a game fish. It is also a popular fish for display in public aquaria.

Hill immediately took over both the captaincy and Bill's No. 6 shirt, and after Hill's arrival, Kingdon only made one further appearance, and in January 1938 joined Yeovil & Petters United as player-manager. =Yeovil Town= He remained with Yeovil for the duration of World War II, but in 1946 he returned to his trade as a carpenter. In 1947 he accepted the position as manager at Weymouth, combining this with running the Fountain Hotel in Weymouth. He died in Weymouth in March 1977, aged 71.

The town of Deeford is also within the locality. In the , the locality of Wowan had a population of 216 people.  Geography  Both towns are located in the north-east of the locality with Wowan at and Deeford at near a crossing point of the Dee River. History Wowan takes its name from the Wowan railway station, which in turn was named from the Aboriginal word for Australian brush-turkey. Deeford was originally known as Dundee, but was renamed Deeford on 6 November 1913 by the Queensland Surveyor-General. Dundee Provisional School opened on 1 June 1900. It closed in 1904 but reopened in 1905. On 1 January 1909 it became Dundee State School. It closed in 1911. The Dawson Valley railway line was built from 1910 and by 1912 its first stage of construction had reached the area, terminating at the Wowan railway station on 16 October 1912. In 1912 two schools opened. One was Dundee Camp Provisional School (in the area that became the town of Wowan), presumably to provide education to the children of the railway workers living in the camp during the construction of the railway. The other was Dundee State School (in what is now Deeford). In 1915 Dundee Camp Provisional School was renamed Wowan Provisional School and on 1 May 1916 became Wowan State School. In 1917 Dundee State School was renamed Deeford State School. Deeford State School closed in 1941. Woman was settled in 1912.

Football career Kirton was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. Kirton was a member of the Temperance Society and played for Pandon Temperance before joining Leeds City in May 1919. After Kirton had played only one game for the club, City went out of business and he was transferred to Aston Villa for ¬£500 in October 1919. In the 1919‚Äì20 season Aston Villa enjoyed a successful run in the FA Cup beating QPR (2-1), Manchester United (2-1), Sunderland (1-0), Tottenham Hotspur (1-0) and Chelsea (3-1). The club played Huddersfield Town in the final at Stamford Bridge. The referee, Jack Howcroft, entered the Villa dressing-room before the game and warned Frank Barson that he would be sent off for any indiscretion. According to the authors of The Essential Aston Villa, \\"the normally unflappable Barson was taken aback and his performance was uncharacteristically cautious for much of the game.\\" Kirton scored the only goal of the game and Villa won the cup for the sixth time in its history. Kirton won his first and only international cap for England against Northern Ireland on 22 October 1921. Kirton scored England's only goal in the 1‚Äì1 draw.

It depicts events that unfolded at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp following the liberation of the camp by British troops in April 1945. Written by Justin Hardy and Peter Guinness, it nevertheless cites its sources from eye witness accounts of people who were there at the time. Transcript of Johnson's recollections of his experiences entitled \\"The Relief of Belsen concentration camp: recollections and reflections of a British Army doctor\\", 1970, ca., accessed at the United States Holocaust Museum, 6 April 2013. These accounts are referred to throughout the film. It was directed by Justin Hardy, and produced in association with the Wellcome Trust.  Plot  An ambulance crew are diverted away from the front in Northern Germany to help with an unfolding medical emergency at Belsen. At first, Lt Col Mervyn Gonin thinks it is a prisoner of war camp; however the full enormity of the purpose of the camp is soon revealed. A bemused Derrick Sington (Tobias Menzies) tells the rabbi: \\"I'm afraid it's mainly your crowd\\". Soon they realise that three quarters of the camp inmates are Jewish women and children from all over Eastern Europe. Brigadier Glyn Hughes (played by Corin Redgrave) tells his men that typhus is the main concern, and that this will be dealt with by Lt Col James Johnston (Iain Glen), a highly respected officer who has performed heroic deeds in the past. Secretly, however, as revealed by his private memoir, \\"Johnny\\" as he is known, has terrible misgivings about the task in hand. There are some 40 thousand prisoners living in two hundred huts, in the most terrible conditions imaginable. The men cannot comprehend what they have stumbled upon. As the days pass, more and more inmates die, from typhus and starvation. The British army have arranged a truce with the Germans to try to contain the spreading infection; eventually Johnston (Iain Glen) forces the SS to remove the corpses for burial. They continue to use the German nurses for the treatment of the typhus patients. The rabbi, Leslie Hardman, is desperate to help the inmates, but when he smuggles totally inappropriate food to them, he does more harm than good, and many die. The rations they are being given are not working either, and despite managing to control the typhus, hundreds are dying every day. Johnston and his officers risk being overwhelmed by the situation. Polish doctor Ada Bimko (Frog Stone) tells Johnston and Gonin of the horrors of the Holocaust. An English nurse, Jean MacFarlane (Jemma Redgrave), arrives. She is inexperienced, and at first Johnston dismisses her. However, she shows strength of character and supports Johnston when he starts to crumble. Eventually, after a raid on the hospital by the Luftwaffe, Gonin challenges Johnston's competence, calling him a \\"pen-pusher\\", but he has loyal friends who point to his past bravery. Medical students arrive at the camp to feed the inmates a special \\"Bengal Famine mixture\\" that has been sent over from India. Despite initial failure, the women slowly take the mixture, and progress is finally made. As Gonin, initially hostile, tells a despairing Johnston: \\"It's the little things that matter here\\". A shipment of lipstick is flown in to Johnston's disgust, but the women are thrilled, and he realises then how important it is for them to feel like women again after the degradation they have suffered. Despite several setbacks many inmates are fit enough to prepare to leave the camp, and the women are kitted out in second-hand clothes from a makeshift \\"shop\\" called \\"Harrods\\". Themes Throughout the film, original footage is seamlessly interspersed with the dramatisation. Richard Dimbleby is seen both in the drama and in the BBC report he gave in 1945. Johnston and Sington watch footage of a tractor scooping up corpses ready for burial, and Johnston tells Sington: \\"I don't think people are going to want to see this.\\" But Sington disagrees. He tells Johnston: \\"I think people should see this.\\" The film ends with a condensed account of the lives of the main characters after they left Belsen. We are told that they all kept in contact through the years, and all were deeply affected by their experience there.

Life Born at Colchester, Clark attended King's College London in 1842, and was made an Associate of King's College in 1845. Soon afterwards he became a pupil of, and subsequently an assistant to, J. Birkinshaw, M. Inst. C.E., under whom he was employed for three years on the works of the York and North Midland railway system. In 1850 he was connected with Sir Goldsworthy Gurney in the warming and ventilation of the houses of parliament. In 1851 he entered into partnership with A. W. Makinson, M. Inst. C.E., the firm devoting special attention to the warming and ventilating of public buildings. He shortly afterwards obtained the appointment of surveyor to the local board of health of Kingston-upon-Hull, and devised a complete system of drainage for that town. In 1854 he entered the service of the East Indian Railway Company, and, after acting for a year as resident engineer on a portion of the East India railway, became the secretary and subsequently the engineer to the municipality of Calcutta. Clark devoted himself with zeal to his work, and very soon proposed a complete scheme for the drainage of the city, only imperfectly carried out owing to the expense. He also devised a system of waterworks, comprising three large pumping stations, with their filter beds and settling tanks. He returned to England in 1874, when he entered into partnership with W. F. Batho, M. Inst. C.E., and in the same year received the appointment of consulting engineer to the Oudh and Rohilkund Railway Company. In December 1874 he visited Madras, where he remained four months planning a system of drainage for that city. He was selected by the colonial office in 1876, in concert with the government of New South Wales, to advise and report upon the water supply and drainage of Sydney. During a residence of two years in the Australian colonies he prepared schemes of a like description for Port Adelaide, Newcastle, Bathurst, Goulburn, Orange, Maitland (the Walka Water Works), and Brisbane, and afterwards for Wellington and Christchurch in New Zealand. Among Clark's inventions was his tied brick arch, of which examples exist in Calcutta and in other places in India; and he was joint patentee with William F. Batho of the well-known steam road roller. Among his schemes was a proposal for reclaiming the salt-water lakes in the neighbourhood of Calcutta. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 2 February 1864, and a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1867. He died from liver disease, at Surbiton, on 22 January 1880. He was the writer of The Drainage of Calcutta, 1871.The drainage of Calcutta: a paper read at the Bengal social science congress, held at the town hall, Calcutta, on 2 February 1871 (Google eBook) References Category:1821 births Category:1880 deaths Category:English civil engineers Category:English inventors Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Associates of King's College ","title":"William Clark (inventor)"},{"id":"13924735","text":"Santo Stefano de PineaIts most ancient name, referring to its Rione ‚Äì the Rione Pigna ‚Äì and to the \\"pigna\\" or pine cone that surmounts its bell-tower. or more commonly Santo Stefano del Cacco is a church in Rome dedicated to Saint Stephen, located at Via di Santo Stefano del Cacco 26. Facade. Name \\"del Cacco\\" may refer to the Roman deity Cacus, or more likely to a statue of the dog-headed ancient Egyptian god Thoth (from the temple of the ancient Egyptian deities Isis and Serapis, the Iseum Campense, built in 43 BC, on whose ruins the church was originally built and twelve columns from which were re-used in the church's nave), misunderstood as a monkey or \\"Macaco\\" (later corrupted to Cacco). History Its construction date is uncertain, though it is assumed to have been in the reign of pope Hadrian I (772‚Äì795). It was definitely in existence at the time of pope St. Paschal I (817-824), who added an apsidal mosaic (lost in the 1607 rebuild) of himself with a model of the church. Under Paschal II (1099‚Äì1118) the painters Gregorius and Petrolinus were employed to work on the church's apsidal decoration. A new bell-tower (not visible from the street) was built in 1160, and still survives. In 1563 it was assigned by pope Pius IV (1559‚Äì1565) to the Sylvestrine Fathers, by whom it is still run, and they soon carried out a minor restoration. Other restorations and renovations occurred in 1607 (gutting the apse), c.1640 (giving the church its current baroque appearance, with a simple 2 storey fa√ßade, probably by Antonio Canziani), 1725, 1857 and 2007 (interior). In 1940, the church was threatened with demolition by the expansion of the central police-station in the neighbouring former monastery of Santa Marta, though this was averted. The interior of the church is at present undergoing another comprehensive restoration. Paolo Maruscelli (1594‚Äì1649) designed the church's travertine portal, flanked by pilasters and surmounted by a triangular pediment, and the plate above it reads: D. STEPH. PROT. CONG. MONAC. / SILVESTRINORVM. The fa√ßade's second order includes a window crowned with a segmented pediment and flanking pilasters, and right at the top is a triangular pediment with a small window, a rare feature in Roman churches.
