Originally built in 1866-67 to house a private academy and the local Masonic lodge, it is notable as an early design of Charles F. Douglas, a Maine native whose career began in Somerset County. The building is a fine local example of Second Empire design, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It has been owned since 1916 by the local chapter of the Grange. Description and history The Grange hall is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, set facing northeast on a triangular lot at the junction of Upper Main Street and Mercer Road (United States Route 2). It is three bays wide and four deep, with a bellcast mansard roof. The center bay of the front facade has a double door set in an arch on the first level, a pair of narrow round-arch windows at the second level, and the mansard roof above is broken by a bellcast gable dormer with a false bullseye window. The flanking bays, like those on the side elevations have sash windows. Gable dormers with molded sides pierce the mansard roof on all elevations, although some of the original ones have been removed. The interior has retained its basic organization. The entrance opens to a vestibule, with a staircase going up to the right, and a hallway down the center of the building leads past two smaller classrooms to a larger one at the rear. On the second floor the arrangement is similar, except the large room also has a stage at the west end. The third floor, which was designed for use by the Masonic lodge, has two storage rooms and a large function space with raised platforms on the sides, and ornamental plasterwork in the ceiling. The Eaton School was founded in 1865 by Hamilton Fairfield Eaton, and originally shared space in a Greek Revival meeting house and female academy. Rising enrollments prompted Eaton to retain Charles F. Douglas to design this building, which was erected in 1866-67, with funding support from the local Masonic lodge. Although Eaton retired in 1883, the school continued in various guises (and with some interruptions) until 1916, when the building was acquired by the local Grange chapter. The building is an early work of Charles F. Douglas, a native of Brunswick, Maine, whose early career work occurred primarily in Norridgewock and Skowhegan. He later made substantial contributions to the architecture of Lewiston and Auburn before moving to Philadelphia. Douglas' Norridgewock residence is also listed on the National Register.

The sound pads are triggered by sensitive hammers activated while hopping, jumping or dancing. The tone is bell-like and the notes are tuned in a pentatonic sequence and can be played note by note to play a melody, or sounded together to play a chord.

He was the official restorer of Notre Dame Cathedral, and collected and exhibited art by Louis Daguerre, Charles Marie Bouton, Charles Arrowsmith, Charles Renoux, and others. As well as restoring art, his business made and sold furniture in various styles for the French royal family and others.. In June 1833 Alph.

The company's name for the device would end up to be the most commonly used one, soon adapted as 'phenakistiscope' in England (and later misspelled as 'phenakistoscope'). Giroux is also known for constructing the daguerreotype cameras designed by Daguerre,. the first commercially manufactured photographic camera in the world. A mass-produced daugerrotype camera cabinet manufactured by Giroux, who was the brother-in-law of Louis Daguerre, was exhibited at the 1839 Exposition des produits de l'industrie française in Paris.

It is a rectangular wood frame structure, two stories in height, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and a full-width single-story porch across the front. The front corners of the building have pilasters, which rise support an entablature across the front below the eave. The front facade has windows in the second level, and a two- part ground level. The left side of the ground floor houses a storefront with a center entry flanked by large fixed-pane windows, while the right side has a sash window and doorway that provides access to the upper level. A series of telescoping ells project to the rear of the main block. The structure was built in 1840, and is believed to be the town's oldest surviving commercial building.

It was first described in 1892 by Giacomo Bresadola, and is named in honour of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species is found in Europe, Asia and North America. It produces small mushrooms of an ochre colour, with a prominent umbo, fibres on the cap and a distinctive bulb at the base of the stem. It grows from soil in mixed woodland, and is encountered in summer and autumn, though is not common. Ecologically, it feeds through use of ectomycorrhiza. Inocybe cookei has been described as both toxic and non-toxic, but either way, is not advised for consumption. Taxonomy and naming Inocybe cookei was first described by Giacomo Bresadola in 1892; the specific epithet cookei honours the British mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. Mycologists J. Stangl and J. Veselský described Inocybe kuthanii in 1979, which was later described as a variety of Inocybe cookei (Inocybe cookei var. kuthanii) by Thom Kuyper in 1986, but MycoBank now lists both names as synonyms of I. cookei. The mushroom is commonly known as the straw fibrecap. Within Inocybe, it is placed within the subgenus Inosperma, and was previously categorised within the section Rimosae. However, phylogenetic analysis has shown that section Rimosae as formerly defined does not form a monophyletic group (that is, descended from a single exclusive ancestor), and former Rimosae species are better grouped into two clades, Maculata and Rimosae. Phylogenetic analysis has placed the species in the clade Maculata. Other species joining I. cookei in the Maculata clade include I. maculata, I. quietiodor, I. rhodiola, I. adaequata, and I. erubescens. Description Inocybe cookei has a conical or bell-shaped cap of between in diameter. As the mushrooms age, the cap becomes flatter, and an umbo becomes prominent. The margin of the cap frequently cracks towards the centre. The cap is an ochre colour, and the upper surface is covered in long fibres. The silky fibres thickly cover the cap, starting and the centre and extending to the cap's margin. The species has a whitish or ochre stem of in height by in thickness. There is a distinctive marginate bulb at the base of the stem, and no ring. The flesh is white, becoming yellow with age. Inocybe cookei mushrooms have closely packed adnexed gills (gills that are attached to the stem only on part of their depth). Gills on young mushrooms are whitish, then become a grey- tinged pale ochre before becoming cinnamon yellow. =Microscopic features= Inocybe cookei leaves a snuff-brown spore print. The spores themselves are bean-shaped, measuring from by . The walls of the spores (which are around thick) can be smooth or slightly wrinkled, and there is a distinct depression just above the hilum (the scar where the spore was once attached to the basidium). The basidia are four-spored, and the thin-walled, gill-edge cheilocystidia are pear-shaped. =Similar species= The species can be differentiated from the similar I. praetervisa by its spores; the latter \\"has irregular, lumpy spores\\". Inocybe rimosa, the split fibrecap, is also similar in appearance; the rarer I. cookei can be differentiated by the smell of honey and the marginate bulb. The colouration, as well as the thick stem with a bulb, are features shared by two other species of Inocybe; I. mixtilis and I. cryptocystis. Another fragrant Inocybe is I. pyriodora, which has an odor resembling cinnamon, or ripe pears in mature specimens; unlike I. cookei, it lacks a bulb at the base of its stem, and bruises a reddish colour when handled or with age. Distribution and habitat Inocybe cookei is an occasional to frequent mushroom, found growing in mixed woodland on the ground. It is ectomycorrhizal, and grows from summer to late autumn, solitarily or in \\"trooping groups\\". It has been recorded in Europe, Russia, China, Mexico, and the United States. Toxicity and edibility Inocybe cookei has been described as both poisonous (due to the presence of muscarine compounds) and non-toxic. Consumption of mushrooms containing muscarine compounds could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: excess salivation, lacrimation, uncontrolled urination or defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms may also be known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure. The flesh of the mushroom has a mild taste and a slight smell of honey. Regardless of its actual toxicity or edibility, it is considered \\"best avoided\\".

Luring Amazo to his Fortress of Solitude in the Arctic, after teleporting himself and Ivo there and hiding Ivo, Superman unleashes his new secret weapon on the android: a small vehicle he has dubbed the Supermobile, which is capable of duplicating all of his powers, including invulnerability, as it is constructed of Supermanium, a metal so strong that \\"only Superman's heat vision can soften the substance, and only his super-strength is mighty enough to mold it!\\"Action Comics #481, DC Comics, March 1978, pg. 13. He finally travels five days into the future, when the radiation has passed Earth, enabling him to regain his powers. Superman rarely uses the Supermobile again after the red sun radiation passes and he regains his powers in the following issue.Cary Bates (w); Curt Swan (a). \\"This is a Job For Supermobile!\\", Action Comics #482, DC Comics, April 1978. He uses it again a few months later, after fighting the Atomic Skull and Titano.Martin Pasko (w); Curt Swan (a). \\"Beware the Eyes That Paralyze!\\", Superman #324, DC Comics, June 1978. The vehicle has made a few unofficial cameo appearances in recent years. A few different versions of the Supermobile are seen protecting a futuristic Ivy Town in All-New Atom #8.Gail Simone (w); Mike Norton (a). \\"The Man Who Swallowed Eternity (Part II of II) - The Entropy of the Universe Tends to a Maximum\\", All-New Atom #8, DC Comics, April 2007. The classic design of the vehicle can also be seen atop the sign of Funky Flashman's used automobile dealership (which also contains a lot full of Batmobiles from various media) in the fifth chapter of the Doctor Thirteen serial \\"Architecture and Morality\\" in Tales of the Unexpected #5.Brian Azzarello (w); Cliff Chiang (a). \\"Architecture and Morality Chapter Five - Sugar Mountain\\", Tales of the Unexpected #5, DC Comics, April 2007. Abilities The Supermobile does not just duplicate Superman's powers, it acts as a conduit for the Man of Steel's powers, allowing him to channel them through the vehicle itself. The Supermanium hull of the SMB shields Superman from red solar radiation that would rob him of his powers, making it so that he remains at the height of his abilities as long as he is within the vehicle. When Amazo remarks that no engine on Earth could react as quickly and easily as the Supermobile's, Superman responds, \\"You're right about that, Amazo! But who said anything about an engine?\\", revealing that the vehicle is powered completely by Superman himself.Action Comics #481, DC Comics, March 1978, pg 10. Besides invulnerability and flight, the Supermobile also channels Superman's other powers using the following devices: * Large mechanical arms mounted on either side of the cockpit area, allowing Superman to both punch and grasp. * A scope on the control panel which can be adjusted to work with each of Superman's vision-related powers: normal, telescopic, microscopic, x-ray, heat, and night vision. * Air jets that pop out from various points around the vehicle, allowing Superman to use his super breath if he blows into a face mask attached to the control panel. * A monitor and other communications and listening devices substitute for his super hearing. In other media =Cartoons= * The Supermobile appeared in at least three episodes of Super Friends: \\"Terror from the Phantom Zone\\" (from the 1978 season), \\"Lex Luthor Strikes Back\\" (from the 1979-1980 season, The World's Greatest Super Friends), and \\"The Krypton Syndrome\\" (from the so-called lost episodes) of 1983. * In the episode \\"Battle of the Super-Heroes!\\" of Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Lex Luthor uses what looks like a version of the Supermobile, albeit in his standard colors of purple and green, to challenge Superman. It was quickly destroyed. =Toys= * Corgi Toys made die-cast models of the Supermobile in two different sizes, the \\"Junior\\" model (3 inches in length, about the size of a Matchbox or Hot Wheels car) and a larger, 1/36 scale version. * Kenner produced a Supermobile to go with their Super Powers Collection, one that was big enough to fit the line's action figures. The design differed a bit from the original, however; the two mechanical arms were absent, replaced by a front-mounted \\"Krypton Action Ram\\".

Keith Crown: Watercolors. Columbia, Missouri: University of Missouri Press, 1986. Keith Crown Biography Keith Crown was born in Keokuk, Iowa and grew up in Gary, Indiana. He attended the Art Institute of Chicago from 193640 and from 194546, earning a bachelor's degree in fine art. He served as Staff Sergeant and Infantry Artist in the South Pacific during World War II, where he was a field correspondent providing combat-area illustrations to Yank, the Army Weekly. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. From 1946 to 1983, Crown taught painting and drawing at the University of Southern California Roski School of Fine Art. During his early years in Los Angeles, he painted abstract seascapes, cityscapes and still lifes in oil, casein and watercolor. Like John Marin and Charles Burchfield, Crown wanted to paint invisible elements of nature: wind, moisture, temperature, odors and sounds that were specific to a particular place and time. Other artists who were principal influences in his development include Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Matisse as well as the contemporary painters Milton Avery, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko. In 1956, he took his first sabbatical leave to Taos, New Mexico, which \\"was to become an important source of new subject matter.\\"Reich, Sheldon. Keith Crown: Watercolors. Columbia, Missouri: University of Missouri Press, 1986. pp. 52-53. This period of the late 50s and early 60s marks the beginning of the shift to watercolor as his primary medium, and when he first describes himself as an abstract impressionist.Reich, Sheldon. Keith Crown: Watercolors. Columbia, Missouri: University of Missouri Press, 1986. pp. 52-53. Throughout his career Crown was particularly drawn to the landscape of the American southwest and eventually built a home near Taos, but he also spent summers and sabbaticals painting in the states of Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Illinois, Missouri, and as far away as England and the Netherlands. In 1959 Crown served as President of the National Watercolor Society (NWS, formerly the California Watercolor Society) and was awarded its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.http://www.nationalwatercolorsociety.org/newsletter/NWS_News_2009_Fall.pdf He was one of the Founding Board of Directors, Los Angeles chapter of Artist's Equity. In 2003 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Watercolor Honor Society. He retired from teaching in 1983 and moved to Columbia, Missouri with his wife, a professor of Art History at the University of Missouri, Columbia.

The team was highlighted in the book The New Cool. History Team 1717, consisting of the 32-student senior class of the DPEA, began their first season during the 2005-2006 school year, under the direction of DPEA founder and director, Amir Abo-Shaeer. Since then, D’Penguineers have participated annually in the FIRST Robotics Competition, developing new techniques for student education, team communication, team collaboration, and build season preparation. Abo-Shaeer received a Macarthur Foundation award in 2010 for his work with the school and the team. Team 1717 was disbanded after the 2015 season. Pre-build season Preparations for the robotics build season begin at the launch of the school year, where Team 1717 students take both an Advanced Engineering class and an ROP FIRST Robotics class. During the months leading up to the competition, students begin to specialize, in areas such as computer programming, CAD, electronics, and machining working with mentors from the surrounding community. Throughout the year, the students are exposed not only to this educational specialization, but they also learn to manage the business aspects of the team—they also make up presentation teams, apparel managers, travel planners, and account managers, among others. The process of the actual creation of a robot, from initial brainstorms to paper planning to physical building, is a concept foreign to most high school students, and the pre-build season is devoted to developing the skills and team unity necessary to have a successful build season. Build season The FIRST Robotics Competition begins in January, when the game is revealed, and continues for six weeks, until the completed robot is shipped. Team 1717 assembles to watch the game video, and the build season is off to a running start. Over the following six weeks, each student on Team 1717 will spend over 360 hours working to collectively design, build, and program their game robot, as well as strategize and organize to find the most effective way to play the game. Competitions Once the Team 1717's bot has been shipped, D’Penguineers attend regional FIRST Robotics Competitions and compete for their chance to go to the international FIRST Championship. In past years, Team 1717 has attended regional competitions in San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Arizona, and has qualified for the FIRST Championship in Atlanta, Georgia for three consecutive years.

They are a regional and seasonal specialty of Basel, Switzerland, where they are made and sold at around the time of the autumn fair. Name \\"Mässmogge\\" and its spelling variants \\"Mässmögge\\", \\"Mässmocke\\" or \\"Messmocken\\" are words in Basel German, the local dialect. \\"Mäss-\\" refers to the Messe, the fair at which the candy is sold, while \\"Mogge\\" is derived from the Middle High German word Mocken, meaning \\"big piece\\" or \\"lump\\". Description and economic significance An open Mässmogge, showing the hazelnut praline filling. Mässmogge are about long, wide and weigh about . They consist of a striped, colored, rather soft sugar candy shell in various flavors (chocolate, lemon, strawberry, etc., corresponding to the shell's color), and of a soft hazelnut praline mass at the center, which has a more pronounced flavor than the shell. A variant, the Glasmogge (\\"lump of glass\\") has no hazelnut filling. It consists only of a piece of sugar candy, which is normally green and peppermint-flavored. As of 2008, about one million Mässmogge are produced annually,Another 2008 source indicates two million: of which 70% are the hazelnut-filled variant. Half of the production is sold to market traders visiting fairs across Switzerland, although most Mässmogge are sold at the Basel autumn fair. The other half is produced for retail and specialty stores mostly in and around Basel and Solothurn. Production Mässmogge are produced largely by hand in a complicated process. The candy mass, made of sugar, glucose and water, is warmed to 134 degrees Celsius, agitated in order to become airy and white, colored and folded into a striped, layered paste. The filling, consisting of roasted and ground hazelnuts with some fat and sugar, is then spread over the candy mass. The paste is wrapped into a roll, which is drawn out by a machine to a length of about , and separated into the individual Mässmogge. The whole process must take no more than 25 minutes, in order to keep the candy mass warm and malleable. History Candy canes were first introduced by French confectioners at Basel fairs in the 1860s, and sold in the form of thick candy lumps since about 1879. The confectioner Leonz Goldinger invented the current Mässmogge, with a hazelnut filling, at around 1900. At that time, the candies were produced directly at the fair and sold while still warm. Up until the 1960s, several confectioners produced Mässmogge for the Basel fairs. Because of the expense of producing the candy, the number of manufacturers has since dwindled to one, Sweet Basel AG.

Established on October 1, 1961, the medical school is officially affiliated to Dr. Kariadi Hospital the General Center Hospital in Central Java. In 2011, the medical school celebrated its 50 years of anniversary in giving contribution to the three basic goals of higher education which are medical education, research, and community services. Refer to the THES-QS Top World University Rankings in 2007, for the category of Life Science and Biomedicine, the medical school is ranked on 410th. History Since the Japanese occupancy in Semarang, there had been established a medical school, to provide the medical doctors. The medical school then sank with the ending of Japanese reign era. In 1955 Djojo-bojo Foundation (with members team Boentaran M.D., and Atmadi Wreksoatmodjo M.D.) had an aspiration about establishing a new medical school at Semarang. But this effort was not really successful because of lack coordination between Head of Health Inspection with the Director of Hospital and Head of Department Health Semarang due to the political parties and status at that time. Even though there was a Hospital Medical Center in Semarang, which was quite representative to be a teaching hospital of a medical school. In 1958, Heyder bin Heyder, M.D., and Soerarjo Darsono, M.D., met the Diponegoro University President, Mr. Soedarto, SH and delivered the idea of establishing a medical school, as Universitas Gadjah Mada medical students did their internship at Semarang General Hospital. Universitas Diponegoro Foundation was established in 1959, with Faculty of Law, Faculty of Economics and Business, Faculty of Teaching and Education, also Faculty of Engineering. This fact led to the new idea of establishing a medical school. During the Universitas Diponegoro Foundation meeting joint with the Universitas Diponegoro Senates on June 10, 1960, upon R. Atmadi Wreksoatmodjo M.D.’s idea, decided to establish a medical school of Universitas Diponegoro. Establishment of a medical school committee was formed. The chair-person was Suyono Atmo, and secretary is Sri Widojati Notoprodjo, SH. Technical Committee was also formed, headed by Colonel R. Soehardi, M.D., secretary Heyder bin Heyder, M.D., and members R. Kolonel, M.D., A. Soerojo, M.D., R. Marsaid S. Sastrodihardjo, M.D., Tjiam Tjwan Hok, M.D., and R. Soedjati, M.D. Since 1951, Semarang General Hospital Center was an affiliate teaching hospital for the internship of Universitas Gadjah Mada Medical School, especially Department of Child Health, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, also Department of Otolaryngology Head And Neck Surgery. Although the medical students examination was done in Yogyakarta, but at least the Semarang General Hospital was experienced in teaching medical students, especially in clinical internship. Technical committee on March 9, 1961 had a plenum, and the decisions are: Hospital director is appointed as the ex official Dean of Medicine, and begins to do the preparation, while Heyder bin Heyder, M.D., as the vice Dean of Medicine, and also secretary. Committee decides the Semarang General Hospital Medical Center is quite representative to be a teaching hospital. Committee approves the medical education curriculum of 6 years education proposed by Atmadi Wreksoatmodjo, M.D. Reckoning in the preclinical level education still needs time, the decision is still to open the higher level medical education. Information related to several senior medical students from Universitas Gadjah Mada Medical School who are ready to do exchange to Semarang On March 29, 1961, Heyder bin Heyder, M.D., and Soerarjo Darsono, M.D. met Prof. Soedjono Djoened Poesponegoro, Dean of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia Medical School, looking for suggestions and advice and assistance as the preparation to establish a medical school in Semarang. Prof. Soedjono recognized and understood the committee and local people's aspiration, agreed that would give assistance (lecturers) from Universitas Indonesia Medical School, and realized in 1963. There was a chairman change at Semarang General Hospital from Atmadi Wreksoatmodjo, M.D., to Soepaat Soemosoedirdjo, M.D., then on July 1, 1961, released the Universitas Diponegoro Presidential Decree No.782 C, about Soepaat Soemosoedihardjo, M.D. inauguration as the Dean of Medicine and Heyder bin Heyder, M.D., as the vice Dean of Medicine. Because Soepaat Soemosoedirdjo, M.D., who had just arrived from Klaten and had not recognized the procedural, Heyder bin Heyder, M.D. was assigned to carry out all activities. The preparations done by R. Soerarjo Darsono, M.D., and Heyder bin Heyder, M.D., had negotiation with chairpersons of Universitas Gadjah Mada Medical School Yogyakarta and higher medical students of UGM. On July 12, 1961, one delegation consists of Soedarto SH (President of Universitas Diponegoro Semarang), Heyder bin Heyder, M.D. (medical school secretary) and Soepaat Soemosoedirdjo (Hospital Director) met Minister of Education Prof. Iwa Koesoemasoemantri who agreed about the establishment of a medical school. Minister of Health, Prof. Satrio, M.D., agreed and suggested to give the Dean of Medicine position to an army due to Central Java condition at that time. Both Minister of Education and Minister of Health did not agree that the Dean of Medicine was also the Hospital Director.

He made his debut for the club in October 2000, aged 18, in a 2. Bundesliga match against FC St. Pauli, replacing Dino Toppmöller in a 2–2 draw. He made four more appearances during the 2000–01 season, but suffered an injury after just one game in the following season, and didn't play for FCS again, not featuring at all in his final year with the club, now relegated to the Regionalliga Süd. In 2000, he joined his hometown club, FC 08 Homburg of the Oberliga Südwest. He scored six goals in his first season with the club, but the next two years proved to be hugely successful – he scored 30 and 26 league goals respectively, both enough to make him the division's top scorer. This form earned Haas a move back up to the Regionalliga Süd, with ambitious TSG Hoffenheim, but in six months with the club he only made one appearance – a 1–1 draw with SV Elversberg in which he scored. In January 2007 he joined FK Pirmasens, where his four goals in eight appearances couldn't stop the club being relegated from the Regionalliga. After a further six months with Pirmasens, he was back in the Regionalliga, joining KSV Hessen Kassel. At the end of the season he returned to Saarland, spending two years with SV Elversberg before being released in July 2010. After six months out of the game, he returned to FC Homburg in January 2011. He scored four goals in seventeen appearances for the club, but was unable to prevent them being relegated from the Regionalliga West, so he left in summer 2011 and signed for local amateur side FC Palatia Limbach. A year later he signed for SC Halberg Brebach. In January 2013, Haas signed for SVN Zweibrücken, where he scored nineteen goals in seventeen appearances to help the club earn promotion to the Regionalliga Südwest.

It is based on the idea of Latin squares described by a Swiss mathematician and physicist Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in the 18th century. All Strimko puzzles are solvable with a pure logic; no special knowledge is required. Strimko uses only three basic elements: rows, columns, and streams. All elements have equal numbers of cells, and the goal is to make each row, column, and stream containing the whole set of specified numbers. Cells in the grid are organized into several streams of equal length, which often run diagonally and even branching. Such mechanics creates entangled patterns resulting in interesting challenges and unusual logic. Strimko challenges were handcrafted by Helen, Tanya, and Peter Grabarchuk, and hundreds of original Strimko puzzles were published in various forms and platforms: Web, iOS, PC/Mac, Kindle, paperback. Overview The goal of the game is to fully fill in the given grid (3x3, 4x4, 5x5 ...) with missing numbers observing three simple rules. Rule #1 Each row must contain different numbers. Rule #2 Each column must contain different numbers. Rule #3 Each stream must contain different numbers.

The church is located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as St. Peter's Church and Rectory. History St. Peter's Parish traces its roots to a group of German women who formed an organization in 1884 to raise money for a Catholic church to serve the German community of Council Bluffs. The organization collected 25 cents monthly from each member. At the time they belonged to the predominately Irish St. Francis Xavier Parish. with The German Catholic men organized themselves in 1886 in order to support the establishment of their own parish. Bishop Henry Cosgrove of the Diocese of Davenport, and the Rev. B.P. McMenony from St. Francis Xavier both approved of the plan. The parish was formed on April 25, 1887. It was served by Benedictine monks from St. Benedict's Abbey in Atchison, Kansas, as there was a shortage of German-speaking priests at that time in the Davenport diocese. Rock Island, Illinois architect Mathias Schnell designed the church, and Wickham Brothers of Council Bluffs was responsible for its construction. It was completed in 1887 for $11,126. The following year the men of the parish built a frame schoolhouse for the parochial school. By the end of 1888, a frame convent was built for the Benedictine Sisters who taught in the school. Both of these buildings were replaced in 1924 with a brick, combination school building and convent. The brick rectory next to the church was completed for the Benedictine priests in 1895. Wickham Brothers was also responsible for building the rectory. St. Peter's became a parish in the Diocese of Des Moines when it was formed in 1911. St. Peter's along with St. Mary's in Des Moines (no longer extant) were the only two ethnic parishes, meaning non-territorial, in the diocese. They both served German congregations. St. Peter's status as an ethnic parish ended in 1974 when Bishop Maurice Dingman merged it with St. Francis Xavier Parish. The St. Francis church building was taken down while the St. Peter's building was maintained for the merged parish. The clergy from the Des Moines diocese took over from the Benedictines in 1975. The church and rectory were placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 1992. Architecture The church building is a late 19th-century Gothic Revival structure. It features a symmetrical facade on the gable end and a central bell tower capped with a spire. The side elevations are six bays long and are divided by alternating buttresses and pilasters. Lancet windows are located in the center of each bay. The apsidal end of the church features three lancet windows located high in the walls. Brick corbeling is located at the cornice level. The only alteration to the exterior was the addition of a handicap entrance. The interior is divided in three naves, separated by columns. In 2001 the interior of the church was renovated and the statues and frescoes were embellished. A new parish hall was completed in 1999 and the office addition was completed in 2006. The rectory is a 2½-story, brick residential building. It features a full-size porch on the front, segmental arched windows, a lunette window and a corbelled brick frieze. Between the church and the rectory is an Our Lady of Grace shrine constructed by the Rev. J.J. Hannan, S.J. around 1958.

Constantine Beschi also called as Veeramamunivar. It is in Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu, India. History Once Konankuppam was a forest place, where people from Mugasaparur the nearby village brought their flocks for grazing. During the 17th century an Italian missionary, Fr. Beshi, brought two statues of Mother Mary to consecrate at Elakurichi (Thirukavalur), where he worked. Passing through the forest on the way to Elakurichi he felt tired, and fell asleep under a tree. Children who were looking after their cattle nearby playfully hid one of the statues behind a bush. Fr. Beshi was upset to discover that a statue was missing and went on sadly. Periya_Nayagi A childless man called Kachirayar lived in MugasaParur (M.Parur). One day a lady (Mother Mary) appeared to him in a dream. The lady called Kachirayar by name. She told him she was alone in the forest and asked him to find the statue and build a chapel at that place. If he did this, she said, he would be blessed with a child. Kachirayar searched for the statue and found it in a bush. With the help of villagers, he built a chapel on the spot. The miracle happened as he had dreamt: his wife gave birth to a child. Later Fr. Beshi happened to hear about the miracle, came to Konankuppam and saw the small chapel built for the Mother Mary statue he lost. He was very much delighted and decided to stay at Konankuppam while continuing his work in the Tamil. He constructed the shrine with the help of Kachirayar which exists today. It is said to have been the first place of worship he erected and when it was completed he went to Madras and asked the Bishop of Mylapore to procure for him a statue from Manila, an image of the Virgin in the native dress of Tamil Nadu and bearing the child Jesus in her arms, fashioned after a model he had made. The image eventually arrived and was set up in the church, were remains today. Fr_Beschi There is a life size statue of Fr. Beschi in the front of the church.

Because her fortune exceeded that of her spouse, he was by law required to grant her both the Tessin Palace as well as the Boo Manor as her dower. The marriage was childless. The Tessin's were leading members of the interest in amateur theater within the Swedish aristocracy which attracted the interest for theater that lay the foundation of the first professional Swedish language theater in Bollhuset in 1737.

Both she and her spouse became the favorites of Louisa Ulrika during her tenure as crown princess of Sweden, and belonged to her intimate circle of friends. Ulla Tessin was made a Dame of the L’Ordre de l’Harmonie, and Carl Gustaf Tessin became the political partner of Louisa Ulrika. When Frederick Adolph and Louisa Ulrika became king and queen of Sweden in 1751, Carl Gustaf Tessin was made royal governor of the royal children and Ulla Tessin succeeded Hedvig Elisabet Strömfelt as överhovmästarinna (mistress of the robes). In 1754, Carl Gustaf Tessin lost his favor with the queen and was dismissed from court. Ulla Tessin managed to distance herself from the fall of her spouse, waited for a while and then managed to resign from her office in favor of Ulrica Catharina Stromberg without losing the queen's favor.Tessin, 4. Ulrika (Ulla) Lovisa i Nordisk familjebok (andra upplagan, 1919) Soon, however, she also lost the favor of the queen, who deprived her of her pension. The Tessin couple lived their remaining life in retirement at their estate Åkerö Manor. =Later life= Ulla Tessin was described as intellectual and educated. Her spouse left the management of the household economy on her; he also supported her interest to study history and botany, and she collected a substantial library. In her correspondence, she expressed her frustration and anger over the passive role imposed on women when the laws and customs of society deprived her of most positions in society: \\"Does not men have their honor, their sword, their judge's caps, their politics, their horticulture etc? I have to admit I shrug to see something like the French Academy, assembled in full. A true usurpation, it should be composed entirely by women; but the beastly men usurp everything, is surprise me that they leave us the spindle and the sewing needle. Well, we must adjust, until it is our turn to write laws. Then we will have the opportunity to let them see the meaning of the right of the fittest.\\"Roger de Robelin Ett fruntimmers bibliotek från frihetstiden – Ulrika Lovisa Sparres boksamling på Åkerö år 1755 Legacy The correspondence between Ulla Tessin and Louisa Ulrika is kept at Riksarkivet, and letters to her husband and family are kept in the archives of Ericsberg Castle, Bergshammar and Börstorp Castle.

It was co-produced by ESPN and NBA Entertainment for ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The film chronicles the relationship of two basketball players from SFR Yugoslavia—Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dražen Petrović (Croatia). The duo played together on the Yugoslavia national basketball team from 1986 to 1990 and were at one time close friends, but the Yugoslav Wars drove them apart emotionally, as they came from opposing sides. Petrović died in an automobile accident in 1993 before the two could reconcile; much of film focuses on Divac's regret that they were never able to resolve their differences. Participants in the film include: Toni Kukoč, Dino Rađa, Žarko Paspalj, Clyde Drexler, Danny Ainge, Rick Adelman, Kenny Anderson, Derrick Coleman, Bill Fitch, Larry Bird, Jan Hubbard, Magic Johnson, Jerry West, Aleksandar Petrović, Biserka Petrović, etc. Release The film's first ever public showing took place on 10 October 2010 at the Hamptons International Film Festival. Two days later on 12 October it had its television premiere on ESPN. Following a theater run in the country, the film aired on Radio Television of Serbia's channel one in prime time on Thursday, 26 May 2011.Владе и Дражен, једном браћа;RTS, 25 May 2011 Reaction and critical reception =United States= Dan Devine of the Ball Don't Lie sports blog feels Once Brothers \\"is exactly the kind of presentation 30 for 30 was meant to produce—an enthralling recounting of a forgotten or underappreciated story about how sports and capital-letters Real Life interact\\" and sees its biggest asset, among many of them, to be \\"the honesty of Divac, Kukoč, and Rađa in discussing the emotional toll that the war took on them\\".BDL Review: 'Once Brothers';Ball Don't Lie, a Yahoo! sports blog, 12 October 2010 Michael Tully of hammertonail.com sees the film as \\"being about many different things at once—a history lesson, a touching interpersonal drama, and a positive reaffirmation that the American Dream still exists and isn't a completely silly construct\\" and labels it \\"a very strong work, in which the grand scope of the Yugoslav Wars of the early 1990s is personalized through the relationship—and unfortunate falling out—between former NBA stars Vlade Divac and Dražen Petrović\\".War Torn Court;hammertonail.com, 13 October 2010 Though mentioning the movie was \\"probably too long\\", objecting in particular to some of the childhood material about Vlade and Dražen as well as to lesser extent to some of Vlade's travelogue before he gets to Croatia being included in the film, Alan Sepinwall of HitFix still thinks it \\"did a nice job of telling the sad story of how politics tore apart that great Yugoslavian team, and the friendship between Divac and Petrovic\\".'30 for 30' – 'Once Brothers': Vlade and Drazen, together again;HitFix, 12 October 2010 Writing for the Slant Magazine blog, Jason Bellamy summarizes Once Brothers as an intimate tale that paints a vast panorama, but sees its long intro as necessary because \\"a good number of average [American] sports fans might not even remember Divac and Petrovic, and even many legitimate NBA fans are unlikely to know much about that duo's European careers, not to mention the outline of the war in the former Yugoslavia\\". He concludes by opining that \\"though not the absolute best film in the 30 for 30 series, Once Brothers might be the film that best encapsulates the kind of personal, outside-the-mainstream storytelling that characterizes the series as a whole\\".The Ties That Bind: Once Brothers;Slant Magazine blog, 12 October 2010The Ties That Bind: Once Brothers;Slant Magazine blog, 12 October 2010 David Cassilo on the SLAM Magazine blog described the film as mainly being Divac's story about dealing with the division that comes between him (a Serb) and all of the Croats that were once his teammates on the Yugoslavian national team, praising it as a must-see for any NBA fan because \\"within the main story is the story of how an international player adjusts to the NBA. Divac and his former Yugoslavian teammates express all of the obstacles that are in the way for a foreign-born player, including style of play, language and the lack of belief by others that they could actually cut it in the NBA\\".Movie Review: Once Brothers;SLAM, 10 October 2010 Writing for The A.V. Club, Scott Tobias had mixed feelings about the movie: \\"For all its earnestness and nobility, Once Brothers is still very much an NBA Entertainment production, following Divac's 'journey' to a conclusion that's as disappointingly precooked as a VH-1 Behind The Music special\\". He continues by saying the film has a great story, but that it's also \\"framed in a contrived way with Divac telling us that his eldest son, an 18-year-old, wants to know what life was like when he was his age, and so into the Wayback Machine we go\\". Tobias also pontificates on Petrović's decision to sever his friendship with Divac and presents two reasons—the one that, like Kukoč and Rađa, Petrović was also afraid of the reaction back home in Croatia if he continued to associate with Divac and the other that he was genuinely offended by Divac's actions with the Croatian flag while maybe having a cause to disbelieve Divac's explanation about doing it out of loyalty to a unified Yugoslavia as both equally likely, before concluding that because Petrović isn't around to tell his side of the story, \\"Once Brothers does feel a little unbalanced and self-serving, which is not to say Divac is being disingenuous\\". Tobias ends by saying the scene with Divac walking through Zagreb is the best one in the entire movie, but that it also has a problem of being \\"just another step in Divac's scripted road to reconciliation, which ends predictably with a casual conversation with Petrovic's mother and a visit to his friend's grave\\", before concluding that \\"Once Brothers has some moving scenes despite itself, but the whole production feels as spontaneous as a frozen pizza—just heat and serve\\".Once Brothers;The A.V. Club, 12 October 2010 =Croatia= Vlade Divac and Dražen Petrović playing for Yugoslavia at the 1990 FIBA World Championship in Argentina. Croatian media generally complained over Stojko Vranković's (another Petrović's close friend, who, unlike Divac, was in constant contact with him throughout 1991, 1992, and 1993) omission from the documentary. It also pointed out several factual inaccuracies in the film such as the claim that this was Divac's first time visiting Zagreb and Croatia since the war when in fact he had already been there in September 2008 at which time he visited the Dražen Petrović Museum. The reaction to the film from those in Croatia with personal ties to the topic was mixed. Vranković, who suited up for Yugoslavia in four major competitions (all four with both Divac and Petrović as teammates) and whose two seasons in the NBA overlapped with both players' time in the league, did not watch the movie. However, after having it summarized for him by Croatian journalists, he mentioned several details from the 1991–1992 period, which he claims ultimately led to Petrović severing his friendship with Divac. Vranković specifically talked about having Divac and his wife Snežana over to his house in Boston in October 1991 (during NBA preseason when Divac's Los Angeles Lakers came to play his Boston Celtics) where they discussed Divac's flag incident from Argentina long into the night. Divac then left for Paris with the Lakers to play at the McDonald's Open where he was reportedly asked by Spanish newspaper As about the Yugoslav national team's appearance at the upcoming 1992 Olympics in light of Vranković's and Petrović's statements that they want to play for Croatia. According to Vranković, Divac's response included a feeling the Yugoslav team will stay together and a surprise at Vranković's and Petrović's statements about wanting to play for Croatia since that country doesn't even exist, all of which Vranković and Petrović didn't appreciate when they saw it. Still, Vranković claims that the ultimate falling out between Petrović and Divac happened on 4 March 1992, when the Nets came to play the Lakers at The Forum in Los Angeles: \\"Dražen later told me about taking issue with something Divac did in that game. Following a matchup versus Divac, Dražen fell on the floor expecting a foul and Divac stepped on him. That was the end in Dražen's eyes\\". Zdravko Radulović, who participated in two major competitions with the Yugoslav national team, 1988 Olympics in Seoul and EuroBasket 1989 in Zagreb, with Divac and Petrović on the roster both times, said: \\"It was a good documentary. I know Divac and I think he was very honest and truthful about the things he said in the movie. While we were in the national team, their relationship wasn't all that close. To all of us on those national team rosters, Dražen, who was a bit older and had already been playing abroad in Real Madrid, was an idol. I believe the two of them became close friends once they both went to the NBA at the same time in 1989 because being together made coping with life in the new world easier\\". On the other hand, Franjo Arapović, who also represented Yugoslavia in two major competitions—1986 FIBA World Championship and 1988 Olympics, both times sharing a roster with Petrović and Divac—had a strongly negative reaction to the film, dismissing it as \\"pure propaganda\\" and questioning its truthfulness by claiming \\"90% of the movie is a pure lie\\". Though confirming the national team functioned like a family, he also disputed the friendship and closeness between Petrović and Divac: \\"Stojko Vranković was Dražen's best friend. Dražen had nothing with Divac\\". Zoran Čutura, a four- time participant in major competitions with Yugoslavia (three of those coming with both Divac and Petrović) refused to watch the movie, opining that it's \\"pointless, needless, and meaningless\\": \\"Personal friendships and internal relations within a sports team are a category that's very difficult to grasp and understand for an outsider, and I see no point in trying to explain them rationally. I'm not sure about the credibility of a portrayal of a relationship between two guys in a sports team, especially when one of them is very much dead while the other one is very much alive. Many things happened in the calendar of our lives since then, and explaining player relations, chemistry and circumstances that this team, which was unique in every way, functioned in is lacking common decency, especially when it's done from an American perspective\\". Some of the reaction to the film in Croatia, primarily that by Franjo Arapović as well as to a lesser extent by Stojko Vranković, prompted media outlets to further inquire with Dražen Petrović's brother Aleksandar, also a professional basketball player who represented Yugoslavia at four competitions (two of those with both Divac and Dražen on the team), about the extent of the relationship his brother had with Divac. He said: \\"When two basketball masters spend five years in a national team as roommates it is very logical for them to become close friends. Dražen and Vlade were great friends and I was a first-hand witness to this in 1986 and 1987 when I played with them on the national team. Now, I believe Stojko Vranković's comments were in reaction to the claim that my late brother and Divac were 'best friends'. Vranković knows Dražen since they were little kids and he was very shaken up over my brother's death. All the other things are nonsense that's not worth commenting on. Dražen and Divac were most definitely good friends who shared secrets, joy, despair, fame... everything. Both on and off the court. They kept in telephone contact when they were in the NBA\\". Reaction to the film in Croatia continued well after its premiere. In late October 2016, on the occasion of 52nd anniversary of Petrović's birth, Jutarnji list interviewed his close childhood friend and former KK Šibenka teammate Fabijan Žurić who brought up the movie: \\"Dražen had four close friends — myself, my brother Dubravko Žurić, Denis Erceg, and Stojko Vranković. And that's it. Everyone else trying to claim him is lying, and same goes for Divac's movie because it was only us who were Dražen's true friends and if we were to make a film it would be called Always Brothers, not Once Brothers. That movie got made and got praised, but a lot of it isn't true. Just one of many things in it that are not accurate is the whole flag thing. That wasn't why they got driven apart — that was just the story for the newspapers. The real reason they fell out was the game during which they had a hustle situation going after a loose ball, Dražen fell on the floor and Divac stomped on him with his shoe. Dražen retaliated by cursing him out severely and that's how their \\"great\\" friendship ended. That was never a great friendship to begin with and the flag incident was never a problem between them. All of this is hurtful to us [Dražen's actual close friends] because Divac is continually being presented as Dražen's great friend, which isn't true\\".

Opened by the Irish entrepreneur Peter Langan on 20 October 1976 in partnership with the actor Michael Caine, the Brasserie (which had previously housed the ornate restaurant Le Coq d'Or) quickly attracted celebrities and became hugely successful. Langan's Brasserie remains one of the most popular restaurants in London today. The background music was live jazz supplied by 'Bernie and the Vibes' Bernie Bloom also played piano late night. This lasted 34 years or more. Beryl Cook painted the band. Painting called 'Bernie and the Vibes' History Langan's Brasserie interior Peter Langan (who gave his name to the Brasserie) was born in Ireland in 1941. After moving to England in the early 1960s, Langan began his catering career working at Odin's restaurant at 26 Devonshire Street. Langan had been lodging nearby to Odin's and when the proprietor, James Benson, was killed in an accident in 1966, he took over the kitchen for Benson's wife, Kirsten. Langan transformed Odin's in both its style of cuisine and its decor. Patrick Procktor, an artist who lived near and later married Kirsten Benson, provided a number of watercolours to hang on the walls of Odin's alongside the works of other artists encouraged to 'eat down' their work. After purchasing Benson's share of Odin's, Langan created a larger Odin's at the premises next door in Devonshire Street. Opening early in 1973, the larger Odin's maintained the tradition of serving hearty cuisine in an environment surrounded by original artworks. Odin's quickly became a very popular dining location and proved profitable enough to permit Langan to embark on what became his most successful venture, Langan's Brasserie. Peter Langan wanted to bring Parisienne cafe society to London and chose the former site of Le Coq d'Or restaurant in Stratton Street, Mayfair as its location. Michael Caine, a customer and friend of Peter Langan, became his business partner and the pair transformed the site with original artwork, brighter lighting with mis-matched lamps and relaxed the atmosphere of the restaurant (there was no dress code for diners). Richard Shepherd, the former head chef at the Michelin starred Capital Hotel in London, joined the Caine and Langan partnership in 1977 and introduced a menu that has changed little since. By the mid-1980s Langan's had become London's most fashionable haunt for stars as diverse as Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Mick Jagger, Francis Bacon, Muhammad Ali, Jack Nicholson, and David Hockney. The restaurateur Chris Corbin was an early manager of the Brasserie. A notorious alcoholic, Peter Langan died at the age of 47 on 7 December 1988, several weeks after a fire at his home in Essex which he is alleged to have started himself. Langan's name was retained by the restaurant and Richard Shepherd subsequently bought Michael Caine's share of the company to become the sole owner of Langan's Brasserie and the group's other restaurants. Langan's Brasserie is particularly noted for its artwork. Its walls are adorned with works by artists such as David Hockney (who also designed the menu), Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon, Gerald Moira and Patrick Procktor. Upstairs at the Brasserie, is a room known as 'The Venetian Room' which featured murals by Patrick Procktor specially commissioned by Peter Langan. Other Langan's restaurants The Langan's brand has been expanded to include: Odin's Bar & Bistro (a restaurant acquired by Langan in 1967) which are next door to each other in Devonshire Street in Marylebone but closed in March 2013 and Shepherd's Bar & Bistro in Marsham Court, Westminster, which was opened in 1993. He also collaborated with Karen Jones and Roger Myers who 'did' three restaurants with Langan, each called Langan's Bar and Grill, in the city, Mayfair and Hampton Court. Two years later they sold Theme Holdings. Previously, the Langan's chain had included another Langan's Bistro in Paston Place, Brighton but this has since closed. Another Langan's Brasserie was opened in 1986 by Peter Langan in Coggeshall, Essex, near his home. After Langan's death in 1988, the Head Chef of the restaurant, Mark Baumann adopted the restaurant. In July 1998, Richard Shepherd opened Langan's Coq d'Or on Old Brompton Road in Earls Court, which is now operating as Rocca restaurant.

He found that athletes in risky sports such as these have superior intelligence, emotional stability, and independence compared to those who did not participate in such sports. Ogilvie also determined that athletes in risky sports make concerted efforts to minimize their risks. Ogilvie also found that these athletes shared certain traits. For example, race car drivers were very driven and need to be in control. Drivers are also abnormally sexually active, perhaps to help cope with the stress of their sport.BIBLIOGRAPHIC CITATION: Cheng Wee, Teo. LexisNexis. The Strait Times (Singapore), 08/24/04.

He found that watching sports uses many psychological and social skills and that men exude an extreme amount of testosterone while watching sports. Ogilvie says that attending a sporting event serves as a fantasy escape for people and can be a form of hero modeling.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. History The parish was begun on May 27, 1855, and it was incorporated in August 1857. A lot was bought for a church on South Market Street, the location of the Oskaloosa Public Library, but it was exchanged for the corner lot at First Ave East and South Third Street. A Gothic Revival style church and a rectory were built on the property in 1869 for $12,000. It was a frame structure that measured , and it was consecrated on November 20, 1870. The church building was moved to the back of the property in 1896 in preparation for the construction of the present church in 1900. Frank E. Wetherell, a parishioner, designed the Late Gothic Revival style building. It was built of brick with a bell tower by Henry Wetherell for $20,000. The new church was consecrated on February 2, 1902. The old church is attached to the south side of the new church, and it is veneered in brick. with The congregation worshiped without an organ until 1920 when $2,500 was raised to purchase one. The tower holds 10 bells that were given by Alice Williams Bennett in memory of her parents Micajah and Virginia Williams. The tower was severely damaged by lighting in 1927 and had to be rebuilt. The church's interior features an oak carved altar, lectern, pulpit, rood screen, and altar rail. Stained glass windows line the east and west walls. The original frame church was renovated in the 1950s for classrooms, office space, and a children's chapel. In 1985 a pipe organ, which had been built for a church in Bloomer, Wisconsin in 1930, was purchased a rebuilt in the church. It contains 1,126 pipes. A new oak altar was built in 1993 so the priest can face the congregation during the service. It was consecrated on March 29, 1994. The original church was remodeled again in 2001 to create a new fellowship hall. While it was air-conditioned at the time the rest of the church building was air-conditioned in 2004.

The album was both inspired and funded by Petit’s time spent performing as part of the Licensed Busking scheme on the London Underground in 2003. Speaking to EarlyBlues.com, Petit commented: \\"It was hard but ultimately it led to me recording Guitararama. People stopped me down there and said \\"Can I buy this?\\" but I had nothing to sell so after a few months I thought I’d better set about recording some music.\\" Guitararama was recorded over an 18 month period and financed entirely by busking. It was released independently by Petit in late 2006. The album's first pressing was initially available only on the London Underground before being taken on by major UK commercial retailers and online outlets. Guitararama was re-packaged and re-released on 2 June 2008 under 333 Records, with 3 extra bonus tracks added (\\"Blues Fom Mars\\", \\"Bad Road Blues\\" and \\"A Better Answer\\"). The album is in a Digipak format with a 16-page colour booklet featuring photography from street photographer John Gladdy. Concept and influences Guitararama is predominantly instrumental and appeals to \\"both the mature, arts-appreciative audience and the younger, guitar-inquisitive end of the market.\\" Petit states that in creating the album, his \\"guiding principle was to honour the music that had floored me throughout my life, to do it justice, to try and create the magic, mystery and excitement I’d heard in that music in my own songs and to capture it in the recordings\\". Reception Classic Rock reviewed the album, giving it eight stars and stating: \\"Petit occupies a stunning middle ground between the fire of Freddie King, the instinct of Jimmy Page and the soul of Clapton… It’s difficult these days to put a new spin on such an old genre as the blues but Petit has managed it\\". Guitar & Bass Magazine placed Guitararama in its \\"Top 10 Albums of the Year\\", writing that \\"Petit’s vim and vigour are matched by his fine technical skills... proof positive that the blues can move forward in the 21st Century.\\" Properganda Magazine praised the album for Petit’s \\"incendiary playing\\" and described Petit as a \\"a phenomenal technician who demonstrates tremendous feel.\\" Commenting on Petit’s performance on Guitararama, Rock N Reel Magazine said: \\"Petit's got that elusive must see quality that makes a minor deities of accomplished musicians\\". The first incarnation of Guitararama entered the Top 10 HMV Blues Album Chart in the UK (between two Robert Johnson albums), as well as the iTunes Top 10 Chart in both Norway and Sweden.

History of the Globe  The globe started life as the Palais de l'Equilibre at Expo.02 in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. It was designed by Geneva architects, Hervé Dessimoz and Thomas Büchi, as a model of sustainable building. It is high and in diameter, roughly the size of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The globe consists of two concentric spheres nested within one another, made up of five different types of timber: Scotch pine, Douglas pine, spruce, larch, and Canadian maple. The outer shell is composed of wooden slats, and two ramps run between the two spheres, allowing visitors to see out. The inner sphere is made of 18 wooden arches, covered by wooden panels; this forms the walls of the globe's interior. This construction model enables the globe to act as a natural carbon sink. After Expo.02 was closed, the Swiss Confederation donated the Palais de l'Equilibre to CERN, and it was renamed the Globe of Science and Innovation. It was moved and re-opened in 2004, in time for the 50th anniversary of CERN. In 2010, the globe was renovated and its new, permanent exhibit, Universe of Particles, was opened.

It has been a poor area since colonial times, but the modern colonia was not established until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although the area has been the setting for a number of literary works and films, today the area is known for violence and crime, especially shootings and the selling of stolen auto parts. Description The boundaries of the colonia are formed by the following streets: Juventino Rosas to the south, Avenida Río Consulado to the north, Calzada de Guadalupe to the east and Avenida Insurgentes Norte to the west. It has been a poor area since early colonial times. Many of the streets here are named for Mexican and international musicians, a change which was done early in the colonia's history to unify it. However, there are exceptions where the names are simply numbers or others such as Avenida Ferrocarril de Cintura. There are a total of 27 blocks. There are a number of private and public schools in the colonia such as 30 de Septiembre Primary (public), Carlos Darwin Primary (private), Cendi DIF Republica Española Technical School (public), Chris Pre school (private), Colegio Carolingio Primary (private), Estado de Michoacan Pre school (public), Galacion Gomez Pre school (public), La Patita Pre school (private), Leonardo Bravo Primary (public), Leopoldo Rio de la Loza Secondary (public), Lisandro Calderon Primary (public), Luces de Mexico Primary (private) and Luis de Camoens Secondary (public). The area has a reputation for crime and has been the scene of a number of violent robberies and murders. In 2006, 25,000 pesos was robbed from a secondary school cooperative after a shootout with police in the streets of the colonia as the robbers tried to escape. In 2008, the third highest ranking police official in Mexico City, Hugo Moneda Range, was shot to death on the intersection of Calzada de los Misterios and Berlioz. In 2004, the Agencia Federal de Investigación, conducted raids in Peralvillo and other areas of the city to shut down establishments making illegal slot machines and illegally operating casinos. However, the major business in the area is the black market in autoparts. This business began in the late 1980s, when only twelve businesses selling used autoparts existed, and has expanded to over 9,000, with 90 to 95% of these selling stolen parts. Making Colonia Peralvillo and neighboring Colonia Hipodromo de Peralvillo one of the city's major areas for chop shops. However, genuine used auto parts, whether obtained illegally or not, are facing pressure from imitation parts made in Taiwan and other parts of Asia. This is making the stealing of automobiles less profitable. An abandoned green area near where Paseo de la Reforma, Calzada Misterios and Eje 2 Norte converge was cleaned up and rehabilitated to become the site of a 3.8-meter tall statue of the wrestler El Santo, by sculptor Edwin Barrera. The statue was sponsored by the wrestler's son, who is known as the Hijo del Santo. It was placed here because the wrestler lived near here on Belisario Dominguez Street with his siblings to fight in the nearby Arena Coliseo in the city center. History In the 16th century, the area was not part of Mexico City, but rather a geographic area known as the Llanos de Peralvillo (Plains of Peralvillo). It was an area with many inns and other services for travelers entering Mexico City from the north. It also had a customs gate called the Garita de Peralvillo. This colonia, along with neighboring Tepito, Lagunilla and Tlatelolco were areas mostly inhabited by indigenous and mestizos, both poor, as well as large haciendas and monasteries during the colonial period. Much of these lands, especially ecclesiastical lands, were expropriated by Benito Juárez in the latter 19th century and redistributed among the poor living here. The modern colonia began when Carlos David de Gheest petitioned to have his lands, now known as the San José or Los Cuartos de la Cuchilla del Fraile areas, subdivided into housing in 1889. In 1910, the Terrenos de Peralvillo Company did the same with two other lots of land, which completed the current perimeter of the colonia. The area has always been called Peralvillo but the origin of the name is not clear. One writer, Gonzalo Peredo Goméz states that the name comes from a passage in the work Don Quixote, but spelled \\"Perabillo,\\" which referred to a place in La Mancha. The area has been used as a setting in a number of literary works such La Marchanta by José Martínez de la Vega and screenplays by Juan García, who used the pseudonym \\"El Peralvillo.\\" One film set here is Los Fernández de Peralvillo (1953), which won five Ariel Awards. In 2000, residents of the colonia burned in effigy the three presidential candidates (Vicente Fox, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas and Francisco Labastida) on Wagner Plaza. This was done after the three were ceremoniously convicted of using \\"the money of the people\\" for their presidential campaigns. This protest occurred during the annual ritual of the burning of a large cardboard and paper effigy of Judas Iscariot. Started in the mid-2000s, the La Casa de Todos association operates a pizzeria and bakery that employs street children. These young people can often been seen in the colonia selling candy and other items in order to survive. The goal of the association is to give these young people steady employment and job skills. The operation is small, mostly selling to those in the colonia, but it hopes to get contracts to provide bread and other foods to hospitals and prisons.

It crashed on approach to Hercílio Luz International Airport. Only three of the 58 people on board survived.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was a Boeing 727-27C, registration PT-TYS. It had first flown on August 14, 1966. It was delivered to Braniff Airways, which leased it to Transbrasil in 1975, and sold it to Transbrasil in 1976.  Crash  Beginning on the morning of April 12, the flight was scheduled to fly from Belém to Porto Alegre, with stops in Fortaleza, Brasília, Vitória, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Curitiba and Florianópolis. After taking off from Belém and performing most of its stopovers, Flight 303 took off from Congonhas Airport in the early evening bound for Florianopolis, the last stopover before the final destination of the flight, Porto Alegre. The aircraft was on a night instrument approach to Hercílio Luz International Airport in a severe thunderstorm. After reaching Florianópolis' non-directional beacon (NDB), located near the Hercílio Luz bridge, the Boeing 727 descended from 3,000 to 2,000 feet and began its landing approach. Around 20:38, the aircraft went off course, struck the north side of the hill Morro da Virgínia, and exploded. The crash site was in the town of Ratones, about 24 km north of Florianópolis airport. The heavy impact of the aircraft with the existing trees in the area caused the fuselage to be completely destroyed, throwing some of the passengers out, including a few survivors. The crash site was difficult to reach. The rescue teams only reached the site at around 10pm, an hour and a half after the crash. As one team rescued four survivors, another opened a clearing in the woods to allow a helicopter to land. During the night, the four survivors were removed by helicopter to hospitals in Florianópolis while the bodies of the passengers and dead crew were gathered to be transported to the Instituto Médico Legal. On the morning of April 13, authorities had to block hundreds of people attempting to invade the crash site. Some time later, one of the survivors died, reducing the number of survivors to three.  Investigation  The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR) were found and recovered on April 14. The analysis of the recorders did not indicate an abnormality in the aircraft. Probable causes were misjudgment of speed and distance, inadequate flight supervision, failure to initiate a go-around, and improper operation of the engines. The aircraft was piloted by an inspector from the Civil Aviation Department, who was training for the Boeing 727's supervisory role. The training was overseen by the commander of the aircraft. The bad weather caused delay in the flight and the incidence of lightning hampered the operation of the NDB of Florianópolis, generating a false block of position, that prejudged the judgment of the crew. The crew's overconfidence of their geographic position prevented the approach being done from being aborted. When approaching the landing in an incorrect location (caused by the false NDB readings), the aircraft flew below the safety limit of that region, about 60 m high, and collided with Morro da Virgínia, hitting the trees until it reached the north side of the hill. The lack of modern navigational aids at the Florianopolis airport also contributed to the accident, since unlike the major airports of the time using the VOR and ILS / DME systems, Florianópolis airport used the obsolete NDB as the only aid to navigation.  Consequences  After the accident, the Brazilian Air Force accelerated the implementation of CINDACTA II in November 1982, while Infraero implemented, between July 1981 and April 1982, a new navigation aid system at the Hercílio Luz airport, consisting of radar, ILS/DME, and VOR while the obsolete NDB equipment was disabled. Transbrasil was experiencing a serious financial crisis since 1975, being aggravated by the accident and by incidents, threats of strikes, layoffs, etc. In order not to fail (in mid-1987, Transbrasil had a debt of about US$120 million), the airline accepted to receive large financial contributions from the Brazilian government that came to intervene in the direction of the company between 1988 and 1989. After poor management, Transbrasil ceased operations in 2001, leaving a debt of about R$1.5 billion.

The stated mission of the NIMHD is to “lead scientific research to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities.” The mission of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities is aimed at a wide variety of people whether the disparity is caused by gender, age, economic status, ethnicity, or residential location. In any case, if a person is assumed to be part of a minority group, then there is a risk for health disparities to form. Minority Health relates to people that are socially categorized into minority groups because they do not hold positions of power in our society. Health disparities refer to rates of illness and disease that are disproportionate within a society. Health disparities have been a subject of interest great enough to inspire the creating and implementation of programs like NIMHD and Health Disparities Centers. Similar to the mission of NIMDHD, Health Disparities Centers focus on addressing needs that are in high demand for minority groups, and encouraging the delivery of adequate health care to groups that are not represented well. By the passage of the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act, NIMHD was established in 2000 as an NIH center with the initial title of National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD).

Thought to be ordered by Osama bin Laden himself the plot led to an unprecedented increase in Drone attacks in Pakistan and travel advisories from several countries to their citizens to be careful while traveling in Europe. Plot The existence of the plot was revealed by several media sources including Sky News on 28 September 2010. Intelligence officials stated that the plot was ordered by Osama bin Laden himself. The plan was to launch attacks similar to the 2008 Mumbai attacks. It was discovered and disrupted by the combined efforts of the security services of the United States, UK, Germany and France. According to Der Spiegel, the first information came from a 36-year-old German man from Hamburg identified as Ahmad Siddiqui, who was detained by authorities in July, 2010, while attempting to fly from Kabul to Europe. He was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and had trained in Pakistan, where he was sheltered by the Haqqani network. Currently he is in custody of NATO at the Bagram Airfield.\\"Al Qaeda plot in Europe possibly revealed by German terror suspect; The Al Qaeda plot was reportedly a coordinated Mumbai-style attack on major cities in the UK, France, Germany, and possibly the United States,\\" Tom A.

German authorities have closed the mosque. According to German intelligence officials, in early 2009, Sidiqi and 10 others left Hamburg for the tribal areas of Pakistan where 8 of them joined the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). One member of the group was Rami Makanesi, 25, a German citizen of Syrian descent. Another was Shahab Dashti, a German citizen of Iranian descent. He appeared in an IMU video in late 2009. Wielding a knife and gun, he urged other Germans to join in jihad against U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Several other Germans in the video were shown firing weapons in what appeared to be live-fire exercises. Several scenes featured what appeared to be the group's members using rockets and guns to practice storming enemy positions, learning the type of combat skills that Western counter-terrorism officials fear could be used in Western cities in an attack similar to 2008 Mumbai attacks. One European counterterrorism official said Sidiqi told his interrogators that Naamen Meziche, a French citizen of Algerian descent had assumed a planning role in the terrorist plot which Osama Bin Laden himself approved. Pakistan officials captured Naamen Meziche in a raid near the border with Iran sometime in the middle of June 2012. On 3 October 2010, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a joint bulletin warning that terror attacks were being plotted against targets in Europe. German officials said the Hamburg group members were recruited from the Taiba mosque in Hamburg. In the 1990s, that same mosque - then called Al Quds - was attended by Mohamed Atta, who went on to become the lead hijacker in the 9/11 attacks. Hamburg authorities shut the mosque a few weeks after Sidiqi was arrested since they said the mosque had become a recruiting center for jihadists across Europe. On 4 October 2010 a U.S. drone fired a missile at a building in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan and killed 11 suspected militants believed to be members of Jihad al Islami. Pakistani intelligence officials confirmed on the next day that five German nationals were among them, as well as three other foreigners whose nationalities were not disclosed. The rest were Pakistanis. A Pakistani intelligence official confirmed that 8 Germans and 2 British brothers were central players in the plot. They were hiding in North Waziristan and were being tracked by Pakistan, Germany, and the UK. A Briton of Pakistani origin named Abdul Jabbar, originally from Jhelum District, suspected of being involved in this plot was killed in a drone strike according to Pakistani officials. He was allegedly being groomed to be the leader of Al-Qaeda group in the UK charged with attacking targets in Europe. According to Pakistani intelligence dozens of Islamic militants with European citizenship, many of Pakistani origin, were hiding in the tribal areas of Pakistan along the Afghan border and plotting attacks in Europe. British Government Communications Headquarters estimates that about 20 Britons are getting training in North Waziristan. Siddiqui indicated that Younis al-Mauretani was his al-Qaeda contact. In early September 2011 in Quetta, al-Mauretani was arrested by the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence with Frontier Corps Balochistan and assistance from U.S. intelligence.Top al Qaeda leader arrested in Pakistan, CNN, September 5, 2011 Response On a visit to Pakistan soon after the plot was uncovered CIA director Leon Panetta demanded full co-operation by Pakistani authorities in neutralizing the plot. =Drone strikes= The United States responded with an increase of drone attacks on the Waziristan region of Pakistan.\\"CIA acts on fear of al-Qaeda plot to hit in Europe,\\" Greg Miller, September 29, 2010, Washington Post. In September 2010, 22 drone strikes were carried out, most in a month since the attacks began. On October 4, 2010 a strike killed up to 8 German nationals suspected to be part of this plot. A U.S. official explained that security agencies have had \\"to work backwards, with your starting point being individuals you believe are involved in plotting, even when you don't have the full outlines of the plot itself... That's why we have been striking - with precision - people and facilities that are part of these conspiracies.\\" =Travel advisories= The U.S. government issued an advisory asking that citizens \\"take every precaution to be aware of their surroundings and to adopt appropriate safety measures to protect themselves when traveling\\" to or within Europe in response to this plot.

Canada urged its citizens to exercise caution when traveling in Europe. However, the Canadian government has not changed or upgraded its official travel advisories. In an unusual move Japan also issued a travel alert warning its citizens of the risks of a terrorist attack in Europe.

The church is located in Guttenberg, Iowa, United States. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. Mary's Catholic Church Historic District. In addition to the church, the historic district includes the parish rectory, convent, and school building. History Rectory The parish was established in 1851. The parish's first church building was a frame structure built in 1851 on the north side of town. with A brick church was constructed two years later and the original frame church was converted into a school. Plans to replace it began in 1865, but disagreements about where to build it doomed the effort. Eventually, it was decided to relocate the parish property and a new stone church was completed in 1874. The Rev. Joseph Brinkman became the pastor in 1889. He had been instrumental in the construction of the Basilica of St. Francis Xavier in Dyersville, Iowa. Brinkman designed a new school (1894), rectory (1899), and the present church (1904). Parishioners had determined that the school building was too small. The Colonial Revival structure was completed for $8,000, and the old school building was converted into a convent. Soon after the roof of the frame rectory started to deteriorate and it had other problems. A building committee of parishioners decided not to waste money on the old house. The new residence was completed for $3,500. It is a two-story, brick Colonial Revival structure with Italianate influences. The old rectory was moved to a different lot in town. Complaints about lack of space in church went back as far as 1892. Brinkman suggested adding a side wing onto the 1874 structure, but the parishioners decided a new church was feasible. Groundbreaking took place in 1902 and the church was completed in 1904. The lack of architect fees was a huge savings to the parish in their desire to expand their parish plant. In 1921 a wing was added to the south side of the school building to house, not only increased enrollment, but an expansion to ten grades. Brinkman had planned to build a new convent to replace the aging former school building the Franciscan Sisters continued to occupy, but he died unexpectedly on October 11, 1925. His successor, the Rev. Joseph A. Dupont, set to work immediately to provide an adequate home for the Sisters. This time a trained architect, Carimir Ignatius Krajewski from Dubuque, was chosen to design the new $13,545 Tudor Revival residence that was completed in 1926. The old convent was torn down. In 1961 a new school building, used in addition to the old school building, was built on the site of the old convent. The high school department was discontinued in 1968, and the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration ended their 98 years of service to the parish that same year. The grade school was consolidated with Immaculate Conception School in North Buena Vista, also in 1968. Architecture Convent The church is a Gothic Revival, cross-shaped structure that features twin spires, which flank a tripartite entrance portal. It was originally designed to be built of sandstone. After the stone foundation was completed it was decided to build the structure with bricks that were manufactured in St. Louis, Missouri. The church's dimensions are: long, wide, and at the transept. The church can seat 800 people. The bell towers are high and rise well above any other structure in town. School St. Mary's Catholic School building The church hosts the St. Mary's Catholic School. The school opened in 1853, and it received a two story facility in 1860. In 1894 the current building was constructed at a cost of $5000. Initially a grade school, it received a high school section which had its building constructed in 1921 and in 1925 received accreditation. In 1968, Immaculate Conception School in North Buena Vista merged into St. Mary's and the high school closed.

Born in Berlin, Erich Werdermann was the son of the landowner Carl Werdermann. He first studied in Jena, but then switched to Friedrich Wilhelm University (now called Humboldt University of Berlin) in Berlin. In 1914 shortly before his graduation, Werdermann was enlisted in the army and in 1915 promoted to the rank of officer. After recovering from serious wounds suffered in 1918, he was able to continue his studies. The following year Werdermann graduated as a plant physiologist at Gottlieb Haberlandt. From 1919 to 1920 he worked at the Imperial Biological Institute in Berlin, where Peter Claussen (1877–1959) sparked his interest in fungi. From 1920 to 1921, Mann was a research assistant at the Imperial Health Office with Ernst Friedrich Gilg, who introduced him to the Botanical Museum Berlin- Dahlem. In 1921, he succeeded Rudolf Schlechter as the curator of mushrooms in the herbarium of the museum. In 1923 Werdermann began a four-year research trip to Chile and neighboring countries. After his return he succeeded Friedrich Vaupel as curator of the Botanical Garden and took care of cacti and other succulents in the herbarium. He was in charge of the scientific reviews of the stocks in the greenhouses of the Botanical Garden. In 1927 he was elected as President of the German Cactus Society, a position he held until 1934. Werdermann traveled to Madrid to see the collections of Hipólito Ruiz López and José Antonio Pavón Jiménez. In 1929, he married Hildegard Hauser. In 1930 Werdermann published his work in 42 parts along with his own color photographs on Blooming cacti and other succulent plants. He made a trip of the North East of Brazil in 1932. In 1933 he accepted an invitation from the Huntington Botanical Gardens in Los Angeles. Prior to his stay there he traveled from March to May to Mexico, Texas and Arizona. After completing his studies in Los Angeles, he returned in late October to Mexico. During World War II his scientific library and collection in the botanical garden on 1 March 1943 was destroyed. After the war, Werdermann dedicated the reconstruction of the botanical garden and greenhouses. In 1948 he gave lectures and practical courses of pharmacognosy at the newly founded Free University of Berlin. In 1950 he was among the participants of the 7th International Botanical Congress in Stockholm. Werdermann worked as acting director of the botanical garden in 1951 and became the director of in 1955. On 1 April 1958 he retired. Werdermann died in 1959 in Hamburg and was buried in the botanical garden next to Adolf Engler and Ludwig Diels. Otto Eugen Schulz named in his honor in 1928 the genus Werdermannia of the cabbage family. Alberto Vojtech Fric honored him in 1930, with the naming of the genus Neowerdermannia of cacti. Eleven species bear Werdermann's name.

The area gained its name from the Center Grove Community School Corporation.http://www.centergrove.k12.in.us/ History During the 2000 United States Census, unincorporated White River Township accounted for 35,539 citizens (93% urban, 7% rural). * Estimated median household income in 2008: $79,660 ($69,033 in 1999) * Estimated median house or condo value in 2008: $199,602 (it was $149,800 in 2000) * Population density: 754 people per square mile * Residents with income below 50% of the poverty level in 2008: 1.5% In 2008, a panel was formed by the neighboring city of Greenwood, Indiana and selected residents from White River Township to evaluate the possibility of merging the area into the established corporate limits of Greenwood. Discussions of the proposed merger raised concerns with the southern town of Bargersville, Indiana who disputed elements of the Greenwood proposed merger plan for contested areas targeted for future annexation (generally select property north of the Bargersville town limits.) The measure has yet to reach public ballot. Additionally, there are public accounts of current Greenwood City Mayor, Charles Henderson, losing interest in making the White River Township merger a continued city campaign. Despite repeated attempts by the town of Bargersville to continue its northward annexation, the current White River Township Board Members / Trustee have yet to declare their views of what the future of the area may be. On January 4, 2011, the elected members of the White River Township (WRT) board took the first official action of public office to vote and reject the merger plan previously approved by the former WRT board members. The White River Township board members include Greg Rainbolt, Peggy Young, and Dave Pollard. During a board meeting held on January 4, 2011, Board Chairman Greg Rainbolt stated his desire to have serious discussions involving the future of the unincorporated Center Grove community, to include the feasibility of the Center Grove area studying the viability of becoming a town in the state of Indiana. = City of Greenwood, Indiana - The Proposed Merger = Many publications from the Greenwood Committee and White River Township board have been produced, voted on, challenged, re-produced, re-voted, and re-challenged by residents of Greenwood, unincorporated White River Township, and Bargersville. One reason for the City of Greenwood interests in unincorporated White River Township is based in part on the city's campaign to become a 'second class' city within the State of Indiana, as well as expanding its residential tax base to aid with the City's growing public debt. Despite opposition from local residents of Greenwood, the city council's campaign for the City of Greenwood to become a second class city http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.com/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID;=62&ArticleID;=44218 in the State of Indiana occurred without the proposed merger with White River Township ever being brought to public ballot.http://www.indy.com/posts/city-s- class-status-up-for-final-vote-in-greenwood The proposed merger technically may be considered as part of the public ballot slated for November 2012, but must obtain approval from the Johnson County Election Board before it can be placed before the public. = Town of Bargersville, Indiana - The Annexation Approach = The town of Bargersville, Indiana has been one of the chief opponents to the city of Greenwood, Indiana's campaign to reach a 'second class' city status through the proposed merger with unincorporated White River Township, as specified by the Indiana State Code. While both governmental entities have pushed their boundaries through extended utility services into unincorporated White River Township, the town of Bargersville has also made significant plays for landowners that share its northern town border through the annexation process. There have been some questions raised regarding Bargersville's legal authority to initiate annexations as their legal status as a town differs from that of a city. Greenwood's Mayor, Charles Henderson, has publicly expressed this concern, but after several rounds through state appellate courts, the issue will be resolved through the Indiana Supreme Court for the final decision regarding Bargersville's annexation filings. Incorporation of Center Grove Within the land battle of unincorporated White River Township between the City of Greenwood and the Town of Bargersville, a number of WRT citizens have asked if the public incorporation of 'Center Grove' has been considered to be fiscally beneficial to taxpayers and to the providers of public services. A non-profit group known as 'Citizens for Center Grove' publicly filed its formation with the State of Indiana and was approved by the Secretary of State, Todd Rokita, on September 30, 2010, and received a formal signature of approval on October 1, 2010.

The four museums were notable examples of the National Park Service Rustic style, and all were designed by Park Service architect Herbert Maier. The surviving Norris Museum, Fishing Bridge Museum and the Madison Museum are collectively listed as National Historic Landmarks. The Old Faithful museum, the first of the series, was built at a cost of $8,500 and was completed in 1929. The museum was a low T-shaped single-story structure of rustic log and stone construction. Two stepped sections of roof dominated the main portion of the building with deep overhangs supported by angled log brackets resting on a raised stone foundation sill. A perpendicular wing extended in the direction of the parking lot. The building resembled the Madison and Fishing Bridge museums. The museum's surroundings featured an amphitheater for ranger talks and a small garden of native botanical specimens. The Old Faithful museum was demolished in 1971 to make way for a full-scale Mission 66 visitor center on the site, midway between the Old Faithful Inn and the Old Faithful Lodge, facing Old Faithful geyser.

Historically the area was identified as Mataram. The region was the center of both the Medang i Bhumi Mataram kingdom in the 8th to 10th centuries, and later the Mataram Sultanate in the 16th century. It has been an important location in Central Javanese history and culture for over a millennium since it contains many ancient archaeological remnants of historic significance. If each temple structure was counted separately, the 9th century Central Java period could be said to have produced thousands of temples, scattered from Dieng Plateau, Kedu Plain to Kewu Plain.Prambanan and Sewu Exhibition: Safeguarding a Common Heritage of Humanity, 15–24 January 2010, Bentara Budaya Jakarta 2010 Apart from the Prambanan Roro Jonggrang complex, Kewu Plain along with the valley and hills around it is the location of some of the earliest Hindu-Buddhist temples in Indonesia. Adjacent to the complex to the north are Bubrah temple, Lumbung temple, and Sewu temple; to the east are found Plaosan temple. Kalasan temple and Sari temple are to the west, and further is the Sambisari temple. The Ratu Boko compounds are on higher ground just to the south. The discoveries of archaeological sites scattered only a few miles away suggested that this area was once an important religious, political, and urban center of central Java. Despite the smaller scale of its temples, the diversity and sophistication of the archaeological sites in this plain are comparable to Angkor archaeological site in Cambodia. Borobudur and Prambanan in particular, are popularly regarded as the two Indonesian temples to rival Angkor Wat in Cambodia. In 2012, the Balai Pelestarian Peninggalan Purbakala Jawa Tengah (BP3, or the Central Java Heritage Preservation Authority) suggested that the area in and around Prambanan should be treated as a sanctuary. The proposed area is in the Prambanan Plain measuring measured spread across the Sleman and Klaten regencies. The area includes major temples such as Prambanan, Ratu Boko, Kalasan, Sari and Plaosan temples. The sanctuary is planned to be treated in a similar fashion to the Angkor archaeological area in Cambodia, which suggests that the government should prevent or regulate permits to construct any new buildings, especially the multi-storied buildings, as well as BTS towers. This was meant to protect this archaeologically-rich area from modern day visual obstructions and the encroachments of hotels, restaurants and any tourism-related buildings and businesses. Agriculture Javanese women planting rice in a ricefield near Prambanan, Yogyakarta For centuries Prambanan Plain, overshadowed by Merapi volcano, was known for its rich and fertile volcanic soil perfect for intensive rice cultivation. The economy of Java relied heavily on rice agriculture, and the ancient polity of Central Java, with their complex political, economy and social systems, flourished on this plain. The images of rice agriculture scenes and activities can be found in bas-reliefs in Borobudur and Prambanan. The early Mataram Kingdom was dependent on rice yields and tax collected from their subjects. Java was famous for rice surpluses and rice export, and rice agriculture contributed to the population growth of the island. Many of the rice paddies in the landscape remains unchanged from the earlier eras. Archaeological sites 600px * Kalasan. According to Kalasan inscription it is the oldest temple built in the plain.

The bestselling author of more than 30 books, Yu was described by the New York Review of Books in 2012 as \\"one of China's most prominent essayists and critics\\". Yu Jie is also active in the Chinese dissident movement, and was arrested and allegedly tortured in 2010 for his friendship with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo and a critical biography of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao titled China's Best Actor. Following more than a year of house arrest, Yu emigrated to the US with his family in January 2012. Later that year, he was awarded the Civil Courage Prize of the Train Foundation. More recently, he has become among the most outspoken Chinese-dissident supporters of Donald Trump's policies towards China. Upon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death in 2020, Yu says he \\"laughed to the heavens\\" to celebrate the death of \\"America's most evil enemey.\\" Early writing career Originally from Chengdu, Yu attended Peking University and majored in modern Chinese literature. His first book, Fire and Ice, included extensive political and social criticism. Upon its 1999 publication, Yu became a \\"literary sensation\\". In the same year, he met and befriended democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, and became active in the Chinese dissident movement. As part of his work with Liu, he read and commented on drafts of the democracy manifesto Charter 08 and helped found the Independent PEN Center. Yu became a bestselling author in China and as of 2012, had written more than 30 books. However, his criticisms of the government eventually caused his works to be banned in mainland China. In 2004, Yu published the piece \\"Apologies to Tibet\\" () on boxun.com, which expressed regret for China's rule of Tibet and praised the efforts of Palden Gyatso, a pro-independence monk. His piece was criticized by Chinese netizens and he was heckled by overseas students in Los Angeles for attacking \\"national unity\\", but he dismissed these critics as angry brainwashed youth. Yu Jie also promotes reconciliation with Japan, the US invasion of Iraq, and religious freedom in China for Christians, after converting to Christianity himself. 2010 arrest Yu was detained by security officials in July 2010 to discuss his upcoming book China's Best Actor: Wen Jiabao, \\"a scathing critique\\" of China's prime minister that Yu intended to publish in Hong Kong. The book argued that Wen's warm, empathic public persona was simply a facade, and that he shared the same goals of other Chinese leaders. According to Yu, one official stated that his book was \\"harming state security and the national interest\\", and if it were published, Yu would probably be imprisoned \\"for many years\\". Yu nonetheless proceeded with publication of the book in August. On October 8, 2010, Yu's good friend Liu Xiaobo was named the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. On October 13, Yu was placed under house arrest, allegedly for his plans to write a biography of Liu as well as for having proceeded with the publication of China's Best Actor. He later wrote that during this period, \\"I was tortured by the country’s secret police and nearly lost my life\\". According to Yu, he was stripped naked, burned with cigarettes, and beaten until he was hospitalized. His house arrest, and a concomitant travel ban, lasted until January 2012, at which point he and his family emigrated to the US. Following his emigration, he submitted a nine-page report detailing his alleged torture to the US State Department and the United Nations Human Rights Council. He stated that he was continuing to write Liu's biography, and was also at work on a new biography of Chinese president Hu Jintao titled \\"Hu Jintao: Cold-Blooded Tyrant\\". Personal life Yu has a wife, Liu Min, and one son, Yu Guangyi. He converted to Christianity in 2003, and in China was a member of a house church. Awards and honors In 2012, Yu was named the winner of the 2012 Civil Courage Prize of the US-based Train Foundation. The prize recognizes \\"steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk — rather than military valor.\\" The prize comes with a $50,000 honorarium. He was the first Chinese person to win the award, and he stated that he hoped the prize would encourage China's dissidents. Main works *Yu, Jie.

Remains of a child buried together with possibly the mother. Los Placeres is an archeological site located between the “Waspán” and “Tabacalera Nicaragüense” neighborhoods at kilometer 4½ of the “Carretera Norte”, in Managua, en Nicaragua. The site extends to the coast of Lake Managua. A large part of the area that delimits the site is being impacted by a new urban settlement known as Barrio Hugo Chávez, which divides the site, where its new settlers have disturbed the ground for installation of pipes for drinking water, toilet and housing, this activity has caused a serious incidental findings and impacts to the prehispanic archaeological site. The Sector where the largest concentration of material evidence is on the surface is where excavations and archaeological research was made, mainly in the place that still preserves prehispanic mounds or architectural structures which probably corresponded to domestic or ceremonial areas. This material is part of the document \\"Los Placeres, a scientific interest archaeological site.* Archaeological investigation background Due to the internal complexity this site has drawn interest and attention and is catalogued as object of scientific importance and research by the characteristics of its environment, and archaeological evidence observed; a group of archaeologists led by Dr. Frederick Lange in the 1980s (Lange, 1983, Sheets 1983) carried out an inventory and recognition of interest sites in the Pacific area of Nicaragua with the purpose of determining different settlement patterns within the Great Nicoya Sub-Cultural area, this prospection included Los Placeres, finding the presence of multiple chronological periods of occupation 500-800 CE, 800-1350 CE and 1350-1530 CE., and main structures and spatial distribution of potential settlements that inhabited the banks of the Lake and its regional connection by means of the lake. Dominican Victor Holguín conducted two surveys, the results do not offer much interpretation of cultural material due to lack of knowledge and its classification system (Holguín: 1983). Ten years later, archaeologist Ronaldo Salgado conducted a survey and surface recollection determining that site was probably occupied from 500 to 1500 CE, which coincides with the material analysis of the controlled excavations performed by Stauber in 1996. (Stauber: 1996) Therefore, it is suggested that apart from this site together with other registered by population impact by the Archaeology Department of the National Museum (Pichardo: 1996), (García: 1996) (Espinoza: 1996) (Zambrana: 1996) located on the shores of Lake Managua that used aquatic and land resources and fertile land for deployment in this area. It is possible that biological characteristics determined and influenced the way of life, work and ceremonial and funerary practices in prehispanic Managua, and late period at the time of contact (Oviedo: 1976), in his descriptions he mentions a town very prosperous and a beautiful and populous square. (Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, 1976: 3 376-377). For several years after the eighties, natural disasters, water floods, agriculture, erosion, grazing livestock, robberies, lack of budgets and human resources of the cultural institution, destined for archaeological research has minimized research in the area, even with the existence of potential areas considered part of the archaeological reserve of one of the sites with a great information potential, of native people who lived on the shores of Lake Managua. (Stauber: 1996). By 1996 within the Managua Metropolitan Zone archaeological research project (Lange: et al. 1996) (Stauber: 1996) (Pichardo: 1996) during his second season performed investigation, prospecting and excavation as it was considered a site of great scientific and ethno historical interest, where results determined it to be a multiple components site, represented by different occupation periods, Bagaces (300-800 CE), Sapoa (800-1350 CE), Ometepe (1350-1550 CE) and foreign contacts according to diagnosed pottery, also found a variety of domestic residues represented by the different ceramic types (Stauber: 1996) and lithic stone artifacts for hunting, fishing, grinding, also the location and distribution of several mounds where quantity and density of surface archaeological material is evident; where it is possible to affirm that there was a large population concentration. During these excavations (Stauber: 1996) as result of the analysis of the material, concluded with emphasis on regional trade with groups of the central part and the Pacific through the lake, a possible social stratified organization, with emphasis on local organization. What has not yet been reported on any field report and material analysis, of the aforementioned in the Los Placeres archaeological history (Stauber: 1996) is the evidence of burial areas. It is necessary to systematically extend research and with scientific rigor with the purpose of defining burial spaces and obtain data related to prehispanic burial patterns on the site. The population has impacted many secondary burials in Sacasa striated type urns (Bonilla et al. 1990), with small offerings pots, in different Managua settlements; mainly located on banks of Lake Managua, and other burial findings found in neighboring sites, as in Barrio Domitilla Lugo, El Rodeo (Pichardo: 1996), Las Torres (Garcia, Vázquez: 1996), and the San Cristobal site (Weiss: 1983). It is likely that each hamlet or native settlement demarcated its burial area, because it is a decisive element to define social stratification by its funerary trousseau and the spatial distribution of the site and the village. At the site Las Torres (Garcia: 1996) close to the lake shore, an important funeral pattern was found, scientifically recorded during archaeological investigations to develop in the area of the Metropolitan area of Managua and could determine a social stratification and form of collective burials or family based on spatial distribution and funerary trousseau. The materials studied by Stauber within the second archaeological research season in the Metropolitan Zone (1996) the percentage of classified and scanned material, reported a strong presence and percentage of Sacasa striated type (Bonilla et al. 1990: 227) and suggests that perhaps had utilitarian and household use. Within the main Sacasa ceramics burials, frequently over 50% of excavated materials depicted specific uses and utilitarian purposes represented in dishes called tecomates, ollas with enlarged outward edge, and outside of the utilitarian function, Sacasa seems to have had significance as burial pottery. (Bonilla: 228) represented in the funerary urns, boot or shoe shaped. Prehispanic Funerary Urns Placeres Double Burial. Detail of remains of child and mother. During urbanization work and activities near a House, 4 prehispanic funeral urns were found, one of them large was placed in the center with a circular lid possibly Sacasa Striated type (800 BC-1350 DC, Bonilla et al. 227). Lack of current population awareness and the interest by the belief that it contained treasures; artifacts were completely destroyed and altered the context and archaeological record. Lack of prevention and supervision causes that each day more sites are destroyed and therefore the archaeological information. All recovered parts were inventoried and taken to the restoration and laboratory of the Anthropology Department of the National Museum for their proper restoration, conservation and study by archaeologists. Most urns and the skeletal remains are completely fragmented making it almost impossible to determine its context and spatial distribution; it is not possible to determine sex or age of the individuals. In general and according to burials characteristics found in the Pacific area and the coast of Lake Managua (Garcia: 1996) it is a funerary component possibly of one or two individuals due to the amount of Sacasa Striated type urns shoe shaped, also possibly associated with Papagayo ceramic polychrome fragments (800-1350 DC). Other ceramic types associated with children burials is Las Brisas (not yet dated) where a funerary burial was found and the Sitio del Ferrocarril site in the city of Managua (Zambrana: 1996). Also at the laboratory are two shoe shaped miniature Sacasa Striated vessels associated with the funeral component where it is supposed that these had remnants of food or fish bone (García: 1999). An archaeological recovery was made by a trench 6 x 4 meters long and width respectively, the excavation was abandoned for more than 15 days, were objects and human remains were displayed of the prehispanic inhabitants of the site. Excavation had reached a depth of approximately 35 to 40 centimeters depth at the time it was abandoned. Each of the funerary urns was coded using numbers 1 to 8, then surface cleaning was made and proceeded to excavate around before lifting, it must be clarified that most of these burials were already completely excavated and suffered vandalism. The maximum burial depth approximately ranges from 75 to 80 centimeters, only the oblong funeral urns were seated on the geological stratum known as Talpetate. The Site Current residents have built latrines and in most archeological remains have been found; vegetation consists of fruit trees, bananas, and ornamental plants in the houses. Soils are sedimentary; clay with very fine light brown sand residues, the fertile stratum ranges between 30 and 40 centimeters in thickness in succession appears the Talpetate stratum. Spatial Burial Distribution Placeres Double Burial. Offerings detail at the foot of the human remains, turtle shell (?), pottery round jar and ceramics. Interpretation made about this burials area is that they seem to be distributed in the following manner and its description is made according to their north-south location: there are four red slip oblong-shaped funerary pottery urns of type known as Sacasa Striated located in north, south, east and west positions as if representing the four cardinal points. Burial 1: It is a secondary funeral urn burial, 60 centimeters in diameter which was discovered by the west side of the trench, was superficially fragmented and contents at the top disturbed, was aligned with burials 2, 8, and 3, which correspond to urns shoes shaped burials. Burials 2, 8 & 3: Were located in the center of the excavation between the urn 1 located on the west side, these are medium urns shoe shaped of the Sacasa Striated ceramic type, they were aligned with the tip east to west, the urn on the east side of the excavation was destroyed, as well as primary burial which corresponded to the human bones of an individual with the skull oriented to the west, the specimen was buried with extended hands facing where the sun rises. Anthropological biometric and cultural context data that could have been retrieved from these human bones was lost due to its total destruction. Burial 4: By the southwest side of the excavation associated with funerary urn 7, oblong shape urn 4 ) shoe-shaped was found, the tip in position west, aligned with urns 1 and 6; while cleaning it human remains were found that correspond to lower limbs of an adult specimen, the bone remnants were found at the west of the urn. Burial 5: It was located exactly at the center of Northern excavation profile and refers to a funeral urn, it is the only one that did not suffer disturbance except for the vessel which served as cover of the same; it was on a straight line from urns 7 & 8 and oriented north to south. Burial 6: Between funeral urns burial 1 and 7, next to the southwest corner of the excavation found burial 6, which consists of an oblong ceramic Sacas Striated type and with a Murillo neck vessel applied which functioned as the urn lid, this urn type was the only one that had a different pottery type, is possible that the use of this type of ceramic mark a cultural burials differentiation, the medium shoe-shaped urns belong to infant burials and there is only one child buried in a medium oblong urn Sacasa Striated type, that was also disturbed. Burial 7: It is an oblong ceramic Sacasa Striated vessel, located at the south and associated with burials 4 and 8 and in a straight line with funerary urn number 5. Only the burial mold was found where it was deposited on the Talpetate stratum, disappeared from the excavation and the whereabouts of prehispanic object is unknown, also lost is the cultural information. Burial 8: It is a medium prehispanic piece shoe shaped, only the mold impression was found, left on a clay layer, disappeared from the excavation and cultural information was lost. About these cultural vestiges two possibilities are inferred; the first is that it is related to a primary burial, disturbed or altered at the excavation time and second that the human remains were placed alongside the urn as funerary offerings. At the top of the ground of the dirt that contained this urn the mold or footprint where the small vessel was located that probably was the funeral offering of an infant. This burial was also disturbed and stolen. All objects used in the burial ceremony were oblong and shape shoe ceramic Sacasa Striated Urn type and only one distinguished by having a lid made from ceramic Murillo neck applied type. It must be established that all burials were disturbed and stolen and that the prehispanic objects corresponding to burials 7-8 and the urn 6) lid disappeared and their whereabouts is unknown. Funeral burial or urn number 9 which was associated with the bones of a direct burial by this sector of the trench was completely destroyed by the person that performed the excavation. Laboratory Work In relation to the ceramic it can be asserted that only three types of ceramics are reported: Sacasa Striated, Murillo neck applied, some Papagayo polychrome ceramic pots, there were basalt and chalcedony lithic chips. Funerary urns were transferred to the laboratory with part of their archaeological contents were burials urns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Osteology Analysis Analysis conducted on the archaeological evidence found in each of the urns provided the following data: Urn 1: diameter of 60 x 55 cm width and height respectively, found at between 30 and 40 cm depth relative to the edge of the urn begun appearing the first bone fragments. The first anatomical part discovered was part of the skull which was placed face-down, the ribs, shoulder, scapulae and phalanxes were associated with the humerus and ulna – left side radius on the left side of the head. Lower limb of the skeletal remains were on the right side of the skull, the femurs below and the tibia - fibulae above, the pelvis and vertebrae residues were below the skull. According to the biological characteristics of the bone and based on teeth wear, the human remains seem to correspond to an adult female specimen, aged 30 to 35 years approximately. Furthermore, there were deciduous teeth remains or milk molar, premolar, canine and incisive, which appear to approximately correspond to a 1 to 2 years old child. Unfortunately the conservation state of the long bones did not permit obtaining biometric data to infer about the height of the adult individual. Inside two small vases were found, one oblong shaped, flat base and wide mouth (8 cm) short-necked measuring 8 x 11 cm in height and width, Sacasa Striated ceramic type. The second corresponds to a small vessel with socket base, short neck; red slip probably associated with the red Rivas ceramic, measured 9 x 10 cm, height and width, and the mouth diameter is 5.2 cm. These vessels are considered funerary offerings that relatives or family deposited with their dead at the time of the burial ceremony. Surely human remains deposited in this urn belonged to the mother and her baby, a collective family burial in a zone of burials. URN 2: Corresponds to a prehispanic piece shoe shaped with the following dimensions: Length 40, width 28, height 31 and mouth diameter 21.5 cm, was recovered completely fragmented and altered, at the bottom of the urn were found remains of temporary dental or deciduous molars, premolars, canine and incisors that seem to correspond to an infant aged 6 to 8 years approximately. URN 3: This artifact is similar to the previous one and has the same dimensions, inside a chalcedony chip was found, 2 of flint stone, and one of basalt. In the cleaning process animal remains were collected corresponding to fish vertebrae, amphibians, and evidence of vegetal remains and wildlife with combustion evidence (coal). Human remains consist of very small residues including temporary dental parts or milk teeth: Molars 3, premolars 2, the four canines and 4 incisors. According to the biological characteristics of teeth roughly appear to belong to a child aged 12 to 18 months. Mixed with the children remains 92 elaborate necklace beads made from clay cylindrical shape were found, round shape decorated in brown and black, they probably formed a small baby necklace that was possibly worn around his neck as a body adornment. From these burials is the only reported with this type of offering, in addition to lithic residues and fauna remains; this evidence probably constitute the child funerary dress that could be considered as a cultural differentiation element with regard to the \\"social status\\" of the individual. Associated with this urn skeletal remains were discovered that seem to correspond to an adult specimen and was directly deposited on soil or direct burial. The human bones of this burial were destroyed by some local children who threw stones and subsequently the skeleton was destroyed completely by the person that commenced the excavation, this action against cultural property was completely vandalism. URN 4: This was located by the south end near the southwest corner of the excavation; it is a medium-sized urn equal to the previous and the same ceramic type. While being rescued it was found in the same fragmented state and stolen. At the laboratory remains of human bones were found inside, which corresponds to a child. Probably the infant relatives deposited a small vase as offering, the dirt containing the urn still had the mold of the small vessel that was extracted and stolen by vandals. While retrieving the remains human remains were found at the west side of the urn, it is inferred this was a primary burial, probably disrupted, and probably buried with the body pointing south to north; the human remains seem to correspond to fragments of an adult lower limb, gender and age undetermined. URN 5: It is an oblong Sacasa Striated ceramic type with dimensions of 60 X 60 cm in height and diameter respectively, its mouth measures 30 cm long and was located in the center of the northern excavation. This funeral burial is possibly the least damaged because it was only partially unearthed; only the urn upper part and the lid vessel were damaged by predators. To extract this urn its content was partially excavated \\"in situ\\", then packaged and carefully moved to the laboratory. Using the same methodology that was used in the cleaning of the previous urns allowed us to obtain the following information: Excavation was made in small layers and at about 20 – 25 cm depth relative to the edge of the urn began to appear the first human skeletal remains, then discovered a skull, which was carefully cleaned discovering it had been placed face down, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, and shoulder were on both sides the head, skull was oriented towards the east. Among the human remains, the following dental pieces were found: lateral superior incisive left, and right and the central, two central lower incisive, canine superior left and right and bottom right, M1, M2, lower rights M3, M1, M2, M3 left inferior, left upper M3, Pm1, higher rights Pm2, Pm1, upper left Pm2, Pm1, lower rights Pm2, Pm1, left Pm2 lower. Well-formed cusps are seen in all the molars, there is no enamel attrition, and teeth wear is in acceptable condition what indicate that these belong to a young person. On the basis of morphological burials as the mastoid process, the jaw, wears and biological characteristics of their teeth it is inferred that these belong to a young female specimen, aged 18 to 21 years approximately. Pathology: Only the M2 showed decay evidence (spots), and low concentration of tartar dental cement in most teeth. Below the woman skull, in sequence were found, cranial bones that according to their anatomical characteristics and biological seem to correspond to a male specimen, who was placed face-down oriented north; seems to be that the lower extremities of both individuals were package deposited in east-west direction and upper extremities north-south. Clavicles, vertebrae, ribs, etc. were found on both sides of the head, as well as the woman. Among the unearthed human remains are: A fragment of the left jaw branch that preserves dental pieces M1 and M2, a fragment of the jaw left side which preserves in its anatomical position dental pieces Pm1 Pm2, M1, M2 is observed that wear is homogeneous in all the molars. Among dental disarticulated pieces the following were found: right upper lateral incisor, a lower left canine, lower molars M2 left and right, the premolars Pm1, superior Pm2 left and right, 5 dental pieces, not possible to determine their anatomical position due to its conservation state. The exception is in M2, presents a much more marked wear, it is likely that this type of tooth abrasion was due to the individual using his teeth as a tool. According to the biological characteristics of the skull, jaws, long bones and tooth wear leads to conclude that these belong to a mature male adult of about 30 to 35 years of age. Associated with the previously described human remains is a right jaw branch piece which preserves its molar temporary M1 anatomical position (or milk) with much wear and the premolar Pm2 still in the alveolar orifice in the process of emergency. We is recorded a fragment of the left jaw that retains in anatomical position premolars Pm1 and Pm2 as deciduous teeth and is observed in the alveoli molar M1 permanent in emergency process. On the basis of these data it is inferred that the skeletal remains could correspond to an infant aged 10 to 12 years approximately. Pathology: Observed decay evidence in molars and tartar concentration in most teeth, did not observe any sort of disease in the long bones caused by pathological problems. URN 6: It is an oblong medium funerary urn with the following dimensions: diameter 43 cm, height 35, mouth measuring 25 cm. The urn was located south of urn number 1. On the West side of the urn, human remains were found possibly part of a femur oriented north-south, it is likely that this was a direct burial that was disturbed at the time of depositing the urn. Among the human remains are present remains of a skull, a temporary molar, and remains of the upper and lower limbs. The remains suggest that it is a child of about 7 to 9 years of age. Bone fragments have a poor conservation status. URNS 7 & 8: Correspond to a child and adult burials, were extracted and stolen, unknown destinations, information was supplied by the residents of the place. Funeral Burial 9 & 10: Corresponded to a large urn, similar to 5 and a primary funeral urn, the remains seemed to be an adult specimen; the skeletal remains were destroyed and trampled by Jorge Espinoza. This is considered as a vandalism act to the archaeological and cultural assets of the nation, these cases of destruction of predation should be disclosed to society. Funerary Practices in Prehispanic Managua Funeral patterns practiced by prehispanic native settlers of Managua, interesting information is available, as is the case of archaeological records of burials with funerary trousseau that set or marked social stratification. The presence of a main burial is a sign of social stratification. The use of artifacts and green stones, are burials establishing the difference. As a rule, offerings characteristics are better indicators of social rank when they can be associated with personal data of the deceased, such as age and gender. E.g., a case of range acquired by kinship, unlike that achieved by merit, would be represented in the tomb of a teenage individual buried with authority and opulence symbols. The status distinctions have proved to be more difficult to determine that the ranks, especially in archaeological context for which there is no ethno historic or ethnographic direct analogy. This is the case when horizontal affiliation markers are perishable and survive as archaeological evidence; decorations painted on bodies, clothing, or hairstyles. (Garcia in Lange: 1996: 115). These types of secondary burials in funerary Urns seem to be the most common forms of the ceremony of burials; but in recent years that applied analysis on human bones unearthed some urns from different sites in the metropolitan area of Managua and the country found skeletal remains belong to 2 or 3 dismembered individuals, deposited in a same Urn. Osteological analysis leads to infer that these were real families or that have a kinship as in the case of the urn number 5, a man, a woman and infant human remains were found had no clothes, probably related to common society members that were buried in a collective burial or a mound. Burials, often in a mound, were practiced in all parts of Nicaragua, and almost in the entire Nicoya peninsula. In Guacas and Las Casitas, Hartman (1907ª, p. 15), could not determine the profile of hole where the body was placed, due to the special nature of the soil. These sites, and certainly in many others, prevailed secondary funeral, and body bones were piled around the skull. (Lothrop. V-I page 93) down. Sacasa Striated Ceramic, Cultural Aspects All urns and vessels belonging to the type, with the exception of a small red slip bowl, belongs to funerary offerings. The main burials diagnostic is that areas not covered with grooves or brush are made after cooking. Decoration is based on live forms, especially animal shapes and strips are applied and grooved. Finally, a number of such urns are shoe shaped. On the surface finish, the pots are observed scrapped inside and inside show brush, and stripes on the outside, while the earthenware display brushing on the inside surface and have a polished red slip. The most frequently represented animals are rodents, bats, peccaries and growling jaguars. Strips frequently applied with grooves, are disposed in spiral or long circles. Other models were used to depict rough eyes, eyebrows and other facial features, as well, round knots, buttons etc. The grooves are dominant decoration, however, they seem to have been made with strong, bristle brush, to scrape smooth surface without slip before cooking. The grooves tend to run horizontally around the vessel. Often groove markings in different directions, suggesting that the brushing technique was to completely cover the urn, modeling quickly and with meticulous care. It seems that this ceramic had many uses, in addition to its domestic function. A good number of funerary urns of this kind were found by Bransford (1881), lacking edge, suggesting that these could be removed while placing the body of the deceased inside, showing that this vessels were not always designed to be used as urns. (Lothrop, 1926: 254). This ceramic type marks a break with early traditions. It became the most important and common household type from the Apompua phase until the Spanish conquest (Haberland, 1986; 1992). Bransford (1881) found Sacasa Striated accompanied by earthenware Luna Polychrome, indicating the contemporaneity of both types (Garcia in Lange, 1996: 117).

Function  FOXA1 is a member of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins. These hepatocyte nuclear factors are transcriptional activators for liver- specific transcripts such as albumin and transthyretin, and they also interact with chromatin as a pioneer factor. Similar family members in mice have roles in the regulation of metabolism and in the differentiation of the pancreas and liver.  Marker in breast cancer  FOXA1 in breast cancer is highly correlated with ERα+, GATA3+, and PR+ protein expression as well as endocrine signaling. FOXA1 acts as a pioneer factor for ERa in ERα+ breast cancer, and its expression might identify ERα+ cancers that undergo rapid reprogramming of ERa signaling that is associated with poor outcomes and treatment resistance. Conversely, in ERα− breast cancer FOXA1 is highly correlated with low-grade morphology and improved disease free survival. FOXA1 is a downstream target of GATA3 in the mammary gland. Expression in ERα− cancers may identify a subset of tumors that is responsive to other endocrine therapies such as androgen receptor antagonist treatment.  Role in cancer  Mutations in this gene have been recurrently seen in instances of prostate cancer. Expression of FOXA1 correlates with two EMT markers, namely Twist1 and E-cadherin in breast cancer.

The chapel and attached cemetery are used today for burials by the municipality of Schalkenmehren. In the entrance way of the chapel are numerous Dank-Tafeln, plaques with inscriptions such as \\"[Saint] Mary has helped\\".  Legends  There are several legends associated with the tranquil Totenmaar. According to one, a castle once stood on this spot in which a benevolent count lived with his servants, his hard-hearted wife and his only child. One day, the count returned home from the hunt and found only a lake in the place where his castle had stood. It was buried in the ground with all its inhabitants and had left behind a lake, the Totenmaar. Miraculously a cradle appeared on the surface, in which his child drifted safely to shore. The count's horse scraped a spring from the ground at the behest of his master. Later, out of gratitude for the salvation of his child, the count built a chapel, which is still preserved along with the spring.

The church is located in Westphalia, Iowa, United States, and the parish plant is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Saint Boniface Catholic Church District. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 16 resources, including six contributing buildings, one contributing structure, two contributing sites, one contributing object, six noncontributing buildings, and one noncontributing object. with History The area that is now Westphalia was settled by German Catholics in the 1870s. The community's founder, Herman Schwarte, envisioned a peaceful village where Germans could work the land, be self-sufficient and help one another. The community would be centered on their own church. The Emil Flusche home was the location of the first Catholic Mass. He was the land agent for the railroad who encouraged German Catholics to settle here and helped establish a Catholic church in this community. Bishop John Hennessy of the Diocese of Dubuque bought the property and established the parish in 1873. The cemetery was laid out the following year. In 1881 St Boniface became a parish in the Diocese of Davenport when it was established. Father Weber was the pastor when the church was built. Bishop John McMullen of Davenport dedicated it in 1882. The rectory (1888) and the carriage house/ barn were built during the pastorate of Msgr. Brommenschenkel. St. Boniface became a parish of the Diocese of Des Moines when it was established in 1911. It was incorporated the following year. The Rev. Hubert Duren became the pastor in 1926 after a period of decline for the town. He was born and grew up in Cazenovia, Wisconsin, the son of German immigrant parents. Duren's ordination in his native Diocese of La Crosse was blocked by the German clergy there, in part, because he led a group of students who opposed German language instruction at Saint Francis de Sales Seminary in Milwaukee. He was ordained for the Diocese of Des Moines instead. Duren is credited with the community's rebirth through his Complete Life Program and the Westphalia Consumers Cooperative Association. The intent of the Complete Life Program was to integrate religion, education, recreation, commerce, and credit in the communal life of the town. The cooperative was established after the Great Depression affected an already poor farm economy as a way to overcome individualism in rural life and to help the locals make a just living. It was inspired by the Papal encyclical Quadragesimo Anno (1931) of Pope Pius XI, and based on a similar cooperative in Rochdale, England. Duren also established the Villa Nova homes program which pooled the labor of local residents to build the houses and allowed the people to own their own homes. He also established a parish credit union, cooperative store, and a gas station. It was during his 36-year pastorate that the parochial school (1927), ball diamond (c. 1927), Shrine of Our Lady of Grace (1930), corn crib (First Fruits; 1933), and the clubhouse (1934) were built. Architecture St. Boniface Church was designed by Dubuque architect Fridolin Heer in the Romanesque Revival style. The workers baked their own bricks on site to build the church. It follows a rectangular plan and features a central bell tower capped with a spire, and three entry doors across the main facade. At one time the interior was richly decorated with a reredos behind the altar, statues, and stenciling. Except for a few statues, it was all removed in a renovation in 1971. The church and the rectory were covered with stucco in 1919. The rectory is a two-story brick residence capped with a truncated hipped roof. It was designed by the Omaha architectural firm of Creeglon and Berlinghof. The school building is a 2½-story brick structure designed by Lahr and Stangel of Omaha. It features a monumental stone veneered central entry. The cemetery is notable for a significant number of cast iron and hand-wrought iron crosses for grave markers. There is also a frame, Romanesque Revival, Chapel of St. Joseph located near the cemetery gate.

This provides a stiffer, lightweight wheel. Wobbly-web wheels are best known through their iconic use on Lotus racing cars of the late 1950s and 1960s.  Theory  The theory of a disc wheel depends on their behaviour as a stressed skin structure. Their materials are assumed to be inextensible, but flexible. Such a skin is stiff against tensile loads in the plane of the skin, but flexible for loads perpendicular to it. A flat disc is thus strong for radial loads in the plane of the disc and also for torques. It is flexible for axial loads, perpendicular to the disc plane and also for nutating, wobble of the axle at an angle to the main axis. A coned disc also becomes stiff against axial loads, as the web is no longer purely perpendicular to the axis of the wheel. Unlike a flat disc, there is no direction where the whole of a coned disc would be perpendicular (and thus flexible) to it. A drawback of a simple cone is that the wheel now becomes wider, along the axis. The wobbly web effectively \\"folds\\" a coned disc wheel into pleats, making it narrower again, but retaining the axial stiffness. This pleated disc is also stiffer against nutating forces. In architecture, similarly, a 'serpentine wall', is strengthened against sideways forces by corrugation, allowing a thinner, lighter, cheaper structure. A wobbly web wheel is a disc wheel with additional shaping, rather than a spoked wheel with merged spokes. To avoid stress concentrations, the webs form smooth curves rather than sharply defined spokes. Such wheels can be pressed from sheet steel, or cast in light alloy. Casting foundries prefer a disc that has a consistent wall thickness, as this makes shrinkage simpler to control. The Lotus wheel's peculiar shape was arrived at deliberately, by keeping this consistent wall thickness for ease of manufacture, and folding it to achieve the required variation of stiffness across the radius.  Fedden and the Cosmos  The first wobbly web wheel was a design for a pulley centre, circa 1884. A straight strip of steel, with width the radius of the wheel, was folded into sharp corrugations. This accordion pleat was then fanned into a circle, the inner folds being closer than the outer. This disc was then cast into an iron hub and folded tabs on the outside of the sheet riveted to the pulley rim. These pulleys were produced by J & E Hall of Dartford. Plans were also made to develop this into a railway wheel, with the corrugations pressed into the shape of a half-torus. The first use for a road wheel was by Roy Fedden for his Cosmos car of 1919. This pressed steel wheel used a disc with six spokes on alternating sides and three retaining bolts.  Railway locomotives  Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) railway locomotive wheel Steam locomotives use spoked driving wheels of cast steel. A few makers have favoured variants of this, seeking a more weight- efficient design by using various forms of hollow or girder spoke, rather than solid oval-section spokes. One of the most successful of these designs was the Bulleid Firth Brown (or BFB) wheel, often incorrectly confused with the Boxpok wheel. This had some features of the wobbly web, being developed from a flat disc wheel with short, wide \\"spokes\\" formed in it by displacing teardrop- shaped sections of the disc into another plane. Except for a few small lightening holes, this disc wheel is consistently one wall thickness thick, all around the disc. Like the Lotus wheel, the BFB wheel also displays wide shallow pleats at its outside diameter, with narrower steeper pleats towards the centre (see image). Although superficially visually similar to the BFB wheel, the true Boxpok design is, as indicated by its name, derived from \\"box spoke\\". This is a spoked wheel, with square box-section hollow spokes. The wheel disc in section is either two skin thicknesses at the spokes, or zero (i.e. open space) between them. Lightweight corrugated wheels, of a standard 860mm diameter, appeared in the 1980s for local commuter trains in Japan.  Aircraft  Undercarriage leg and wheel of a Supermarine Seafire Aircraft with cast light alloy wheels appeared in the 1930s. A common form in British military practice used a single-thickness disc, displaced sideways in sharp- edged segments and joined by radial webs. Such wheels were fitted to, amongst others, the Spitfire. This basic design served with little change into the 1960s and the jet age. The first distinctly wobbled web appeared on the Convair CV-240 of 1948. This used a wheel cast with nine narrow radial spokes formed from a curved disc. Lotus Climax 25  Lotus racing cars  Lotus Twelve The best-known example of the wobbly-web wheel was that used by Lotus for their racing cars of the late 1950s and early 1960s. These wheels first appeared on the Formula 2 Lotus Twelve of 1957. A similar wheel was used by Vanwall from 1958. The wheel's design was, in typical Lotus fashion, intended to achieve the lightest possible weight. This is particularly important for wheels, as they are unsprung weight and the cars intended to carry them were extremely lightweight. Their designer was Lotus's Gilbert 'Mac' McIntosh, although again, in a typically Lotus fashion, they were often credited to Colin Chapman. Unlike earlier 'waved' wheels, the Lotus design and its distinctive 'wobbles' was a deliberate feature, even down to the way that the wobbles are deeply indented near the hub and soften outwards to the rim. For ease of manufacture by casting, the wheels were designed with a constant wall thickness. Their stiffness (force/area) was required to be highest around the hub, so here the wheels were deeply and steeply folded. Towards the rim, distribution of this same force over a greater circumference and metal cross- section thus required less folding and their profile became a gentle wave. As for many other Lotus components, the wheels were cast from Elektron magnesium- aluminium alloy. They were cast by Stone Foundrieshttp://www.stone-foundries- limited.com of Charlton. Cooper were already using magnesium wheels and apart from their technical advantages, Charles Cooper had found it highly profitable to sell drivers the many spare wheels required for racing, rather than having an external supplier take the business, something that Chapman was keen to emulate. McIntosh and Chapman also obtained foundry scrap, failed wheels from Coopers, and studied these failures to understand the failure modes of a magnesium racing wheel. Lotus team's racing colours at this time were green and yellow, often small patches of each with the bodywork substantially of bare polished aluminium sheet. With the advent of the wobbly web wheel, rather than the previous wire wheels, the wheels were painted yellow and the car bodies green. This glossy bright yellow colour could be applied easily over the greenish-yellow zinc chromate primer used on the wheels to prevent corrosion. = 4 stud wheel controversy at Le Mans = Lotus 23, with 4- and 6-stud wheels just visible Lotus's main design principle at this time was Chapman's famous maxim, 'Simplicate and add more lightness'. The Formula Junior Lotus 20 and Lotus 22 extended this to their front wheels, which used a 4-stud fastening, compared to the previous 6-stud that was still used on their rear, driven, wheels. At the 1963 Le Mans, Lotus entered the new, and somewhat unfinished, Lotus 23, a widened version of the Lotus 22 two-seater. It was disqualified from competition before the race and did not take part. This was on the basis of its wheels, although not specifically due to the wobbly-web design. The car, as designed, used Lotus's typical 6-stud wheel at the rear but a 4-stud mounting at the front. The wheel rims were also wider at the rear, 6\\" vs. 5\\", with wider tyres of 5.50×13 rather than 4.50×13. As the rules for Le Man were still framed as a \\"sports car\\" endurance race, they required the carrying of a spare wheel. The 23 had such a spare, but obviously it could not be fitted to both ends of the car. The scrutineers rejected this and barred the car from competition. Matching 4-stud rear hubs were flown hurriedly from England, avoiding the incompatibility problem, but the scrutineers now objected that if 6 studs had been required before, 4 must be inadequately strong and still refused to allow the cars to compete. After this, Chapman replied \\"We shall never again race at Le Mans.\\", a promise that Lotus kept until 1997, long after Chapman's death in 1982. The following year's Can Am sports car, the Lotus 30, switched from wheel studs to centre- lock wheels. This was mostly due to the far greater torque of its large V8 engine, but it also avoided this situation re-occurring, as the 30 also carried a single spare wheel. = Spoked wheels = Lotus Climax 33, spoked front wheels and outboard brake discs, with wobbly web rear wheels and inboard discs. A drawback to the use of a disc wheel, particularly for front wheels, is the lack of airflow through the wheels, which is important for cooling the brake discs. The rear wheels of single-seat racing cars are driven by driveshafts from the transaxle and the brakes are usually mounted inboard in any case, away from the wheels. Later Lotus designs, from the 26 onwards, used spoked wheels, although this was more about the shrinking diameter of racing tyres, especially fronts, rather than brake cooling. With an open-wheel racing car, any shrouding from the wheels was never a serious limitation. = Alloy problems = As for many articles made from Elektron alloy, corrosion of the magnesium was a problem for long-term service. Even though Lotus only used these wheels on its racing cars, not its road cars, they had a limited service lifetime. Lotus cars of the 1960s are still popular for historic racing, but these wheels are now no longer acceptable for competition scrutineering, no matter what their apparent condition. As the wheels are such a distinctive part of the car's appearance though, there are modern reproductions available.

Highly regarded for his knowledge of Japanese prints and his passion for American folk art and crafts, he was also praised for his devotion to contemporary American art, for his defense of non-juried art exhibitions, and for the support he gave to talented artists. At his death, the painter Wood Gaylor said of him: \\"Mr. Field was one of those rare personalities that come to the front once in a century or so. A combination of painter, critic, teacher and editor, he gave all his time and genius to the furtherance of American art....\\" Early life and training Field was educated at Brooklyn Friends School whose advanced curriculum included classes in drawing. Initially aiming at a career in architecture he attended the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn from 1888 to 1892 and in 1893 enrolled in the Columbia School of Mines, Engineering and Chemistry. He left Columbia in 1894 to study at Harvard University but left after only a few months in order to travel to Paris where, influenced by wealthy and cultured members of his mother's family, he decided to devote his life to art. In Paris he studied under Gustave Courtois and Raphaël Collin at Académie Colarossi. He also received informal instruction from Jean-Léon Gérôme and subsequently studied privately under Lucien Simon and Henri Fantin-Latour. These artists were all traditional academicians and, under their guidance, he adopted a style that had little in common with the avant-guarde artists with whom he later associated. In 1898 Field went to Concarneau in Brittany where Théophile Deyrolle and Alfred Guillou had founded an art colony. There he met eight-year-old Robert Laurent and his parents. Field recognized and nurtured Laurent's talent as an artist, eventually bringing him (at age twelve) to live in his home in Brooklyn and thereafter remaining his close associate for the rest of his life. The family that eased Field's immersion in the art world of Europe attained its wealth and influence in Parisian art circles by the manufacture of porcelain in Limoges, France. Their factory, Haviland & Co., was run by a brother of Field's mother, David Haviland. His son, Field's cousin Charles, was married to the daughter of a prominent art critic, Philippe Burty, who was both a champion of impressionism and an early admirer of Asian, particularly Japanese, art. Possessing a winning personality and outgoing nature, Field was able to use the connections he made through his art teachers and his Haviland relatives together with his skill identifying and purchasing works of art and antiques to attain a reputation as successful Parisian artist and connoisseur. Career =Artist, connoisseur, collector= Field's success as an artist was limited by the number and intensity of his other interests. People he met in Paris, particularly his teacher Collin and the critic Burty, introduced him to Asian art and he soon became first a collector of and then an authority on Japanese prints. So great was his knowledge that at his death he was considered the \\"greatest authority in America on Japanese prints.\\" Hamilton Easter Field, Untitled [Washington Andirons], about 1912, oil on canvas, 42 in. x 35 1/16 in. Hamilton Easter Field, \\"River Front, New York, in Winter,\\" about 1912, oil on canvas, 12 13/16 in. x 17 16/16 in. Hamilton Easter Field, \\"First Footbridge, Perkins Cove,\\" about 1915, oil on canvas, 28 in. x 35 in. Field remained at his base in Paris for most of fifteen years, traveling from there to other locations in France, throughout Europe, and into Asia in order to study art and collect both art and antiques. In describing Field's \\"immense studio\\" in 1901, a reporter for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle exclaimed over the tapestries, paintings, and prints that covered the walls along with cases holding engravings, Japanese prints, and rare books crowding the floor called it an \\"artistic paradise in Paris.\\" When he returned to Brooklyn in 1902 for a three-year stay, Field brought with him young Robert Laurent and his parents. The four of them lived with Field's mother in the Columbia Heights house that she owned and in which Field had been raised. Over a period of three years, beginning in 1905, Field and his mother made frequent trips to Europe, visiting Paris, London, Rome, Dublin, Florence, Zürich, and Budapest. Laurent's parents returned to France at this time. Laurent returned home with them to complete his schooling then, in 1907, joined Field and his mother on their return to Brooklyn. In 1907 while at home between trips, Field sold some of his 1,000 Japanese prints. Returning to Europe in 1908, Field opened a studio apartment in Rome and made it his primary residence through May 1909. In 1909 Field's second cousin Frank Burty Haviland commissioned his friend Pablo Picasso to make a group of eleven paintings for Field. Each was to occupy a specific place on the walls of Field's library in Brooklyn. By 1915 Picasso had completed six of them but never made the remaining five and neither Haviland nor Field bought any of the six. Haviland was then serving as an ambulance driver and it is thought that the commission was abandoned because of the war. One of the six completed paintings, \\"Pipe Rack and Still Life on a Table,\\" was intended to be placed over a door to the room. It contains Field's initials, HEF, lower right as can be seen in the accompanying image. In 1910 Field returned from the last of the overseas trips that he took with his mother and thereafter the two of them spent most of the warm months in Maine and the rest of the year in Brooklyn. After her death in 1917 Field continued this pattern of dual residence. Field's favored locale in Maine was a coastal community called Ogunquit that had begun attracting artists at the end of the nineteenth century. Field had and his mother had begun summering there in 1904 and later bought a house they called Thurnscoe where Field made paintings that he showed in a commercial gallery in New York in 1905. Taking advantage of his solid reputation as an authority on Japanese prints and European art in general and capitalizing on the quality and extent of his personal collections Field was able to establish himself as a successful art dealer afterwards. =Art patron, educator, gallery owner, principal in artists' associations= In 1905 Field was given a solo exhibition at the William Glausen Gallery in Fifth Avenue in New York. All the paintings he showed were in a traditional style, revealing little or no influence of Cubism or other progressive movements. They varied widely in locales depicted, if not in the style in which they were made. An article in the New York Times describes the fifty works on show as \\"landscapes, townscapes, marines, figure pieces, and sketches from the coast of Maine and Long Island Sound, from Paris and New York, from France and Italy--even from Finland and Japan\\" In 1912 Field purchased the building next door to his mother's home and remodeled it from a boarding house into an art gallery on the first two floors with rooms rented out to boarders on the other floors. The gallery, called Ardsley House, held frequent, brief exhibitions that rarely gained mention in the New York press. Ardsley House exhibitions were frequent and short. Most consisted of paintings by Field himself and by Robert Laurent or of prints from the collections of Field and Laurent. Field sought to attract \\"persons of refinement and culture\\" as boarders, particularly artists and musicians. Field's first reported work as art teacher took place in 1905 before he and his mother departed on their extended European travels. At that time Field gave art instruction to boys at the Little Italy Neighborhood Settlement House. In 1911 Field began to build studios at Perkins Cove in Ogunquit designing them in the form of local fishermen's shacks and using parts from old barns in their construction and by 1914 had begun operating a summer school there. In 1916 Field bought a building at 110 Columbia Heights which, like Ardsley House, was both adjacent to his mother's home and in use as a boarding house. One of its former tenants was John Roebling who had chosen the location because it gave him views of the Brooklyn Bridge while it was being constructed. Field turned it into studios for use as an art school while keeping other rooms to be let out to boarders and made available to needy artists either for free or at low rent. He called the building the Ardsley Studios and the school the Ardsley School of Modern Art. The school attracted progressive young painters who had attended classes at the Art Students League in New York, including students of Kenneth Hayes Miller. They included Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Niles Spencer, Stefan Hirsch, Adelaide Lawson, and Lloyd Goodrich. Artists who occupied rooms in the boarding house part of the building included Hirsch, Kuniyoshi, Katherine Schmidt, and Elsa Rogo. Field did not attempt to impart a favored style on his students but rather emphasized individual development based on an instinctive approach to art. Overall, he hoped to engender a version of modernism that was uniquely American. He also indulged in a lively social life organizing get-togethers among artists that included drunken costume parties. As Field's aesthetic taste evolved he became more and more attracted to early Americana, including rustic furniture and rugs as well as pictorial art in a naïve style. In about 1917 he bought a farm near Ogunquit, in Neddick, Maine. He called it Sowerby Farm and began referring to himself as a farmer. From 1916 onward Field became increasing involved in the work of artists' associations. In that year he was elected president of the Brooklyn Artists Association. A year later he joined the Society of Independent Artists, became its corresponding secretary, and began to participate in the group's exhibitions. From 1918 to 1920 he served on the society's board of directors, leaving over a disagreement with Walter Pach concerning a policy of giving publicity to some artist-members and not others. In 1920 he formed a new organization, Salons of America, which would, like the society, exhibit the work of its member artists, but which would be free of the taint of favoritism. =Critic, editor, publisher= In 1913 Field wrote and self-published a book, The technique of oil paintings : and other essays. Subsequently, he established himself as a well-known and highly respected art critic. In 1919 he succeeded his friend Helen Appleton Read as art editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. In that year and the next he wrote reviews on exhibitions and artists for Arts and Decoration. In 1919 he also founded The Arts magazine and became its editor, publisher, and main contributor. The money he gained from subscriptions and advertising permitted him to expand it and increase the frequency from quarterly to monthly. It contained sixty-four pages at the time of his death in 1922. In addition to his skill as critic, editor, and publisher, Field showed a flair for self-publicity. Beginning in 1901 when a reporter described in great and enthusiastic detail his spacious studio overlooking the Seine to the day of his death twenty one years later he was frequently able to attract the attention of reporters from the Brooklyn press. There were short notices both on the art exhibitions he staged and on the musical and other social gatherings that he and his mother held in her Brooklyn home. Their travels together and their departures to and returns from their summer sojourns were also routinely reported. There were also lengthy reviews of Field's possessions and their display in his home. In 1902 the contents of his \\"beautiful\\" Brooklyn studio received notice, with its seventeenth century fireplace, Renaissance tapestries, Gothic chests, a painting by Fragonard and one attributed to Velázquez, and other antiquities. In 1904 a reporter described these possessions in detail saying Field's studio was \\"nothing short of a revelation\\" and that its contents were all \\"worth the study of the antiquary.\\" An article published in 1905 focused on the superb view from the third floor windows of Field's studio as well as the \\"wonderful old French furniture\\" and two carved oak columns overlaid in gold. A few years later a reporter contrasted the \\"almost medieval\\" studio interior with the \\"view by night of the New York skyscrapers and lights of Manhattan.\\" In 1913 a reporter listed some of the art Field displayed in his studio including works by Winslow Homer, Max Weber, John La Farge, Gaston La Touche, and Armand Guillaumin. He also described the elaborate decorations that Field and Laurent created for a room adjoining the studio. In 1917 a reporter described the lower basement of Field's home \\"with its rare prints and curios, and the weird and Oriental lighting effects [that] transport one out of matter of fact Brooklyn and into the lazy luxury and the peculiar mysticism of Turkish tradition.\\" Legacy The Arts magazine continued to be published from Field's death until the early 1930s with Forbes Watson as editor. The artists' exhibition association, Salons of America, continued under the leadership of Gaylor, Laurent, and Kuniyoshi until the middle 1930s. Field's will left his entire estate to Robert Laurent who used some of the funds he inherited to establish Hamilton Easter Field Art Foundation in 1929. The foundation was a collaborative effort involving men who had benefited from Field's support. In addition to Laurent the founders included Wood Gaylor, Stefan Hirsch, and David Morrison. The foundation aided progressive artists by using funds obtained in annual auctions of works by established artists to purchase the works of young and struggling ones. The buildings at 104, 106, and 110 Columbia Heights continued to attract members of the arts community as residents. Robert Laurent remained, as owner of the properties. Yasuo Kuniyoshi and his wife the artist Katherine Schmidt continued to live there and, during the 1920s and 1930s others, including the writers John Dos Passos and Hart Crane would as well. The summer school at Ogunquit continued under Laurent's leadership until 1960. At the time of Field's death the Brooklyn Daily Eagle invited seven prominent men of the New York art world to pay tribute to his memory. The artist, Stephan Bourgeois, wrote that Field was an exemplary teacher, bringing out the distinctive personal style that his students possessed; that he opened his house to struggling artists; and that he was a \\"farseeing and indulgent critic\\" whose strong personality helped The Eagle become one of the leading art papers of the country. The museum director, William Fox, praised Field's skill as collector and connoisseur, saying that his extensive collections of art from many lands and epochs showed his singular sensitivity \\"to beauty in all its art manifestations\\" and noting that he revered the art of the past while also being receptive to the new. The artist Gaston Lachaise mentioned Field's enthusiasm, charming optimism, and keen sense of fair play \\"which have made him stand head and shoulders over the opportunists frequently to be met with in the art world.\\" Wood Gaylor said, \\"Mr. Field was one of those rare personalities that come to the front once in a century or so. A combination of painter, critic, teacher and editor, he gave all his time and genius to the furtherance of American art, and it was to this drain on his vitality that we are deprived of many more years of active support.\\" Max Weber praised Field's sincerity, intelligence, sympathy, and sociability. Joseph Stella called Field a rare expert of \\"everything great in art, past and present.\\" Maurice Sterne called attention to Field's \\"rare nature: dreamer and man of action, lover of beauty irrespective of time and place. He could appreciate a Chinese masterpiece, a Greek original, or the work of an unknown contemporary: one who not only loved the latter but generously helped struggling earnest workers.\\" A reporter for the society weekly, Brooklyn Life, offered the following assessment of Field in a lengthy profile published in 1912 that showed how much stature he had already achieved a full ten years before the eulogies that accompanied his death: \\"Possessed of magnetic personality, a broad-minded culture and with intense enthusiasm, his ready sympathy and quick recognition of other men's powers and ability made him much sought after and extremely popular in Paris during the year years immediately preceding and following the exposition. ... Better known as a promoter, collector and connoisseur in art, Mr. Field exemplifies in his work the higher ideal individuality demanded in the past for the rank of an artist; a certain largeness of vision, a command and knowledge of the sister arts of music, drama and literature.\\" In the catalog for a 1934 exhibition of works purchased by the Hamilton Easter Field Foundation Elsa Rogo listed the artists who Field had encouraged or who had benefited from his financial support. Most of them had taken classes at the Art Students League and quite a few were members first of the Society of Independent Artists and then Salons of America. The list included George Biddle, Alexander Brook, Louis Bouché, Emile Branchard, John Cunning, Vincent Canadé, James Carroll Beckwith, Andrew Dasburg, Charles Demuth, Edwin Dickinson, Alfeo Faggi, Arnold Friedman, Wood Gaylor, Samuel Halpert, Pop Hart, Marsden Hartley, C. Bertram Hartman, Stefan Hirsch, Bernard Karfiol, Leon Kroll, Adelaide Lawson, Gaston Lachaise, Robert Laurent, John Marin, Henry Lee McFee, Kenneth Hayes Miller, David Herron Morrison, Georgia O'Keeffe, Jules Pascin, Charles Sheeler, Katherine Schmidt, Florine Stettheimer, Joseph Stella, Maurice Sterne, Eugene Speicher, Max Weber, Abraham Walkowitz, Russel Wright, Arnold Wiltz, and William H. K. Yarrow. Family and personal life Field was born in Brooklyn on April 21, 1873, to Aaron Field and his wife, Lydia Seaman Haviland Field. Aaron Field was a prosperous merchant who came from a family of prosperous merchants. He was born in New York in 1829 and died in Brooklyn in 1897. Lydia Field was a leading member of Brooklyn society, a founding member of Swarthmore College, and an ardent supporter of the woman's suffrage movement. She was born in 1838 in Jerhico, Long Island, and died in Brooklyn in 1917. Both parents belonged to prominent Quaker families whose ancestors had emigrated to America in the seventeenth century. Field had an older brother, Herbert Haviland Field, and a younger sister, Anna Haviland Field. He also had an older step-sister, Fannie Field, and two older step-brothers, Henry Cromwell Field and Edward Stabler Field. The step-brothers' mother, Charlotte (Cromwell) Field, was born in 1831 and died in 1863. Anna died in 1883 when Field was ten years old. Henry died in 1885 when Field was 12 years old and Herbert died in 1921, twelve months before Field. Field, his parents, and his siblings were well connected members of Brooklyn society. Their names appeared in editions of the Brooklyn Blue Book and Long Island Society Register and their accomplishments, travels, weddings, and other social occasions were regularly chronicled in Brooklyn Life, a glossy weekly similar to the better known Town & Country magazine. Herbert was a highly educated scientist who developed and marketed a system, called the Concilium Bibliographicum, for collecting, organizing, and disseminating information about research in the sciences. Edward was a merchant like his father, importing dry goods into New York from Europe. Field's financial resources were extensive. He earned money as an art dealer, profitably selling Japanese prints and other works that he had bought during his travels. While some of his students and boarders paid him little or nothing, others gave him fees and rent of some unknown amount. He earned money from his writings, again of unknown amount. During his mother's life he lived in her home in Brooklyn and she accompanied him on most of his travels, presumably paying all or most of his expenses. Although he and his brothers received small legacies in his father's will, she was her husband's main beneficiary. In 1905 she sold the family estate in Great Neck thereby increasing her revenues extensively. As a biographer of Field's brother Herbert points out, first his two parents then his widowed mother supported Field's education, his study in Paris, his travels through Europe, his acquisition of fine art, books, and antiquities, and his purchase of properties in Brooklyn and Maine. Although Field was a respected benefactor of struggling progressive artists, he was less generous in helping both his step- brother Edward and his brother Herbert when they were in need. When Edward's import business failed during World War I, he and his wife Lydia (called Lilla), came to live in Field's art school-cum-boarding house at 110 Columbia Heights. Lilla ended up with responsibility for managing the house, caring for the seventeen boarders, and stoking its coal furnace. During the same period Herbert's project to build an information service for scientists had lost momentum and was close to failing. His hopes of rescue by his family were disappointed when it became apparent that his mother had left her entire estate to Field and when Herbert's subsequent efforts to gain Field's support for the project came to nothing. Embittered by the experience, Herbert wrote his wife to complain that Field was irresponsible and self-centered. He said that Field was spending extravagantly to indulge his enthusiasms for art, for support of struggling artists, for development of his properties in Brooklyn and Maine, and for maintenance of his \\"companions,\\" the boys and young men with whom he shared his life. Only one source mentions Field's sexual orientation. In a telephone interview in 1986 Field's friend Lloyd Goodrich said, \\"What you fundamentally have to understand about Hamilton Easter Field was that he was a homosexual. The townsfolk of Ogunquit didn't understand him, and his behavior occasionally scandalized them.\\" Neither Goodrich nor any other source has linked Field's reported homosexuality with his apparent need to gather around him boys and young men with whom to share his life. In fact, apart from Robert Laurent only one of the young men whom Field brought to live with him is known by name. That is Raymond Webber, born and raised on a farm in York County, Maine, who, as a sixteen-year-old was recorded as living with Field as his \\"companion\\" in 1920. In addition, Herbert Field wrote that his brother brought a young African-American boy into his house in 1918 and complained that Field appeared to be putting a young man through college rather than helping his step-brother Edward whose business had collapsed. The African-American boy might have been Charles Keene, son of the woman who managed Field's boarding house at 110 Columbia Heights.

The Alumni Association of the school is known as VMS Alumni Association The school motto is \\"Knowledge, Courage, Service to Humanity\\". History VMS started with 300 students up to year 6. The children were trained to appear at their board examinations given by the local West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. In 1992 the school received the affiliation to Council for Indian School Certificate Examination which entitled the children to sit for Indian Certificate for Secondary Examination, for year 10, and Indian School Certificate Examination, for year 12). The 1st ICSE batch of 10 students appeared in 1995 followed by the 1st ISC batch in 1997. At this point, the school had its own building, opposite the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta at Joka. The school, from year 5 onwards, was shifted to its present address. Within a couple of years another building was annexed to the existing one to accommodate the increasing number of students. Growth began in the shape of science labs, computer labs, library, four halls—the second one is largely used as the audio-visual room, and a play house for the young ones and other facilities. The school also presently has extended its campus to Pailan Park with a 6 storied building, playground, swimming pool and a state of the art canteen.

In 1973, Brown left The Newcomers and recorded his first single \\"Did You Hear Yourself\\" on Stax Records. After several unsuccessful singles on a Stax subsidiary label, in 1975 he recorded \\"You Can Be Cured\\" and \\"Take a Few More Steps\\" on Mainstream Records, which he left one year later. Brown was persuaded to return to the studio by writer/producer Carl Hampton in 1978. After receiving a call from Hampton, with whom he had been at school, Brown recorded four tracks that were given to Russ Reagan at Parachute Records. One of the songs, \\"I'd Rather Hurt Myself,\\" left Reagan impressed and the song was then recorded. The song was well received by the public and then Brown recorded additional tracks, thus completing the album Welcome To My Room, which was released in 1978. \\"I'd Rather Hurt Myself\\" was well known in Brazil as \\"The Hang glider song\\", because of the scenes where it was played in the background, in the soap opera Pai Herói, in 1979. Brown had another success in 1980, \\"We Ought To Be Doin 'It,\\" which reached No. 16 on the R&B; chart in the United States. Hampton produced and wrote all of the material on Brown's debut album with Homer Banks, another long-time Memphis producer/musician. Brown recorded four albums for Casablanca Records' subsidiaries, Parachute and Chocolate City, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, often performing songs penned and produced by Homer Banks, now working with writer/guitarist, Chuck Brooks. At one point, Brown was also a short-term member of The Temprees. Brown's brother was William Brown, who was a member of The Mad Lads group and also a studio recording engineer, especially at Stax Records. He produced several tracks for his brother on Truth, which were later released in 1981 on an album on the re-activated Stax Records, following the takeover by Fantasy Records. Personal life Randy Brown lives in his hometown, Memphis. He came out of retirement to perform at London’s Jazz Cafe in December 2019.

First introduced in 2004 for owners and directors of major British football clubs, since November 2014 it also applies to the National Health Service in England for board members of NHS Trusts under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. Application to the National Health Service Directors of NHS Trusts can be deemed unfit if they have been involved in “serious misconduct or mismanagement”. The test is supervised by the Care Quality Commission but decisions are made by individual trusts. A Trust must be satisfied that its directors are: * of good character - consideration must be given to previous convictions and removal from a professional register when assessing this; * and have the qualifications, competence, skills and experience necessary for their office; * and are capable (once reasonable adjustments have been made) of performing tasks intrinsic to their job by reason of their health. A trust must not “appoint or have in place” a director who has been responsible for, privy to, contributed to or facilitated any serious misconduct or mismanagement (whether unlawful or not) in the course of carrying on a regulated activity. The CQC received referrals from campaigners and whistleblowers in January 2015 which alleged that more than 20 current and former NHS chief executives, medical directors and senior board level executives were unfit for their roles. In 2018 the Health Minister commissioned a review of the test which was conducted by Tom Kark QC who made 7 recommendations to strengthen it and make it applicable throughout the NHS. Amongst his recommendations were: to devise a set of competencies for directors to meet and be benchmarked against; to set up a central database to hold information about directors; to require full references for each director (a mandatory reference scheme) and to set up a Health Directors Standards Council to investigate and deal with serious misconduct by senior directors. The first two recommendations were accepted by Government, the rest are under review. Application in Football Stephen Vaughan fell foul of the test The test, introduced in 2004, is mandated by the Premier League, the Football League, the National League and the Scottish Premier League. Anybody who takes over a club, runs one, or owns over 30% of its shares must be assessed. The first director known to have failed the test was Dennis Coleman, director of Rotherham United when they went into administration in 2006 and 2008. He claimed: > \\"I came in and in effect saved the club. It is totally unfair for me to be > disqualified.\\" In November 2009, Stephen Vaughan, then owner of Chester City, became the first owner to fail the test, after he was legally disqualified from being a director of any company. This was a result of VAT fraud as owner of Widnes Vikings rugby club. He transferred control of Chester to his son, Stephen Vaughan, Jr. In March 2012, Rangers owner Craig Whyte was found not to be a fit and proper person as the result of an independent enquiry. In June 2014, Louis Tomlinson, former footballer and member of the boy band One Direction, and John Ryan, businessman and previous Chairman of Doncaster Rovers, launched a bid to buy the club but one month later Ryan was found not to be a fit and proper person due to a lack of funding. =Disqualifying events= The Premier League has tighter restrictions than the Football League or National League. In general, a businessman will fail the test if: *They have power or influence over another Football League club *They hold a significant interest in another Football League club *They become prohibited by law from being a director *They are filing for bankruptcy *They have been director of a club while it has suffered two or more unconnected events of insolvency *They have been a director of two or more clubs of which, while they have been director, has suffered an event of insolvency References Sources ;Websites  External links *CQC guidance Association football terminology National Health Service (England) ","title":"Fit-and-proper-person test"},{"id":"28995043","text":"The Traveller () is an Egyptian film directed by Ahmed Maher.

It is a former parish church of the Diocese of Sioux City. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. It has been reduced in status to an oratory. History The Cedar Creek area of Greene County, Iowa, was settled by Irish Catholics in the 1850s. Father Marsh from Fort Dodge said the first Mass in June 1863 in the home of Myles Fitzpatrick. Other missionary priests who served the area included Fathers Delaney, Concannon, Barry, McGrath, Mulvehill, O'Farrell, and Quirk. Fitzpatrick donated five acres of land for a church in 1872, and the lumber to build the building. It was the first Catholic church in Greene County. The white frame building with a bell tower was built by L. Isaac Ritchie. The first pastor assigned to the parish was the Rev. George Costello, who was the pastor at St. Patrick's Lohrville at the same time. Throughout its history, the parish was always a rural mission and never had a resident pastor. with The parish was founded in the Diocese of Dubuque and became a parish of the Diocese of Sioux City when it was established in 1902. The present church was built in 1915. It was designed by prominent Sioux City architect William LeBarthe Steele and built by C. F. Mayer of Humboldt at a cost of $24,000.00. The church was dedicated by Bishop Philip J. Garrigan of Sioux City, on November 7, 1915. Four years later on Sunday, June 15, 1919, the building caught fire and was reduced to a brick shell because there was nothing to battle the blaze. Because they had little money, the congregation was urged to merge with St. Columbkill's in Churdan. But they were determined to rebuild, and in the years following, the church was rebuilt using the old foundation and walls. The Great Depression was a difficult time for the parish. It owed the American Savings Bank in Carroll $2,383.99. The church property was put into receivership on September 6, 1934. Dennis Hayes bought the property in a public sale, the note was paid on July 6, 1936, and the property was returned to the parish. The church building started to deteriorate in the 1970s–80s and it was extensively renovated. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. St. Patrick's was part of the first parish cluster in the Sioux City diocese in 1988 when it was clustered with St. Columbkille's, St. John's Paton, and St. Bridget's Grand Junction. In 1995 the cluster was changed to include St. Patrick's and St. Columbkille's as before and St. Paul's Scranton. In August 1996 the parish was reduced in status to an oratory. Architecture The Romanesque Revival style church building measures and was constructed of matt-faced, vitrified brick and stone. The main facade is dominated by the tall, off-set corner tower. It originally had a bell in it, but the bell was destroyed in the 1919 fire and never replaced. The tower contains the main entry into the church. The building exhibits a couple of elements from the Gothic Revival style, a steeply pitched roof and the rose window on the main facade. The side elevations are six bays in length. All of the windows have round-arched openings that are filled with stained glass. The gallery in the back of the church has a small pump organ. The interior dates from the 1920s when the church was rebuilt after the fire. The church building never had running water, so two outhouses, one of brick and one of tile and stucco, were built on the property. They are contributing buildings in the church's historic designation. A wrought-iron gate located above concrete steps near the main entrance that is labeled ST. PATRICK'S is a contributing structure. The church building's significance is attributed to its association with William Steele, and it is considered one of the best examples of Romanesque Revival style in Greene County.

Development The Air Sedan was Stout's updated version of the Stout Batwing Limousine. William Bushnell Stout, having just completed his famous letter writing financing effort for the company, embarked on a new aircraft using the \\"thick airfoil\\" batwing design, combined with all-metal construction employed overseas in Junkers aircraft. Design The aircraft was a high wing single engine all-metal aircraft. The pilot and co-pilot sat side-by side, in an open cockpit mounted in the leading edge of the wing. The airfoil's chord stretched half the length of the fuselage, like the earlier batwing. The fuselage was fat and low slung compared to conventional aircraft of the time. Semicircular windows present in other Stout designs were installed. Operational history The Air Sedan was tested at Selfridge Field in Mt. Clemens, Michigan on February 9, 1923 by Walter Edwin Lees. The plane was considered underpowered. On one test flight, Lees and the lead engineer, George H. Prudden, took off with Stout as a passenger; they barely kept aloft, and landed in a neighboring field. Later the powerplant was replaced by a Hispano-Suiza engine.

It is managed by NHS Lothian. It provides ophthalmic care for Edinburgh and the Lothians, and tertiary care for South East Scotland. History The Eye Dispensary for Edinburgh was founded in 1822 on the Lawnmarket. One of the founders was John Argyll Robertson, whose son Douglas Argyll Robertson would later work on the eye ward at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 1834 a separate Eye Infirmary was founded. Departments for Ear, Nose and Throat were subsequently added in 1883 to form the Eye, Ear and Throat Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 1922 the Infirmary and Dispensary amalgamated to combined premises on Cambridge Street. In 1853 a new surgical hospital was built between the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh on Infirmary Street and Surgeon’s Hall, containing 19 beds for eye patients. The eye facilities were moved to the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh on Lauriston Place in 1870, and were expanded and moved to the purpose-built Moray Pavilion in 1903. This housed 44 beds and separate operating theatres, along with a substantial outpatient department on the ground floor. The current building, which was designed by Alison & Hutchison, formed part of the first phase of the intended re-development of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and was built between 1965 and 1969. The departments at the Moray Pavilion and the Eye, Ear and Throat Infirmary were amalgamated at the new site. The building was named the Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion in honour of Princess Alexandra, who officially opened the hospital on 1 October 1969. In 2005, then-Chancellor Gordon Brown became the patron of a centre of excellence within the Eye Pavilion. Brown had received treatment there himself in the 1970s after suffering a detached retina of his right eye in a game of rugby. NHS Lothian announced in July 2018 that a full business case would be developed with a view to moving the eye department to new premises at the BioQuarter campus adjacent to the current Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh site at Little France. Services The Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion specialises in treatment and care of conditions affecting the eye. The hospital contains one in-patient ward, two day wards, three intraocular operating theatres, extraocular surgery and procedure facilities, outpatient clinics and an acute referral clinic for emergency treatment.

Ballis was born on August 12, 1925, and was raised in Faribault, Minnesota. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during World War II and served in the South Pacific as a mechanic repairing torpedo bombers. After completing his military service, he earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota. One of his first jobs was at U.S. Rubber, where a manager told him that he \\"had to have a U.S. Rubber attitude... ready to go anywhere at anytime\\" but found that he \\"didn't have the U.S. Rubber attitude.\\" After his car broke down while he was on vacation in San Francisco, Ballis decided to live there and took a job writing headlines for article in The Wall Street Journal, where he was called in by his boss about his use of creative phrasing.Brown, Emma. \\"George 'Elfie' Ballis, 85, who photographed struggle of Cesar Chávez and migrant farmworkers, dies\\", The Washington Post, September 27, 2010. Accessed September 29, 2010. While working as an editor of a labor newspaper in the 1950s, Ballis took a photography course taught by Dorothea Lange, a photographer and photojournalist who had documented the Great Depression in her photos. He started taking pictures on his own, photographing migrant workers and showing the substandard housing and working conditions that they endured, saying \\"I wanted my photographs to reflect to them the power and dignity they had\\". Ballis made an effort to familiarize himself with his subjects before taking their pictures, a process by which he was able to take pictures having gained the respect of this he was photographing. Thousands of Ballis's photos captured the efforts of Cesar Chavez to organize Latino workers, leading to the formation of the United Farm Workers. Works by Ballis depicting protests and marches appeared in such publications as Life, Newsweek, Time, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Labor historian Richard Steven Street called Ballis's work \\"activist photography with a point of view\\" and credited him as being one of a small number of freelance photographers who brought Chávez the public attention he needed to succeed in his efforts. As director of National Land for People, Ballis opposed a June 1980 decision by the United States Supreme Court that ruled that a 1902 law limiting irrigated farms to did not apply in the Imperial Valley. Ballis called the decision \\"Morally, legally, socially, politically and economically, a bankrupt decision\\", saying that there were a disproportionate number of large corporate and foreign-owned farms that benefited from federal subsidies for irrigation, and Ballis expressed concern that the ruling could lead to the repeal of such limits in other agricultural areas of California.Lindsey, Robert. \\"13-Year Battle Is Ended In Rich California Valley; Victory for Big Farmers Claim Based on 1933 Decision\\", The New York Times, June 18, 1980.

The church is located in northwest Jackson County, Iowa, United States in an unincorporated community in Butler Township called Garryowen. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History The area known as Garryowen was settled by Irish immigrants from County Limerick and County Cork in 1838-1839. The parish was founded by the Rev. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP in 1840. At that time there were about 100 Catholics in the area. Three years later there were 600 Catholics, and the parish supported a school. with The first church building was a log structure, which was built by parishioners. Bishop Mathias Loras contributed $600 from the Society for the Propagation of the Faith towards its construction. Six other parishes were created from St. Patrick's. St. Mathias in Cascade, which at one time had been divided into the two parishes of St. Martin's and St. Mary's; St. Joseph's in Bellevue; St. Peter's in Temple Hill; Assumption in Sylvia Switch; St. Aloysius in South Garryowen, and Sacred Heart in Fillmore. St. Patrick's is the second oldest parish and it has the oldest church building in the Dubuque Archdiocese, and it is the oldest Catholic rural parish in Iowa. Architecture The present church was built in 1854, minus the tower. It was completed about 1875. Master builder J. Boland is credited with designing the church. The person who designed the tower is unknown, but it is similar in design to Dubuque architect Fridolin Heer's at St. Lawrence Church in Otter Creek. The stone for the church was quarried south of the church, and the lime for the mortar was kilned nearby. The rectangular structure measures with a projecting tower on the main facade. The tower is capped by an octagon-shaped belfry, also of stone, and a spire. The structure is six bays long, and there is a Gothic arched window in each bay. The main facade provides a symmetrical arraignment of three bays with an entrance portal in each bay.

Valdivia awarded the album 4 stars stating \\"With Rey Azucar, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs made their most high-profile album to date... Earlier Cadillacs albums were rooted almost exclusively in ska, reggae, and salsa, but on this record the band developed a harder sound, interspersing thrash and punk into the mix... Another significant change is that the album, apart from some light touches, seems to reflect a darker lyrical tone. Several tracks make references to depression and suicide. It's clearly an attempt to expand their musical and lyrical range, and on the whole, the album succeeds. The songwriting isn't as fully developed as it would be later on, but it's a superb place to start. \\".Valdivia, V.

The film depicts the shattered state of Germany, both physically and as a society, in the immediate aftermath of World War II. The narration explains what is being done – and what needs to be done – both by the occupying Allied forces and the German people themselves to build a better Germany from the ruins. Synopsis The film opens with a map of the German zones of occupation with the British zone highlighted. Voiceovers in a variety of English class accents offer a snapshot of what is being said about Germany in Britain (\\"They asked for it and they got it!\\", \\"You can't let them starve\\", \\"As far as I can see it'd be a good thing if some of them did die\\"). A series of images shows the country's shattered infrastructure, with destroyed roads, bridges, railway lines and factories. This is followed by shots of missing persons noticeboards and posters with the information that 30 million Germans – almost half the population – are still looking for lost relatives and friends. Destitute children are seen sitting aimlessly in the streets. A shot of a woman nursing a baby is accompanied with the statement \\"We can't wash our hands of the Germans, because we can't afford that new life to flow in any direction it wants\\". The military authorities are shown mobilising civilians to begin the task of cleaning up and rebuilding, and it is explained that the aim is to prevent not only starvation and epidemics, but also \\"diseases of the mind\\", i.e. \\"new brands of Fascism\\". People are shown living in the cellars of bombed buildings, without heat, light, water or sanitation. Coal is singled out as the single most vital resource, with the British \\"Coal Control\\" unit organising the output and distribution of the Ruhr coalfield production. A Catch-22 situation is detailed, whereby coal is needed for power and transport, but without the power and transport infrastructure already in place the coal cannot be moved to where it needs to be. There is no coal to spare for civilian use, so the populace have to forage for timber as a power source. Civilian railway travel on what survives of the network is only possible with a permit issued by the military authorities, but the volume of passengers still overwhelms the capacity. A train is seen leaving Hamburg for Kiel with dozens of people riding the buffers or hanging on the outside, ignoring loudhailer announcements that this is forbidden. The establishment of a new German police force is outlined, with the explanation that henceforth the policeman \\"must understand that he is the servant of the public, and not its master\\". Civilians receive food rations of between 1000 and 1200 calories per day. Survey teams from the Red Cross carry out tests on health to check whether the rations are adequate to keep people fit enough to work. Education is mentioned as a particular headache, as \\"you will never get Nazi ideas out of the heads of some of the adults\\". Children are seen playing among the ruins, but a new breed of teacher is being recruited to teach the next generation that \\"there are other things in life beyond Nazism and war\\". However schools and teachers are too few and children too many. The problem is that children are growing up \\"and getting more like their fathers\\". The Krupp family industrial dynasty is singled out for mention as \\"just as responsible for killing Allied soldiers as Hitler and Göring\\". Footage is shown of their destroyed ammunition and armaments factories. Surviving members of the Wehrmacht are seen being processed. These men must be reassimilated into society somehow, \\"not only their bodies, but also their minds\\". If so much as one man or woman is appointed to office while still believing in Nazi values and German supremacy, \\"you have the beginnings of another war\\". Therefore, they are all put through a rigorous demobilisation screening process. Anyone who is on the wanted list, or otherwise suspect in any way. is rejected for demobilisation and sent \\"back to the cage\\". When the nightly curfew falls, the civilian population must get off the streets and fix for themselves as best they can. Air-raid sirens sound \\"to remind them that it is up to them to regain their self-respect as a nation\\". The film ends with images of children dancing in a ring accompanied by the statement that the Allies will remain until they can be sure that the next generation will represent \\"a Germany of light and life and freedom...truth, tolerance and justice\\". Production Footage for A Defeated People was shot in the British Zone of Occupation, covering the north-west of Germany. Filming started in August 1945. The main location chosen for filming was the area in and around the devastated city of Hamburg, with scenes of Cologne, Essen and Aachen also used. The film was one of the first to show the consequences of World War II for ordinary German civilians, made at a time when the prevailing attitude towards them in the Allied nations was still of hostility and suspicion, alongside a desire for retribution and a sense that they were now justly reaping what they had sown and deserved every hardship that had come their way. Jennings acknowledged this in the film, while also trying maintain a neutral, non-punitive tone to highlight that attempts by the Allies to rebuild post-war Germany were vital to minimise the risk of future conflict. He admitted that it was extraordinarily difficult to find a narrative middle ground which was neither vengeful towards the German people, nor exculpatory of them. Writing to his wife from Germany, he said: \\"They certainly don't behave guilty or beaten. They have their old fatalism to fall back on: 'Kaput' says the housewife finding the street water pipe not working...'Kaput ... alles ist kaput.' Everything's smashed...how right – but absolutely no suggestion that it might be their fault – her fault. 'Why' asks another woman fetching water 'why do not you help us?' 'You' being us. At the same time nothing is clearer straight away than that we cannot – must not leave them to stew in their own juice ... well anyway it's a hell of a tangle.\\"Humphrey Jennings: Filmmaker, Painter, Poet Jennings, Mary-Lou. British Film Institute, 1982 Retrieved 28 September 2010 Modern analyses of the film tend to point up a dichotomy between the narration and the images it accompanies. There are some points in the narrative which overtly state that Germany as a nation must accept collective guilt for the outcome of a war they started; the images however show people as individuals and offer a measure of sympathy for their situation and hope for a better future. The British Moving Picture Archive suggests that here Jennings as a director shows an \\"interest in, and concern for, common humanity (which) cannot be repressed even in such a context\\".A Defeated People Moving History. Retrieved 28 September 2010 Critical reception A Defeated People received a very favourable reaction from contemporary critics, who viewed it as an important film on a vital subject of its day, which would answer many of the questions being asked by its audience about the reality of life in defeated Germany. Comments included: \\"Once again the Crown Film Unit do an inspired job of reporting.\\" (Sunday Dispatch); \\"This film will stay in your mind and that is high praise of any film. Though it reeks of desolation and defeat it is infused with purpose. You will never obtain from any written or spoken narrative such an effect of empty misery and crushed aggressiveness, of a country so lost it is ripe for anything.\\" (News Chronicle); \\"A grim panorama of destruction and ruin, of shattered industries, of tattered people living in cellars and searching for lost relatives.\\" (The Star) and \\"All the more impressive for its restraint. The tone is agreeably free from gloating.\\" (Daily Telegraph). The Daily Mail described it as \\"camera-journalism on a brilliant level\\", adding the interesting observation \\"it takes an observer with a touch of real inspiration to catch so memorably the spirit of cunning arrogance there even in defeat.\\" The main shortcoming of the film was cited as its brevity (18 minutes), meaning that it could only skim over the surface of the complex and intractable issues involved. The Daily Worker noted \\"It is a fine piece of screen-craft...but how the subject screams for a wider, deeper approach\\". The Glasgow Herald agreed that while it was \\"a fine example of British production\\", it gave the impression of having been \\"cut down to the bone\\". The Sunday Times too felt that in such a short running-time \\"the attempt to cover...the whole task of the Military Government in the British zone is hopeless\\".A Defeated People – what the film reviews said in 1946 Retrieved 28 September 2010 Copyright status A Defeated People is attested to be in the public domain in the United States, and is available for viewing or free download on the Internet Archive.

By 1912 Eaton had taken on another spectacular, but dangerous occupation - motordrome thrill racing. Hazel Marion Eaton was born on July 4, 1895 in the lighthouse tower at West Quoddy Head outside Lubec, Maine where her father, Edwin L. Eaton, was the assistant light keeper (1895–1900). She was the only child born in the candy- striped tower due to construction in the permanent living quarters behind the lighthouse. Her mother, Jennie L. Johnson, a South Portland native, suffered from nausea due to paint fumes in the main house. Her husband ushered her into the tower to seek relief, but she immediately went into labor with Hazel.\\"Just for Remembrance: Retired Showfolk Bring Atmosphere Home.\\" Portland Evening Express Feb 13, 1956: Second Section.

Within two years she met Ira Watkins. Watkins had his own show and lured the adventurous Eaton to train, then participate in “Watkins’s Wall of Death” motordrome. She married Watkins in 1917 and one year later gave birth to her only child, Beverly June Watkins. In 1920, due to the nomadic lifestyle of circus performers, Ira Watkins’s mother, Emma, took custody of Beverly and raised her in Rutland, Vermont. Motordrome career A motordrome, also known as “The Wall of Death,” is a barrel shaped track made of smooth two by four inch boards that bank upward at a 45-60 degree angle. Eaton rode her 1912 Indian motorcycle along the inside of the barrel wall at speeds up to 60 miles per hour – often with no hands. She told a reporter that although the riding appeared to be “clever,” she more or less functioned without really thinking about the danger or what she was doing. Onlookers, who stood at the top of the barrel as riders edged closer and closer to the top, were unaware of the ease with which the riders performed – for the most part. On one occasion, Eaton’s back brake locked during a performance. She tumbled to the bottom of the motordrome and spent several weeks in the hospital suffering from head and facial injuries. While death was common in the motordrome, Eaton’s injuries never stopped her from riding the walls. Hazel Eaton with Beatrice Houdini August 28, 1938. After 15 years trick riding in the motordrome, Eaton divorced Ira Watkins, then purchased and managed her own show for several years, traveling throughout the world and every state in America. She married Jesse Reis, a traveling circus auditor in 1928. Together they continued to contract with circus troupes until 1942. Beatrice Houdini, who became a close friend of the Reis’s and wintered with them in Florida, requested Eaton hold a private seance in her home on Halloween night 1936, simultaneous to other seances held around the country, to connect with Harry Houdini who had died in 1926.\\"Maine Woman Tried to Reach Houdini.\\" Sunday Press Herald. Nov 2, 1956. Print. Beatrice Houdini was on her way to visit the Reis’s Rainbow Farm in Yarmouth, Maine when she died in 1943. Eaton remained in Yarmouth, Maine until 1958 when she moved to Mt. Dora, Florida for health reasons. She died there in December 1970.

Xiaoxiang is less a precise geographic entity than a concept. Xiaoxiang is used in the genre of Xiaoxiang poetry of Classical Chinese poetry and in literature for symbolic purposes, in part because this was a significant area, which at least through the Song dynastic era China was still considered a wild place full of malaria, barbarians, and wild beasts. Indeed, for much of early Chinese history, this area belonged not to China, but to the independent state of Chu. Beginning at least with Qu Yuan, in the third century BCE, this region came to symbolically represent the unjust exile of a talented minister or government official by an unappreciative king or emperor. The following quote succinctly describes the authors who helped shape the literary image of the Xiaoxiang and their feelings in that regard: The name Xiaoxiang comes in part from the name of the Xiang River, which rises in the mountains of Guangxi and flows into Dongting Lake. There is a modern Xiao River, which is a tributary of the Xiang River, and joins it near present-day cities of Yongzhou and Changsha; however, the name Xiaoxiang predates the bestowing of that name on the Xiao River: originally the adjective xiao, meaning \\"clear and deep\\", was used to descriptively for the Xiang River.

(2010). Cumia reticulata (Blainville, 1829). In: MolluscaBase (2017). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=527497 on 2017-11-15 common name the false triton, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Colubrariidae. Out of this family, there are at least 6 species that are known to feed on blood. This trait of feeding on blood is likely shared by the entire family. It is commonly known as the vampire snail because it feeds on the blood of fish when they are asleep. Colubraria reticulata are commonly found in rocky and coral environments that are tropical or subtropical and temperate seas. In addition, they are found in Benthic which is one of the ecological regions of a body of water. It comprises the bottom—such as the ocean floor or the bottom of a lake—the sediment surface, and some sub-surface layers. Description Members of the Neogastropoda are mostly gonochoric and broadcast spawners. The lifecycle of these snails start off as embryos that develop into planktonic trochophore larvae. After the larval stage, they evolve into juvenile veligers before becoming fully grown adults. The length of the shell varies between 10 mm and 64 mm. Distribution The type locality is Sicily. It also occurs off West Africa. They are also located in the Southwest Mediterranean Sea and are not considered as widely dispersed species. Feeding habits The vampire snail feeds at night when fishes are asleep. Their modified mouthpart can slice flesh like tiny scalpels. At the end of their mouth is a mounted proboscis. These snails possess a long thin proboscis to feed on the blood of fish. Once contact is made between the proboscis and the skin of the fish, the proboscis extends its length to gain access to the blood vessel. Their proboscis can stretch 3 times its body length and allows them to bypass many fishes defenses to blood sucking. An example would be the Parrot fish's mucus sleeping bag. =Secretion of Bioactive Molecules= Upon contact with the skin, anesthetic is secreted to numb the area. Colubraria reticulata secretes chemicals that disrupts the process of blood clotting and wound healing. Common anesthetics from protein families ShK, Turripeptide, ADA, and CAP-ShK were found to be present during hematophagy. In addition, anticoagulants such as PS1, Meprin, and Kunitz were also present to prevent blood clotting. The anticoagulants are active until the blood is fully digested. These snails have secondary glands in the oesophagus that secrete proteins to keep the blood liquified in their guts. Furthermore, vasopressives were found and because the proboscis is thin, it is hypothesized for vasopressives to increase blood pressure to allow maximization of blood income and feeding time. This is significant because the snail's proboscis is not very muscular so without vasopressive compounds, they cannot suck blood efficiently. Turritoxin which is unique to the vampire snail, is also produced by coneshell. Although the function of turritoxin is specifically unknown to the vampire snail, scientists have looked towards coneshell and hypothesized that the use of turritoxin is of the same manner.

Bosnian Muslim Waffen-SS volunteers with a Nazi salute. At right is SS General Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig. Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the SS \\"Handschar\\" with a Nazi propaganda pamphlet, Islam und Judentum, in Nazi-occupied Southern France (Bundesarchiv, June 1943) The relationship between Nazi Germany (1933–1945) and the leadership of the Arab world encompassed contempt, propaganda, collaboration, and in some instances emulation. Cooperative political and military relationships were founded on shared hostilities toward common enemies, such as the United Kingdom and the French Third Republic, along with communism, and Zionism. Another key foundation of this collaboration was the anti-Semitism of the Nazis and their hostility towards the United Kingdom and France, which was admired by some Arab and Muslim leaders, most notably the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini (see Anti-Semitism in Islam). In public and private, Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler made warm statements about Islam as a religion and political ideology, describing it as a more disciplined, militaristic, political, and practical form of religion than Christianity, and commending what they perceived to be Muhammad's skill in politics and military leadership. However, the official Nazi racial ideology also considered Arabs and North Africans to be racially inferior to Germans, a sentiment echoed by Hitler and other Nazi leaders to deprecate them. Hitler left no doubt about his disdain for the Arab world, writing in Mein Kampf: \\"As a völkisch man, who appraises the value of men on a racial basis, I am prevented by mere knowledge of the racial inferiority of these so-called 'oppressed nations' from linking the destiny of my own people with theirs\\". The Arabic-speaking world has attracted particular attention from historians examining Fascism beyond Europe. Focusing exclusively on pro- Nazi and pro-Fascist forces, these scholars have tended to emphasize the appeal that Fascism and Nazism had across the Arab world. More recently however, this narrative has been challenged by a number of scholarsAmong them are the works by Peter Wien (2006) and Orit Bashkin (2009) on Iraq, Rene Wildangel (2007) on Palestine, Götz Nordbruch (2009) on Lebanon and Syria, and Israel Gershoni and James Jankowski (2010) on Egypt. who assert that Arab political debates in the 1930s and 1940s were quite complex. Fascism and Nazism, they argue, were discussed alongside other political ideologies, such as communism, liberalism, and constitutionalism. Moreover, the recent revisionist works have stressed the anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi voices and movements in the Arab world. Despite the Mufti's efforts to get German backing for Arab independence, Hitler refused, remarking that he \\"wanted nothing from the Arabs\\". Nazi perceptions of the Arab world In speeches, Hitler purportedly made apparently warm references towards Muslim culture such as: \\"The peoples of Islam will always be closer to us than, for example, France\\".Hitler's apocalypse: Jews and the Nazi legacy, Robert S. Wistrich, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 17 Oct 1985, page 59 Hitler was transcribed as saying: \\"Had Charles Martel not been victorious at Poitiers [...] then we should in all probability have been converted to Mohammedanism, that cult which glorifies the heroism and which opens up the seventh Heaven to the bold warrior alone. Then the Germanic races would have conquered the world.\\" This exchange occurred when Hitler received Saudi Arabian ruler Ibn Saud's special envoy, Khalid al-Hud al-Gargani.The Arabs and the Holocaust: The Arab-Israeli War of Narratives, by Gilbert Achcar, (NY: Henry Holt and Co.; 2009), pp. 125—126. Earlier in this meeting, Hitler noted that one of the three reasons why Nazi Germany had some interest in the Arabs was: Gilbert Achcar observes that the Führer did not point out to his Arab visitors at that meeting that until then he had incited German Jews to emigrate to Palestine (see Aliyah Bet and Timeline of the Holocaust), and the Third Reich actively helped Zionist organizations get around British-imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration.\\"Arabs & Holocaust, Achcar\\" p. 125. Hitler had told his military commanders in 1939, shortly before the beginning of World War II: \\"We shall continue to make disturbances in the Far East and in Arabia. Let us think as men and let us see in these peoples at best lacquered half-apes who are anxious to experience the lash.\\" Prior to the Second World War, all of North Africa and the Middle East were under the rule of European colonial powers. Despite the Nazi racial theory which denigrated Arabs as members of an inferior race, individual Arabs who assisted the Third Reich in fighting against the Allies were treated with dignity and respect. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, for example, \\"was granted honorary Aryan\\" status by the Nazis for his close collaboration with Hitler and the Third Reich. The Nazi government developed a cordial association and cooperated with some Arab nationalist leaders based on their common enemies and shared distaste towards Jews and Zionism. The most notable examples of these common-cause fights were the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine and other actions led by Amin al- Husseini, and the Anglo-Iraqi War, when the Golden Square (four generals led by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani) overthrew the pro-British 'Abd al-Ilah regency in Iraq and installed a pro-Axis government.Nafi, Basheer M. \\"The Arabs and the Axis: 1933-1940\\".

Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Book. , 10: 0-8117-3250-9. p. 141 In response to the Rashid Ali coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive No. 30 on 23 May 1941, to support their cause. This order began: \\"The Arab Freedom Movement in the Middle East is our natural ally against England.\\" On 11 June 1941, Hitler and the supreme commander of the armed forces issued Directive No. 32: Arab perceptions of Hitler and Nazism According to Gilbert Achcar, there was no unified Arab perception of Nazism: Hitler and fascist ideology were controversial in the Arab world, just as they were in Europe, with both supporters and opponents. Massive programs of propaganda were launched in the Arab world, first by Fascist Italy and later on by Nazi Germany. The Nazis in particular focused on impacting the new generation of political thinkers and activists. Erwin Rommel was almost as popular as Hitler. \\"Heil Rommel\\" was reportedly a common greeting in Arab countries. Some believed the Germans would help them in gaining independence from French and British rule. After France's defeat by Nazi Germany in 1940, some Arabs were making public chants against the French and British in the streets of Damascus: \\"No more Monsieur, no more Mister, Allah's in Heaven and Hitler's on earth.\\" Posters in Arabic stating \\"In heaven God is your ruler, on earth Hitler\\" were frequently displayed in shops in the towns of Syria. Some wealthy Arabs who traveled to Germany in the 1930s brought back fascist ideals and incorporated them into Arab nationalism. One of the principal founders of Ba'athist thought and the Ba'ath Party, Zaki al-Arsuzi, stated that Fascism and Nazism had greatly influenced Ba'athist ideology. A student of al-Arsuzi, Sami al-Jundi, wrote: > We were racialists, admiring Nazism, reading its books and the source of its > thought, particularly Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra, Fichte's Addresses > to the German Nation, and H.

We were the first to think of translating Mein > Kampf. Whoever has lived during this period in Damascus will appreciate the > inclination of the Arab people to Nazism, for Nazism was the power which > could serve as its champion, and he who is defeated will by nature love the > victor. But our belief was rather different. Amin al-Husseini and Adolf Hitler on 28 November 1941 The two most noted Arab politicians who actively collaborated with the Nazis were the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, and the Iraqi prime minister Rashid Ali al- Gaylani. The British sent Amin al-Husseini into exile for his role in the Palestinian revolt of 1936-39. The ex-Mufti had agents in the Kingdom of Iraq, the French Mandate of Syria and in Mandatory Palestine. In 1941, al-Husseini actively supported the Iraqi Golden Square coup d'état, led by Rashid Ali al- Gaylani. After the Golden Square Iraqi regime was defeated by British forces, Rashid Ali, al-Husseini and other Iraqi veterans took refuge in Europe, where they supported Axis interests. They were particularly successful in recruiting several tens-of-thousands of Muslims for membership in German Schutzstaffel (SS) units, and as propagandists for the Arabic-speaking world. The range of collaborative activities was wide. For instance, Anwar Sadat, who later became president of Egypt, was a willing co-operator in Nazi Germany's espionage according to his own memoirs. Adolf Hitler met with Amin al-Husseini on 28 November 1941. The official German notes of that meeting contain numerous references to combatting Jews both inside and outside Europe. The following excerpts from that meeting are statements from Hitler to al-Husseini: > Germany stood for uncompromising war against the Jews. That naturally > included active opposition to the Jewish national home in Palestine, which > was nothing other than a center, in the form of a state, for the exercise of > destructive influence by Jewish interests. ... This was the decisive > struggle; on the political plane, it presented itself in the main as a > conflict between Germany and England, but ideologically it was a battle > between National Socialism and the Jews. It went without saying that Germany > would furnish positive and practical aid to the Arabs involved in the same > struggle, because platonic promises were useless in a war for survival or > destruction in which the Jews were able to mobilize all of England's power > for their ends....the Fuhrer would on his own give the Arab world the > assurance that its hour of liberation had arrived. Germany's objective would > then be solely the destruction of the Jewish element residing in the Arab > sphere under the protection of British power. In that hour the Mufti would > be the most authoritative spokesman for the Arab world. It would then be his > task to set off the Arab operations, which he had secretly prepared. When > that time had come, Germany could also be indifferent to French reaction to > such a declaration.Documents on German Foreign Policy 1918–1945, Series D, > Vol XIII, London, 1964, p. 881Akten zur deutschen auswärtigen Politik, > Series D, Vol. XIII, 2, No. 515Hitlers Weisungen für die Kriegführung > 1939–1945, ed. by Walther Hubatsch (Frankfurt: Bernard und Graefe, 1962) pp. > 129–39 Amin al-Husseini became the most prominent Arab collaborator with the Axis powers. He developed friendships with high-ranking Nazis, including Heinrich Himmler, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and (possibly) Adolf Eichmann. He contributed to Axis propaganda services and to the recruitment of Muslim and Arab soldiers for the Nazi armed forces, including three SS divisions consisting of Bosnian Muslims. He was involved in planning \\"wartime operations directed against Palestine and Iraq, including parachuting Germans and Arab agents to foment attacks against the Jews in Palestine.\\"Nazi War Crimes & Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group Final Report to the United States Congress April 2007, 1-880875-30-6, , p. 87 He assisted the German entry into North Africa, particularly the German entry into Tunisia and Libya. His espionage network provided the Wehrmacht with a forty-eight-hour warning of the Allied invasion of North Africa. The Wehrmacht, however, ignored this information, which turned out to be completely accurate. He intervened and protested to government authorities in order to prevent Jews from emigrating to Mandatory Palestine.Collins, Larry and Lapierre, Dominique (1972): O Jerusalem!, Simon & Schuster, ., pp. 49, 50 There is persuasive evidence that he was aware of the Nazi Final Solution.Collins & Lapierre, pp. 49, 50 : \\"Fully aware of the Final Solution, he had done his best to see that none of the intended victims were diverted to Palestine on their way to Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler's gas chambers.\\" After the war ended, he claimed that he never knew about the extermination camps or Nazi plans for the genocide of European Jews, that the evidence against him was forged by his Jewish enemies, and even denied having met Eichmann. He is still a controversial figure, both vilified and honored by different political factions in the contemporary Arab world.Achcar 2009, p. 154 Researchers like Jeffrey Herf, Meir Zamir, and Hans Goldenbaum agree on the importance of the German propaganda effort in the Middle East and North Africa. But latest research on the massive and influential radio broadcasts was able to prove \\"that the texts were supplied by German personnel and not, as sometimes believed, by the reader[s] of the Arabic broadcasts [...]\\". Furthermore, Goldenbaum concludes \\"that the man who was long regarded as the Reich's most important Muslim of all, Mohammed Amin al-Husseini, the Mufti of Jerusalem, did not play any particularly important role in this case. Despite the fact that his Arabic speeches were broadcast by Radio Berlin and he was always presented as a role model, al-Husseini did not have any influence on the broadcast content. The Arabs in general did not seem to have been partners with equal rights. Instead they were secondary recipients of propaganda and orders, Goldenbaum concluded. Cooperation never went beyond the emphasized common battle against colonialism.\\"Delving Into Nazi Germany's Arabic Language Propaganda, Sven F.

Die deutsche Rundfunkpropaganda für die arabische Welt, Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte. Volume 64, Issue 3, Pages 449–490 Opposition Gilbert Achcar, a professor of Development Studies at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, argues that historical narratives often over-emphasize collaboration and under-appreciate progressive Arab political history, overshadowing the many dimensions of conflict between Nazism and the Arab World. He accuses Zionists of promulgating a 'collaborationist' narrative for partisan purposes. He proposes that the dominant Arab political attitudes were 'anti-colonialism' and 'anti-Zionism,' though only a comparatively small faction adopted anti-Semitism, and most Arabs were actually pro-Ally and anti-Axis (as evidenced by the high number of Arabs who fought for Allied forces). Achcar states: > The Zionist narrative of the Arab world is based centrally around one figure > who is ubiquitous in this whole issue—the Jerusalem Grand Mufti Hajj Amin > al-Husseini, who collaborated with the Nazis. But the historical record is > actually quite diverse. The initial reaction to Nazism and Hitler in the > Arab world and especially from the intellectual elite was very critical > towards Nazism, which was perceived as a totalitarian, racist and > imperialist phenomenon. It was criticized by the liberals or what I call the > liberal Westernizers, i.e. those who were attracted by Western liberalism, > as well as by the Marxists and left-wing nationalists who denounced Nazism > as another form of imperialism. In fact, only one of the major ideological > currents in the Arab world developed a strong affinity with Western anti- > Semitism, and that was Islamic fundamentalism—not all Islam or Islamic > movements but those with the most reactionary interpretations of Islam. They > reacted to what was happening in Palestine by espousing Western anti-Semitic > attitudes.The Holocaust Palestine and the Arab World: Gilbert Achcar > interviewed 26 August 2014 Cooperation =Mandatory Palestine= The Palestinian Arab and Nazi political leaders said that they had a common cause against \\"International Jewry\\". However, the most significant practical effect of Nazi anti-Jewish policy between 1933 and 1942 was to radically increase the immigration rate of German and other European Jews to Palestine and to double the population of Palestinian Jews. Al-Husseini had sent messages to Berlin through , the German consul general in Jerusalem, endorsing the advent of the Nazi regime as early as March 1933, and was enthusiastic over the Nazi anti-Jewish policy, and particularly the anti-Jewish boycott in Nazi Germany. \\"[The Mufti and other sheikhs asked] only that German Jews not be sent to Palestine.\\"\\"Arabs & Holocaust, Achcar\\" p. 135 Nazi policy for solving their Jewish problem until the end of 1937 emphasized motivating German Jews to emigrate from German territory. During this period the League of Nations Mandate for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Mandatory Palestine to be used as a refuge for Jews was \\"still internationally recognized\\". The Gestapo and the SS inconsistently cooperated with a variety of Jewish organizations and efforts (e.g., Hanotaiah Ltd., the Anglo-Palestine Bank, the Temple Society Bank, HIAS, Joint Distribution Committee, Revisionist Zionists, and others), most notably in the Haavurah Agreements, to facilitate emigration to Mandatory Palestine.\\"The Mufti of Jerusalem and the Nazis: The Berlin Years\\" by Klaus Gensicke, translated by Alexander Fraser Gunn ( London & Portland, OR: Vallentine Mitchell ;2011); Original edition: \\"Der Mufti von Jerusalem\\" (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft; 2007), pp. 26—28 Nora Levin wrote in 1968: \\"Up to the middle of 1938, Palestine had received one third of all the Jews who had emigrated from Germany since 1933 – 50,000 out of a total of 150,000.\\"The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933-1945, by Nora Levin, (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company; 1968) p. 130 Edwin Black, benefitting from more modern scholarship, has written that 60,000 German Jews immigrated into Palestine between 1933 through 1936, bringing with them $100,000,000 dollars ($1.6 billion in 2009 dollars). This precipitous increase in the Jewish Palestinian population stimulated Palestinian Arab political resistance to continued Jewish immigration, and was a principal cause for the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, which in turn led to the British White Paper decision to abandon the League of Nations Mandate to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine. The resultant change in British policy effectively closed Palestine to most European Jews who were fleeing Nazi persecution during World War II. After 1938 the majority of Zionist organizations adhered to a strategy of \\"Fighting the White Paper as if there was not War, and fighting the War as if there was no White Paper\\". Zionists would smuggle Jews in Palestine whenever possible, regardless if this brought them into conflict with the British authorities. At the same time, the Zionists and other Jews would ally themselves to the British struggle against Germany and the Axis powers, even while the British authorities refused to allow the migration of European Jews into Palestine.\\"The Transfer Agreement: The Dramatic Story of the Pact between the Third Reich and Jewish Palestine\\" by Edwin Black (New York: First Dialog; 2009) In 1938 the German policy toward the Jewish homeland in Palestine appears to have substantially changed, as indicated in this German Ministry of Foreign Affairs note from 10 March 1938: > The influx into Palestine of German capital in Jewish hands will facilitate > the building up of a Jewish state, which runs counter to German interests; > for this state, instead of absorbing world Jewry, will someday bring about a > considerable increase in world Jewry's political power.\\"The Holocaust\\" > (1968), p. 131 One consequence of al-Husseini's opposition to Britain's mandate in Palestine and his rejection of the British attempts to work out a compromise between Zionists and Palestinian Arabs was that the Mufti was exiled from Palestine. Many of his followers, who had fought in guerilla campaigns against Jews and the British in Palestine, followed him and continued to work for his political goals. Among the most notable Palestinian soldiers in this category was Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, a kinsman and officer of al-Husseini who had been wounded twice in the early stages of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Al- Husseini sent Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni to Germany in 1938 for explosives training. Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni then worked with al-Husseini to support the Golden Square regime, and consequently was tried and sent to prison by the British after they recaptured Iraq. He subsequently became the popular leader of approximately 50,000 Palestinian Arabs who joined the Mufti's Army of the Holy War during the 1947-1948 Arab–Israeli War. His fellow Iraq-veteran and German collaborator Fawzi al-Qawuqji became a rival general in that same struggle against Zionism.Collins and Lapierre, pp. 86–88 After the Kristallnacht pogroms in November 1938, most Jewish and Zionist organizations aligned with Britain and its allies to oppose Nazi Germany. After this time the organized assistance by the Gestapo to the Jewish organizations who transported European Jews to Palestine became much more sporadic, although bribery of individual Germans often help accomplish such operations even after official policy discouraged them.\\"The Holocaust\\" (1968) Al-Husseini opposed all immigration of Jews into Palestine. His numerous letters appealing to various governmental authorities to prevent Jewish emigration to Palestine have been widely republished and cited as documentary evidence of his collaboration with the Nazis and his participative support for their actions. For instance, in June 1943, al-Husseini recommended to the Hungarian minister that it would be better to send the Jewish population of Hungary to the Nazi concentration camps in Poland rather than let them find asylum in Palestine (it is not entirely clear whether al-Husseini was aware of the extermination camps in Poland, e.g. Auschwitz, at this time): > I ask your Excellency to permit me to draw your attention to the necessity > of preventing the Jews from leaving your country for Palestine, and if there > are reasons which make their removal necessary, it would be indispensable > and infinitely preferable to send them to other countries where they would > find themselves under active control, for example, in Poland ...\\"Arabs & > Holocaust, Achcar\\" p. 148 Amin al-Husseini meeting with Heinrich Himmler (1943) Achcar quotes al- Husseini's memoirs about these efforts to influence the Axis powers to prevent emigration of Eastern European Jews to Palestine: > We combatted this enterprise by writing to Ribbentrop, Himmler, and Hitler, > and, thereafter, the governments of Italy, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, > Turkey, and other countries. We succeeded in foiling this initiative, a > circumstance that led the Jews to make terrible accusations against me, in > which they held me accountable for the liquidation of four hundred thousand > Jews who were unable to emigrate to Palestine in this period. They added > that I should be tried as a war criminal in Nuremberg.\\"Arabs & Holocaust, > Achcar\\" pp. 145–146 Achcar then notes that although al-Husseini's motivation to block Jewish emigration into Palestine: > was certainly legitimate when it was addressed as an appeal to the British > mandatory authorities ... It had no legitimacy whatsoever when addressed to > Nazi authorities who had cooperated with the Zionists to send tens of > thousands of German Jews to Palestine and then set out to exterminate the > Jews of Europe.

Germany is also struggling > against the common foe who oppressed Arabs and Muhammadans in their > different countries. It has very clearly recognized the Jews for what they > are and resolved to find a definitive solution [] for the Jewish danger that > will eliminate the scourge that Jews represent in the world.\\"Arabs & > Holocaust, Achcar\\" pp. 151–152 = Kingdom of Iraq = On 1 April 1941, a day after General Erwin Rommel began his Tunisian offensive, the 1941 Iraqi coup d'état overthrew the pro- British Kingdom of Iraq. Fritz Grobba served intermittently as the German ambassador in Iraq from 1932 to 1941, supporting anti-Jewish and fascist movements in the Arab world. Intellectuals and army officers were invited to Germany as guests of the Nazi party, and antisemitic material was published in the newspapers. The German embassy purchased the newspaper al-Alam al-Arabi (\\"The Arab World\\") which published antisemitic, anti-British, and pro-Nazi propaganda, including a serialized translation of Hitler's Mein Kampf in Arabic.Podeh, et al, 2006, p. 135 While Nazi Germany was not openly allied with the Ba'athist government in Iraq like Fascist Italy was during the Anglo- Iraqi War,\\"Italy and Saudi Arabia confronting the challenges of the XXI century\\" p.20 it provided air support. On 1–2 June 1941, immediately after the collapse of the pro-Fascist Rashid Ali government in Iraq, al-Husseini and others inspired a pogrom against the Jewish population of Baghdad known as \\"the Farhud\\". The estimates of Jewish victims vary from less than 110 to over 600 killed, and from 240 to 2000 wounded. Gilbert Achcar claims that historian Bernard Lewis cites the numbers (officially 600 killed and 240 injured, with unofficial sources being \\"much higher\\") as the number of Jewish victims, without citing a single reference.\\"Arabs & Holocaust, Achcar, pp. 100-101\\" Edwin Black concludes that the exact numbers will never be known, pointing out the improbability of the initial estimate in the official reports of 110 fatalities that included both Arabs and Jews (including 28 women), as opposed to the claims of Jewish sources that as many as 600 Jews were killed.Edwin Black (2010). The Farhud: Roots of the Arab-Nazi Alliance in the Holocaust. Washington, DC: Dialog Press. , p. 186 Similarly, the estimates of Jewish homes destroyed range from 99 to over 900 houses. Though these figures are debated in the secondary literature, it is generally agreed that over 580 Jewish businesses were looted. The Iraqi-Arab Futuwwa youth group—modeled after the Hitler Youth—were widely credited with the Farhud. The Futuwwa were commanded by Iraqi minister of education Saib Shawkat, who also praised Hitler for eradicating Jews.Lewis, Bernard. Semites and Anti-Semites. 1999, p. 158 In June 1941, Wehrmacht High Command Directive No. 32 and the \\"Instructions for Special Staff F\\" designated Special Staff F as the Wehrmacht's central agency for all issues that affected the Arab world.\\"German Exploitation of Arab Nationalist Movements in World War II\\" by Gen. Hellmuth Felmy and Gen, Walter Warlimont, Historical Division, Headquarters, United States Army, Europe, Foreign Military Studies Branch, 1952, p. 11, by Gen. Haider =North Africa= The Algerian Saïd Mohammedi (on the left) assisted the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) during World War II, after which he joined the Algerian Revolution in 1954. On 20 January 1942, 15 high-ranking Nazi Party and German government officials met at a villa in Wannsee, a Berlin suburb, to coordinate the execution of the \\"Final Solution\\" (Endlösung) of the Jewish Question. At this Wannsee Conference, Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler's deputy and head of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Security Main Office, or RSHA), noted the numbers of Jews to be eliminated in each territory. In the notation for France there are two entries, 165,000 for Occupied France, and 700,000 for the Unoccupied Zone, which included France's North African possessions, i.e. Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.Atlas of the Holocaust, by Martin Gilbert (New York: William Morrow & Company; 1993) The SS had established a special unit of 22 people in 1942 \\"to Kill Jews in North Africa\\". It was led by the SS functionary Walter Rauff, who helped develop the mobile gassing vehicles the Germans used to murder Russian prisoners and Jewish people in Russia and Poland. A network of labor camps was established in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco.Among the Righteous: Lost Stories from the Holocaust's Long Reach Into Arab Lands, by Robert B. Satloff (New York: Public Affairs; 2006), p.209 Over 2,500 Tunisian Jews perished during a six-month period in these camps.Satloff, pp 57–72 According to Robert Satloff, only one Arab in North Africa, Hassan Ferjani, was convicted by an Allied military tribunal in World War II for performing actions that led to the deaths of Jews, male members of the Scemla family of Tunisia, while many Arabs acted to save Jews.Satloff, p. 15 For instance, King Mohammed V refused to make the 200,000 Jews who were living in Morocco wear yellow stars, even though this discriminatory practice was enforced in France. He is reported to have said: \\"There are no Jews in Morocco. There are only subjects.\\"\\"Moroccan Jews pay homage to 'protector. Haaretz. Associated Press. 28 January 2005. The historian Haim Saadon opines that bar some exceptions, there was no violence towards Jews from Muslims and that although there was no particular sense of camaraderie, Jews and Muslims treated each other quite well. =Arab exiles in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy= Following the defeat of the Golden Square in Iraq in May–June 1941, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani fled to Iran but was not to stay long. On 25 August 1941, Anglo-Soviet forces invaded Iran, removing Reza Shah from power. Gaylani then fled to German-occupied Europe. In Berlin, he was received by German dictator Adolf Hitler, and he was recognized as the leader of the Iraqi government in exile. Upon the defeat of Germany, Gaylani again fled and found refuge, this time in Saudi Arabia. Amin al-Husseini arrived in Rome on 10 October 1941. He outlined his proposals before Alberto Ponce de Leon. On condition that the Axis powers \\"recognize in principle the unity, independence, and sovereignty, of an Arab state, including Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Transjordan\\", he offered support in the war against Britain and stated his willingness to discuss the issues of \\"the Holy Places, Lebanon, the Suez Canal, and Aqaba\\". The Italian foreign ministry approved al-Husseini's proposal, recommended giving him a grant of one million lire, and referred him to Benito Mussolini, who met al-Husseini on 27 October. According to al- Husseini's account, it was an amicable meeting in which Mussolini expressed his hostility to the Jews and Zionism. Back in the summer of 1940 and again in February 1941, al-Husseini submitted to the Nazi German Government a draft declaration of German-Arab cooperation, containing a clause: > Germany and Italy recognize the right of the Arab countries to solve the > question of the Jewish elements, which exist in Palestine and in the other > Arab countries, as required by the national and ethnic (völkisch) interests > of the Arabs, and as the Jewish question was solved in Germany and Italy. Al-Husseini helped organize Arab students and North African emigres in Germany into the Free Arabian Legion in the German Army that hunted down Allied parachutists in the Balkans and fought on the Russian front. Arab incorporation and emulation of Nazism Several emerging movements in the Arab world were influenced by European fascist and Nazi organizations during the 1930s. The Young Egypt Party (\\"Green shirts\\") closely resembled the Hitler Youth and was \\"obviously Nazi in form\\", according to historian Bernard Lewis. The fascist pan-Arabist Al-Muthanna Club and its al-Futuwwa (Hitler Youth) typeEncyclopedia of the Modern Middle East & North Africa: D-K Por Philip Mattar, p. 860 movement, participated in the 1941 Farhud attack on Baghdad's Jewish community.Memories of state: politics, history, and collective identity in modern Iraq by Eric Davis Eric Davis, University of California Press, 2005, P. 14http://www.fpri.org/orbis/4902/davis.historymattersiraq.pdf The Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) adopted styles of fascism. Its emblem, the red hurricane, was taken from the Nazi swastika, leader Antoun Saadeh was known as al-za'im (the leader), and the party anthem was \\"Syria, Syria, über alles\\" sung to the same tune as the German national anthem. He founded the fascist SSNP with a program that Syrians were \\"a distinctive and naturally superior race\\".

Unlike many other countries in Africa, Rwanda has been a unified state since precolonial times, populated by the Banyarwanda people who share a single language and cultural heritage.Prunier (1995), p. 15 Eleven regular national holidays are observed throughout the year, with others occasionally inserted by the government.Embassy of Rwanda in Sudan The week following Genocide Memorial Day on 7 April is designated an official week of mourning.Briggs and Booth (2006), p. 61 The last Saturday of each month is umuganda, a national day of community service, during which most normal services close down.  Music and dance  Traditional Rwandan Intore dancers. Traditional dance in Rwanda Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling.Briggs and Booth (2006), p. 29 The most famous traditional dance is Intore, a highly choreographed routine consisting of three components - the ballet, performed by women; the dance of heroes, performed by men, and the drums.Rwanda Direct Traditionally, music is transmitted orally with styles varying between the social groups. Drums are of great importance, the royal drummers having enjoyed high status within the court of the mwami. Drummers usually play together in groups of seven or nine. Rwanda has a growing popular music industry, influenced by East African, Congolese and American music. The most popular genres are hip-hop and R&B;, often blended with ragga and dance-pop. Popular local artists include The Ben and Meddy, both of whom have won awards,Mbabazi (II) and more recent artists like Miss Shanel, Kitoko, Riderman, Tom Close, King James, Mani Martin, Knowless, Charly na Nina and others.  Cuisine  Beer is drunk from containers such as this at rituals and ceremonies. Rwandan cuisine is based on local staple foods produced by the traditional subsistence agriculture. Historically, it has varied among the country's different ethnic groups. Rwandan staples include bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular.Adekunle (2007), p. 81 The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is now also very popular.Adekunle (2007), p. 13 Ugali (or ubugali) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water, to form a porridge- like consistency that is eaten throughout East Africa.Auzias (2007), p. 74 Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as melange, consisting of the above staples and possibly meat. Brochette is the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat, but sometimes tripe, beef, pork or fish.Briggs and Booth (2006), p. 66 In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. Commercial beers brewed in Rwanda include Primus, Mützig, and Amstel.  Arts and crafts  Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, although most originated as functional items rather than purely for decoration.Briggs and Booth (2006), p. 31 Woven baskets and bowls are especially common.West (?), p. 17. The south east of Rwanda is noted for imigongo, a unique cow dung art, whose history dates back to when the region was part of the independent Gisaka kingdom. The dung is mixed with natural soils of various colours and painted into patterned ridges, forming geometric shapes.Briggs and Booth (2006), pp. 243-244 Otherart and crafts include pottery/ceramic, painting and wood carving are made mostly by artist students from Ecole d'Art de Nyundo, the unique school of art Rwanda had from 1959 until today, wherever they are another different institutions who are trying to train visual and audio arts in this days.  Housing  The quantity of housing production is still low and its cost does not match the purchasing power of the majority. Most urban residents still access housing through informal practices, because the formal sector cannot offer housing access schemes which cater to all. A number of circumstances result in the situation where most housing developments address only a minority of customers, among whom demand has not even been saturated yet. Currently, while Kigali hosts about half of the urban population in Rwanda, a Housing Market Study for Kigali (2012-22) estimates that total housing needs (2012-22) reach 458,256 units, of which 344,068 are newly to be constructed. Broken down to different purchasing powers, this was translated to: -43,436 units for social housing (12.6%); \\\\- 186,163 units for affordable housing (54.1%); \\\\- 112,867 units for mid-range housing (32.8%); and \\\\- 1,601 units for premium housing (0.5%), for Kigali alone. Countrywide, the demand has not been thoroughly researched yet and studies are in preparation; it is estimated double of the total need in Kigali. The achievements of the recent years relate to improved participation in planning, openness to the use of local materials in construction, and the equal acknowledgement of tenure rights. Risen awareness, small scale research, and project trials in the housing sector have contributed to this. The improvement of neighbourhood planning and of the general urban planning framework is underway, which provides for consistency in planning and development management. Despite the constraints which still exist in housing finance, lending conditions have improved through the introduction of longer credit terms, slightly reducing interest rates, a larger and more accessible variety in terms of down-payment options, and improvements in the accessibility of the building permitting system in relation to mortgage rules (National Housing Policy).  Housing Development  The Government engages in partnerships for housing development for a sustainable, mixed-use housing neighbourhood development based on a PPP model first tested in 2008 when 250 low cost houses were built, which among other innovations made local materials bankable. An estimated 22,000 housing units are currently in different stages of preparation, to be developed by the private sector with government support. There is a 2-fold strategy to 1) trigger large scale investment into affordable housing and create competition by using the identified and available land, and 2) trigger and facilitate medium- to smallscale investment into affordable housing through collaborative development schemes, which would enable small landholders, participate in development in form of cooperatives or as investment shareholders. The local production of construction material is gradually being increased, e.g. local production of cement, of improved and environmentally friendlier bricks, and new, innovative and home-made solutions for structural and non-structural walling materials. See attached photo. The Housing Sector and the Construction Industry are continuously growing in Rwanda. The Construction Industry plays an important role in the development strategy of any country that goes beyond its share in national output. Many writers have referred to its effect on employment creation, others to its multiplier effects in the national economy. It is the great flexibility of construction activity in adjusting to different framework conditions that makes this particular sector of the economy a major contributor to the process of economic growth and development (Lopes et al., 2002). see attached growth curve Aligned with our national program and strategies, Vision 2020, Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (EDPRSII), Urban and Rural Settlement Sector Strategic Plan (2012/13-17/18), the role of the Ministry in the sector is to establish policies, strategies and program that will ensure that: \\\\- The safety and the general welfare of its population is prioritized; \\\\- The development of the sector contributes to the national economic growth; \\\\- The land is used efficiently; \\\\- Energy efficiency and environmentally friendly construction is encouraged; \\\\- The local production of construction material is facilitated; and \\\\- The private sector is empowered to drive the sector.  Literature and film  Rwanda does not have a long history of written literature, but there is a strong oral tradition ranging from poetry to folk stories. In particular the pre-colonial royal court developed traditions of ibitekerezo (epic musical poetry), ubucurabwenge (royal genealogies typically recited at coronation ceremonies), and ibisigo (royal poems).Adekunle (2007), p. 49 Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations. The most famous Rwandan literary figure was Alexis Kagame (1912-1981), who carried out and published research into the oral tradition as well as writing his own poetry. The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as Benjamin Sehene. A number of films have been produced about the genocide, including the Golden Globe nominated Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs, which was filmed in Rwanda itself, and featured survivors in the cast.

Early life and education  A summa cum laude graduate of Vassar College in 1974, Nissenson received her J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1977, where she was the first woman elected president of the law students' association in that institution's history.  Broadcast journalism career  After practicing briefly as a corporate litigator with the Chicago firm of Hopkins & Sutter, Nissenson was hired as chief investigator of the consumer affairs unit (Factfinder) at WBBM-TV Chicago. She received her first Emmy Award eight months later for her investigative reports into violations of child labor laws—a series also honored with a Silver Gavel Award from the American Bar Association in 1979,, p. 36 a Jacob Scher Award for investigative reporting, and a Peter Lisagor Award. In 1980, Nissenson was hired as a reporter/documentarian for WTVJ-Miami. Shortly thereafter, Nissenson went to Israel and Poland to produce Pages of Testimony, which documented a Holocaust survivor's return to Auschwitz and the donation of the Auschwitz Album, a valuable pictorial record of the Holocaust, to the Yad Vashem Museum in Jerusalem. While in Warsaw, Nissenson was asked by CBS Network News to cover Lech Walesa's Solidarity Movement and ensuing labor strikes which led to the democratization of Poland. Nissenson's series of reports, Poland: Changing Nation, received a George Foster Peabody Award, p. 42 (television's equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize) just two months after she had begun her first full-time on-air reporting job. Nissenson was hired by NBC Network News in 1982, where, in addition to being a correspondent on three presidential campaigns, she sometimes guest-anchored on Today, NBC News at Sunrise, NBC News Overnight and NBC News Digest. She left the network in 1985 to report and anchor for WABC-TV in New York. From 1987 until 1988, Nissenson worked as a reporter at WBBM-TV in Chicago. In an interview with Chicago Sun-Times TV columnist Robert Feder, Nissenson denied that she resigned from the station in May 1988 because she was unable to obtain an anchor slot at the station. \\"I simply want to be my own person,\\" she told Feder.  Career as an entrepreneur  In 1988, Nissenson formed Foresight Communications, Inc. (FCI). FCI's worked with Fortune 500 companies to divert monies from traditional marketing and advertising to public service ventures, earning Nissenson recognition as one of the \\"Socially Responsible Entrepreneurs of the Year\\" by INC Magazine and induction into the Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame. During this same period, she and husband Bill Scheer (now deceased), founded Assignment Desk, Inc. the first worldwide fully computerized booking agency for videographers. Nissenson's company, Foresight Communications, Inc., served as principal architect (Agency of Record) for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month for its first decade.  Plastic surgery mishap  In 1995, a disastrous plastic surgery mishap left Nissenson homebound and disabled with an incurable pain condition, then known as cranial reflex sympathetic dystrophy \\\\- ranked alongside terminal bone cancer as one of the most painful conditions in the world. The mishap was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, in countless newspapers and magazines, and several documentaries, including America the Beautiful (2007). She spent most of the next 14 years bedridden. During this period, Nissenson founded the Triumph Over Pain Foundation, one of the first pain patient advocacy groups in the country, and wrote a column to offer advice and encouragement to other pain patients. She also became an accomplished self-taught glass artisan and award-winning jewelry designer and opened the Bali Muse gallery in Chicago, whose revenues supported the work of her pain foundation. Left by her husband and dropped by her insurance company, Nissenson lost her home and life savings, paying for medical expenses well into the millions of dollars. In 2007, she moved to Kauai in the hopes of healing and regaining her strength.  Later years  Nissenson spent the final years of her life living in Sausalito, California, where she was an instructor of graduate multi-media at San Francisco's Academy of Art University. She also formed Global Gravitas, Inc. (a 501c3) which specializes in strategic planning for international peace summits and global healthcare campaigns. Among their current projects are: A.M.E.N. (the first global campaign to fight MRSA) in cooperation with the President of the US Federation for Middle East Peace, and OMG (Obesity Must Go) a nationwide campaign to combat childhood obesity, in support of First Lady Michelle Obama's \\"Let's Move\\" efforts. Nissenson died of septic shock on October 23, 2017.  Personal life  Nissenson was married first to a lawyer, Michael Sweeney, and then to Chicago TV reporter Mike Parker until 1989, when they divorced. She married Bill Scheer in 1994, and the couple divorced several years later.

The Bermuda rig can be split into two groups: the masthead rig and the fractional rig. The masthead rig has larger and more headsails, and a smaller mainsail, compared to the fractional rig. The major advantage a masthead sloop has over a fractional one, is that the jib is larger. Since the jib has no mast in front of it to cause turbulent airflow over it, it is considered much more efficient than the main, especially for sailing up wind. Also, since the fore stay is attached to the top of the mast, it pulls directly against the back stay. Tightening the back stay, then, increases the tension on the fore stay. This is useful because the jib needs considerable fore stay tension to set well. This need increases in direct proportion to the wind speed and jib size. Increasing the tension on the back stay does not tend to bend the mast, as it would on a fractional sloop. It puts the mast in compression instead. For this reason the mast on a mast head rig has a thicker section at the top to stand this load. One reason this rig is used on oceangoing boats is that it can be made quite strong as every part of it, except the boom, is in either tension or compression. This rig requires a much stiffer hull than a fractional sloop rig to take these rigging loads, so is not well suited for lightly built boats. A major disadvantage is that, to shorten sail, the jib must be reefed as well as the main. If the jib is taken in and the main left standing, the main will have a strong tendency to weathercock the boat into the wind, making it uncontrollable. There are four typical remedies used: 1.) put reef points in the jib, 2.) have a smaller jib to set in place of the full sized one, 3.) have a roller furling mechanism that rolls up the jib like window shade, and 4.) have two jibs instead of one (often referred to as a 'cutter' rig), so one of the jibs can be taken in.

He was born in Bissen and attended primary school there, later attending the Athénée in Luxembourg City, and the Lycée classique in Diekirch. He then attended the teacher training college in Ettelbrück from 1937, and became a primary school teacher in Moestroff in 1941. In October 1940 he founded the Lëtzebuerger Legio'n (Luxembourg Legion), which a year later merged with a group of Scouts to become the Letzeburger Vollekslegio'n (Luxembourg People's Legion). Raths hid refugees and Resistance members from the authorities, helped them to escape to France and provided fake documents for them. He also coordinated the espionage activities of the LVL. He was arrested on 19 February 1942 and dismissed from his teaching post, but was released due to lack of evidence on 14 July 1942. He participated in organising the general strike, and in 1943 was made to join the Reichsarbeitsdienst, and then the Wehrmacht. At the Eastern Front, he was again arrested in November 1943 and brought back to Luxembourg, where he managed to escape from custody. Until the liberation, he lived in hiding and was active in the Resistance. When the war ended he returned to teaching, in Bissen, Kleinbettingen, Luxembourg and Cessange. From 1962 to 1970 he was a teacher at the Grand Duke's court, and until 1986 at the ISERP, the teacher training college. From 1975 to 1986 he also taught at the \\"Cours universitaires“.

The mine is located in Kiruna in Norrbotten County, Lapland, Sweden. The mine is owned by Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB), a large Swedish mining company. In 2018 the mine produced 26.9 million tonnes of iron ore. The Kiruna mine has an ore body which is long, to thick and reaching a depth of up to . Since mining began at the site in 1898, the mine has produced over 950 million tonnes of ore. In 2004, it was decided that the present centre of the city would need to be relocated to accommodate mining-related subsidence. The relocation would be made gradually over decades. On May 18, 2020 an earthquake of approximate 4.9 Mw was triggered in the footwall of the mine. The earthquake was not natural but induced by the mining activity. History Miners at work, circa 1940-1959 The Kiruna mineral deposit was formed following intense volcanic activity. Iron-rich solutions precipitated the iron on to a syenite porphyry footwall. Then the ore bed was covered by further volcanic deposits, quartz porphyry, and sedimentary rocks. Later the whole body was tilted to its current dip of 50 to 60°. The ore is predominately magnetite and disseminated interstitial apatite, with an average of 0.9% phosphorus. In 1902 the Kiruna Narvik Railway was completed, allowing the shipment of ore through the ice-free port of Narvik. In the beginning, surface mining was used, but the mine has been mined with the sublevel caving mining method since the 1960s. In 1985 reserves for the Kiruna Mine were 1,800 million tonnes grading 60–65% iron and 0.2% phosphorus. As of 2018 the Kiruna Mine had Proven and Probable Reserves of 683 million tonnes grading 43.8% iron. Until 1999 the deepest level of the mine reached , but after 1999 mining went deeper, reaching a depth of . The level could support iron ore production until 2018. On October 28, 2008 LKAB decided to go even deeper, with the mine reaching a depth of by 2012 at a cost of US$1.7 billion. Cross section of Kiruna iron ore mine  Moving the town  The re-development of Kiruna is a reconstruction project, as the Kirunavaara mine, run by LKAB, undermines the current town centre. The town centre is to be moved to the east. 21 of the most important buildings are to be moved. In 2004, it was decided that the city centre would need to be relocated to accommodate mining-related subsidence. The relocation would be made gradually over the coming decade. In January 2007 a new location was proposed, to the northwest at the foot of Luossavaara mountain, by Lake Luossajärvi. The first physical work moving the town commenced in November 2007, when work on the new main sewerage pipe started. In the same week, first sketches for the layout of the new part of the town became available. The sketches include a travel centre, the new locations for the city hall and the church, an artificial lake and an extension of the Luossavaara hill into the city.Skissförslag nov.-07 The location of the new section of the E10 is still uncertain, as is the location of the railway and the railway station. A more official sketch was published early in the spring of 2008, which was then discussed with various interest groups before a further version was to be produced. In June 2010 the city council decided that the town would be moved eastwards (to ), in the direction of Tuolluvaara, instead of the proposed northwestern location. The town move was started in 2014 in a process that will continue to 2040, with the centre- most part of the town re-established by 2022. White Arkitekter AB based in Stockholm and Ghilardi + Hellsten Arkitekter based in Oslo together with researchers from Luleå and Delft Universities won the contract to design the new city, which envisages a denser city centre with a greater focus on sustainability, green and blue infrastructure, pedestrians and public transport rather than automobiles.

It was previously known as the Falset subzone of Tarragona (DO), and was created as a separate DO in the early 2000s. Regional approval came in 2001, and from 2002 wines were sold as Montsant rather than Tarragona.DO Regulations, published in DOGC no. 4414 dated 28-6-2005. In Catalan Montsant takes its name from the Montsant mountains in the area. Under the auspices of the DOP Montsant, the region has seen rapid growth, starting with 28 official cellars in 2002 which grew to number 55 currently. Approximately 94% of the production is of red wine with 62% exportation outside Spain, 28% consumed in Catalonia, and 10% sold to the rest of Spain. Geography Montsant DOP almost completely surrounds the more famous Priorat (DOQ). The vineyards extend along the mountainsides among olive groves, forests and rocky outcrops. The denomination covers the area of Priorat comarca that is not part of DOQ Priorat as well as part of the neighboring comarca of Ribera d'Ebre. In total, 17 villages are included: La Bisbal de Falset, Cabacés, Capçanes, Cornudella de Montsant, La Figuera, els Guiamets, Marçà, Margalef, El Masroig, Pradell de la Teixeta, La Torre de Fontaubella, Ulldemolins, along with portions of Falset, Garcia, El Molar, Móra la Nova and Tivissa (the sub-villages of Darmós and La Serra d'Almos. Soils Vineyards range from 200 to 700 meters in altitude and sit on three main soil types: chalky clay, granitic sand, and slate. The altitude tends to increase towards the Serra de Montalt in the southwest and towards the Serra de Montsant in the northwest. There is a large degree of variation from the small, relatively flat plain around Falset and Marçà to the high altitude village of La Figuera that sits on a mountain range at 575 meters. Climate The climate is Mediterranean with continental influences. Summers are dry and annual rainfall is about 650 mm, falling mainly in autumn. There is only an occasional risk of hailstones or frost. Authorised Grape Varieties The authorised grape varieties are: * Red: Garnatxa Negra, Carinyena, Ull de llebre, Syrah, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon * White: Garnatxa Blanca, Macabeu / Viura, Chardonnay, Moscatell d’Alexandria, and Xarel·lo Wine styles Celler Cooperatiu de Cornudella.

At the same time Tecumseh's War started, the conflict in the Old Northwest between the U.S. and an Indian confederacy led by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh. He became an official ally of the British in 1812. William Henry Harrison's victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, coupled with the defeat and death of Tecumseh in 1813, broke the power of the Indians.

Michigan-Ohio War In 1835, the Michigan-Ohio War broke out over the disputed Toledo Strip. Ohio, led by Governor Robert Lucas, marched into the strip in the spring of 1835. Michigan Governor Stevens T. Mason responded by marching an army into Toledo, destroying agricultural operations and seizing a prisoner of war. Following intelligence reports to the Michigan army that a vast army of Ohio sharpshooters had gathered to engage them, half of Mason's troops deserted and the rest withdrew.

Scott of Massillon, and James Richard Ward of Springfield, the United States declared war on the Axis Powers. 839,000 Ohioans would serve in the conflict, with 23,000 casualties or MIAs. As recently as September 2010, Ohio MIAs from the war were still being found and returned to Ohio, such as Michael Chiodo, who was killed flying bombing raids over Germany.Remains of missing World War II airman from Cleveland return to Northeast Ohio for burial In total, the state would produce 27 Medal of Honor recipients from the war, including Harry Linn Martin, William Edward Metzger, Patrick L. Kessler, Emile Deleau, Joseph Cicchetti, Sylvester Antolak, Frank Joseph Petrarca, and Robert Craig. Ohio played a key industrial role in the war effort, with factories mobilized to produce armaments and supplies. Tens of thousands of Americans flocked to the state seeking employment in the defense industries, including many from Appalachia.World War II =Foreign POWs= Nearly 8,000 German and Italian prisoners of war were housed in Ohio, mostly located at Bowling Green, Ohio, Defiance and Celina.German and Italian World War II Prisoners of War =Opposition= Prior to the outbreak, the German-American Bund had been active in the state promoting support for the Third Reich.

Since its development in the 1790s, Gay Street has served as the city's principal financial and commercial thoroughfare, and has played a primary role in the city's historical and cultural development. The street contains Knoxville's largest office buildings and oldest commercial structures. Several buildings on Gay Street have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Part of Charles McClung's original 1791 plat of Knoxville, Gay Street was a focal point for the early political activity of both the city as well as the State of Tennessee. By 1850, Gay Street was home to three-fourths of Knoxville's commercial activity, and in 1854, the street became Knoxville's first paved road.East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 20, 31, 42, 75, 88, 130-132, 216-218, 230, 299, 307, 463-465, 636.

After the war, Gay Street saw extensive commercial development as railroad construction brought an industrial boom to Knoxville. Gay Street and events that took place on Gay Street have been mentioned in the works of James Agee, Cormac McCarthy, Mark Twain, and George Washington Harris. Cultural institutions established along Gay Street include the Lawson McGhee Library (1886), the Bijou Theatre (1909), the Riviera Theatre (1920), the Tennessee Theatre (1928), and the East Tennessee History Center (2004). The Knoxville Journal, Knoxville Whig, and Knoxville Register were all once headquartered on Gay Street, and radio stations WNOX and WROL both broadcast from Gay Street at various times during the 20th century.

History =Early development= Gay Street was part of the original plat of Knoxville drawn up by surveyor Charles McClung in 1791. The street originally stretched from the river to what is now Church Avenue (Knoxville's original northern boundary). Within a few years, the boundary had been extended to Clinch Avenue, effectively adding what is now Gay Street's 600 block.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: The Society, 1972), pp. 46, 221-222, 411. The eastern half of this block was originally part of the land set aside by Knoxville founder James White for Blount College, the forerunner of the University of Tennessee. In its early years, Gay Street was known as \\"Market Street,\\" \\"Broad Street,\\" or \\"Court Street.\\" The name \\"Gay Street,\\" which was probably inspired by the Gay Street in Baltimore,Jack Neely, The Train Goes On.

Retrieved: 16 May 2011. The intersection of Gay and Main was the focal point of late 18th century Knoxville, with the courthouse initially located at its northwest corner and the jail located at its southeast corner. Knoxville's first store, established in 1792 by brothers Samuel and Nathaniel Cowan, was located on the northeast corner of this intersection, and the city's first major hotel the Lamar House (now part of the Bijou) was built on the southwest corner of Gay and Cumberland in 1817. On January 11, 1796, the first Tennessee state constitutional convention convened at the office of War Department agent Colonel David Henley, which was located at the corner of Gay and Church.Donald F. Paine, Capital Cities of Tennessee. Tennessee Bar Journal, March 2010. Retrieved: 28 September 2010. This early political and commercial activity on Gay Street helped the street develop into Knoxville's main thoroughfare, and by 1850, Gay Street was home to three- fourths of Knoxville's commercial activity. In 1851, the street's sidewalks were widened to . Three years later, Gay Street was macadamized and paved with cobblestones. Upon completion of the railroad in 1855, Gay Street was extended still further northward to what are now the Southern Railway tracks. =The Civil War= Sketch from Parson Brownlow's Book showing Confederate soldiers shooting Unionist Charles Douglas through the window of his Gay Street home in 1861 In the months leading up to the Civil War, prominent pro-Union and pro- Secession supporters spoke at Gay Street venues such as the Lamar House Hotel, while the Knoxville Whig and Knoxville Register, which were arguably the mouthpieces for East Tennessee Unionism and secessionism, respectively, were both headquartered on Gay Street. In April 1861, Union and Confederate supporters held simultaneous recruiting rallies at opposite ends of Gay Street. Future president Andrew Johnson spoke at the Union rally, and a shootout nearly erupted when several Confederate recruits attempted to interrupt his speech. Union forces under Ambrose Burnside occupied Knoxville in September 1863, and Burnside chose as his headquarters the home of John Hervey Crozier at the corner of Gay and Clinch streets (now the location of the Farragut Hotel). Union general William P. Sanders, who was wounded in a skirmish with Confederate troops on Kingston Pike in November 1863, died at the Lamar House Hotel, which had been converted into a hospital. =Commercial development= Gay Street's 300 block, circa 1903 After the Civil War, several major banks were established during Knoxville's post-Civil War commercial boom, including Mechanics' National Bank (1882) and Holston National Bank (1890),John Wooldridge, George Mellen, William Rule (ed.), Standard History of Knoxville, Tennessee (General Books, 2009), pp. 156-164, 233-238. both of which would eventually build headquarters that still stand on Gay Street. After the Great Depression, Hamilton National Bank (operating out of the Holston building) grew to become the dominant bank in East Tennessee. In the 1970s, this bank was seized by United American Bank president Jake Butcher, who built the Plaza and Riverview towers before being indicted for bank fraud in the 1980s.Bruce Wheeler, Knoxville, Tennessee: A Mountain City in the New South (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2005), pp. 56, 168. In the early 1830s, James Cowan (a nephew of Samuel and Nathaniel Cowan) and his brother-in-law, Perez Dickinson, opened a large general store at the corner of Gay and Main. During the 1850s, Cowan and Dickinson merged their interests with the McClung brothers (children of surveyor Charles McClung) to form the wholesaling giant, Cowan, McClung and Company. In the years following the Civil War, this company was the most profitable in Tennessee, and anchored Knoxville's powerful wholesaling sector.Nissa Dahlin Brown, National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Cowan, McClung and Company Building, May 1984. The company's four-story headquarters, erected on Gay Street's 500 block in 1871, was the cornerstone of what is now known as the Gay Street Commercial Historic District. Sterchi Brothers, founded in 1888, grew to become the world's largest furniture store chain by 1930,Ann Bennett and Pamela Dishongh, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Stratford (Sterchi Mansion), 23 March 2009. and built its 10-story headquarters at 114 South Gay in 1925. W. W. Woodruff and Company, founded in 1865, maintained a presence on Gay Street into the late 20th century. Gay Street was home to many of Knoxville's major department stores throughout the first half of the 20th century, most notably Miller's and S. H. George's. =Cultural development= The Riviera Theatre, constructed in 1920 and renovated in 2007 Throughout most of the 19th century, the Lamar House Hotel on Gay Street was the premier gathering place for Knoxville's upper class. During the 1870s and 1880s, the hotel's masquerade balls served oysters, imported wines, and cigars, and drew the likes of artist Lloyd Branson (whose studio was also located on Gay Street) and author Frances Hodgson Burnett.Jack Neely, Knoxville's Secret History (Scruffy Books, 1995), pp. 70-71. By the 1930s, the Farragut Hotel (1919) and the Andrew Johnson Hotel (1929) had become Knoxville's premier hotels.

Knoxville's first major performance venue, Staub's Theatre, was built on Gay Street's 800 block in 1872, and in its early years showcased acts ranging from Payson's English Opera Troupe to vaudeville acts and wrestling matches. The Bijou Theatre, constructed as an addition to the Lamar House Hotel in 1909, would witness performances by the likes of the Marx Brothers, Dizzy Gillespie, and the Ballets Russes. In 1928, the Tennessee Theatre eclipsed the Bijou as Knoxville's major performance venue, and served as the city's first-run movie house until the 1950s. Knoxville's two oldest radio stations, WNOX and WROL, broadcast from Gay Street during the 1920s and 1930s. WNOX featured Lowell Blanchard's Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round, initially broadcast from the Andrew Johnson Hotel, which helped launch the careers of performers such as Roy Acuff and Archie Campbell, and remained a popular noon-time radio show until the 1950s. WROL, which broadcast from the Central House Hotel (next to the Farragut), the Mechanics' Bank building, and later from a North Gay location, was best known in this period for its host, eccentric local businessman Cas Walker. =Structural improvements= The Saulpaw bridge, the predecessor of the current Gay Street Bridge, as it appeared on an 1886 map of Knoxville Knoxville's first permanent bridge over the Tennessee River was constructed at the south end of Gay Street in 1867, but stood for just a short time. In 1880, G. W. Saulpaw built what became known as the \\"Saulpaw bridge\\" at the site, which stood until it was replaced by the current Gay Street Bridge in 1898.Martha Carver, Tennessee's Survey Report for Historic Highway Bridges: Pre-1946 Masonry Arch, Timber Truss, Metal Truss, Concrete Arch, Metal Arch and Suspension Bridges (Nashville, Tenn.: Tennessee Department of Transportation, 2008), pp. 384–386. At the street's north end, an iron bridge was built across the Southern Railway tracks in 1876, easing pedestrian access between the north and south sides of the tracks. The first Gay Street Viaduct across the tracks was built in 1919, and the current viaduct was built in 2005.Rick Emmett, Gay Street 100 Block Construction Project . Retrieved: 28 September 2010. In 1876, the Knoxville Streetcar Company built the city's first trolley line along Gay Street. The trolleys, initially pulled by horses, were electrified by William Gibbs McAdoo in 1890. The Gay Street Bridge originally contained trolley tracks, which helped spark the development of South Knoxville, especially the Island Home Park and Vestal areas. Trolleys were a common site on Gay Street until the trolley lines were eliminated and the tracks were paved over in 1947 . =Decline and revitalization= The development of suburbs on the periphery of Knoxville in the 1950s led to the rise of suburban shopping centers, and Gay Street, which had long struggled with traffic congestion and lack of parking, began to decline as a major retail corridor. In 1955, Rich's (which had purchased S. H. George's) moved to a new location, and Miller's abandoned plans to build a new store on Gay Street's 800 block. In an attempt to revitalize the downtown area, several Knoxville businessmen formed the Downtown Knoxville Association in 1956. Following the DKA's suggestions, more parking space was created for Gay Street businesses and storefronts were renovated, but efforts to revitalize Gay Street as a major commercial corridor were largely unsuccessful. During the 1970s and 1980s, Gay Street transitioned from a retail corridor to an office market, symbolized by the erection of the Plaza and Riverview towers, and the renovation of the Andrew Johnson Hotel as an office building. During the same period, successful efforts to save the Bijou laid the foundation for the preservation group Knox Heritage, and more focus was placed on the preservation of Gay Street's historical integrity. More recently, a number of Gay Street high-rises, including the Holston, Sterchi Lofts, and the upper levels of the Burwell Building, have been successfully renovated as downtown condominium space.Josh Flory, \\"Downtown Condo Sells for $1M.\\" Knoxnews.com, 17 September 2008.

Service The 6th Maine Infantry was organized in Portland, Maine and mustered in for a three-year enlistment on July 15, 1861. The regiment was attached to W. F. Smith's Brigade, Division of the Potomac, to October 1861. 2nd Brigade, Smith's Division, Army of the Potomac, to March 1862. 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, IV Corps, Army of the Potomac, to May 1862. 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, VI Corps, to February 1863. Light Division, VI Corps, to May 1863. 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, VI Corps, to August 1864. The 6th Maine Infantry mustered out of service August 15, 1864. Veterans and recruits were transferred to the 7th Maine Infantry and soon consolidated to become the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry.  Detailed History  This regiment was composed principally of the hardy lumbermen of the Penobscot Valley and the eastern portion of the state, who were quick to respond to the first call to arms. Before its organization it was made up of two battalions of five companies each, rendezvousing respectively at the state arsenal, Bangor, and Fort Sullivan, Eastport. Under a general order from Adjt.-Gen. Hodsdon, June 28, 1861, both battalions were removed to Portland and organized into a regiment for active service. On July 12-15, 1861, it was mustered into the service of the United States and on the 17th left for Washington. En route through New York City, the regiment was presented with a handsome standard by the sons of Maine in that city. It arrived in Washington on the 19th and was stationed at Chain Bridge on the Potomac, where it remained until Sept. 3. Through the fall and winter of 1861-62 it occupied Fort Griffin, and in March, 1862, was put into Hancock's brigade, Smith's division, and joined in the advance on Manassas. A little later it was attached to the 4th Corps under Gen. E. D. Keyes, and advanced with the rest of the army on Yorktown on April 4, 1862. For the remainder of its three years the regiment saw the most arduous and active service. It participated in ten general engagements and in a great many skirmishes. On April 5-7, 1862, it was engaged in skirmishing and reconnaissances at the siege of Yorktown, and subsequently took part in the engagements at Lee's Mills, Williamsburg, Garnett's Farm, White Oak bridge, Antietam and Fredericksburg. From Feb. 2 to May 11, 1863, it was with the \\"Light Division\\", and during this period took an honorable part in the Battle of Chancellorsville, where it lost 128 officers and men killed and wounded. Other important battles in which the 6th was engaged were Rappahannock Station, where it lost 16 officers and 123 men; Wilderness, Spottsylvania Court House, where it lost a few men, and two days later in an attack on the enemy's works on the right, it lost 125 in killed, wounded and missing. On June 12, 1864, the regiment only numbered 70 men, and was under fire for eight hours, supporting Gen. Hancock's corps, losing 16 officers and men. The original members of the regiment were mustered out on Aug. 15, 1864, and the veterans and recruits to the number of 238 men, were transferred to the 7th Me. afterwards organized as the 1st Regiment Veteran Volunteers. Casualties The regiment lost a total of 255 men during service; 12 officers and 141 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, 2 officers and 100 enlisted men died of disease.

International Business Times, August 11, 2011 to provide accurate, live information and broadcasts. Coverage was extended to the surrounding areas such as West Bromwich and Wolverhampton the following night. The channel's coverage was used by BBC News, ITN and Sky News as well as international stations such as CNN, Fox News and NDTV 24x7 to show what was happening in the area. This coverage included sequences of guerrilla journalism, most notably footage of the reporting team transporting a police officer in their vehicle in pursuit of looters while live on air. The popularity of the coverage led to Sangat TV presenter Upinder Randhawa's Twitter following jumping from 600 users to about 4,000 users in one night, as well as having over 4,000 followers to a fan page on Facebook called \\"Upinder Randhawa from Sangat TV is a Legend\\". Prime Minister David Cameron hailed Sangat TV's contribution as \\"an example of a media company's commitment to social responsibility\\". On 10 August 2011, Ofcom said it had received one complaint about the previous night's coverage of the riots, in relation to alleged incitement to violence over comments urging people to get out on the streets and protect their property. Management issues  In August 2016, word went round that Sangat TV would be moving its base from Edgbaston, Birmingham to Southall, London in a bid to get better content and volunteers to run the channel. Ofcom / broadcasting issues Sangat TV was fined £30,000 over a debate in which guests supported an assassination attempt on a former Indian Army general, Kuldip Singh Brar, who led the army attack on Akal Takht in Operation Blue Star in June 1984. In 2015, the Ofcom Broadcasting Code was broken when Sangat TV continuously aired a song hailing 'Sukha Jinda', two criminals who had robbed a bank, with justification that it was an advert from Dharam Seva Records. The complainant considered that the video glorified the actions of two Sikh nationalists Harjinder Singh Jinda and Sukhdev Singh Sukha (\\"Jinda\\" and \\"Sukha\\" respectively). These men, who were members of the Khalistan Commando Force, were hanged in 1992 for the assassination of General Arun Shridhar Vadiya, the Chief of the Indian Army responsible for Operation Bluestar in 1984. They were also found responsible for the murder of two Indian politicians. Ofcom upheld a complaint made by Dr Parvinder Singh Garcha. The programme, which aired in September 2014 included a live debate in advance of an election for a new committee to run the Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Southall, West London. At the end of the debate two videos were shown. The second video also included the claim that money had been stolen from a donation box in the Gurdwara during a period when the Baaj Group was in control. Ofcom noted that the decision to include the second video was made by the presenter during the course of the programme and that Dr Garcha said that he had left the studio before at the end of the debate (i.e. before the video in question was shown). However, in Ofcom's view, it is reasonable to expect that before making such a decision, a broadcaster would be familiar with the content of any material it planned to broadcast. Ofcom considered that the Baaj Group was treated unfairly in this respect in the programme as broadcast.

Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, the second story in their Harold Shea series. It was first published in the August 1940 issue of the fantasy pulp magazine Unknown. It first appeared in book form, together with the preceding novella, \\"The Roaring Trumpet\\", in the collection The Incomplete Enchanter, issued in hardcover by Henry Holt and Company in 1941, and in paperback by Pyramid Books in 1960. It has since been reprinted in various collections by numerous other publishers, including The Compleat Enchanter (1975), The Incompleat Enchanter (1979), The Complete Compleat Enchanter (1989), and The Mathematics of Magic: The Enchanter Stories of L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt (2007). It has been translated into Dutch and Italian. In 2016, the story was shortlisted for the Retro Hugo Award for Best Novella. The Harold Shea stories are parallel world tales in which universes where magic works coexist with our own, and in which those based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world and can be reached by aligning one's mind to them by a system of symbolic logic. In \\"The Mathematics of Magic\\", Shea visits his second such world, that of Edmund Spenser's epic poem The Faerie Queene. Plot summary Psychologist Harold Shea's accidental visit to the world of Norse mythology has confirmed his colleague Reed Chalmer's speculation that alternate universes can be reached by employing a system of symbolic logic encoding their basic assumptions. Encouraged at his theory's validation but pessimistic as to the prospects of it being taken seriously by their profession, Chalmers proposes to join Shea in a second expedition, more carefully planned, to a world in which they can achieve the fame and fortune that they are unlikely to gain in their own. He suggests the world represented by Spenser's The Faerie Queene. Outfitting themselves appropriately, they make the attempt and are successful in reaching their target world. They soon encounter the Lady Britomart, one of Queen Gloriana's knights, in whose company they attend a tournament at the castle of Satyrane. At the feast afterward Chalmers becomes smitten by a magical simulacrum of the Lady Florimel, only to lose her in the confusion engendered by a sorcerous disruption of the proceedings. Later he and Shea undertake to find the root of the trouble, a secret brotherhood of enchanters they theorize has been tipping the balance against the forces of good, and which they hope to infiltrate and subvert. They meet the woodland huntress Belphebe, with whom Shea becomes enamored, and face the peril of the Blatant Beast, summoned up by Chalmers in a spell gone wrong. Finally, the two succeed in infiltrating the enchanters' cabal, Chalmers as a magician and Shea as his apprentice. Chalmers, bringing a systematic and scientific approach to bear on the study of magic, fits right in—a bit too well, in Shea's opinion. The secret society appears so congenial to Chalmers that Shea becomes concerned the subversion is going the other way. Escaping, he reveals the enchanters' lair to the realm's knights, who gather to assault it, aided from within by the magic of Chalmers, who was not as far gone as Shea had feared. In the aftermath, Shea and Belphebe are blasted back to the mundane world by the attack of a surviving magician, whereupon Belphebe finally accepts Shea's proposal of marriage. Relation to The Faerie Queene The plotline of the story departs from its source, Spenser's unfinished poem, as it is the avowed intention of the protagonists to resolve the situation therein. The perceived greater difficulties faced by Spenser's knights in the later portions of the poem are explained by the evil enchanters of the piece having secretly organized into a guild to more effectively oppose them. Shea and Chalmers are instrumental in revealing this conspiracy to the knights and assisting in its overthrow. Sources  External links * Fantasy short stories Short stories by L.

The bridge is located adjacent to the river mouth, where the Cooks River empties into Botany Bay. The bridge is maintained by Roads & Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales.  History  The Endeavour Bridge was opened to traffic in May 1951 as two, two-lane bridges. The road carries motor vehicles and a grade-separated pedestrian footpath. It was built due to the diversion of Cooks River required by the expansion of Kingsford-Smith Airport. The bridges were constructed before the water flow was diverted beneath them. In 1963 the two bridges were widened by extending their decks into the area between them, resulting in one six-lane bridge. This upgrade was undertaken in conjunction with the upgrade of General Holmes Drive from four to six lanes, which was the first upgrading of a 'county road' as part of the County of Cumberland Planning Scheme. Etymology The Endeavour Bridge takes its name from , the ship commanded by James Cook, an English explorer, navigator and cartographer. Lieutenant Cook and the crew of the Endeavour were the first recorded European expedition to navigate and map the eastern coastline of Australia. They arrived in nearby Botany Bay in 1770.

Life Karl Heinrich was born in Dresden into the distinguished noble family von Hoym, the youngest son of Baron Ludwig Gebhard von Hoym and brother of Count Adolph Magnus von Hoym, and was baptised on 19 June 1694 in the chapel of the Residenz at Dresden. He was born Freiherr (\\"Baron\\") von Hoym, and on 18 July 1711 together with his three brothersAdolph Magnus, Carl Siegfried and Ludwig Gerhard was raised to the rank of Count of the Empire (Reichsgraf). He set out on the Grand Tour in 1713 and eventually settled in Paris, where after 3 years he had developed his reputation sufficiently to be appointed Saxon envoy to the Court of Versailles in 1720 after the death of the previous ambassador, Burkhard von Suhm, at the suggestion of the First Minister of Saxony, Jacob Heinrich von Flemming. In 1725 he was raised to the rank of ambassador. While at Versailles he was close to the young Louis XV and his wife Maria Leszczyńska. He acquired a great knowledge of French culture and literature, and an extensive private library. He also succeeded, during the speculations of Law, in making himself a substantial fortune. Accordingly to his stand in society and wealth, Hoym arrayed his Parisian Hôtel with tapestries, Chinese and Saxon porcelain, bronze statues and, most importantly, paintings of great value by renown Old Masters. His impressive collection encompassed works by Guido Reni, Francesco Albani, Annibale Carracci, Peter Paul Rubens, Paul Brill, and Claude Lorrain, some of which were later acquired for the Royal-Electoral Painting Gallery ( nowadays Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister) in Dresden. In 1729, Hoym returned to Saxony, where Augustus the Strong had appointed him in the previous year cabinet minister of the Saxon Departement Domestique (Department of Internal Affairs), in which his responsibilities included the management of the porcelain works at Meissen. However, his Frenchified behaviour made him many powerful enemies. Moreover, as the champion of an alliance of Saxony with France and the sea powers against the Holy Roman Empire he attracted the hostile attention of the cabinets of Berlin and Vienna, abetted by the ambitious chamberlain Heinrich von Brühl. In addition, his connections to the French court and the queen's father, Stanislas Leszczyński, a claimant to the Polish throne, put him hopelessly in opposition to the ambitions of the Electors of Saxony regarding Poland. Karl Heinrich's many enemies both domestic and external brought him several times into disfavour at court. In 1731 he was imprisoned on a variety of charges, including disloyalty, but in the absence of any evidence, was released again. In 1734, however, another, apparently trumped-up, charge was brought against him, namely, of impregnating his own niece, the wife of Heinrich von Bünau. Again he was released, this time thanks to the intervention of Prince Alexander Jakub Lubomirski, but in 1736, against the background of the War of the Polish Succession, he was arrested a third time on a charge of treason. He was found guilty, his estates were confiscated and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Among his confiscated possessions was one of the few known surviving copies of the Theophrastus redivivus, a 17th-century anti-religious text, which was then given to the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, where it remains today. However, the book was apparently first bought by Claude Sallier, who then donated it to the national library in 1741; however, his name does not appear on the list of individuals who bought the book in the initial August 1738 auction of von Hoym's belongings, throwing a shadow of doubt as to if von Hoym actually owned the copy or whether it was donated in his name to discredit him. He committed suicide in his cell in Königstein Fortress (Festung Königstein) on 22 April 1736.

It typically refers to visible electromagnetic radiation from stars other than the Sun, observable from Earth at night, although a component of starlight is observable from Earth during daytime. Sunlight is the term used for the Sun's starlight observed during daytime. During nighttime, albedo describes solar reflections from other Solar System objects, including moonlight, planetshine, and zodiacal light. Observation Observation and measurement of starlight through telescopes is the basis for many fields of astronomy, including photometry and stellar spectroscopy. Hipparchus did not have a telescope or any instrument that could measure apparent brightness accurately, so he simply made estimates with his eyes. He sorted the stars into six brightness categories, which he called magnitudes.Astronomy. https://d3bxy9euw4e147.cloudfront.net/oscms- prodcms/media/documents/Astronomy-Draft-20160817.pdf: Rice University. 2016. p. 761. - via Open Stax. He referred to the brightest stars in his catalog as first-magnitudes stars, which were the brightest stars and those so faint he could barely see them were sixth-magnitude stars. Starlight is also a notable part of personal experience and human culture, impacting a diverse range of pursuits including poetry, Wells Hawks Skinner – Studies in literature and composition for high schools, normal schools, and ... (1897) – Page 102 (Google eBook link) astronomy, and military strategy.Popular Mechanics – Jan 1969 – \\"How the Army Learned to See in the Dark\\" by Mort Schultz (Google Books link) The United States Army spent millions of dollars in the 1950s and onward to develop a starlight scope, that could amplify starlight, moonlight filtered by clouds, and the fluorescence of rotting vegetation about 50,000 times to allow a person to see in the night. In contrast to previously developed active infrared system such as sniperscope, it was a passive device and did not require additional light emission to see. The average color of starlight in the observable universe is a shade of yellowish-white that has been given the name Cosmic Latte. Starlight spectroscopy, examination of the stellar spectra, was pioneered by Joseph Fraunhofer in 1814. Starlight can be understood to be composed of three main spectra types, continuous spectrum, emission spectrum, and absorption spectrum. Starlight illuminance coincides with the human eye's minimum illuminance (~0.1 mlx) while moonlight coincides with the human eye's minimum colour vision illuminance (~50 mlx). IEE Reviews, 1972, page 1183 Oldest starlight One of the oldest stars yet identified ⁠— oldest but not most distant in this case ⁠— was identified in 2014: while \\"only\\" 6,000 light years away, the star SMSS J031300.36−670839.3 was determined to be 13.8 billion years old, or more or less the same age as the universe itself. The starlight shining on Earth would include this star. Photography Night photography includes photographing subjects that are lit primarily by starlight. Directly taking images of night sky is also a part of astrophotography. Like other photography, it can be used for the pursuit of science and/or leisure. Subjects include nocturnal animals. In many cases starlight photography may also overlap with a need to understand the impact of moonlight. Polarization Startlight intensity has been observed to be a function of its polarization. Starlight becomes partially linearly polarized by scattering from elongated interstellar dust grains whose long axes tend to be oriented perpendicular to the galactic magnetic field. According to the Davis–Greenstein mechanism, the grains spin rapidly with their rotation axis along the magnetic field. Light polarized along the direction of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight is transmitted, while light polarized in the plane defined by the rotating grain is blocked. Thus the polarization direction can be used to map the galactic magnetic field. The degree of polarization is on the order of 1.5% for stars at 1,000 parsecs' distance. Normally, a much smaller fraction of circular polarization is found in starlight. Serkowski, Mathewson and Ford measured the polarization of 180 stars in UBVR filters. They found a maximum fractional circular polarization of q = 6 \\\\times 10^{-4}, in the R filter. The explanation is that the interstellar medium is optically thin. Starlight traveling through a kiloparsec column undergoes about a magnitude of extinction, so that the optical depth ~ 1. An optical depth of 1 corresponds to a mean free path, which is the distance, on average that a photon travels before scattering from a dust grain. So on average, a starlight photon is scattered from a single interstellar grain; multiple scattering (which produces circular polarization) is much less likely. Observationally, the linear polarization fraction p ~ 0.015 from a single scattering; circular polarization from multiple scattering goes as p^{2}, so we expect a circularly polarized fraction of q \\\\sim 2 \\\\times 10^{-4}. Light from early-type stars has very little intrinsic polarization. Kemp et al. measured the optical polarization of the Sun at sensitivity of 3 \\\\times 10^{-7}; they found upper limits of 10^{-6} for both p (fraction of linear polarization) and q (fraction of circular polarization). The interstellar medium can produce circularly polarized (CP) light from unpolarized light by sequential scattering from elongated interstellar grains aligned in different directions. One possibility is twisted grain alignment along the line of sight due to variation in the galactic magnetic field; another is the line of sight passes through multiple clouds. For these mechanisms the maximum expected CP fraction is q \\\\sim p^{2}, where p is the fraction of linearly polarized (LP) light. Kemp & Wolstencroft found CP in six early-type stars (no intrinsic polarization), which they were able to attribute to the first mechanism mentioned above. In all cases, q \\\\sim 10^{-4} in blue light. Martin showed that the interstellar medium can convert LP light to CP by scattering from partially aligned interstellar grains having a complex index of refraction. This effect was observed for light from the Crab Nebula by Martin, Illing and Angel. An optically thick circumstellar environment can potentially produce much larger CP than the interstellar medium. Martin suggested that LP light can become CP near a star by multiple scattering in an optically thick asymmetric circumstellar dust cloud. This mechanism was invoked by Bastien, Robert and Nadeau, to explain the CP measured in 6 T-Tauri stars at a wavelength of 768 nm. They found a maximum CP of q \\\\sim 7 \\\\times 10^{-4}. Serkowski measured CP of q = 7 \\\\times 10^{-3} for the red supergiant NML Cygni and q = 2 \\\\times 10^{-3} in the long-period variable M star VY Canis Majoris in the H band, ascribing the CP to multiple scattering in circumstellar envelopes. Chrysostomou et al. found CP with q of up to 0.17 in the Orion OMC-1 star-forming region, and explained it by reflection of starlight from aligned oblate grains in the dusty nebula. Circular polarization of zodiacal light and Milky Way diffuse galactic light was measured at wavelength of 550 nm by Wolstencroft and Kemp. They found values of q \\\\sim 5 \\\\times 10^{-3}, which is higher than for ordinary stars, presumably because of multiple scattering from dust grains.

The arrows are wind vectors and the grey shading indicates an equivalent potential temperature surface that highlights the surface inflow layer and eyewall region. Geophysical fluid dynamics, in its broadest meaning, refers to the fluid dynamics of naturally occurring flows, such as lava flows, oceans, and planetary atmospheres, on Earth and other planets. Two physical features that are common to many of the phenomena studied in geophysical fluid dynamics are rotation of the fluid due to the planetary rotation and stratification (layering). The applications of geophysical fluid dynamics do not generally include the circulation of the mantle, which is the subject of geodynamics, or fluid phenomena in the magnetosphere.  Fundamentals  To describe the flow of geophysical fluids, equations are needed for conservation of momentum (or Newton's second law) and conservation of energy. The former leads to the Navier–Stokes equations. Further approximations are generally made. First, the fluid is assumed to be incompressible. Remarkably, this works well even for a highly compressible fluid like air as long as sound and shock waves can be ignored. Second, the fluid is assumed to be a Newtonian fluid, meaning that there is a linear relation between the shear stress and the strain , for example : \\\\tau = \\\\mu \\\\frac{d u}{d x}, where is the viscosity. Under these assumptions the Navier-Stokes equations are : \\\\overbrace{\\\\rho \\\\Big( \\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\partial t}}_{ \\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Eulerian}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{acceleration} \\\\end{smallmatrix}} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot abla \\\\mathbf{v}}_{ \\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Advection} \\\\end{smallmatrix}}\\\\Big)}^{\\\\text{Inertia (per volume)}} = \\\\overbrace{\\\\underbrace{- abla p}_{ \\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Pressure} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{gradient} \\\\end{smallmatrix}} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\mu abla^2 \\\\mathbf{v}}_{\\\\text{Viscosity}}}^{\\\\text{Divergence of stress}} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbf{f}}_{ \\\\begin{smallmatrix} \\\\text{Other} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{body} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{forces} \\\\end{smallmatrix}}. The left hand side represents the acceleration that a small parcel of fluid would experience in a reference frame that moved with the parcel (a Lagrangian frame of reference). In a stationary (Eulerian) frame of reference, this acceleration is divided into the local rate of change of velocity and advection, a measure of the rate of flow in or out of a small region. The equation for energy conservation is essentially an equation for heat flow. If heat is transported by conduction, the heat flow is governed by a diffusion equation. If there are also buoyancy effects, for example hot air rising, then natural convection, also known as free convection, can occur. Convection in the Earth's outer core drives the geodynamo that is the source of the Earth's magnetic field. In the ocean, convection can be thermal (driven by heat), haline (where the buoyancy is due to differences in salinity), or thermohaline, a combination of the two.  Buoyancy and stratification  Internal waves in the Strait of Messina (photographed by ASTER). Fluid that is less dense than its surroundings tends to rise until it has the same density as its surroundings. If there is not much energy input to the system, it will tend to become stratified. On a large scale, Earth's atmosphere is divided into a series of layers. Going upwards from the ground, these are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. The density of air is mainly determined by temperature and water vapor content, the density of sea water by temperature and salinity, and the density of lake water by temperature. Where stratification occurs, there may be thin layers in which temperature or some other property changes more rapidly with height or depth than the surrounding fluid. Depending on the main sources of buoyancy, this layer may be called a pycnocline (density), thermocline (temperature), halocline (salinity), or chemocline (chemistry, including oxygenation). The same buoyancy that gives rise to stratification also drives gravity waves. If the gravity waves occur within the fluid, they are called internal waves. In modeling buoyancy-driven flows, the Navier-Stokes equations are modified using the Boussinesq approximation. This ignores variations in density except where they are multiplied by the gravitational acceleration . If the pressure depends only on density and vice versa, the fluid dynamics are called barotropic. In the atmosphere, this corresponds to a lack of fronts, as in the tropics. If there are fronts, the flow is baroclinic, and instabilities such as cyclones can occur.

Early in his political career, Munisteri served as state chairman of the Texas Chapter of Young Americans for Freedom and founded the Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT) in 1980. Munisteri stepped down as party chairman to join U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky as a senior advisor to Paul's 2016 presidential campaign. Background Munisteri was reared in Houston, where his father, Joseph G. Munisteri was an officer of Brown and Root, later president of Enserch Engineers and Construction, Comstock International, and the Texas division of Ford, Bacon & Davis. His mother, Theresa Grasso Munisteri was first a homemaker, and later worked at Rice University in Houston. After her retirement she continues to edit on a contract basis. Munisteri has three brothers and two sisters. He graduated from Memorial High School in the Hedwig Village section of Houston, where he was in the National Honor Society and the debate team. He received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University of Texas at Austin and a Doctor of Jurisprudence from the UT Law School, completing both degrees in five, instead of seven, years. With his law degree in hand, Munisteri returned to Houston and worked at the law offices of Funderburk and Funderburk (now Funderburk Funderburk Courtois, L.L.P.) for fourteen months before deciding to open his solo law practice, which he continued in partnership with others, for twenty-seven years. Munisteri founded the firm on November 1, 1982, the day before the defeat of Bill Clements as the first Republican governor of Texas since 1873. The firm is now known as Sprott, Rigby, Newson, Robbins & Lunceford, P.C. In addition to his legal practice, Munisteri was also involved in numerous other businesses in his professional career. He founded Munisteri Properties, a company with interests in commercial properties and whose primary asset was a Greenway Plaza-area building built in 1961 by Gerald D. Hines, which Munisteri redeveloped in 1993. Munisteri sold the Greenway Plaza Area building in 2007. However he still owns an interest in two shopping centers and a commercial building, as well as residential property. He also founded Munisteri Exploration in 1989, and has participated as a partner in the drilling of 60 oil and natural gas wells through 2014. As a side business, Munisteri managed dozens of professional boxers from 1989 to 2009, when he fully retired from the business. Numerous of his fighters obtained boxing titles and two fought for world championships. Munisteri freelanced as a play- by-play announcer and color commentator for independently produced televised boxing matches from 1995 to 2009. He was also a Court TV legal contributor and on-air personality from 1995 to 2001. Munisteri is divorced from the former Deanna Armstrong, whom he met through the University of Texas during the unsuccessful 1976 Ronald Reagan presidential campaign. They rode together on a bus from Austin to Kansas City, Missouri, to attend the Republican National Convention at the Kemper Arena, which nominated U.S. President Gerald R. Ford Jr., and then U.S. Senator Robert J. Dole of Kansas for vice president. Munisteri is a Presbyterian. The couple had no children. Early political involvement Munisteri was active in politics early in his teenage years, first working as a volunteer for the campaigns of Texas Republicans Hank Grover and John Tower in 1972, though the two were bitter intraparty rivals. Munisteri then formed a conservative club at Memorial High School in Houston. In 1976, he was elected State Vice Chairman for Texas Young Americans for Freedom, was an active volunteer for Ronald Reagan and attended the Republican National Convention. From 1977 to 1980, he served as State Chairman for YAF and was also elected to YAF's national board of directors. In 1977, Texas YAF was named the most improved state organization at its 1977 national convention. Under Munisteri's chairmanship, YAF began the practice of issuing legislative rankings for members of the Texas House of Representatives. In 1980, after experiencing dissatisfaction with the top-down leadership of the national YAF organization at its February 1980 convention, Munisteri proposed a new Texas-based conservative organization to the Texas YAF board. The board voted unanimously to create a new organization named Young Conservatives of Texas. The organization was founded on Texas Independence Day, March 2, 1980 at the Driskill Hotel in Austin, Texas. Munisteri served as the first state Chairman. Munisteri served as State Chairman of Young Texans for Reagan in 1980 under Reagan Texas Chair Ernie Angelo. He continued his Republican Party (GOP) activism as a precinct chairman of precincts 213 and 133 in Harris County in the 1980s, and was also elected to the State Republican Executive Committee for Senate District 17. Munisteri has worked in over 50 campaigns in a volunteer capacity. In 1995, he worked for the Lamar Alexander presidential campaign and helped to put together the Texas volunteer organization under Alexander's state chair Robert Mosbacher Jr. He also traveled to New Hampshire, Iowa, Florida and South Carolina on behalf of the Alexander campaign in 1996. In 1999, Munisteri spent a month in Iowa to assist the George W. Bush presidential campaign in the Iowa straw poll, and then spent a month in California running a Bush campaign office in San Fernando. In 2004, Munisteri was part of the Bush legal response team in Ohio during that year's presidential race. In 2008, he traveled to Iowa to assist Texas Land Commissioner Jerry E. Patterson in supporting Fred Thompson for President. That same year, Munisteri went on to South Carolina to volunteer on behalf of Thompson, and then later spent two months in Iowa assisting John McCain Iowa director Charlie Liebschutz. Texas GOP chairman =2009-2011= Munisteri speaking to the Tarrant County Republican Party's Lincoln Day Dinner. In September 2009, Texas GOP State Chairman Tina Benkiser announced her resignation at the quarterly State Republican Executive Committee meeting in Austin. Under Texas law, each major party must at all times have a woman as either its chairman or vice-chairman. Since Vice-Chairman Robin Armstrong did not relinquish his position to seek to succeed Benkiser as State Chairman, only a woman could be elected to fill the position. On October 24, 2009, the SREC elected Texas GOP National Committeewoman Cathie Adams as Benkiser's successor by a vote of 36-25. On January 22, 2010, Munisteri announced his candidacy for State Chairman citing a desire to make the RPT a \\"more effective organization\\" by utilizing his \\"strong business administrative skills\\". He was the second declared challenger in the race, as former SREC member Tom Mechler of Amarillo, had announced his candidacy the previous summer. Munisteri’s election marked the first time in modern history that a challenger defeated a sitting incumbent at the state convention. When Munisteri stepped down early in 2015, Mechler was elected his successor on the third secret ballot by the 62-member Republican State Executive Committee. During the campaign for state chairman, Munisteri cited the need to reduce recurring party debt which had reached over $700,000, and used that as a factor in defeating Adams, the incumbent. Adams claimed that party finances were in order, but reports upholding her contention were not released to the Federal Elections Commission or the Texas Ethics Commission. Munisteri brought a large number of youthful supporters to the convention and overwhelmed Adams' effort to win a full two- year term as chairman. Many of these young people were members of Young Conservatives of Texas, a conservative youth organization which Munisteri founded in 1980. On the second day of the convention, delegates voted by senatorial district for the position of State Chairman. Munisteri won 13 districts, Adams won 12 districts, and Mechler won 6 districts. Since no candidate received a majority of districts, a vote was held in the nominations committee of the convention, and Munisteri won the second ballot by a count of 22-9. After the nominations committee presented their results to the full convention, Adams then proceeded to force an unprecedented floor vote for the position, at which point Tom Mechler officially endorsed Munisteri's candidacy. Munisteri then addressed the full convention and declared that his differences with Adams are \\"insignificant to the duty we have to our country.\\" He placed the reelection of Perry as top priority and then the regaining of Republican majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. He added, \\"there's no question we have to get rid of that man in the White House,\\" a reference to U.S. President Barack Obama. In the ensuing floor vote, Munisteri prevailed with a margin of 4,170 to 2,950 for Adams. Ed Hubbard, a Harris County delegate who supported Munisteri over Adams, said that the GOP must be a \\"functioning statewide political organization focused on winning elections... to keep Texas in the Republican column, and keep its policies conservative.\\" Hubbard offered three reasons for his support of Munisteri: # Munisteri, he said, has \\"honestly confronted the actual present condition of the party organization, and has provided a plan to address it and improve it.\\" # He has pledged to \\"use his private-sector experiences to address the challenges facing the party organization.\\" # He \\"understands the need for unity within the party by conducting this campaign in a positive manner [and] has remained focused on what needs to be done to improve the effectiveness of the party, even while he has been attacked personally.\\" Hubbard did not say what personal attacks had been involved. Upon becoming chairman, Munisteri immediately focused his sights on the pending reelection campaign of Governor Rick Perry, who won a third full four-year term in the general election on November 2, 2010. Perry also served the last two years of the unexpired term of former Governor and U.S. President George W. Bush. He defeated the 2010 challenge of the Democrat William Henry \\"Bill\\" White, a businessman, former state party chairman, and a former mayor of Houston. Munisteri has issued a monthly \\"Chairman's Update\\" email to Texas Republicans with information regarding his activities as chairman. In December 2010, Munisteri announced that the RPT had fully retired its crippling debt and would end 2010 with zero debt, all bills paid, a record net worth, and a record positive cash balance in its accounts. Under Munisteri's chairmanship in the 2010 General Election, the Republican Party of Texas had a net gain of 324 Republican elected offices, obtained a super majority in the Texas House of Representatives, and won all statewide races on the ballot. In December 2011, Munisteri announced that for the first time in a decade, the state party had successfully recruited Republican county chairmen for the 2012 election cycle in all 254 Texas counties. In 2012, Munisteri served as a Presidential Elector for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.https://www.archives.gov/federal- register/electoral-college/2012-certificates/pdfs/ascertainment-texas.pdf =2012-2013= Munisteri was reelected as State Chairman in June 2012. Out of the over 9,000 delegates registered at the time of the 2012 convention vote only one voted against him. The party has continued to be debt free since December 2010 and has now adopted a policy to pay down all invoices to $0 by the end of each calendar month. The Party has also maintained cash reserves of at least $500,000 since November 2010. During the first three years of Munisteri’s Chairmanship the Party has brought in approximately $13.5 million including approximately $6.7 million in 2012 alone.Official Steve Munisteri Bio - TexasGOP.org The party’s improved financial condition allowed the RPT to be a major player in the 2010 and 2012 elections. This included, among other things, organizing three weekends of statewide block walk operations. This resulted in the Republican Party candidates winning 500 more offices in 2010 compared to 2008. Moreover, 75 additional office holders switched parties in 2010 for a net gain of 575 between the 2008 and 2010 election cycles. In 2012, the state party exclusively ran the Victory operations for the first time in years, resulting in the party making 2.6 million calls and sending out over 3 million pieces of mail. The state party spent a total of $2.2 million on its election efforts in 2012. Today there are currently 853 more Republicans in elected office than at the end of the elections in 2008.2012 Election Recap - TexasGOP.org Since his election, Chairman Munisteri has added a full-time Youth Director, Outreach Director, and Political Director. The party has also initiated an aggressive outreach program to the Hispanic, African American, and Asian American communities which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of minority delegates to the state convention, a significant increase in the number of minority members of the SREC, and an increase in the number of minority Republican elected officials statewide. In 2012 the number of Hispanic Republican elected officials statewide increased from 58 to 78.In June 2013, Chairman Munisteri announced a partnership with the RNC to establish Victory Centers that will operate on a year-round basis and that the Party would be hiring significant number of new field staff for these offices, including staffers assigned specifically to outreach to the Hispanic, African American, and Asian American communities. =2014= At the March 2014 meeting of the State Republican Executive Committee, Chairman Munisteri announced that he would seek re-election at the request of the successful Republican gubernatorial nominee Gregg Abbott. Munisteri also reported at that meeting the party had brought in approximately $17 million in revenues during his tenure as Chairman. He indicated that the Party was in excellent financial health and has been completely debt free since November 2010. He also indicated that cash reserves had never fallen below $500,000 during that time. Munisteri also reported at that meeting that the outreach and Victory efforts continued to be expanded to include 10 full-time engagement and field staffers, include a full-time Director of Youth Engagement, Director of African American Engagement, Director of Hispanic Engagement, and a full-time Director of Asian American Engagament. The Chairman reported on the great success of the Victory efforts. Specifically, he noted that the new statewide Asian American, African America, and Hispanic engagement organizations had been very active and attending numerous events around the state signing up hundreds of new contacts. Most encouraging, he also reported the engagement efforts has yielded verifiable results in the form of a February 2014 Gallup study that concluded that the Texas Republican Party had obtained 6% more support from the Hispanic community than the Republican Parties in all other 49 states. Moreover, the study indicated that Democrat support among Hispanics in Texas declined 7% over last few years. The Chairman also reported that the RPT has opened permanent Victory centers in Fort Worth, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Corpus Christi, El Paso, and The Valley. These centers have overseen numerous block walks utilizing thousands of volunteers knocking on tens of thousands of doors. In 2014, Chairman Munisteri was also an active member of the RNC's Commission on Convention Planning which presented its final report to the RNC in Memphis during the second week of May. Munisteri was also a member of the Rules Committee for the RNC and was appointed to a subcommittee that dealt with the Presidential Primary Process. He was an active supporter of reforming the process which included wrestling control of the debate process away from the media and giving it to the RNC. Munisteri also supported efforts to ensure that other states do not jump in front of Texas's March 1 primary date so Texas can be a major player in the 2016 presidential primary process. At the 2014 State Convention, Munisteri was re- elected as Chairman with only four votes against him out of approximately 7,000 delegates and alternates in attendance. In November, Munisteri announced that the party had set a new record for the number of Republicans elected to office around the state. As of December 4, 2014 Republicans held 3,652 elected offices around the state. This represented an increase of 360. When Munisteri was elected to office, Republicans held 2,470 offices.

At the final quarterly meeting of the SREC, Munisteri announced that he had secured funding to maintain permanent Victory centers and staff across the state. This was the first time in the history of the party that Victory operations did not cease at the conclusion of an election cycle. Munisteri resigned as chairman in March 2015 to act as Senior Adviser for Rand Paul for President. The Republican Executive Committee chose Tom Mechler (born c. 1957) of Amarillo as the new chairman. He defeated an intraparty challenge from Jared Woodfill, the former Harris County chairman. = 2015-present = In 2015, Munisteri announced he would be joining Senator Rand Paul's team of senior advisors. According to the Republican Party of Texas his resignation is effective March 7, 2015. In an official statement explaining his reasoning behind the decision Munisteri writes: > Today I informed the SREC that I will be stepping down on March 7th. I have > done so, in part, in order to accept the position of Senior Advisor to > Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Senator Paul shares my vision of promoting > the conservative values of individual freedom, limited government, a strong > national defense, and defense of the Constitution in each and every > community in our country. Steve Munisteri in Galveston, Texas on September 7, 2019. Munisteri said he's supporting Paul, in part because of the Kentucky Republican's strategy to court nontraditional GOP voters, like African-Americans and young people. On March 7, 2015, Munisteri presided over his last meeting of the SREC and provided a final report as to the condition of the party during his term. He also provided a more detailed report in writing to supporters of the party. He reported that he was turning over the chairmanship with $959,514 cash on hand plus $148,175 in pledges coming in.

This crowd includes workers, spivs and young police constables. A British entry into the teenage/youth house party genre typified by John Hughes' films and the late 1980s movies of Kid and Play. The movie was directed by Terry Winsor and written by Daniel Peacock and Winsor. It is notable for its soundtrack and as the early work of several of the cast members. Plot It's New Year's Eve, Johnny Reeve (Karl Howman) and his friend, Toby (Daniel Peacock) are out cruising in North-West London being followed by three quasi-threatening motorcyclists. At the same time, Larry (Perry Fenwick) is at Mass with his parents. Just after \\"Mum\\" and the Vicar begin bemoaning the nuisance that the motorcyclists make, Johnny and Toby pick up Larry from the front of the church. Through their conversation and those of other characters, we learn that the three are planning to hold a party at Larry's while his parents are away. Meanwhile, at the police station's gymnasium, Rebecca (Phoebe Nicholls) is sparring with Sam, physically and verbally. After the workout, in the locker room, she teases Sam and Terry. Out in the squad bay, the sergeant tells them they are not to break up any of the local parties which means they can all go to Larry's party. Larry fakes illness so that he doesn't have to go with his parents. Toby shows up early and almost blows it by talking about the party in front of Mum and Dad. Once the parents leave, Larry and Toby begin preparing for the guests. The rest of the movie takes place at the party. Larry is shocked to see Sharon engaged to Tony and keeps trying to spirit her away for a \\"last fling.\\" Rebecca and Johnny keep using others to get a reaction out of each other including Sam and Bobby. Toby unsuccessfully tries to connect with any female. Shirley is so distraught by her failed attempts to connect with any guy, she plans on drowning herself in the bath tub. Sonya tries to get Tony back. Brenda pursues Sam to no avail until it's clear that Rebecca really doesn't fancy him. Terry succeeds in getting blotto, or \\"paralytic.\\" Leading up to the climax, Terry and Shirley hit it off in a full bathtub and Bobby calls Brenda a slag. When Toby defends her honour, Bobby starts to get ready to beat Toby up. Johnny clears everyone out of the kitchen and locks the door leaving Toby alone with Bobby. While Sam and other men cowardly leave Toby in the lurch, Johnny circles back through the back door and sucker punches Bobby, knocking him out. With a wink to Toby, he leaves through the back door. Toby realizes his opportunity after a moment and stages a brawl with appropriate sound effects so that when the others burst in, he is holding his hand and giving the impression that he knocked Bobby out. Now the hero for standing up for her honour, Toby finds himself the object of Brenda's affection. Johnny and Rebecca connect. Shirley and Terry connect. Larry almost connects with Sharon when he is interrupted by Tony and Sonya. Hypocritically, Tony then breaks his engagement with Sharon and goes back to Sonya. The obligatory \\"discovery-by- parents\\" scene ends with a singing of Auld Lang Syne by the Chas and Dave as the cast dances in a New Year's circle.

He played parts of three National Hockey League (NHL) seasons with the Philadelphia Flyers. He is the younger brother of Kyle Wellwood. Playing career Wellwood was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the sixth round (172nd overall) of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Flyers on March 4, 2010, after playing four seasons of junior hockey with the Windsor Spitfires, with whom he helped win two straight Memorial Cup championships in 2009 and 2010. Wellwood was called up from the Adirondack Phantoms on November 1, 2010, in the wake of Flyers forward Danny Briere's three-game suspension and made his NHL debut against the Carolina Hurricanes on a line with James van Riemsdyk and Mike Richards. Wellwood recorded his first NHL point on November 6 against the New York Islanders, assisting on Andreas Nodl's game-winning goal at 14:35 of the third period. During the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Flyers called up Wellwood and a few other players, but he did not dress for a game. Wellwood scored his first NHL goal February 18, 2012, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, an unassisted goal against Marc-Andre Fleury. On April 7, 2013 during an AHL game, Wellwood was injured after his left skate accidentally cut the back of his right leg after falling awkwardly into the boards. His achilles tendon was 70 percent severed and three additional tendons were completely severed. Wellwood was expected to miss nine months. After missing the entire 2013–14 season, Wellwood retired and was hired as an assistant coach by the Oshawa Generals. Coaching career On May 20, 2016, Wellwood was named assistant coach for the Flint Firebirds of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). On October 18, 2018, Wellwood was named head coach of the Firebirds.

It was built in 1722–7, but the steeple dates from 1839. It is a Grade I Listed building. Holy Trinity is in the evangelical/low church tradition of the Church of England. History and architecture A 1714 proposal that a new church should be erected in central Leeds foundered for lack of subscribers, but, in 1722, Lady Elizabeth Hastings of Ledston, backed by leading merchants, revived the project, and the foundation stone of Holy Trinity was laid on 27 August 1722. The architect of the church was for some time believed to be William Halfpenny. However, it has subsequently been discovered that his designs for the church, for which he was paid £1 11s 6d on 8 May 1723, were never executed, and that the architect was William Etty of York. A letter from William Cookson to Ralph Thoresby dated 15 May 1723, enclosed \\"a draught , the south front of our new church\\"; it was drawn by Mr. Etty of York, who has also made us a wooden modell for our workmen to go by.\\" Etty had been paid nineteen guineas in April of the same year for the model, which survived into the nineteenth century. The west tower in Halfpenny's design was topped by a square, open colonnade with an obelisk-shaped spire. Etty did not envisage a spire, but a wooden one was later added by an unknown hand. Thomas Dunham Whitaker, Vicar of Whalley, Lancashire, in his Loidis and Elmete (1816), remarked of this spire: \\"unquestionably one instance among many of private interference, by which the better judgment of real architects is often overruled, and for which they are unjustly considered as responsible.\\" When the spire blew down in 1839, it was replaced by a taller stone steeple of three diminishing stages (architect: Robert Dennis Chantrell).

Notably, the F-15, (with a crew of two), managed to land safely at a nearby airbase, despite having its right wing almost completely sheared off in the collision. The lifting body properties of the F-15, together with its overabundant engine thrust, allowed the pilot to achieve this unique feat.  Accident  On 1 May 1983, during an Israeli Air Force dissimilar air combat training session over the Negev, an F-15D Eagle (or Baz) collided with an A-4 Skyhawk. The pilot of the Skyhawk was automatically ejected and his aircraft disintegrated. The right wing of the Eagle was sheared off roughly from the root. The crew of the two-seat training version F-15, pilot Ziv Nedivi and instructor Yehoar Gal, did not initially realize the extent of the damage, as fuel leaking profusely and vaporizing at the wing attachment was obscuring their view of the area where the wing once was. The F-15 started rolling uncontrollably after the collision and the instructor ordered an ejection. Nedivi, who outranked the instructor, decided not to eject and attempted recovery by engaging the afterburner, and eventually regained control of the aircraft. He was able to maintain control because of the lift generated by the large areas of the fuselage, stabilators, and remaining wing. Diverting to Ramon Airbase, the F-15 landed at twice the normal speed to maintain the necessary lift, and its tailhook was torn off completely during the landing. Nedivi managed to bring his F-15 to a complete stop approximately from the end of the runway. He was later quoted as saying \\"(I) probably would have ejected if I knew what had happened.\\" However, he also stated that above a certain speed, the F-15 acted \\"like a rocket\\" and did not need wings, effectively becoming something similar to a lifting body.  Aftermath  The aircraft, 106 Squadron's 957 Markia Schakim (, Sky Blazer), was transported by road to an IAF maintenance unit at Tel Nof, where it was repaired. Having already claimed four enemy aircraft during the 1982 Lebanon War, the repaired aircraft was to claim a shared kill of another Syrian MiG-23 on November 19, 1985.

Specifically marketed towards younger children, Sharp Shot is a collection of four simple games where the object is to score points by correctly timing shots at various targets. Gameplay Sharp Shot consists of four separate games: Football Passing, Space Gunner, Submarine and Maze Shoot. In each game, players must push the controller's action button at the right time in order to successfully connect with the target. In the case of Football Passing, for example, points are scored for a successful forward pass, with no points scored if the receiver doesn't catch the ball. Players do not control the movement of their on-screen character, and must simply press the action button when a target passes in range. Each game is timed, with players attempting to score as many points as possible within the given time limit. The \\"Space Gunner\\" and \\"Maze\\" games are the only games out of the four that allows two players to play simultaneously; the other two games require players to switch off after each players turn, with separate score totals maintained for either player. Player 1s score appeared in the top left, and Player 2s would appear in the top right in all four games. Development The games that would become Sharp Shot were originally used for an early version of interactive television known as TV POWWW, in which home players called into local television stations to play for prizes. Players controlled the game by saying \\"Pow!\\" when they wanted to shoot the targets. Later versions of the TV POWWW software were written by the staff at APh Technological Consulting, the company hired by Mattel Electronics to develop the hardware and software for Intellivision. As Mattel was contracted to purchase a certain number of games from APh, the company decided to package the four games together as a simple game for younger children to play. While Mattel's marketing department agreed to promote the game, one of Mattel's vice presidents complained that the game was too simplistic and that consumers would complain that the game was graphically no different than earlier games for the rival Atari 2600. Ultimately, the game was released with a label reiterating that the intended audience was young children. Legacy Sharp Shot was re-released as part of the Intellivision Lives! collection for personal computers and game consoles. The game was also released on Microsoft's Game Room service.

It was made by Gainsborough Pictures at their Islington Studios. It was also released with a music-and-effects soundtrack for cinemas wired for sound. Background The Return of the Rat is the last of a trilogy of films starring Novello as Pierre Boucheron (The Rat) and Jeans as his sometime lover, sometime nemesis Zélie. Marie Ault also appears in all three films. Like its predecessor The Triumph of the Rat, The Return of the Rat does not take the story up from where the previous film had ended, instead opening with a scenario which does not seem to flow logically from the previous film's conclusion. The Triumph of the Rat closes with Pierre destitute and on the street, a situation brought about mainly by Zélie's spite and vindictiveness, yet by the start of The Return of the Rat the couple are married. Contemporary reviewers noted that it seemed implausible in the extreme that the character of Pierre as previously portrayed would have sought charity from the very architect of his downfall, let alone married her. The Return of the Rat is generally considered the weakest of the trilogy, consisting largely of recycled plot devices and set pieces from the earlier films. Another weakness is cited as the jarring, and to all appearances random, interpolation of a pair of comedy Cockney characters whose presence in the Parisian setting seems highly incongruous and does not appear to serve any particular dramatic purpose in the film. The film's technical values are well-regarded however, with film historian Christine Gledhill citing it as \\"Cutts at the height of his visual powers\\".Graham Cutts Gledhill, Christine. BFI Screen Online. Retrieved 21-09-2010 Plot Pierre and Zélie are now married, but it is clear that the union has hit trouble. The latest manifestation of Zélie's restless, capricious nature is heavy gambling, to Pierre's disapproval. He nags her about her habit, but is ignored. Having tamed Pierre, Zélie now finds herself bored with him and starts to flirt openly with the wealthy Henri (Bernard Nedell). Her dismissive attitude towards Pierre, coupled with her continual desire to put him down and belittle him, finally causes him to leave her and return once again to his old haunt, the White Coffin Club. The White Coffin is now ruled by Morel (Gordon Harker), and Pierre has to outwit him in order to reassert his dominance. In the process he attracts the devotion of barmaid Lisette (Poulton). Pierre and his followers hatch an elaborate scheme to humiliate Zélie and gain revenge on her for her transgressions. Matters take a sinister turn when Zélie is murdered during a party she is throwing for her society friends to celebrate her new association with Henri. The police believe they have evidence incriminating Pierre for the crime, and once again he finds himself pursued through the back streets of Paris by the forces of the law. Pierre has to use all his wits and cunning to evade the police while finding evidence to prove the real identity of Zélie's killer.

Phyllostachys bambusoides forma. lacrima-deae is widely encountered. Distribution Phyllostachys bambusoides forma. lacrima-deae, is native to Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang, and especially the Jiuyi Mountains areas of China. Uses The stems of the spotted bamboos are esteemed and cost-effective for making the handles of Chinese brushes, used for calligraphy and painting. Examples of brushes from the eighth century CE (corresponding to the Tang Dynasty, in China) are preserved in the Shōsōin, in Japan; in fact, the prestige value of this type of bamboo was evidently so high at the time that among the Shōsōin treasures are preserved objects made out of some sort of imitation spotted bamboo.Schafer, 134 Legendary origins Legend has it that when Emperor Shun died suddenly during a trip to Cangwu, the tears of his two concubines, (the Xiang River goddesses Ehuang (娥皇) and Nüying (女英)) dropped onto surrounding bamboo and stained it forever. Mottled bamboo is known for being a decorative plant. The Chinese name of originates from the legend. Xiang (湘) refers to the Xiang River, where the story supposedly took place, fei (妃) means \\"concubine\\" and zhu (竹) means \\"bamboo\\", thus the \\"bamboo of the concubines by the Xiang River\\". The term \\"mottled bamboo\\" is also used to describe online discussion board moderators in Mainland China, because when the word for moderator (版主) is entered using the keyboard in Pinyin, the word for mottled bamboo (斑竹) appears as the first option, as they sound very similar.

Although never a member of the Nazi Party he was an early associate of Adolf Hitler and for a while appeared a credible rival for the leadership of the overall Völkisch movement. Early career The son of the celebrated ophthalmologist Albrecht von Graefe, and thus grandson of the surgeon Karl Ferdinand von Graefe, he enlisted in the German Imperial Army as an officer in 1887.Detlef Mühlberger, Hitler's Voice: The Völkischer Beobachter, 1920-1933. Organisation & Development of the Nazi Party, Volume 1, Peter Lang, 2004, p. 103 After his military service von Graefe entered politics and served as a deputy in the Reichstag for the German Conservative Party from 1912 to 1918. Rise to prominence Von Graefe returned to the Reichstag in 1920 as member of the German National People's Party (DNVP). A close associate of Reinhold Wulle, von Graefe was on the far right of the DNVP and as early as 1920 the pair had held negotiations with Adolf Hitler.F.L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, London: Methuen & Co, 1974, p. 106 Between 1919 and 1920 von Graefe personally had come to prominence following the publication of a series of open letters in the German press in which his racialist and anti-Semitic views were attacked by the prominent liberal Gustav Stresemann.Jonathan Wright, Gustav Stresemann: Weimar's Greatest Statesman, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 142 In 1922 von Graefe, Wulle and Wilhelm Henning split from the DNVP to set up their own Völkisch party the German Völkisch Freedom Party (DVFP). The move came after Henning had written an article about Walther Rathenau that was so full of vitriol that Chancellor Joseph Wirth called on his DNVP coalition partners to purge themselves of their extremist members.Hermann Beck, The Fateful Alliance: German Conservatives and Nazis in 1933: The Machtergreifung in a New Light, Berghahn Books, 2009, pp. 36-7 Despite splitting from the DNVP von Graefe remained a member of the Reichstag and held his seat until 1928. Alliance with the Nazis An early ally and rival to Hitler, he had managed to convince the Nazi Party leader that the two groups should limit themselves to certain spheres of influence, with the DVFP active in north Germany and the Nazis in the south. As a consequence of this alliance von Graefe marched in the front row of the Beer Hall Putsch. However he also took advantage of the aftermath by cultivating an alliance with Erich Ludendorff and using this in an attempt to take control of the far right for himself.Douglas G.

Although the plan had Ludendorff's backing it was vetoed by Hitler from prison as he had no desire to surrender leadership to von Graefe or anyone else.Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, p. 122 Nevertheless, a formal alliance that stopped just short of merger was agreed and von Graefe was a member of the Reich leadership of the resulting National Socialist Freedom Movement (NSFB). However von Graefe was not a skilled leader and he bore the brunt of the failure of NSFB, which captured only 14 seats in the December 1924 election, a sharp decline in support for the far right.Eugene Davidson, The Trial of the Germans: An Account of the Twenty-Two Defendants Before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, University of Missouri Press, 1997, pp. 263-4 The group split in 1925, leading to von Graefe and Wulle reforming the DVFP and the establishment of a rivalry with the Nazis.Mühlberger, Hitler's Voice, p. 105 Later years Not long after the schism, von Graefe was injured at a speaking engagement in Frankfurt, in an apparent assassination attempt, when a heckler threw an explosive on stage, forcing the abandonment of the rally. In a 1937 meeting of the Reichstag, this attack was claimed --by Nazi party deputy, Adalbert Gimbel --as having been a strike against a potential rival movement.Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, p. 130 Hitler addressed an open letter to von Graefe in Völkischer Beobachter on 19 March 1926, in which Hitler warned that \\"I was once the drummer and will be the same in the future; but I shall drum only for Germany and not for you and your likes, so help me God\\".Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, p. 131 He left politics altogether in 1928 and died not long after Hitler came to power.

It was originally built in 1909, used as a Franciscan friary and boarding school and purchased by the Maharishi Foundation in 1984. The campus is near the villages of Vlodrop-station and Vlodrop in Limburg, the Netherlands, adjacent to the Dutch–German border and the defunct Iron Rhine railroad, and is surrounded by Meinweg National Park.MERU, Holland History A group of Franciscan brothers from Saxony purchased the land from the owner of a castle in the southern Limburg region of the Netherlands. Kolleg St. Ludwig The college was named after Saint Louis of Toulouse, a saint who was an heir to the throne of Napoli, but who renounced the throne and gave it to his younger brother, and himself became a Franciscan friar, took all the Franciscan vows and served the poor, the sick and the hungry. The seminary building was designed by a monk and featured 600 doors and 1,200 windows, all covered by of roof. Started in 1904 and completed in 1909, it was completely self-sufficient, with its own generators, workshops, wells, fields and orchards. A small-gauge railroad was built first to transport building materials and then to carry the 300 tons of coke used annually for heating. It was evacuated during World War II and reopened as a school in 1951. It closed in 1978. It was attended by over 3,000 male students. Partial demolition The Franciscans sold the property to the Dutch government for use as a police training facility but it was never put to use. The Maharishi Foundation purchased the property in 1984 for US$900,000 and it later became the Maharishi European Research University (MERU) campus as well as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's movement headquarters and residence. The buildings were old, inefficient, in disrepair and did not meet the Maharishi's design standards so his organization entered a two-year \\"courtroom battle\\" with preservationists who tried to block the demolition of the Kollege St. Ludwig building which \\"was abandoned in 1978\\". A three-story, nearly life-sized canvas illustration of the intended replacement building was put up on the front side of the partially demolished building. The local government later ordered its removal. According to a 2008 report, the MERU Foundation indicated it would consider leaving the site if permission to demolish the old building was not granted.

Mills What is the Oldest/Senior Regiment in the British Army? (Archive of the Regiments.org page) although, because it is not a regiment, and was disbanded for decades in the late 20th century, it is not the most senior. History A militia force was organised in accordance with the order on 24 July 1203 of King John to provide a “sufficiency of men and money to defend the Island from the enemy “. In 1214 Eustace the Monk, a pirate, based in Sark arrived under orders from the King of France to harry the Channel Islands. In Guernsey Eustace met a newly raised and locally armed defence force comprising the whole manhood of the Island. This could be considered to be a militia. Jersey would almost certainly have made the same preparations. In 1336, the exiled King David II of Scotland, from his base in France, raided the island of Jersey. The following year, in response to the threat of a repeat of this incursion, King Edward III ordered Thomas de Ferrers, Warden of the Isles, to levy and equip a militia of \\"all men capable of bearing arms, and to form them into companies of thousands, hundreds and twenties, and to lead them well-armed and arrayed for the defence of the islands\\".Royal Jersey Militia ROYAL JERSEY MILITIA REGIMENTAL HISTORYT.F. Mills Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey (Archive of Regiments.org page)This is Jersey David BruceGuernsey Society Thomas de Ferrers This created an organised, compulsory and unpaid, Island militia. Jersey was invaded by French troops in 1461. They were supporters of the Lancastrian force during the Wars of the Roses, as was the Governor of Mont Orgueil, who had surrendered the castle to the French. The militia was not strong enough to retake the castle and instead controlled half of the Island with their base in Grosnez Castle where they stayed until 1468 when the invaders were expelled by a Yorkist English army led by Richard Harliston, supported by the militia commanded by the Seigneur of Saint Ouen and after a siege of Mont Orgueil that lasted 19 weeks.Jersey Heritage The History of the Jersey Militia The help given by the St Ouen militia earned them the honour to parade on the right flank of future militia parades. In 1545, the Jersey Militia consisted of 12 parochial bands, many of which were called into action in 1549 when a force of French pirates, who had captured Sark as a base for their activities landed at Bouley Bay, advancing inland they met the militia who defeated them and driving them back down to the beach, killing up to a thousand in pursuit. In 1555 Parish Companies were ordered to practice every Sunday, weather permitting, firing Arquebus, Bow and arrow and Crossbow. =17th Century= A review undertaken in 1617 showed over 3,000 men, although their arms were defective, with only 12 pikes between them, few muskets, and many were armed with just staves. In 1622 they were organized into three regiments, the North, West and East. The use of the title Colonel for the officer in charge of a regiment appears around 1620, prior to this the commander was called a Captain. During the English Civil War, the Militia had divided loyalties, initially in March 1643 marching on St. Helier to support the arrest of Philippe de Carteret (the Royalist Governor and Bailiff). However, by the end of the year, they rallied to the Royalist cause with the arrival of George Carteret on the Island. The parliamentary supporters were imprisoned or forced to leave the Island and having their property confiscated. In 1646 The future Charles II visited the island and when he returned in 1649, following the execution of his father in London, a ceremony was held in the Royal Square in St. Helier on 17 February 1649 where Charles was publicly proclaimed King (following the first public proclamation in Edinburgh on 5 February 1649). In October 1651 Cromwell sent a fleet of over 80 ships and military force to capture the Island. The parliamentary ships delayed landing for several days, moving from bay to bay, being followed by the 2,000 militia, until after three nights they started landing at St Ouen's Bay. Opposed by a troop of militia cavalry, the invaders suffered casualties, but the militia infantry were dispersed and tired after three days of marching and could not reinforce the landing point faster than the parliamentarian troops were being landed from the ships. Outnumbered, the militia fell back, 340 retiring into Elizabeth Castle, where they had provisions for 8 months, others to Mont Orgueil which was besieged first and following negotiations surrendered with 40 Royalists supporters, who wanted to continue the fight, being allowed to go to Elizabeth Castle, which was then put under siege and after a week, a lucky shot hit a powder store which exploded, killing 6 and burying 40 under rubble. Charles wrote to the garrison to give them permission to surrender, although they held out until 12 December when, following negotiations, the defenders were permitted to travel to France with their money and possessions and the castle surrendered. The militia was reorganized and uniformed in scarlet by the Governor of Jersey, Sir Thomas Morgan, in 1678, and in 1685 a Troop of Horse was raised (which later became Dragoons). Members of the JFS RE(M) wearing traditional full dress uniform =18th Century= Around 1730, the militia was divided into five regiments, based on the Parishes of the island, the 4th Regiment (that of the parishes of Saint Lawrence and Saint Helier) consisting of two battalions. Compulsory military service was introduced in 1771 and the militia was increased to a Regiment of Cavalry, a Regiment of Artillery and five Regiments of Infantry. On 1 May 1779, a Franco-Dutch force attempted a landing at St Ouen's Bay. Early that morning lookouts sighted five large vessels and a great number of boats some three leagues off the coast, proceeding towards the coast in order by a coup de main to effect a landing. Guns on the cutters and small craft supporting the landing fired grapeshot at the defenders on the coast. The defenders, the 78th Regiment of Foot and the Jersey Militia, together with some field artillery force marched to St Ouens bay, the proposed landing beach, the artillery was dragged through the sand of the beaches, arriving in time to oppose the landing. The defenders were able to prevent the landing, suffering only a few men wounded when a cannon burst. The enemy fleet moved to St. Brelade's bay, only to see more defenders ready for them. The proposed invasion was abandoned. The invasion was attempted again but the protecting fleet was intercepted and nearly annihilated. A third attempt managed to get most men ashore undetected on the night of 5 January 1781. Several ships were wrecked losing around 200 men. Marching to St. Helier, the French arrived before dawn, taking the Governor prisoner. Messages were sent to alert the Island Regiments and the Militia who mustered outside the town. The Militia, displaying enthusiastic loyalty, fought alongside Regiments of the regular British Army at the Battle of Jersey, when together they defeated an attempted French invasion (intended to remove the threat the island posed to American shipping in the American Revolutionary War).Monmouth Castle Museum The Royal Jersey Militia 50 regulars and 30 militia were casualties, very few of the French force escaped. On 28 May 1778 the Governor of Jersey, Field Marshal Henry Seymour Conway, submitted plans to Lord Weymouth for the construction of 30 coastal towers to forestall, or at least impede French incursions on the island. King George III granted approval and funding on 5 July 1778. To be manned by the militia and known as Conway's towers, 23 were eventually built. Discontent amongst Methodist militia troopers during the 1780s and 1790s about having to parade on a Sunday was eventually listened to, with the Privy Council agreeing to allow Methodists to drill on weekdays. =19th Century= Three Martello towers were built, 1808 Portlet, 1811 Icho, La Tour de Vinde was completed in 1814 they were built to aid defence of possible landing places. In 1831, the Militia was designated the Royal Jersey Militia on the 50th anniversary of this battle. The facings on uniforms were changed from buff to blue. In 1837 there were five regiments, formed into six battalions, each with a company of artillery. Every resident from 19 to 65 bears arms with 16- to 18-year-olds being trained weekly. The whole militia is unpaid. The regiments were re-organized on several occasions between 1870, when the Troop of Dragoons was disbanded, and the end of the century. Four more Martello towers were built 1835 Lewis, 1834 Kempt, 1837 Victoria and La Collette to further improve Island defences. In 1844 Arsenals were built in each parish, which enabled the artillery to be relocated from the Parish Churches. In 1881 under General Order No 130, the 1st (West), 2nd (East) and 3rd (South) Regiments were permitted the honour of ‘Jersey 1781' A minor mutiny occurred in 1891 at a parade when men in the West Regiment objected to where they were to stand, calling out \\"N'Bouogi Pas!\\". A small number of the ringleaders were found guilty, spent a few days in the prison and were then treated to a meal out in the town by their comrades. =20th Century= In 1905 the militia came under the Army Act and was reorganised to create a regiment of artillery comprising two field and two garrison companies. An engineer company, a medical company and three battalions of infantry. In 1915, one company was detached to the 7th (Service) Battalion, the Royal Irish Rifles.The Long, Long Trail The Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey The militia remained in Jersey throughout the war although many of the men went to serve in British Regiments, 6,292 Jerseymen serving in total, with 862 being killed. In 1917, the 7th Battalion was disbanded and its personnel transferred to 2nd Battalion, The Hampshire Regiment. Other members of the Regiment served as guards at the Blanches Banques Prisoner of War Camp located at St Brélade. The Militia was reconstituted in 1921 as one infantry battalion, the Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey. Plaque, Fort Regent In World War II, the Island was demilitarised, 11 officers and 193 men of the militia left on the SS Hodder to England, where they formed the nucleus of the 11th (Royal Militia Island of Jersey) Battalion, The Hampshire Regiment. It was a training battalion, based in the United Kingdom throughout the war until it was disbanded in 1946. Because the National Service Act did not apply in the Channel Islands, the Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey went into suspended animation (sc. it existed on paper, but had no personnel) until it was formally disbanded, along with the other British Militia regiments, in 1953. Plaque, Saint Helier Harbour =Modern= In 1987, it was re-formed as a Territorial Army regiment, the Jersey Field Squadron (The Royal Militia Island of Jersey), 111th Regiment, Royal Engineers, later 73rd Regiment, Royal Engineers.

Her paternal grandparents were William FitzHugh, 4th Baron FitzHugh and Margery Willoughby. Through her grandfather, the Earl of Salisbury, she was a niece of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (known in history as \\"Warwick, the Kingmaker\\"), and grandniece of Cecily Neville, Duchess of York (the mother of King Edward IV and King Richard III). Elizabeth had nine siblings,The Complete Peerage vol.V, pp. 428-429 including Lady Alice FitzHugh and Richard, 6th Baron FitzHugh (c.1456 - 20 Nov 1487) who married Elizabeth Burgh, daughter of Sir Thomas Burgh, 1st Baron Burgh of Gainsborough and his wife Margaret de Ros. Their son, George FitzHugh, inherited the barony but after his death in 1513, the barony fell in abeyance between Elizabeth and her older sister Alice. This abeyance continues today between the two families.Crofts Peerage Online Baron FitzHugh The current co-heirs to the barony are: * Rachel Douglas-Home, 27th Baroness Dacre née Brand (b. 1929) * Hon.

After her husband Sir William Parr died in 1483, Elizabeth, who was possibly around twenty three at the time, was left with four small children. As a widow, Elizabeth's life revolved around the court. Elizabeth served as lady-in-waiting to Richard III's queen consort, her cousin, Anne Neville. Elizabeth would be second in a four generation span of family that would serve England's queens which started in 1483 with her mother, the redoubtable Alice Neville, Lady FitzHugh. Her granddaughter, Anne Parr would continue the tradition by becoming lady-in-waiting to all six of Henry VIII's wives. Even Anne's sister, Catherine Parr, who later became queen served in the household of the Princess Mary until she caught the eye of King Henry. After the overthrow of the House of York, Elizabeth made a second marriage with a protégé of Margaret Beaufort, Sir Nicholas Vaux (later Baron Vaux), which is reputed to have saved the family fortunes.James, Susan. Catherine Parr: Henry VIII's Last Love. (2009), pg 15, 81. Marriages and Issue She married first William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Kendal, a man maybe 28 years her senior. William was a Knight of the Garter who was held high in favour with King Edward IV, who by marriage was a cousin to him. He fought with the Nevilles on the Yorkist side at the Battle of Edgecote Moor. Elizabeth did not give birth to her first child until she was aged about sixteen. Elizabeth and William had the following children: * Anne Parr (d. 1513), who married Sir Thomas Cheney of Irthlingborough. Their daughter Elizabeth, would go on to marry Thomas Vaux, 2nd Baron Vaux of Harrowden, son of Nicholas Vaux, 1st Baron Vaux of Harrowden by his second wife, Anne Green. This Anne was sister of Maud Green, who married Anne's brother Thomas Parr (below), meaning Anne Green was both aunt and mother-in-law to Elizabeth.

In general, viruses cannot leave behind physical fossils, therefore indirect evidence is used to reconstruct the past. For example, viruses can cause evolution of their hosts, and the signatures of that evolution can be found and interpreted in the present day. Also, some viral genetic fragments which were integrated into germline cells of an ancient organism have been passed down to our time as viral fossils, or endogenous viral elements (EVEs). EVEs that originate from the integration of retroviruses are known as endogenous retroviruses, or ERVs, and most viral fossils are ERVs. They may preserve genetic code from millions of years ago, hence the \\"fossil\\" terminology, although no one has detected a virus in mineral fossils. The most surprising viral fossils originate from non-retroviral DNA and RNA viruses. Terminology Although there is no formal classification system for EVEs, they are categorised according to the taxonomy of their viral origin. Indeed, all known viral genome types and replication strategies, as defined by the Baltimore classification, have been found in the genomic fossil record. Acronyms have been designated to describe different types of viral fossil. *EVE: Endogenous viral element *ERV: Endogenous retrovirus *HERV: Human Endogenous Retrovirus *NIRV: Viral fossils originating from non-retroviral RNA viruses have been termed Non-retroviral Integrated RNA Viruses or NIRVs. Unlike other types of viral fossils, NIRV formation requires borrowing the integration machinery that is coded by the host genome or by a co-infecting retrovirus.

With a history extending back to 1783, it was at the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 one the few operational cider mills in the state of Connecticut. It is presently abandoned. Description and history Allen's Cider Mill stands in the crossroads village of North Granby, on the south side of Mountain Road just west of its junction with Connecticut Route 189. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, set close to the road, with a gable roof and a 1-1/2 story shed addition. Its exterior is finished in vertical board siding. The main facade is three bays wide, with doors in the center and right bays on the ground floor, and square multilight windows in the other bays. The placement of the central door is slightly off-center. The interior contains functional equipment for making cider that dates to the mid-20th century, and vestigial remains of older equipment, including a conveyor mechanism for transporting apples into the mill's hopper. The attic space has traces of plasterwork, indicating it was a finished space, which was probably used for aging cider. and The property on which the cider mill sits has been used for the making of cider since at least 1783, when Silas Cossitt opened a mill across the street. It operated until about 1857, a period when North Granby was one of Connecticut's major cider brandy producing centers. It is believed that the frame of Silas Cossitt's 18th-century house was used in the construction of this building. In the 1860s this building was constructed as an almshouse for the town's indigent population. It was originally located at the road junction, where the present post office stands, and was moved a short way west and converted into a dance hall in the 1870s. It was moved to its present location a few years later, and housed the local Grange chapter. It was adapted for use as a cider mill in 1899.

He was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft. He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines from 2008 to 2011. At Michigan, Martin recorded 172 tackles and appeared in 49 games, including 37 games as the Wolverines' starting nose tackle. He was selected as a second-team All-Big Ten Conference player by both the coaches and media in 2011 and received the same recognition from the coaches in 2010. In high school, he was the state Gatorade Player of the Year in football. He was also a two-time Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) state wrestling champion as well as a two-time MHSAA state shot put champion. High school career Martin attended Detroit Catholic Central High School in Novi, Michigan, where he was a multi-sport athlete competing in football, wrestling and track and field. In football, he recorded 206.5 tackles for Catholic Central and was selected as the Gatorade Player of the Year in Michigan for 2007. Though he only took up wrestling as a junior in high school, he won Michigan's Division I state heavyweight wrestling championship in both 2007 and 2008. He was also a two-time state champion in the shot put, and his 2008 throw of 63 feet, 9 inches came within three inches of breaking the all-time state record set by T. J. Duckett. As a freshman, Martin played alto saxophone in the school marching band during varsity games in addition to playing on the freshman football team. During his sophomore year, he was ranked as the No. 1 junior dog handler for the American Kennel Club. As a football recruit he was ranked as the 7th, 8th and 12th best defensive tackle in the nation by Rivals.com, ESPN, and Scout.com, respectively. College career Martin at the 2009 Fan Appreciation Day during his college days. Martin had been a fan of Michigan football since childhood and gave his oral commitment to head coach Lloyd Carr during an official visit in 2007. When Carr retired after the 2007 season, Martin withdrew his oral commitment and was heavily recruited by both Notre Dame and Michigan State. Martin renewed his commitment to Michigan in January 2008. Martin enrolled at the University of Michigan in the fall of 2008 and played on the Wolverines' defensive line as a true freshman. Michigan head coach Rich Rodriguez said, \\"I don't know if I've ever had a true freshman defensive lineman, I guess, as Division I ready as Mike has been. He's going to keep getting better, so we're excited about him.\\" Martin earned freshman All- American honors and led Michigan's freshmen with 20 tackles. Martin has credited his wrestling technique with helping him against bigger opponents: \\"It's leverage; it's getting under a guy. Just knowing if a guy is on his heels or toes on the line, you're able to feel if he's on his base or not. In wrestling, that's a big aspect of it, because you've got to be able to feel the different motions of a guy.\\" Martin has also credited wrestling with improving his foot and hand speed. As a sophomore in 2009, Martin was the starting nose tackle (sometimes referred to as a nose guard) in all 12 games for Michigan.

Organized labor relations at the Santa Barbara News-Press were highlighted by a 33–6 vote of editorial department employees at the Santa Barbara, California, newspaper on September 27, 2006, to join the Graphic Communications Conference (GCC) of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In August, 2007, the labor board certified the union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the news department employees. The tactics of the newsroom staff included a pledge drive encouraging subscribers to cancel the paper if demands were not met by September 5, 2006, as detailed on their website.savethenewspress.com A branch of the Teamsters has filed many unfair labor practice charges on behalf of the remaining staffers, which have been contested by the News-Press management. On August 31, 2006 eleven of the remaining News-Press newsroom staff received two-day suspension notices from management for allegedly participating in improper union organizing activity; some have claimed, and two NLRB Administrative Law Judges have found, that the activity was protected by labor law, innocuous and consisted only of attempting to deliver a letter to McCaw during a break. The suspended staff were: Al Bonowitz, Melissa Evans, Kim Favors, Dawn Hobbs, Karna Hughes, George Hutti, Rob Kuznia, Barney McManigal, Lara Milton, and Tom Schultz; Mike Traphagen chose to resign earlier than announced rather than accept the suspension.

Four specific points were raised by the News-Press: 1) that supervisors were involved in the election; 2) the Save the News-Press Website confused voters into believing the News-Press itself supported unionization; 3) an anonymous threat on blogabarbara intimidated voters into supporting unionization and 4) newsroom staff engaged in threatening behavior. Many of the principals in the News- Press controversy testified during the two-day hearing.Santa Barbara Independent, Jan. 9, 2007 , Santa Barbara Independent, Jan. 9, 2007 , Santa Barbara Independent, Jan. 10, 2007, Santa Maria Times, Jan. 11, 2007 On March 12, 2007, the NLRB judge issued his decision in favor of the unionization vote on September 27.Santa Barbara Independent, Mar. 15, 2007 , Santa Maria Times, Mar. 13, 2007 In that ruling, eventually upheld by the NLRB in Washington, DC, the ALJ found the key witnesses for the News-Press, Travis Armstrong and Scott Steepleton, to be not credible witnesses, who \\"prevaricated\\", \\"embellished\\" and \\"exaggerated\\" their testimony in an unsuccessful effort to obtain their desired result of thwarting the employees' desire to have union representation. A second NLRB hearing, focused on the propriety of the News- Press firing of reporter Melinda Burns and other issues, originally scheduled for Mar. 12, 2007 was delayed. On March 13, 2007, the NLRB announced that the News-Press would be prosecuted over the firing of Burns, various other issues, and the firing of seven other reporters and one editor. An NLRB attorney wrote that the General Counsel believed the News-Press had violated labor law in its firings of reporters. A News-Press attorney responded that “We’re watching the end of the industry. Journalists think they can write what they want when they want. I don’t know if that can survive in this age.” Attorneys for the News- Press filed their \\"exceptions,\\" a form of appeal, to the NLRB judge's rulings in early April, 2007.Santa Barbara Independent, Apr. 6, 2007 The Teamsters filed their response in mid-April, 2007. On August 11, 2011, the NLRB, in a 3–0 decision including two Democratic NLRB members and one Republican, voted to uphold Judge Kocol's decision in its entirety, and ordered the News-Press to reinstate all eight unlawfully fired reporters and pay them backpay, and have a Notice read aloud to the employees in the presence of management, which is, for the NLRB, an extraordinary remedy.NLRB Decision, August 11, 2011 Later actions A News-Press attorney and accountant entered a meeting between ex-News-Press staff, Teamster officials, and local business people on February 14, 2007. The purpose of the meeting was to encourage advertisers to withhold advertisements from the News-Press. The News-Press attorney accused the ex-News-Press staff of mendacity, was invited to leave by a union representative, and only left when the Teamster representative sarcastically invited him to bargain. The Teamsters have filed a complaint with the NLRB over the incident, asserting that management may not force themselves into labor meetings without an invitation; the News-Press asserts that because the meeting was held in a public building, they were entitled to attend. The Teamsters had paid a fee to use the room where the meeting occurred. The General Counsel of the NLRB prosecuted the News-Press for this among many other violations of federal labor law. The actions of the News-Press attorney and accountant were added as an unfair labor practice charge by the NLRB against the News-Press in early April, 2007. As of April 9, 2007, the NLRB has decided to bring 19 unfair labor practice charges against the News-Press. A hearing on many of these charges is scheduled for August 14, 2007 in Santa Barbara.Santa Barbara News-Press, June 1, 2007 , [http://www.west.net/~smith/blog/index.shtml#nlrbprosecutes Craig Smith Blog, June 1, 2007 , Lompoc Record, June 3, 2007 (archived in WebCite June 3, 2007) In June, 2007, the NLRB announced that two charges against the News-Press, concerning statements made by their attorney and a restatement of their conflict-of-interest policy, had been dropped,Santa Barbara News-Press, June 9, 2007, Page A4. and that they would not require the immediate reinstatement of fired reporters to their jobs. The unfair labor practice hearing lasted 17 days in August and September, 2007, and in December, 2007, the ALJ ruled in favor of the General Counsel and against the News-Press on each of the charges brought against the newspaper, including nine discharges, the cancellation of Starshine Roshell's column, discriminatory evaluations of four reporters, interrogation, surveillance and a demand that employees remove \\"McCaw, Obey the Law\\" signs from their cars and buttons from their clothing. The ALJ again found both Steepleton—who claimed responsibility for all 9 firings held to be unlawful—and Armstrong to be not credible witnesses. The ALJ also found McCaw's testimony not credible. The News-Press maintained throughout the administrative hearing that the union campaign had nothing to do with working conditions but was rather an attempt by a few disgruntled reporters to wrest editorial control of the paper from its management; that the actions of the paper and its owner were wholly within the law; and that the reporters' actions violated the First Amendment freedom of the press. The ALJ rejected all of those contentions. The News-Press did not invoke its First Amendment rights in firing any of the nine people who the ALJ found to have been unlawfully terminated. The News-Press has filed exceptions to the ALJ's ruling, which is pending before the NLRB in Washington. In May 2008, a Federal district court denied injunctive relief sought by the regional director of the National Labor Relations Board in Los Angeles, who had asked for the reinstatement of eight reporters who had been discharged. The court ruled that the newspaper's First Amendment rights to control content were threatened by the reporters' unionization campaign and thus were sufficient to immunize the otherwise possibly unlawful retaliatory firings. On May 22, 2008, Federal Judge Stephen Wilson issued an Order which the newspaper has claimed vindicates the News-Press. The court refused to issue an injunction that would have provided for immediate enforcement of the ALJ's ruling against the News- Press, criticizing some of its reasoning as \\"clearly erroneous.\\" (The ruling does not affect the NLRB's consideration of the ALJ's decision) The Judge found that a theme of the union campaign was to influence editorial control of the paper, and that the ALJ's recommended ruling posed a significant risk of violating the First Amendment rights of the paper. It was the court's unprecedented view that the First Amendment may license the newspaper's management to violate the NLRA in these circumstances. The NLRB has appealed that ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2008, the Teamsters began a campaign to handbill local business owners who advertise in the News- Press. The News-Press filed charges alleging an illegal secondary boycott and acts of intimidation and coercion against local business owners, which the General Counsel referred to the NLRB's Office of Advice for consideration, and after lengthy deliberation, has now dismissed.Santa Barbara News-Press, August 26, 2008, p. A10, \\"Teamsters' actions hurt local workers\\"; Santa Barbara News- Press, August 27, 2008, p. A1, \\"Targets of union boycott fight back\\"; September 11, 2008, p. A6, \\"Police called to scene of Teamsters action against News-Press advertiser\\" The General Counsel's office in Washington, D.C. has rejected the News-Press' appeal of that dismissal. The only allegation of violence occurred when a Teamster representative was struck by an enraged customer who did not agree with the Teamsters' activities. The United States Supreme Court and the California Supreme Court have upheld handbilling of customers of businesses that do business with the employer involved in a labor dispute, citing constitutional concerns if such activity were to be regulated or restricted. The News-Press has filed over 20 unfair labor practice charges against the union, all of which have been dismissed. Bargaining between the union and the News-Press began in November, 2007. The General Counsel of the NLRB has concluded after investigation that the News-Press has bargained in bad faith in violation of federal labor law, and announced in July, 2008 that he will prosecute the News-Press for that refusal to bargain in good faith. In March, 2009, the General Counsel issued a complaint against the News-Press for its bad faith bargaining, and for numerous other unfair labor practices, including ceasing certain employment practices after the union won the election, such as providing annual raises and employee evaluations. Several other charges filed against the News-Press, including interference with the NLRB's investigative processes, were investigated by the General Counsel's staff and have now been authorized for another prosecution against the News- Press. In addition, the General Counsel alleged that the News-Press violated federal labor law by: hiring temporary employees to perform bargaining unit work; hiring an independent contractor to do investigative reporting; bargaining in bad faith by making predictably unacceptable proposals and seeking to maintain unilateral control over terms and conditions of employment; and by discontinuing pre-union practices such as granting annual raises and providing annual evaluations. The General Counsel has also announced he will prosecute the News-Press for illegally firing Dennis Moran, a copy editor and sports writer, who served on the union's bargaining committee, and for interfering with the NLRB's investigative process. That prosecution has now concluded, having consumed over 20 hearing days during May, June, July and August, 2009. On May 28, 2010, ALJ Clifford Anderson found against the News-Press and in favor of the General Counsel, determining that the News-Press violated federal labor law by: bargaining in bad faith without genuine intent to reach agreement; using temporary employees to undermine the bargaining unit; firing a bargaining committee member for illegal reasons based on pretext; discontinuing its longstanding practice of giving annual merit raises; terminating another unit member without notice to the Union; ordering a unilateral change in productivity standards; instructing employees not to discuss terms and conditions of employment discussed at a meeting; discouraging cooperation with NLRB investigations; and changing the employee evaluations procedures. ALJ Anderson found management representative Scott Steepleton's testimony in this hearing to be not credible, which is the third time in three NLRB hearings before three different ALJs that Steepleton has been found to be not truthful. Steepleton then wrote an inaccurate and biased article in the News-Press purporting to describe the ALJ's decision, which did not mention his role in the proceeding, or seek the position of the NLRB or Union. The General Counsel has issued yet another complaint against the News- Press, this time for its attorneys' misconduct in issuing subpoenas in connection with the 2009 hearing before Judge Anderson seeking employees' affidavits provided in confidence to the NLRB's investigators. This is the second time the same attorneys have issued such subpoenas seeking confidential employee affidavits, even though they were admonished by Judge Kocol when they did it the first time. The hearing in that matter, scheduled for October 26, 2009, has been completed. In February, 2010, ALJ Lana Parke found that the News-Press' attorneys did in fact violate federal labor law by issuing the improper subpoenas.

Explanation Pitch is often defined as extending along a one-dimensional continuum from high to low, as can be experienced by sweeping one’s hand up or down a piano keyboard. This continuum is known as pitch height. However pitch also varies in a circular fashion, known as pitch class: as one plays up a keyboard in semitone steps, C, C, D, D, E, F, F, G, G, A, A and B sound in succession, followed by C again, but one octave higher. Because the octave is the most consonant interval after the unison, tones that stand in octave relation, and are so of the same pitch class, have a certain perceptual equivalence--all Cs sound more alike to other Cs than to any other pitch class, as do all Ds, and so on; this creates the auditory equivalent of a Barber's pole. Research on pitch perception Researchers have demonstrated that by creating banks of tones whose note names are clearly defined perceptually but whose perceived heights are ambiguous, one can create scales that appear to ascend or descend endlessly in pitch. Roger Shepard achieved this ambiguity of height by creating banks of complex tones, with each tone composed only of components that stood in octave relationship. In other words, the components of the complex tone C consisted only of Cs, but in different octaves, and the components of the complex tone F consisted only of Fs, but in different octaves. When such complex tones are played in semitone steps the listener perceives a scale that appears to ascend endlessly in pitch. Jean-Claude Risset achieved the same effect using gliding tones instead, so that a single tone appeared to glide up or down endlessly in pitch. Circularity effects based on this principle have been produced in orchestral music and electronic music, by having multiple instruments playing simultaneously in different octaves. Normann et al. PDF Document showed that pitch circularity can be created using a bank of single tones; here the relative amplitudes of the odd and even harmonics of each tone are manipulated so as to create ambiguities of height. A different algorithm that creates ambiguities of pitch height by manipulating the relative amplitudes of the odd and even harmonics, was developed by Diana Deutsch and colleagues. Weblink PDF Document Using this algorithm, gliding tones that appear to ascend or descend endlessly are also produced. This development has led to the intriguing possibility that, using this new algorithm, one might transform banks of natural instrument samples so as to produce tones that sound like those of natural instruments but still have the property of circularity. This development opens up new avenues for music composition and performance.

The reform bill sought to amend section 65 of the Victorian Crimes Act 1958, which had codified the common law offences relating to abortion. The reform also repealed section 10 of the Crimes Act dealing with a separate offence of child destruction. The amendment was moved on behalf of the Brumby Labor Government by the Women's Affairs Minister, Maxine Morand, and was based on a Victorian Law Reform Commission report tabled in the Victorian Parliament on 28 May 2008 which recommended the removal of abortion from the Victorian Crimes Act. All political parties allowed members of Parliament to have a conscience vote, and in October 2008 the bill was passed by both houses, as the Abortion Law Reform Act 2008. Changes Under the Act, a woman is able to access abortion up to a gestational limit of 24 weeks. After that point a medical practitioner is able to provide an abortion if another practitioner agrees that an abortion is appropriate in all the circumstances. As amended by the Abortion Law Reform Act, section 65 of the Crimes Act 1958 states that only a qualified medical practitioner may perform an abortion on another person. A violation carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. Registered nurses and registered pharmacist are also qualified if they are administering a drug or drugs to terminate pregnancy in accordance with the amended act. A female of any age who consents to, or assists in, the performance of an abortion on herself is not guilty of an offence against the section. Abortions after 24 weeks The amended act allows for abortions after 24 weeks, but only if the medical practitioner: * reasonably believes that the abortion is appropriate in all the circumstances, and * has consulted at least one other registered medical practitioner who also reasonably believes that the abortion is appropriate in all the circumstances. In determining whether the circumstances warrant an abortion after 24 weeks, the registered medical practitioner must have regard to: * all relevant medical circumstances, and * the woman's current and future physical, psychological and social circumstances. Medical practitioners who perform abortions after 24 weeks can still face criminal penalties if it is deemed that they have incorrectly determined the \\"appropriateness\\" of the abortion. Only pharmacists employed by a hospital may administer or supply a drug or drugs for an abortion after 24 weeks, and then only at the \\"written direction of a registered medical practitioner\\". Abortion is available in Victoria from 24 week to pre birth with a medical consent. Medical practitioners conscientious objection The act allows medical practitioners and nurses who have a conscientious objection to abortion to refuse to undertake or assist in the procedure, but they must inform the patient of their position, and the patient must also be supplied with information about a medical practitioner who does not have any such objection. Regardless of their personal objections, medical practitioners and nurses have a duty to perform or assist in performing an emergency abortion if the pregnant woman's life is in danger. Attempted amendments During the debate, various members of Parliament moved up to 40 amendments to the bill, the majority of which sought to either change the 24-week upper limit on unrestricted abortions or impose other restrictions. Some of the amendments moved in the Legislative Assembly sought to: *provide support/counselling for women. *provide information to women on the health risks of abortion. *uphold the right of healthcare workers not to participate in abortion or refer someone for an abortion. *ban late- term and partial-birth abortion. *ensure mandatory reporting of suspected child/teenage victims of sexual abuse if a suspected abuser takes them to an abortion clinic. *ensure that the custodial parent of a minor seeking an abortion was informed about the request. *require abortion providers to administer an anaesthetic to the fetus. *protect the life of a child born alive after an abortion. *provide legal protection for an unborn child seriously injured during an assault on the mother. None of the amendments was agreed to by the Assembly. During 2014 Former Liberal MP Geoff Shaw attempted to introduce a series of amendments in a private members bill which included resuscitating babies aborted alive. Shaw's attempt was blocked by then Premier Denis Napthine who voted against the Abortion Law Reform Act in 2008.

The Xiang flowed into Dongting Lake through the ancient kingdom of Chu, whose songs in their worship have been recorded in a work attributed to Qu Yuan. According to the Shanhaijing, the Xiang River deities were daughters of the supreme deity, Di. According to a somewhat later tradition, the Xiang goddesses were daughters of Emperor Yao, who were named Ehuang (; Fairy Radiance) and Nüying (; Maiden Bloom) who were said to have been married by him to his chosen successor, and eventually emperor, Shun, as a sort of test of his administrative abilities: then, later, they became goddesses, after the death of their husband. Shun's wives Shun E Huang and Nü Ying, Qing dynasty, China According to the mythological Ehuang-Nuying version, sometime in the twenty-third century BCE, before becoming divine goddesses, these two daughters of Emperor Yao were married to Shun at the planning of their father. Although later destined to be emperor and exemplar of all the virtues desirable in an emperor and exemplar for all future ages, before the marriage Shun was a simple farmer. Yao, however, was attempting to recruit worthy persons into the service of his government, the main reason being to solve the problem of the ongoing Great Flood that was devastating China. One suggestion from Yao's advisors (Four Mountains) was Shun. Yao inquired what sort of a person Shun was and decided to try him upon being told that (although a direct lineal descendant of Zhuanxu) Shun the farmer was the son of Gu (also known as Gusou): a mean, violent, stupid, and difficult man (also old and blind optically and morally); that Shun lived with him and his proudful and abusive stepmother; and, a half brother, Xiang (who was evil) -- but nevertheless, due to the young (early thirties, but old to be unmarried) Shun's great filial piety the inherent wickedness of the family was kept in-check and outright evil avoided. In an early example of the imperial examinations in Chinese mythology, Yao decided to test the merit of Shun. According to Zhou Dunyi and others, as a test for Shun, Yao married his two daughters Ehuang and Nuying to him and Shun took home his brides. The arrival of the future Xiang River goddesses, Ehuang and Nuying provoked numerous problems: Shun's father had little or no liking for him, his step mother had no love for him, both wanted to seize his dowry of flocks of sheep and other cattle and huge measures of grains which he had received as a part of the marriage, and his half brother Xiang just wanted to kill him and take his wives and some of his other possessions for himself. Shun's father, stepmother, and half brother decided to murder Shun. One day Shun's father, Gu, asked him to repair the roof of a barn, which Shun mentioned to his wives. Ehuang and Nuying warned him of the murder attempt and gave him a magical bird coat. Once Shun was up on the barn roof, his father, old Gu, set the barn on fire and took away the ladder; however, with the aid of the magical bird coat Shun flew to safety. Next, they tried to murder him in a well, but again Ehuang and Nuying had prepared him for survival with a magical dragon coat which allowed him to swim out through a tunnel. Again, Ehuang and Nuying saved Shun from his murderous relatives by giving him a magically antidotal bath which foiled a plot to get him drunk and murder him. There are many versions of this story and some of them omit the wives Ehuang and Nuying. In any case, Yao was well pleased with Shun's observed behavior, who maintained his filial piety while preserving his own interests as well, and so he promoted Shun into his civil service (which also allowed, or obligated, Shun together with Ehuang and Nuying to leave his home and murderous family behind). Later on, after Shun was promoted to emperor, Ehuang and Nuying were said to continue to provide Shun with invaluable advice contributing to his great success. (Murck 2000, 8-9; Wu 1982, 70-71; Yang and others 2005, 202-204). Legend of the spotted bamboo Spotted bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides f. lacrima-deae Keng & Wen), also known as or . The spots that appear on the stems of certain bamboos legendarily first appeared on the bamboo growing by the Xiang River, caused by the tears which fell upon them, shed by Ehuang and Nuying, the two Xiang River goddesses, mourning the disappearance and presumed death of their beloved husband, the Emperor and hero Shun. There are various versions of this mythological story, but, according to one version, in the last year of his reign Shun decided to tour the country of the Xiang River area. According to another version he was engaged in a military expedition versus the \\"Miao\\". Upon his sudden death during this journey, in the \\"Wilderness of Cangwu\\", near the headwaters of the Xiang River in the Jiuyi Mountains (sometimes translated as Doubting Mountain), both of his wives rushed from home to his body (or, in another version, to look for it, but were unable to find it), and then they wept by the river for days: their copious tears falling upon the bamboos by the river, stained them permanently with their spots. The First Qin Emperor and Xiang Jun \\"Autumn Moon over Dongting Lake\\", the lake where the Xiang River Goddesses island shrine was located. By Yokoyama Taikan, from a set of Eight Views of Xiaoxiang. According to Sima Qian's History (Ch.6, \\"Annals of the First Qin Emperor\\"), in the 28th year of his reign (219 BCE), the Qin Emperor went on an excursion, wishing to visit the holy mountain of Heng (the southernmost of the Five Sacred Mountains of China, in present-day in Hunan). However, while attempting to travel there by boat, the emperor suddenly encountered a great wind which nearly prevented his safely reaching land (much less reaching his destination). The incident took place near the shrine of Xiang Jun (on Xiangshan, now an island in Dongting Lake). Upon inquiring about identity of Xiang Jun, the emperor learned that the name referred to the daughters of Yao and the wives of Shun who were buried at this location. Before returning home (by the different Wu Pass land route), the enraged emperor ordered 3000 convict laborers to cut down all of the trees on this mountain, and then to paint the entire mountain red. Part of the reason for the Qin emperor's fury was that the Xiang goddess(es) were patron deities of his old enemies of the Kingdom of Chu; the color red was intended to symbolize the color of the clothing mandated for convicted criminals.

Cleaning agents can be bioactive with consequences ranging from mild to severe. These cleaning products can contain harmful chemicals that have detrimental impacts on the environment. Developmental and endocrine disruptors have been linked to cleaning agents.  Chemicals & their impact  = Alkylphenol ethoxylates = Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs) are widely used in household products such as detergents and all-purpose cleaning products. These specific chemicals are found in 55% of the household cleaning market. They are susceptible to microbial or photochemical degradation into alkylphenols: lipophilic, hormone mimicking compounds. Alkylphenol ethoxylates have been directly linked to endocrine disruption. Further investigation revealed that hormone mimicking alkylphenols affiliate with the oestradiol receptor and averts the proper binding and function of oestradiol. Male trout in alkylphenol contaminated rivers showed reduced testicular growth and synthesized 570,000 times more vitellogenin than the control male trout. The astonishing quantity of vitellogenin, a precursor of lipo- and phosphoproteins that make up egg-yolk protein, in the male trout population from River Lea of England exceeded that of females just before ovulation. ] = Triclosan = Triclosan (TCS) is an anti-microbial chemical that is commonly used in households as an anti- bacterial and anti-fungal agent found in soaps, detergents, and other disinfectants. 96% of household products that contain TCS is eventually discarded down the drain. Thus, TCS is mostly found in aquatic environments, and levels have been tested throughout the US to determine the amounts that are present in the environment. The most notable levels of TCS were found in wastewater (up to 26.2 μg concentration) and extremely high in biosolids found in sewage sludge (up to 35,000 μg concentration). After this wastewater is treated, significant levels of up to 2.7 μg concentration of TCS are still found in water. TCS poses an environmental threat due to its environmental accumulation and persistence, as it is impossible to be removed in its entirety. Overall, TCS is found in 57.6% of all rivers and streams tested throughout the US. In addition, TCS levels are transferred through the water into marine life. Other chemicals that come as a bi-product of TCS are known as degradation products. During wastewater treatment, Methyltriclosan (MTCS) is produced as a result of methylation of TCS, which is not biodegradable and incredibly persistent throughout the environment. In addition, the transformation of TCS during manufacturing leads to the production of dioxins into aquatic habitats. Dioxins have been proven to cause cancer as well as immense developmental issues in almost every vertebrate species. Most notably, TCS has been found in aquatic snails and algae, with levels tested of 500μg kg−1 and 1400μg kg−1. Similarly, MTCS has also been found to bioaccumulate in species, and in aquatic snails and algae, they were tested to have 1200μg kg−1. Thus, the presence of triclosan in the water can pose immense threats to aquatic life as it bioaccumulates. Triclosan chemical structure & common labeling. = Sodium Hypochlorite (household bleach) = Sodium Hypochlorite (SH) is the chemical commonly known as household bleach. SH is a strong chemical used for anti-microbial purposes. Bleach is also a common ingredient in formulas to unclog drains, to wash clothing, and to clean toilets. This means that it is being poured directly into wastewater, which bioaccumulates and cannot be fully filtered out. This chemical poses environmental hazards because it reacts to cause halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Such emissions react with other chemicals to cause the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Sodium Hypochlorite also has carcinogenic properties, which can be cancerous for living organisms. Thus, this chemical contributes greatly to the accumulation of air pollution and smog formation. Sources of Volatile Organic Compounds. \\"Solvent use\\" is the source that originates from cleaning chemicals. = Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia) = Ammonia is a disinfecting chemical that is used in household cleaning products. The most common cleaning products that contain ammonia are floor cleaners and glass cleaners. Ammonia is a significant air pollutant that has accumulated throughout the US. Ammonia is a primary source of nitrogen oxide, which has implications for biodiversity because of toxic implications to plants, which are a food source for many organisms. The ammonia that is not absorbed by plants goes through nitrification processes as a result of the bacteria in water, turning it into nitrates. The presence of ammonium is integral to the nitrogen cycle, which negatively impacts the environment. = Propellant Gas = Products that are packaged in aerosol cans contain a chemical known as propellant gas. Almost always, this propellant gas is called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs have been proven to damage the ozone layer and caused the ozone hole. Thus, in 1996, CFCs were banned directly as a result of the detrimental environmental impacts. This ban came as a result of The Montreal Protocol of 1989, which called for action to reduce and eliminate ozone-depleting substances. Following the ban of CFCs, aerosols are now filled with hydrocarbon or compressed gasses, which have been linked to cause VOCs, which are associated with smog and air pollution. = Phosphates = Phosphates are commonly used as a detergent in a wide array of cleaning products. The most prevalent form of phosphates that are found in household cleaners is pentasodium triphosphate (PTSP). PTSP and other phosphates are unable to be fully removed during wastewater treatment. It has been linked to eutrophication, which entails excessive growth of algae, which absorbs all of the oxygen in the water. Due to lack of oxygen, all aquatic life forms ranging from plants to marine animals will die. Eutrophication is a very serious environmental hazard that can rapidly destroy marine ecosystems, making it impossible for aquatic life to survive in the future. =Government regulation in the US= In terms of regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has headed the regulatory advancements in recent years. For example, in 1976, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was passed. This act called for restrictions on some chemicals, mandatory ingredient reporting, and testing requirements. Some of the chemicals that were restricted included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, lead-based paint, and radon. Section 4 of this act called for testing of chemicals to determine any detrimental impacts that could come as a result. A sector of the EPA focused on \\"compliance monitoring,\\" which ensures that companies are following the guidelines that have been put in place by the TSCA. PCBs have been found in de-dusting agents, so the TCSA has proven important in the mitigation of this chemical in household cleaning. However, the TSCA is primarily focused towards industrial application of chemicals. In 1972, the Clean Water Act was passed, which regulates the wastewater standards and water quality expectations. This act led to the implementation of the EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which requires permits in order to discharge pollutants into the water. This allows for a much stricter regulation regarding the quantities of pollutants that can be discarded.  Packaging  = Aerosol cans = alt= Another prevalent issue with household cleaning products is the packaging that it comes in. As aforementioned, products packaged in aerosol cans currently contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which damages the ozone layer. New aerosol cans that cannot contain the banned CFCs now contain hydrocarbon, which has been linked to the production of VOCs, which contribute greatly to air pollution. In addition, an immense issue with the current packaging of household cleaning products is the lack of ability to biodegrade. = Plastic Packaging = The vast majority of all household product packaging comes in plastic. These common plastics are not biodegradable and accumulate in our oceans. = Aquatic Impact = Overall, it is approximated that there are up to hundreds of thousands of tons of plastic in surface waters. This plastic debris becomes incredibly detrimental to aquatic wildlife. The debris can entangle species or aquatic animals can eat the plastic, which can lead to poisoning and often death. Plastic can also cause immense damage to the ocean floor and negatively disturb the ecosystem. left = Environmentally-friendly alternatives = The EPA suggests purchasing products with recyclable packaging, refillable bottles, and concentrated formulas. Another way to minimize packaging waste is by buying in bulk containers. The EPA cautions against buying anything with packaging that utilizes aerosol sprays or wasteful abundance of packaging. Environmentally benign chemical alternatives Alternative cleaning chemicals can be utilized in households without compromising its ability to clean effectively. The EPA has provided criterion for avoiding environmentally detrimental chemicals in household cleaning. They suggest choosing products with a low VOC content, biodegradability, and those that utilize renewable resources With the aim of decreasing net efficiency, some brands of laundry detergent have been reformulated for use with cold water. By allowing the consumer to use cold water rather than hot, each load cuts back significantly on energy costs. The EPA suggests using products that are designed for use in cold water to conserve energy. = 2-Butoxylethanol, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE) = 2-Butoxyethanol is a common glycol ether used as a solvent in carpet, hard-surface, glass, and oven cleaners owing to its surfactant properties. It is a relatively cheap, volatile solvent of low toxicity.Siegfried Rebsdat, Dieter Mayer \\"Ethylene Glycol\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. .

In late February 2016, it was granted a construction permit to move all the way southwest to Columbus, Georgia, in the far west-central part of the state, to become the FM side of WOKS AM 1340, with 250 watts ERP on 97.5, at about in height. Ordinarily prohibited, the long-distance move is allowed under the FCC's \\"AM revitalization\\" program, which allows AM stations (but not other low-power community stations like LPFM) to take existing FM translators and the service they provide away from their current areas and use them to duplicate their own service in the same area they already serve. History Originally licensed for just five (now 250) watts of effective radiated power, it is owned by Davis Broadcasting of Atlanta. It was originally permitted in 2004 and started in 2007 by Radio Assist Ministry, a company that speculatively filed for thousands of translator stations and then rented or resold them for profit. RAM sold the station to Davis in May 2010. Before the FCC even approved the sale the following month, it applied for and later received a construction permit to move to the WSRV/WSBB (Cox Radio) tower between Gainesville and Atlanta, increase to the maximum translator power of 250 watts, and exponentially increase its height from to . This now gives it the broadcast range of a class-A station, while circumventing Federal Communications Commission (FCC) broadcast licensing, which would otherwise not allow for another station in an already-crowded metropolitan area. The \\"translator\\" was and is still entirely within the main station's range, making it redundant if it were serving a translator station's purpose of retransmitting the main analog audio of its parent station. Independent operation Although W243CE is licensed as a \\"broadcast translator\\" (a service intended to retransmit analog FM stations to distant or terrain-obstructed areas), it is operating independently under an FCC legal fiction that allows such stations to transmit original programming if it is also simulcast on another station's HD Radio digital subchannel — in this case, WSRV's HD3 subchannel on 97.1 FM. Since legitimately licensed noncommercial LPFM stations cannot do any of these things (have multiple stations, operate commercially, use higher powers and unlimited heights, or afford to rent an \\"HD\\" channel or AM station) despite being in the same FCC class D, no community radio stations have gone on-air in or immediately around the city since the 1980s, and two have been forced off-air in the 2000s. Other local \\"translators\\" originating their own programming include W222AF, W233BF, W250BC, and W255CJ. Davis also owns a different station in the area: WLKQ-FM 102.3, which ironically has a translator station (W266BW FM 101.1) owned by a different company. That station transmitted from near W243CE's previous location, and was also upgrading and moving.

The military history of the United Arab Emirates describes the military history of the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. Prior to the union of the emirates, different tribal confederations formed the de facto military force which was dominant in the area now known as the United Arab Emirates. The Bani Yas and Al Qawasim were the most significant of those tribal confederations. The official formation of the military began with the formation of the Truical Oman Levies by the British Empire on 11 May 1951 as the area was under a British protectorate. The Trucial Oman Levies, later renamed to the Trucial Oman Scouts, were for a long time the symbol of public order in eastern Arabia and was commanded by British officers. The force was turned over to the United Arab Emirates as its defense forces when the British residency in the Persian gulf ended and the United Arab Emirates formed in 1971. Prior to the unification of the armed forces, each emirate of the United Arab Emirates was responsible for its own defence. Three major defence forces were formed: the Abu Dhabi Defence Force, Dubai Defence Force, and Ras Al Khaimah Mobile Force. The three later united to form the Federal Defence Force on 6 May 1976 and hence, the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. The UAE's armed forces have engaged in numerous conflicts and war zones since their inception. The UAE Armed Forces were deployed in the Gulf War, Kosovo War, United Nations Operation in Somalia II, War in Afghanistan, enforcing UNSC Resolution 1973 in the 2011 Libyan Civil War, 2014 military intervention against ISIS in Syria, and the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen. Bani Yas and Qawasim Prior to the union of the emirates, different tribal confederations formed the de facto military force which was dominant in the area now known as the United Arab Emirates. The Bani Yas and Al Qawasim were the most significant of those tribal confederations. The Al Qawasim were a major maritime force in the region, which prompted the British Royal Navy to organize several campaigns, such as Persian Gulf campaign of 1809 and Persian Gulf campaign of 1819 and the deployment of ground forces in Ras Al Khaimah to control the trade routes the Al Qawasim dominated. With the signing of the 1820 General Maritime Treaty between the British and the tribal sheikhs and the commencement of the British Residency of the Persian Gulf, the British Empire with the assistance of Sheikh Khalid III bin Muhammad al-Qasimi endeavored to form a unified paramilitary force based in Sharjah to suppress the slave trade and prevent tribal conflicts. The paramilitary force was named the Trucial Oman Levies. Trucial Oman Scouts The current United Arab Emirates military was formed from the historical Trucial Oman Levies which was established on 11 May 1951. The Trucial Oman Levies, which were renamed the Trucial Oman Scouts in 1956, were considered a long symbol of public order in Eastern Arabia and were commanded by British officers from the British Empire. The Trucial Oman Scouts were turned over to the United Arab Emirates as the nucleus of its defense forces in 1971 with the formation of the UAE and were absorbed into the newly formed united military called the Union Defence Force (UDF). The Union Defence Force was established officially as the military of the United Arab Emirates on 27 December 1971 from a directive issued by the UAE's founding father and first president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. Union Defence Force and unification As the Union Defence Force, every emirate was responsible for the equipment and training of its own defence forces. In the event of an attack on any one of the seven emirates, the Union Defence Force would be mobilized from every emirate to defend the attacked emirate. In 1974 the name was changed to the Federal Armed Forces. On 6 May 1976, the Federal Armed Forces were unified as a single body. This was considered a historic event and a large milestone in the military of the United Arab Emirates. May 6 is celebrated annually as the Military Union Day. As a result of the union of forces, the number of personnel formed a brigade and was referred to as the Yarmouk Brigade. After the union of the armed forces in 1976, the Yarmouk Brigade was officially renamed the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. The three largest emirates defence forces which originally formed the Federal Armed Forces, Abu Dhabi Defence Force, Dubai Defence Force, and Ras Al Khaimah Mobile Force, were converted into three major military bases/zones for the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. In 1976 the official UAE Armed Forces insignia, uniform, military academies, air force, and naval force were established and the military General Headquarters (GHQ) was formed in the capital Abu Dhabi. Although initially small in number, the UAE armed forces have grown significantly over the years and are presently equipped with some of the most modern weapon systems, purchased from a variety of outside countries, mainly France, the US and the UK. Most officers are graduates of the United Kingdom's Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, with others having attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and St Cyr, the military academy of France. = Commeration day = The date of the first death in the line of duty of an Emirati soldier was on 30 November 1971 during the Seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs as is celebrated annually as the Commemoration Day. The highest loss of life in the history of the UAE military occurred on Friday 4 September 2015, in which 52 soldiers were killed in Marib area of central Yemen by a Tochka missile which targeted a weapons cache and caused a large explosion. All the names of Emirati soldiers who died in the line of duty are inscribed in the UAE Armed Forces memorial, the Oasis of Dignity, in the capital Abu Dhabi. Deployments A UAE Armed Forces Special Ops soldier assigned to Special Operations Task Force-West, patrols villages in Afghanistan on 7 April 2011. The United Arab Emirates Armed Forces participated in multiple conflicts, mostly in the Middle East. During 1990–1991, the Armed Forces participated in Gulf War. 6 Emirati soldiers lost their lives in liberating Kuwait. The UAE Armed Forces were also deployed in Eastern Europe and joined NATO's Kosovo Force peacekeeping mission undertaking aid missions to thousands of fleeing refugees on the Albanian border. This was the first time Emirati troops uniform was switched to the woodland camouflage compared to their regular home desert camouflage. The UAE Armed Forces also participated in peacekeeping missions in Lebanon and Somalia. The UAE Armed Forces is also the only Arab country to commit troops to maintain security and participate in humanitarian aid missions to Afghanistan. The Emirati special Forces, the Presidential Guards, were deployed to maintain security in War in Afghanistan against the Taliban. In March 2011, the UAE joined the enforcement of the no-fly-zone over Libya by sending six F-16 and six Mirage 2000 multi-role fighter aircraft and in 2015 the UAE joined the Saudi-led coalition intervention in Yemen by sending 30 UAEAF F16 Desert Falcons to Yemen. The intervention was followed by Emirati ground troops deployment in Southern Yemen mainly focusing on targeting terrorist cells such as the Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State.  Conscription  The UAE introduced a mandatory military conscription for adult males in 2014. The national service duration is for 16 months and is intended to bolster the United Arab Emirates military reserve force.

It is operated through a partnership between the Bureau of Land Management, the City of Casper, and the National Historic Trails Center Foundation. The center offers interpretive programs, exhibits, multi-media presentations, and special events. History The idea for an interpretive center in Casper began with the creation of a small trails committee; eventually this committee became the non-profit, National Historic Trails Center Foundation (NHTCF). In 1992 the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) joined with the NHTCF to work on the project, committing to pay half of the $10 million estimated cost. The City of Casper donated 10 acres of land for the center's site. In 1994, voters in Casper passed the Optional One Cent Tax, which helped to fund construction of the center's exhibits. The Wyoming State Legislature also passed a bill to help fund the center that same year. By 1997 plans for the center were complete, and a bill, to support construction and operating costs, passed both houses of congress and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The groundbreaking for construction took place on June 21, 1999 and the center officially opened August 9, 2002.

In a biblical context, the term is used especially in relation to Paul the Apostle and his polemics against the circumcision controversy in early Christianity.See, e.g., Dunn, Paul and the Mosaic Law, p. 265; Tomson, \\"Transformations of Post-70 Judaism,\\" p. 120. The most common form of forced circumcision is performed widely in Israel and the United States, where it is known as neonatal circumcision. This form of circumcision involves the circumcision of a male newborn. Although their parents may consent to it, the males themselves do not, therefore making it forced. Among adults, forced circumcisions have occurred in a wide range of situations, most notably in the compulsory conversion of non-Muslims to Islam\\"Although the Qur'an speaks against forced conversion, such conversions of Christians and Jews took place under Muslim rule until the early decades of the twentieth century.\\" Lerner, Religion, Secular Beliefs and Human Rights, p. 142. and the forced circumcision of Teso, Turkana and Luo men in Kenya, as well as the abduction of South African teenage boys to so-called circumcision schools (\\"bush schools\\").On occurrences of forced circumcision in Kenya, see Glazier, Land and the Uses of Traditions, p. 25; Wamwere, I Refuse to Die, p. 149, passim; Karimi and Ochieng, The Kenyatta Succession, p. 13; Rutten and Owuor, \\"Weapons of mass destruction\\"; Kagwanja, \\"Courting genocide.\\" Regarding the situation in South Africa, see Ndangam, Lifting the Cloak, pp. 211-213; Meintjies, Manhood at a Price; Mayatula and Mavundla, \\"A review on male circumcision procedures\\"; Crowly and Kesner, \\"Ritual Circumcision.\\" In South Africa, custom allows uncircumcised Xhosa-speaking men past the age of circumcision (i.e., 25 years or older) to be overpowered by other men and forcibly circumcised.Funani, Circumcision among the Ama-Xhosa, p. v. History and contemporary forced circumcision =Hasmonean Kingdom (140 BCE–37 BCE)= R1 Maccabees relates the story of how Mattathias (ca. 166 BC) forcibly circumcised the sons of Jewish parents who had abandoned the rite.\\"And Mattathias and his friends went around and tore down the altars; they forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of Israel \\" (1 Macc. 2:45-46, New Revised Standard Version). Forced circumcision of Gentiles by Jews is attested from the second century BC onwards. In 125 BC John Hyrcanus conquered Edom, which the Romans called Idumea; and the Idumeans were converted to Judaism. As reported by Josephus, circumcision was required of the Idumeans as a token of their acceptance of Judaism: Scholars disagree on the interpretation of the sources. For example, Steven Weitzman believes the Idumeans were forcibly circumcised for political, not religious, reasons.Weitzman, \\"Forced Circumcision.\\" According to Shaye J. D. Cohen, \\"Ptolemy's claim, that the Idumaeans were compelled to be circumcised and to adopt Jewish ways, is a simplified account of what these urban Idumaeans experienced.\\"Cohen, \\"Religion, Ethnicity, and Hellenism,\\" p. 216 During the short reign of Hyrcanus' eldest son, Aristobulus I (104-103 BC), the Hasmoneans gained control of Galilee. In this case, too, sources indicate that the residents were subjected to forced circumcision.See, e.g., Fiensy, New Testament Introduction, p. 19. Archaeological evidence suggests that, during this period, Gentiles fled from Galilee to avoid being forcibly circumcised.Charlesworth, \\"Why Evaluate Twenty-five Years,\\" pp. 10-11. Recently, Isaac Soon has argued that 1 Macc 2:46 does not refer to circumcision \\"by force\\" but that Mattathias circumcised \\"in strength.\\" He argues that Mattathias did not forcibly circumcise, but instead re-established circumcision among Jewish inhabitants of Judea \\"in strength.\\" =Roman Empire= Greeks and Romans regarded circumcision as a mutilation of the male genitalia, but the practice is little discussed in Roman literary sources until the second century of the Christian era.Juvenal 14.103–104; Tacitus, Historia 5.5.1–2; Martial 7.30.5, 7.35.3–4, 7.82.5–6, 11.94; Margaret Williams, \\"Jews and Jewish Communities in the Roman Empire,\\" in Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire (Routledge, 2000), p. 325; Mary Smallwood, The Jews under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian (Brill, 1976), p. 431; Jack N. Lightstone, \\"Roman Diaspora Religion,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 362. There was a circumcision controversy in Early Christianity but this was resolved at the Council of Jerusalem c.50 which made it clear that circumcision of gentile converts to Christianity was not required.Acts 15: 5-21 Josephus (who changed his allegiance from the Jews to the Roman Flavians) reports that two Roman officers who had taken refuge with Galileans during the war with Rome (early 67 AD) were put under pressure to convert to Judaism. Josephus, declaring that \\"every one should worship God in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience,\\" claims to have saved the two Gentiles from forced circumcision.Josephus, Life 23 §113; see also Goodman, \\"Galilean Judaism,\\" p. 602; Donaldson, Paul and the Gentiles, p. 323. After the First Roman-Jewish War, a head tax, the Fiscus Judaicus, was levied against all Jews. According to Suetonius, Domitian (c.90) also applied this tax to those who were circumcisied, even if they claimed they were not Jews. Titus Flavius Clemens (consul) was put to death in 95 for adopting Jewish customs. In 96 Nerva relaxed the Jewish tax as applying only to those who professed to be Jews. Sometime between 128 and 132 AD, the emperor Hadrian seems to have temporarily banned circumcision, on pain of death.Peter Schäfer, The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World (Routledge, 1983, 2003), p. 150, and Judeophobia: Attitudes toward Jews in the Ancient World (Harvard University Press, 1997), p. 103, pointing out this depends on a single note on the ban as a cause for the Bar Kokhba revolt in the Historia Augusta, the historical credibility of which is often cast in doubt. Cassius Dio mentions nothing about circumcision in his account of the revolt. See also Smallwood, The Jews under Roman Rule, pp. 430–431, who thinks the ban makes more sense as a punitive measure after the revolt, since it \\"ran completely counter to the long established Roman policy of guaranteeing Jewish religious liberty.\\" Antoninus Pius exempted Jews from the ban,Schäfer, The History of the Jews, p. 150; Smallwood, The Jews under Roman Rule, p. 467. as well as Egyptian priests,Smallwood, The Jews under Roman Rule, p. 470. and Origen (d. ca. 253) says that in his time only Jews were permitted to practice circumcision.Schäfer, Judeophobia, p. 103. Smallwood, The Jews under Roman Rule, p. 469, takes Origen as meaning that circumcision was \\"a solely Jewish rite\\" by his time. Legislation under Constantine, the first Christian emperor, freed any slave who was subjected to circumcision; in the year 339, circumcising a slave became punishable by death.Peter Schäfer, The History of the Jews, p. 185. Although Greco-Roman writers view circumcision as an identifying characteristic of Jews, they believed the practice to have originated in Egypt,Several Greco-Roman writers, such as Strabo, regarded the Jews as of Egyptian descent, in what was apparently their understanding of the Exodus: Schäfer, Judeophobia, pp. 93–94. and recorded it among peoples they identified as Arab, Syrian, Phoenician, Colchian, and Ethiopian; circumcision was a marker of \\"the Other\\".Smallwood, The Jews under Roman Rule, p. 430; Schäfer, Judeophobia, pp. 93–94. Diaspora Jews might circumcise their male slaves as well as adult male converts and Jewish male infants.Lightstone, \\"Roman Diaspora Judaism,\\" p. 363. According to Catherine Hezser, it is an open question whether Jews of late antiquity refrained from forcibly circumcising their Gentile slaves and whether Romans avoided selling their slaves to Jews in reaction to the prohibition.Hezser, Jewish Slavery in Antiquity, p. 42; see also Hezser, \\"Slaves and Slavery.\\" The Mishnah (compiled about 200 AD) is silent on this point, whereas the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (written at the end of the fourth century or later) suggests that Jews might indeed possess uncircumcised slaves.Schorsch, Jews and Blacks, p. 378, n. 24. =Asia and North Africa= Forced conversions, involving forced circumcision, are echoed in a vast body of scholarly literature spanning the entire history of Islam.See, e.g., Lerner, Religion, Secular Beliefs, and Human Rights, p. 142; Ye'or, The Decline of Eastern Christianity, pp. 88-91; Stark, God's Battalions, p. 28; Clarence-Smith, Islam, p. 39, passim; Misra, Identity and Religion, p. 91, passim. Scholars conclude that, during the Islamic conquest of the Middle East and North Africa, forced conversion to Islam through violence or threat of violence did not play a key role. However, taxes and regulations requiring the holders of prestigious positions to become Muslims have been regarded as a form of forced conversion.Firestone, An Introduction to Islam, p. 58; see also Misra, Identity and Religion, p. 172. South Asia In the aftermath of the 1780 Battle of Pollilur, 7,000 British soldiers were held imprisoned by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, more than 300 were forcibly circumcised.Darby, A Surgical Temptation, pp. 32-33; see also Oddy, Religion in South Asia, p. 42, passim. Cromwell Massey, who kept a secret diary during his captivity, wrote: \\"I lost with the foreskin of my yard all those benefits of a Christian and Englishman which were and ever shall be my greatest glory.\\"Colley, Captives, p. 288. Adolescent captives were, in addition to being circumcised, made to wear female clothes. James Bristow, a teenage artilleryman, revenged himself by circumcising dogs, believing that this would harm the religious feelings of the Muslim warders. The prospect of punishment did not deter him, because \\"compelling us to undergo an abhorred operation [was] so base and barbarous an act of aggression, that it was impossible to reflect on it with temper.\\"Lawrence, Captives of Tipu, p. 35. James Scurry, also a prisoner of war, confirms in his book, The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry (1824), that English soldiers, Mangalorean Catholics, and other prisoners were forcibly circumcised. In 1784, when Tipu returned from Mangalore, he brought back tens of thousands of Mangalorean Catholics from Kanara and subjected them to forced circumcision.See, e.g., Naravane, Battles, p. 175. A Hindi idiom 'Mar-mar ke Musalman bana' (meaning 'make Muslim by repeated beating') can be traced to originate from forcible conversion of Hindus. According to Kativa Daiya, during the 1947 partition of India \\"[f]orced circumcision, shaving facial and head hair (for Sikh men), and shaving off the Hindu Brahmin's traditional, short, plaited hair (on an otherwise bald head) were routine Muslim conversion tactics for men and boys.\\"Daiya, Violent Belongings, pp. 69-70. Asia News reported in 2004 that the Justice and Peace Commission of Lahor spoke out against young non-Muslim men in Pakistan being converted and circumcised against their will. In 2005, the Gulf Times discussed a case of forced circumcision of Nepalese boys in Mumbai in the context of sex trade in large Indian cities. Iraq Iraqi Mandaeans, residing almost exclusively in Baghdad and Basra, do not circumcise.See, e.g., Lupieri, The Mandaeans. However, their religious sensitivity on this issue has not prevented hostile rulers from subjecting Mandaean men and boys to forced circumcision.Buckley, The Great Stem of Souls, pp. 149-150. Mandaean communities, especially after the invasion of Iraq, have been subject to \\"murder, kidnapping, rape, forced conversion, forced circumcision and destruction of religious property.\\"Nickerson et al., \\"The impact of fear\\"; see also Nickerson et al., \\"Fear of Cultural Extinction.\\" In Iraq in 2003, shortly after the fall of the Saddam regime, the thirty-five families who made up the Mandean community in Falluja were ordered at gunpoint to adopt Islam; the men were forcibly circumcised. In 2007 the US Committee on International Religious Freedom heard testimony reporting: \\"Forced conversion is happening in an alarming degree. Boys are being kidnapped, forcibly circumcised - a major sin in the Mandaean religion - and forcibly converted to Islam.\\"Testimony of Dr Suhaib Nashi at the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Hearing on Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity, 25 July 2007; see USCIRF press release, \\"USCIRF Hearing: Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity,\\" July 25, 2007 (issued by Judith Ingram). In 2014, after the exodus of the Christians from Mosul and the Yazidis from Mount Sinjar, it was reported that forced circumcisions were taking place conducted by the Islamic State http://www.tunisiadaily.com/2014/08/16/irak-circoncisions-de-chretiens- et-700-femmes-yazidies-vendues-a-150-dollars-piece/ Anatolia =The Ottoman Empire= There are accounts of Christian boys abducted and forcibly circumcised even in the nineteenth century.Jacques, The Albanians, p. 222. In 1829, 9 year old Greek boy Alexandros Kitos and other young boys were kidnapped by Ottoman soldiers and sold into slavery in Egypt, all were circumcised against their will.The Greek War of Independence the struggle for freedom from Ottoman oppression pg. 110 It is well established that, before and during the Armenian Genocide, forced conversions (involving forced circumcisions) of Armenian boys and men were frequent.See, e.g., Bobelian, Children of Armenia, pp. 28-29. \\"In many cases young Armenian children were spared from deportation by local Turks who took them from their families. The children were coerced into denouncing Christianity and becoming Muslims, and were then given new Turkish names. For Armenian boys the forced conversion meant they each had to endure painful circumcision as required by Islamic custom.\\" Turkey During the Istanbul Pogrom in September 1955, \\"many Greek men, including at least one priest, were subjected to forced circumcision.\\"Zayas, \\"The Istanbul Pogrom\\"; see also Vryonis, The Mechanism of Catastrophe, pp. 224-226, passim. As a result of the pogrom, the Greek minority eventually emigrated from Turkey. In 2002 there was a report that non-Muslim army recruits in Turkey had been threatened with forced circumcision. Cases are documented where Syro-Orthodox men serving in the Turkish military forces have been threatened with forced circumcision.Carlier, Who Is a Refugee, pp. 128-129, 132. In 1991, a young Christian Turk, fleeing from forced circumcision in the Turkish military forces, was granted asylum in Germany.Zabus, Between Rites and Rights, p. 233. The Yazidi (not all of whom are circumcised) in Turkey have for years been subjected to direct state persecution, including compulsory religious instruction at school, forced conversion, forced circumcision, and mistreatment during military service.Carlier, Who Is a Refugee, p. 150, n. 203; see also Jwaideh, The Kurdish National Movement, p. 20. In 1999 there was a report of the forced circumcision of Yedizi men in Turkish Kurdistan. The Arab world John Rawlins had sailed for 23 years without incident when, in 1621, he and his crew were kidnapped by pirates from the Barbary Coast of North Africa. Rawlins later reported that, after being taken to Algiers, two younger men were \\"by force and torment ... compelled ... to turn Turks,\\" which means that they were forcibly circumcised.Fuller, \\"John Rawlins\\"; see also DiPiero, White Men Aren't, p. 69. By organizing a successful mutiny, he was able to return home in 1622. The Portuguese Friar Jaono dos Sanctos claimed that, annually in Algiers in the 1620s, more than nine hundred Christian slaves were converted to Islam, \\"besides about fifty boys yearly circumcised against their wills.\\"Quoted in Davis, Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters, p. 22. Indonesia =Maluku Islands= Thousands of Christians were forcibly circumcised in the Moluccas to convert them forcibly to Islam from December 1999 to January 2001.Lipton, Religious Freedom in Asia, p. 124. The Sydney Morning Herald reported in detail on this, stating that \\"almost all\\" of 3,928 villagers forced to convert to Islam were circumcised. Razors and knives were reused, causing infections. One of those circumcised, Kostantinus Idi, reported: \\"I could not escape,\\" he said. \\"One of them held up my foreskin between pieces of wood while another cut me with a razor ...the third man held my head back, ready to pour water down my throat if I screamed. But I couldn't help but scream and he poured the water. I kept screaming aloud and vomited. I couldn't stand the pain.\\" He further reported that one of the clerics urinated on his wound, saying it would stop infection. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the forced conversions and forced circumcisions had been condemned by moderate Muslim leaders who said they were contrary to Islamic teachings. The local governor had also investigated the incidents. =Africa south of the Sahara= Ethiopia Marco Polo, in his Travels, relates how a Christian king of Ethiopia took revenge on the Sultan of Aden, who had forcibly circumcised a bishop.The Travels of Marco Polo, Book 3, Chapter 35; see also Strickland, Saracens, Demons, & Jews, p. 159. Kenya In Kenya, most tribes circumcise. Luo men from Western Kenya are a significant exception, for which reason they have regularly been subjected to forced circumcision.See, e.g., Glazier, Land and the Uses of Traditions, p. 25. In August 2002, following a violent incident in Butere/Mumias District, a district commissioner instructed the police to \\"crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision.\\" In November 2005, the Kenyan Human Rights Commission announced that it would seek prosecutions against politicians for inciting such violence. In one instance, a cabinet minister had said, \\"Those who are not circumcised should be taken for a circumcision ceremony.\\" The Commission said this amounted to an incitement to violence. In late January 2008, a disputed election in which circumcision became an issue between President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu and opposition candidate Raila Odinga, a Luo, \\"the fact that Odinga was uncircumcised became an issue: He was seen by some Kikuyus as a 'child' unfit to rule because he had not passed through circumcision and initiation.\\" Post-election violence reportedly \\"focused on tribal animosities\\", and included several cases of forced circumcision. AFP reported one Kenyan man's experience: \\"A group of eight men with pangas (machetes) entered. They asked for my ID [to determine what tribe he belonged to] They slashed me and they circumcised me by force. I screamed a lot and cried for help...' He complained that police left him in a pool of blood, taking weapons left behind by the Kikuyu gang. In September 2010, at Malaba, West Kenya, a 21-year-old Teso man was lured to a hotel, drugged, smeared with fermented millet flour and was being led away by several Bukusu to be circumcised when the police intervened. The Teso man, who agreed to a medical circumcision, condemned the Bukusu youths for trying to impose their culture on the Teso. Three weeks previously, village neighbours in Aedomoru sub location in Teso north armed themselves with clubs and prevented a 35-year-old man from being forcibly circumcised. South Africa In 1999, a woman who was feared throughout the Vaal Triangle district of South Africa, controlled a gang of kidnappers that abducted young people, forcibly circumcising the boys and extorting ransoms from their parents for their release. A local police officer said as many as 10 teenagers had been snatched every day. In 2004, a 22-year-old Rastafari convert was seized by relatives and forcibly circumcised by group of Xhosa tribal elders and relatives. In December 2004, 45-year-old Nceba Cekiso was caught and circumcised against his will. The report in the Cape Argus noted, > \\"Xhosa culture allows people to forcibly circumcise boys deemed to be past > the age of initiation... Forcing people do undergo the ancient ritual ... > has, in recent times, caused concern among human rights organisations... > (In) one instance two Rastafarians objected to the procedure on religious > grounds. The incident has sparked a debate on whether or not traditionalists > should still be allowed to force people against their will into the bush to > undergo initiation. Despite being medically circumcised, a Christian Xhosa was forcibly recircumcised by his father and community leaders in 2007. He laid a charge of unfair discrimination on the grounds of his religious beliefs, seeking an apology from his father and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. In the settlement that was reached, and which was made an order of the Equality Court, the Congress of Traditional Leaders accepted the right of adult males to choose whether to attend traditional circumcision schools according to their religious beliefs. It apologised for the comments made by its former chairman encouraging the ostracism of teenagers who refused to undergo traditional circumcision. The judge declared, \\"What is important in terms of the Constitution and law is that no one can be forced to submit to circumcision without his consent.\\" According to South African newspapers, the subsequent trial became \\"a landmark case around forced circumcision.\\" In October 2009, the Bhisho Equality Court (High Court) ruled that, in South Africa, circumcision is unlawful unless done with the full consent of the initiate. According to Thembela Kepe, traditional leaders allege that the ban on forced circumcision is \\"a violation of cultural rights enshrined in the Constitution.\\"Kepe, \\"'Secrets' that kill.\\" Sudan There is ample evidence that, for years, Christians of Khartoum and elsewhere in Sudan have been forcefully converted to Islam, and that Christian men and boys have been forcibly circumcised.See \\"Sudan: Reports of Catholic residents of Khartoum or elsewhere in Sudan being forcefully converted to Islam\\", Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 19 October 2001, and references therein; see also Akol, Burden of Nationality, pp. 25-72. According to the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000, February 2001 (United States Department of State, Washington, DC), non-Muslim Sudanese boys kidnapped off the streets have undergone forced circumcision in government camps and juvenile houses; see Examples of Dinka boys having been forcibly circumcised in the 1990s and 2000s are known from the context of traditional slavery,Lobban, \\"Slavery in the Sudan.\\" The article is available online: Stephanie Beswick, \\"The Ethnicity of Bondage in the Valley of the Upper Nile: Slavery and the Slave Trade through the Eyes of the Possessed,\\" paper presented at the 6–8 April 2000 meetings of the Sudan Studies Association, Vassar College. See also Michael Coren, \\"Sudan's Slaves,\\" Frontpage, Toronto, Ontario, 25 November 2003: still endemic in Sudan. Uganda In 1885, Kabaka Mwanga ordered the murders of Bishop James Hannington and many local Christians. During the following period, Islamization led to several Christians being forcibly circumcised.Otiso, Culture and Customs of Uganda, p. xvii. As discussed by anthropologist Suzette Heald and other scholars, the Gisu (alternatively, Bagishu) of Uganda \\"take pride in not tolerating uncircumcised men.\\" For this reason, in Gisu society, any boy or man who has been able to escape ritual circumcision (called \\"imbalu\\") faces the prospect of being forcibly circumcised.Heald, Manhood and Morality, p. 13. Voice of America, referring to the same practice, reports: \\"Among the Bagishu, uncircumcised men are treated with contempt; they are not allowed in society and in most cases they are seen as failing to get local women for marriage. This is supported by all the Bagishu including women who often report uncircumcised men to tribal elders. It's considered traditional that no male is to escape the ritual regardless of where he lives, what he does or what kind of security he has.\\" In 2004 a father of seven was seized and forcibly circumcised after his wife told Bagishu tribal circumcisers that he was uncircumcised. A local official said the authorities could not intervene in a cultural ritual.\\"Bagisu flee circumcision\\", The Monitor, Kampala, 25 August 2004.

Other tribal groups in Uganda and the Ugandan Foundation for Human Rights Initiative regard forced circumcision as a human rights abuse.Peterson Ssendi, \\"Ugandan Ethnic Group Criticized for Forced Male Circumcision,\\" Voice of America, Kampala, 23 March 2007, http://www.voanews.com/english/Africa/2007-03-23-voa58.cfm accessed 12 June 2008 but no longer available at that address. The Ugandan Government and the President of the Ugandan Law Society condemned the incident,\\"Culture vs law: On forced circumcision,\\" Sunday Vision, 29 June 2008 accessed 6 October 2010 but the victim refused to press charges.Godfrey Kimono and Ronnie Kijjambu, \\"Mujoroto now a 'total man,'\\" New Vision Uganda, 27 June 2008, accessed 6 October 2010 =Australia= Traditional circumcision is still practised in some tribal areas of Australia.See, e.g., DeMello, Encyclopedia, p. 64. Linguist and anthropologist Peter Sutton, commenting on forced circumcision and the absence of law enforcement in remote settlements, claims that Australian law has been applied in a patchy way: \\"Involuntary circumcision has long been widely accepted as being de facto outside the scope of Australian law.\\"Sutton, The Politics of Suffering, p. 112. Late in 1996, 34-year-old Irwin Brookdale was drinking with a group of Australian Aborigines on the banks of a river in far north Queensland. After he passed out, a woman in the group felt down his pants, found that he was not circumcised and called on her companions to \\"make a man out of him.\\" They attempted to circumcise him with a broken beer bottle. Brookdale ended up in hospital, one of his assailants was convicted of unlawful wounding and Brookdale was awarded A$10,000 compensation for nervous shock. =Other geographical areas= Breakup of Yugoslavia The breakup of Yugoslavia, according to Milica Z. Bookman, \\"was extremely violent, producing some two million refugees, over 100,000 killed, and evidence of gang rape, impaling, dismemberment and forced circumcision.\\"Bookman, \\"War and Peace.\\" The US Department of State reported that Muslim and Mujahedin irregular troops \\"had routinely performed crude, disfiguring, nonmedical circumcisions on Bosnian Serb soldiers.\\" One 18-year- old Bosnian Serb soldier \\"was so brutally circumcised that eventually the entire organ required amputation.\\"Fourth Report on War Crimes in the Former Yugoslavia: Part II—Torture of Prisoners, US Department of State Dispatch, vol. 3, no. 52, 28 December 1992, quoted in Kohlmann, Al-Qaida's Jihad in Europe, p. 30.

The long case is very large and provides performance that exceeds existing commercial magnums, such as the .300 Winchester Magnum and .300 Weatherby Magnum.

The New Science ( ) is the major work of Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico. It was first published in 1725 to little success, but has gone on to be highly regarded and influential in the philosophy of history, sociology, and anthropology. The central concepts were highly original and prefigured the Age of Enlightenment. Titles The full title of the 1725 edition was ',. ending with a dedication to Cardinal Lorenzo Corsini, the future .

The 1744 edition was slightly emended to '. (\\"Giambattista Vico's Principles of New Science Concerning Nations' Shared Nature\\"), without a title page dedication. (Clement had died in 1740 and Vico in 1744, before the edition's publication.) Creation In 1720, Vico began work on the Scienza Nuova as part of a treatise on universal rights. Although it was originally supposed to be sponsored by Cardinal Corsini, Vico was forced to finance the publication himself after the cardinal pleaded financial difficulty and withdrew his patronage. It was the first work by Vico to be written in Italian, since his previous ones had been in Latin. The first edition of the New Science appeared in 1725. Vico worked on two heavily revised editions. The first was published in 1730, the second posthumously in 1744. Approach, style and tone In its first section, titled \\"Idea of the Work\\" ('), the 1730 and 1744 editions of The New Science explicitly present themselves as a \\"science of reasoning\\" ('). The work (especially the section \\"Of the Elements\\") includes a dialectic between axioms (authoritative maxims or ') and \\"reasonings\\" (') linking and clarifying the axioms. Vico began the third edition with a detailed close reading of a front piece portrait, examining the place of Gentile nations within the providential guidance of the Hebrew God. This portrait contains a number of images that are symbolically ascribed to the flow of human history. A triangle with the Eye of Providence appears in the top left. A beam of light from the eye shines upon a brooch attached to the breastplate of “the lady with the winged temples who surmounts the celestial globe or world of nature” (center right), which represents metaphysics. The beam reflects off the brooch onto the back of a robed character standing upon a pedestal (bottom left), representing the poet Homer. All around these main characters resides a variety of objects that represent the stages of human history which Vico categorizes into three epochs: the age of the gods “in which the gentiles believed they lived under divine governments, and everything was commanded them by auspices and oracles, which are the oldest institutions in profane history; the age of the heroes \\"in which they reigned everywhere in aristocratic commonwealths, on account of a certain superiority of nature which they held themselves to have over the plebs (or peasants);\\" and the age of men \\"in which all men recognized themselves as equal in human nature, and therefore there were established first the popular commonwealths and then the monarchies, both of which are forms of human government.\\" By viewing these principles as universal phenomena which combined nature and government with language and philology, Vico could insert the history of the Gentile nations into the supreme guidance by divine providence. According to Vico, the proper end for government resulted with society entering into a state of universal equity: \\"The last type of jurisprudence was that of natural equity, which reigns naturally in the free commonwealths, in which the people, each for his own particular good (without understanding that it is the same for all), are led to command universal laws. They naturally desire these laws to bend benignly to the least details of matters calling for equal unity.\\" Vico specifies that his \\"science\\" reasons primarily about the function of religion in the human world (\\"Idea of the Work\\"), and in this respect the work \\"comes to be a civil theology reasoned from divine providence\\" ('). Reconsidering divine providence within a human or political context, Vico unearths the \\"poetic theologians\\" (') of pagan antiquity, exposing the poetic character of theology independently of Christianity's sacred history and thus of Biblical authority.See, e.g. the 1744 edition's \\"Of the Elements,\\" CXIV. Vico's use of poetic theology, anticipated in his 1710 work De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia (\\"On the Ancient Wisdom of the Italians\\"), confirms his ties to the Italian Renaissance and its own appeals to '. With the early Renaissance, Vico shares the call for recovering a \\"pagan\\" or \\"vulgar\\" horizon for philosophy's providential agency or for recognizing the providence of our human \\"metaphysical\\" minds (') in the world of our \\"political\\" wills (').\\"Idea of the Work,\\" par. 2. \\"Poetic theology\\" would serve as stage for an \\"ascent\\" to recognize the inherence or latency of rational agency in our actions, even when these are brutal.See \\"Of the Method,\\" par. 2. This way, the particular providence of the Bible's \\"true God\\"\\"Of the Elements,\\" CXIV. would not be required for the thriving of properly human life. All that would be needed was (A) false religions and gods and (B) the covert work of the ' (the rational principle of a constitution of experience rooted in its proper infinite form), which was examined at length in ' and evoked again in the section \\"Of the Method\\" in the 1730 and 1744 editions of The New Science.Par. 2. Cyclical history (Corsi e ricorsi?) Vico is often seen as espousing a cyclical philosophy of history where human history is created by man, although Vico never speaks of \\"history without attributes\\" (Paolo Cristofolini, Vice Pagano e Barbaro), but of a \\"world of nations\\". Which is more, in the 1744 Scienza Nuova (esp. the \\"Conclusion of the Work\\") Vico stresses that \\"the world of nations\\" is made by men merely with respect to their sense of certainty (certamente), though not fundamentally, insofar as the world is guided by the human mind \\"metaphysically\\" independent of its makings (compare opening paragraph of the Scienza Nuova). Furthermore, although Vico is often attributed the expression \\"corsi e ricorsi\\" (cycles and counter cycles of growth and decayhttps://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803115641991) of \\"history\\", he never speaks in the plural of \\"the cycle\\" or of \\"the counter- cycle\\" (ricorso) of \\"human things\\", suggesting that political life and order, or human creations, are oriented \\"backward,\\" as it were, or called back to their constitutive \\"metaphysical\\" principle. On present day \\"constructivist\\" readings, Vico is supposed to have promoted a vision of man and society as moving in parallel from barbarism to civilization. > As societies become more developed socially, human nature also develops, and > both manifest their development in changes in language, myth, folklore, > economy, etc.; in short, social change produces cultural change. Vico would therefore be using an original organic idea that culture is a system of socially produced and structured elements. Hence, knowledge of any society would come from the social structure of that society, explicable, therefore, only in terms of its own language. As such, one may find a dialectical relationship between language, knowledge and social structure. Relying on a complex etymology, Vico argues in the Scienza Nuova that civilization develops in a recurring cycle (ricorso) of three ages: the divine, the heroic, and the human. Each age exhibits distinct political and social features and can be characterized by master tropes or figures of language. The giganti of the divine age rely on metaphor to compare, and thus comprehend, human and natural phenomena. In the heroic age, metonymy and synecdoche support the development of feudal or monarchic institutions embodied by idealized figures. The final age is characterized by popular democracy and reflection via irony; in this epoch, the rise of rationality leads to barbarie della reflessione or barbarism of reflection, and civilization descends once more into the poetic era. Taken together, the recurring cycle of three agescommon to every nationconstitutes for Vico a storia ideale eterna or ideal eternal history. Therefore, it can be said that all history is the history of the rise and fall of civilizations, for which Vico provides evidence (up until, and including the Graeco-Roman historians). Ideas on rhetoric applied to history Vico’s humanism (his returning to a pre-modern form of reasoning), his interest in classical rhetoric and philology, and his response to Descartes contribute to the philosophical foundations for the second Scienza Nuova. Through an elaborate Latin etymology, Vico establishes not only the distinguishing features of first humans, but also how early civilization developed out of a sensus communis or common (not collective) sense. Beginning with the first form of authority intuited by the giganti or early humans and transposed in their first \\"mute\\" or \\"sign\\" language, Vico concludes that “first, or vulgar, wisdom was poetic in nature.” This observation is not an aesthetic one, but rather points to the capacity inherent in all men to imagine meaning via comparison and to reach a communal \\"conscience\\" or \\"prejudice\\" about their surroundings. The metaphors that define the poetic age gradually yield to the first civic discourse, finally leading to a time characterized by \\"full-fledged reason\\" (ragione tutta spiegata), in which reason and right are exposed to the point that they vanish into their own superficial appearance. At this point, speech returns to its primitive condition, and with it men. Hence the \\"recurring\\" (ricorso) of life to \\"barbarism\\" (barbarie). It is by way of warning his age and those stemming from it of the danger of seeking truth in clear and distinct ideas blinding us to the real depths of life, that Vico calls our attention back to a classical art of moderating the course of human things, lest the liberty enjoyed in the \\"Republic\\" be supplanted by the anarchic tyranny of the senses. Crucial to Vico's work remains a subtle criticism of all attempts to impose universality upon particularity, as if ex nihilo. Instead, Vico attempts to always let \\"the true\\" emerge from \\"the certain\\" through innumerable stories and anecdotes drawn mostly from the history of Greece and Rome and from the Bible. Here, reason does not attempt to overcome the poetic dimension of life and speech, but to moderate its impulses so as to safeguard civil life. While the transfer from divine to heroic to human ages is, for Vico, marked by shifts in the tropological nature of language, the inventional aspect of the poetic principle remains constant. When referring to “poets”, Vico intends to evoke the original Greek sense of “creators”. In the Scienza Nuova, then, the verum factum principle first put forth in De Italorum Sapientia remains central. As such, the notion of topics as the loci or places of invention (put forth by Aristotle and developed throughout classical rhetoric) serves as the foundation for \\"the true\\", and thus, as the underlying principle of sensus communis and civic discourse. The development of laws that shape the social and political character of each age is informed as much by master tropes as by those topics deemed acceptable in each era. Thus, for the rudimentary civilization of the divine age, sensory topics are employed to develop laws applicable on an individual basis. These laws expand as metonymy and synecdoche enable notions of sovereign rule in the heroic age; accordingly, acceptable topics expand to include notions of class and division. In the final, human age, the reflection that enables popular democracy requires appeals to any and all topics to achieve a common, rational law that is universally applicable. The development of civilization in Vico’s storia ideale eterna, then, is rooted in the first canon of rhetoric, as invention via loci shapes both the creation of and discourse about civil life. Reception and later influence Vico’s major work was poorly received during his own life but has since inspired a cadre of famous thinkers and artists, including Karl Marx and Montesquieu.Reiner Grundmann, 1991. Marxism and Ecology. Oxford University Press Later his work was received more favourably as in the case of Lord Monboddo to whom he was compared in a modern treatise.Hobbs, Catherine, Rhetoric on the Margin of Modernity, Vico, Condillac, Monboddo, Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, Illinois (1992) Isaiah Berlin has devoted attention to Vico as a critic of the Enlightenment and a significant humanist and culture theorist.Berlin, Isaiah, Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas, Chatto and Windus, 1976. Redwood Burn Ltd.. .Berlin, Isaiah, Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder, Pimlico, 2000. . Scienza Nuova was included by Martin Seymour- Smith in his book The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written. The historical cycle provides the structure for James Joyce's book, Finnegans Wake. The intertextual relationship between Scienza Nuova and Finnegans Wake was brought to light by Samuel Beckett in his essay \\"Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce” published in Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress (1929), where Beckett argued that Vico's conception of language also had significant influence in Joyce's work. Vico's notion of the lingua mentale commune (mental dictionary) in relation to universale fantastico reverberates in Joyce's novel, which ends in the middle of a sentence, reasserting Vico's principle of cyclical history.Verene, Donald Phillip. Vico and Joyce. Albany: State University of New York, 1987. Print. Language, knowledge and society are in a dialectical relationship, which means that any study or comparison of societies must consider the specific contexts of the societies.

In 1985, he founded Consumer Watchdog, a nationally recognized, nonpartisan nonprofit public interest group. He serves as the group's counsel. He is best known for drafting, and organizing the campaign for, Proposition 103, a ballot proposal that rolled back automobile insurance rates in California. In 2014, the Consumer Federation of America estimated that Proposition 103 has saved California consumers over $100 billion since 1988.http://www.consumerwatchdogwatch.com/#div4a Rosenfield's consumer advocacy work focuses on insurance company overcharges, health care patient protection, and other consumer rights.http://www.harveyrosenfield.com/index.php?page=current-work Early life and education Rosenfield was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1952 and grew up in Randolph. His father was an accountant and his mother, a painter and poet.Muir, p5 In 1970, Harvey Rosenfield was involved in his first grass roots campaign: the \\"Smoke Out\\" at Randolph High School. The campaign encouraged community members to give up smoking for a day and donate the monetary equivalent of a pack of cigarettes to a scholarship fund. Rosenfield's high school guidance counselor, Art Mullaney, originated the idea and Rosenfield attributes his \\"success to [Mullaney]\\" and others who mentored him. The group raised $4500 and attracted the attention of the American Cancer Society, which used the \\"smokeout\\" theme in its \\"Great American Smokeout\\" campaign, beginning in 1977. In 1970 Rosenfield entered Amherst College and studied psychology, though he later decided to pursue studies in law. After graduating magna cum laude in 1974, Rosenfield moved to Washington, D.C. to intern with Massachusetts Congressman Michael Harrington. In the fall of 1974, he began a joint degree in law and international affairs at Georgetown University. Early career In 1976, Rosenfield took a $600 internship with his future mentor, Ralph Nader at Public Citizen, a Washington D.C. citizen advocacy group. Three years later, after graduating from Georgetown, Rosenfield began working full-time for Nader's Public Citizen Congress Watch as an energy lobbyist opposing nuclear power in 1979. Rosenfield fought for alternative energy sources and environmental conservation in the wake of the 1979 oil crisis when Congress considered a fossil fuels and nuclear strategy for energy independence. Nader asked Rosenfield to go to California and help organize the California Public Interest Research Group (CalPIRG) in 1981. As program director, he lobbied on a variety of issues including utility and campaign finance reform and public access to government. The goal was to \\"bring Nader style advocacy to the West Coast.\\" Rosenfield resigned from CalPIRG in 1985. Later that year, Nader asked him to campaign against Proposition 51, an insurance industry backed initiative on the California ballot that limited damage claims on lawsuits, which the industry claimed were responsible for skyrocketing insurance rates. Consumer Watchdog During the same period he was fighting against Proposition 51, Rosenfield founded Consumer Watchdog (originally the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights). Proposition 51 passed, but Rosenfield continued to work for insurance rate reductions with his newly formed public interest group. After researching the issue, Rosenfield believed insurance regulation was the only solution to rising rates. In response, Rosenfield drafted new insurance reform legislation, which insurance industry lobbyists killed in the state capitol. =Proposition 103= In 1987, Rosenfield began to write a ballot box proposal and formed a campaign to sponsor it called Voter Revolt. The proposal turned into insurance reform Proposition 103 and promised voters a minimum 20% rollback in rates for property, auto and other kinds of insurance. It also required insurance companies to follow the state's consumer protection and civil rights laws. Voter Revolt operated on a $2.9 million budget, a fraction of the insurance industry's $63 million lobbying and advertising effort. The insurance industry, fearing they would not be able to defeat Proposition 103, launched three competing initiative measures in an attempt to confuse voters. To bring attention to his cause, Rosenfield used grassroots publicity stunts like having guards accompany him while he delivered the signatures that put Proposition 103 on the ballot. As well, he attempted to deliver truckloads of cow manure to the headquarters Farmers Insurance of Los Angeles.Muir, p3 Rosenfield often referred to insurance companies as \\"outlaws\\" during the campaign. These stunts, many 18-hour days, canvassers knocking on 1 million doors, and the high-profile endorsement of his mentor, Ralph Nader, helped Voter Revolt pass the initiative in November 1988. The win was seen as a huge blow to the insurance industry. After Proposition 103 passed, Rosenfield told the Wall Street Journal that he gotten inquiries from public interest groups \\"in at least 30 other states expressing interest in launching Proposition 103-style initiatives.\\"Wells, p1Muir, p2 Since then, Rosenfield, and his colleagues at Consumer Watchdog defended Proposition 103 from insurance industry attacks and ensured the proposition's implementation. In 2008, the Consumer Federation for America estimated that Proposition 103 had saved consumers over $63 billion since 1988. That organization updated its estimate in 2013, concluding that Proposition 103 had saved California motorists over $100 billion, an average annual savings of $345 per household, $8,625 per family. Using insurance industry data, CFA found that \\"between 1989 and 2010, auto insurance premiums actually dropped by 0.3%, while they rose 43.3% nationally during that period. California was the only state in the nation where prices dropped over the 22 year period.\\" Rosenfield opposed Proposition 17, a $16 million attempt by Mercury Insurance Group to repeal a key provision of Proposition 103 in 2010; it was defeated. The company spent another $17 million on a very similar initiative in 2012; it too was defeated. In 2012, an initiative to control health insurance costs similarly to Prop 103 received over 800,000 signatures and earned a place on the 2014 ballot. =Health Care Reform and HMO patients' rights= In 1994, during the Clinton healthcare debate, Rosenfield began working to reform the HMO industry. He and his colleague Jamie Court created Californians for Quality Care (a division of Consumer Watchdog) to spearhead the effort. In 1996, the group worked to have the nation's first \\"patients' bill of rights\\" proposition placed on the California ballot. However, Proposition 216 failed to pass, garnering only 38.7% of the vote.http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_216_(1996) In 1998, the group proposed additional HMO patient's rights legislation.Los Angeles Business Journal, p1 To bring attention to the issue, the group dumped a truck load of pinto beans at an HMO industry conference to emphasize Consumer Watchdog's opposition to HMO \\"bean counters\\" overriding doctors' decisions.Benson, p1 Most of the legislative package later passed with the help of the California Nurses Association in November 1998. As a result, California has the strongest HMO patient protection laws in America. Many of the provisions of California's bill were included in the national U.S. Patients' Bill of Rights act, which passed Congress in 2001. In the 2000s, Consumer Watchdog worked to extend Proposition 103's rate protections to health insurance. After the California Legislature repeatedly rejected the legislation, the organization placed the proposal on the November 2014 ballot. =Energy Regulation= Rosenfield co-authored Proposition 9 in 1998, a ballot initiative to block aspects of the utility deregulation laws passed by California lawmakers in 1996. Proposition 9 failed due to the $40 million lobbying efforts of the utility industry. Rosenfield claimed his re-regulation efforts could have helped deter the California Energy Crisis exploited by Enron and other energy companies in 2001. Rosenfield talks about the situation in the 2005 documentary, The Smartest Guys in the Room. =Litigation= Rosenfield is a lawyer in consumer protection lawsuits brought by Consumer Watchdog's legal team challenging abusive practices by companies in the insurance, health care, automobile, cell phone, and satellite television industries, as well as government agencies that violate laws. He also works with Consumer Watchdog in administrative and judicial proceedings to lower insurance rates and enforce Proposition 103. Consumer Education Foundation Rosenfield serves as President of the Consumer Education Foundation. The group maintains \\"Where's Our Money?,\\" a website that discusses the financial crisis of 2008. Works Rosenfield wrote Silent Violence, Silent Death: The Hidden Epidemic of Medical Malpractice in 1994. The book was published by Essential Books and outlines the extent of the medical malpractice in the United States, and how consumers can protect themselves.http://essential- book.org/books/silent/ He has written multiple newspaper articles http://www.harveyrosenfield.com/index.php?page=Documents and testified before Congress and many state legislatures on consumer protection.

After being forced out of Black Oak Books, he went to work for KPFA Radio, the first listener- sponsored FM radio in the U.S. For over twenty years he produced public events for KPFA. As a poster artist he created original posters for these events, a number of which are in the collection of Oakland Museum of California. He is also a painter and maker of fine art prints and broadsides. In The 26th of July Movement, Cuba After graduation from Sewickley High School, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Baldock studied for two years at Ohio University in Athens, (1955–57), receiving military training in the Army ROTC program, which proved significant when Baldock became a combatant in the 26th of July Movement insurgency against Fulgencio Batista led by Fidel Castro in Cuba. He became aware of the Cuban Revolution seeing movie newsreels in Akron, where he was working at a B.F. Goodrich rubber plant in the fall of 1957. He went on to work at the New York Herald Tribune as a copyboy; there he had privileged access to ticker-tape coverage of the Cuban insurrectionary movement as well as to maps and press passes. With a college friend who knew Spanish he made his way to Havana in the spring of 1958. From Havana the two made their way to the Sierra Maestra, where they became part of Fidel Castro’s group of rebel combatants,Photo: Baldock with Castro https://www.flickr.com/photos/54390584@N03/5036744657/“Former Castro Follower Now Insurance Man,” Columbus Citizen, byline Bill Gold, Columbus, Ohio, c. late 1959.“Los Baldock: una imagen en dos tiempos,” Juventud Rebelde, 16 February 1992.

Baldock remained in this group for five months until becoming ill with bacillary dysentery. Baldock and his friend were then moved covertly out of the country through an underground network consisting primarily of small Catholic churches. In Miami, hospitalized, he met with a United Press representative to whom he gave the two notebooks of his observations and interviews, consenting for them to be used as needed by UP.

His ancestral name was Ji, given name Zhoupu (州蒲), though Shiji records his given name as Shouman (壽曼), and Duke Li was his posthumous title. Duke Li succeeded his father, Duke Jing of Jin, who abdicated after falling ill in summer 581 BC. Duke Jing died a month later. Battle of Masui In 580 BC, the first year of his reign, Duke Li made an alliance with Duke Huan of the State of Qin. The alliance did not last, however, as Jin attacked Qin two years later and defeated Qin at Masui (麻隧). Battle of Yanling Duke Li fought and won one of the most significant battles of the Spring and Autumn period, the Battle of Yanling, against Jin's archrival, the State of Chu. In 577 BC, the Jin vassal state Zheng attacked the Chu vassal state Xu (許). The next year Chu attacked Zheng in revenge, and forced Zheng to switch its loyalty to Chu. Zheng then attacked Song, another Jin vassal state. In 575 BC, Duke Li raised an army to attack Zheng, while King Gong of Chu led the Chu army north to defend his new ally. The two forces met at Yanling, and Jin defeated Chu by attacking its weaker flanks manned by the poorly trained Zheng and Dongyi soldiers. During the battle King Gong was shot in the eye by an arrow. Despite his wound, at the end of the day King Gong summoned the chief military commander Zifan to discuss the battle plan for the next day, but caught Zifan drunk. King Gong decided to retreat and Zifan later committed suicide. Chapter XVI. Struggle against the clans Although Jin regained its status as the leader of the Spring and Autumn states by defeating Chu, it would soon be riven by internal strife that would eventually lead to its partition into the new states of Han, Zhao, and Wei. During the reign of Duke Li the Xi (郤) clan, led by Xi Qi (郤錡), Xi Chou (郤犨), and Xi Zhi (郤至) – together called the three Xis – was one of the most powerful clans that dominated Jin politics. In 573 BC Duke Li struck the Xi clan and killed the three Xis. However, two other clans, the Luan (欒氏) led by Luan Shu (欒書), and the Zhonghang (中行氏) led by Zhonghang Yan (中行偃), staged a coup d'etat and imprisoned Duke Li. The Luan and Zhonghang clans installed Zhou, a prince from a cadet branch of the ruling House of Ji, on the Jin throne. Zhou would later be known as Duke Dao of Jin. Duke Li was killed soon afterwards.

Its remains have been found associated with cultural sites on Lifuka, four other islands in the Haʻapai group, and Tongatapu. It was consumed by the early Tongans and probably became extinct within a century of human colonization of the archipelago 2800 years ago. The four extant members of Brachylophus are much smaller, and are found in nearby Fiji. B. fasciatus is now present on Tonga as well, but was probably brought there from Fiji by humans about 800 years ago. B. gibbonsi is estimated to have been about 1.8 times the length of its living relatives. An even larger Fijian iguana of the genus Lapitiguana was also formerly present, and also became extinct shortly after the arrival of humans. The genus Brachylophus is thought to have reached the South Pacific by rafting on the South Equatorial Current 9000 km westward from the Americas, where their closest extant relatives remain. Another theory is that the South Pacific iguanas descend from a more widespread lineage of (now extinct) Old World iguanids that diverged from their New World relatives in the Paleogene, migrated to either Australia or Southeast Asia, and then somehow made their way to the Fijian and Tongan archipelagos.

House identifies as belonging to the Ngambri-Ngunnawal family group (also referred to as Ngambri- Ngunnuwal family group), which has been formally recognised by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government as having historical connections to the Canberra region and surrounds, particularly the region around Namadgi National Park.Matilda House, ‘Kymin and Kangaroo: a Ngambri love story’, Book 4, Tales from Ngambri History, ACT Department of Education, Youth and Family Services: Tuggeranong, ACT, 2003 Black Harry Williams, also known as Ngoobra, House’s great-grandfather, and Harry Williams her grandfather, both identified as Ngambri. There remains a dispute over who 'rights to country' belong to in the ACT, with the ACT Government issuing formal protocols regarding recognition of the traditional owners of the land on which Canberra is located, in response to a request from the United Ngunnawal Elders Council. House returned to Canberra in 1963 and has been actively involved in Indigenous Affairs in the Canberra region since 1967. House is the Chair of the Ngambri Local Aboriginal Land Council in Queanbeyan, NSW, which she established with her brothers in 1984, and the Joint Chair of the Interim Namadgi National Park Committee.

Early life Speight was born in Stockton-on-Tees, Durham, England in 1867. When he was about 12, his family emigrated to New Zealand. His father, a strong disciplinarian, was a teacher at the school at Tai Tapu, which is a rural village some south of the Christchurch suburb of Halswell. Robert Speight gained a scholarship at Christchurch Boys' High School and it is said that his daily travels along the foot of the Port Hills, an extinct shield volcano, raised his interest in volcanology. His father transferred to St. Albans School and the family moved to Christchurch, and Speight continued his education at Canterbury College. He graduated in 1888 with a Bachelor of Arts, and in 1889 with a Master of Arts with first class honours in mathematics. Professional career Speight took a teaching position at his secondary school and studied science part-time under Frederick Hutton, graduating in 1891 with a Bachelor of Science. When Hutton retired his teaching position from Canterbury College in 1903, Speight succeeded him as a lecturer, while retaining his teaching position at Boys' High for some more years. Speight was appointed assistant curator of Canterbury Museum in 1911, and was full director from March 1914 to November 1935. During his career, Speight published 130 papers and reports, which span a wide area of earth science. Geographically, he mostly published Canterbury topics, but also the Kermadec Islands and the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands (which he visited in 1907). His papers on past worldwide climate changes and their causes gained him international attention, and he was elected to fellowships of the Geological Society of America and the Geological Society of London. He was also a fellow of the New Zealand Institute, and was the organisation's president from 1933 for two years and during that time, the name was changed to Royal Society of New Zealand in reference to the Royal Society based in London. The New Zealand Institute awarded Speight the Hector Memorial Medal in 1921, at the time its highest award. He was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935. Family and death On 4 January 1899, he married Ruth Mary Seager at St Michael's Church in central Christchurch. His wife was the sister of Rose Elizabeth Seager, the mother of the writer Ngaio Marsh. Ruth and Robert Speight's three children all went to live overseas, so after his wife died in 1941 his life was lonely. He died at St George's Hospital on 8 September 1949, aged 81.

Early life Veresaev was born in Tula, where his father was a doctor. After graduating from the Tula gymnasium in 1884, he attended Saint Petersburg University, taking a master's degree in history in 1888. He then enrolled in University of Dorpat/Yuryev and successfully completed a course in medicine. His first work to appear in print was a collection of poems in 1885. His first short story, The Puzzle, was published in 1887. In 1890 he toured the coal mines of Donetsk with his brother, gathering material for a collection of sketches called The Underground Kingdom, detailing the struggles and hardships of the exploited miners, which he published in 1892. Career During the 1890s, Veresaev joined a group known as the Legal Marxists, and he published works in such journals as New Word, Inception and Life. During this period he wrote a cycle of works concerning the intelligentsia’s frame of mind at the turn of the 20th century, including the novella Without a Road (1895), the short story The Craze (1898) and the novella At the Turning Point (1902). He also wrote about the difficult position of the Russian peasantry, such as in the short story Lizar (1899) which was praised by Vladimir Lenin. His short story On a Dead- end Road (1896) and the novella Two Ends (1899–1903) were devoted to the life of the workers. During the first decade of the 20th century Veresaev was a member of the Sreda (Wednesday) literary group and published his works in Maxim Gorky's Znanie collections. He published his most successful book, the semi-autobiographical Memoirs of a Physician in 1901, in which he sharply criticized the system of Russian medical education. In April 1901 he was dismissed from the hospital where he'd been working because of his political views, and was forbidden to live in Moscow or Saint Petersburg for a period of two years. In 1904, at the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, he joined the army as a doctor. He told of his experiences in his book In the War, published in 1906. In this work he showed the heroism of Russian soldiers and officers and, at the same time, the corruption of the tsarist army. Veresaev also wrote a long critical and philosophical work entitled Vital Life, the first book of which (1910) was devoted to a comparative analysis of Fyodor Dostoevsky (Man Accursed) and Leo Tolstoy (Long Live the Whole World!); the second book, Apollo and Dionysius (1915), was a critique of Friedrich Nietzsche's views. In 1911 Veresaev established the Pisately v Moskve Publishing House which he headed until 1918. Later life After the 1917 Revolution, which he welcomed, he devoted much of his time to cultural development and education. He also completed his cycle of works about the intelligentsia, including the novels In a Blind Alley (1922- translated into English as The Deadlock) and The Sisters (1933). He published his reminiscences In the Years of My Youth in 1927 and In My Student Years in 1929. He also translated works by ancient Greek and Roman authors, including Homer’s Hymns, Sappho, Archilochus and others. At the end of the 1930s he began to translate the Iliad (published in 1949) and the Odyssey (published in 1953). For his outstanding achievements in the field of literature Veresaev was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1945. He was also awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. He died in Moscow in June 1945.

Balachandran from a story by Cheriyan Kalpakavadi. It stars Mohanlal, Shobana and Amala. The film, produced by Suresh Balaje features a soundtrack composed by Ouseppachan. The plot follows a psychiatrist, Dr. Sunny (Mohanlal) and one of his patients, Reshma (Amala), who gets obsessed with him romantically, but Sunny is already engaged with Annie (Shobana). The film explores the phenomenon of transference. Upon release, it received critical acclaim and was also a commercial success at the box office. Ulladakkam is now regarded as one of the best films of Kamal. The film won three Kerala State Film Awards, including Best Actor (Mohanlal), Best Director, and Best Dubbing Artist (Bhagyalakshmi). Amala won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Malayalam. Plot Dr Sunny is a psychiatrist who is engaged to his girlfriend Annie. One day a girl named Reshma is admitted to Sunny's hospital by her brother Roy, who is a close friend of Sunny. Sunny is led to Reshma’s room, where he catches a glimpse of the trashed-out room, with Reshma crouching in a corner, in a highly agitated state. She is later brought to the hospital, and we see her less agitated, but with a vacant expression, suggestive of a dissociation from her surroundings. While she is managed with tranquilizers, Sunny probes into her background. He discovers a few clues in her diary. There are traits of heightened emotionality in her writings- letters to her mother who passed away when she was ten. Her brother adds that she had a transient psychotic episode when their mother had passed away. Sunny tries to explore the trigger for the current psychotic episode. From the placards he shows her, he gathers that there is a connection with the sea, for Reshma becomes highly agitated when she sees a placard depicting the sea. With further clues, he associates it to the mysterious disappearance of her boyfriend, Arun. He subjects Reshma to hypnosis and elicits the whole story of how a mafia group closes in on the duo at the beach, and kill Arun, whose body is washed into the sea, while Reshma watches helplessly.Reshma is made to narrate the event and she is also given a guarded exposure to the sea, which cures her of her sea phobia. And thus, we see Reshma gradually recovering from her dissociation. She focusses on her surroundings and develops a special bonding with one of the inmates (Sukumari), in whom she sees a mother figure. Her recovery is complicated by her fundamental emotional insecurity and dependent personality. When Sukumari is discharged from the asylum, Reshma’s unconscious seeks a strong replacement for Arun and she clings to Sunny. Sunny’s personality and his degree of involvement with Reshma makes it easy for her to transfer her emotions for Arun towards Sunny. With an unconscious that refuses to come to terms with Arun’s permanent loss, and that refuses to acknowledge the loss of a relationship in which Reshma’s involvement was overt (with dependence), Reshma’s unconscious tranfers the relationship to the receptive and reciprocative Sunny (the phenomenon of transference, described by Freud). And thus, her dependence shifts to Sunny. The movie takes a final turn when at Sunny’s wedding party, Reshma finds herself disturbed by the sound of the drums and the sight of the drummer (Arun was a drummer). In a fit of psychosis, Reshma murders Sunny’s wife, Annie. This also goes on to highlight that while the conscious stores the event largely in the form of verbal memory, the unconscious stores a memory as an assortment of multiple perceptions (visual/auditory/tactile/olfactory), each associated with a certain stimulus. All these are eventually integrated to form the final memory which is then fed to the conscious for processing. My outlook on this second bout of psychosis is that though Reshma is cured of her phobia with regard to the traumatic event she witnessed, she has not come to acceptance of Arun’s loss. Her mind continues to resist this fact, and any stimulus which is a reminder of Arun’s loss, sets off the psychosis. The psychiatrist has addressed her PTSD, but not the underlying insecurity and dependence that is part of her personality.

Mouse. Major characters =Mouse Fitzgerald= Voice and guitar by Matt Maiellaro Also known as \\"Fitz\\", Mouse Fitzgerald is an alcoholic, amnesiac, anthropomorphic green mouse who struggles to survive and understand the world in which he is trapped. Fitz seldom answers a question directly and often relies on circumlocution, non sequiturs, or insults to evade a clear response. He and his \\"only friend\\" Skillet drive around town in a yellow jet fighter taxi, commit crimes, stage gun fights, and play rock music. An accomplished Metal guitarist (can play both right-hander and left- hander guitars as seen in \\"Spider\\"), he is often at odds with Skillet's timing on the drums. He also likes to sing (somewhat badly) and does it in many episodes. Fitz displays sociopathic tendencies and disobeys authority. Fitz becomes increasingly suspicious of Shark, Liquor, Roostre, Rhoda and others, whom he suspects may know about his \\"erased\\" past. His actions later in the series are centered around discovering the nature of his world and fighting against Shark, Rectangular Businessman, and their minions. In a flashback at the beginning of \\"Rooster\\", Fitz's height and weight are listed on his identification card as \\"109\\" and he has been linked to \\"Q109\\", a cryptic word which is mentioned several times in connection to Fitz and Roostre's past. \\"Q109\\" is the SUMMA THEOLGIAE. In \\"Prolegomenon\\", Fitz is revealed to retain his mouse form in the \\"real world\\" reality, whereas Shark and RBM and various other characters do not and have real human counterparts. Appears in all episodes. In the real world, Mouse is voiced by Baron Victor von Hamburger IV, where he appears in the half-hour special \\"Invictus.\\" =Shark= Voiced by Adam Reed (seasons 1, 2, and \\"Invictus\\"), Ned Hastings (season 3) Shark runs an employment agency and periodically hires Fitz to do various odd jobs. By his own account, Shark loves Fitz in both a platonic and homoerotic sense. He's \\"Come to care about [him]. A lot. And also not in that way. Well, yeah, in that way a little. Half and half.\\" Shark's relationship with Fitz is complicated by the fact that they have literally tried to kill one another on more than one occasion. Shark is feared by many characters; in episode 4 \\"Spider,\\" he intimidates Rhoda, and Golden Joe teleports into the room briefly only to see Shark and flee. Shark commands a wall-crawling bug that he uses to plant surveillance cameras. From his control center, Shark seems to have every location in the town under his surveillance. He can detonate many buildings in the town with the simple press of a button. In the first episode, he is shown to be bulletproof. Shark works closely with Rectangular Businessman, against whom he is constantly butting heads and struggling for power. Their arguments never lead anywhere, and they continue to be \\"friends\\" despite these disagreements. Shark also works with the sentient, teleporting Clock though the nature of their relationship is unclear. In episode 19 \\"Farewell,\\" Shark is gunned down by Fitz, Skillet, and the cyborg Green Sweater Girl. Despite Shark having been bulletproof, this lethal barrage causes Shark's head to explode. In the episode \\"Meat Warrior,\\" Shark and Rectangular Businessman talk about choosing to take the forms of a shark and a rectangular wafer. In episode 20 \\"Prolegomenon,\\" Shark's voice is heard coming from a purple-colored man in a business suit. His dialog suggests that the \\"shark\\" had been his representation in Fitz's virtual reality. Though it is unknown why he chose the shape, he claims, \\"I have my reasons for choosing the Shark.\\" He is killed in the \\"real world\\" by a nurse who resembles the Green Sweater Girl and a man who resembles Peanut Cop. Shark appears in all episodes from the first two seasons, except \\"Auraphull\\". The original animation, however, is believed to be from the Sealab 2020 episode \\"The Shark Lover\\"; the still appears (briefly) in a Season One episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, \\"Escape from Leprauchpolis\\", and was first seen in the 7th-season premiere of Space Ghost Coast to Coast, \\"Kentucky Nightmare\\" (5/7/2001), as Ol' Kentucky Shark. =Skillet= Skillet never speaks, but he makes a high pitched screeching noise while jumping rapidly. He looks like a black and white scan of a chinchilla illustration, and his adultswim.com profile refers to him as one, but everyone in the 12 oz. Mouse universe refers to him as \\"skillet\\" Almost the exact scan used for Skillet Skillet is Fitz's closest associate. Skillet owns an AK-47 assault rifle+ an usg-50 sniper rifle and is seen using it on several occasions. Skillet has the ability to fly, and when he does flames shoot out of his feet. He can fire lasers from his eyes. Skillet is an accomplished drum player and can use his prehensile tail to play with three drumsticks. He has been in jail, or otherwise held against his will a few times. In the second episode his prison ankle bracelet exploded, seemingly killing him, but he returned alive and well in episode three with no explanation. Skillet is apparently killed at the end of episode 19 when Rectangular Businessman blows up the gun turret he is manning. However, Skillet returns in episode 20. He is revealed to be in a liquid-filled tube in the \\"real world,\\" recovering from what seems to be burns. He, along with Fitz, retains his rodent form in this reality, whereas other characters, like Shark and RBM do not retain their own forms. A concerned viewer asked in a B&W; bump why Skillet appears to be the best-drawn character in the show. The bump's response was that Skillet was \\"ganked from an old clip-art book\\" and is one of only two characters Matt didn't draw himself, Shark being the other. Skillet appears in each episode, as well as on a piece of blotter paper in Perfect Hair Forever =Rectangular Businessman= Voiced by Kurt Soccolich The Rectangular Businessman, also known as No-Eyed Square Guy, is an arrogant pink male square (though he refers to himself as a woman in episode 3) who claims to be an affluent businessman and continually references his enormous wealth. He wears glasses but has no eyes. In episode 1, the Rectangular Businessman asked Shark to provide him with transportation. His request was granted in the form of Fitz, who was charged with flying him to an important meeting. Instead, in keeping with his usual mode of operation, Fitz took the rectangle to a motel room where he forced him to star in his first amateur porn film. Fitz and Skillet then tossed a bomb onto the bed and fled as the motel exploded. Rectangular reappeared not long afterward, this time in league with Shark against Fitz. Although partners, there seems to be a rivalry between Shark and the Rectangular Businessman, both imposing on the other on several occasions. Despite his arrogance, Rectangular has taken orders from Shark, albeit begrudgingly. Shark revealed in \\"Meat Warrior\\" that they used to get along, but is not sure what happened to their friendship. In episode 19 \\"Farewell,\\" after Shark's death, Rectangular Businessman claims that \\"Shark was just a pawn.\\" The Rectangular Businessman is able to use his mind to kill, and has used it for a number of activities, from teleporting a television to splitting open heads to transforming the Shadowy Figure into a dark liquid substance. The Rectangular Businessman is apparently killed at the end of episode 19 when his bank/home/flying ship is destroyed by Amalokch. In episode 20, Rectangular Businessman's voice can be heard emanating from a short, pink- colored human in a business suit, similar to the human who corresponds to Shark. In this \\"real world\\" scene, the man displays the same kind of telekinetic power Rectangular Businessman had shown, stopping a bullet with his mind. He is, however, shot in the back of the head by a man who resembles Peanut Cop, and dies in that reality as well. Appears in: \\"Hired\\", \\"Roostre\\", \\"Rememorized\\", \\"Spharktasm\\", \\"Adventure Mouse,\\" \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Surgery Circus\\", \\"Booger Haze\\", \\"Star Wars VII\\", \\"Enjoy the Arm\\", \\"Meat Warrior\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", \\"Corndog Chronicles\\", \\"Eighteen\\", \\"Farewell\\", \\"Prolegomenon\\", and \\"Invictus\\". =Rhoda= Voiced by Dave Willis Rhoda the bartender has only one eye and serves Fitz his drinks. Fitz's usual order is twelve beers (at once). Rhoda appears to be a friend to Fitz, but is terrified and intimidated by Shark. Rhoda also believes that Rectangle and Roostre are the true evils in their society. Characters alternate referring to Rhoda using male and female pronouns, suggesting she may be a hermaphrodite, if not otherwise genderless, or, alternatively, may be two separate characters with the same name. A segment of the screenplay from Perfect Hair Forever appears on Rhoda's body, implying the character originated as a doodle. Fitz finds him/her dead and shot full of arrows at the end of episode 5 \\"Rememorized\\". At the start of episode 6 \\"Spharktasm\\", Rhoda walked in and suspiciously told Fitz that the dead body was a metal dummy, and it was just a joke. Rhoda is forced to spill information to Fitz at gunpoint, before agreeing to help him in exchange for being kept out of his affairs further, but in episode 7 \\"Adventure Mouse\\", Shark contacts Rhoda and implies he knows everything about his/her meeting with Fitz. Rectangular Businessman cuts Rhoda in half with a telekinetic attack, and his/her innards spill out. A fire-breathing serpent emerges from the entrails and slithers away. Appears in: \\"Hired\\", \\"Signals\\", \\"Spider\\", \\"Rememorized\\", \\"Spharktasm\\", \\"Adventure Mouse\\", \\"invictus\\" (Cameo), \\"First 12\\" & \\"Awaken\\". =Man/Woman= Voiced by Bonnie Rosmarin Man/Woman sometimes appears, lays horizontally and turns upright to make a loud air horn sound. She works at the diner, where she serves plates of food on fire. He/she first appeared in \\"Hired\\" when Fitz tried to make out on her at a bar. She has the unusual ability to transform into a man after shouting \\"Man Power Go!\\", and can transform back into a woman with \\"Woman Power On!\\" Fumes from turkeys can incapacitate her, apparently by causing her to alternate between man and woman forms uncontrollably. The air horn sound first appears in episode 2 \\"Signals\\". In episode 3 \\"Roostre\\", Rectangular Businessman asks Shark if he got his signals and a brief scene of Man/Woman emitting the air horn noise is shown. His reasons for using him/her remain unknown. She is shown in \\"Bowtime\\" in front of the door to the chamber where Fitz is being kept. In \\"Surgery Circus\\" she enters a building which then explodes. His/her only subsequent appearance is in episode 15 \\"Meaty Dreamy\\". In a scene set in an indeterminate time and place, Shark appears in the moon and tells Man/Woman to eat a flower that he/she had been admiring. A snake (which may or may not be the one inhabiting Rhoda's body) also appears, and breathes fire. Appears in: \\"Hired\\", \\"Signals\\", \\"Roostre\\", \\"Rememorized\\", \\"Spharktasm\\", \\"Adventure Mouse,\\" \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Surgery Circus\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", and \\"Invictus\\". =Peanut Cop= Voiced by Nick Weidenfeld Also referred to as \\"Peanut\\" (and simply \\"The Cop\\" in episode summaries), Peanut Cop is a blue peanut-shaped policeman who fails to do his job, since he is constantly stoned and/or drunk. His state of mind prevents him from reacting appropriately to crimes that occur right in front him. For example, when Producer Guy's head is sliced in half and blood spews out, Peanut Cop reacts by asking, \\"Is that ice cream?\\" Sometimes he begins to laugh uncontrollably, and anyone around him begins to laugh as well. According to the Rectangular Businessman he is \\"the highest marksman in the class,\\" and \\"could probably hit a mite from 1000 yards in high wind\\". Despite this claim, Peanut Cop is usually unable to hit anything unless he is within a few inches of his intended target. In \\"Auraphull\\", Peanut Cop changes his profession to a firefighter after stealing a firefighter helmet, blowing up the hat store, and stealing a jet-powered fire truck with skis. He is later captured by the Shadowy Figure, but the tranquilizer darts do not knock him unconscious (he likes them because they only get him even more stoned). In episode 18 \\"Pre- Reckoning\\", after apparently suffering some sort of fit or seizure, he says in an uncharacteristically serious voice \\"No one controls me.\\" He joins Fitz in fighting the Tie Bots. He later reveals that he knows the purpose of Tie Bots and the Hovervacs and where the asprind is located. His profession switches back to that of a policeman in the final episode, in which he reacquires his police hat. Like Shark and Rectangular Businessman, Peanut Cop has a human- looking persona, revealed in episode 20. In this incarnation he is a blue- colored man, and his glasses display the same star-shaped insignia seen on his original police hat. He is voice actor not present in the webisode. Appears in all episodes, \\"Hired\\", \\"Signals\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Spider\\", \\"Rememorized\\", \\"Spharktasm\\", \\"Adventure Mouse\\", \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Surgery Circus\\", \\"Booger Haze\\", \\"Enjoy the Arm\\", \\"Auraphull\\", \\"Meat Warrior\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", \\"Eighteen\\", \\"Pre-Reckoning\\", \\"Farewell\\", \\"Prolegomenon\\", \\"Enter The Sandmouse\\", and \\"Invictus\\". =Liquor= Voiced by Matt Harrigan Liquor runs the liquor store where Fitz frequently stops. His temperament can best be described as \\"resigned.\\" He seems to be Fitz's ally and is defiant to anyone of authority, such as Shark and Rectangular Businessman. Liquor seems to know about the secret nature of the world: in \\"Surgery Circus\\" he uses a button to freeze Shark's illusions, he reveals a duplicate of Eye that was hidden inside his store, and in \\"Eighteen\\" he discovers and communicates with the Hand while it's inside Producer Man's brain. He also knows about Roostre's connection with the Corn Droid and recognizes Muff. In \\"Spider\\", Liquor mistakenly receives a letter from Roostre's son, detailing his transformation into a mosquito named Mosquitor. Liquor is confused by the letter, commenting that he doesn't know who this person / mosquito is. In \\"Bowtime\\", he apparently has realized that the letter was for Roostre, whom he seems to have met before (although Roostre does not recognize him). He uses the letter to lure Roostre into the liquor store basement, where he traps him in Spider's web because, he claims, Roostre will \\"set the alarm\\" and \\"restart\\" everything. Appears in: \\"Hired\\", \\"Signals\\", \\"Spider\\", \\"Rememorized\\", \\"Spharktasm\\", \\"Adventure Mouse\\", \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Surgery Circus\\", \\"Booger Haze\\", \\"Enjoy the Arm\\", \\"Meat Warrior\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", \\"Corndog Chronicles\\", \\"Eighteen\\", \\"Pre-Reckoning\\", \\"Farewell\\", \\"invictus\\"(Cameo), \\"First 12\\" & \\"Awaken\\". =Producer Man= Voiced by Matt Thompson Producer Man is a loud, gregarious person who has a habit of walking around bent over backwards and constantly asks for high fives. He first approaches Fitz in episode 1 \\"Hired\\", in which he attempts to hire Fitz as an actor. He shows up later in \\"Spider\\", when he hears Fitz and Skillet's music and decides to give them a contract with his record label. He then gets into a discussion with the Policeman. Neither seems to understand what the other is talking about and are carrying on two completely different conversations. Producer Man's head is then sliced in half by an unseen force. Fitz still somehow produces his record, titled \\"F-Off.\\" Producer Man appears alive in \\"Bowtime\\" meeting with Shark and claiming that their plan was a success. His constant talking annoys Shark until he is once again killed in an unknown manner: He is off-screen when he suddenly stops talking, the sound of a buzzsaw is heard, and blood spreads across the floor. He appears alive again in \\"Meaty Dreamy\\" when his body is taken over by Roostre's hand. The hand is later cut out of his head leaving him possibly dead yet again. His name has been revealed only in a few of the official episode summaries from Adult Swim. Appears in: \\"Hired\\", \\"Spider,\\" \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", \\"Eighteen\\", \\"Pre- Reckoning\\" and \\"First 12\\". =Eye= Voiced by Nick Ingkatanuwat Eye is a giant eye who hires Fitz to kill Golden Joe, who owes him \\"fifty mil.\\" He speaks slowly and over-enunciates certain syllables. He often uses words that have a \\"long i\\" sound in them, even when they are not supposed to be pronounced with that sound (e.g. \\"mon-eye\\" instead of \\"money\\"). He lives on an island, which he claims is in either Iowa or Wyoming. Early in the series, he appears to be working with Shark, as he was called to a secret meeting with Shark, Rectangular Businessman and Man/Woman. In \\"Adventure Mouse\\", Eye got one of his legs cut off by the Hand after he offended Shark and Rectangle. Fitz appears to save him at the end of \\"Bowtime\\" In \\"Surgery Circus\\", Liquor opens a cabinet to reveal another eye that looks exactly the same as Eye, except for the missing leg. Liquor also repairs the injured Eye's leg. In \\"Enjoy the Arm\\", one of the Eyes sprouts an arm with a shotgun and leads the other Eye to Shark's control room, where he is held hostage with Golden Joe and the New Guy. While hostage, Eye says that he \\"misses his dad\\" and that he was coming to pick him up from school. Shark responds that he's been \\"here\\" so long, that his dad is long gone by now. In episode 20 \\"Prolegomenon\\", Eye's voice is heard coming from a human being who is connected to a large machine by tubes attached to his eye sockets and his left hand. In the beginning of the special \\"Invictus\\" eye was no longer a giant eyeball, he's a child and had a head with two large eyes, a red baseball cap, and a light blue torso that shaped like a square with arms and legs. Appears in: \\"Hired\\", \\"Signals\\", \\"Roostre\\", \\"Spider\\", \\"Adventure Mouse\\", \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Surgery Circus\\", \\"Booger Haze\\", \\"Enjoy the Arm\\", \\"Auraphull\\", \\"Meat Warrior\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", \\"Eighteen\\", \\"Pre-Reckoning\\", \\"Farewell\\", \\"Prolegomenon\\" and \\"Invictus\\"(Possibly) . =Golden Joe= Voiced by Vishal Roney Golden Joe is a loudmouthed (literally; all he does is shout) rapping wizard who has the ability to \\"come and go\\" as he pleases through teleportation. Shark refers to him as \\"All disappeary and shut.\\" Joe places a lot of importance on the ability to rhyme. His voice is distorted by a reverb effect and he has a single gold tooth that has a dollar sign on it. By his own account, he is an excellent driver. Golden Joe apparently has a penis roughly as large as the rest of his body, as shown when he and the Peanut Cop escaped from Fitz's plane by urinating against the windshield in \\"Bowtime\\". After \\"Adventure Mouse\\", Golden Joe remains allied with Fitz. He is later captured by Shark until Fitz and his friends free him in \\"Farewell\\". He remains with Fitz and Skillet until the opening webisode of the \\"third season\\", where he is abducted by a Hawk. Appears in: \\"Signals\\", \\"Spider\\", \\"Spharktasm\\", \\"Adventure Mouse\\", \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Surgery Circus\\", \\"Booger Haze\\", \\"Enjoy the Arm\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", \\"Eighteen\\", Pre-Reckoning\\", \\"Farewell\\", \\"Prolegomenon\\", \\"Enter The Sandmouse\\", and \\"Invictus\\". =Green-Sweatered Woman= Voiced by Melissa Warrensburg This character's actual name is unknown. She appears as a woman wearing a green blouse and shoes and a pink skirt. She speaks in an annoying, repetitive manner, often telling other characters what they're not allowed to do. This has resulted in her getting shot on at least two occasions. Rectangular Businessman rips her head in half for a similar reason, but she survives and walks away. She is revived as a cyborg by Fitz and Skillet in order to be their walking arsenal, carrying many firearms from Roostre's weapons cache. In cyborg form, she joins Fitz and Skillet in gunfights and helps to kill Shark. In the final episode, she appears in a different level of reality as a nurse. She and Peanut Cop seem to be allied in this reality with a mysterious being called the \\"New Angel\\", whom they contact after eliminating Shark and Square Guy's alternate forms in her reality. Appears in: \\"Signals\\", \\"Rememorized\\", \\"Adventure Mouse\\", \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Booger Haze\\", \\"Enjoy the Arm\\", \\"Meat Warrior\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", \\"Corndog Chronicles\\", \\"Eighteen\\", \\"Pre-Reckoning\\", \\"Farewell\\", \\"Prolegomenon\\", and \\"Invictus\\". =The New Guy= Voiced by Mike Lazzo The New Guy is a strange red umbrella with two sets of feet and a taste for lounge music. He appears periodically and makes a flapping noise. He also seems to have an obsession with Skillet as his house is covered with pictures of the chinchilla. He once kidnapped Skillet, bound and gagged him and hula hooped in front of him. He also saves Skillet from the Time Clock's gas in \\"Bowtime,\\" and travels with Fitz and Skillet for a short time. The New Guy often plays Princess Cruiser by Tongo Hiti on a record player. It seems to mesmerize or otherwise mentally incapacitate those who hear it. In episode 7 \\"Adventure Mouse\\", Roostre shouts \\"Nobody look at him! Get out of here before the song finishes!\\" In \\"Eighteen\\" the New Guy is captured by Shark and eaten. His song can still be heard emanating from Shark's belly. Later, a partially digested New Guy is pulled from Shark's headless corpse. He is last seen being carried on Eye's back to some place called \\"the river.\\" Appears in: \\"Signals\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Spider\\", \\"Spharktasm\\", \\"Adventure Mouse,\\" \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Surgery Circus\\", \\"Eighteen\\", \\"Farewell\\", and \\"Invictus\\". =Roostre= Voiced by Scott Luallen Roostre, pronounced \\"rooster,\\" is a corn dog farmer near the town where Fitz lives. He plays the guitar and has a hook for a hand. In episode 3 \\"Rooster\\", a divining corn dog leads Fitz and Skillet to Roostre's farm. Roostre speaks as though he is familiar with Fitz, referring to his preference for drinking twelve beers and mentions a mysterious \\"C. J. Muff\\" who left \\"Q109\\". Fitz does not show signs of recognition. In the episode \\"Spharktasm\\", Rhoda tells Fitz that Roostre is \\"the man\\" and claims he has all the answers. Later, Roostre sings a song which suggests that he had a normal life before becoming a corn dog farmer and losing his hand. He also relates a story of being abducted by an indistinct figure, taken to a white room, being paralyzed by a dart to the neck, and being pushed toward a \\"giant, spinning fan.\\" This bears a similarity to some of Fitz's dreams / memories, as well as what Peanut Cop later goes through. In episode 8 \\"Bowtime\\", Roostre is given a letter from Mosquitor, who claims to be his son, but Roostre can't seem to remember having a son. He is then captured by Liquor, who fears that Roostre may \\"restart everything\\" and \\"set the alarm.\\" Later, Roostre is abducted by Spider and taken to a desert cave. In the end of \\"Booger Haze\\", Roostre tells Spider, \\"Wait a minute. I know you,\\" in an uncharacteristically serious voice. After Fitz and Skillet discover and subsequently destroy a giant cache of firearms under Roostre's farm, Roostre convinces Spider to help him launch the Corn- Droid, a robot he has built which he claims can destroy everything. After having his Hand reattached, Roostre activates the Corn-Droid. In \\"Farewell\\", Liquor returns to the sewer from which the Corn-Droid was launched and finds Roostre lying motionless on the ground. A blue orb, who Liquor recognizes as \\"Muff\\", tells Liquor that Roostre has gone \\"up there.\\" The implications of this remain unexplained. Appears in: \\"Rooster\\", \\"Spharktasm\\", \\"Adventure Mouse\\", \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Surgery Circus\\", \\"Booger Haze\\", \\"Enjoy the Arm\\", \\"Meat Warrior\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", \\"Corndog Chronicles\\", \\"Pre-Reckoning\\", \\"Farewell\\", and \\"Invictus\\". =Pronto= Pronto, a short, crudely drawn man with no torso, is an agent employed by Shark and Rectangular Businessman. His weapon of choice is a bow and arrows, and he is an expert \\"archerist,\\" as Shark once called him. It is believed that he is the one responsible for the shootings of several characters, including a special effects expert and other random people in episode 2 \\"Signals\\" and Rhoda in episode 5 \\"Rememorized\\". In \\"Adventure Mouse\\" Rectangular Businessman commands Pronto (possibly telepathically), sending him to break into Fitz's house to get the Hand. At the end of \\"Bowtime,\\" Shark chastises him and sends him to deal with Fitz once and for all. Instead, he steals the 'Animal Chain' from Shark's control room and uses it to awaken Amalockh, in exchange for gold. Shortly thereafter, Amalockh devours both the Animal Chain and Pronto, and is thrown back up on fire in pieces in \\"Pre-Reckoning\\". Appears in: \\"Spider\\"(Taking a Shower), \\"Rememorized\\", \\"Spharktasm\\", \\"Adventure Mouse,\\" \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Meat Warrior\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", \\"Corndog Chronicles\\", \\"Eighteen\\", and \\"Pre-Reckoning\\". =Lady Mouse= Voiced by Liz Maiellaro In Fitz's dreams / flashbacks he seems to be married to an unnamed pink female mouse. In these flashbacks, they also have a yellow baby mouse. As his memories return, Fitz increasingly wants to find out what happened to his vanished family. In \\"Bowtime,\\" Shark and Rectangle use a hologram of her to attack Fitz. Their baby is said to be a girl as Fitz said\\" is she supposed to be that small. Appears in: \\"Rooster\\", \\"Spharktasm,\\" \\"Bowtime\\", \\"Invictus\\" =Birmingham / \\"C. J. Muff\\"= Voiced by George Lowe Not much is known about the mysterious Birmingham. He has been mentioned several times in the series, most notably in \\"Spharktasm\\", when Fitz questions Roostre about him. Roostre says that Birmingham is the guy he told Fitz about the night they got drunk (episode 103), and that he also goes by the name \\"C. J. Muff\\". He has supposedly quit something called Q109, which may be a secret organization that Fitz and Roostre worked in. In \\"Farewell,\\" Muff reveals himself to Liquor by leaving the spider's body and taking the form of a big ball of energy. This event was hinted at by the earlier Arachnid Xenomorphintation reference and also Roostre's observation to the Spider, \\"I know you.\\" He is concerned with stopping the asprind harvests, and sends Liquor to go find Fitz to achieve this. Muff's voice is first heard in \\"First 12\\", having returned to the radio station, Q109. =Clock/Industry Man= Voiced By Ned Hastings Clock is a wall clock that can slide around on the wall and teleport. It appears to command Shark and Rectangular Businessman, and can release \\"time gas\\" and \\"anti-language gas\\" that affect people's minds. While Shark and Rectangular Businessman converse with the Clock as if it were their equal or superior, the Clock itself does not speak. It only makes a constant ticking sound. The Clock hands are stopped; characters state that the time is stopped at 2:22. In Prolegomenon, the clock finally changes its time to 2:23. In Season 3, Clock is revealed to be Industry Man, the head of Shyd Industries. Industry Man is focused on finding the Box of Worlds so he can have control over all worlds. =Buzby= Voiced by Dana Snyder A bee who is an exterminator that Fitz hires when he finds Spider in his house back in the real world. Buzby chases Spider out with a chaingun, and then saves Fitz from being blown up by Shark. It is later revealed though that Buzby was working with Shark all along, wanting to bring Fitz back to the alternate dimension to free Shark and Rectangular Businessman. Appeared in \\"Invictus\\" =Aria= Voiced by Mary Spender A scientist working with Professor Wilx, she awakens Fitz in \\"First 12\\", and seeks his help in dicovering the Box of Worlds. =Professor Wilx= Voiced by Paul Painter Aria's boss, who might secretly be working against Fitz. Minor characters and creatures =Buttermilk= Buttermilk, one of many identical locals seen in 12 oz. Mouse, appears briefly during the \\"Adventure Mouse\\" episode. Buttermilk, along with a friend, were admiring his new car until Roostre and company arrive at the scene piloting Fitz's \\"Jet Taxi\\", violently crashing into them both. Buttermilk's new car was destroyed and both he and his friend were flash fried by the jet's flaming engines. =Bomb= Bomb is a minor character of 12 Oz Mouse. He was first used to blow up Rectangular Businessman in \\"Hired\\". Fitz used Bomb in \\"Signals\\" to distract Peanut Cop so Fitz could bust Skillet out of jail. Bomb also appears for a single frame in the opening theme. Bomb apperas for the final time in \\"Auraphull\\" when Peanut uses him to blow up the hats store. Appears in: \\"Hired\\", \\"Signals\\", and \\"Auraphull\\". =The Hand= In the end of episode 4 \\"Spider\\", Shark speaks of a record under Mouse's bed, which ends up being a severed hand. The episode ends with Shark's ominous command, \\"Spin it.\\" We find in \\"Spharktasm\\" that Fitz still has it (he mentions that it's in his icebox with the phone). In episode 7 \\"Adventure Mouse\\", the hand begins moving of its own accord. Shark and Rectangle have finally had enough of Eye, and Rectangle reveals a pair of bloody shears. Shark mentions the hand coming soon to use them, and we see Pronto breaking into Mouse's house and grabbing the Hand. Later, Eye is found hopping through the party with only one leg and a violently bleeding wound where the other used to be. The Hand is following him, holding the bloody shears. In the end of \\"Surgery Circus\\", the hand confronts Golden Joe and the Policeman in the liquor store. Liquor traps the Hand in a jar. Liquor tells Fitz that the Hand has been severed from Roostre, who needs it in order to use a palm panel to activate the Corn-Droid, as it will only recognize his right hand. The Hand is apparently chasing after Roostre, as Roostre mentions that it's his \\"homing hand.\\" Left unattended, the Hand breaks out of the jar and climbs into Producer Man's head. Soon thereafter, Liquor reattaches the Hand to Roostre. Appears in: \\"Spider\\", \\"Adventure Mouse\\", \\"Surgery Circus\\", \\"Booger Haze\\", \\"Enjoy the Arm,\\" \\"Meat Warrior\\", \\"Meaty Dreamy\\" =Amalockh= Amalockh is a many-armed monster that was summoned by Pronto using the Animal Chain, both of which he quickly devours. This character is animated with a notably higher level of detail than any other character on 12 oz. Mouse, having a design similar to some characters from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. In the episode \\"Corndog Chronicles\\", Amalockh was shown emerging from beneath a stone monument in a graveyard, atop which lie two turntables and a large skull. In later episodes, Amalockh uses the turntables to play music, to which he performs what Liquor says is the \\"break dance of death.\\" His other notable traits include the ability to grow to gigantic proportions and cause explosions by roaring. When asked by Fitz what Amalockh does, Liquor simply responded, \\"He kills us. He kills us all.\\" He also plucked a flower that grew in the graveyard. Shark says that this flower, if delivered to the right person, could result in dire consequences. =Footlong= Footlong is a flying robot corn dog that was built by Roostre. Footlong has the ability to fly with black stick wings and is built with radar. Footlong first appeared is episode 3, \\"Roostre\\". Skillet had a package and gave it to Fitz. Fitz opened up the package and found Footlong inside. Footlong started glowing very bright so Fitz and Skillet tracked down where Footlong came from. Fitz found out that Footlong came from Roostre's corn dog farm. Footlong then starts flying out of Fitz's hand and flew away with his black stick-like wings. Roostre then got missile command and fired a rocket at Footlong. In \\"Star Wars VII\\", a model of a prototype Footlong was shown in Roostre's basement. Appears in: \\"Roostre\\" and \\"Star Wars VII\\" =Bug= A small bug or group of identical bugs work for Shark, planting surveillance cameras. A bug will often spin around and walk on walls erratically, and bugs frequently procrastinate when given assignments. Shark has a low opinion of his bugs; when a bug offered to accompany Pronto on a mission, Shark denied him, saying that he'd screw it up \\"Because you're retarded.\\" =Spider= Spider is a man-sized spider that weaves a web in Fitz's house in episode 4 \\"Spider\\". He can also be seen walking through Shark's party in \\"Adventure Mouse\\" and in Liquor's basement in \\"Bowtime\\". In \\"Booger Haze\\" he takes Roostre to a cave and summons a swarm of musical notes that attack Roostre's farm. Roostre eventually recognizes Spider, telling him \\"I know you,\\" although his identity is never explicitly revealed. Later Spider travels with Roostre to the hidden location of the Corn-Droid. Here the Spider reveals himself to be C.J. Muff. =Hovervac= Hovervacs are a small, brown, flying goblin-like creatures first seen briefly during the \\"Adventure Mouse\\" episode. After Fitz, Skillet, and The New Guy leave Roostre's, the Hovervac is seen following them. It is later seen at Shark's party where it vacuums up two guests through a pair of tubes. In the episode \\"Eighteen\\", Shark commands Rectangular Businessman to summon thousands of Hovervacs from a giant fissure in the desert. Peanut Cop states that their main purpose is to harvest the asprind with their tubes, but they can also suck up people and objects. Hovervacs can also attack by firing red laser beams from their mouths. =The Black Beast= The beast is a strange creature with a monstrous face and snake-like body whose image appears throughout the series. Its actual name is unknown. An image of this creature first flashed on the screen when Fitz was talking about the movie Black Beast in episode 2 \\"Signals\\". It also flashed on the screen during Shark's meeting with Rectangle and Man/Woman in \\"Rooster\\" and during the transitions out of both of Fitz's flashbacks. It also appears for a few frames in the show's opening sequence and during a scene featuring the Black Beast theater marquee in the episode \\"Auraphull\\". The Black Beast's image also appears on the map of the town that Fitz and Skillet find. =Cold Phone= Fitz found the Cold Phone in his icebox, ringing with a rattle. When Fitz questioned Rhoda about it, in episode 6 \\"Spharktasm\\", Rhoda replied, \\"You don't EVER want to get one... not ever!\\". Shark first directed Fitz to find the Cold Phone in his icebox during a phone conversation. =Tiebot= A Tiebot first appeared as a large, red and white bow tie in a dream sequence in \\"Spharktasm,\\" when Fitz's wife intended to give him the tie as a birthday gift. However, it was stolen by the Dark Figure. In \\"Bowtime\\" Fitz is in an illusion room in Shark's house, where his wife again tries to give him a bow tie, but it transforms into a four-legged robot with claws, miniature guns and a drill, a \\"Tiebot\\". In \\"Eighteen\\" Shark commands the Rectangular Businessman to activate thousands of the Tiebots, which begin killing the townspeople. Some Tiebots are configured to fly, and Peanut Cop says their primary function is to shoot things with their lasers. =The Shadowy Figure= The Shadowy Figure first appears in Fitz's flashbacks. He is shown presumably abducting characters, after shooting them with tranquilizer darts. Fitz encounters him and is shot with a dart. Roostre also mentions a \\"dark figure, whose features I couldn't make out\\" in \\"Spharktasm\\", and says that this figure drugged him, placed him in a white room, and pushed him towards a fan. The Shadowy Figure later appears when the Peanut Cop is abducted in a similar way, and put in what appears to be the same room. The Shadowy Figure is seen secretly speaking with Liquor, and in \\"Farewell\\" it is revealed that the Shadowy Figure had been allied with Rectangular Businessman. However, the Shadowy Figure only speaks in an unintelligible, garbled voice, so it is not clear what his true motivations are. In \\"Meaty Dreamy\\", a dream suggests that the Shadowy Figure has a strange connection with Rectangular Businessman, and seems to show Rectangular Businessman transforming into a circle. However, in \\"Farewell\\", Rectangular Businessman turns the Shadowy Figure into liquid and traps him in a bottle. Shadowy Figure appears in the last scene of episode 20, when his bottle shatters on the ground, and he escapes in liquid form. =Archeus= Archeus is a glowing ball of energy that appears to Fitz in the final episode \\"Prolegomenon\\". While visually similar to a combination of Muff and the musical notes from \\"Booger Haze\\", Archeus is apparently a separate entity. Archeus restores the town to new and tells Fitz that he will only understand things if he gives up the fight for \\"everything.\\" She also reminds Fitz that his wife, his child, and Skillet still need his help, which Fitz refuses to believe. Archeus communicates to Fitz through the sound of a piano playing, which is translated for the audience via subtitles. Fitz may be the only character who can sense Archeus. However, Shark and the Rectangular Businessman seem to be aware of its existence and find Archeus to be an annoyance. =Lee= In 'Enter the Sandmouse' a character appears named Lee she wants aid from Mouse and Skillet after her gunfight with them. She talks about people who find the New Angel and \\"get out\\". That night she gave Mouse the only thing that could kill her (apparently a large silver bullet), then turned into a she-wolf. =Kiki= Voiced by Stephanie Lennox Golden Joe's DJ. After Golden Joe vanishes, she sets out to find him, eventually finding a jet ski that she later uses to (by complete accident) kill Professor Wilx. See also * 12 oz. Mouse * List of 12 oz.

The legendary tree belongs to the genus Ceiba, of the species pentandra, and the family Bombacaceae. The word Ceiba comes from a Taino word pronounced say-bah.

On 18 July 2011, however, the tree lost another large limb. After this event, only 35% of the remaining tree was estimated to still be alive. =Characteristics= The fruit of the Ceiba tree contains a fiber that is eight time lighter than cotton and five times more buoyant than cork. As such it was used as the flotation for early life preservers. In addition to these attributes, the fiber fully repels water, has a low thermal conductivity and is resistant to rot. A little known fact is that before synthetics were used for insulation materials, mattresses and pillows, these were stuffed with the fiber of the Ceiba tree fruit. It was recently discovered that the absorption capacity of this fiber is also higher than that of the polypropylene material normally used in the cleanup of environmental oil spills. \\"The wood of the Ceiba tree is exceedingly lightweight and easily worked. However, because it lacks durability and is susceptible to insects and decay, it was mostly used for the construction of large canoes by the indigenous inhabitants of the region.\\" Canoes made of Ceiba tree trunks were able to seat over 100 men.

The film's script was written by Robert Glaudini, based on his 2007 play Jack Goes Boating.

His best friend and co-worker Clyde (John Ortiz) and Clyde's wife Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega) set up a dinner date at their house with Lucy's new co-worker, Connie (Amy Ryan), who has intimacy issues of her own. As Jack and Connie get to know each other, he sets his sights on learning to swim so he can take her boating when summer comes; with Clyde eager to help him learn, they begin swimming lessons. Jack soon decides that summer is too far away to wait for a date with Connie, so he decides that a nice dinner would be a good place to start. When Connie says that no one has ever cooked a meal for her, Jack decides that he wants to be the chef and cook for her. This adds another set of lessons to be learned as Jack does not know how to cook, so Clyde sets Jack up with a chef friend of Lucy's to learn the culinary art form. As Jack strives to perfect swimming and cooking, he begins to get a look behind the veil of the marriage of his friends, which is straining under the weight of mutual occasional infidelities. As the troubles of their marriage become increasingly apparent, Jack and Connie grow closer: Her general mistrust gradually erodes, and he gains confidence and skill in relating to her and in pursuing his dream job.

In the 1960s and 1970s, economists such as Edmond Malinvaud, Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman, Axel Leijonhufvud, Robert Clower, and Jean-Pascal Benassy investigated how economic policy would impact an economy where prices did not adjust quickly to changes in supply and demand. The most notable case occurs when some external factor causes high levels of unemployment in an economy, leading to households consuming less and firms providing less employment, leading to a rationing of both goods and work hours. Studies of general disequilibrium have been considered the \\"height of the neoclassical synthesis\\"Romer, 5. and an immediate precursor to the new Keynesian economics that followed the decline of the synthesis. Studies of general disequilibrium showed that the economy behaved differently depending on which markets (for example, the labor or the goods markets) were out of equilibrium. When both the goods and the labor market suffered from excess supply, the economy behaved according to Keynesian theory. See also *Effective demand *Disequilibrium (economics) References * Mankiw, N.

The church complex contains a main chapel surrounded by two more chapels and a baptistery with a cruciform font. The origin of the church's name is obscure, as it does not have one hundred doors, or gates. One theory suggests that it is a corruption of the name \\"Katapoliani\\", i.e. \\"Lower Town church\\", as it lies by the sea in the lower part of the town of Parikia. The church dates to 326. Its oldest features likely predate the adoption of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire in 391. The church was purportedly founded by the mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (ruled 306-337), Saint Helen, during her pilgrimage to the Holy Land when she stopped to worship at a chapel on the island. Later Justinian is credited for initiating construction on the site as well. The site was badly damaged by an earthquake in the 18th century, but gradually restored.

The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory. Duck orchids have a single leaf and one or a few, dull- coloured, inconspicuous flowers. Most species are found in Western Australia but one species (C. major) occurs in eastern Australia and one (C. minor) occurs in eastern Australia and New Zealand. Orchids in this genus as well as the hammer orchids (Drakaea) are pollinated by male thynnid wasps. Labelled diagram of Caleana nigrita Description Orchids in the genus Caleana are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs usually with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and a dark red, oval-shaped, tuber. Replacement tubers called \\"droppers\\" form at the end of long root-like stolons. A single linear to egg-shaped leaf long develops near the base of the plant during the growing season and withers late in the flowering season. The leaf is folded lengthwise and often has purple markings. The flowering stem is wiry, dull brownish maroon and bears one to a few flowers each on a stalk long, each with a small leaf-like bract. The flowers are non-resupinate and glabrous. The dorsal sepal and the two lateral petals are similar in size and are narrow linear in shape with pointed or club-shaped ends. The dorsal sepal points downwards and is pressed against the column. The lateral sepals and two petals usually spread obliquely downwards and sideways. The dorsal sepal and petals are attached to the base of the column where it joins to the ovary. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum. Duck orchids have an unusual, insect-like labellum which is attached to the rest of the flower by a sensitive stalk which holds the labellum above the flower in the \\"set\\" position. The labellum is attached to the column by a flexible \\"claw\\" which bends under the weight of a pollinating wasp. The column has broad wings and when the labellum is touched, it rapidly turns down, trapping a visiting insect between the labellum and column wings so that the insect comes into contact with the sexual parts of the column. The labellum is flask- shaped, narrowing near the end with the narrow end covered with small raised calli or glands which are usually black, but may be maroon or greenish. In some species the calli may cover a greater part, or even all of the labellum (as in P. minor). Glands on the labellum emit pheromones which are sexual attractants for male thynnid wasps. Flowering occurs in spring in most species and is followed by the fruit which is a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing up to 500 seeds. Taxonomy and naming The genus Caleana was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The name Caleana honours George Caley. There has been disagreement about the classification of this genus and its relationship with Paracaleana. In 1989 Mark Clements noted that none of the characters used to separate Paracaleana from Caleana is \\"sufficiently significant\\" to maintain two genera. A recent (2014) paper reports that recent molecular studies suggest that Caleana and Paracaleana are congeneric. However, the Western Australian Herbarium and several recent field guides to the orchids of Western Australia accept Paracaleana. =Species list= The following is a list of the species of Caleana accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as at April 2018. *Caleana alcockii (Hopper & A.P.Br.) M.A.Clem. – Alcock's duck orchid (Western Australia) *Caleana brockmanii (Hopper & A.P.Br.)

M.A.Clem. – Esperance duck orchid (Western Australia) *Caleana terminalis (Hopper & A.P.Br.) M.A.Clem. – smooth-billed duck orchid (Western Australia) *Caleana triens (Hopper & A.P.Br.) M.A.Clem. – broad-billed duck orchid (Western Australia) Distribution and habitat The Western Australian duck orchids usually grow in sandy soil near areas that are swampy in winter where they often grow with hare orchids (Leporella), hammer orchids (Drakaea) and beak orchids (Pyrorchis). Caleana major which occurs in eastern Australia and C. minor which is found in both eastern Australia and New Zealand grow in woodland, damp heath shrubland and grassland, sometimes on rocky slopes or in gravelly soil or on road verges. Ecology Orchids in the genus Caleana are pollinated by male thynnid wasps which are attracted to the flower by pheromones. When a wasp lands on the labellum, in its attempt to copulate with it, the labellum is flipped downwards against the column. If the flower has not previously been visited, pollinia in the column will adhere to the insect's back. When that insect visits another duck orchid and the process is repeated, the transported pollinia will adhere to the stigma of the second flower and it will be pollinated.

During World War II, he worked as a draftsman with the Federal Public Housing Authority and with Seattle architect Paul Thiry. After the war he studied at the Harvard Graduate School of Design under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, was in the same class as I.M. Pei, and graduated with a Masters of Architecture in 1946.I.M. Pei Bassetti worked for Alvar Aalto in Boston before returning to Seattle where he worked for Naramore Bain Brady Johanson (NBBJ) 1946-1947.U. of W. digital library Within his first year there, a Bassetti-designed house won an award sponsored by The Seattle Times and the local AIA office. In 1947 he established his first firm by renting space in the office of friend Jack Morse; together they established the architectural firms of Bassetti & Morse, Architects (1947–1962), with Wendell Lovett as one early employee, and later Honolulu-based Bassetti, Morse and Tatom, Architects. In 1962 Bassetti and Morse separated, with Bassetti first practicing as Fred Bassetti & Company, Architects, later as Bassetti Norton Metler Architects with partners Skip Norton and Richard Metler, then also with Karlis Rekevics as Bassetti/Norton/Metler/Rekeviks Architects. In 1990 Lorne McConachie became a partner.Joe Nebbefield in Design Intelligence 1999 By 1994 Bassetti and all other titled principals had retired. The firm has since operated as Bassetti Architects under McConachie and new partners.Bassetti Architects Bassetti's teaching career included positions as a guest critic at Columbia University, lecturing at Columbia University, MIT, Rice University, and the Universities of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia. Architectural legacy Fred Bassetti has been grouped with other Seattle architects of the period in what is sometimes called the \\"Northwest School\\", whose work in the years after 1945 was said to reflect and/or embody the spirit of the Pacific Northwest. Architects sometimes included in this group include Lionel Pries, Arne Bystrom, Wendell Lovett, Paul Kirk, Roland Terry, Alan Liddle, Gene Zema, Ralph Anderson, and others. Several living members of the group were profiled in the 2010 film \\"Modern Views.\\" Modern Views - A Conversation on Northwest Modern Architecture - synopsis Various commentators have suggested that key features of the Northwest School's work are the influence of the Pacific Northwest climate and landscape on modern design, materials selection, and a legacy of environmental responsibility. Concrete and steel are hallmarks of modernism, but in the Pacific Northwest there was also a passion for natural materials. Wood framing, wood siding and wood shingles often appeared in Bassetti’s early residential projects.

The Dura-Europos church (also known as the Dura-Europos house church) is the earliest identified Christian house church. It is located in Dura-Europos in Syria. It is one of the earliest known Christian churches,The people are holy: the history and theology of Free Church worship by Graydon F. Snyder, Doreen M. McFarlane 2005 page 30 and was apparently a normal domestic house converted for worship some time between 233 and 256, when the town was abandoned after conquest by the Persians. It is less famous, smaller, and more modestly decorated than the nearby Dura-Europos synagogue, though there are many other similarities between them. Although the fate of the church structure is unknown after occupation by ISIS, its famous frescos were removed after discovery and are now preserved at Yale University Art Gallery.Yale University History The site of Dura-Europos, a former city and walled fortification, was excavated largely in the 1920s and 1930s by French and American teams. Within the archaeological site, the house church is located by the 17th tower and preserved by the same defensive fill that saved the nearby Dura-Europos synagogue. The building consists of a house conjoined to a separate hall-like room, which functioned as the meeting room for the church. No prominent altar was found and archeologists are unsure where exactly it was located. In contrast the room serving as the baptistry is very developed.Neil Xavier O'Donoghue, \\"Liturgical Orientation: the Position of the President at the Eucharist\\" in Joint Liturgical Studies No. 83 The surviving frescoes are probably the most ancient known Christian paintings. The \\"Good Shepherd\\", the \\"Healing of the paralytic\\" and \\"Christ and Peter walking on the water\\" are considered the earliest depictions of Jesus Christ.Graydon F. Snyder, Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine, pp. 129-134, (Mercer University Press, 2003) google books A wall was demolished to make space for the large assembly room. This signified the shift to \\"church houses\\" which were more permanently adapted for religious use. A much larger fresco depicts three women (the third mostly lost) approaching a large sarcophagus. This most likely depicts the three Marys visiting Christ's tombYale: \\"Unearthing the Christian building\\", p.4, while another interpretation sees here the depiction of the Parable of the Ten VirginsSanne Klaver: The Brides of Christ: The Women in Procession in the Baptistery of Dura-Europos, in: Eastern Christian Art, 9 (2012-2013), pp. 63-78 There were also frescoes of Adam and Eve as well as David and Goliath. The frescoes clearly followed the Hellenistic Jewish iconographic tradition, but they are more crudely done than the paintings of the nearby Dura-Europos synagogue.F.

S. Bentzen (13 September 1882 – 1956) was a Norwegian tailor and politician for the Labour and Social Democratic Labour parties. He was a son of tailor Wilhelm Julius Bentzen (1855–1911) and Sofie Nilson (1859–1936), and learned the trade from his father. He studied further in Kristiania, Copenhagen and Berlin. He completed his Gesellenprüfung in 1904, and acquired burghership in Hønefoss in 1911. He had joined the labour movement in 1904, and was a member of the executive committee of Hønefoss city council from 1910 to 1922, serving as mayor from 1913 to 1915. He founded the first trade union in Ringerike, in 1903, and was also involved in the temperance movement as the county leader of Det Norske Totalavholdsselskap. He stood for general election several times, first in the single-member constituency Kongsberg og Hønefoss. In the 1912 election, Bentzen was the deputy candidate of J. O. Jarnæs, but the constituency was carried by Nils Gulliksen Berg. In the 1915 election, Bentzen (with Jarnæs as running mate) won the first round against Berg with 2,394 against 1,684 votes; but lost the second round with 2,753 against 3,038 votes. In 1918 he was however elected, and from 1919 to 1921 he served one term in the Parliament of Norway, representing the urban constituency Kongsberg, Hønefoss og Notodden. He headed his ballot in the Market towns of Buskerud county for the 1921 general election but was not re-elected. Bentzen was a member of the Labour Party's central board from 1915 to 1918. He also represented his party in the Defence Commission of 1920. In 1921 he left the Labour Party, joined the Social Democratic Labour Party. He was a member of their national board from 1921 to 1927. The two parties then reunited. From 1923 to 1925 he was the burgomaster of Hønefoss. He was again a councilman from 1931 to 1941, and mayor briefly in 1946. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany he was arrested and incarcerated in Grini concentration camp from 20 September to 28 November 1944, then in Akershus Fortress until the war's end. He died in 1956. Together with Anna Gulliksen (1884–1942) he had the son Torfinn Bentzen, a barrister and conservative politician.

The fossils are found in relatively few places worldwide; most specimens are known from the upper part of the Wewoka formation in and around Lake Okmulgee in Okmulgee State Park or the adjoining Dripping Springs State Park in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma in the United States. G. wardi was first described by B.F. Howell in 1945, and is the only species in the genus Gymnophyllum. Many specimens of G. wardi are known, ranging in age from very young and immature to very old individuals. The individuals are described as \\"flat disclike solitary corallites\\", with exposed septa almost everywhere on the base, though not at the peduncle in the center, which is depressed. The top of the coral disc has a \\"large smooth axial area\\" and shorter septa. The youngest individuals have long septa, which can be somewhat crooked; the axial center has a deep fossula which contains the cardinal septum, which is thick and short. Older corals have a large axial area with the cardinal fossula and projecting septa at their edges, making them appear like a \\"toothed wheel\\". In mature specimens, the fossula has almost disappeared and the top axial area is smooth and wide with septa that project slightly starting outside this area, and continuing almost to the basal peduncle, which is small. The oldest specimens are flat, have \\"short deformed septa\\" and no fossula, but do have a theca between the basal septa. Some specimens consist of two corralites joined together. All of these physical characteristics are similar to those of some other fossil coral species, like Hadrophyllum orbignyi. G. wardi and other similar fossil corals may even have been able to move along the sea floor or right themselves if tipped over. Samples of G. wardi can be in diameter. They are found in outcrops of shale from the Wewoka formation, and may be collected along the shores of Lake Okmulgee by getting in the shallow water, \\"washing the edge with a container of water, and watching carefully for little discs freed from the sediment\\". The University of Kansas Biodiversity Research Center has a large collection of fossils. Park rangers have discouraged fossil collection in the park; fossils are on display in the park's shop and are available for sale from some dealers.

He edited the newspapers Vest-Finnmarken Socialdemokrat from 1916 to 1917 and Nordlys from 1917. While editing Nordlys he was a member of Tromsø city council for several years. When the Labour Party split in 1923, Kaasmoli joined the Communist Party. The newspaper situation in the city was complicated. Nordlys first followed the Communist Party, but he was fired as the newspaper came on Labour Party hands with issues on 15 and 17 November 1923. On 17 November, the Communist Party also made a one-off issue of the new newspaper Troms Fylkes Kommunistblad, before Nordlys returned to Communist Party hands from 20 November 1923 to 20 January 1924. Kaasmoli was also re-hired. Then, after Nordlys again became a Labour newspaper, Troms Fylkes Kommunistblad was restarted. Kaasmoli edited it until the newspaper's demise later in 1924.

He was born in Kristiania as a son of mason Gustav Wilhelm Iversen (1859–1898) and Augusta Josefine Andersen (1858–1921). He attended the Royal School of Drawing from 1897 to 1898, but became a mason's apprentice after his father died. At the same time he had higher ambitions. To work his way upwards in society, he studied economics on his own, took voice classes from an actress to be a better orator, and was active in his trade union. He joined his first trade union in 1898, and the Labour Party in 1899. He chaired the trade unions Murernes Union from 1900 to 1902 and Norsk Murerforbund. From 1901 to 1903 he worked as a travelling agitator for the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions. He chaired Kristiania faglige samorg from 1908 to 1913, and was the deputy leader of the Confederation of Trade Unions from 1908 to 1910, later secretary from 1911 to 1915. He was a member of the executive committee of Oslo city council from 1908 to 1926, from 1917 to 1919 as deputy mayor under Carl Jeppesen. In the 1912 general election, Iversen was fielded as Labour's deputy candidate in the constituency Gamle Aker, as running mate of Gustav Adolf Lammers Heiberg. The constituency was carried by the Conservative candidate. In the 1915 general election, Iversen was fielded as Labour's deputy candidate in the constituency Gamle Aker, as running mate of Per Kviberg. The constituency was again carried by the conservatives. In the 1921 general election, Iversen was the fifth ballot candidate for his new party, the Social Democratic Labour Party. He was the sixth candidate in 1924. He was a member of the Social Democratic Labour Party until 1927, when the party reunited with Labour. He was also a member of Riksmålsvernet. Iversen was also chairman of Oslo Gassverk, Brenselscentralen and Folketeatret, and was a member of the Labour Court of Norway from 1916 to 1927 and a board member of the Norwegian Refugee Council. He was also a member of the Sports Committee of 1935, which prepared a merger between the sports confederations in Norway. From 1915 to 1941 he had his daytime job in the municipal administration of Oslo; he was fired because of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany and was then a member of the leading resistance circle Kretsen/Hjemmefrontens Ledelse. On 8 May 1945, when the Quisling regime ceased to function, Iversen was named as one of eight Chief Officers in the Government Ministries, and was acting Chief of the Ministry of Social Affairs. His tenure ended on 14 May, whereupon he became an adviser for the Minister of Social Affairs until July. He was then appointed as the first director of the Norwegian Directorate of Labour, where he remained until 1950. He was decorated as a Commander of the Order of St. Olav in 1949, and the Medal of St. Hallvard in 1956. He died in October 1967 in Oslo.

It first aired on October 18, 2010. Plot The episode starts with Abbey (Jennifer Grey) giving birth to a baby in a hospital, in the company of her adult daughter Justine (Gabrielle Christian) who is later implied to be a result of an unplanned pregnancy. The baby experiences breathing problems, which House and his team conclude is caused by pulmonary edema secondary to a liver failure causing insufficient production of plasma proteins. They suspect Caroli disease to be the underlying cause of the liver failure, but fail to confirm it, leaving the case still inexplicable. Meanwhile, following Cuddy's directive, House challenges Foreman and Taub to hire a female doctor to join the team. When Cuddy asks House to babysit her daughter, Rachel, both House and Wilson learn a few hard lessons in parenting. While babysitting, House is momentarily distracted by trying to leave Wilson to babysit Rachel, and Rachel makes a mess of his Chinese takeout food. Wilson pulls a coin from her mouth and fears she has swallowed the change from the Chinese food. House and Wilson surreptitiously keeps her under observation after they think that there is a dime missing from the change, but they later realize that they had miscalculated the bill and that all of the change was accounted for. House decides to buy time by transfusing the newborn with the mother's blood. The baby improves but the team is unsure why. The mother has melanoma, a mole under her finger nail, which has been passed to the baby. She is unusually healthy for someone with late-stage melanoma, and the team discover it is because she also has lung cancer which is causing antibodies to be created which are fighting off the melanoma and giving her blood an added factor which helped the baby. The team recommends surgery to treat her lung cancer and chemotherapy for the baby, but she opts to postpone the surgery for nine days in order to continue transfusions until the baby fully recovers. She dies unexpectedly of a pulmonary embolism, but her blood harvested at autopsy is enough to cure her baby. Justine, apparently having practically become an unplanned parent, holds her baby sister in her arms. Later, House and Cuddy are asleep and one has to go check on Rachel. House lets Cuddy do so, and over the baby monitor he hears Cuddy exclaim, \\"What? How did you eat a dime?\\" To which Rachel replies, \\"House\\", closing the episode with House's eyes opening in surprise.  Critical response  Zack Handlen at The A.V. Club rated the episode C+.

He challenged the Mexican president to a duel on the border to settle the matter, and decided that Guatemala needed a navy. McGarvie-Munn was at that time an artist and member of the Royal Institute of Naval Architects, an association of naval architects. Fuentes founded the Guatemalan Navy and made McGarvie-Munn briefly the Commander in Chief of the Navy. In 1974 McGarvie- Munn acquired the seventeenth-century Château of Entrecasteaux in Var, southeast France, which became his principal residence. Hugh Ian McGarvie-Munn and his son Iain Lachlan McGarvie-Munn immediately began the restoration of this château which had fallen into ruin and opened it to the public. Upon McGarvie-Munn's death his son continued the restoration. It was largely due to their efforts that Entrecasteaux has become a popular destination for artists and tourists.

Author: Ryūtei Tanehiko, Illustrator: Utagawa Kunisada is the Japanese term for picture books. It may be applied in the general sense, or may refer specifically to a type of illustrated volume published from at least the mid-Edo period onwards, often as chapter-books in series. In English, it is this second usage which is the more common, i.e.: Japanese picture-books of a specific format (and produced in the traditional manner). E-hon were traditionally produced as woodblock prints on thin washi paper (printed on one side only, then folded in half, creating a \\"leaf\\" with printing on both sides), bound together (right- to-left page order) with a simple external threaded binding; typically black (sumi) ink on white paper, often with polychromatic cover designs and sometimes with (usually more limited) internal colouring. Extremely popular during the late Edo-Meiji era. The modern Japanese manga format was created as a combination of ehon chapter-books with western-style comic books. E-hon production was a significant part of the Japanese publishing industry (particularly) during the 19th century; most Japanese woodblock print artists of the period produced e-hon designs (often in large quantities), as commercial work. However, the publication of e-hon dates back as far as the Muromachi Period. Toward the end of the 19th century, e-hon chapter-books were eclipsed in popularity by the new \\"western\\" concept of literary magazines. These were larger books which contained more, and a wider range of material per-issue, but usually fewer pictures (measured on a text-to-images ratio). They often used more modern printing methods; the increase in production costs was offset by increased efficiency, larger-scale printing and distribution, and the introduction of advertising. Typically, a magazine would include one large folded, polychrome illustration referencing some \\"feature\\" story in the volume, as a frontispiece. Such pictures, woodblock-printed in colour, are known as kuchi-e. The new format also absorbed most of the remaining talent and market for ukiyo-e style prints. {Akaei-no-uo from the Ehon Hyaku Monogatari - circa 1841 |An image from the e-hon series Raigo Ajari Kaisoden/Priest Raigo's Mysterious Rat(s); story by Kyokutei Bakin, this edition was illustrated by Katsushika Hokusai – circa 1808 |} References Ukiyo-e genres Japanese books Japanese art ","title":"E-hon"},{"id":"29001667","text":"The 1959 VFL Night Premiership Cup was the Victorian Football League end of season cup competition played in September of the 1959 VFL Premiership Season.

The mission of ZMT is to provide a scientific basis for the protection and sustainable use of tropical coastal ecosystems by conducting research, capacity development and consulting activities in close cooperation with national and international partners in the tropics. Since its launch in 1991, ZMT has also developed a huge network of research and political partners within the tropics and worldwide, including more than 800 alumni. The institute offers a broad range of research infrastructure, including its own scientific diving centre and laboratories such as the Marine Experimental Ecology Facility (MAREE). ZMT also hosts the Future Earth Coasts (FEC) office, a global network of experts investigating the drivers of global change in coastal zones. The centre was founded as research institute affiliated with the University of Bremen in 1991. Since 2009 ZMT is an independent research institute and member of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community. ZMT is also a member of the Deutsche Allianz für Meeresforschung (German Alliance for Marine Research).  Background  Coral reefs, mangrove forests and seagrass meadows as well as rivers, estuaries, coastal waters and upwelling areas comprise some of the most important tropical coastal ecosystems. They are in close physical, biological and geochemical interaction as transitional areas between land and water and host high biodiversity. However, climate change, overexploitation of resources, population increase, and urbanisation profoundly alter these ecosystems. These developments impact social-ecological and socio-economic structures and confront society with the need for sustainable management of coastal ecosystems. Tropical coasts are particularly vulnerable to transformations in their morphology, ecological conditions, and societal dynamics. Facing these challenges requires a holistic view that encompasses entire social-ecological systems in their complexity. Research at ZMT, therefore, spans across various disciplines and methodologies in natural and social sciences, and involves transdisciplinary stakeholders at science-to-policy and science-to-practice interfaces. This approach can be regarded as a unique feature of ZMT. ZMT specifically addresses major societal issues, particularly the ongoing provisioning and sustainable use of ecosystem services and the protection of ecosystems along the densely populated and dynamically developing tropical coasts. Active partnerships with academic institutions and actors from civil society, industry, and policy in the tropics form a transregional research network of immense scientific, technical, and societal expertise. Based on its research activities, ZMT advises policy- and decision-makers with regard to mitigation and adaptation strategies. In accordance with the credo of the Leibniz Association theoria cum praxi, ZMT's emphasis ranges from fundamental research to problem-oriented applied research. Combining research with capacity development in the field of scientific expertise and ecosystem management, ZMT conducts research projects with partners in tropical countries that contribute to a sound scientific basis for implementing coastal zone management strategies.  History  In 1991, the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen founded the Center for Tropical Marine Ecology (ZMT). The initiator and founding director was Gotthilf Hempel, who in 1980 already successfully founded the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven. Venugopalan Ittekkot succeeded Gotthilf Hempel and guided ZMT for more than 10 years. ZMT expanded steadily, and became a member of the Leibniz Association in 2009. In 2010, Hildegard Westphal was appointed as new scientific director at ZMT and established ZMT as strong Leibniz Institute, expanding the disciplinary spectrum and the size considerably. In addition, Nicolas Dittert joined the ZMT leadership in 2017 with the new additional position of Administrative Director. The institute was restructured in 2010/2011 and since then consists of four scientific departments and one infrastructure department. At the beginning of 2017, ZMT changed its name from Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Ecology to Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research. In 2020, about 220 scientists, doctoral candidates, technical staff and guest scientists work at the institute.  Research Practice  ZMT has the overarching vision to contribute to enabling people in tropical coastal regions to live healthy, self-determined, and safe lives that offer them positive perspectives in terms of education and personal development. ZMT operationalises its vision across the three pillars of its mission by: *conducting empirical research in the field and the laboratory, as well as data analyses at ZMT; *supporting the development of academic structures in tropical coastal countries; *collecting, evaluating, and providing research data to the scientific community, as well as to policy- and decision-makers and the public; *offering academic training, in particular for doctoral candidates; *providing advice to industry, policy, and civil society in the field of sustainable use of tropical coastal ecosystems; and *supporting the formation of South-South networks as a contact hub.  Teaching and Training  ZMT scientists teach at German Universities with which ZMT joint professors are affiliated (University of Bremen, Jacobs University Bremen, University of Oldenburg, University of Kiel), and at international universities. In cooperation with the University of Bremen, ZMT offers the international Master's programme ISATEC. ISATEC is tailored to the tropical coastal zone and its resource management. It is taught in English and is interdisciplinary in scope. In the 20 years since its inception 1999, about 335 graduates from more than 62 countries have completed the programme.  Working Areas  ZMT is organised in four scientific departments: (1) Biogeochemistry and Geology, (2) Ecology, (3) Social Sciences, and (4) Theoretical Ecology and Modelling, complemented by a (5) Research Infrastructure Department, and the Science Management. The scientific departments are composed of 20 working groups and junior working groups. In order to facilitate the interdisciplinary work, ZMT activities are structured in cross-cutting programme areas, forming a matrix across the departments. Departments and working groups: (1) Biogeochemistry and Geology (Hildegard Westphal) * Geoecology and Carbonate Sedimentology (Hildegard Westphal) * Submarine Groundwater Discharge (Nils Moosdorf) * Ecological Biogeochemistry (Tim Jennerjahn) * Carbon and Nutrient Cycling (Tim Rixen) * Tropical Marine Microbiology (Astrid Gärdes, junior working group) * Coral Climatology (Henry Wu, junior working group) (2) Ecology (Martin Zimmer) * Mangrove Ecology (Martin Zimmer) * Fish Ecology and Evolution (Oscar Puebla) * Reef Systems (Sonia Bejarano) * Ecophysiology / Experimental Aquaculture (Andreas Kunzmann) * Fisheries Biology (Werner Ekau, retired) * Algae and Seagrass Ecology (Mirta Teichberg, junior working group) (3) Social Sciences (Achim Schlüter – interim) * Institutional and Behavioral Economics (Achim Schlüter) * Social-ecological Systems Analysis (Marion Glaser) * Deliberation, Valuation and Sustainability (Marie Fujitani, junior working group) (4) Theoretical Ecology and Modeling (Jan Haerter) * Complexity and Climate (Jan Haerter) * Systems Ecology (Agostino Merico) * Resource Management (Matthias Wolff ) * Spatial Ecology and Interactions (Hauke Reuter) * Data Science and Prediction (Arjun Chennu) (5) Infrastructure (Nicolas Dittert)  Collaborations  The main asset of ZMT lies in the systematic dialogue between key disciplines necessary for a holistic assessment of coastal and marine resources and their use as well as sustainable governance in the tropics. The ZMT approach relies on consistent, transparent, and respectful collaboration and shared responsibilities with its worldwide partners in tropical countries based on mutual trust and respect. ZMT conducts this alliance in a transparent manner and on an equal footing to cultivate debates and to provide the intellectual foundation for action from a scientific perspective. This manifesto was formalised in the Bremen Criteria , developed by ZMT in 1991, and updated in 2015, creating the basis for the planning, development and structure of ZMT’s projects.  Equipment and Infrastructure  The ZMT has several chemical and biological laboratories as well as seawater testing facilities for experiments and the evaluation of samples taken in the field. In 2011, ZMT commissioned its extended marine aquarium system MAREE (MARine Experimental Ecology) which has 24 mesocosms. The facility can be used to design supplementary laboratory experiments under controlled conditions. [8] MAREE has five independent water circuits and a total of more than 60 maintenance aquariums for carrying out scientific experiments. The laboratory is equipped so that a number of environmental conditions such as temperature, nutrient and light availability as well as pH and water flow can be adopted. ZMT hosts a research diving facility established in 2013. It is accredited to undertake training for gaining the certificate of a German Research Diver. It is the only facility in Germany training for tropical waters. The ZMT office for Knowledge exchange was established in JAHR and supports and facilitates stakeholder exchange with non-scientific partners, industry collaboration, and networking activities. It is a hallmark for the dedication of ZMT to embed its research in stakeholder needs from the very beginning of a project.  Financing and Organization  ZMT is organised and financed within the framework of the Leibniz Association by the Federal Government and the Länder. In addition, third-party funds are raised, including financing through German Research Association (DFG), the EU and the ERC, the German Federal Ministries of Education and Research (BMBF), for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), for Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety (BMU), and other German ministries, as well as development agencies and banks (e.g. GIZ, KfW), and in cooperation with businesses and other organisations.

Park had come to power as the head of the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction after the May 16 coup of 1961, and in 1963 he won elections and assumed office as civilian president.  Background  = July 4th North–South Joint Declaration = Kim Il-sung On May 4, 1972, the director of Korea Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), Lee Hu- rak, went to North Korea and met Kim Il-sung. They announced the North-South Joint Declaration with the three principles of the reunification. After the declaration, a direct phone cable was installed between Seoul and Pyeongyang. Enthusiasm for reunification was heating up. Park used it as a pretext for the amendment of the constitution. = Third term of the presidency = Under the Third Republic's constitution, the president was limited to two terms in office. However, the National Assembly, dominated by Park's Democratic Republican Party, amended the Constitution in 1969 to allow a third term. He was re-elected in the 1971 presidential election. = 1971 legislative election = The 8th general election was held on May 5, 1971. Park's Democratic Republican Party took 113 seats out of 204. However, it didn't reach the minimum condition to pass a constitutional amendment. It required the concurrence of two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly. Therefore, Park couldn't amend the constitution through the lawful procedure.  Timeline  = 1969 referendum = In 1969, with a one-time amendment of the constitution, the incumbent president–Park–was allowed to run for a third consecutive term. = Declaration of a state of emergency = In December 1971, shortly after winning a third term, Park declared a state of emergency \\"based on the dangerous realities of the international situation.\\" = Coup = On October 10, 1972 Park dissolved the National Assembly, suspended the constitution and declared martial law. Universities were closed also. The press, radio and television were subjected to censorship, and speech was significantly restricted. Work was then begun on a new constitution, which was completed in October 27 by the emergency State Council. The event was named after Japan's 1868 Meiji Restoration. Park Chung-Hee, a former officer in the Japanese-controlled Manchukuo Imperial Army, admired Japanese politics, and called his self–coup Yusin (or Yushin), the Korean pronunciation of the Japanese word Ishin (restoration). The new administration established after the coup is now called the Yusin Regime (유신체제, 維新體制) or Yusin Dictatorship (유신독재, 維新獨裁). Constitution of the Fourth Republic Under the Yusin regime, the Constitution of the Third Republic of Korea was replaced by the Yusin Constitution, the Constitution of the Fourth Republic. In accordance with the Yusin Constitution, an electoral college called \\"Tongil Juche Gungmin Hoeui\\" (통일주체국민회의, the National Council for Unification) was set up. Tongil Juche Gungmin Hoeui became a sovereign organization that elected the president and one-third of parliament. Furthermore, unlike its predecessor, the new constitution lacked provisions regarding presidential term limits; elections were held every six years, but there were no constitutional restrictions on the number of terms one could serve. It essentially guaranteed presidency for life for Park Chung-Hee. It also allowed the president to declare Gingeup Jochi (긴급조치권, \\"emergency measures\\"), which allowed the president to promulgate laws without ratification by the National Assembly and suspend civil liberties. In practice, the conference's power to appoint one-third of legislators was exercised by him, guaranteeing him a parliamentary majority and control over the legislative branch. Combined with his broad powers to rule by decree and curtail constitutional freedoms, the Yusin Constitution endowed the president with nearly all governing power in the nation. Aftermath The Yusin Regime was soon challenged by activists from groups such as college students, artists, religious leaders, and the opposition. Park suppressed these protests by force. In the People's Revolutionary Party Incident, eight persons were executed for treason. The only evidence, their confessions, were extracted by torture, and the executed are now generally considered to have been innocent. Nevertheless, the resistance to the Yusin Regime continued and caused serious social unrest. The Yusin Regime was criticized internationally for human rights abuse. The American Carter Administration warned that United States military forces might be withdrawn from South Korea unless Park eased off his dictatorship. On October 26, 1979, the \\"10.26 Incident\\" occurred—the assassination of Park Chung–hee by members of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Park's assassination removed the main impetus of the Yusin Regime. Although the military took power by consecutive coups (the 12.12 Coup d'état and the 5.18 Incident) after Park's death, there was a general consensus that the Yusin Constitution was no longer viable. The military junta promulgated the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, which officially replaced the Yusin Constitution in 1980. This new constitution was liberal compared to the Yusin Constitution, although it was still an authoritarian one.

He has worked with the BBC and Granada Television, and together with Cliff Twemlow formed one half of the composition partnership Peter Reno. Early life Taylor began his music career studying pianoforte at Ardwicke Central High School in Manchester. Inspired and entranced by the virtuosity of alto saxophonist Freddie Gardener, Peter went on to study at the Regional School of Music in Manchester as a saxophone and clarinet student under John Roadhouse, lead saxophonist with the Northern Variety Orchestra of the BBC. Soon, Peter became involved with the Northern Dance Orchestra of the BBC, where all the Regional School of Music's tutors were members in various disciplines. In 1956 Peter became a pupil of Professor Fred Dickinson of the Royal Northern College of Music, studying clarinet. During his time there he founded his vast knowledge of the classical repertoire and became associated with members of the Halle Orchestra, which included Martin Milner as band leader, Jean Bell on Harp and Rayson Whalley on percussion. In those early days of his musical career Peter played in many Northern 'Palais-De-Danse' orchestras, or 'dance bands', with which he regularly performed at the Ritz and Plaza ballrooms in Manchester. Peter's career developed further when he began playing for the Raymond Woodhead Band at the Ashton Palais, which was a famous band at the time. As Peter became a more accomplished baritone saxophone player it attracted more gigs for him, although he was also working as a music copyist for the BBC orchestras at the time.  Career at Granada Television  His work with the BBC soon led to him joining Granada Television as a Music Librarian, Advisor, Supervisor, Head of Copyright and a Contractor. During his time at Granada Television, Peter commissioned high-profile theme tunes and incidental music, including 'Façade Suite' by William Walton for 'Northern News', Ravel -Mussorgsky's 'Pictures at an Exhibition' for 'The Verdict Is Yours', 'English Dances' by Malcolm Arnold for 'What the Papers Say' and many other highly successful and recognisable soundtracks. Probably the most famous piece he commissioned was called 'Lancashire Blues' by Eric Spear for a new soap opera with the working title of 'Florizel Street'. The story goes that a tea lady named Agnes remarked that 'Florizel' sounded like a brand of disinfectant, so the name of the soap opera was changed. Since it first aired in 1960, the 'Lancashire Blues' chosen by Peter has become one of the Twentieth Century's most iconic theme tunes to what we now know as Coronation Street. At Granada, Peter worked alongside music directors Peter Knight and Derek Hilton, with whom he planned many musical strategies including Mr. Hilton's composition for 'Country Matters' which was awarded an Ivor Novello Award. He also worked with drama directors Henry Kaplan, Silvio Narrizano and Cliff Owen on music content, and later with Claude Whatham, Mike Newell and Michael Apted, who all went on to become highly respected film directors. Peter soon began composing music himself, and had pieces featured on regional programmes such as 'What's On' and 'This is Your Right' and school programmes like 'Picture Box'. Following his initial few successes, he went on to co- write the memorable theme tune for the 1970s TV series Crown Court for De Wolfe Music, performed by the Simon Park Orchestra, as well as music for an animated cartoon series called 'The Magic Ball'.De Wolfe Music Compact Disk Catalogue 1988 printed by The Abrose Press 01-518 6638 After Granada bought sheet music publishers Novello and Co. in 1970, Peter resigned from the broadcasting company, but still gleaned some satisfaction from commissioning composer Derek New to write 'College Boy' for University Challenge, which is still in use today, as well as the theme to 'What The Papers Say'. Following his departure from Granada, Peter forged a new career in Personnel and Training Development having gained a professional qualification from the Chartered Members of the Institute of Personnel and Development. Peter Taylor's most notable music supervision was for TV drama 'Double Indemnity' directed by Cliff Owen which aired in 1960 as part the 'ITV Play of the Week' series. He also cites the music content for documentary series 'The Fifties' as one of his favourite projects. Other notable projects on his credits include the 1956 documentary show 'Zoo Time', which used Prokofiev's 'Peter and the Wolf', the long-running 'World in Action' documentary series which ran from the early sixties until the end of the nineties and used a theme tune credited to Jonathan Weston (but composed and improvised by guitarist Shawn Phillips and organist Mick Weaver), which Peter commissioned. Other notable programmes on his list of credits include 'Under Fire', which included 'Rodeo Ballet' by A.Copeland, and 'Searchlight' which included a symphony by Shostakovich. Peter is still involved in all matters musical to this day. He has written many library tracks for De Wolfe Music, some of which are available currently on '70s: The Original Soundtrack' (DWCD0255), as well as classical fanfares and pieces on 'Classics 4' (DWCD0139), while some more of his tracks appear on 'Movie Archive – The Silent Film Era' (DWCD0096) and 'Come Dancing' (DWCD0104).

The package stemmed from a joint venture between Raycom and Jefferson-Pilot Teleproductions, which acquired the rights to ACC basketball in 1982 under the banner Raycom/JP Sports. In 2004, Jefferson-Pilot's ACC football package (which began in 1984) was also moved under Raycom/JP Sports. Jefferson-Pilot was acquired by Lincoln National Corporation in 2006, who would in turn sell its media assets to Raycom in 2006. In 2010, ESPN acquired the rights to ACC basketball and football, but continued to sub-license games to Raycom Sports to continue the syndicated package, which was relaunched under the ACC Network brand. Broadcast games were shown locally on over-the-air broadcast stations, regional sports networks, as well as streaming on ESPN3 and WatchESPN.Press Release (July 1, 2014). \\"ACC Network Has Expanded National Reach\\" Raycom Sports. Retrieved February 2, 2015. In July 2016, ESPN announced an extension of its contract and plans to launch an ACC cable channel of the same name in 2019, and took ownership of the ACC rights that were previously sub-licensed to Raycom. In anticipation of the new channel, the \\"ACC Network\\" branding during its syndicated telecasts was phased out in 2018. Although ESPN will continue to subcontract Raycom Sports resources for the new channel, Raycom's final syndicated ACC telecast—the 2019 ACC men's basketball championship game—aired March 16, 2019. History ACC men's basketball had been broadcast by Raycom/JP Sports, a joint venture of Raycom Sports and Jefferson-Pilot Teleproductions, since the 1982-1983 basketball season. The roots of the current package date to 1957, when Greensboro businessman C.D. Chesley hastily assembled a five-station network to broadcast North Carolina's appearance in that year's Final Four. The Tar Heels went on to win the national championship, and Chesley expanded to a full-season package for the 1957-58 season. Chelsey retained the rights until his retirement in 1981, and then Baltimore-based Metrosports had the ACC rights just for the 1981-82 season. The first ACC basketball telecast by Raycom/JP Sports was an early-season game between the Virginia Cavaliers and the Duke Blue Devils on the night of December 8, 1982.2007 ACC Tournament Official Program, page 24. It was uncertain whether this first broadcast was going to happen at all until the 9 p.m. tip-off; many East Coast network affiliates were unexpectedly carrying national coverage of a hostage situation at the Washington Monument, tying up the AT&T; network lines required for Raycom to distribute the game. Jefferson- Pilot Teleproductions was the sole producer of ACC football beginning with the 1984 football season, but the Raycom/JP Sports joint venture began to include ACC football for the 2004 season.ACCSlicks.pdf Raycom Sports. Retrieved February 2, 2015. In 2006, JP Sports' parent company, the Jefferson Pilot Corporation, merged with Lincoln National Corporation, taking the broadcasting and sports broadcasting divisions with it. JP Sports became Lincoln Financial Sports, thereby renaming the joint venture Raycom/LF Sports. Lincoln announced the sale of its media assets to Raycom Media in November 2007, making Raycom Sports the sole producer of all ACC projects and, from January 2008 until March 2009, SEC men's basketball and football. In 2010, ESPN acquired rights to ACC football and basketball, replacing Raycom. In a discussion between ACC commissioner John Swofford and then-ESPN president John Skipper, Swofford acknowledged Raycom's long-standing relationship with the conference, and requested that it continue to be involved in some way. ESPN negotiated a sub- licensing agreement with Raycom, which would allow it to continue producing a syndicated package of ACC football and basketball broadcasts. As a condition of the deal, they were rebranded under the new on-air title ACC Network. As part of the agreement, Raycom also agreed to operate the ACC's website and digital properties. It was suggested that ESPN agreed to Raycom's involvement so it would not create conflicts with the SEC Network—ESPN Regional Television's then-new package of syndicated Southeastern Conference football and basketball games, established after ESPN replaced Raycom as the SEC's main rightsholder besides CBS. Raycom began syndicating the ACC Network beyond the ACC footprint sometime between 2010 and 2013. Beginning with the 2014-2015 academic season, following the discontinuation of ESPN's syndicated SEC package after the launch of the SEC Network cable channel, Raycom expanded the ACC Network's distribution up to 84% of the entire United States. =Future= On July 21, 2016, ESPN announced a 20-year extension of its ACC rights, and that it would launch a new ACC cable network, also known as ACC Network, in 2019, with its accompanying digital platform ACC Network Extra launching in the 2016-17 season. As part of the establishment of the channel, ESPN acquired Raycom Sports' previous package of games. As of the 2018 ACC football season, the telecasts returned to primarily using the Raycom Sports branding rather than ACC Network. Raycom Sports will continue its role as the ACC's in-house digital media partner, and ESPN will subcontract production resources from Raycom Sports for the new channel. Raycom's final syndicated ACC telecast was the 2019 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament final. Distribution =United States= Upon its final season ACC Network included: *35 CW affiliates (including WTTO in Birmingham, WCCT in Hartford, WTOG in Tampa, WUPA in Atlanta, WNOL in New Orleans, WKBD in Detroit, KPLR in St. Louis and KMYS in San Antonio) *32 MyNetworkTV affiliates (including WUXP in Nashville, WDCA in Washington, WNDY in Indianapolis, WUAB in Cleveland, and WCGV in Milwaukee) *20 independent stations (including WLNY in New York and KTXA in Dallas) *12 Fox affiliates (including WOFL in Orlando and WXIX in Cincinnati) *11 CBS affiliates (including WFOR in Miami, WJZ in Baltimore and WBTV in Charlotte) *10 NBC affiliates (including WRAL in Raleigh) *9 ABC affiliates (including WHAS in Louisville, WPVI in Philadelphia and WTAE in Pittsburgh) Outside of the U.S., the telecasts could be received in Canada via historic superstations still carried on cable, such as Boston's WSBK-TV, and during its final seasons, WPCH-TV in Atlanta (the former WTBS), as well as over-the-air signals receivable in border markets.

An eponymously named debut Gilbert album completed in 2007 received excellent reviews and extensive national radio airplay, gaining a digital release soon after on the independent record label, Shifty Disco Records. In 2010, the latest Gilbert album, Wahoola!, was released. About the new record Linley wrote: \\" I wanted 'Wahoola!' to more obviously feature the talents of the people who have been performing the first album live.....especially Maud Waret's vocals and Brian Lee's violin-playing\\". In 2013 Gilbert Linley licensed the album 'Wahoola!' to Felt Music Library. 2014 saw a new album and musical project named AztecCormorant. In 2016, Linley collaborated with bandmate from Engineers, Mark Peters, on a new album and project entitled 'Salt Rush with Mark Peters'. This album was released by the record label Pedigree Cuts (part of Warner/Chappell Production Music) Musical style Linley's music is often stylistically eclectic and eccentric, crossing genres such as folktronica, electronica, classical music, dream pop and spoken word. The music is in general richly layered, combining vintage analog synths and organs with orchestral instruments such as harp, celeste and strings. Vocals by Maud Waret have also featured more prominently in recent work. The music is performed live by five musicians playing an array of musical instruments. Gilbert has gigged extensively throughout the UK, including sets at the 2007 Green Man Festival, 2008 Brighton Loop, and 2009 Southbank Udderbelly. Gilbert also supported Mice Parade and Silje Nes in London, in October 2010. Broadcast performances Gilbert has been featured on BBC Radio 6 Music's BBC Introducing with Tom Robinson, BBC Radio 1 with Huw Stephens, Gary Crowley and on BBC Radio 3's Mixing It. Gilbert tracks have also been licensed by 20th Century Fox for use on the Max Payne soundtrack DVD.

It is located about south of Simon's Town on the road to Cape Point. History Old image probably of a section of the Molteno family's retreat in Millers Point, c 1920s Miller's Point got its name when the land was sold to Edmund Miller in 1825, who developed it as a whaling station. However the whaling operations were stopped in the 1850s and, for almost a century, the coast remained unused apart from occasional fishermen. In the 1920s, the land was bought by the Molteno family of Cape Town who used it as a family retreat and closed it off from public access. In 1961, the Moltenos donated the land to the city for conservation. The land has now been integrated into the Table Mountain National Park and the family's manor is now a restaurant complex.http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/CCT_Beaches_- _a_diversity_of_coastal_treasures_2009.pdf Current Use Restaurant complex at the site of the old manor on the Millers Point coast The area around the former manor is now a recreational area, and a portion of the land is leased to the Cape Boat and Ski-boat Club. The rest of the property (extending from the Swartberg Mountains down to the False Bay coast) is now a nature reserve, with some provision for holiday accommodation. The headland has repeatedly been under consideration for a lighthouse, however none has been built to date. The point itself has two beaches, several sheltered coves and tidal pools. =Whale watching= This is a popular spot for whale watching, especially from early July to November. There are two deep pools, just to the north of the point, where the whales are able to come in close to the shore and can often be seen breaching. Southern right whales are most common and come here in the spring with their calves. Other whales, as well as dolphins, can sometimes be seen too. The beaches are sheltered from the wind and there are panoramic views of False Bay from further up the slopes. =Public access for boating= The slipways of Miller's Point are the only public access slipways on this part of the False Bay coastline, and they are much used by recreational and commercial fishermen. =Shipwrecks= Miller's Point has become a popular launching site for wreck diving trips, as well as dives on the nearby reefs. Two frigates, two fishing boats and an offshore mining vessel were scuttled in Smitswinkel Bay by the Navy in the early 1970s, to form an artificial reef which has proved to be a success. These ships now sit upright on the sea bed, about 4 km from the launching point. In addition, the SAS Pietermaritzburg, formerly HMS Pelorus (which led the D-Day invasions of Normandy) was scuttled in shallow water (20m) just off Miller's Point and the Portuguese liner Lusitania (which lies in deeper water at Bellows Rock near Cape Point after running aground there in 1911) is also most conveniently accessible from Miller's Point launches. =Water sports= Millers Point is a popular site for seakayaking, surfskiing, shore-entry scuba diving, spear- fishing and yachting. Flora and fauna Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos on the mountain slopes of Miller's Point The main indigenous ecosystem of the area is Peninsula Granite Fynbos, a critically endangered vegetation-type that occurs nowhere else in the world. Mature Granite Fynbos is dominated by large tree- Proteas, such as the tree pincushion-protea and the waboom, and a dense under- layer of asteraceous (daisy) species. There are a variety of species (some already extinct) which are naturally restricted to this specific vegetation type, occurring nowhere else in the world. The primary threat to this ecosystem is invasive alien plants, such as the Australian Port Jackson and rooikrans acacias. Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos, a less severely endangered vegetation-type with a different range of species, can be found on the higher slopes, including a vast number of endemics. This tiny ecosystem (restricted to the upper slopes of Cape Peninsula mountains) has an extraordinarily rich biodiversity, with roughly the same number of plant species as can be found in the whole of the United Kingdom. Since being established as a marine sanctuary, inshore fishing has been prohibited and the rocky coastline has recovered its abundant marine life. This plentiful sea life has made the point an attraction for recreational scuba divers.

Landing in New York the pair start out with dreams of making it big but soon find themselves in dead-end jobs and drifting apart. As Seamus pursues various get rich quick schemes, the more cautious Patrick holds down a janitors job and plays good Samaritan to washed up alcoholic author Tom Finnegan (Malachy McCourt). Along the way Patrick falls for Helen (Beverley Elder), a struggling actress entangled in a messy break up with Jeffrey (Roger Davis). Everything comes to a head when Seamus turns to backroom gambling, Tom hits rock bottom and Jeffrey makes a vicious play to win Helen back. Development Beyond the Pale began its life at a table in the Film Centre Cafe in Hells Kitchen NYC in June 1996 when George Bazala and Patrick Clarke thrashed out an idea based on the life of an Irish immigrant in late 1980s New York City. The pair had just finished working together on 'Fall from Grace' a Hunter College grad thesis short film. Work on the script was completed in August 1996, NYU film grad Jack Alvino signed on as co-producer and Maiden Voyage Pictures was formed to seek finance for filming. Preparations got underway to shoot the film's opening segment in Clarke's hometown of Dublin, Ireland. This would prove to be an extremely ambitious undertaking considering they had only raised US$20,000. Clarke flew to Dublin on December 2, 1996, to make preparations for the arrival of the crew and to scout and secure locations and equipment. A week later, Bazala flew in to audition actors. By the time Alvino and the rest of the crew arrived, everything was miraculously in place. The tight five-day shooting schedule with a skeleton crew proved extremely tough. Clarke's friends and relatives were drafted in to help with everything from catering to horse wrangling. On 19 December, the opening eleven minutes of Beyond the Pale was in the can. Bazala recalled, “We were all very anxious to see the results of our adventure in Dublin. Unfortunately, we would have to wait until February 1997, when we had raised the funds to process, sync and transfer the film. It was mid-March before editor Michael Sullivan had completed a rough cut. We couldn’t have been happier with the outcome”. Beyond the Pale had its world premiere at the Galway Film Fleadh on 5 July 1999 and its US premiere at the 33rd Houston International Film Festival (9 April 2000) where it won for best dramatic feature film.http://www.houstontheatre.com/award2000.html Cast *Patrick Clarke as Patrick Shaw *Malachy McCourt as Tom Finegan *Conn Horgan as Seamus O'Sullivan *Beverley Elder as Helen *Roger Davis as Jeffrey *Ruth Miller as Miss Mooney *Valentina Olmos as Conchita *Brian Mallon as The Cop *Iris Braydon as Lily *Worth Howe as Mr Arnold *William Stone Mahoney as Gambler *Neale Harper as Bob *Catherine Natale as Margie *Jason Killalee as Sean *Tom Finegan as Man on Street (Cameo) *Eric Mabius as Brian (Cameo) Awards Beyond the Pale won for best drama at the 2000 Houston Film Festival.http://www.houstontheatre.com/award2000.html Filming locations *Dublin, Ireland *Manhattan, New York *Brooklyn, New York *Queens, New York *Staten Island, New York References External links Beyond the Pale trailer * 2000 films American films Irish films American biographical films Irish biographical films ","title":"Beyond the Pale (film)"},{"id":"29002325","text":"Tephra horizons in Iceland Marker horizons, chronohorizons, key beds or marker beds are stratigraphic units of the same age and of such distinctive composition and appearance, that, despite their presence in separate geographic locations, there is no doubt about their being of equivalent age (isochronous) and of common origin. Such clear markers facilitate the correlation of strata, and used in conjunction with fossil floral and faunal assemblages and paleomagnetism, permit the mapping of land masses and bodies of water throughout the history of the earth. They usually consist of a relatively thin layer of sedimentary rock that is readily recognized on the basis of either its distinct physical characteristics or fossil content and can be mapped over a very large geographic area.Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, J.A., eds. (2005) Glossary of Geology (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp. As a result, a key bed is useful for correlating sequences of sedimentary rocks over a large area. Typically, key beds were created as the result of either instantaneous events or (geologically speaking) very short episodes of the widespread deposition of a specific types of sediment. As the result, key beds often can be used for both mapping and correlating sedimentary rocks and dating them. Volcanic ash beds (tonsteins and bentonite beds) and impact spherule beds, and specific megaturbidites are types of key beds created by instantaneous events. The widespread accumulation of distinctive sediments over a geologically short period of time have created key beds in the form of peat beds, coal beds, shell beds, marine bands, black shales in cyclothems, and oil shales. A well- known example of a key bed is the global layer of iridium-rich impact ejecta that marks the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–T boundary). Palynology, the study of fossil pollens and spores, routinely works out the stratigraphy of rocks by comparing pollen and spore assemblages with those of well-known layers—a tool frequently used by petroleum exploration companies in the search for new fields. The fossilised teeth or elements of conodonts are an equally useful tool. The ejecta from volcanoes and bolide impacts create useful markers, as different volcanic eruptions and impacts produce beds with distinctive compositions. Marker horizons of tephra are used as a dating tool in archaeology, since the dates of eruptions are generally well-established. One particular bolide impact 66 million years ago, Chicxulub, controversially held to have led to a major extinction event, produced an iridium anomaly that occurs in a thin, global layer of clay marking the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Iridium layers are associated with bolide impacts and are not unique, but when occurring in conjunction with the extinction of specialised tropical planktic foraminifera and the appearance of the first Danian species, signal a reliable marker horizon for the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Fossil faunal and floral assemblages, both marine and terrestrial, make for distinctive marker horizons. Some marker units are distinctive by virtue of their magnetic qualities. The Water Tower Slates, forming part of the Hospital Hill Series in the Witwatersrand Basin, include a fine-grained ferruginous quartzite which is particularly magnetic. From the same series a ripple marked quartzite and a speckled bed are used as marker horizons. On a much smaller time scale, marker horizons may be created by sedimentologists and limnologists in order to measure deposition and erosion rates in a marsh or pond environment. The materials used for such an artificial horizon are chosen for their visibility and stability and may be brick dust, grog, sand, kaolin, glitter or feldspar clay.

Freud regarded God as an illusion, based on the infantile need for a powerful father figure; religion, necessary to help us restrain violent impulses earlier in the development of civilization, can now be set aside in favor of reason and science.Armstrong, Karen. A History of God (New York: Ballantine Books 1993) p. 357 Freud's religious background In An Autobiographical Study, originally published in 1925, Freud recounts that \\"My parents were Jews, and I have remained a Jew myself.\\" Familiarity with Bible stories, from an age even before he learned to read, had \\"an enduring effect on the direction of my interest.\\" In 1873, upon attending the University at Vienna, he first encountered antisemitism: \\"I found that I was expected to feel myself inferior and an alien because I was a Jew.\\"Freud, Sigmund, An Autobiographical Study (New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1989 [1952]) pp. 13–14. In a prefatory note to the Hebrew translation of Totem and Taboo (1930) Freud describes himself as \\"an author who is ignorant of the language of holy writ, who is completely estranged from the religion of his fathers—as well as from every other religion\\" but who remains \\"in his essential nature a Jew and who has no desire to alter that nature\\".\\"Freud, Sigmind Totem and Taboo (New York: W.W. Norton & Co. 1950) p. xi Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices In Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices (1907), his earliest writing about religion, Freud suggests that religion and neurosis are similar products of the human mind: neurosis, with its compulsive behavior, is \\"an individual religiosity\\", and religion, with its repetitive rituals, is a \\"universal obsessional neurosis\\".Gay, Peter, editor, The Freud Reader (New York: W.W. Norton & Co. 1995) p. 435 Totem and Taboo In Totem and Taboo, published in 1913, Freud analyzes the tendency of primitive tribes to promulgate rules against incest within groups named for totem animal and objects, and to create taboos regarding actions, people and things. He notes that taboos (such as that regarding incest) still play a significant role in modern society but that totemism \\"has long been abandoned as an actuality and replaced by newer forms\\". Freud believes that an original act of patricide—the killing and devouring of \\"the violent primal father\\" was remembered and re-enacted as a \\"totem meal...mankind's earliest festival\\" which was \\"the beginning of so many things—of social organization, of moral restrictions and of religion\\".Freud, Sigmind Totem and Taboo (New York: W.W. Norton & Co. 1950) pp. x, 142 Freud develops this idea further in Moses and Monotheism, his last book, discussed below. He further goes to attribute creation of gods to humans: \\"...we know that, like gods, [demons] are only the product of the psychic powers of man; they have been created from and out of something.\\"Freud, Sigmund \\"Totem and Taboo\\" (chapter 2, kindle edition) In An Autobiographical Study Freud elaborated on the core idea of Totem and Taboo: \\"This view of religion throws a particularly clear light upon the psychological basis of Christianity, in which, it may be added, the ceremony of the totem-feast still survives with but little distortion in the form of Communion.\\"Freud, Sigmund, An Autobiographical Study (New York:W.W. Norton & Co., 1989 [1952]) pp. 130–131 The Future of an Illusion In The Future of an Illusion (1927), Freud refers to religion as an illusion which is \\"perhaps the most important item in the psychical inventory of a civilization\\". In his estimation, religion provides for defense against \\"the crushingly superior force of nature\\" and \\"the urge to rectify the shortcomings of civilization which made themselves painfully felt\\". He concludes that all religious beliefs are \\"illusions and insusceptible of proof\\". Freud then examines the issue of whether, without religion, people will feel \\"exempt from all obligation to obey the precepts of civilization\\". He notes that \\"civilization has little to fear from educated people and brain-workers\\" in whom secular motives for morality replace religious ones, but he acknowledges the existence of \\"the great mass of the uneducated and oppressed\\" who may commit murder if not told that God forbids it, and who must be \\"held down most severely\\" unless \\"the relationship between civilization and religion\\" undergoes \\"a fundamental revision\\". Freud asserts that dogmatic religious training contributes to a weakness of intellect by foreclosing lines of inquiry. He argues that \\"in the long run nothing can withstand reason and experience, and the contradiction which religion offers to both is all too palpable.\\"Gay, Peter. Freud: A life for our time (New York: Norton, 1998) p. 535 The book expressed Freud's \\"hope that in the future science will go beyond religion, and reason will replace faith in God\\".Mary K. O'Neill and Salman Aktar, eds, On Freud's 'The Future of an Illusion' (London: Karnac Books, 2009) p. x In an afterword to An Autobiographical Study (1925, revised 1935), Freud states that his \\"essentially negative\\" view of religion changed somewhat after The Future of an Illusion; while religion's \\"power lies in the truth which it contains, I showed that that truth was not a material but a historical truth.\\"Freud, Sigmund, An Autobiographical Study (New York:W.W. Norton & Co., 1989 [1952]) pp. 130–131, 138 Harold Bloom calls The Future of an Illusion \\"one of the great failures of religious criticism.\\" Bloom believes that Freud underestimated religion, and that as a result his criticisms of it were no more convincing than T. S. Eliot's criticisms of psychoanalysis. Bloom suggests that psychoanalysis and Christianity are both interpretations of the world and of human nature, and that while Freud believed that religious beliefs are illusions and delusions, the same may be said of psychoanalytic theory. In his view nothing is accomplished with regard to either Christianity or psychoanalysis by listing their illusions and delusions.Bloom, Harold. The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post- Christian Nation. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 34–35. Civilization and its Discontents In Civilization and its Discontents, published in 1930, Freud says that man's need for religion could be explained by \\"a sensation of 'eternity', a feeling as of something limitless, unbounded—as it were, 'oceanic'\\", and adds, \\"I cannot discover this 'oceanic' feeling in myself\\".Freud, Sigmund, Civilization and its Discontents (New York: Norton 1962), pp. 11–12 ) Freud suggests that the \\"oceanic feeling\\", which his friend Romain Rolland had described to him in a letter, is a wish fulfillment, related to the child's egoistic need for protection.Fisher, David, Cultural Theory and Psychoanalytic Tradition (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers Rutgers University 2009) p. 117 James Strachey, editor and translator of this and other works of Freud, describes the main theme of the work as \\"the irremediable antagonism between the demands of instinct and the restrictions of civilization\\".James Strachey, \\"Editors' Introduction\\", in Freud, Sigmund, Civilization and its Discontents (New York: Norton 1962), pp. 11–12 ) Freud also treats two other themes, the development of civilization recapitulating individual development, and the personal and social struggle between \\"Eros\\" and \\"Thanatos\\", life and death urges.Lee Siegel, \\"Freud and His Discontents\\", in The New York Times for May 8, 2005 https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/books/review/08SIEGELL.html?pagewanted=print Accessed January 25, 2011 Freud expresses deep pessimism about the odds of humanity's reason triumphing over its destructive forces. He added a final sentence to the book in a 1931 edition, when the threat of Hitler was already becoming apparent: \\"But who can foresee with what success and with what result?\\"Freud, Sigmund, Civilization and its Discontents (New York: Norton 1962), pp. 92 and editor's footnote ) Atheist political commentator and author Christopher Hitchens cited this book as a reason behind Freud being one of his most influential figures. Hitchens described the book as a \\"pessimistic unillusioned tale of realism,\\" noting that Freud \\"wasted little time in identifying [the need for religion] as infantile\\" and pointing out a summary by Freud's biographer Ernest Jones that \\"Human happiness, therefore, does not seem to be the purpose of the universe.\\" Freud, Sigmund, Civilization and its Discontents (New York/London W.W. Norton 2010), pp. 9-20 introduction ) Moses and Monotheism Moses by Michelangelo Moses and Monotheism was Freud's last book, published in 1939, the year of his death. In it, Freud makes certain guesses and assumptions about Moses as a historical figure, particularly that he was not born Jewish but was adopted by Jews (the opposite of the Biblical story) and that he was murdered by his followers, who then via reaction formation revered him and became irrevocably committed to the monotheistic idea he represented.Freud, Sigmund, Moses and Monotheism (New York: Vintage Books 1967Mark Edmundson, \\"Defender of the Faith?\\" The New York Times September 9, 2007 https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/magazine/09wwln- lede-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 Accessed January 24, 2011 Mark Edmundson comments that in writing Moses and Monotheism, Freud, while not abandoning his atheism, perceived for the first time a value in the abstract form of monotheism—the worship of an invisible God, without Jesus or saints—practiced by the Jews.Mark Edmundson, \\"Defender of the Faith?\\" The New York Times September 9, 2007 https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/magazine/09wwln- lede-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 Accessed January 24, 2011 In Moses and Monotheism, Freud proposed that Moses had been a priest of Akhenaten who fled Egypt after the pharaoh's death and perpetuated monotheism through a different religion.S. Freud, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume XXIII (1937-1939), \\"Moses and monotheism\\". London: Hogarth Press, 1964. According to Jay Geller, Moses and Monotheism is full of \\"false starts, deferred conclusions, repetitions, rationalizations, defensive self-justifications, questionable methods, and weak arguments that are readily acknowledged as such by Freud.\\"Jay Geller, \\"A PALEONTOLOGICAL VIEW OF FREUD'S STUDY OF RELIGION: UNEARTHING THE LEITFOSSIL CIRCUMCISION\\" Modern Judaism 13 (1993): 49–70 http://mj.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/1/49.full.pdf Accessed January 25, 2011 The Question of a Weltanschauung The later developments in Freud’s views on religion are summarized in his lecture on the Question of a Weltanschauung, Vienna, 1932. There he describes the struggles of science in its relations with three other powers: art, philosophy and religion. Art is an illusion of some sort and a long story. Philosophy goes astray in its method. Religion constructed a consistent and self-contained Weltanschauung to an unparalleled degree. By comparison science is marked by certain negative characteristics. Among them it asserts that there are no sources of knowledge of the universe other than the intellectual working over of carefully scrutinized observations, and none that is derived from revelation, intuition or divination. On relations between science and philosophy and science and religion Freud has this much to say in one sentence: “It is not permissible to declare that science is one field of human mental activity and that religion and philosophy are others, at least equal in value, and that science has no business to interfere with the other two: that they all have an equal claim to be true and that everyone is at liberty to choose from which he will draw his convictions and in which he will place his belief.” Then he goes on to say that such an impermissible view is regarded as superior and tolerant, but that it is not tenable, that it shares all the pernicious features of an entirely unscientific Weltanschauung and that it is equivalent to one in practice. With respect to religion in particular he explains that a religious person had once been feeble and helpless. A parent had protected him. Later such a person gets more insight into the perils of life and he rightly concludes that fundamentally he still remains just as helpless as he was in his childhood. Then he harks back to the mnemic image.Freud, Sigmund, New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis, New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1965, pages 195-202. Responses and criticisms In a 1949 essay in Commentary magazine, Irving Kristol says that Freud exposed what he believed to be the irrationality of religion without evidence, but has not substituted anything beyond \\"a mythology of rational despair\\".Irving Kristol, \\"God and the Psychoanalysts: Can Freud and Religion Be Reconciled?\\" Commentary Magazine November 1949 http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/god-and-the- psychoanalysts-br-em-can-freud-and-religion-be-reconciled-em--906 Accessed January 24, 2011 In a 1950 book entitled Christianity and Freud, Benjamin Gilbert Sanders draws parallels between the theory of psychoanalysis and Christian religion, referring to Jesus Christ as \\"the Great Psychiatrist\\" and Christians' love for Christ as \\"a more positive form of the Transference\\".\\"Freudian Christianity\\", Time Magazine, February 6, 1950 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811843,00.html Accessed January 24, 2011 Karen Armstrong notes in A History of God that \\"not all psychoanalysts agreed with Freud's view of God,\\" citing Alfred Adler, who believed God was a projection which had been \\"helpful to humanity\\", and C.G. Jung, who, when asked whether he believed in God, said \\"Difficult to answer, I know. I don't need to believe. I know.\\"Armstrong, Karen. A History of God (New York: Ballantine Books 1993) p. 357 Tony Campolo, founder of the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education, observes that \\"With Freud, God, and the need for God-dictated restraints, had been abolished,\\"Tony Campolo, \\"Religion After Freud\\", Huffington Post January 31, 2007 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-campolo/religion-after-freud_b_40071.html Accessed January 24, 2011 resulting in an increase in social chaos and unhappiness which could have been avoided by adherence to religion. A number of critics draw the parallel between religious beliefs and Freud's theories, that neither can be scientifically proven, but only experienced subjectively.

While at University of Minnesota Medical School, he worked with Jesse Francis McClendon on pioneering in situ pH measurements in the human digestive tract.

Synopsis Fiona (Radha Mitchell) and Ben (Joel Edgerton) are a couple from Australia—she is a successful, self-starting lawyer while he is a relaxed, easy-going musician. Fiona and Ben, who want to adopt a child, travel to India for what they imagine will be a quick and simple process. However, once they arrive in Calcutta (now Kolkata) they learn that little happens quickly in India, and for all the promises that have been made, they begin to doubt whether they will be able to complete the final stages of the adoption process. While Fiona stays in touch with her clients at home via the internet and deals with the legal red tape slowing down the adoption, Ben finds himself wandering the streets of Calcutta and adjusting to the rhythms of the city. The stress of the waiting period seems to reinforce the differences between Fiona and Ben, and tension begins to grow into anger and resentment; adding to Ben's dissatisfaction is his budding friendship with Scarlett (Isabel Lucas), an attractive fellow visitor who seems more compatible with his attitudes than his wife. Fiona, an atheist, finds herself at odds with the Indian people who are driven by religious tradition. As her stay in India progresses, the various unfamiliar sights evoke spiritual feelings in her. When Ben and Fiona finally go to the orphanage to meet their would-be daughter Lakshmi, they discover that she is chronically ill and likely unable to survive a flight to Sydney. Fiona and Ben are devastated when Lakshmi dies a few days later. Having lost all that they meant to find in India, the lovers decide once again that they need each other and engage in reconciliation.

His first experience of theatre was in Montreal, where, at the age of six, he was taken by his mother to see Sarah Bernhardt's farewell tour in Camille. During his youth in Canada he became attracted by silent films: \\"I learned courage from Pearl White, love from Rudolph Valentino, and laughter from Charlie Chaplin\\". After leaving school he worked in a bank, but was inspired to become an actor by seeing Donald Wolfit's performance in The Barretts of Wimpole Street in 1932.

The company initially sold its products in India, Russia, and Africa. The company went public in India in 1999, and used some of the proceeds to build its first research facility. Saldanha's son Glenn took over as CEO in 2001, having returned to India after working at PricewaterhouseCoopers. By 2008 Glenmark was the fifth-biggest pharmaceutical company in India. By 2011 the founder of the company was one of the richest men in India, and Glenmark had worldwide sales of $778 million, a 37% increase over the last year's sales; the growth was driven by Glenmark's entry into the US and European generics markets. In the mid-2010s the generics industry in general began transitioning to the end of an era of giant patent cliffs in the pharmaceutical industry; patented drugs with sales of around $28 billion were set to come off patent in 2018, but in 2019 only about $10 billion in revenue was set to open for competition, and less the next year. Companies in the industry responded with consolidation or trying to generate new, patented drugs. Glenn Saldanha took the company down the path of seeking innovation, which was controversial within the company and with shareholders. The company focused on new drugs and biosimilars in the fields of cancer, dermatology and respiratory diseases, which it sought to monetize by partnering with major pharmaceutical companies. In 2016 it had four such drugs in clinical trials. For the financial year 2016–2017 its sales were around 81 billion INR (ca. $1.25 billion), making it the fourth-biggest Indian pharmaceutical company. In May 2019, Yasir Rawjee was elected as CEO of Glenmark Life Sciences. Selected products Glenmark Pharmaceuticals announced that it entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Australia's Sequirus to commercialize its nasal spray Ryaltris™ which is a fixed-dose combination nasal spray of an antihistamine and a steroid, as a treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Ryaltris (olopatadine hydrochloride [665 mcg] and mometasone furoate [25 mcg]), formerly GSP 301 Nasal Spray, has been conditionally accepted by the FDA as the brand name. In June 2020, the company launched a potential COVID-19 drug Favipiravir under the brand name FabiFlu in India after studies found that there was some benefit of the drug in COVID-19 treatment. In August 2020, they also rolled out a higher strength version of FabiFlu.

Other caves in the area sheltered early humans. Prehistory is the longest period in the history of mankind, throughout of which writing was still unknown. In Transylvania specifically this applies to the Paleolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age.  Paleolithic  ;(2,600,000 – 13,000 BP) The Paleolithic epoch, the oldest and longest period in the history of mankind, is divided by specialists into three stages of development: Lower Paleolithic, Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic. The chronological frame of the Paleolithic coincides with that of the Pleistocene (the first period of the Quaternary), and is marked by four great glaciations, as established in the Alps (Günz, Mindel, Riss and, Würm). Fundamental elements for the technic description of a lithic flake. While an ever- increasing amount of data has become available on the evolution of the climate, fauna and vegetation of present-day Romania, there is very little in the fossil record to give researchers an idea of what Paleolithic man in Romania looked like. To date, no human skeletal remains dating from the Low Paleolithic have been found, while the only Middle Paleolithic remains that have been discovered were a number of phalanges unearthed by M. Roska in the Bordu Mare Cave at Ohaba Ponor (Hunedoara County). A skull capsule discovered by Roska in the Cioclovina Cave displays features attributed to Homo sapiens sapiens, and dates back to the Upper Paleolithic as indicated by three flint objects peculiar to the Aurignacian discovered next to them. Likewise, in the Ciurul Mare Cave in the Pǎdurea Craiului Mountains (Transylvania) speleologists have discovered some distinctively male, female and child footprints. An anthropological analysis has identified Cro-Magnon and even Neanderthal characteristics in these footprints. The economy of the Paleolithic communities consisted mainly of exploiting natural resources: gathering, fishing and especially hunting were the main pursuits of the diverse human groups. As early as the Lower Paleolithic, human groups either hunted or trapped game. We can assume that in Transylvania, alongside mammoths or deer, horses were a fairly important food source, if our dating of the painting on the ceiling of the cave at Cuciulat (Sǎlaj County) is correct. The Lower Paleolithic in Transylvania, because data are scarce, is largely a mystery. If the discovery of an Acheulean lithic item at Căpuşu Mic (Cluj County) and of several Pre-Mousterian lithic items at Tălmaciu (Sibiu County) are a certain fact, their precise stratigraphic position remains to be established. The same cannot be said about the discoveries in the Ciucului Basin at Sândominic (Harghita County) where several tools, and a rich fauna, have been encountered in certified stratigraphic positions, belonging to the geo-chronological interval covering the late Mindel to the early Riss. The Middle Paleolithic – Mousterian – covers a time period much shorter than that of the prior epoch (c. 100,000 – 33,000/30,000 BP). It is a period set largely in Early Upper Pleistocene, and corresponds within the alpine glacial chronology to the interval covering the late Riss-Würm interglacial, or rather the Lower Würm, through middle Würm, as indicated by the dating of the late Mousterian dwellings in the Gura Cheii Cave — Râşnov (Braşov County), and the Spurcată Cave — Nandru (Hunedoara County). The Mousterian period is closest to the alpine Paleolithic. Both periods were characterized by the presence of numerous quartzite slivers and chips, with the bones of hunted game outnumbering the tools. Consequently, specialists consider this Mousterian to be an \\"Eastern Charentian”. scraper on blade - 3 views of the same object. Likewise, North-Western and Northern Transylvania with the settlements at Boineşti (Satu Mare County) and Remetea (Maramureș County) have revealed several typically Mousterian tools (flake scrapers, blade scrapers, target points etc.), some of which have been associated with a later stage of the Mousterian, or even with a transition stage to the Upper Paleolithic, at the onset of the Aurignacian culture of the Upper Paleolithic. The process of regional diversification among cultures was accelerated in the Upper Paleolithic through the middle to upper Würm. The beginnings of the Upper Paleolithic on the territory of Romania is dated somewhere between 32,000/30,000 – 13,000 BP, corresponding paleoclimatically to the onset of the Arcy oscillation, and is marked by the development of the two great civilizations: the Aurignacian and the Gravettian both featuring several stages of development as established by stratigraphy. The onset of the Aurignacian culture seems to have paralleled the late Mousterian facies in the Carpathian caves, if we accept as valid the C14 dating of level IIb in the cave of Gura Cheii – Râşnov. Northwestern Transylvania is the site where layers of the Middle Aurignacian culture have been identified, as signaled by the presence of blade scrapers, refitted core, burins. In Banat, the settlements of Tincova, Coşova and Româneşti-Dumbrăviţa, have produced flint tools demonstrating that the Aurignacian in this area evolved closely with that in Central Europe (the Krems-Dufour group). Aurignician items were also found in the caves in the Western Carpathians, the most famous of which is the Cioclovina cave (Hunedoara County) - the site, around the start of the 20th century, of the first Paleolithic discoveries in Transylvania. The Eastern Gravettian had a long evolution, featuring several stages of development as documented especially by the settlements in Moldova. The Gravettian has left traces in the Ţara Oaşului and Ţara Maramureşului, the sites of microlite fashioned mainly out of obsidian indicating the connection with the Gravettian in the neighboring regions (Moldavia, South-Carpathian Ukraine, Eastern Slovakia, and Northeastern Hungary). The Late Gravettian covers Banat too, particularly the area of the Porţile de Fier of the Danube, where heads identical to the Laugerie-Basse type heads were discovered in grottoes and open air dwellings. Still in Banat, a culture with several stages of development was identified and subsequently named the Quartzite Upper Paleolithic by its discoverer, considered to be synchronous with the local Aurignacian, later the Gravettian, and regarded as a prolongation of the late stages of the Mousterian with quartz and quartzite tools (Eastern Charentian).  Epipaleolithic and Mesolithic  ;(13,000 – 9,500 BP) The Iron Gates of the Danube The populations evolving at the onset of the Bölling oscillation (approximately 12,000 BP) and which have continued to the end of the Preboreal have been generally attributed to the Epipaleolithic. Consequently, this historical period could be associated with the interval between 13,000 and about 9,500-9,000 BP. These communities continued the lifestyles of the Upper Paleolithic. Due to numerous factors, including changes in the climate, the small groups of hunters-fishermen-gatherers innovated tool and weapon types – producing, for instance, microlites (trapeze) — while also keeping the traditional tool types. The Iron Gates mesolithic culture of the central trans-Danube region, named by archaeologists after the gorge of Porţile de Fier (\\"Iron Gates\\"), was settled by a population attributed to the Late Epigravettian or Mediterranean Tardigravettian. The first stage of this period was discovered by archaeologists in the Climente II cave (Mehedinţi County), and the second stage, by discoveries in the shelter under the rocks at Cuina Turcului, Dubova, both of which are located in the same limestone massif — Ciucaru Mare. The two dwelling levels at Cuina Turcului have produced a large quantity of tools and weapons made of flint in particular, and less so of obsidian, bone and horn, as well as body ornaments (shells and drilled teeth, bone pendants, etc.) The ornaments are often decorated with incised geometrical patterns. The most remarkable is a drilled horse phalange, wholly ornamented and probably representing a female figure. Besides the mammal (beaver, boar, mountain goat, etc.), bird and fish remnants, fragments of human skeletons were also found. The Climente II cave has produced a human skeleton, set in a crouching position, and covered by a thick layer of red ochre, which is attributed to the Tardigravettian dwelling and which predates Level I at Cuina Turcului. The discoveries in the Clisura area display striking similarities to the industries of the Italian Peninsula — the expression of the migrant human bearers of the Late Epigravettian in the mentioned area.  Mesolithic  ;(9,500 – 7,500 BP) Male Cro-Magnon skull Specialist opinions fix the beginning of the Mesolithic era at the end of the Preboreal, its development throughout the Boreal, and its end as late as the beginnings of the Atlantic. Chronologically then, it can be set between 9,500-9,000 and 7,500 BP. Two cultures are documented on the territory of Romania in this time period: the Tardenoisian and the Schela Cladova types. The Tardenoisian spread in several of the country's regions (Moldavia, Muntenia, Dobruja), including the mountainous area of Transylvania in the southeast (Cremenea-Sita Buzăului, Costanta-Lădăuţi) and northwest (Ciumeşti- Păşune). In the settlement of Ciumeşti (Satu Mare County), besides the typically Central and East European Tardenoisian microlitice tools made of flint and obsidian, some artefacts were found in the form of circular segments and two triangular ones, in addition to trapezes. The fauna remnants indicate the presence of wild boar and deer. Some specialists do not exclude the possibility of identifying the Late Tardenoisian communities of the north- western Pontic or central European types (of which the settlement at Ciumeşti is one) as being in the process of neolithization, albeit incomplete, that is, displaying an incipient productive economy, whose foundations were laid by animal domestication and plant cultures. The Schela Cladovei culture is known through the nine open air settlements in the proximity of the Danube. The lithic utensils come in numerous atypical forms and are fashioned of quartzite and siliceous sandstone while an additional small number are made of flint. The horn tools (agriculture artefacts with one or two handle attachment holes) apparently indicate the debut of plant cultivation. Some of the larger river rocks flattened by water or some of the thicker slabs might have served for grinding. The examination of the fauna indicates an economy based mainly on hunting. The targeted game were deer, roebucks, European bisons, wild boars, hares, wild donkeys, foxes, etc. Furthermore, it would seem that the representatives of this culture domesticated the dog. Anthropological data are quite consistent. The physical type was evaluated as Oriental Cro-Magnon. The skeletons of the deceased were laid in rectangular holes, some dug in the floor of the dwelling itself. Part of them was laid in a crouching position, part was laid on their back, together with some of their personal belongings. Child mortality was high, while the average life expectancy for adults was 36.2 years. The discovery of some skeletons with arrowhead marks speaks of violent death. Research so far has proved that this culture does not have its roots in the Mediterranean type Tardigravettian, but rather originated by some new migration into the Porţile de Fier region. In addition, it would seem that on the arrival of the first bearers of the Neolithic civilisation (Precriş culture), the Schela Cladovei culture had already come to an end.  Neolithic  ;(6600 – 3500 BC) Sculpture found at the archaeological site of Lepenski Vir The Neolithic began with the slow migration of communities from the south of the Balkan Peninsula (the Protosesklo culture from the Thesalo-Macedonean area), who brought with them momentous economic progress. Consequently, the process of neolithisation, which is essentially a shift to plant growing and animal breeding, was not an innovation of the local Mesolithic population but rather the result of the penetration of this territory by communities carrying the Neolithic civilization. The normal divisions of the Neolithic are: Early Neolithic, Developed Neolithic and Chalcolithic (Copper Age). The Neolithic epoch on the territory of Romania, as certified by calibrated 14C dates, began around 6600 BC, and ended around 3800-3700 BC, and no later than 3500 BC. The Early Neolithic (c. 6600 – 5500 BC) consists of two cultural layers: genetically linked and with similar physiognomies. The first (layer Gura Baciului - Cârcea/Precriş) is the exclusive result of the migration of a Neolithic population from the South Balkan area, while the second (the Starčevo-Criş culture) reflects the process of adjusting to local conditions by a South Balkan community, possibly a synthesis with the local Tardenoisian groups. Layer Gura Baciului – Cârcea, also called the Precriş culture, is a spin-off of a Protosesklo culture group that advanced north and reached the North Danubian region where it founded the first culture of painted pottery in Romania. The small number of sites attributable to this early cultural time has not allowed the route followed by the group, to penetrate the Inter- Carpathian area, to be firmly established, yet in all likelihood, it was the Oltului Valley. Based on the stratigraphy in the site of Gura Baciului (Cluj County) and Ocna Sibiului (Sibiu County) the development of the culture is divided into three major stages. The settlements are situated on high terraces strung along secondary valleys. The dwellings are most often underground, but there are also ground level houses, usually standing on river stone platforms. Pottery (bowls, cups) is refined, with white painted dots or geometrical patterns on red or brown-red background. Concomitant with pottery, plant cultures and animal breeding, the new culture introduces implements of polished stone and the first clay statuettes. The dead are buried on the grounds of the settlements sometimes directly under the dwellings. Gura Baciului is the first site on the territory of Romania attesting incineration as a funerary practice. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic plastic art reveals a bipolar system of beliefs: the Great Mother, representing the female principle, and the Bull, representing the male principle. The presence among the findings at Gura Baciului of some anthropomorphic stone heads, similar to the famous stone heads of Lepenski Vir, signify possible contact between the locals, the Mesolithic cultures, and the newcomers. Furthermore, the adoption of these alien deities, even if exclusively a plastic substantiation, speaks of a remarkable process of assimilation, characteristic of the layer above mentioned. At Ocna Sibiului, at Precriş, level II, a small conical stone statuette was found, with a shape representing a couple embracing, and a plinth of the same material associated with the figure. On the statue and the plinth several symbols can be distinguished interpreted by the discoverer as ideograms. = Starčevo-Criş culture = Neolithic clay amulet (retouched), part of the Tărtăria tablets set, dated to 5500-5300 BC and associated with the Turdaş-Vinča culture. The Vinča symbols on it predate the proto-Sumerian pictographic script. Discovered in 1961 at Tărtăria, Alba County, Romania by the archaeologist Nicolae Vlassa. The Starčevo-Criş culture, representing the generalisation of the early Neolithic in the Intra-Carpathian territory, has been regarded by some as the prolongation of the Gura Baciului-Cârcea/Precriş culture, disregarding that it is probably the result of a new south Balkan migration (the Presesklo culture) arriving in Transylvania via Banat. The Starčevo – Criş culture has a long evolution in four stages. Dwellings were set up on meadows, terraces, hills and even in caves, wherever the environment was friendly. The dwellings were embedded in the early phases and were huts at ground level, in the later phases. Asymmetrical receptacles, bowls, spherical cups, all of which were made of clay, furnish the interiors of this culture. The lithic utensil inventory includes flint and obsidian microlites, as well as large polished stone axes of the Walzenbiele type. It is now, too, that the first small copper items occur sporadically. The pintaderas decorated with geometrical patterns as well as the Spondylus and Tridacna shells testify to possible connections with Eastern Mediterranean regions. Burials were performed both inside and among the dwellings. Anthropological analyses have revealed a major Mediterranean component suggesting a southern origin of this population. The Developed Neolithic (c. 5500 – 4000 BC) covers the interval between the last phase of the Starčevo – Criş culture and the beginnings of the Petreşti culture, the period including what has long been known as middle and late Neolithic. The Developed Neolithic is marked by the migration of some new groups of populations, whose point of departure was the south of the Balkan Peninsula, as part of the group of cultures with polished black pottery. These same groups created the Vinča culture (more commonly divided into four main phases: A, B, C and D), whose beginning is synchronous with the final phase of the Sesklo culture (Greece) occupying Banat and most of Transylvania. In about the same period, the north-east of Transylvania was penetrated by several groups, bearing the linear and musical note pottery culture. The Vinča culture in Romania comes in many forms depending on the local background against which it developed (the Starčevo-Criş culture and the linear pottery) and the degree of southern influence. The synthesis of the above-mentioned elements gave birth to numerous related regional elements, so that when referring to the Transylvania territory, specialists do not speak of a Vinča culture per se, but rather that of the Banat culture, the Bucovăţ group, the Pişcolt group, the Turdaş culture, the Cluj-Cheile–Turzii-Lumea Nouă-Iclod complex, the Iclod group. A general characteristic of these groups is the black polished pottery (cups, bowls, lids, etc.). The decorations are variously incised and impressed (bands filled in with stripes, in particular) in addition to displaying fine grooves. The statuettes feature oblong heads (possibly indicating a mask), cross-like bodies, and are often decorated with spiral winding patterns. In Banat, with the end of the Vinča A2 stage there emerges the Banat culture with several distinctive regional peculiarities (groups Bucovăţ and Parţa). The Parţa settlement, thoroughly researched, demonstrates that the culture reached a high level of civilization, attested to by the one storey buildings and by a complex spiritual life, partly decoded by the components of the great sanctuary studied here. The cult edifice (with maximum dimensions of 12x6x7m), with two stages of construction, had two chambers, the one to the east, the other to the west, separated by an altar table and then a wall. The west chamber served as a depository for daily offerings. In the foundation of the south entrance to this chamber was laid a zoomorphic idol and a tiny vessel. The east chamber served for the initiation ceremonies. Religious centers of this type through their prestige and grandeur most certainly congregated the population of an extended area. The charred seeds found in the Liubcova settlement indicate that several cereals were grown. Wheat prevailed, particularly the Triticum dicoccum species, as well as the Triticum monococcum and Triticum aestivus species in proportion of approx. 10%. The first occurrence on the territory of Romania of the Hordeum vulgare barley is seen. Also present are such leguminous plants as lentil and vetch. Of paramount interest is that wheat was harvested, as discovered in a settlement south of the Carpathians (Teiu, the Gumelniţa culture), and was possibly used in other areas, too. The wheat was harvested by pulling out, then was sheaved and tied with a switch, vine shoots or ivy. Once carried to the settlement, the grain was threshed. = Turdaş culture = Turdaş culture and Decea Mureşului culture artifacts at the Aiud History Museum, Aiud The Vinča communities that advanced on the middle course of the Mureş River, under the influence of the Starčevo-Criş traditions and the elements of the linear pottery, created a new cultural synthesis called the Turdaş culture. The occurrence of signs incised on the bottom of several vessels, particularly on those at Turdaş (Hunedoara County), have often been regarded as the potter's mark. More recently they have been considered by some researchers as early attempts at recording dates graphically. That things might stand this way is demonstrated, apparently, by the baked clay tablets covered with incised pictographic patterns at Tărtăria (Alba County), discovered, according to Nicolae Vlassa, in a ritual hole in the ground, next to clay and alabaster idols and a fragment of an anchor, all of which have triggered hot debate over the stratigraphy and chronology of the settlement. The preservation by some Starčevo-Criş communities of painted pottery, in addition to the Vinča elements, engendered in the area of the eastern arch of the Western Carpathians the Cluj-Cheile–Turzii-Lumea Nouă-Iclod cultural complex. This complex represents the substratum for the emergence of the Petreşti culture. Long term research at Iclod has demonstrated that this station possessed a complex fortification system built during the Iclod, Phase I, still in use for some time in the Iclod II phase, eventually abandoned when the settlement expanded. It is in the same spot that research has been carried in two inhumation necropoles, where the dead were laid on their backs hands across their chests or abdomens or along their bodies; the bodies were oriented east- west, their heads facing east. The inventory consists of vessels (cylindrical, painted bowls, and S profile pots), ochre, stone utensils, ornaments and animal offerings. = Chalcolithic = Artefacts of the Cucuteni-Ariuşd- Tripolie culture. On display at the National Museum of Transylvanian History, Cluj-Napoca The Chalcolithic, Eneolithic or Copper Age (c. 4600/4500 – 3800/3700 BC) is characterized by an ever-increasing number of copper items, as well as the presence of stone, bone, horn and baked clay utensils. It marks the first production of heavy copper tools and moulds, (axes – chisels and axes), in close conjunction with the exploitation of copper deposits in Transylvania. Gold is used for ornaments and the fashioning of such idols as those at Moigrad in the Bodrogkeresztúr-Gorneşti culture. The craft of pottery reaches a peak, exemplified by the great number of exquisitely decorated pots. Cultures typical for this period are the Cucuteni-Ariuşd, Petreşti culture|Petreşti, Tiszapolgár-Româneşti and Bodrogkeresztúr-Gorneşti. The first two cultures are among the numerous Eneolithic cultures with pottery painted in bi- and tri-chromatic patterns. At Ariuşd (Covasna County) in the east of Transylvania, the first systematic excavations were undertaken in what is considered the neo-Eneolithic epoch in Romania. The material discovered has been integrated into the greater painted pottery complex of Cucuteni-Ariuşd- Tripolie.  Petreşti culture  Petreşti culture pottery belonging to a ritual complex from Ghirbom, Alba. On display at the National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia The Petreşti culture diffused across almost all of Transylvania, is regarded as local in origin by some specialists, and as a migration originating from the southern areas of the Balkans, by others. It is primarily known for its painted decoration – patterns painted in red, brown- red, later brown, on a brick-red background, which testifies to the high standard of civilization of the bearers of this culture. The ornamental motifs consist in bands, rhombuses, squares, spirals and windings. The typical forms are bowls, tureens, high stands. Plastic art is fairly scarce and so are brass items.  Decea Mureşului culture  Stone mace head of Decea Mureşului type found at Șard, Alba. On display at the National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia The end of this culture has been associated with the entry into central Transylvania by the bearers of the Decea Mureşului culture/horizon and the Gorneşti culture. The graves at Decea Mureşului, according to some, are a continuation of the rituals of Iclod, whereas according to others, they are hard proof of the penetration of central Transylvania by a north-Pontic population. The presence of red ochre scattered over the skeletons, or laid at their feet in the form of little balls, as well as other ritual elements find better analogies, however, in the necropolis at Mariopol in south Ukraine.  Gorneşti culture  The Gorneşti culture, characterized by the occurrence of the so-called high-necked milk pots with two small protuberances pulled at the margin and drilled vertically, is a continuation of the [Româneşti] (featuring receptacles with bird bill protuberances and decorated with step or nettle incisions), in turn descended from the Tisa culture in the developed Neolithic period. The settlements of the neo-Eneolithic cultures were located on the low or high river terraces, on hilltops or hillspurs and consisted in several dwellings whose positions sometimes observed particular rules. Recent research has tended to focus on the defense systems (ditches and scarps) of these sites. The culture strata are thick and superposed forming at times regular tells. The dwellings of this period were of several types. The earth houses displayed an oval shaped hole, with a maximum of 5–6m and a minimum of 3m in diameter. On one of the edges a simple fireplace was built out of a smoothed layer of clay. The thatched roof was conical or elongated and was supported by a trestle. The one room rectangular surface dwellings are also documented as dating back to the beginning of the Neolithic. They had wattle walls pasted with clay mixed with straw. The roof was double sloping, and the floor was made of trodden clay. The Cucuteni dwellings in south-east Transylvania are spacious (40–100 m2 and more), often have a platform and are divided into two or more rooms. Vessel from the Middle Eneolithic Period found at Cheile Turzii. On display at the National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia Neo-Eneolithic sculpture is represented by cultic figures, idols, and talismans fashioned out of bone, stone or clay. These are human or animal representations conveyed by stylized or exaggerated body parts. Among the thousand anthropomorphous statues discovered, the female ones, symbols of fertility and fecundity, prevail by far. Herculane-Cheile Turzii culture vessel, dated 3800-3500 BC (Middle Eneolithic Period), found at Cheile Turzii. On display at the National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia Copper was first used for fashioning small implements or ornaments (needles, awls, fishing hooks, pendants, etc.), while gold was used solely for aesthetic and decorative purposes. For a long time the items were produced by the technique of hammering, for the technique of the casting mould as well as that of „cire perdue\\" (lost wax) emerged much later. Although there is no proof of the provenance of the first metal items, they are seemingly local rather than imported products. That does not necessarily suggest that metallurgy was the invention of the local population, for it might have been introduced as a result of contact with regions where metal processing had started earlier (in the East or the Caucasus). The Eneolithic marked a notable advancement in the development of metallurgy. Throughout this period copper artifacts are present in the settlements, in grave inventories or even in deposits (assemblies of whole or fragmentary objects concentrated in one, usually isolated, place). This period also marks a high incidence of flat axes, pins, simple or multi- spiral bracelets or necklaces. The most complex of all Eneolithic achievements is the axe. These weapon-implements are bound to the late phases of the Cucuteni, Decea Mureşului and Bodrogkeresztúr-Gorneşti cultures. The gold Eneolithic items, outnumbered by the copper, actually constitute the beginning of goldsmithing in the Transylvanian lands. An outstanding artifact was the great gold pendant in the thesaurus of Moigrad (Sălaj County), which is 30 cm in height and weighs 750g. We know little about the racial types of the Transylvanian Neolithic population. The area of some of the cultures, for instance Cucuteni, lack funeral finds, for they are the expression of ritual practices that elude archeological methods. The little anthropological data available (Gura Baciului, Iclod) suggests Mediterranean-type physical features. The role of the invasion of the pastoral tribes coming from the north-Pontic (supposedly Indo-European kinship) in bringing to an end the Eneolithic culture of sedentary farmers, represents one of the hotly debated issues among specialists in the prehistory of south-eastern Europe. What once might have seemed exclusively a migration of nomadic tribes, now may be understood as a socio-economic transformation of the local population—its adaptation to the new environment, to the evolution of society (the increasing role of the animal breeders and shepherds, the development of metallurgy, extended mobility, the increasingly military role of the elites, changes in the belief systems, etc.). In conclusion, the Eneolithic was a period of stability, in which the sedentary populations created a spectacular civilization.  Bronze Age  ;(3200) 2700 – 1100 BC) For a long time the Romanian Bronze Age had been divided into four periods, but the archeological facts have imposed in the last decades the use of a three-part system: Early, Middle and Late Bronze. As communities acquired the secrets of alloying brass and arsenic, tin, zinc, or lead, achieving the first items in bronze, the long period during which stone constituted the main raw material for fashioning implements and weapons was coming to an end. The emergence and development of bronze metallurgy is accompanied by numerous substantial changes in economic and social life, in the spiritual life, and in the arts. The ensemble of these modifications – archeologically identifiable especially midway in the Bronze Age, yet already prefigured early on in the transition period from the Eneolithic to the Bronze Age – indicates a civilization far more sophisticated than we had imagined. = Baden culture, Coţofeni culture = EIEC). The first stage of the Early Bronze Age is a genuine cultural mosaic, juxtaposing transitory civilizations with those typical of the Bronze Age. For the first, the most typical is the Baden – Coţofeni cultural bloc, which perpetuated in many aspects a transitory lifestyle, but evolved in parallel to the pre- Schneckenberg and Schneckenberg civilisations, which were more active in taking over the products of the Aegean-Anatolian Early Bronze. One can no longer speak of Eneolithic or neo-Eneolithic cultures, as defined by this historical period, for the changes occurring in the social structure are radical. The rise in status of the chieftains, indicated by the erection of tumulus funeral monuments, the different type of metallurgy, the different type of economy based on greater mobility as evinced by the impressive number of settlements belonging to the Coţofeni culture. During the second stage, in the center of Transylvania there develops a cultural group bearing the name of the locality of Copăceni (Cluj County), which favored the locations afforded by the elevated sites in the eastern, and probably western, arch of the Western Carpathians and the upper basin of the Someş rivers. Their main pursuits were agriculture, animal breeding and ore extraction. They had surface dwellings, medium-sized (3x4m) with a rectangular layout, and pottery displays mainly high-necked pots with a short bottom portion often decorated with barbotine. Frequently the pots' rims are thickened and decorated with rope impressions. The dead are buried in tumuli such as those at Cheile Aiudului, Cheile Turzii or Cheile Turului. The Copăceni group evolved in parallel to the Şoimuş and Jigodin groups, the former in the south-west, and the latter in south-east Transylvania. Coţofeni culture vessels, stone and bone tools, in display at the National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia Finally, the third stage is the least known, and is characterized by the use of ceramics with brush decorations and textile impressions. Non-ferrous metallurgy in Early Bronze Age, given the substantial fall in production as compared to the Eneolithic, should be regarded as undergoing some sort of realignment, or repositioning, rather than indicating an acute decline. The causes of this phenomenon are many and diverse (exhaustion of the usual mineral sources, major technological changes, disturbing ethnic reshuffling, etc.). Significantly, the first bronze items (brass alloyed with arsenic, and later tin) now emerged. The archeological sites of this period have uncovered more varied jewelry (hair rings, bracelets, necklaces, pendants made in copper, bronze or gold), poniards, flat axes as well as 'raised margin' axes. Yet the most important achievement of the age is the single-edged axe. Apparently the majority of these products were manufactured in local workshops. The proof is the numerous moulds for casting axes discovered at Leliceni (Harghita County) part of the Jigodin group. Hard to ignore is the often evoked ritual hole at Fântânele, part of the Copăceni group, where were found fragments of moulds for casting metal items (little chisels, poniards, massive axes), testifying that the level of the Baniabic/Vâlcele (Cluj County) type of axe had certainly been attained. = Periam-Pecica/Mureş culture = This culture occupied the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. In the diffusion of the archeological cultures on the lower course of the Mureş River, the Periam- Pecica/Mureş culture emerges, bordered in the south by the Vatina culture and in the north (territories in Hungary and Slovakia included), by the Otomani culture; the Transylvanian Plateau was occupied by the Wietenberg culture, which gradually ceded part of its northern area to the Suciu de Sus culture. All of these cultures evolved together, the earliest being evidently the Mureş culture, the Suciu de Sus culture appearing later. Among the five regional cultural groups, the Wietenberg and Otomani cultures occupy a special position. The division into periods, according to the stratigraphy of the sites at Derşida (Sălaj County) and Otomani (Bihor County), represents in addition to that of Sărata Monteoru in Muntenia, the major demarcations of the Romanian Bronze chronology. = Otomani culture = Bronze Age hoard of Cugir, 12th century BC, in display at the National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia The late period of the Bronze Age brings to Transylvania a marked process of cultural uniformity, whose direct manifestation is the local variety of the Noua culture. It is now, too, that the Lăpuş groups spins off the Suciu de Sus culture while the western areas are covered by the Cehăluţ and Igriţa groups. Ceramics are the prehistoric artifacts that have been available in the greatest quantity and variety, thus providing the foundation of all of the above-mentioned cultural classifications. The pattern repertoire of these cultures is abstract and geometric. The Wietenberg, Otomani and Suciu de Sus cultures, regularly and predominantly, displayed dynamically designed solar symbols (continuous spirals, crosses with spirals etc.) in the early stages of their cultural development. The same symbols appeared, in static form, (crosses, spiked wheels, rays, etc.) for the other cultures (Vatina, Mureş). Natural elements occurred rarely, and mainly as figurative art. Most remarkable in this context were the super-elevated handles, shaped into ram heads, of a large size receptacle found south of the Carpathians, at Sărata Monteoru (Buzău County). The motif is repeated in markedly stylized forms on numerous pot handles of the Wietenberg culture. They were abstract to the extent that an animal was represented by a single defining element, for example a ram's horns. The same culture exhibits two rare achievements: a fragment of a cult wagon, exquisitely decorated, with both extremities ending in protomes, shaped as sheep-goat heads, discovered at Lechinţa de Mureş (Mureş County), and a gold axe displaying a fine engraving of a human silhouette next to a bovine silhouette, whose provenance is the thesaurus of Ţufalău (Covasna County). Celt type axes at the Aiud History Museum, Aiud Close scrutiny of the production technique of the more complex vessels—the perfect duct of some complex decoration patterns—strengthens the probability that the ceramics were produced by specialists. This does not exclude the possibility that other social groups, mainly children and adolescents, performed a secondary role. The transport of receptacles over long distances, in the absence of good roads, must have been an equally difficult operation, requiring itinerant craftsmen or special workshops near the more important centers. The partial representations, the schematic physiognomies, as well as the faithful thematic rendering, though rare, all speak of a new symbolic expression that dominated the art of statuettes too. The moulding of the zoomorphic and anthropomorphic statuettes no longer attain the rich realism of the prior epoch, which is explained by the changes occurring in the religious and cult structure of the society. The incised and engraved decorations focus particularly on the details of the costume and the jewelry worn (hair rings, diadems, pendants, necklaces, etc.) The importance of the settlements, as a constructed and limited human space for the prehistoric population, is graphically suggested by Mircea Eliade, when he interprets them as symbolic of the \\"centre of the world\\". The analyzed archeological sites evolved from simple groupings of lodges to complex urban facilities, directed towards maintaining collective lifestyle quality, ensuring the protection of life and goods, and meeting specific social, economic, defense and cultic needs. Thus, there are central sites, with long term developments, epicenters of a larger territory (Derşida, Otomani, etc.), and secondary sites evolving at the level of hamlets or seasonal dwellings (Suatu, Cluj-Napoca, etc.). The Otomani civilization in particular features a marked settlement hierarchy manifested in the ordered positioning of the dwellings, suggesting a pre-urban tendency. For instance, at Otomani – Cetăţuie a circular settlement has been investigated, located on a hilltop and enclosed by a ditch and rampart. The dwellings were distributed in two concentric circles around an empty space at the center. The same organizing system is evident at Sălacea, where a megaron- type sanctuary has been explored. Prior to this century, the Intra-Carpathian space has been predominantly a land of farmers, as well as of craftsmen and animal breeders. In settlements belonging to the classical period of the Bronze Age were found charred seeds, numerous farming implements, grinding mills of diverse types, all attesting the intensive cultivation of grains. The widespread use of a primitive type of plough drawn by oxen is indicated by a great number of plough shares made of deer horn. Wheat, millet, barley, and rye were found in several Bronze Age sites. A Wietenberg ritual complex researched recently at Cluj-Napoca uncovered charred buckwheat, chick-peas and sesame seeds, and the ritual complexes at Oarţa de Sus (Maramureș County) revealed the use of notch weed and sorrel. The animal economy of the Bronze Age, with the familiar local variations, was based on pig, sheep and goat breeding, with a decline in large horned cattle. Thus, the inhabitants of the Vatina and Otomani cultures seem to have focused on breeding swine, sheep, goats, and on intensive hunting; while among the Wietenberg and Noua communities cattle were most common, used both for food and for traction, followed by sheep, goats, swine and horses. Horses were constantly present and revolutionized transportation and communication. The wagon with big wheels, later with spikes, emerged and spread, either as a warring and hunting vehicle, or to symbolize social status. = Monteoru culture = Sărata River in Sărata Monteoru The food provided by agriculture and animal breeding was supplemented by hunting and fishing. Their proportion within the economy varied among the communities of the Bronze Age. For instance, at Sărata Monteoru (the Monteoru culture) they represented 8.11% and at Pecica, of the Mureş culture, 17.95%, in contrast to the area of the Noua culture where the percentage of hunting was, as a rule, much below 3%. Deer remained the most prized game in the Bronze Age, followed by wild boar and roebuck. A larger and more constant flow of the rivers, determined by an increasingly wet climate, is evident from the large fish bones found in many Bronze Age settlements. There is no clear indication whether agriculture or animal breeding predominated within Bronze Age communities, with research revealing that both were being practiced together within the same area. But as populations stabilized, they tended towards a pastoral East and a farm-dominated West. Men became more economically productive, due to improved metallurgy and better animal husbandry, and the use of draught animals in agriculture. Men acquired a dominant position within the family and in society. For the Bronze Age people, the mountains provided hunting, timber and fruit, and held the copper and precious metal ores. Copper, silver and gold have always constituted major assets of the Intra-Carpathian region. The Apuseni Mountains are especially rich, as are the ores in the Maramureşului Mountains, or the copper in the Giurgeului Mountains and Baia de Aramă. Metal outcrops are claimed to have been searched for by specialists, who perhaps then kept them secret. By washing gravel, or by digging pits for nuggets, the ore seekers satisfied the demand of local, prehistoric Europe, and even for the Mycenaean elites. The unique direct proof of prehistoric exploitation of non-ferrous metals in Transylvania is the stone axe found in a gallery in Căraci (Hunedoara County). An impressive anthropomorphous statue was discovered at Baia de Criş (Hunedoara) or Ciceu-Mihăieşti (Bistriţa-Năsăud County). It portrayed implements (pickaxe and basket), whose absolutely sensational analogs were found in the photos of miners, taken by B. Roman at the middle of the last century, strongly suggesting that the mining of non-ferrous metals was also performed underground. Furthermore, the Natural History Museum in Vienna preserves two hair rings with the caption 'Dealul Vulcoi (Roşia Montana), district Câmpeni, region Cluj'. The museum in Lupşa exhibits a miner's axe and a club, both having come from the Lupşei valley. These exhibits demonstrate the presence of prehistoric miners in the ore-rich Apuseni Mountains. Increasingly, traces of people involved in bronze-related activities are found. There are finished or semi-finished items, moulds, deposits or isolated items. The tracks of quarries and work-sheds are rather frail, firstly, because of subsequent exploitation, secondly, because of far too few exhaustive archeological investigations. The little workshop for moulding bronze pieces in the Wietenberg settlement at Derşida is well known. The most complete and spectacular data related to metal processing workshops gathered so far, although partial, come from Palatca (Cluj County), from the Late Bronze Age, where the workshop was in close proximity to the dwelling area. The research has brought to light numerous moulds for casting metal items, unfortunately extremely fragmented, the fragment of a bronze cake, rectangular in shape, with curved sides, a bronze anvil, slag, several fragments of hand- mills, burnt out fireplaces and diverse rocks. Space in the workshop was organized in a complex way, depending on the current activities (selecting and grinding rocks, cutting and melting cakes, casting and retouching items). The presence at Palatca of the plano-convex type bronze cakes and, for the first time ever on Romanian territory, of the Aegean type, as well as the probable absence of metal reduction kilns demonstrate that this operation was performed in the mining areas. Mycenaean bronze sword found at Dumbrăvioara, Mureş County. In display at the National Museum of Transylvanian History, Cluj- Napoca The conversion of minerals to metal by means of fire was a process accompanied by rituals, magic formulas, and chanting to bring about the \\"birth of the metal\\". At the foundation of a kiln at Palatca formed by a burnt out clay fireplace and several slabs of whetstone laid one on top of the other, probably round in shape, a clay vessel had been deposited. Close to the workshop, a large ritual area has been explored. Receptacles with offerings were placed in multiple hypostases next to ore-refining items (hand-mills, bronze items, ash, coal, etc.), underneath or on top of the whetstone slabs, head down or head up. The mass of the ethnographic data which associates the ground with the belly, the mine with the womb, and the ore with the embryo, speaks of the sexuality of the mineral realm, and of the blacksmith's belongings and implements. The production of items is the equivalent of a birth and takes on an obstetrical dimension. The blacksmith's implements have a sexual connotation. The anvils, for instance, are identified with the female principle. In this context, the closeness between the shape of the orifice for setting in place the anvil at Palatca, and the female generating organ was not coincidental. Another unique discovery was the meteorite. Meteorites coming from the skies fell on Earth with a celestial sacred charge and were often associated with the blacksmiths' activity. The scarcity of settlements with metallurgic activity also hints at the possible existence of itinerant artisans and/or the centralization of the activity. This new development in bronze processing denotes a specialization in production with the appearance of prospectors, blacksmiths and merchants, who exported the surplus produce. Through exchange, the Transylvanian and east-Hungarian type axes with spiked discs spread as far east as Bug, and to the north, to the Oder and Elbe region, Pomerania included, a phenomenon connected with The Great Amber Road and the exploitation of brass and tin in the Elbe region. The metal artisans are not in power, but rather work under the control of an elite, which had seen the contingencies between metal and wealth, technology, war and even the social and cultic structure. The first level with gift depositaries consisted in two main themes: the sword and the axe, outlining the role of the two weapons in the Intra-Carpathian warrior. The lance must have been yet another important weapon, but is a lesser find. The characteristics of the period are the bronze deposits at Apa, Satu Mare County (two swords, three war axes and a defense bracer), Ighiu, Alba County (two axes with spiked discs and four defense bracers) and at Săpânţa, Maramureș County (a spiked disc axe of type A2, exquisitely decorated, older than all the other pieces, spiral bracers, arm bands, and cordiform pendants). In the following stage, undecorated bronze items (single-edged axe and spiked disc axe), were produced and stored in ever increasing quantities. Many continued in the earlier style, but were also new types. Among the best creations of Bronze Age metallurgy were the Mycenaean type swords, whose dating is still debated. = Wietenberg culture = Wietenberg culture battle axes found at Valea Chioarului, Maramureș County, Romania. In display at the National Museum of Transylvanian History, Cluj- Napoca The thesaurus found in 1840 at Ţufalău, Covasna County, in the area of the Wietenberg culture, speaks clearly of the wealth and refined tastes of a social elite. Kept in a clay pot, the thesaurus contained several solid gold axes, ornamental phalerae with spiral motifs, hair rings, one bracelet and one large gold piece. A great number of gold and silver items (bracelets, loop rings, etc.) were found at Oarţa de Sus, with accurate stratigraphy, in a ritual space belonging to the Wietenberg culture. Such thesauruses containing hundreds of pieces weighing several kilograms, such as those at Sarasău (Maramureș County) or Hinova (Mehedinţi County), are few and likely to represent the community treasure. They are outnumbered by those displaying fewer items which seem to have been the private property of some leaders. Metal, bone, stone or clay processing were most certainly operations performed by specialists, who worked in small workshops, or sometimes larger ones such as those at Derşida or Palatca. There certainly existed many wooden tools or receptacles, but they have not been preserved. Animal skin processing for fashioning clothing items, shields, harnesses, etc. must have been widespread. The Bronze Age necropoles reveal funeral practices peculiar to each community. The graves, with variations specific to the different cultural entities, by their design and their contents attest to an advanced spiritual culture. Incineration (Wietenberg culture) or inhumation (Noua culture), the placing of offering-items alongside the deceased, all imply abstract thinking and belief in the afterlife. Archeological investigations alone are too few and disparate for a detailed reconstruction of the religions of the Bronze Age people. The solar symbols, dynamic or static in form, (continuing spirals, simple crosses or crosses with spirals, spiked wheels, rays, etc.) are so numerous that they could be illustrated in a separate volume, and speak clearly about the prevailing role of this cult. Pottery, bone and bronze artefacts of the Wietenberg culture. In display at National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia Cultic practices were performed by the people of the Bronze Age in diverse locations: in mountains, trees, springs, rivers, clearings or even, as noted, in specially assigned places inside the settlements. At Sălacea, Bihor County, in the southern area of the settlement of the Otomani culture there was a cultic edifice, a megaron type sanctuary measuring 5.20x8.80m, with a porch with two in antis pillars, a pronaos with an elevated altar and a naos with two fixed altars. The solid crust on the altar surface testifies to the rituals involving fire, while the walls nearby were provided with circular orifices (a ventilating system and alternative lighting of the altars depending on sunrise and sunset). On one of them were found nine clay weights, three curved stone knives, and one cylindrical clay stand. The other had nine clay weights in miniature, three curved stone knives and one cylindrical stand. The symbolic value of the items and their number speak for themselves. The walls were decorated with plaster work with geometrical motifs (spirals, continuing spirals) randomly painted in white. Close by the entrance an infant grave has been researched, possibly partially deposited as an offering. Another founding ritual is encountered in Early Bronze Age at Copăceni, where under the lodge's floorboard were found five human skeletons (one female adult and four fetuses). Judging by their position – the female in an obstetric position with the fetuses around her basin and one between her inferior members – it could well be a mother and her infants. All of these practices, judging by the archeological data mentioned above, as well as being based on other analogies, were accompanied by offerings, libations, chanting and cultic dancing. Apart from some daily festivals (sewing, harvesting, reaping, sheep loss or recovery, etc.), there must have been annual or multi-annual festivals of the whole community, or of part of it. This has been made clear from the above-mentioned research at Oarţa de Sus - Ghiile Botii. The divinities guarding this space were in harmony with the weapons, ornaments or gifts personal or social in nature (grains, plants, food), with the animal, even human, sacrifices, with ceramics and bone, as well as with gold, silver or bronze. This wide variety of offerings, deposited in the course of grand religious ceremonies, indicate either an all-encompassing deity, or else several deities all worshiped within the same space. In the Wietenberg culture area at Cluj-Napoca the underground deposition of offerings in a ritual hole and their contents (numerous receptacles filled with charred seeds) speaks of an agricultural ritual, one which was chthonic, dedicated to a harvest-giving deity ruling fertility. In this case sacred agrarian rituals, whose tradition is evident in the historical epochs too, was intended to inaugurate and imprint a rhythm to the agrarian calendar, and to achieve union between sun and soil through the agrarian ceremonial. The repeated occurrence of the solar motifs covering the walls of the receptacles deposited, typically masculine, might be speaking of the joining of the two spheres: earth-sun, female-male, immobile-mobile, thus demonstrating the dualism of creeds in the Bronze Age. The link between the Carpathian region and the Mediterranean civilizations has often been the subject of debates offering quite divergent opinions concerning their dating, direction and significance. One of the main arguments concerns the bronze swords discovered on the territory of Romania. These long thrusting swords (symbols of dignity and power as well as formidable weapons) are obviously local products executed on southern models. The decorating motifs based on spirals and fine windings on bronze or gold weapons, on bone or horn items, are near to perfection, especially in the areas of the Wietenberg and Otomani cultures. Even if created independently on Aegean models, they cannot be too far removed in time. The glass in the Noua graves at Cluj-Napoca, and the Dentalium beads discovered at Derşida in a Wietenberg milieu, are also of Mediterranean origins. At Oarţa de Sus on the shoulder of one of the cult receptacles are symbols in a line that are most certainly epigraphic. Similar images, also indicating a connection with southern civilizations, are found in the Otomani culture at Barca (Slovakia). Similarly, one of the bronze ingots at Palatca copies the well-known Aegean model. The striking similarities between the Wietenberg ceramics and the Apennine culture in northern Italy are difficult to explain. The assumption made long ago of a common generating center still stands, until final clarification. In the same era, the metals produced on the slopes of the eastern arch of the Western Carpathians arrived in different ways in distant places all over Europe; so did the salt Transylvania is so rich in. Just as the obsidian, most probably exploited in the Bükk Mountains (Hungary), is encountered in the Wietenberg cultic complex discovered at Cluj-Napoca. The amber items in the deposit discovered at the Cioclovina cave came from the Baltic Sea, while the Caucasian influences are indicated by the axe discovered at Larga (Maramureș County). The marked expansion of pan European trade in middle and late Bronze Age created growing dependence between the different cultural groups, and an acceleration of uniformity in cultural values and produce. All of which sped up the general development of society and the passage to a new phase in historical evolution. = Noua culture = The Late Bronze Age shows a marked increase in metallurgic production based on the discovery of new non-ferrous mineral sources and the adoption of upgraded technology. The eastern experience brought by the bearers of the Noua culture and the southern experience (through Central European connections) brought by some late derivatives of the Otomani culture, both grafted onto the undoubted local experience, made Transylvania the most prolific metallurgic center in prehistoric Europe. The differences identified between the deposits of the period speak not of unitary series, but of types of deposits with a more limited geographic spread. One deposit, characterized by the almost exclusive presence of several types of axes, socked axes, bracelets and foot rings, delineates the area of diffusion of the Suciu de Sus culture. The deposits in the area of the post-Otomani groups (Igriţa and Cehăluţ) contain almost exclusively ornament items, mainly pendants and pins. Finally, in central and eastern Transylvania, in the area of the Noua culture, we encounter the third type of deposit with the prevailing Transylvanian type of socked axes and the sickle. Only a small number of bronze items were found in settlements and cemeteries. Most of them have a fortuitous appearance in what we call deposits. Romanian archaeology has interpreted their storage as a proof of troubled times, yet today a new interpretation is gaining ground: they are cultic deposits functioning as offerings, or at times, as the result of prestigious inter-community auctions of the \\"potlatch\\" type. The arguments in favour are strong: long periods of peaceful development, the location of the deposits (confluence of rivers, lakes, springs, clearings, mild slopes looking east, etc.), the number of items, the arrangements, their manipulations (fired, bent, fragmentation through bending, etc.), etc. Moreover, there is no logic in the locals burying their arms in the face of a military threat. Halstatt A1 culture artefacts from Uioara de Sus, accidentally found in 1909. The hoard contains 5827 items weighing approximately 1,100 kg The multiplication of the offensive, in contrast to the defensive, fighting equipment (swords type Boiu – Sauerbrunn, battle axes with spiked disc, daggers, spearheads, arm bracers, all made of bronze), the development of settlements with man-made defenses, the existence of distinct warrior graves, gives the impression that the Bronze Age was a warring world. But there are numerous arguments that it was really a matter of parading rather than using force. The extraordinary non-ferrous mineral wealth of the Intra-Carpathian region has often been remarked upon in the literature. The overwhelming number of finds of copper, bronze, silver and gold products is hard to equal in prehistoric Europe. For instance, no other limited prehistoric space is known to have contained two large deposits dating from the same short range of time (Halstatt A1). Uioara de Sus, accidentally found in 1909, contained 5827 items weighing approximately 1,100 kg, while Şpalnaca II 1,000 paces away, in the year 1887, totaling a weight of 1,000 – 1,200 kg, was composed similarly of thousands of items. In addition to Şpalnaca I, Şpalnaca II, a deposit dated Hallstatt B1, was discovered a short distance away in the year 1881 and consisted of 120 bronze items. The local copper ores often occur together with gold and silver. The gold must have been obtained, both by the washing gravel method in the valleys rich with such ores, as well as through mining the gold ore on the surface, or in shallow veins in ravines or landslides. There is no doubt that the tools and procedures of washing gold-bearing gravel did not differ greatly from those used throughout the ages up to the beginning of the 20th century. A wooden shovel, a vat (a similar clay item was found in one of the tumuli at Lăpuş), a screen, a piece of woolen linen or even a sheep's fleece sufficed. The output was a few grams per day per worker.  Iron Age  ;(1100 BC – 150 AD) The First Iron Age period, also called the Hallstatt (after the finds in the locality of Hallstatt, Austria) covers the 10th to 5th centuries BC (1000-400 BC) and is divided into three periods: early (1000-700 BC), middle (700-600 BC) and late (600-400 BC). The Second Iron Age, also called La Tène, generally covers the period between 450 BC and the peak of Roman Empire. The defining phenomenon of the epoch is the use of iron with a paramount impact on humanity's subsequent evolution. = Geto-Dacians = The Helmet of Coţofeneşti - a full gold Geto-Dacian helmet dating from the first half of the 4th century BC, currently at the National Museum of Romanian History In contrast to the heterogeneity of the preceding ages, the first Iron Age is remarkable for its homogeneity, which is the result of the emergence and generalization of a new culture displaying black ceramics ornamented with grooves. This cultural homogenization in the First Iron Age represents essentially the material proof of the constitution within the Carpathian Danubian space of the early Geto-Dacians, who are culturally distinguishable from the southern Thracians and the other neighboring peoples. We are told this by the father of history himself—Herodotus. Recounting the Persian king Darius’ expedition to the mouth of the Danube in 514 BC he mentions the Getae, praising them for their valour. Over 600 sites are known so far across the territory of Transylvania from the First Iron Age. Most sites were occupied during all stages of this epoch. Twenty-six fortifications, some inhabited permanently, others used for refuge and defense in times of peril, are among the more remarkable. The fortified settlements and the refuge fortifications were usually located on inaccessible elevations and close to water courses and fertile areas. Their sizes vary with the location and its possibilities. For instance, the fortified settlement at Sântana (Arad County) with an area of approximately 100 hectares or those at Ciceu-Corabia (Bistriţa-Năsăud County) and Teleac (Alba County), each measuring 30 hectares, count among the largest in Europe. The first Iron Age fortifications are also known in the county of Cluj, in Dej, Huedin and Someşul Rece. The sanctuaries at Sarmizegetusa Regia, the capital of ancient Dacia The defense systems surrounding these regular strongholds consisted of a ditch, rampart and palisade, the last of which was designed as a wooden wall erected on the ridge of the rampart representing the most important part of the system. So designed, the fortifications generally measured 7–8 m in height, but could reach 10-12 making them difficult to conquer. As tribal centers, the fortified settlements had multiple functions, the foremost of which was to ensure the defense of the community. The discovery of metallurgical workshops for manufacturing tools indicates that the settlements housed skilled craft activities, which included permanent exchange relations. Agriculture was still the main pursuit in the First Iron Age and supplied food for the communities. Finding charred seeds indicates the cultivation of wheat, barley, rye, millet, as well hemp for linen, while the large size pots and the storage pits indicate how the harvests were preserved. The emergence of the first iron farming implements, scythes and grubbing hoes, indicate notable progress in the agricultural practice. The large quantity of bones discovered in the settlements, most originating from domestic animals, cattle, sheep, swine—as well as game—indicate the importance of domestic animals to supplement hunting, as well as the importance of meat in the daily diet. Finally, besides some such crafts as metallurgy which imply special skill, members of every family engaged in a series of activities such as weaving, spinning, and leather dressing, shown by the discovery in the dwellings of spindle, spools, sewing needles, and scrapers for cleaning hide. The occurrence of decorations on a large number of vessels, the most perishable of categories, as well as on numerous body ornaments (hair pins, fibulae and others) shows that in the First Iron Age the artistic phenomenon was manifested especially in decorative art as geometric patterns. Dacian blacksmith workshop including tongs, sledgehammer, bellows, anvil. In display at the Orăştie Ethnography Museum, Orăştie Religion was demonstrably a daily presence in prehistoric communities. Thus, besides the magic practice and the fertility cult of ancient tradition, the depositing of offerings in appropriate ground holes, as well as the representations linked to the Sun cult, foreshadow the two components: chtonian and Urano-solar to become the characteristics of the Geto-Dacian religion in the classical period. During the First Iron Age, the local culture was influenced by neighboring areas. Midway through the epoch, on the middle course of the Mureş River there arrived from Banat elements of a culture called Basarabi. Displaying ceramics with specific decorations (incised and impressed), the culture was assimilated by the autochthonous background. Subsequently, at the beginning of the late period of this epoch (6th century BC), a group of Scythian-Iranian extraction came into Transylvania from the direction of the North-Pontic. This group is marked by a series of inhumation graves with a typical inventory: arrow heads, lances called akinakai, and animal art representations. Research shows that in about the mid-5th century BC this group disappears through assimilation into the local culture. Actually, the end of the century also delimits the First Iron Age. During the following centuries the Geto-Dacians would attain a level of development that would lead them to form a state.

The larvae are full grown in October and early November, producing adults in May and June of the following year. The larvae feed on Quercus palustris. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The larva forms a characteristic oval spiral mine in the bark of young branches of pin oak. The mine is a narrow linear track, closely coiled in a flattened oval spiral, resembling a watch spring. The empty egg shell often remains attached to the bark in the center of the mine after the larva has deserted the mine. The bark of old mines cracks and often breaks away entirely, leaving the inner bark exposed, producing scars which persist for a number of years.

October 1983) is a South Korean underwater diving instructor who was held in Honduras. She was jailed for 110 days and was placed under house arrest for 306 days in connection with the death of Dutch tourist Mariska Mast at the Honduran island of Roatán. Han proclaimed her innocence and appealed to roommate Daniel Ian Ross, a suspect in the case who fled to Australia, to come forward and exonerate her. Han's uncle Sung-ho Choi filed petitions for her release with Amnesty International. The case was brought to the attention of South Korean president Lee Myung-bak and Honduran president Porfirio Lobo Sosa. On October 16, 2010, Han was acquitted of the murder and remains in Honduras pending the outcome of an appeal by the prosecution. Background Han lived in the West End district of Roatán while training to be a Divemaster. Han came to Roatán on June 10, 2008 to learn to become a scuba diving instructor. She assisted instructor Daniel Ian Ross, then 29 years old, in the course of her PADI Divemaster training at Coconut Tree Divers. She moved into Ross' apartment in the West End district on August 15 to save money by sharing the rent. Ross, a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Australia, allegedly arrived in March of that year and may have been working illegally in Roatán at that time. Death of Mariska Mast On August 21, 2008, 23-year-old Mariska Esmeralda Mast, a schoolteacher from the Netherlands, took a diving course at Coconut Tree Divers with Ross and other instructors. Han said she was preparing for her instructor exam outside of the dive shop at that time. Mast's travel companion Barbara Mehsner stated that Mast complained of having breathing problems after their last dive. According to Han, she met Mast for the first time that evening at the Purple Turtle bar, while accompanied by Ross and other guests. Mehsner said Mast drank with Ross that night and was infatuated with him; Mast told Mehsner that Ross had kissed her. Han stated that she went home alone at around 11:30 p.m. to go to sleep. Ross and Mast arrived at the apartment minutes later. In Ross' statement to police, Mast collapsed in the bathroom at around 3 a.m., hitting her head and chipping her tooth. Han said she brought some ice to tend to a cut above Masts' eye and returned to bed after Ross said he could handle the situation. Han allegedly woke up at around 6 a.m. when Ross yelled her name because Mast was having trouble breathing. Han said Mast was naked in Ross' bed and had defecated on herself. Han alerted neighbors to call for an ambulance. Ross said that he attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation when Mast stopped breathing. Han joined Ross to take Mast to the hospital in the back of the landlady's truck. Ross alleged that he was unable to converse in Spanish with the doctors, who sent him away. Mehsner said she was told that Mast hit her head when she fell in the apartment. Ross stated that he returned to the apartment where he \\"cleaned up the mess\\" with the housekeeper and claimed to be unaware that he was removing vital evidence because Mast had been pronounced dead. According to the police, the landlady witnessed Ross cleaning up the scene before they could arrive. Han said that a neighbor's wife had cleaned the apartment, which was sealed as a crime scene. A police officer who inspected the apartment found \\"six packets of pills and a blood stain.\\" =Initial investigation= Ross was arrested and held for five days at a Coxen Hole jail, where he was visited by British consul Mat Harper. Ross told the court that he did not want Mast to come to his apartment on the night she died. British officials in Honduras stated that Mast's initial autopsy was \\"inconclusive\\" and were uncertain whether Ross would be charged. Han was summoned to the court to make a statement and answer questions as a witness. Ross was conditionally released after surrendering his British passport and was instructed not to leave the island by the Honduran authorities, who were then unaware of his dual citizenship. Ross used his Australian passport to leave the country the next day, while a memorial was being held for Mast. Han said she had not seen Ross since. Dutch diplomats and private investigators visited Roatán and pressured Honduran investigators to revisit the case. A new forensic report stated that Mast died of blunt force injuries and asphyxiation with evidence of strangulation. Trace amounts of amphetamines were found in her blood. Honduran forensic pathologist Heybee Yessenia Caballero reported that Mast's bruises were consistent with defensive injuries and concluded her death was a \\"homicide, from the legal medical point of view.\\" An international arrest warrant was issued for Ross through Interpol. According to Han, she passed her Divemaster certification about a month after the incident and left Roatán. After staying in the United States for about three weeks, she returned to South Korea. At the end of December 2008, Han went to Dahab, Egypt where she taught diving to other Koreans. =Arrest and extradition= On August 27, 2009, Han was detained at Cairo International Airport on an Interpol warrant as she was leaving Egypt to return to Korea. After questioning by an Interpol inspector, Han said she was sent to a \\"chicken cage\\" jail cell in Cairo where she had to sleep on a concrete floor. Han said that her request to contact the Korean consulate in Egypt was denied. Three days after Han's arrest, Ross fled from Singapore to Australia, which does not have an extradition treaty with Honduras, and denied responsibility for the death through his lawyers. Australian authorities will not honor an Interpol red notice, which requests extradition. On September 22, 2009, Han was extradited back to Roatán via the Netherlands while in Interpol custody. After a short court hearing which Han said she did not understand, she was sent to La Ceiba prison. Han said she was scared of the prison shop \\"because there are a lot of rapists amongst the males.\\" Han praised her father who visited her at the prison and befriended the guards to make sure that she was treated well. On December 14, 2009, Han was released from the prison on $10,000 bail and has been allowed to remain under house arrest at a church in San Pedro Sula until her trial. =Media coverage and reaction= Han publicly appealed to Ross to come forward and exonerate her. Mariska's father Herbert Mast also pleaded with West Australian authorities to extradite Ross to answer questions about the case. Mariska's sister Amanda said that Ross never contacted the Mast family to explain what had happened. Ross stated that he wanted to get on with his life and asked for privacy. Han's uncle Sung-ho Choi called the charges \\"total nonsense\\" and filed petitions with Amnesty International to seek his niece's release. On June 29, 2010, South Korean president Lee Myung-bak met with Honduran president Porfirio Lobo Sosa at the 2010 summit of the Central American Integration System (SICA) and brought up Han's case, stating: \\"A young Korean woman is on trial in Honduras. I hope you will pay special attention to the issue.\\" Dutch journalist Peter R. de Vries attempted to interview Daniel Ian Ross in Australia about the case. In August 2010, Dutch crime reporter Peter R. de Vries traveled to Subiaco, Western Australia to interview Ross about the case. Ross called the police when De Vries attempted to contact him at his home on August 19. De Vries was arrested and paid a $200 fine for disobeying a police order to move on. De Vries responded to the arrest by stating: \\"I didn't touch him, I didn't insult him, I didn't threaten him... This is a homicide case and I tracked him down and now you're putting me in jail. That's the world upside down.\\" On September 6, a West Australian magistrate rejected an application by Ross for a restraining order against De Vries, who had by then left the country. On November 14, De Vries aired a 3 hour investigative program about the case on Dutch television. A follow-up report aired on November 22, 2010. The dive community and police have presented several theories for Mast's death, including injuries sustained from her accidental fall, decompression sickness mixed with alcohol, battery during an attempted rape, or an accident during rough sex. =Trial= Han's trial was scheduled to be held at Coxen Hole on October 14 to 15 in 2010. The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade sent a diplomat and a forensic expert from the Korean National Institute for Scientific Investigation to assist with the case. Han was defended by attorney Félix Antonio Ávila Ortíz against charges that could have imprisoned her for up to 30 years in Honduras. An additional autopsy report was submitted by Han's defense that indicated that Mast's death may have been caused by a combination of alcohol and drugs. On October 16, Han was found not guilty in a unanimous verbal ruling by a three-judge panel of the regional court of Roatán. However, the formal hearing to release Han was postponed on November 5 and again on November 19. The official verdict acquitting Han was finally delivered on November 24, 2010. The prosecution has appealed the ruling, though Korean ministry officials believe it unlikely to be overturned. Herbert Mast said that he was not shocked by the verdict. Han plans to return to South Korea. After the verdict was announced, Daniel Ian Ross announced through his lawyer from Australia that he was \\"delighted\\" that the court case supported his claim that he was not responsible for the death of Mariska Mast. However, Honduran authorities are still seeking Ross for questioning over Mast's death in his apartment. Dutch consul Floris Kluck stated that authorities from Honduras and the Netherlands were working with Australia on a proposal to extradite Ross without a treaty.

Centrally placed in the old town, it attracts large numbers of locals and visitors, especially in the summer months. It originally served as a parade ground for the troops defending the city. History After a huge fire in 1554 destroyed a large part of the Ville Haute, plans were made to lay out a square in the centre of the fortified town. The task was assigned to the Dutch military engineer Sebastian van Noyen who designed the first version of the square, then known as the Neumarkt, or New Market. In 1671, the Spanish engineer Jean Charles de Landas, Count of Louvigny, produced a slightly smaller square at the same location. It became known as the Place d'Armes as it was used as a parade ground for the garrison. Under Louis XIV, it was paved with flagstones and bordered with lime trees.Jean-Pierre Koltz, \\"Baugeschichte der Stadt und Festung Luxemburg, Vol I.\\".

He is best known for his 1663 play The Adventure of Five Hours, possibly co-authored by George Digby – the play (an adaptation of a Spanish work by Antonio Coello) was produced by the Duke's Company and later proved an influence on Richard Brinsley Sheridan's opera The Duenna. Life The third son of George Tuke, Samuel was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1635 and had fought in Europe before the Civil War broke out in 1640. By late 1642 he was a major in the Duke of York's Regiment, serving with William Cavendish's northern army and fighting at the battle of Marston Moor. He then served in western England in 1645 under the command of George Goring before resigning his commission after he was passed over for promotion to major-general of horse in favour of Goring's brother-in-law George Porter. He tried to force Porter into a duel but the council of war instead forced him into an apology. He then defended Colchester in 1648, acting as one of its occupants' commissioners on the surrender and then going into exile with Prince Charles (later Charles II) in France throughout the Protectorate. There he met John Evelyn,Diary of John Evelyn, 2.8 attended on Charles's younger brother Henry Stuart and became known as a duellist and a wit. He tried to become Henry's governor but instead was recommended to Charles as James, Duke of York's secretary by their mother Queen Henrietta Maria, though Charles and Edward Hyde vetoed such an appointment. By 1659 at the latest Tuke had also converted to Roman Catholicism. On the Restoration, Tuke remained a favourite of Charles II, who made him a knight and a baronet in 1664. He was also sent to the French court in 1661 with Charles's condolences for the death of Cardinal Mazarin. 1661 also saw the first edition of his play The Adventures of Five Hours - this was based on the Spanish comedy Los empeños de seis horas, which Charles II had suggested Tuke adapt and produce in English. Its premiere was on 8 January 1663 at Lincoln's Inn Fields - this was attended by Samuel Pepys, who called it \\"the best, for the variety and the most excellent continuance of the plot to the very end, that ever I saw or think ever shall\\" Pepys, Diary, 4.8, writing in 1663 and \\"the best play that ever I read in my life\\",Diary of Samuel Pepys, ed. Wheatley, 5.403, writing in 1666 thinking it superior to Othello. A catalogue of publications of Henry Herringman published in 1684 also mentions Tuke as one of the authors of the 1664 Pompey the Great. He was one of the first members of the Royal Society (publishing a history of the breeding of green Colchester oysters in the Transactions of the Royal Society) and backed loyal Catholics in the house of Lords (advocating their claims to remission of the penal laws). He died in 1674 at Somerset House and was buried in its chapel. Marriage and issue He married twice: #in 1664, to Mary Guldeford (died 1666) #in 1668, to Mary Sheldon (died 1705, Portugal), a dresser to Charles II's queen Catherine of Braganza – she was accused of interfering with a witness to the Popish Plot in 1679 and after Charles's death returned to Portugal with Catherine in 1692. The couple's children included Charles Tuke (1671–1690), the eldest son, who died of wounds sustained at the Battle of the Boyne whilst fighting on the Jacobite side as a captain in Tyrconnell's Horse.

Wall Street Journal - 30 September 2010 is a Hindu religious denomination. It is one of the fourteen akharas recognized by the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad and belongs to the Vaishnava sampradaya. History Nirmohi Akhara was established by Ramananda. It is a wealthy sect that owns many temples and mathas in the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Bihar. Members are expected to lead simple and austere lives of celibacy and to accept Rama as their deity. They have renounced the material world for the company of Rama. They are sadhus, Vedic holy men often given to asceticism. New recruits are mainly in their teens and can be from any Indian caste. They are put through a grueling schedule to master the Vedic scriptures (Vedas and Upanishads) as well as certain martial arts. In former times, members of the sect had a mandate to provide protection to the followers of Rama and were given rigorous training in archery, swordsmanship, and wrestling. Portions of this curriculum are still observed, though it is more moderate in practice. Certain adherents have garnered public attention, since 1949, in connection with the Ayodhya debate, when a suit was filed on their behalf to reclaim the disputed site of the Babri Mosque. They have claimed in court that there is no mosque referred to as \\"Babri Masjid\\" at the disputed site in Ayodhya. Lawsuits Nirmohi Akhara filed a suit in 1985 with the sub-judge of Ayodhya, seeking consent to construct a temple to Rama in the Ram Chabutra, the area adjacent to the unauthorised structure. The sub-judge held that two large religious structures in close proximity could potentially be a \\"threat\\" to public order. Permission was denied by the court, though the Nirmohi Akhara has since kept up its effort to reclaim the land and construct the temple. In 1989, the Nirmohi Akhara filed a lawsuit against the Uttar Pradesh State government, claiming that they had been worshiping the deities installed at a temple at the then disputed site since ancient times, and requesting the Court to hand the management of the temple over to them. On 30 September 2010, a Lucknow panel of three judges of the Allahabad High Court pronounced the verdict on the case, deciding to give a third part of the land to each party, namely the Sunni Waqf Board, Ram-Lalla Deity, and the Nirmohi Akhara. The Ram-Lalla Deity retained its present position and the Nirmohi Akhara received the areas referred to as the Sita Rasoi and Ram Chabutara. However, on 9 November 2019, the Full Bench of the Supreme court, which included the Chief Justice of India, overturned the Verdict of the Allahabad High Court and dismissed the suit filed by the Nirmohi Akhara stating that the suit of the Akhara was time barred and beyond limitation. The Supreme Court ruled that the outer and inner sanctum of the site would belong to the deity itself and would be managed by a Trust formed by the Central Government for that very purpose. the disputed site which was in the receivership of the Government was directed to the handed over to the trust by an appropriate notification. The Central Government was directed to give appropriate representation to the Nirmohi Akhara in the trust if the same was deemed necessary and appropriate by the Central Government.

It was originally published by Henry Holt in January 1914. The novel is about a group of men shipwrecked on an island occupied by winged- women. Angel Island was reprinted in the February 1949 issue of Famous Fantastic Mysteries, and again in 1978 by Arno Press. In 1988 it was republished by Plume as a \\"classic of early feminist literature\\" with an introductory essay by science fiction and fantasy author Ursula K. Le Guin. Plot summary Five men are shipwrecked on an island in the Pacific Ocean while en route from America to the Orient. They are the only survivors, and their chances of being rescued are remote as a storm had driven their ship into uncharted waters before smashing it against rocks. The island is 20 miles long by 7 miles wide, and densely wooded with a freshwater lake in the center. After coming to terms with their predicament, the men begin collecting what they can from washed-up wreckage from the ship: food, clothes, tools and materials. They start building a camp near the beach and bemoan the fact that they are stuck on an island without women. But as the weeks pass, they begin the relish the absence of women and call the island an \\"Eveless Eden\\". Then one day the men start seeing what look like huge birds flying high in the sky, but when the \\"birds\\" come closer they realise that they are five beautiful winged-women. Suddenly the men are interested in women again and change the island's name to \\"Angel Island\\". Over time the women gradually come closer and start following the men around, who quickly fall in love with the women and name them Julia (their leader), Lulu, Chiquita, Clara and Peachy. But the men become frustrated by the women's aloofness and how easily they frighten, and decide to capture them, saying that they need pampering and protection. Once caught the men subdue the frightened women and cut off their wings. The women, who cannot walk on their small, delicate feet, are now completely helpless. The men quickly win their hearts by showering them with gifts and attention, and teach them English. The men and women pair off and four of them marry; Julia resists this temptation. With the women now domesticated, the men start paying less attention to them and spend long periods inland building a new camp near the lake. The women, who cannot fly, nor walk any distance, are stuck in the camp near the beach. With plenty of time on their hands, the women reminisce on how it was when they could fly. Back home, the five women, led by Julia, had rebelled when their people decided to migrate south, and flew north instead. They found Angel Island, deserted and inviting. Then the men came and the women were fascinated by these wingless creatures. They followed them, teased them, and then made the mistake of falling in love with them, resulting in their capture. The women long to fly again, but the men keep their wings clipped. Soon each of the women bears a child, four wingless boys, and a winged-girl, Angela. As Angela grows up she starts flying and the women are delighted. The men, however, are not so happy and announce that when Angela is older they will cut her wings. The women have accepted their own fate, but decide to put aside their \\"appealing helplessness\\" and stand up for Angela. While the men are working at the new camp each day, the women teach themselves how to walk. When their feet are strong enough, they trek to the new camp one day, unannounced and much to the surprise of the men. Julia presents the men with an ultimatum, let Angela keep her wings, or they will leave the island with the children. The men laugh and remind them that they cannot fly. But the women, with wing stumps that have grown since their last clipping, take off and fly (not very gracefully) over the lake. The men, horrified at the prospect of losing their women, beg them to return and promise not to cut Angela's wings. Things change on Angel Island, and the men have a new respect for the women. Not only do they honor their promise about Angela's wings, they stop clipping the women's wings. Julia decides to marry and her final triumph comes years later on her death bed when she gives birth to a son with wings. Major characters Angel Island was reprinted in the February 1949 issue of Famous Fantastic Mysteries ;The ship-wrecked men: *Frank Merrill – self-appointed leader of the men; a professor of a small mid- West university and a solitary person; believes women should not receive any special treatment *Honey Smith – a businessman in partnership with Billy Fairfax; not that smart but very popular, particularly with women; believes women should be spoiled and pampered *Pete Murphy – an Irish writer, clever, but has a weakness for women's charm; believes women are angels and should be worshipped *Billy Fairfax – a businessman in partnership with Honey Smith; lacking charm, but in possession of a huge fortune; believes women should be cherished and protected *Ralph Addington – a salesman with a strong personality; tends to be course and arrogant; believes women should be tamed, subjugated and controlled ;The winged-women, named by the men: *Julia – Billy Fairfax's wife and leader of the women; silver winged and \\"heroic\\" and \\"clear- sighted\\"; dubbed \\"the quiet one\\" by the men *Lulu – Honey Smith's wife; orange winged and \\"chattering\\"; dubbed \\"the plain one\\" *Chiquita – Frank Merrill's wife; scarlet winged and \\"lazy\\" and \\"voluptuous\\"; dubbed \\"the dark one\\" *Clara – Pete Murphy's wife; green and gold winged and \\"excitement-craving\\"; dubbed \\"the thin one\\" *Peachy – Ralph Addington's wife; blue winged and \\"poetic\\"; dubbed \\"the peachy one\\" Reception and analysis A 1914 review in The New York Times described Angel Island as \\"a decidedly unusual book\\" saying that it is \\"part allegory, part fairy tale, part realistic\\". The review praised Gillmore for her treatment of the sexes, saying that she does not disparage one at the expense of the other. It added that much of the text is on a \\"high poetic level\\", and that it is a novel of \\"sound, prosaic truths\\" and \\"high ideals and beautiful imaginings\\". Science fiction and fantasy author Ursula K. Le Guin, in her introduction to the 1988 edition of the book, reminded the reader that at the time of its original publication in 1914, women could not vote. She wrote that the book is a \\"real discovery\\", and described it as \\"romantic, satiric, funny, fanciful, and a good read\\". Eric Leif Davin in Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926–1965 described Angel Island is a \\"radical feminist Swiftian fantasy\\". Angel Island's entry in Science-fiction, the Early Years called it as a \\"sexual Robinsonade with a strong element of allegory\\". It said that while on the surface the novel is \\"commercial desert-island fiction\\", it is an allegorical story of women's freedom. Andrea Kempf wrote in Shared Lives: Women Who Wrote for Women that Gillmore's book, using wings as a metaphor, \\"soars\\". Kempf said that while Gillmore's men and women are stereotypes, the women rise above their moodiness and rebel when their children are threatened. In Utopian and Science Fiction by Women: Worlds of Difference Jane L. Donawerth felt that she is not convinced of Julia's \\"greatest glory\\" at the end of Angel Island. She said that Julia is the \\"strongest, smartest character\\" in the novel, but felt that when she decides to marry, she too became domesticated. A reviewer of the book at Feminist Science Fiction, Fantasy, & Utopia said that as \\"a fantasy written by a feminist\\", Angel Island is important, but felt that the women were too complicit in their own mistreatment. The novel's stereotypic typecasting of men (aggressive with intellectual drive) and women (vain and coy) appear \\"jarring and sexist to modern readers\\", but those were the \\"unstated assumptions of 19th century US\\", and the women on Angel Island confront and overcome them. The reviewer concluded that it is a worthwhile read because of its \\"subtle liberal feminist insistence that regardless of our gender, we all have a right to fulfil our potential – to fly\\".

The police investigation turns up that Bellamy has been paying 40 pounds per month to Creager. Bellamy claims it was because Creager saved his life once. At night, the Green Archer appears in Bellamy's bedroom but Bellamy wakes up and drives him off with his pistol, wounding him in the process. A blood covered handkerchief with the initials \\"V.H.\\" is found. It turns out that Bellamy keeps Valerie's mother Elaine imprisoned in the basement of his castle. She thinks both her son and daughter are dead. Valerie Howett learns from Bellamy's embezzling secretary Julius Savini, whom she has been paying for information, that Bellamy has contacted one Coldharbour Smith. He lived near her mother when she disappeared and now runs the Shanghai Bar. Valerie visits the bar and a confrontation ensues that is only ended by the arrival of Holland. Valerie next tries to sneak into Garre Castle at night. When she is threatened by Bellamy's dogs, one of them is shot and killed by the Green Archer. Meanwhile, Inspector Featherstone of Scotland Yard has infiltrated the Bellamy household by hiring on as a member of the staff. His suspicions are aroused and a search of the castle is initiated. Nothing incriminating is found, however. Valerie is kidnapped by Lacy, one of Bellamy's men, pretending to be a police officer and driven to the Shanghai Bar. Savini recognizes the man and follows them. There is a police raid at the bar, but Valerie has already been taken away via a secret exit to a freighter ship called \\"Calliope\\". A police search of the ship fails to turn up anything, as Valerie is hidden in a concealed compartment. Savini manages to climb on board the ship, but is captured. Smith is killed by the Archer. Savini and Valerie escape. Next day, when Bellamy opens the secret door he is overseen by the police. They go into the cellar, but the woman Bellamy held there is gone. The police leave. Bellamy tricks Savini and his wife and locks them into the basement. Whilst phoning Featherstone, Valerie is kidnapped by the Archer and taken via a secret passage to the dungeon beneath Garre Castle. Featherstone arrives and is captured, too. Bellamy reveals that his brother stole his girlfriend from him. To take revenge, he locked her up and had her son sent to prison where he was tortured by prison guard Creager. Bellamy attempts to drown his prisoners by flooding the cellar. The police arrive at Garre Castle and a shootout with Bellamy and his henchmen ensues. Bellamy is shot and killed by the Archer. An explosive device used by the police then inadvertently kills the Archer - he is discovered to be \\"John Wood\\", who is actually John Bellamy, Valerie's brother. He was on a crusade of revenge against those who were responsible for his incarceration and torture: Bellamy, Smith and Creager. The prisoners are freed. Bellamy's dead butler is discovered to also wear a green suit under his clothes. There were thus two Green Archers, one of them doing Bellamy's bidding, one trying to destroy him. According to Featherstone, Valerie's mother is safe.

The script for the German version was written by Wolfgang Schnitzler (aka ) with contributions by Wolfgang Menge. This was the first Rialto film produced by Horst Wendlandt who was previously employed by Artur Brauner's CCC Film. This was Jürgen Roland's second (after The Crimson Circle ) and last film based on a Wallace novel. It was the fourth Wallace film made by Rialto. Cinematography took place from October 1960 to January 1961. Interiors were filmed at Real Film's Wandsbek Studios in Hamburg, four later films from the series were also shot there. Exteriors were filmed at Hamburg and at Schloss Ahrensburg. The film's sets were designed by the art directors Mathias Matthies and Ellen Schmidt, who frequently collaborated. Release The FSK gave the film a rating of 12 years and up, unsuitable for screening on public holidays. It went on mass release on 3 February 1961, but there was no premiere. =Critical response= Commentary on the acting generally concluded that Fröbe dominated his fellow actors. The Lexikon des Internationalen Films called the film \\"nicely spooky- comical, stuffed with clichés of the genre. Foggy streets, mysterious castles, trap doors, masked murderers and avengers, criminal types in dive bars and secret passages. Amusing entertainment.\\" See also * The Green Archer (1925, film serial) * The Green Archer (1940, film serial) References External links  1961 films 1960s mystery thriller films German mystery thriller films West German films German-language films Films based on works by Edgar Wallace Films directed by Jürgen Roland Films produced by Horst Wendlandt Films shot in Hamburg Films set in England Films set in London German black-and-white films American film remakes Films shot at Wandsbek Studios Constantin Film films ","title":"The Green Archer (1961 film)"},{"id":"29003451","text":"Video of the ECH U.S. Marine wearing an ECH in 2018 The Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) is a United States Army program to replace the combat helmets of the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines using thermoplastics instead of the ballistic fibers used on the current generation combat helmets. The term \\"Enhanced Combat Helmet\\" was originally coined by Army Lieutenant Colonel William R. Schaffer. Later it's going be replaced by the Integrated Head Protection System.  Design  The ECH's profile is very similar to the Advanced Combat Helmet but is thicker; they can be identified due to the different chinstrap they use compared to the ACH. The ECH helmet's shell is made of an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene material. It is required to provide 35% better protection against small-arms fire and fragmentation than the Advanced Combat Helmet. The helmet is also required to protect against certain rifle projectiles. The helmet is of the \\"tactical cut\\" type and thus offers less coverage but does enable better mobility. The helmet will be compatible with camouflage fabric helmet covers. The replacement of the Advanced Combat Helmet with the Enhanced Combat Helmet has been likened to the transition from the HMMWV to the MRAP. The helmet has been shown nearly impenetrable to fragments fired by test guns. In a v50 test, guns were unable to attain the velocity required to get 50% of the fragments through a helmet. The helmet has exceeded the 35% ballistic improvement requirement. The helmet's design allows for the addition of devices such as communications and night-vision equipment. The Army is planning on using the existing pads used on the Advanced Combat Helmet for the ECH. A single pad that cushions the entire helmet may be developed. The ECH has a 4-point chinstrap/napestrap head retention system. The Marine/Navy and Army variants are differentiated in that the Marine/Navy version uses an X-Back retention system (called the Class I) and the Army uses the H-Back retention system (called the Class II).  Development  In an effort led by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, ECH development began in 2007 under the Army Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program. Solicitations were accepted in late April until early June 2009. In July, more than $8 million was awarded to four vendors for five helmet designs in July 2009. Mine Safety Appliances was awarded $4.7 million, Gentex Corporation was awarded $1.8 million, BAE Systems Aerospace & Defense Group was awarded $764,000, and 3M subsidiary Ceradyne was awarded $729,000. Testing in September revealed that each helmet failed in ballistic and/or blunt force tests. In February 2010 the Navy joined the program and issued their own requirements. Marine Corps officials suggested design improvements such as better materials to industry and testing resumed in June 2010. Three vendors were to be downselected and the remaining two would be tested in November. If the program proceeded as planned the Army would acquire 200,000, the Marine Corps would acquire 38,500, and the Navy would acquire 6,700. Ceradyne won the competition to produce the Enhanced Combat Helmet in March 2012. On 16 July 2013, the U.S. Marine Corps ordered 3,850 helmets for deployed Marines, to be fielded before the end of 2013. The Marine Corps plans to buy 77,000 helmets, enough to outfit a large contingent of deployed U.S. Marines. When they return, they will be turned in. The Lightweight Helmet and Modular Integrated Communications Helmet will still be used for training and noncombat purposes. PEO Soldier also confirmed that the Army will field the helmet. Fielding was scheduled to begin after the start of FY 2014 on 1 October 2013.New combat helmets coming for deploying Marines - MarineCorpstimes.com, 29 July 2013Army, Marines to Field Better Ballistic Helmets - Military.com, 30 July 2013 The Marine Corps' ultimate goal is to issue the ECH to all 182,000 Marines.Corps Needs Cash to Field New Helmet to All Marines - Kitup.Military.com, 14 September 2016 Prior to enhancements under ManTech, every ballistic helmet in the U.S. military used a thermoset-based combination of aramid fiber with a PVB-phenolic resin. Although there have been improvements in the aramid fibers, the material and processing technology in the Army Combat Helmet (ACH) had not changed in 30 years. The ManTech program focused on addressing technology barriers that inhibited a new class of improved ballistic materials, including new grades of Dyneema, Spectra, and thermoplastic coated aramids. The Army helmet fabrication goal was to develop an entirely new methodology for mass producing complex shapes and combining layers of different thermoplastic materials. During this time, ARL and partners created a new molding technology, which included a manufacturing process reducing labor by 40% and waste by 70%. Other helmets from the ManTech program are already in the field and used by the Green Berets, the Navy SEALS, and Special Operations Forces. These include the Future Assault Shell Technology (FAST) and MARITIME helmet. The FAST helmet offers 25% weight reduction, while the MARITIME helmet offers a 35% weight reduction. The helmet technology includes new manufacturing processes developed at ARL, in collaboration with U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development And Engineering Center and Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier. ARL and its partners received DoD’s Manufacturing Technology Program Achievement Award in 2009 for work on ECH.

The manga ran in the monthly magazine Young King OURs from March 30, 2005, to October 28, 2016, and was collected into sixteen bound volumes in Japan. An anime television series adaptation by Shaft was broadcast from October 8, 2010 to December 24, 2010. The series follows the exploits of whiny Hotori Arashiyama, her friends, family, neighbors, shopkeepers and colleagues at the local maid café. The typical slice of life format is occasionally interspersed with stories dealing with aliens, ghosts and the paranormal. Characters =Main characters= ; : :Born on May 10. Hotori is the clumsy, whiny and happy-go-lucky but mostly good-natured and well- meaning main protagonist of the series. Arguably the most well-known teenager in town, she is very knowledgeable of all there is worth knowing about in their community. Possessing a face of childlike innocence, older townsfolk treat Hotori as a granddaughter while toddlers are effortlessly amused much to her annoyance. She is a huge fan of detective fiction and mystery novels; her deep dislike of mathematics stems from her belief that it offers little value for aspiring detectives such as herself. These unusual interests put her at odds against her math teacher (she has good grades in all her other subjects) and the town's patrolling police officer (she has vigilante tendencies). After being reminded by the Maid Seaside Café owner of all the free curry meals she enjoyed there as a child, Hotori began working part-time in the restaurant. Having almost non-existent cooking skills coupled with her lack of female charisma, Hotori is relegated into cleaning duties and running errands. Despite her limitations, she is very earnest in her work and genuinely wants to help not only the elderly proprietress but also the shopping district as a whole. ; : :Born on September 10. Toshiko is the pretty and well-endowed friend of Hotori. She decided to work in the same café when she discovered that her crush, their classmate Hiroyuki Sanada, is the lone regular customer. Her superb culinary talents and irresistible feminine charm instantly make her an indispensable asset for Maid Seaside Cafe; she has the desirable qualities of a maid that proprietress Uki Isohata has not found in Hotori. Toshiko's only failing is that her lack of humility more often than not manifests into arrogance. Even if her brutally frank personality often clashes against Hotori's immature antics, they are still very close friends. She disapproves of Hotori's childish habit of nicknaming her \\"Tattsun\\" (sometimes extended even further into \\"Tattsun-tsun\\"), but later relents when the moniker catches on and everyone else begins using it. ; : :Born on February 16. Hotori's childhood friend and classmate. As the only child of a widowed fish merchant, Hiroyuki helps out often at their shop; he is quite skilled in preparing and cooking seafood. Being raised alone by a rarely affectionate father who was also known as a local troublemaker, they act more like siblings in a love-hate relationship. With his teen-idol good looks and congeniality, Toshiko is very enamored of him. But Hiroyuki hardly notices her advances because of his longtime secret crush on his childhood friend. Whenever he is alone with Hotori, he often fantasizes scenarios wherein he is able to muster enough courage to finally confess his feelings for her. ; : :Born on April 6. Proprietress and head maid of the Maid Seaside Café, Uki took over the ownership of the restaurant after her husband died more than a decade earlier. To keep up with the current trend of the present generation, she converted her curry shop into a maid-themed cafe. Business started slow because the restaurant was severely understaffed with just her doing the cooking and Hotori waiting on the tables. Though they are unrelated, Hotori has known her for a long time and lovingly calls her \\"Granny\\". Although somewhat tyrannical at times, Uki genuinely cares for the well-being of others and is a well- respected elder in their community. Aside from her troublesome spine, she appears to be in good health and is still quite outgoing for someone her age. ; : :Born on August 7. Buck-toothed classmate of Hotori and table-tennis ace. ; : :Born on November 29. Oya High School mathematics teacher. He is also Hotori's homeroom teacher and sees her as one of his two nemeses (the other being his own math teacher from childhood). Hotori has a crush on him. ; : :Born on September 8. Initially mistaken as a younger boy by Hotori due to her short hair and slight build, she is in fact an upperclassman at Oya High School and the most laid-back member of its ping-pong club. Despite her seemingly uncaring personality and non-conformist nature, she is unexpectedly devoted to her parents and a good friend especially towards Hotori.

It is currently based in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria with regular appearances in local, national and international headlines, and whose actions and opinions have a regular effect on environmental policy with the Canary Islands.  History  Ben Magec has its roots in Haria, Lanzarote when in 1989 a group of ecologists from all over the archipelago met together in order to join forces and a create a base for communication and exchange. This first meeting was called the Assembly of the Canarian Ecologist Movement. These meetings became annual, taking place on a rotating policy of each of the Canary Islands and were dedicated to the idea of creating a base for communication and exchange of ideas, looking for solutions to common problems and concrete solutions, whilst still respecting the autonomy of each group within the collective. In the following years the collective took on several important issues, such as ´Save the Rincon´, a project to try to halt urbanisation and construction on farmland in the area of La Orotava.  Biggest campaigns  The importance of the organisation is said to be quite understated today, especially in consideration of the movement of ecologists and the potential changes to the countryside of the Canary Islands. It is said that there are many areas of the Canarian Archipelago that would have been developed and changed in a very different way to what they have been if it was not for the impact of Ben Magec. Two examples of this are the rural coasts of Veneguera (Gran Canaria) and El Rincon (Tenerife). These two areas were seen as being under threat during the decade of development during the 1980s. The growth of the ecologist and social sectors lead to the creation of a Popular Legislative Initiative, calling for a halt to the development of tourism on the islands. It received more than the necessary amount of signatures, and after going to parliament was respected and seen as the decision of the people. This theme continued into the 21st Century with the campaign relating to the growth of tourism, the campaign was called ´Canarias tiene un límite: Ni una cama más´ ( The canaries have a limit: Not one bed more). This campaign was particularly prominent on the island of Lanzarote.Dávila Ojeda, Heriberto, 40 años de movimiento ecologista en Canarias. Una historia necesaria por hacer, Página Abierta, 166-167, 2006 (Spanish) This citizen initiative demonstrated Ben Magec's ability to prevent the transformation of countryside and areas that would have otherwise been more developed by now than Puerto Rico or Puerto de La Cruz. Although these are two important examples, this defense of the territory has not relented and the last example of such work were the protests against the idea of building a new maritime front in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in which 60,000 people took part.AA.VV., Ciudad de tres mares, Ecologistas en Acción de Las Palmas de GC, 46-48, 2006, In spite of fluctuations, the organisation has grown, and since the year 2000, it has been more than a simple co-ordinator of isolated meetings and campaigns, but a more structured organisation with an important media presence. It has also been developing its own identity within the movement. In 2003, Ben Magec- Ecologistas en Accion won the Cesar Manrique Prize for its work in defense of the environment.

He is a longtime associate of A. R. Rahman. He has been described by guitar legend John McLaughlin as \\"one of the leading edges in drumming\\", and is now part of John McLaughlin and the 4th Dimension. Early life and background Born into a family steeped in Indian classical music and dance, melody and rhythm has always been an integral part of Ranjit's life. His mother was the renowned Kathak dancer, Sitara Devi. His response to the western drum kit, even at the age of 12, was almost organic and his natural flair, ease and craft catapulted him onto becoming one of India's leading artists on the instrument at the age of 17. In 1980 he performed at the Jazz Yatra in Europe with the Jazz Yatra Sextet (with Louis Banks), besides performing with Pandit Ravi Shankar's ensemble on the same tour. This phase saw journeys to Europe and the West with leading Indian jazz/pop and classical musicians. Between 1980 and 1982, Ranjit performed at European festivals which also featured jazz greats such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Al Foster, Billy Higgins, Cecil Taylor and Louie Bellson, among others. Career Ranjit draws from his ancestry from the North of Indian (Uttar Pradesh) and from the West of India (Gujarat). His father is Gujarati and his mother is from Varanasi. Ranjit has also had a long career in composition and music production, working out of his own state-of- the-art studio facility in Mumbai. It is in this connection that he had the honour of working with the sound and music production industry legend, the amazing Bruce Swedien, who mixed Ranjit's songs on Vande Mataram 2 and Senso Unico, an Indo-Italian feature film. Bruce has had a great influence on Ranjit's musical life and approach to a lot of his contemporary work. Combined with his strong roots in the Indian classical tradition, his world view of music gave him a unique perspective on the Indian Film genre. His journey in this prolific industry started in the 80s and he has been a featured drummer and arranger for Industry giants such as R.D. Burman, Laxmikant – Pyarelal, Kalyanji – Anandji, continuing through the eras of Anu Malik and Ismail Darbar, and to the present, as one of the most sought after arranger/ producers. His work in this field has also earned him much acclaim and recognition as a Music Composer and Arranger for Album Projects and Feature Films. Ranjit has been an integral part of some of A.R. Rahman's greatest work through the years and continues to bring his unique personality to this genre of music. He has had the distinct honour of performing often with Maestro Zakir Hussain, including a Masters of Percussion Tour of the US and Canada. Ranjit's versatility as a drummer/ musician has led to unique collaborations with varied artists such as Carnatic mandolin legend, U. Srinivas, Carnatic violin maestro L. Subramaniam, Hindustani slide guitar master exponent, Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, sarangi. At the Jazz Yatra '80, he performed with the Jazz Yatra Sextet, and also performed with the great Pandit Ravi Shankar's ensemble, Jazzmine, featuring John Handy, George Adams and Mike Richmond of the Mingus Dynasty. On the Jazz Sextet's first European tour, Ranjit met Don Cherry. There was an instant connection, primarily because of Don's free spirited approach to life, one in which everyone was welcome, as part of his 'family'. He immediately took a liking to Ranjit and invited him to jam at a jazz club in Warsaw. This connection eventually led to a performance at the 1982 Jazz Yatra in Bombay. His approach to drumming and the use of vocabulary has been influenced by great rhythm masters such as tabla legends Ustad Allarakha and Ustad Zakir Hussain, Billy Cobham, Tony Williams, Elvin Jones, Steve Gadd, Omar Hakim, Al Foster, Peter Erskin and the Carnatic giants such as Palghat Raghu and Karaikudi Mani (mridangam), Palnivel (tavill), Hari Shankar (Khanjira), and his friend and teacher, Sridhar Parthsarthy (mridangam, hand percussion). His collaborations with musicians abroad have included unique performances with renowned artists such as John McLaughlin, Jonas Helborg, Ayden Esen, and Tim Garland. He has been always inspired by the path-breaking work of guitar legend, John McLaughlin and was recently featured as the drummer in his Grammy nominated album 'Floating Point'. Ranjit has released his highly acclaimed debut album, titled 'Bada Boom', worldwide in November 2010, featuring some of the greatest musicians on the scene today, from India and the West. This album is a collection of Ranjit's Jazz Fusion and World compositions with performances by Ustad Zakir Hussain, John McLaughlin, U. Srinivas, U. Rajesh, Scott Kinsey, Matt Garrison, Wayne Krantz, Dominique Di Piazza, Harmeet Manseta, Taufique Qureshi, Sanjay Divecha, Tim Garland, Gwilym Symcock, Ayden Esen and Elie Afif, to name a few. Ranjit has recently been the Music Composer and Sound Designer for the entire Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games Delhi 2010, and is representing India with his Live Performance at the \\"India Inclusive' showcase at WEF, Davos 2011.

He played professionally for the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. He also played college football from 1889 until 1891 for the Penn State Nittany Lions. He was born in Pittsburgh in 1869. He died in Ohio in 1958. Professional career Aull served as the team's captain for the 1892 season. His brother Burt also played on the team. Charley was also accused of bringing in a ringer for the club against its rival the Allegheny Athletic Association That year Aull stated that he met an old friend named \\"Stayer,\\" on the street prior to the team's October 21 game against Allegheny. Since Pittsburgh was in need of replacement at center, \\"Stayer\\" agreed to replace the injured regular player. A week after the game, it was disclosed that \\"Stayer\\" actually was A.C. Read, the captain of the Penn State football team. Although no one could prove that Read actually had been paid, and Aull had not tried to present him as a Pittsburgh A.C. member, Allegheny hired under the table Pudge Heffelfinger, a college star formerly from Yale, for $500, to play for the club in a November 21 rematch. This game made Heffelfinger the first professional football player. During the rematch, Aull reportedly received an injury when he was crushed beneath a pile of several Allegheny players. As a result, Charley's back was so wrenched he had to be taken off the field on a stretcher. His brother Burt, was also injured during the game, after receiving a fierce blow to the head which forced him to retire from football. In 1893, Charley was renamed the team's captain. On October 7, 1893, he was reportedly injured in a 10-0 Pittsburgh A.C. win over Western University (today the University of Pittsburgh). He was out of the Pittsburgh line-up for two weeks with a swollen lip. In 1895, Aull served as Pittsburgh's quarterback. College football Prior to his professional career, Aull played at the college level for Penn State from 1889 to 1891. On November 11, 1889, Penn State suffered their worst loss in football history falling to Lehigh University 106-0. The players arrived back at campus and asked about the game. Aull stated that \\"We couldn't get at the son-of-a-bitch with the ball.\\" On October 28, 1900 Aull was the referee for a game between the professional Duquesne Country and Athletic Club and the amateur Penn State football team. Duquesne won the game, held in Pittsburgh, by a score of 29-0.

It is located on an island in the hydropower regulated Little Lule River between the villages of Björkholmen and Randijaur in the municipality of Jokkmokk in the province of Norrbotten in northern Sweden. It is located near to the hydropower plant Parki, and the regulation reservoirs Parkijaure and Randijaure. Furthermore the site is on the ancestral lands of the indigenous Sami people and forms part of the reindeer winter grazing lands of the Sami village of Jåhkågasska tjiellde Sirges. The name Kallak is the Swedish form of Gállok, which is the original name of the place in the Lule Saami language. The Kallak north and Kallak south prospects were identified by the Geological Survey of Sweden in the 1940s. In the late 1960s the SGU identified Kallak north as containing 92 million tonnes of ore and Kallak south as containing 29 million tonnes of ore at a grade of roughly 35%. Beowulf Mining acquired the Kallak north licence in 2006, and a drill program conducted in 2010 has found at least 175 Mt of Iron at an average grade of 30%. Beowulf acquired the Kallak south licence from Tasman Metals Limited in mid-2010. An ongoing drill program has shown Kallak south to contain at least 400 million tonnes of Iron at an average grade of 30%. The combined Kallak deposit contains at least 600 million tonnes of Iron and it is believed that the north and south deposits are connected at depth to give a single iron deposit with a strike length of over 4 kilometers. In mid-2010 an independent conceptual study performed by the Raw Materials Group showed that the Kallak north deposit, which at the time was thought to contain 150 million tonnes of iron at 30% grading, was commercially viable. Given the significant increase in tonnage at Kallak an updated conceptual study is anticipated in 2011. The plans to establish a mine at the site has met resistance from the indigenous Saami people as well as other local inhabitants and has also raised concerns in regard to dam safety, within the hydro power regulated Lule River. On July 1, 2013, protesters set up a road blockade in order to prevent test drilling. On July 30, the blockade was dismantled by the police, but on the next day the blockade was set up again. Dam safety research points at the problems of combining hydro power with tailing dams, within the same system. In Sweden this would be the first time such a combination is made, and thereby this would be a full scale experiment with major risks for people and drinking water provision downstream, amongst other the cities of Boden and Luleå.Designing dam safeties: perspectives on large scale dams within the intra-actions of technology, nature and human decision making In 2014, Norrbotten County said no to further mining in Kallak; the case would be closed if the Swedish governmental geology decision-making body Bergsstaten had agreed with Norrbotten County. However, Bergsstaten overruled the county and it is now up to the government of Sweden to give a final answer to the question.

Healey was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina to Anglo-Scots parents. After attending school in West Sussex and Kent, she taught English in Argentina after the death of her father in 1930. In 1935 she moved to England to stay with her sisters. Marrying Hal Foote, they moved to Mexico City in 1936 where she studied painting and drawing with Angelina Beloff, the first wife of Diego Rivera. Here, during the period of the Mexican art renaissance, she met José Clemente Orozco who admired her work and advised her: throw away your art books – just work. In 1938 they moved to Guatemala City; her marriage ended after 5 years and in 1940 she met archaeologist explorer Giles Healey whom she married in 1943, settling in Los Angeles before a further filming trip to Mexico. Encouraged by sculptor Henry Moore in New York in 1946, they moved westwards to Pacific Palisades and in 1947 she studied with both Rico Lebrun and William Brice in Los Angeles. After moving to West Sussex from Big Sur, California in 1970, she learnt that many of her paintings had been destroyed in a fire in Big Sur in 1971. During her time in Mexico and Big Sur, the Healeys' friendships with other artists are well documented; such as Lee Mullican,\\" Oral history interview with Luchita Hurtado, 1994 May 1–1995 Apr. 13\\", Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.
