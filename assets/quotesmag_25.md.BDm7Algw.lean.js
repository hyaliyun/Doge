It is one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development by restricting certain forms of development. The Loch Rannoch and Glen Lyon NSA covers 48,625 ha, most of which lies in the council area of Perth and Kinross, with a small portion lying in Stirling. National scenic areas are primarily designated due to the scenic qualities of an area, however NSAs may well have other special qualities, for example related to culture, history, archaeology, geology or wildlife. Areas with such qualities may be protected via other national and international designations that overlap with the NSA designation. Loch Rannoch and Glen Lyon includes a National nature reserve at Ben Lawers, and there are three Special Areas of Conservation and one Special Protection Area within the NSA. Creation of the national scenic area Following the Second World War, a committee, chaired by Sir Douglas Ramsay, was established to consider preservation of the landscape in Scotland. The report, published in 1945 proposed that five areas (Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, the Cairngorms, Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount, Wester Ross and Glen Strathfarrar-Glen Affric-Glen Cannich) should receive a level of protection. The government therefore designated these areas as \\"national park direction areas\\", giving powers for planning decisions taken by local authorities to be reviewed by central government. Following a further review of landscape protection in 1978, additional areas, including the hills and glens to the east of Rannoch Moor, were identified as worthy of protection due to their landscape qualities. Accordingly, in 1981 the direction areas were replaced by the national scenic area designation, which were based on the 1978 recommendations and thus included the area entitled Loch Rannoch and Glen Lyon. The defined area remains as originally mapped in 1978, but was redesignated under new legislation in 2010. Although the national scenic area designation provides a degree of additional protection via the planning process, there are no bodies equivalent to a national park authority, and whilst local authorities (in this case Perth and Kinross Council and Stirling Council) can produce a management strategy for each one, only the three national scenic areas within Dumfries and Galloway have current management strategies. Geography :Main articles: Ben Lawers, Loch Rannoch and Glen Lyon The designated area covers much of the historical province of Breadalbane, and covers landscapes ranging from flat, fertile farmland up to exposed mountain summits. Ben Lawers, at 1214 m, is the highest point in the highest and most extensive mountain massif in the southern part of the Scottish Highlands.D. Bennet & R. Anderson. The Munros: Scottish Mountaineering Club Hillwalkers Guide, pp. 30-32. Published 2016. Schiehallion, an isolated peak lying in the east of the NSA, is one of the most prominent mountains in Scotland. The area is drained by two tributaries of the River Tay: the River Tummel (which drains Loch Rannoch) and the River Lyon, which flows through Glen Lyon. Most human settlement and activity has been concentrated along these two rivers; many of the smaller side glens also contain visible signs of previous occupations, for example in the presence of old shielings. The area contains fragments of the ancient Caledonian pinewood, along with areas of native birchwood. Other conservation designations There are a number of other protected areas that overlap to some extent with the national scenic area. *Ben Lawers has been designated as a National nature reserve since 1964. It is protected due to the presence of many rare and endangered arctic‚Äìalpine plant species, and has been owned by the National Trust for Scotland since 1950.NTS Guide (2018). Ben Lawers is also a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), again due to the presence of arctic-alpine flora. *The rivers Lyon and Tummel are both tributaries of the River Tay, and as such form part of the River Tay SAC. The designation notes the river system's importance for salmon, otters, brook lampreys, river lampreys and sea lampreys. *The Black Wood of Rannoch, a fragment of Caledonian Forest which lies on the southern short of Loch Rannoch, is also designated as an SAC. *Loch Finnart, which lies to the south Loch Rannoch at a height of 280 m above sea level,Ordnance Survey Landranger 1:50000 Map.

It was previously located in Durham, North Carolina. In the UK some of their products were sold under the Prinzsound brand, in Canada under the Fleetwood brand, and in Australia under the GEC brand. Weltron's early product range is known for its Space Age design. Currently Weltron is owned by Winston International LTD. History The Weltron name was first used in 1960 by Womack Electronics, a company run by Charles A. Womack. Womack Electronics filed a trademark application for the brand, which was to produce Cathode ray tubes, in 1962. The trademark was expanded in 1964 to cover the production of Radios, antennas and other devices, in 1965 to cover instruments such as electric organs and electric guitars, and in 1966 to cover electrical cleaning chemicals. Weltron current logo James Pratt Winston joined Womack Electronics late in 1968. He left the company and started a new Weltron company, with a 51% share of ownership. Womack owned the remaining 49% share. Weltron's early product range consisted of guitars and other musical instruments, but Winston soon concluded that the company would be better served with its own bespoke product line. He came up with the idea of a spherically-shaped stereo FM radio/cassette deck that could run on mains and battery power, known as the Model 2001. Released around 1970‚Äì71, the \\"very unusual\\" 2001 was priced at $159.95 (). The 2001 model was successful, and through 1972 the company developed other models, sold under the \\"New Shape of Sound\\" line. These included the 2002, a spherical AM/FM stereo radio, and the 2003, a spherical speaker sold in pairs. The new products were sold by direct marketing, along with advertisements in various consumer magazines. The model 2005 was advertised in May 1973, listed at $300 (). Model 2007 was demonstrated at the 1975 Winter Consumer Electronics Show, with a price of $399 (). The Model 2010 was listed in 1977 as costing $185 (). In 1974 the company was bought by LCA Corp for $1,500,000 and settlement of some of the company's debts. then owned by Walter Kidde Inc. Winston served as president of Weltron for about four years. In 1980 he started a new company, Winston International. About five years later Winston International purchased the Weltron brand. The company now sells a range of electrical products, including security systems and computer peripherals.  TV Shows  In 1970, James Pratt Winston publicly released his Weltron 2001 stereos. Today these stereos are often featured in movies and TV shows such as Austin Powers International Man of Mystery and That '70s Show for its iconic space age style. With both AM/FM radio and an 8-track player, they were the first stereos to combine multiple audio units into one boombox. They hit the market with a boom through their retro, futuristic design and portability, but few would ever expect the country man that was behind the invention.  Key People- James Pratt Winston  James Pratt Winston, also known as \\"Big Pratt,\\" was born in 1933 he resided in a small township called Grassy Creek on the border of Virginia. There are no stop lights, no schools, and no grocery stores, but Pratt has a rich family history in the region as evident by the many road signs boasting the Winston name. He grew up in a farmhouse off of James Winston Road on a tobacco farm. Although he would go on to pursue a career in electronics, Pratt's childhood home didn't have electricity until he was 18 years old. Pratt studied Civil Engineering at North Carolina State for a year. The following summer after returning home he was drafted to go to the Korean War and spent two years in the army. When he finally returned home to again work in tobacco industry month later it everything he had in the tobacco industry burned completely down. So there I was with no tobacco and he had nothing for the whole year's work. In later years, Pratt found out that with the GI bill he could go back to school. He then went back to school and attended Danville Community College and took up electronic engineering where he obtained his degree.Cecil McDowell, Pratt's professor, introduced him to a man named Charlie Womack. Charlie had a little radio supply company in town and gave Pratt a job in sales at Womack Radio Electrical. Pratt married his high school sweetheart, Gwendolyn Blackwell, when he was 20 years old. After getting a job in sales at Womack Radio Electrical Supply, he and Gwendolyn moved to Danville, Virginia and started a family. As time went on, Pratt impressed Charlie Womack so much that he was promoted to Executive Vice President of the company. James Pratt Winston (2019) He worked at Womack for several years, worked for Charlie Womack but then decided he wanted to start his own business. They then opened Weltron with Pratt as 51% owner and the entire Womack company as 49% owner. The first product they sold would be guitars.After selling over 140,000 Weltron guitars, Pratt and Charlie Womack decided to get out of the guitar business and sell only electronics. At home Pratt started working on making his own radio., his first one being in a rabbit box. After making his rabbit box radio, Pratt showed it to a friend and together they made the first round Weltron stereo that had both an 8 track tape player and AM/FM radio. The stereo could run on electric current or batteries for portability. After the success of Pratt's first stereo, Weltron 2001, he began designing new models throughout the early 1970s in a product line dubbed as \\"The New Shape of Sound.\\" The Weltron 2005 and 2007 models are very indicative of his original inspiration from the spacecraft on \\"War of the Worlds.\\" These models were meant to provide a full home entertainment system. In 1980, two years after moving back to North Carolina, Pratt opened Winston International Ltd, an electronic supply distribution company in the nearby town of Oxford. Five years after opening, he purchased back the Weltron brand and continues to sell Weltron products to this day. Weltron is now owned and operated by Pratt's son Francis Winston.

It is distinguished by its single smooth narrow leaf which is usually withered by flowering time and its up to ten small, greenish flowers. It grows in harsh environments in disjunct populations between Kalbarri and Southern Cross and has the smallest flowers of its genus in Western Australia.  Description  Caleana lyonsii has a single leaf, long, wide and which is usually withered at flowering time. Up to ten greenish-yellow flowers, long and wide are borne on a thin, wiry stalk high. The dorsal sepal and petals are narrow and hang downwards with the dorsal sepal pressed against the column which has broad wings, forming a bucket-like shape. The lateral sepals are also narrow but bend outwards. The entire upper surface of the labellum is covered with glands or calli and those nearer the tip are darker. Flowering occurs from late September to November.  Taxonomy and naming  The midget duck orchid was first formally described in 2006 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown who gave it the name Paracaleana lyonsii. The description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. In 2014, based on molecular studies, Joseph Miller and Mark Clements transferred all the species previously in Paracaleana to Caleana so that the present species became Caleana lyonsii. The specific epithet (lyonsii) honours Mike Lyons, who discovered the species in 1994.  Distribution and habitat  Caleana lyonsii grows in harsh environments including a sand ridge near Paynes Find. It occurs in disjunct populations north of Kalbarri, near Koolyanobbing and near Southern Cross in the Coolgardie, Geraldton Sandplains and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Conservation Caleana lyonsii (as Paracaleana lyonsii) is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

This is a monotypic genus and the one described species is Xyloterinus politus. It is native to North America where it infests both hardwood and softwood trees, as well as stacks of logs. Description Adult beetles are between in length and are a dark brown or blackish colour. The prothorax is squarish and has spines and two to four teeth at the front. The elytra (wing- covers) are a rufous brown colour and covered with a felting of yellowish bristles. The entrance to the galleries in which the larvae develop is about in diameter. Distribution and habitat This beetle is native to eastern North America, where it is present in both Canada and the United States. It infests both hardwoods and softwoods, mostly recently fallen or cut timber. Host trees include Acer, Alnus, Betula, Carya, Castanea, Fagus, Fraxinus, Picea, Pinus, Quercus, Tsuga, and Ulmus. Ecology After mating, the adult female tunnels into the bark, creating a gallery up to long in the sapwood. Like other ambrosia beetles, the female carries a fungal culture with which to inoculate the walls of the galleries. On either side of the original tunnel she creates two further galleries about long. The eggs are laid singly, each in a cup-shaped cradle beside the side gallery, the entrance of the cradle being plugged by frass. The eggs hatch within about fourteen hours, and the larvae feed on the mycelia and spores of the fungus, enlarging the cradle as they grow. Wood fragments accumulate in the main tunnel and may escape from or be pushed out of the entrance by the female. The larvae take about 19 days to develop fully, before pupating. The new adults exit the cradle and then turn round and re-enter, feeding on the ambrosial growth. They overwinter in the empty cradles and galleries and exit the wood through the original entrance.

Background The Zutistes were a fringe spin-off from a splinter group of Parnassians, known as the \\"Nasty Fellows\\" or \\"Villains Bonshommes\\",G Robb, Rimbaud (London 2001) p. 129 who formed a Parisian dining club at the close of the 1860s. Without having a formal manifesto, and taking their name from the French exclamation of baffled exasperation, Zut,G Robb, Rimbaud (London 2001) p. 129n this informal gathering of artists known as the Zutistes gathered around the figure of the pianist Ernest Cabaner, who worked as a bartender/piano player at the hotel. Anarchic in spirit, they looked back regretfully to the atmosphere of the recently overthrown Paris Commune.G Robb, Rimbaud (London 2001) p. 129 A significant figure in the circle was Charles Cros, while other members were later better known, like Verlaine and Rimbaud. The most significant trace of the movement came with the re-discovery in the Thirties of the Zutique Album, with some 101 literary entries accompanied by (sometimes pornographic) drawings.J Austin, Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern (2013) p. 37 The Album Shot through with black humour, and riddled with parody and pastiche of contemporary styles and attitudes,J Austin, Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern (2013) p. 37 the album is the best guide to the Circle's membership of some fourteen names. A central target of the Album's mockery was the recently successful Parnassian Francois Coppee, while other more established figures like Jos√©-Maria de Heredia and Leconte de Lisle were also in the line of fire.J Austin, Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern (2013) p. 38 This album is in the form of an in-quarto Italian, black hardback cover, about thirty sheets handwritten, the other pages remained blank. Aftermath Nostalgia for the circle persisted among its members long after its break-up, perhaps as early as the winter of 1871‚Äì1872: thus for example the young Zutiste Raoul Ponchon was one of only seven recipients of Rimbaud's A Season in Hell;G Robb, Rimbaud (London 2001) p. 129 Charles Cros in 1883 used \\"zutique\\" to name a new poetry circle; while (perhaps coincidentally) as late as in 1897 the claim would be made that \\"man is by nature essentially 'zutique'\\".Anon, quoted in S Whidden, Authority in Crisis in French Literature (2016) p 64 See also  References   External links  *Album called Zutique category:Arthur Rimbaud Category:19th-century French poets Category:French male poets Category:Parodists Category:French satirists ","title":"Zutiste"},{"id":"57229569","text":"Nehalennia gracilis, the sphagnum sprite, is a species of narrow-winged damselfly in the family Coenagrionidae.

Although violent actions by Mozambican nationalists occurred earlier, it is from that moment that the fight spread throughout the North of the colony. The response of Portuguese forces to this situation was identical to their response in Guinea and Angola creating a mesh of grid forces, which could be tightened as needed, installing battalions and companies at key points, and carrying out actions control of populations, patrols to ensure the security of communication routes and offensive operations with the aim of destroying the bases of guerrilla groups. Operation Eagle was developed in a similar way to Operation Trident: an initial phase with the maximum number of personnel available for offensive actions and occupation of key points, with the establishment of operational bases, followed by surface actions, carried out permanently by units of and finally permanent occupation of the area by grid units. This would, moreover, be a mode of action often used by Portuguese forces whenever the enemy did not have the capacity to outdo these units. The operation The military in the Cabo Delgado area was centered on and around Mueda, the traditional capital of the Macondes plateau, which is the point of convergence of all major communication routes: * The road that connects the plateau to the sea, coming from Moc√≠mboa da Praia. * To the north, to Tanzania, through Moc√≠mboa do Rovuma. * To the south, towards Montepuez and Pemba (Porto Am√©lia). * To the interior of the plateau, for Nangolo and Muidumbe. Grouping 23 was formed to carry out the operation, which consisted of two battalions of hunters, the 558 and the A (Battalion of Hunters of Nampula) and by a battery of artillery of 8.8 mm guns. The guerrillas first sought to hinder the military‚Äôs actions, by conducting ambushes of patrols and actions of flogging columns On 1 July, Miteda base was attacked by the guerrillas. On 2 July, the Portuguese were ambushed. On 3 July, an attack against the Portuguese military base of Muatide occurred. These ambushes resulted in heavy casualties for the Portuguese forces, four were killed and eighteen were wounded. On 8 July the guerrillas triggered a Portuguese artillery and aviation bombardment on the Mitea- Nangololo-Muatide triangle, accompanied by ambushes on the likely lines of withdrawal of the guerrillas. On 12 July an Auster aircraft targeted guerrilla positions. On the 14th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 29th, and 30th of the same month, Portuguese columns were ambushed. On 31 July six soldiers were killed and twenty-seven soldiers were wounded. At the end of July, the operation was broken up into smaller units with the designations of White Eagle, Yellow Eagle (√Åguia d'Ouro and √Åguia Vermelha) thus continuing until 6 September, when the operation officially ended.

The crime was committed by Sarah Ann French who murdered her husband William French by administering a deadly dose of arsenic to his meal, an onion pie.  Sarah Ann French  Sarah Ann French was found guilty of wilfully murdering her husband, William French, on 19 March 1852. French was hanged for her crime in Lewes at the HM Prison Lewes in front of approximately 4,000 people, on 10 April 1852. Her execution became a huge event with some spectators even travelling by train to see it. French was the last woman to be publicly hanged in Lewes. Lewes decided to end public hangings because they were led to believe that French had been motivated to murder her husband with poison, as three years previously she had been a spectator at the hanging of Mary Ann Gearing, who also murdered her husband with the use of poison. They came to question that public sentences had no beneficial impact on society and that they should be carried out only in front of customary officers privately inside the prison, so as not to risk influencing others to commit the same crimes and ultimately meet the same end.  Murder  French murdered her husband by lacing his meal with 3d worth of arsenic in Horsebridge. The arsenic had been bought by her husband in order to kill mice in their house, and he gave it to Sarah to put away in a safe place where their child or anyone else could not find it. The meal in question, an onion pie, was served to William French on Christmas Eve in 1851. That morning, Sarah French told his co-worker William Funnell that this was a rarity in his household and in fact his favourite meal, and not even days later William French started to show symptoms of illness and rupture. Sarah's motive for murdering her husband was so that she could marry a man named James Hickman, as she on many occasions (even before her husband died) said that she had strong feelings for him. It was originally believed that Hickman had poisoned William French, however it became apparent after he testified against her that her feelings towards him were not reciprocated. Trial  On first inspection of William French's body and after an inquest held at the Gun Inn, the finding was that French had died from natural causes rather than from arsenic poisoning. However, further facts and evidence that came to light against Sarah French and her suspected involvement in her husband's death led to an inquest and then inevitably a trial so as to further investigate. William French's body was transferred to another coroner named Alfrid Swayn Taylor to see if he could find any sign of foul play. He found a number of small patches of yellow colour which were then found to be that of orpiment. From these findings and the testimonies from the witnesses, Sarah French was found guilty for the willful murder of her husband William French on 2 February 1852.http://www.sussex- opc.org/ParishDetails/EastSussex/Chiddingly/ChiddinglyMurder/ChiddinglyMurderC.htm  References  Category:Murder in East Sussex Category:January 1852 events Category:Mariticides Category:Murder in 1852 Category:1852 in England Category:1850s murders in the United Kingdom ","title":"Onion Pie Murder"},{"id":"57229859","text":"Palmodes dimidiatus is a species of thread-waisted wasp in the family Sphecidae.

In 2008 she was appointed professor at the University of Auckland. Academic career After completing a MA(Hons) at the University of Auckland, and a 1985 DPhil thesis on the social history of tuberculosis in Britain, at the University of Oxford, Bryder returned to Auckland, where she continued her research into the social history of medicine. Bryder's highest profile work has been in relation to the Cartwright Inquiry into the 'unfortunate experiment'. Her 2009 book A History of the 'Unfortunate Experiment' at National Women's Hospital did not support one of the inquiry's central findings (that there had been a prospective study) and attracted a great deal of attention in academia and in the popular press. https://www.womenshealthcouncil.org.nz/Features/Cartwright+Inquiry.html In 2010 she was invited to write an editorial in the New Zealand Journal of History on her research, and in 2018 she published a letter in the New Zealand Medical Journal drawing on new relevant international research. In 2019 and 2020 studies were published in Britain validating her original findings. Bryder has over 100 academic publications. These include a history of National Women's Hospital and a history of the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society. In 2009, Bryder was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand.

After the genocide of 1915 in then Ottoman Turkey and in search for safer place to live, some Assyrians fled to Europe, in southern France (Marseille and Toulouse).ABOONA Hirmiz, Assyrians, Kurds and Ottomans. Intercommunal Relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire, Cambria Press, 2008. The exodus from their land of origin, known historically as Assyria, has not stopped since then. It has even accelerated in recent years due to the general turmoil in the Middle East with all the risks it implies (kidnappings, ethnic cleansing and targeted killings).APRIM Frederick A., Assyrians: The Continuous Saga, Xlibris, 2005. The longstanding idea of setting up a pan-European umbrella for Assyrian organisations was materialised in 2016. The establishment of ACE was formally announced in the European parliament in Brussels on 22 April. The organization is the European counterpart of the United States-based Assyrian Policy Institute, with whom the ACE regularly cooperates.

Protected for its biological interest, the site is named after Pillar, which at is the eighth-highest mountain in the Lake District, and other fells in the same range. The area is 425.25 ha. History The site was notified in 1991. The site includes Side Wood on the south side of Ennerdale Water, which was formerly part of the adjacent Ennerdale SSSI. Ecology Side Wood is described as one of the best examples of an upland birch Betula pubescens ‚Äì sessile oak Quercus petraea woodland in West Cumbria. The trees of Ennerdale are important as an example of altitudinal succession. The vegetation changes from \\"native upland birch-oak woodland at 120 m\\" on the shores of the lake, through \\"sub-montane heaths and grasslands to montane heaths along the summit ridge at an altitude of 890 m\\". Above the woodland is gently sloping heathland dominated by heather, bell heather and bilberry; the associated grasses are sheep‚Äôs-fescue, common bent, mat-grass, tormentil and heath bedstraw. Higher up, bilberry and grasses predominate, while on the summit ridge, where the snow lies late, mosses, sedges, lichens and viviparous fescue occur. The crags of Pillar, away from grazing sheep, are home to a lush, herb-rich upland ledge community of plants. Breeding birds on Pillar and Ennerdale Fells include buzzard, peregrine falcon, merlin, raven, wheatear, whinchat, ring ouzel and red grouse. Ennerdale is managed as a rewilding project called \\"Wild Ennerdale\\", which was established in 2003. The Wild Ennerdale Partnership gives scope for the management of this site holistically at the landscape scale. Other measures of protection The SSSI is one of ten underpinning a Special Area of Conservation, Lake District High Fells, which was designated in 2005.

It is found in Europe, Asia, Central America, North America and Oceania. Description Adult warehouse beetles average about in length and are some shade of reddish-brown, dark brown or blackish-brown. The larvae are cream coloured or some darker shade of brown, and average in length when fully grown; they have long bristles at the tip of the abdomen. Distribution and habitat This beetle may have originated in Central Asia, but is now widely distributed, being found in Russia, China, parts of the Middle East, Europe, Central America, North America and Oceania. It is an economic pest in a range of dry goods including animal foods, wheat and barley kernels, wholemeal flour, corn meal, oat meal, noodles and other cereal-based foodstuffs. It also infests animal detritus, fish meal, spices, nuts, cocoa and sugar products. In the indoor environment it occurs in warehouses, granaries, food stores and dwellings, and outdoors in Russia, it has been found in bee nests. Life cycle Eggs are laid in suitable dry materials, and if kept in the temperature range , hatch in about a week. There are normally six instars, and some mature larvae enter an active diapause, especially in cooler habitats, and may remain in the larval state for two years. Non-diapausing larvae pupate near the surface of the foodstuff about seven weeks after the eggs were laid; the pupation period lasts about four days, and the new adults rest for two to seven days before emerging from the last larval skin. Longevity for males is nine days at and several weeks under cooler conditions. Females also live longer at lower temperatures.

She obtained an undergraduate degree in Political Science from Hindu College, Delhi, followed by a master's degree from Delhi University. Changkija married Bendangtoshi Longkumer. She has two daughters. Her husband died in 2017. Career Changkija began her career as a journalist with the Nagaland Times in 1985. She wrote a column The State of Affairs for this paper, and another titled Of Roses and Thorns for the weekly paper Ura Mail. Both the papers were based in Dimapur. During the long-running insurgency in Nagaland, Changkija began to write poetry and short stories to protest the violence, and to criticise the condition of society that led to the unrest. Changkija's writings put her in grave risk from the militants. Her editor at the Ura Mail was murdered in 1992. Changkija's poem Not be dead was written to honour his memory. Changkija founded the Nagaland Page in 1999. Focussing on issues affecting the state of Nagaland, she upset both the state government and the militants. An article published in her paper titled State is a reality and sovereignty is a myth led to demands from the terrorists that she disclose the author's name. When she refused, she was threatened with retribution. In 2004, bombing at Dimapur's Hong Kong market resulted in the deaths of hundreds. Changkija's impassioned Child of Cain was printed soon after.

Early life and career Petzmayer was born in Zistersdorf, Lower Austria in 1803; his father moved to Vienna, where in he ran an inn. He intended that hs son should continue the business. Johann started to teach himself to play a violin; aged 18 he had an opportunity to play a zither, and rapidly learned to play it.Johann Petzmayer Wiener Zitherfreunde. Retrieved 25 April 2018. His father's inn was near the Linienwall, an outer line of fortifications round the city, and so was visited by travellers. Guests came to the inn, attracted by the playing. The name of the inn was Zum Heiligen Johann (Holy John), and Johann became known as Heilige Schan. His reputation grew, and he was invited to play at the houses of nobles; in 1827 Emperor Franz I summoned him to play at court. Concert tours Playing the zither became his full-time occupation. In the following years he gave concerts in many towns and cities of Austria and Germany. In early concerts he was accompanied by a guitar and violin, later by a small orchestra. After playing in the opera house in Berlin in 1834, he was summoned to play for the King of Prussia at the court in Berlin: to Petzmayer's playing, the sisters Therese and Fanny Elssler performed l√§ndler of Upper Austria and national dances.

Facts A factory worker who was lowering an lid with an asbestos- cement lining onto a cauldron of hot acidic liquid accidentally knocked the lid into the liquid. Shortly afterwards a \\"violent eruption\\" occurred, causing serious burns to the claimant who was standing some distance away. Unknown to anyone, the asbestos-cement lining was saturated with moisture from atmospheric water-vapour, and the accident occurred when water in the lid turned to steam and \\"erupted\\". Held Applying the dictum in The Wagon Mound No. 1, the court denied the claimant a remedy, saying the injury was \\"too remote\\". Whilst it was foreseeable that a person standing nearby might be injured by \\"splashing\\", it was not foreseeable that an \\"eruption\\" might occur and injure a person outside the zone of splashing risk. The claimant argued that the concept of \\"class of harm\\" (as propounded in Hughes v Lord Advocate) should apply, namely, that although the eruption was not itself foreseeable, splashing was foreseeable, and that an \\"eruption\\" fell into the same class of harm as a \\"splashing\\". The court disagreed, saying that a splashing was a physical displacement, whereas an eruption was a chemical reaction which was NOT in the same class of harm. While the court may have been anxious not to revert to the strict liability approach of Re Polemis in 1921, the immediate consequence of this case is that an innocent claimant injured at work had no redress against his employer, even though: * any employer is normally vicariously liable for \\"the torts committed by his employees acting in the course and scope of their employment\\", * the employer had third-part liability insurance who could afford to pay, * the employer had a common law and statutory duty to provide a safe place of work.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. History Louise Lathrup Kelley Lathrup Village was conceived as a model community by developer Louise Lathrup Kelley, who platted the village in 1924. The first house was constructed that same year, and development continued into the 1960s. Development had to adhere to a number of restrictions, particularly that all buildings were to be single family homes, of low design, and faced with brick, stone, or stucco. The community existed with no government, save for the local township, until the 1950s. After 1945, more development came to the area, and primarily ranch houses were constructed. Description The Lathrup Village Historic District is a residential district, with streets laid out in a geometric and curvilinear street pattern that produces octagonal, circular and semi-circular focal groupings, and a series of small triangular parks scattered throughout the district. The district covers most of Lathrup Village, and includes 1156 buildings, of which 994 contribute to the historic character of the district. Nearly all of the district's houses were constructed between 1930 and 1940, and 1945 and 1960.

Royal Danish Army uniforms were originally influenced by French, Prussian and Russian military traditions. However, in more recent times, its uniforms have been characterized as being influenced by British uniforms, and, more significantly, American uniforms. History =Standardization= Painting showing the standard Danish uniform in 1864 The Danish Royal Army uniforms can be traced back to the creation of the army in 1614, where a couple of regiments were given similar outfits by the state. In the end of the 16th century, different army regiments began to introduce the distinct red coat. However, it was only after a Royal decree in 1711, it was expanded to all army regiments. Though all army regiments were required to have red coats, there were no standard uniform, with each regiment having different regimental Facing colours. The uniforms within the regiments were also different based on elements, such as rank, resulted in more than 400 different types of uniforms. When Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain became head of the army, he attempted to change the base colour to Prussian blue. However, Claude Louis was removed from power, in 1766, and a counter-order was issued changing it back to red. When Claude Louis returned to power, in March 1767, he instead issued orders to change the colour to white as the French Royal Army. Though, neither the blue nor white saw general use. Throughout the next 50+ years, the uniforms saw changes in cut of jacket and trousers, removal of the Tricorne in favour of the shako. Economic hardship also affected the uniforms, causing the removal of extravagant epaulets, feathers, tresses, and galloons. In 1842, the standardized uniform was presented throughout the Army. The standardized uniform retained the red coat and introduced light blue pants for all. The regimental colours were however removed and replaced with a standard blue, this meant that it was harder to differentiate between the different regiments. This led to all the regiments being given numbers, which would then be placed on the shoulder-straps. In 1848, the red coat was exchanged with a Double-breasted dark blue jacket, and the cumbersome shako was replaced with a more practical kepi. In 1880, the uniforms saw minor updates, along with a colour change of the hats, which had been made dark blue a few years prior. By the turn of the century, it was apparent the blue uniform was less than ideal as a field uniform and was in need of a replacement which was less prominent in the terrain. In February 1903, the more groundbreaking M/1903 uniform was presented to the General Staff. This uniform was in Reseda green and was inspired by the lessons learned by the great colonial powers, where the bright blue/red jackets where too visible in on the battlefield. However, after only 3 years it was withdrawn from service, as the General Staff did not want to replace the beautiful M/1880. The following uniform was the M/1910, which was blue like the previous ones, however, a more simplified version going from double- breasted to Single-breasted. The kepi was also hardened, to be more like the French version. With the increased risk of a German invasion during World War I, the Security Force was established to ensure Danish neutrality. This led to the 57,000 soldiers being deployed, creating extra demand on the production of the blue M/1910 uniforms. The shortage of blue dye and evidence that blue uniforms were less suitable in modern combat, led the General Staff to halt the production of the M/1910, and instead produce uniforms in different shades of grey, which then became the M/1915 uniform. Another lesson learned, was to remove the elaborate rank insignia, and move the insignia to the collar. However, due to supply shortages of the new uniform, both the M/1880 and M/1910 uniforms were still common to see during the war. =Modernization= Following the end of the WWI, the General Staff learned the M/15 had inadequate camouflage capabilities, leading to the creation of the M/23 uniform. This uniform was similar to the British uniform of the time, and added a Sam Browne belt for the officers. The same year, the M/23 helmet was introduced, meaning the kepi was replaced by a soft side cap with flaps, for enlisted, which was worn when the helmet was not worn. For officers, a soft peaked cap was introduced. For garrison usage, a hard side cap, with inspiration from the cavalry was introduced. Pips on the collars were also introduced to the officer corps. While meant for every service of the army, the large stock of blue and grey uniforms created during WWI, meant these had to be worn out before the M/23 could be issued. The uniform was however not completely introduced by World War II, with many soldiers being forced to use the M/15, with only officers having the new uniform. Following Operation Safari, Danish uniforms were appropriated by the German army. The Danish Army was relegated to the Danish Brigade in Sweden, where the received equipment from the British and Swedish. This meant that the Danes would wear the British Battledress as the combat uniform, which was called the M/44. To replace the aging M/23 officers uniform, the M/47 was introduced. This uniform was based around the design of the older M/23 and retained the same insignia, however, with a \\"turned-down\\" collar. The result of the \\"turned-down\\" collar also meant, that the four-pointed stars, which had previously signified personnel of the officer class, was replaced with the emblem of the regiment introduced at the same time. The peaked cap of the M/23 uniform was retained, with more ornaments and renamed M/52. In 1946, Denmark introduced a new steel helmet, which had the shell of the M1 helmet, but interior of the Mk III helmet. It was however cheaper to just buy the American helmet, which was named M/48 for Danish use. The equipment for the uniform had mixed elements of American, British and Danish origin. The M/44, was ineffective against the elements and received many complaints from the soldiers, this led the army to introduce the M/58 combat uniform. The M/58 combat uniform was very similar to the contemporary US counterpart. The new uniform was designed in such as way, that rank insignia had to be sown on, rather than shoulder straps. The M/58, was not deemed appropriate for walking-out, which meant that enlisted was forced to wear older the M/44. The following year, the garrison uniform (M/59) was introduced for enlisted soldiers. The introduction also meant that the beret was introduced to the army, and the side cap was mostly phased out. In 1961, the M/58 uniform colour was changed from khaki to olive green, furthermore the fabric was changed to a thinker version and shoulder straps were reintroduced. =M/84= The army had previously talked about adopting a camouflaged uniform compared to the single coloured M/58, however without reaching any agreements, as the single colour of the M/58 proved to be more effective in the Danish environment at distances of more than 300m. During a joint military exercise in Germany, it was reported that the M/58 uniforms were significantly more visible through Night vision than other nations. The Army Materiel Command and Danish Defence Research Service therefore began to research a new uniform in 1977, with special focus on making it less visible to the naked eye and night vision. The new uniform, first introduced in 1984, utilized M/84 camouflage pattern, which was a derivative of the Flecktarn B pattern specialized for the Danish environment. The uniform, also named M/84, became both the standard barrack dress and combat uniform for all branches. The new uniform, was created with the aim of creating a connected uniform system, rather than previous uniforms, which had elements from different periods. Originally, the shirt issued with the uniform served as both a combat and barracks shirt. However, this was changed in 1989, with the introduction of separate combat and barracks shirts. In 2000, an improved rain suit was introduced, replacing the older model, and in 2002 the national shoulder tab was removed and replaced with the national flag. ;Combat The combat uniform initially consisted of a combat jacket and trousers, rainwear in green on the outside and white on the inside, a waterproof Pelerine and a green Ushanka. The M/84 system saw gradual improvements over the years, starting in 1992, when Danish soldiers deployed on international missions were issued the Gefechtshelm M92. Later in 1996, older M/48 helmet was replaced throughout the army with SPECTRA helmet, and the aging M/59 webbing equipment, was replaced with a Danish version of the PLCE 95 Pattern, both designated M/96. In 2000, the fragmentationsvest M/00 was added, then Assault Vest (Kampvest M/06) was added, and during the time, the uniform jacket was improved with new pockets and moving the rank insignia to the chest. ;Barrack dress All branches of the Army issued the M/84, it consists of the barrack dress version of the pants and jacket, a green shirt, beret, and a stable belt in either black or the colours of the regiment. Furthermore, army regiments wear an Ascot tie, for official portraits and ceremonies. Due to the changing weather in Denmark, the shirt can either be short or long sleeved, and there can furthermore be worn a jumper or rain-jacket. There was also an equestrian version of the M/84, this was only given to HESK and officers of Guard Hussar Regiment as there were still horses in use. The equestrian uniform of M/84 was the same as the M/69 but featured a green shirt in lieu of the service dress uniform. =M/01= Following deployments to the Balkans, it was discovered that the M/84, made for the Danish environment, was too thick/heavy. Leading the army to create a light version of the M/84 (Let Kampuniform). With the deployments to the Middle East, a desert version of the light uniform was introduced, using the M/01 camouflage (√òrken Kampuniform). In 2010, a Combat shirt in M/01 were introduced, to allow soldiers to wear something lighter than the combat jacket. The M/01 uniforms were limited to deployed personnel, and were not given to the army in general. The relative rarity of these 'deployment uniforms', especially the desert version, meant that some of the equipment was not always in stock, forcing many soldiers to use woodland versions. Current Uniforms =Full Dress= Frederick VIII of Denmark wearing the General full dress uniform The full dress uniforms is the most elaborate and traditional uniform worn by the Royal Danish Army. All ceremonial dresses apart from the Guard Hussar Regiment's and Royal Life Guards', can be traced back to the standardization in 1848, where all services were given coats in the same cut. With these coats, the infantry, engineers and artillery wore dark blue coats while the cavalry wore light blue. The uniforms are however, less common today, as it was withdrawn from general issue in 1964, when it was no longer compulsory for officers to own a full dress uniform. However, personnel serving as aide-de-camp to the Monarch, Generals, the Judge Advocate General and the Commandant of Copenhagen are required to own a full dress uniform. The officer corps of the different services have retained their ceremonial dress uniforms. It is however only used for balls or audiences with the Queen. The uniform has a choker-style collar and is worn with a Kepi. The generals' full dress M/1880, is more elaborate than officers' with gold ornamentation and is worn with a bicorne with feathers. Hussar Different types of hussar uniforms The hussar uniform is only worn by the Mounted Squadron and officers of the hussar regiment on ceremonial occasions. The first hussars in Denmark, were Austrian mercenary who worn their own national uniforms. With the creation of Denmark's own hussar regiment in 1762, the first version of the uniform was introduced, and has remained practically unchanged since 1870. Due to this fact, the uniform contains a pelisse and a sabretache, which is not found in any other uniform in the world. The blue dolman was introduced with the creation of the regiment in 1762, and saw a number of small changes, before being replaced with a simplified version, having fewer braids across the chest in 1870. The red pelisse was introduced in 1762, and was originally meant to protect the hussar from sabre cuts. The pelisse is worn over the left shoulder and exists in two different colours, Cardinal red for officers and crimson red for NCOs and enlisted. The difference in colour can be traced back to 1870, when the new dolman was introduced and the pelisse was removed from the uniform. Edward, Prince of Wales, being a big fan of the Danish hussar uniform, suggested to allow officers to continue wearing the pelisse, as they had to buy them privately in either case. The older model from before 1870, was from this point given to the NCOs and privates to be used until they were worn out. The NCO pelisse are said to still being \\"worn out\\" till this day. Both versions of the pelisse are provided with lanyards (called mantequets) used for holding the pelisse in place. The current light blue breeches with a white stripe along the outseam were introduced in 1822. The original pants in 1762 were also light blue, but between 1774-1822 different colors were used, yellow were however most common. The uniforms still possess the sabretache which is in the colours of the regiment, with the royal monogram. It is the only uniform in the world to still use it, and has been in use since the reign of Frederick V. In the beginning the hussars would wear a Fl√ºgelm√ºtze, however, by 1774 it was replaced by a tall shako. Today's version of the shako is significantly shorter and is worn with a cordon and pompom made of tail hairs for NCOs and enlisted, officers have white buffalo hair. There are two colours of pompoms, red for the buglers in the drum and bugle corps, while the rest have white. Life Guard Different types The Royal Life Guards can trace its uniforms back to 1660, where they would wear Red coats. Today, the Life Guards has two full dress uniforms, an guard duty and royal version. These are mostly used by the Guard Company and are worn depending on the occasion. The uniform in general features a scarlet or blue tunic (royal and guard version respectively), blue trousers, a white cross belt, and a bearskin with the regiment's cap badge. The blue jacket was introduced originally in 1790, when uniforms from the disbanded Zealand Dragoon Regiment was given to the Life Guard, to serve as field uniform. However, they saw limited use, and was removed from service in 1793. In 1848, along with the general infantry, the dark blue double row tunic was introduced as a field uniform ‚Äì resulting in the current blue guard jacket. The original headgear for the Guards was the Tricorne, which was introduced along with the uniform in 1660. In 1790, it was changed to the Mitre. In 1805, the bearskin with feathers was introduced. Like the Household Division of the British Army, the Royal Life Guards serve as an active protection force. As such they are issued modern assault rifles, rather than historic rifles like the Swedish Life Guards and U.S. Old Guard. The current M/95 was introduced for guard duty in 2003, replacing the older M/75, which in turn had replaced the M/50 in 1995. Additionally, the Life Guards are also equipped with an infantry sabre, which originates from the First Schleswig War, where it was a Prize of war taken from the Germans and originally a French infantry sabre. The Guard Company has continued the tradition of different coloured sword knots depending on the company. The 1st Guard Company therefore have red sword knots, while the 2nd have white, 3rd have blue, 4th have yellow and the Music Band have Crimson red. =Mess dress= ;Snorefrakke The Snorefrakke (or Snorekappe for the cavalry) is an all black Dolman. It can be traced back to 1858, and was meant to serve as an alternative to the standard uniform jacket. In 1923, it was changed to serve as an alternative to the standard mess dress, a function that continues to this day. It is worn with blue full-dress pants and a kepi, it not allowed to wear medals on the uniform, only ribbons. ;Normal With the introduction of the M/69 uniform, officers could wear service uniform, however, they lacked a mess dress that was not full dress or Snorefrakke. The army therefore, introduced the Selskabsuniform M/70, which can be worn as either a full evening dress or Black tie. The female version (M/81), only exists as black tie, and has a long skirt instead of pants. =Service uniform= During the '60s Danish Army officers, who was posted internationally, started to complain about the M/47 and M/59 service uniforms. The uniforms were seen as old and outdated, causing embarrassment for Danish officers serving international postings. Replacements for the M/47, started with T/68 test uniform, which was produced in different shades of green, and had a cut similar to the British battledress. The final design was decided in 1968 and resemblances to the American Green Service Uniform. It meant that the peaked cap was removed from service, except for the General Corps, who retained the M/52 cap, however with a colour change to fit with the M/69 uniform. The M/69 is designed with 5 gold buttons (silver for HESK), two breast pockets and two lower pockets. It is worn with either a beret or a stiff forage cap for some officers. The pants worn with it are a darker shade of green with a black stripe down the outseam. The uniforms also features a black tie, black socks and shoes, and a white shirt. The tie was changed in 2000, from a woolen tie, to a standard tie. All M/69 feature insignia denoting the branch of service on their lapel. proficiency badges and tabs can be donned on the M/69 uniforms. When women were allowed to join the military in 1971, a female version was introduced. The M/71(K) has no outer pockets and can be worn with either a long skirt or with pants. ;Equestrian There is also an equestrian version of the M/69, this is only given to HESK and officers of Guard Hussar Regiment as the regiment still employees horses on a daily basis. The equestrian uniform is the jacket of the M/69, but with green riding breeches in lieu of the green trousers, with extra long belt loops as to fit the stable belt. Black gloves, black riding boots with silver spurs and a black helmet or beret are also worn. =Combat uniform= With the increase in international missions in arid environments, a decrease in national threats, and need for more modern equipment, it was decided that the M/01 and M/84 was insufficient. This along with the fact, that the current uniforms' camouflage pattern was too specialized for the modern Danish international engagements in changing environments. One of the contenders was the Arid Flecktarn, which would have had the same pattern as the M/84 uniforms, but in different colours. It was however, decided that MultiCam would be the replacement, naming the new uniform system M/11, with a light and heavy version. The decision was based on experience from Danish and foreign special forces. It was furthermore estimated it would be cheaper to acquire a widely used camouflage than to create its own special uniform, and thereby removing the need for the M/01 desert uniform. The M/11 began to replace the M/84 Tjeneste and Kamp, from the winter of 2013, and saw a gradual replacement, with a completion date in 2018. The combat uniform is however different as there is more focus on personal customization, with improved body-armor and the new M/12 helmets. The barracks dress for the M/11 is the same design as the M/84 counterpart, with desert colours instead of M/84. Future In 2015, soldiers expressed wishes for a newer and more modular uniform system. Additionally, there was a wish for increased military cooperation between the Nordic countries. For this reason the Nordic militaries began a shared search for a Nordic Combat Uniform (NCU). The countries have, in 2018, each provided a list of requirements to suppliers, wanting customization and ability to work in all climates. The NCU will be in MultiCam for the Danish military, while it will be possible for the other countries to have a camouflage pattern specific to their needs. In November 2019, uniforms from the four final pre-qualified suppliers were issued to 480 Nordic special forces, soldiers and conscripts for testing. The uniform system will be provided in three configurations; European, desert and jungle where the European configuration is split into two, both a common (intermediate) which goes down to and a so-called \\"cold add‚Äìon\\" which can go down to . The total procurement cost is expected to be million. It is expected that an agreement for the period 2021-2028, will be concluded by the end of 2020.

Some such issues are natural while others are the direct result of human development. Organisations including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have published lists of rivers at risk. The WWF's 2007 list featured the Danube, the Nile, and the Rio Grande amongst others, stating that these \\"once great rivers\\" are in danger and \\"can no longer be assured of reaching the sea unhindered\\". The US National Park Service reported in 2015 that part of the Rio Grande \\"often lies dry\\". Dangers may be the result of the natural change of conditions in the local environment but many are due to human development projects such as dams and irrigation. Humans have also caused significant water pollution which endangers life which relies upon the water source. Importance According to the World Resources Institute (WRI) river basins are \\"indispensable resources for billions of people, companies, farms, and ecosystems\\" but many suffer from \\"water stress\\". It states that numerous major rivers around the world have become depleted to the point that they can fail to reach their destinations. Water scarcity is a danger to all the life that depends on the source. Dangers to rivers Beavers from North America constitute an invasive species in Tierra del Fuego. Rivers face many dangers, both natural and manmade. Climate change can have a significant impact on rivers, both positive and negative. This could be seen itself as an indirect result of human developments. An area which has a reduction in rainfall or an increase in temperature can make a river fully or partially dry out. This often means that the water can no longer reach its mouth. The flora and fauna of an area can face change and can have a substantial impact on landscape and local ecology. Invasive species can move into an area or be introduced by humans. One particular example of the latter is the case of beavers being introduced into Tierra del Fuego in 1946. While only 20 animals were transplanted into the area they quickly reproduced with no natural predator to curb numbers. Their effect on the area, through the damaging gnawing of trees and the building of their dams, has been significant enough that humans continue an attempt to undo their mistake with a program of beaver eradication. The ponds created by the beavers, which now number in the tens of thousands, have greatly contributed to the amount of organic matter retained by the rivers which then causes more problems downstream. =Specific human factors= Human interference in the form of river engineering can redirect the flow of the water using dams or channelisation. The increasing demand from irrigated agriculture, continued industrialisation, and residential use heavily impacts upon the health of river systems. This means that many areas face high levels of \\"baseline water stress\\". Rivers can be cut off from their floodplains and their normal route can be changed or disrupted significantly. If improperly managed this can have a devastating effect on the surrounding area and endanger the plants and animals that depend on them, including humans. Water pollution is another artificial danger which can be a serious threat to wildlife and human health. The Colorado River runs from the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado through four other states, parts of Mexico, and then on to the Gulf of California. Due to the human demands for water very little reaches Mexico and what does is often polluted. The Teesta River faces similar issues. The river flows through India and into Bangladesh, but India's water demands led to the part of the river in Bangladesh to dry up in 2018. If the situation continues it could be catastrophic for the local ecosystem. The Rio Grande Project was an irrigation, hydroelectricity, flood control, and interbasin water transfer project serving the upper Rio Grande basin in the southwestern United States. It was completed in 1952 and has had a significant impact on the surrounding area. In the past, the river was wide, deep and fast-flowing in its section through Texas, where it forms a large part of the Mexico ‚Äì United States border. Illegal immigrants once had to swim across the river at the border, but with the river so low immigrants need only wade across for most of the year. After leaving El Paso the Rio Grande often runs dry because so much water has been diverted away for human use. Other than extensive diversions, exotic introduced, fast-growing and water-consuming plants, such as water hyacinth and hydrilla, are also leading to reduced flows. The United States government has recently attempted to slow or stop the progress of these weeds by introducing insects and fish that feed on the invasive plants. Reports Pollution on the Citarum River In 2014 a Channel 4 report suggested that the Indonesian Citarum River, forty miles east of Jakarta, may be the most polluted river in the world. Running from Mount Wayang to the Java Sea, there are over 30 million residents who rely on the river. Rapid industrialisation has had such a harmful effect that the river's surface cannot be seen for the waste and detritus floating on top of it. =World Wildlife Fund report= The WWF published on their website the \\"10 Rivers most at Risk\\", a report from March 2007. They based their criteria on major rivers which already suffer or are particularly likely in the future to suffer from six key threats: dams and infrastructure, excessive water extraction, climate change, invasive species, over-fishing, and pollution. They noted that some of the greatest rivers \\"can no longer be assured of reaching the sea unhindered\\". The ten rivers which most concerned them are: =American Rivers reports= Each year American Rivers publishes a list containing ten of \\"America's Most Endangered Rivers\\". In 2018 its criteria focused on \\"threats [to rivers] from the Trump administration\\" and they selected the Big Sunflower River as the one most endangered using their criteria. The river is one of the main tributaries of the Yazoo River in the U.S. state of Mississippi but is threatened by the Yazoo Backwater Area Pumping Plant project which they say has the potential to damage 200,000 acres of important wetland. =World Resources Institute project= The World Resources Institute's Aqueduct project evaluated, mapped, and rated the state of the water supplies for 100 river basins in areas of high population. Their list highlighted the dangers to the Qom River, Yongding River, Brantas River, and Heray Rud River amongst others.

They are symbols of fulfillment of aspirations of village folk. In order to cater to the commercial requirements of the modern global market, the village potter is often combining the traditional rural abstractions with refined urban tastes to show pieces of terracotta art.

It is believed Parekh is influenced by Charles Taylor's essay on multiculturalism. Much like Taylor, Parekh focuses avoiding ignoring several aspects of multicultural values including but not limited to education, separation and gender values. Parekh criticizes theorists who over invest in a eurocentric view, and success relies on an equal distribution of political and economic power rather than a minority and majority. Parekh explores liberalism as a paradox unique to western political philosophy. The existence of only one way to live a good live leads to segregation of individuals in a multicultural society. Individuals who carry their own culture disturb relationships of power that in return culture has previously been established In. In later chapters Parekh also addresses separation of church and state will never entirely justify the separation of religion and politics, as religion represents so many citizens of most countries and in the world as a whole.  Reception  Rethinking Multiculturalism: Cultural Diversity and Political Theory has been reviewed by several political and cultural authors. While some criticism was addressed, the overall reception of Parekh's work's is positive as he attempted to remain unbiased and neutral when writing about multiculturalism. Dortha Kolodziejczyk overall acclaims it to be insightful for addressing typically unthought of issues, accrediting it to Parekh's way of thoroughly addressing both sides of the issues.  Criticism  Parekh's text was criticized from other cultural authors based on his opinions in the book. Many accused the text of having no real world use, and only theory to back it up. The text has few supported conclusions supported by real life scenarios. Other disagreement stems from Parekh's inability to address concepts of democracy, liberalism, citizenship and nation being from anywhere other than western politics. One cultural author Dortha Kolodziejczyk commented on Parekh's obsession of maintaining a non western approach to liberalism and culture while cementing liberalism as western. Kolodziejcyk says that many of Parekh's ideas do attempt to bring new ideas and perspectives, but not all of them in practice will work the way he intends.

This Chinese novel consists of two books, and the first volume was initially published in 2012 by the Hunan Literature and Art Publishing House, followed by the second volume in 2013. The books describe the love story between the nine-tailed fox queen of Qing Qiu, Bai Feng Jiu, and the first ruler of Heaven, Dong Hua Di Jun, spanning across three different lives in three different worlds. According to Tang Qi Gong Zi, she wrote the series after wondering why people are so fascinated with immortality, and questioning what the world would be like if everyone can live such a long life. The original books have been translated by fans and professionals into many different languages such as Thai, English, and Vietnamese.  Plot  Book One: Upper Volume \\"If perseverance will still be in vain, who would use up this entire life only to wait for an unobtainable love?\\" Part One: The Reborn Bodhi Vines The story begins with the wedding between Qing Qiu's Queen, Bai Qian, and the Heavenly Clan's Crown Prince, Ye Hua. Dong Hua and Mo Yuan, Ye Hua's twin brother and Bai Qian's teacher, came along with the wedding parade to receive the bride back to the groom's home for marriage, and here is where Dong Hua and Feng Jiu officially meet for the first time. After that, the story moves to heaven, where a banquet is held for the married couple, and after seeing Feng Jiu blame Mi Gu for the crime of kicking a flower pot toward his head, Dong Hua begins to take interest in her. Later, Bai Qian set Feng Jiu up on a blind date with a celestial fairy of Heaven. Not willing to remarry, Feng Jiu drove her date away, and mistook Dong Hua for Mi Gu. She then began reminiscing to him about Ye Qing Ti, her deceased mortal husband. On the last day of Lian Song's Flower Festival, Feng Jiu took her cousin, Ah Li, to see a play. On the way, Ah Li became tired and the two took a rest. Soon after, Princess Zhi He, Dong Hua's adopted sister's, carriage ascended from the lower realm and some celestials began gossiping about why she was banished to the mortal realm. Arriving at Cheng Tian Terrace, Feng Jiu fought with a Chi Yan (Red Flame) Beast and Dong Hua ended up saving her. Rumors circulated throughout the Heavens about Dong Hua, Zhi He, and Feng Jiu. Lian Song came to Dong Hua to confirm these rumors and said that if Dong Hua wanted to take a wife, Zhi He is not a bad choice. Escaping from a party she was forced to attend, Feng Jiu decided to take a late-night bath. Not long after, Dong Hua appeared and draped his cloak over her just as Lian Song came. Another rumor started out, this time saying that Dong Hua kept a beauty in his palace. Realizing that she lost the bracelet Qing Ti had given her, Feng Jiu went to find Dong Hua to inquire about it. However, she went at the wrong time, causing Dong Hua to tease her in front of the newly ascended immortals. Thus, another rumor started, mistaking Feng Jiu for Zhi He. Tian Jun, the emperor of Heaven, decided to hold a party for the newly ascended fairies and, wanting to please Dong Hua, he announced that Zhi He will be returning to Heaven. Zhi He silently provoked Feng Jiu into remembering the time she was bullied while acting as a maid at Dong Hua's Palace. To forget her painful memories, Feng Jiu got drunk and Dong Hua brought her back to her room, causing another rumor to circulate. No longer able to face the crowd, Feng Jiu instructed Ah Li to be her eyes and ears. While waiting for Ah Li to report back, Feng Jiu turned into a handkerchief to avoid another scandal with Dong Hua. Knowing full well that it was her, Dong Hua took Feng Jiu to his battle with Yan Chi Wu, a demon lord whom Dong Hua thought kidnapped his favorite pet fox long ago. During the battle, Chi Wu summoned a cyclone that swept both him and Feng Jiu away. The two ended up at a valley and, thinking that Feng Jiu is Dong Hua's lover, Chi Wu started telling her about Dong Hua and Ji Heng, Dong Hua's former fianc√©e's, love story. Part Two: Fan Yin Valley Later, the two ended up meeting the second prince of the Bi Yi Niao (Adjoin- Winged Birds), Xiang Li Meng, and was mistaken for the prince and princess of the Owl Clan. They stayed in Fan Yin Valley for half a year before Dong Hua came. Upon meeting, Feng Jiu made him turn into a handkerchief to quench her anger, but later found out from Chi Wu that Dong Hua tricked her again, and that he didn't come to save her, but was here to coax Ji Heng back. Hearing about the Saha fruit that could revive mortals, Feng Jiu decided to enter the tournament to win it, only to find that her name was not on the list of participants. Thus, she got Chi Wu to help her steal the fruit only to run into Dong Hua having a battle with a demoness. Feng Jiu got involved and ended up stuck inside a barrier with Dong Hua. The next day, Chi Wu told her that he was changing residence with Dong Hua. Knowing that Feng Jiu wanted the Saha fruit, Dong Hua got her name into the list of competitors and in thanks, Feng Jiu rented out a restaurant to treat him. However, the next day, Feng Jiu found herself confined and Dong Hua told her that he did this so that he could train her for the tournament. Later, Chi Wu came and took Feng Jiu out to comfort Xiang Li Meng, who was sad over the death of his pet cricket. His cousin, Jie Lu, explained that the cricket was a gift that Feng Jiu had given Xiang Li Meng when he was little. When she returned, Feng Jiu found the barrier stronger and that Dong Hua seemed distracted. Finally, the day of the tournament arrived, and Feng Jiu won first place, but was told that Dong Hua had given the Saha fruit to Ji Heng. Ji Heng said that she asked for the fruit to test Dong Hua's love for her and asked Feng Jiu not to come in between them. Thus, Feng Jiu was forced into stealing the fruit. She successfully obtained the fruit, but was surrounded by four pythons before she fainted from pain. Doug Hua went back to Heaven with a red fox that he had saved to get treatment. Back in Heaven, Zhong Lin noticed that Dong Hua was not his usual self ever since he returned from Fan Lin Valley. Example, in deep thoughts when he held a book up (not reading it), not waiting for the water to boil on his tea and asking Zhong Lin funny question like how to get rid of a person without other people knowing it. Lian Song came to see Dong Hua and told him that Feng Jiu is the beloved pet fox that Dong Hua has searched the world for. Later, Chi Wu angrily came and scolded Dong Hua for causing Feng Jiu's life to be in danger. Hearing this, Dong Hua quickly left and was relieved when he found that Feng Jiu was still alive inside the python formation. The Bi Yi Niao's Queen told Dong Hua that Feng Jiu is stuck inside of Aranya's Dream, and Dong Hua entered the formation to rescue her. Book Two: Lower Volume \\"In the middle of a foggy dream, one walks through whose shadow, destroys whose yearnings, and buries whose current life and past life?\\" Part Three: Aranya The Second book began with revealing that the reason why Dong Hua appeared distracted the last few days was, because he was trying to find ways to get rid of Chi Wu without drawing blood, and later realized that he was in love with Feng Jiu. Outside Aranya's Dream, Chi Wu took Ji Heng back and she cried, saying that she regretted her earlier decisions and revealed that the only reason Dong Hua agreed to marry her was because her father, Meng Hao, a water dragon who served under Dong Hua, had begged him to help her before he died. Back inside the formation, Feng Jiu woke and kissed Dong Hua, thinking that she was dreaming. Once she realized that it wasn't a dream, Dong Hua told her that they were married, and that she had amnesia, as she only remembered the events that happened 70 years ago. Due to injuries, Feng Jiu fell asleep again, and Dong Hua placed her body inside an ice coffin while taking her soul into the Dream World to recuperate. Feng Jiu woke and found that she is in the body of Aranya, the second princess of the Bi Yi Niao. She ran into Chen Ye, the Archmage, while trying to escape Prince Qing, a snake that Aranya raised. She later found out from her maid, Cha Cha, that Aranya doesn't have a good relationship with Chen Ye. Cha Cha also told Feng Jiu that Su Mo Ye, Aranya's teacher, had returned. The two met and Feng Jiu found out that Mo Ye entered Aranya's Dream to find the truth behind Aranya's death, and Feng Jiu agreed to help him. For Qing Hua's, Aranya's mother's, birthday, Xiang Li Que, the emperor, decided to go on a cruise to view camellias. On the ship, Feng Jiu met Aranya's sisters and her husband, Xi Ze, the former Archmage. Since it was his first time meeting Xi Ze, Mo Ye found a picture of him and realized that the Xi Ze he met is actually Dong Hua, but doesn't tell Feng Jiu, who did not recognize Dong Hua due to magic interference. Seeing him sad and lovelorn over Aranya, Feng Jiu thought to take him to see the Yue Ling flowers to cheer him up, but ending up going with Dong Hua instead. The next day, Feng Jiu was punished for leaving Chang Di, Aranya's younger sister, with Prince Qing. Chang Di replaced her cell with the Jiu Qu cage, and Feng Jiu was tortured for days. Then, a celestial fire broke out and Chen Ye saved her life. When Feng Jiu returned to her courtyard, she found Xi Ze carefully tending to the pregnant Ju Nuo, Aranya's older half-sister, and felt sorry for Aranya. Feng Jiu met up with Mo Ye and told him what happened to her. Feng Jiu ended up crying herself to sleep and Dong Hua, who had been listening behind a tree, took her back to her room and told Mo Ye not to tell Feng Jiu. Later at a banquet, Feng Jiu found out that Chang Di wanted to marry Xi Ze, but Dong Hua started to care more about Feng Jiu, causing her to wonder if he's been hexed. Jealous, Chang Di and Ju Nuo plotted to have everyone think that Feng Jiu was committing adultery with Mo Ye, but Dong Hua intervened. Part Four: The Shadowed Soul Both princesses were punished and when they returned to the capital, it was found that Ju Nuo's child is the result of an affair, so she was sentenced to death while Chang Di angered their father and was banished. Mo Ye requested Feng Jiu to repeat Aranya's life by saving Ju Nuo. In the original timeline, Chen Ye came out of seclusion and pleaded for Ju Nuo, his fianc√©e, and Aranya appeased her father's fury. In the end, Ju Nuo was banished and Chen Ye was under house arrest at Aranya's manor. One night, while watching the stars, Feng Jiu ended up going to the Shui Yue Swamp, the barrier between the Dream World and the Real World. There, she found Dong Hua fighting with a water serpent and learned from the spirits watching that they had been fighting nonstop for two days, because the serpent wanted to devour the girl sleeping at the bottom of the lake. In the end, Feng Jiu returned to her original body and Dong Hua was injured. When they met, Dong Hua kissed her and said that the serpent's poison caused him to do so. Wondering how Feng Jiu ended up in Aranya's body instead of in Ju Nuo's womb, Dong Hua decided to create a Miao Hua Mirror to let him see the lives of immortals. Feng Jiu made some toffee candies and had Cha Cha send them to Dong Hua while also sending Aranya's first letter to Chen Ye. This caused Chen Ye to throw a tantrum, saying that Feng Jiu can't be Aranya. Later that night, Dong Hua came to take Feng Jiu out to the Maiden's Festival. As Feng Jiu was scared that Dong Hua would turn homosexual, they ended up running away from a mob of girls who wanted to go on a date with Dong Hua. After a few days, Dong Hua switched places with Mo Ye, who had gone to help with the Miao Hua Mirror. Mo Ye told Feng Jiu about Wen Tian's regular visits to accompany Chen Ye to keep him from suspecting Aranya. Feng Jiu admired Aranya for being able to push the man she loved on to another woman. Mo Ye told her of the time the three went to visit Xi Ze and how Chen Ye saved Aranya. Two years later Xiang Li Que died, the new king died in battle, and Aranya hung herself while Ju Nuo became queen and forbid anyone from speaking Aranya's name. Afterwards, Feng Jiu asked Mo Ye about serpent poisons that caused someone to kiss another, and Mo Ye said that there was no such thing. To avoid Dong Hua's anger, he made Feng Jiu realize that she was in love. Before Ju Nuo left, Feng Jiu let her meet with Chen Ye just as Aranya had done. Later, she invited Chen Ye to tea to cheer him up, and he asked Feng Jiu why she was being nice to him when she was in love with Xi Ze. Feng Jiu said that they were only playing just as Cha Cha brought Dong Hua over. It began to rain heavily later that night, and Dong Hua appeared in Feng Jiu's room, drenched. Feng Jiu got him to take a bath and he asked her when she started to fall for Chen Ye, admitting that he wanted to kill him, but didn't want to see her unhappy. Seeing him jealous, Feng Jiu was overjoyed and said that she liked him, not Chen Ye, resulting in them consummating their marriage. A week passed and Feng Jiu let Dong Hua return to Qi Nan Palace to finish the Miao Hua Mirror. Chen Ye asked to meet with Feng Jiu and admitted that he created this world to revive Aranya. Then, he placed Aranya's soul into Feng Jiu's body. Feng Jiu fainted and saw Aranya's memories. After Xiang Li Que died, Chen Ye returned to Qi Nan Palace and Aranya was arrested for killing her father. Qing Hua visited Aranya and told her that Chen Ye had requested she be executed at the shrine as well as to allow him to marry Wen Tian. Aranya asked her mother if she'd ever loved her and what she had done to cause Qing Hua to want her to die. Qing Hua said she'll repay her in their next life, but Aranya refused and sadly lamented on how much Chen Ye hated her to hand her this revenge. Later, Aranya was kidnapped by Xi Ze and asked him to take her half-brother, Xiang Li He, to a safe place so that he wouldn't be killed by Qing Hua. Aranya took Xiang Li He's place on the battlefield and, at the cost of incinerating her soul, performed the Soul Evocation Formation to defend her home. On Dong Hua and Mo Ye's side, once the Miao Hua mirror was completed, they saw Chen Ye's past. Chen Ye met Aranya when she was still in the snake pit, where she was thrown in by her mother after she was born. He told Aranya her name and fed her. Wishing to take Aranya out, Chen Ye left for training to become the next Archmage powerful enough to provide Aranya with a happy life. When he returned, Mo Ye was the one who took Aranya out of the snake pit. Later, Chen Ye attended a banquet in Heaven and Aranya got married, causing Chen Ye to distance himself further from her. After he became Archmage, Qing Hua forced an engagement between him and Ju Nuo, and Chen Ye avoided marriage by going into seclusion. He came out on Ju Nuo's execution day and realized that he no longer recognized the person Aranya had become. When he stayed at her manor, Chen Ye knew that Aranya was writing to him under someone else's name and was furious. However, he realized that he was in love with her when they went to visit Xi Ze. Later, Qing Hua came and asked him to help her crown Ju Nuo and Chen Ye agreed in exchange for Aranya's life. To avoid Qing Hua's suspicion, he requested a marriage with Wen Tian. Then, Chen Ye secretly went to see Xi Ze and asked him to take Aranya away to a safe place. Chen Ye passed his days in leisure until Xi Ze came to visit and told him of Aranya's death. Chen Ye was in denial and ran to the place Aranya died. He was prepared to die with her when Xi Ze appeared and said that there might be a way to resurrect Aranya. In anger and regret, Chen Ye caused Fan Yin Valley to fall into eternal winter to mourn Aranya's death. After that, he created Aranya's Dream. The image in the Mirror than shifted to Heaven, 300 years ago, revealing the picture of comatose Dong Hua after suppressing the dark energy of the Miao Yi Hui Ming Realm (Hui Ming Realm). It is then revealed that Chen Ye was created from a part of Dong Hua's shadow to guard the Hui Ming Realm. Before he could look into Aranya's past, Dong Hua appeared in front of Chen Ye and took Feng Jiu back. Upon seeing Dong Hua's renowned sword, Chen Yi recognized the former Master of the Universe and asked him to return Feng Jiu to him, but Dong Hua refused. The Miao Hua mirror then revealed a picture of Feng Jiu meeting with the Lord of the Underworld, Xie Gu Chou, who told her of Chen Ye's existence. Feng Jiu asked him to create a soul out of half of her shadow, and send her to serve Chen Ye. Finally knowing the truth, Chen Ye lost the will to live and the Aranya's Dream started to collapse. Dong Hua sealed Chen Ye and Aranya's soul into two trees to allow them to be together. Next, he summoned the Elderly Fairy guarding the Stone of Destiny to inquire about his fate with Feng Jiu. The Elderly Fairy said that originally, the two did not have a fate, but because of Chen Ye and Aranya's failed fate, they were allowed to meet to continue this fate. However, he warned Dong Hua that because he had inquired today, tomorrow, destiny could change. Part Five: Mistaking Destiny They left Aranya's Dream and Dong Hua altered Feng Jiu's memories to preserve the fate they had together. Later, Chi Wu and Feng Jiu met up to say farewell to Xiang Li Meng, as the Bi Yi Niao now knows that they are not from the Owl Clan. Feng Jiu also revealed that the person Xiang Li Meng was in love with is actually her. Xiang Li Meng's image of Feng Jiu was destroyed and he ran out, saying that he'll never trust women again. Ji Heng confronted Dong Hua the day they were returning to Heaven, begging him to take her along. However, Dong Hua refused, saying that by staying in the Valley, the poison in Ji Heng's body will stabilize itself and disappear after 3000 years. Once returned, Feng Jiu went to see Bai Qian, and was reminded of her Bing Cang (concealment of weapon) ceremony, a ceremony proving her capabilities to protect her people. Feng Jiu panicked, and dedicated her time to finishing her sword. Finally, the day of the Bing Cang Ceremony arrived and Feng Jiu displayed her sword's capability by passing through various trials. She was about to place the sword with the others when Nie Chu Yin, one of the Seven Lord of the Demon Clan, appeared and challenged her to a duel. As expected, Feng Jiu lost, but before Chu Yin could secure a favor from Qing Qiu, Han Shan Zhen Ren, a celestial under goddess Nuwa, said that Chu Yin still has to win against Feng Jiu's husband. When Dong Hua appeared on the platform, Chu Yin wanted to back out. In the end, Chu Yin lost and the ceremony was completed. After that, Dong Hua talked with Bai Zhi, Feng Jiu's grandfather, and their marriage ceremony was set. Later, Chi Wu appeared and asked Dong Hua to come with him to save Ji Heng, who had left Fan Yin Valley. Dong Hua never returned for the wedding, and Feng Jiu later heard from Bai Zhi that he had eloped with Ji Heng. Feng Jiu waited for Dong Hua to come and explain himself to her, but he never did, and her health began to decline. Zhe Yan, the first phoenix of the universe, came to visit and told Feng Jiu that her memories were altered and that she is pregnant. Afterward composing herself, Feng Jiu went to the Underworld to revive Qing Ti, leaving him in Gu Chou's care while she went to the Human World. 200 years passed and from all of Bai Qian's previous letters, Feng Jiu learned that Dong Hua had come to look for her, but Bai Zhi turned him away. Dong Hua refused divorce and searched the world for her. In her latest letter, Bai Qian said that Dong Hua now knows that Feng Jiu is in the mortal realm. After that, Feng Jiu received a letter informing her that Dong Hua will grant mortal ascension into divinity one last time before it's closed forever, causing Feng Jiu to return to Heaven to help with Qing Ti's ascension. When she first descended to the Human Realm to repay her life-saving debt to Dong Hua, Feng Jiu was known as Consort Chen, a small concubine in the harem. Emperor Song, Dong Hua's mortal incarnation, bestowed her away to become Qing Ti's concubine. Feng Jiu did not hid her true identity and told Qing Ti many things. Qing Ti ended up dying to protect her from a demon's blade and Feng Jiu promised him that she will mourn for him for three lifetimes, but could not give him the love he asked for. After meeting with Qing Ti, Feng Jiu met with Dong Hua. He briefly explained himself and said that Feng Jiu is the most important person to him before giving her a crystal ring, saying that she'll remain his wife until he dies. Feng Jiu said that it was too late, gave Dong Hua back the ring, and left. After she left, Dong Hua coughed up blood and told Zhong Lin, his housekeeper, to give the ring to Feng Jiu after he's gone. Feng Jiu stayed in the Underworld, as not many people knew of Gun Gun's, her son, existence. Later, Qing Ti came to see her and told her that Dong Hua named him his successor, causing Feng Jiu to leave in panic. Gu Chou explained that the only time a powerful deity will name his successor is when that deity is about to die. Feng Jiu came to Tai Chen Palace and Zhong Lin told her the truth of that year. It turned out that Ji Heng used her father's life-saving grace against Dong Hua, asking him to divorce Feng Jiu and never marry. Dong Hua refused and cured Ji Heng's poison by transferring it to himself and returned her to her position as Princess of the Red Demon Clan, thus ending the debt. Dong Hua sent two letters with Chi Wu to tell the others to postpone the wedding and explain everything to Feng Jiu, but Chi Wu met with an enemy on the way and ended up in a coma for several months. Once Dong Hua knew, he rushed to find Feng Jiu, but at that time, the Hui Ming Realm began to collapse. Zhong Lin told Feng Jiu that Dong Hua had never reincarnated as a mortal, but had been preparing to purify the Hui Ming Realm. However, now he has chosen to stabilize it at the cost of his life. Zhong Lin then gave her the ring and said that it was made from half of Dong Hua's heart. Feng Jiu rushed to the Holy Blue Sea to find Dong Hua fighting with the demoness of the Hui Ming Realm, Miao Luo. Dong Hua had created a barrier to keep everyone out, but Feng Jiu managed to enter because of the ring. She ended up injured and laid dying in Dong Hua's arms. All hope of saving the two seemed lost until Bai Qian, Ye Hua, and Mo Yuan appeared, broke the barrier, and sealed off the dark energy of the Hui Ming Realm. Back in the Underworld, Gun Gun woke and Gu Chou took him to Feng Jiu's room, causing father and son to finally meet.

He represented Doubs in the National Assembly and then the Chamber of Deputies from 1871 to 1880. He was Governor-General of Algeria from 1879 to 1881, and a Senator for Life from 1880 until his death in 1899. Birth and family Albert Gr√©vy was born on 23 August 1823 in Mont-sous- Vaudrey, Jura. His paternal grandfather, Nicolas Gr√©vy (1736‚Äì1812), was the son of farmers in Aumont, moved to Mont-sous-Vaudrey during the French Revolution and bought the property of la Grangerie. He was a justice of the peace. His parents were Fran√ßois Hyacinthe Grevy (1773‚Äì1857) and Jeanne Gabrielle Planet (1782‚Äì1855). Albert's father had become chief of a battalion of volunteers in the Year II and had fought for the Republic until the Consulate. He operated a tile factory on his property. Albert was the younger brother of Jules Gr√©vy (1807‚Äì1891), the future President of France. His other brother was Paul Louis Jules Grevy(fr) (1820‚Äì1914), who became General of Division and was elected to the Senate in 1880 to represent Jura. He also had three older sisters. Albert Gr√©vy married Marie Cambeur (1830‚Äì1919). They had a son, L√©on Louis Gabriel Gr√©vy (b. 1853), who became a Master of Requests at the Council of State. Lawyer (1850‚Äì70) Albert Gr√©vy followed his older brother Jules in studying at the Faculty of Law of Paris, and enrolled at the Paris bar. Gr√©vy made an impressive debut in the Conf√©rence des avocats (1850‚Äì52). Gr√©vy was a member of the Conf√©rence Mol√© debating society in 1851. From 1852 he practiced in Besan√ßon, where he became B√¢tonnier. He contributed to the journal Le Doubs. As leader of the democratic opposition to the government of the Second French Empire he openly fought the plebiscite of 8 May 1870 in a series of meetings at the Grand-Th√©√¢tre in Besan√ßon. Due to his moderate Republican views on 6 October 1870 the Government of National Defense appointed him Commissioner General in the departments of Doubs, Jura and Haute-Sa√¥ne, but he soon left this position. Deputy (1871‚Äì80) Gr√©vy was elected Representative for Doubs in the National Assembly on 8 February 1871. He won by 36,910 votes out of 53,134. He sat with the Opportunist Republican parliamentary group, Gauche r√©publicaine, of which he became president. He supported the government of Adolphe Thiers and took part in several important debates. He was rapporter of the law on apportionment of compensation for acts of war, the commission of inquiry into Bonapartist actions (Girerd Affair), draft law on the press and the raising on the state of siege. He tried to pull together the various left-wing minority factions to work together on passing the constitutional laws. He opposed the government of 24 May 1873, and spoke against the septennat, state of siege, law on mayors and the ministry of Albert de Broglie. Gr√©vy was elected Deputy for Doubs on 20 February 1876. He ran for the first district of Besan√ßon and won 6,985 out of 9,095 votes. He was again president of the Republican left. He handed over this position to M. Leblond on 24 January 1877 but remained a member of the executive committee of the group. In 1877 he was vice-chairman of the budget committee. After the 16 May 1877 crisis he was one of the 363 opponents of the Fourtou‚ÄìDe Broglie ministry. Gr√©vy was reelected on 14 October 1877, holding office until 15 March 1880. He won 8,282 votes against 1,579 votes for the official candidate and monarchist M. Boysson d'Ecole. He was appointed a member of the Commission of Inquiry into the election and voted for invalidation of the elections of several deputies of the right. He supported the Dufaure cabinet and spoke in favour of the Jules Ferry laws on education. Governor-General of Algeria (1879‚Äì81) The arrival in Algiers of Albert Gr√©vy, Governor General of Algeria, 27 April 1879 By decree of 15 March 1879, renewed on 15 September 1879, Gr√©vy was temporarily assigned the position of Governor-General of Algeria. This was the first attempt to have a civilian in charge of civil and political life in Algeria, sponsored by Gr√©vy's brother Jules Gr√©vy, President of France. It was strongly criticized by the conservatives. Gr√©vy encountered difficulties that included the need to suppress a revolt of the Kabyle people in Batna in May 1879. There were frequent conflicts with the military authorities, which were often discussed in parliament. He also had disagreements with the General Secretary of Algeria. Gr√©vy was a conscientious and hard-working administrator, but his obsession with detail led to delays when action was needed. He was the first governor to be neither a general nor an admiral, and this may have encouraged a revolt that broke out in the south of Oran Province. In March 1881 he responded as government commissioner to the interpellation by the deputy Gaston Thomson on the arbitrary imprisonment of Arabs in Constantine Province. On 30 June 1881 he was attacked by R√©my Jacques for having caused the insurrection in Sud-Oran through his negligence. Gr√©vy's system of open receptions at the government palace was also criticized. The assorted civilians who invaded the functions were not always well-behaved, and sometimes squabbled over food at the buffet. Guests were later only admitted with invitation cards, which had to be presented at the door. The \\"decrees of attachment\\" of 6 September 1881 markedly diminished Gr√©vy's powers by giving control of many services to the relevant ministries. He was replaced as civil governor of Algeria on 26 November 1881 by Louis Tirman. Senator for Life (1880‚Äì99) Reinach, Rouvier, Roche, Deloncle, Gr√©vy and Guyot. La Libre Parole illustr√©e, 21 September 1895 On 6 March 1880 Gr√©vy was elected to the Senate as a Senator for Life in place of Adolphe Cr√©mieux, who had died. He received 152 votes out of 159. He sat with the left when his duties as Governor of Algeria allowed. Gr√©vy was particularly interested in colonial questions, and was naturally a member of the Colonial Committee. He voted with the Republican majority, and voted for divorce, for the exile of the princes, for the new military law, for reinstatement of the district poll (13 February 1889) and for the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press. He abstained on the process to be followed by the Senate against General Boulanger. Gr√©vy was implicated in the Panama scandals, and on 20 December 1892 the government asked parliament to authorise his prosecution. He obtained dismissal of the case on 7 February 1893. The cases against Deputy Maurice Rouvier and Senators Gr√©vy, Paul Dev√®s and L√©on Renault(fr) were dismissed based on lack of evidence. Poor health effectively removed Gr√©vy from Senate activity as early as 1892. He died in his house in Mont-sous-Vaudrey on 10 July 1899 at the age of 76.

Recreation Bukbhara Baor is one of the main natural attractions of Jessore Sadar Upazila due to its scenic surroundings and biodiversity. A large number of visitors come here every year. It is one of the largest sources of freshwater fishes. Fishing including recreational fishing is done by visitors. Other recreational activities include boating, canoeing, swimming in summer and migratory bird watching in winter. Fish production The lake is home to many different varieties of (Ruhi, Catla, Grass Carp, Labeo boga, and Tilapia) including sport fish (Sperata aor and many more). About 38 species of freshwater fish are found in the water of this lake. A total number of 352 fishermen earn their livelihoods by doing fishing in this lake. They work as a group fishermen. In every group, 10 to 11 fishermen work together. All of the Baors of Bangladesh are regulated under the management either managed by the GOB or the private leaseholders, which are known as community base fisheries management (CBFM). There are two groups of authority in this lake management, the Lake Fisheries Team (LFT) and the Fish Farmers Group (FFG), which work at the primary operational level. A Lake Management Group (LMG) works at the collective level. LTF/FFG is involved with the operation of Lake Fishery or pond culture within Lake Boundary while LMG is the control body, this looks after the interest of all member fishers in the lake in general. There is also a low facility landing center at the Chandutia Bazar which has been built by the Ministry of Fisheries. After meeting the local demand, fishes are supplied all across the country including Dhaka. In the year 2003, the government earned 1,50,0000 takas as revenue just from fisheries of the baor which was paid as lease money. Military training Since it is located near the Cantonment, Winter Collective Training of the 55 Infantry Division of Bangladesh Army is exercised on the surrounding ground of the lake. The Prime Minister of Bangladesh has appeared and commissioned junior officers on such event.

Life and education  Lerner was born and raised in the ethnic neighborhood of Humboldt Park on Chicago's west side. Interested in art as a child, he took classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) at age twelve, and won a scholarship there in 1946. He joined a student body composed largely of older G.I. Bill veterans, including Leon Golub, Cosmo Campoli and Seymour Rosofsky. Many of them would be collectively dubbed the \\"Monster Roster\\" by critic Franz Schulze in the late 1950s, for their expressionist figurative work, and regarded as forerunners to the more widely known and organized Imagists.Adrian, Dennis. \\"Introduction,\\" in Monster Roster: Existentialist Art in Postwar Chicago, John Corbett, Jim Dempsey, Jessica Moss, and Richard A.

Lerner studied under painters Louis Ritman and Boris Anisfeld, earning his BFA (1951) and MFA (1952) at SAIC. During this time, he exhibited in the seminal Momentum Exhibitions of 1948-1950, organized by SAIC and Institute of Design students in protest over their exclusion from the Art Institute's prestigious \\"Annual Exhibition by Artists of Chicago and Vicinity.\\" After graduating, Lerner won a foreign travel fellowship (1952)Art Institute of Chicago, 1952 Press Releases, June 9, 1952. Retrieved April 7, 2018. and a Fulbright grant (1957), which took him for a year to Rome and to Florence, respectively. The experience left an enduring mark; his studies of Renaissance and Baroque art, as well as classical literature like Dante, took his developing work in figurative, mythological and mystical directions, while solidifying his classically influenced aesthetics. Travel would exert a strong influence throughout his career, inspiring a decade-plus shift to landscape painting in the late 1970s, and a return to the figure in the mid-1990s. In 1961, Lerner joined the art faculty at City Colleges of Chicago, where he would teach until retiring in 1996. Over the last five decades, he has been featured in solo exhibitions at the Jan Cicero, Walter Wickiser (New York), LIPA, and Printworks galleries, and shown at institutions including the Art Institute of Chicago, Smart Museum of Art, Hyde Park Art Center,Glatt, Cara. \\"Six Chicago Artists,\\" Hyde Park Herald, May 1984. Chicago Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art, and Chicago Cultural Center, which honored him with a solo show in 2000. Lerner continues to work and live, with his wife, artist Carole Harmel, in Chicago.  Work  Lerner's work reflects both a deep connection to art history and a commitment to his own deeply personal path. Fusing his regard for Rembrandt, Renaissance and Baroque masters, Degas, expressionists like Soutine, and modernists like Francis Bacon and Giacometti, he developed an introspective, intuitive style that suggests but eludes labels like Expressionism, Impressionism, Surrealism, Fantasy, Classicism, or Realism. Hallmarks of his style are his atmospheric modelling, restrained palette, and intense, bleaching light, which often creates a diaphanous space in which subjects appear \\"inexplicably muted as if viewed through a mist or scrim\\" or seem to hover \\"somewhere between mirage and dream.\\"Postiglione, Corey. \\"Images of Quiet Intensity,\\" Walter Wickiser Gallery, catalogue, 1993.Pieszak, Devonna. \\"Arthur Lerner,\\" Catalogue essay, Galerija, Chicago, IL, 1983.

His early work, influenced by Expressionism, mythology, and the existentialism of Sartre and Camus, consisted of frontal paintings and cont√© drawings that featured isolated, fantastical creatures (Phoenix, 1955; Harpy, 1957), anguished heads (Screaming Head, 1962), or agonized, cadaver-like figures (the Torn series, 1960-2), often dissolving into painterly color-field backgrounds.Donato, Marla. \\"Gallery Tripping: Chicago Artists Expose Themselves,\\" Chicago Reader, May 20, 1983.

Hunt (1963) and Anna Werbe (Detroit, 1964) galleries, Elmhurst College (1972), and Alverno College (1973). Over time, Giacometti's influence on Lerner grew and his work became more detached and ethereal, with \\"substantiality and concreteness displaced by diffusion of light\\" and color suppressed in favor of tonality and pale hue.Polanski, G. Jurek. \\"Significant Signifiers, Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art,\\" ArtScope, 2001. Retrieved June 27, 2018. The shift, glimpsed in portraits, such as Laura I (1975), continued into the 1990s when Lerner returned to the figure after abandoning it for roughly a decade. Inspired by a visit to The Museum of the Mummies in Guanajuato, Mexico, he began exploring the beauty of decay and the feelings evoked by death through depictions of mummified, skeletal or hanged figures, corpses, and mythological subjects.Silverman, Lanny. \\"In Transition,\\" Chicago Cultural Center, exhibition essay, 2000.

Arthur Lerner, Bones, Gourd and Shells, oil on linen, 48\\" x 60\\", 1990. = Still lifes = In the late 1970s, Lerner made a major shift to still lifes and landscapes, prompted by a trip to the French maritime Alps, and later cemented after the purchase of a summer home in coastal Maine. Upon returning to Chicago, he began working on minimalist paintings of paper bags (1978) that, formally, recalled the mountains for him. He then turned to spare groupings of natural materials like rocks, shells, driftwood, leaves, bones and gourds that have been likened to Zen gardens in their \\"calculated casualness,\\" careful arrangement, and spatial tension. Contrasting them to his other work, Lerner describes the still lifes as \\"a more direct approach to the pure pleasure of looking at things.\\" Like the landscapes that would follow, these new paintings were simultaneously more precise and concrete‚Äîsometimes suggesting the detachment of Philip Pearlstein‚Äîand yet more abstract. Critics attributed this to Lerner's \\"opalescent light,\\"Holg, Garrett. \\"Contemporary Realism,\\" New Art Examiner, February 1984, p.18. which gave his shadows palpable form and created the \\"effect of a hazy, delicately colored, and possibly mystical procession of shapes across the canvas\\" that suggested landscapes. This artistic fiction transformed what appeared to be simple paintings, such as Bones, Gourds and Shells (1990), into metaphysical works that evoked a mood of mystery and quietude critics likened to the work of Giorgio Morandi. Arthur Lerner, Canyon Series V, oil on linen, 50\\" x 72\\", 1996. = Landscapes = Concurrent with the still lifes, Lerner began painting Maine coastscapes. Describing the contrast between Maine's \\"dramatic, almost brooding landscape\\" and Chicago's urban unruliness as \\"a kind of epiphany,\\" he said, \\"I became drawn into the more spiritual, psychological and atmospheric qualities and the sense of oneness that pervades everything in nature.\\" Critics described these new paintings as \\"landscapes of wonderment\\" and \\"hard-headed poetry\\";Artner, Alan G. \\"Blaze of Illumination Turns Heads in Delight,\\" Chicago Tribune, June 9, 1988. and compared them to the work of Hopper and Rothko, noting Lerner's use of light as an agent of transformation to harmonize what he sees in nature. In reviews covering four shows at Jan Cicero Gallery (1986-1997), Alan Artner observed that the light alternately gave \\"shadows the solidity of rock and rock the buoyancy of snow\\" or bleached out land and seascapes in its intensity, detaching them from their natural contexts.Artner, Alan G. Exhibition critique, Chicago Tribune, May 3, 1991. He wrote that paintings like Coastscape Series III (1985-6) revealed keen observation, yet diverged from reality to create a sense of feeling and atmosphere that became almost abstract. In later series, Lerner focused on the brighter reds, yellows and blues of Arizona's red rock country and the subtler palettes of the Grand Canyon, in works like Canyon Series V (1996).  Teaching  Lerner began his teaching career at Ray-Vogue College, a commercial art school in Chicago, in 1955. He worked there until 1957, teaching fine arts, illustration and design. In 1961, he was hired at City Colleges of Chicago, where he would teach basic drawing, figure drawing, and painting until his retirement in 1996. He was named Distinguished Professor, Richard J. Daley College in 1986‚Äì7. Lerner modeled his approach on that of his own SAIC figure drawing teacher, Robert Lifvendahl, taking a highly structured approach to teaching foundational technique and methods to a broad spectrum of students that included college teens, blue-collar workers, and retirees. Lerner also taught at Ox-Bow School of Art, School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1961.

He was the personal physician to Queen Christina and King Charles X Gustav of Sweden. He is most known for his book, Sundhetzens Speghel, which is considered to be the best medical book of the century, and is sometimes considered to be the first Swedish cookbook.  Life  Andreas Sparman was born Andreas Schomerus in Sparrs√§tra parish, Uppsala County, Sweden. He died in Stockholm. When he wrote his dissertation in 1629, he used the name \\"Schomerus\\", but later changed his name to Sparrman, for his birthplace. He was knighted in 1647 with the name Palmcron. Sparman's father was Nikolaus Olai. His mother was Susanna Andersdotter. His first wife was Helena Isaksdotter. His second wife was Susanna Lilliecrona. He had a daughter, Brita Susanna Palmkron, with his second wife. Sparman studied medicine in the city of Leiden, in the Netherlands. After he returned to Sweden he became the city doctor for Stockholm. Later, he was the personal doctor to Queen Christina and Charles X Gustav of Sweden.  Books  Sundhetzens Speghel (1642) In connection with the plague epidemic in 1638, Sparman wrote an educational book about the plague. It was a summary of how to prevent and treat the disease. It was published again during plague epidemics in 1652 and 1710. In 1642, Sparman wrote the most complete book ever published about preventive health care, Sundhetzen's Speghel, uthi hwilken man beskodhar Sundhetzens Natur,... or \\"Mirror of Health, from which one may learn the nature of health, the principle causes of all diseases which chiefly undermine health, together with the remedies which deliver us from them\\". It is considered the best l√§kebok or medical book of the century. Part of the book is written in the form of the alexandrine French poetry meter. It was probably based on some foreign works.

It was written by Thomas and James Spradley, Lynn's father and uncle, and originally published in 1979. It begins in November 1964, before Lynn was born, and ends in August 1975, when she was ten. A short epilogue by Lynn, 19-years-old, is included in the 1985 edition.  Background and publication  This biography focuses on Tom and Louise Spradley, their children Bruce and Lynn, and the friends and family they interact with on their journey. The book begins in 1964 when the Spradley's are moving from Illinois to Minnesota and Bruce is an only child. Tom is a teacher and is willing to take a job in any city offered, so he and his family move from Illinois, to Minnesota, to Oklahoma, and finally to California, where most of Lynn's schooling takes place. Louise is a stay at home parent, so she is flexible to move around the country without many issues. Deaf Like Me was originally published as a hardcover edition by Random House in 1979. The paperback edition was published in 1985 by Gallaudet University Press, with the addition of Lynn Spradley's epilogue.  Main characters  * Tom Spradley is the husband of Louise and the father of Bruce and Lynn and also the narrator of this story. He is a mathematics teacher at the college level and for a short time, the high school level. When the book begins, Tom is working at Wheaton College in Illinois and works there for four years. However, over the course of the book, he also works at Carleton College in Minnesota, University of Oklahoma, Northview High School and American River College, both in California. Tom is the sole provider for the Spradley family, since he is the only one with a paying job. * Louise Spradley is the wife of Tom and mother of Bruce and Lynn. She is a stay at home mom who takes care of her children and occasionally paints. Louise's role as a stay at home mom is crucial because she is able to devote so much of her time to working with Lynn and teaching her how to lip-read. Her role as a stay at home mom enables their family to move around the country without many limitations. * Bruce Spradley is the son of Tom and Louise and the brother of Lynn. His role in this book is fairly minimal but he experienced a similar life to the rest of his family. Bruce is about four years older than Lynn and seems to have had a relatively normal childhood. He is adaptable and is able to make new friends regardless of the state he lives in. Also, Bruce helps teach his sister to lip-read and learn sign language. * Lynn Spradley is the daughter of Tom and Louise, the sister of Bruce, and is also the main character and reason behind the creation of this biography. Lynn was born profoundly deaf due to her mother's exposure to rubella early in her pregnancy. There is nothing mentally or physically wrong with Lynn besides the fact that she cannot hear.  Plot  In 1964, Bruce, who was only around three years old, contracted rubella or German measles. In 1964 and 1965, there was a large rubella outbreak where ‚Äú20,000 babies were born with congenital rubella syndrome‚Äù and the vaccination was not put in use until 1969. Bruce quickly recovered, however, Tom and Louise are concerned that if Louise is pregnant and contracted the illness, it could cause their child to have birth defects like the doctor warned them. In April 1965, Louise gave birth to Lynn and the doctor performed various tests and assured the Spradley's that Lynn was perfectly healthy. Every newborn baby now has their hearing screened before they leave the hospital, however, this procedure was not put into place until 1993. Tom and Louise accepted the doctor's assessment and continued on with their lives until the Fourth of July, they became concerned because Lynn was not bothered by the wailing fire trucks or the bursting fireworks. When she was 16 months old, Lynn's hearing was tested at the John Tracy Clinic and she was found to be profoundly deaf. Once Lynn's deafness is proven to be true, Tom and Louise begin teaching her how to lip-read as opposed to how to sign. Oralism, which only allows children to speak not sign, was popular because people believed deaf children could one day talk just as well as hearing children. Before Lynn was old enough to get a hearing aid, she used an auditory trainer, consisting of headphones, a microphone, and a control box, all used to amplify sounds. Once she was the right age, Lynn received a hearing aid that took time for her to get accustomed to, but unfortunately did not provide much assistance. The point of both the auditory trainer and the hearing aids were for Lynn to learn how to use her residual hearing, the small amount of hearing abilities even someone with hearing loss has. As Lynn got older, communication continued to become more of an issue for her and her family. She would have tantrums when those around her could not figure out what she was asking for. Tom and Louise attended meetings at her schools and found that other parents had similar issues with communication but had not found many ways to resolve them. A few months before Lynn turned five, Tom and Louise began to realize that despite many years of lip-reading and trying to get their daughter to talk, she could only speak a few words and only lip-read common words. The Spradley's decided they wanted more for Lynn, so they began to learn sign language from some of their deaf friends. The whole family quickly picked up the language and realized how easy it now was to communicate with Lynn. She continued to learn to lip-read, but signing only improved Lynn's abilities.  Epilogue  The epilogue, included at the back of the book in the paperback edition, was written by Lynn Spradley in 1985. In the epilogue, she mostly talks about the school she attended after learning sign language. Lynn went to a residential school for the deaf, from age twelve to age nineteen, when she wrote this piece. Lynn mentions that she is glad she was given the opportunity to learn sign language and states, ‚ÄúDeaf kids are just as smart as hearing kids. With sign language deaf kids can do anything.‚Äù  References  Category:1979 non-fiction books ","title":"Deaf Like Me"},{"id":"57231452","text":"Sorbinipercidae is an extinct family of zeiid fish from the Eocene of Monte Bolca.

It was strongly connected with Eastern European cultures from Dnieper Basin. It derived by Stefan K. Koz≈Çowski in 1964 and it is named after the Janislawice site near Skierniewice.  Chronology, genesis and disappearance.  The Janislawice culture existed from the second half of 6th millennium a.C. to as late as 4th millennium a.C. Its origins are studied mainly by its technology of producing flint tools. The best analogical traces lead south to the Pontic area, where technique of crafting tools, characteristic for the Janislawice culture, is known before 6th millennium a.C. Disappearing process of this complex spanned between 4th and 3rd millennium a.C. This process was characterised by the decline of basic elements of this material culture and their replacement with new elements coming from various directions, which was associated with spread of neolithisation process (influenced by the Funnel Beaker culture and the Globular Amphorae culture).  Janislawice groups and their territorial reach.  The Janislawice culture co-existed with adjacent contemporary cultures, e.g. the Chojnice group along the middle Warta river or the Neman culture). In the Janislawice complex S.K. Koz≈Çowski derived groups/cultures located in: * The Wistka group ‚Äì extending into the Warsaw-Berlin Proglacial Stream Valley, the Vistula Basin, the region between Warsaw and Toru≈Ñ, the part of Niecka Nidzia≈Ñska region, Sandomierz Basin, the middle part of Narew and Bug rivers. * The eastern group ‚Äì spanning the Niemen Basin, the upper Pripet, the Narew and Bug Basins, Sandomierz Basin, the Niecka Nidzia≈Ñska region, the Cracow Gate, the upper Warta and the region between Proglacial Stream Valley and the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains. * The Maksimonys group (now culture) ‚Äì encompassing mainly the middle Niemen Basin and the Biebrza Basin. In the given area, on the verge of the Wistka and the eastern groups there are sites which have features from both groups.  Characteristic features of material culture.  In the Janislawice culture technology of producing flint tools is characterised by precision workmanship. From precisely prepared conical and subconical cores regular long blades were produced. The blades were quite large for the Mesolithic standards. The basic tools group contains regular blade cores, scrapers on flakes, truncations, retouched blades, triangles, Janislawice-type points and trapezes formed from partially broken blades. This culture also contained bone products, usually ornamented by notching, used mainly for making knives and blades. From the Janislawice culture also comes a bone and antler tools and necklace made from animal teeth.  Settlements and economy.  The Janislawice culture sites are located mainly on river terraces. The Janislawice people represented typical Mesolithic model of economy ‚Äì hunting, gathering and fishing. In this culture flint mining was also present. People needed good-quality and large enough flint raw material sufficient for their tools production. The chocolate flint from eastward of the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains was frequently used. The mine discovered in Tomasz√≥w, Szyd≈Çowiec County and the part of mines in Oro≈Ñsko are the proof that this kind of flint was mined by people from the Janislawice culture. On the Rydno XII/59 site in Grzybowa G√≥ra, Skar≈ºysko County, which is directly connected with a hematite mine, an oval-shaped semi-dugout dwelling (type of primitive habitation structure) with a fireplace laid out with flat stones was unearthed.  Burial tradition.  In the Janislawice site Laponoidal a male grave was unearthed. It contained rich burial inventory, the whole set of items associated with the Janislawice culture, including: 21 microliths, cores, blades, an animal teeth necklace, bone and antler tools. Two more graves were discovered in the Gi≈ºycko-Perkunowo site in Masuria also with Laponoidal people. Their inventory included animal teeth necklaces, a flint retouched truncation and a trimming blade. All known Janislawice culture burials have ochre in the fill so it was surely part of burial rite of the Janislawice people.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Borg (binder of Rho GTPases) family of CDC42 effector proteins. Borg family proteins contain a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive- binding) domain. They bind to CDC42 and regulate its function negatively. The encoded protein may inhibit c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) independently of CDC42 binding. The protein may also play a role in septin organization and inducing pseudopodia formation in fibroblasts [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013].

(Original description) The white shell is covered with a pale olivaceous periostracum. It contains five or more well-rounded whorls exclusive of the (lost) protoconch. These show a rounded shoulder and a distinct but not appressed suture. The axial sculpture consists of, on the spire, obscure nodulations at the shoulder (about 15 on the penultimate whorl) which do not form ribs and are absent from the body whorl. The incremental lines are fine but obscure. Beside these there are minute, anteriorly obliquely retractive lines somewhat microscopically reticulated by the lines of growth.tTere is no spiral sculpture except on some specimens a few obsolete lines on the base. The anal sulcus is shallow, slightly removed from the suture. The fasciole is lightly impressed on the body whorl. The aperture is narrow. The outer lip is thin, sharp and arcuately produced. The inner lip is erased. The columella is white, solid straight, anteriorly obliquely attenuated.

She was born in 1942 in Balikesir.  Life and works  Due to her fathers encouragement she attended Law School. However, due to her interest in art, when her second academic year started she stopped with Law School and started to study for the Art School exams unbeknownst to her father. She was accepted to the State Fine Arts Academy (MSGS√ú) and graduated from its Higher Sculpture Department. Between 1974 and 1978 she worked as an assistant in that same department. In the 70's she opened her first personal exhibition. In 1973 she was one of the 20 artists chosen to make works in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Republic and her artwork stayed at 4. Levent for a limited time. In 1977 she completed the degree of academic qualification with thesis in her field on () \\"light and transparency in sculpture\\" Between the years 1978‚Äì1980 and 1983‚Äì1984 she continued her sculpture career in New York City. Between the years 1978‚Äì1980 she worked together with Art Students League sculptor Jose De Cleft. In 1987 she participated in the Istanbul Biennial. In 1990 the Ankara Art Foundation awarded her the Sculptor of the Year award. In 1999 she opened a personal exhibition in ƒ∞stanbul. One year later her works went on exhibit in the Ay≈üe and Erc√ºmend Kalmƒ±k Museum (). Her later exhibitions took place at the ƒ∞stanbul Ma√ßka Art Gallery and Galeri Nev in Ankara. In 2006 she celebrated 35 years in art. Around those years her works were exhibited as part of the exhibition named\\"Memory and Scale: 15 Artists of Modern Turkish Sculpture\\" () at ƒ∞stanbul Modern. In 2008 she was awarded the Aydƒ±n Doƒüan Foundation Sculpture Award. While she received the award she said \\"I'm happy, a wo man artist and sculptor is receiving an award\\"(). In her art career she worked much on square, circle and triangle formed abstract-geometric iron creations. Besides iron she also tried out materials such as timber, stone and plexiglass. In some of his works she made reference to Russian Constructivists and Naum Gabo's search for global forms. In the 1990s her works with iron masses shaped in such a way that sharp edges would form by cutting and folding different polygonal forms were approaching a more minimalist style. Some of her floor sculptures consist of black iron plates. In her wall sculptures she preferred fiberglass over iron. Especially in recent times she worked with \\"broken rectangles\\" affected by circular movements. Her floor sculptures generally conformin to gravity with a downwards motion, however some in contrast reach up.

In contrast to the Dax with lying engine, the engine of the CY 50 is installed standing. As a larger, but much rarer encountered model, the Honda CY 80 was imported. With comparable engine technology, the road version Honda CB 50 and the Enduro version XL 50 was built.  Features  As a special feature was advertised that \\"... it does not need a fuel-oil mixture, but regular gasoline. This keeps the engines clean right up to the exhaust.

For example, the five-fold adjustable rear struts to adjust the spring preload to the payload, a trip meter in speedometer and a six-liter tank, which allowed a range of about 200 kilometers. Rear and front luggage carriers themselves allowed a versatile labor input, for example, in the transport of various hobby equipments. Unscrewable front and rear wheel rims allow comprehensive care, immediate hose repair and a light coat change in trouble-free self-assembly.  Vulnerabilities  A weak point of the model are the factory-rigid mounting tubes of the front and rear turn signals, which is why it already comes in light falls to significant damage, especially on the front indicators and their suspension (see picture). The valve seats with valve rings manufactured at that time and the installed valves require that the engine be lead predominantly or at least occasionally with tetraethyl lead which is no longer available at service stations normal and premium gasoline is driven.im als Zubeh√∂r mitausgelieferten Fahrerhandbuch, S. 25 : ‚ÄûVerwenden sie Benzin mit geringem Bleigehalt ‚Äú A declaration by the manufacturer authorized statement that prolonged operation without lead added in the fuel will definitely damage the engine concerned sooner or later is not known. However, from a list posted by Honda on the Internet, it can be seen that the CY50 can also be run on regular unleaded gasoline. The design-related performance of generator (flywheel generator) with six-volt electrics was not designed to ensure that this Mokick is always driven with switched on lighting in the Federal Republic of Germany, as required by later amendments to StVO. Therefore, with this alternator under this driving mode, especially in the case of predominantly short-distance traffic, the optimum charging of the standard accumulators (on- board battery 6 V, 4 Ah) while driving no longer guaranteed, which may lead after some time with each 21-watt bulbs (6 V) operated turn signals lose their function.

The PN triangle retains the vertices of the flat triangle as well as the corresponding normals. It was first introduced by A. Vlachos et al. in 2001 and is primarily used in the field of computer graphics.

Biography Roberto Merino studied at the National Institute and, after completing secondary education, he continued with Literature at the University of Chile, where he graduated with a thesis on the work of poet Juan Luis Mart√≠nez. He has worked at the magazines APSI, Don Bal√≥n (where he wrote sports chronicles), Fibra, ', and '. He has been the editor of Patagonia, the newspaper ', and chronicler of Las √öltimas Noticias and El Mercurio. He founded Ediciones Carlos Porter, which published, among others, . He compiled the Antolog√≠a del humor literario chileno (2002, Sudamericana), and edited the complete columns and chronicles of Joaqu√≠n Edwards Bello. He is a professor of the Faculty of Communication and Literature at Diego Portales University. Since 2014 he has been part of the rock band Ya Se Fueron, in which he is the oldest member and his son Clemente the youngest. Asked what experience he would choose, more with music than with writing, he answered in March 2015: \\"If I could, yes, but it is an answer that I give at this time. It is the newest enthusiasm. I would love to. Music has the fascination of the confluence, of the collective. Which is totally opposite to the solitude of writing. One ends relaxed, physically very well. And writing is horrendous. One ends up tense, with his back complete shit. It is totally unnatural from the physical point of view.\\" The father of two children and separated, Merino lives in the Providencia neighborhood, where he frequents the Tavelli cafe. On his image, he comments: \\"Sometimes I do not know if this aspect has to do with the late hippieism of the 70s or with a certain nineteenth-century pomposity. I have had a beard since I was sixteen. I do not want to shave anymore; I do not want to know which face I'm going to find underneath.\\" Literary career Roberto Merino entered Chilean literature at the end of the 1980s as a poet, but his fame is mainly due to his chronicles. His decision to become a writer was made as a teenager, \\"at 16\\". \\"It was an explicit decision. I thought that I could only do that and I was already living as a writer; I already thought as a writer. There were not even hesitations, despite family apprehensions about my economic future, which were completely reasonable,\\" Merino confessed in 2014. His first poem was written at the age of six. \\"And then at nine, at 11, and at 14\\". In 1981, came up with the idea of forming Chamico, and one of its members was Merino, who defined it as \\"a literary shock group, quite Patagonian and inorganic,\\" \\"a parody of Surrealist Mandragora.\\" \\"In the end, it was just a joke that lasted a few months.\\" Merino explains that \\"the chamico is a toxic weed which makes the cows sick, and also it was likened to marijuana of bad quality.\\" Floating members of the group were Antonio de la Fuente, Perico Cordovez, Alejandro Perez, Juan Pedro Broussein, Lira, and Merino. The first book published by Merino was Trasmigraci√≥n, which Enrique Lihn would describe as, \\"a book of poetry written in anti-prosaic prose.\\" Ten years later his second book of poems, Melancol√≠a artificial, came out, but between these, from the beginning of the 1990s, he was reborn as a chronicler, a genre he practiced for the first time at age 13, in 1974. That year, for the South American Athletics, he joined the cyclists who followed the marathoners, and when he returned home, \\"he took a notebook and wrote what he had lived. His first chronicle. Merino would forget the genre\\" until, 15 years later, Hoy magazine asked him to write about the city. Since then he has been best known as a chronicler, although he does not feel like such, and a \\"specialist in Santiago, less,\\" even though he has published several books on the Chilean capital with more than 160 chronicles. \\"I have no talent or patience for that,\\" says Merino, explaining why he does not write fiction. As for poetry, he confessed in December 2013: \\"I have not written poetry in a long time. I have not felt the need. I have not had the chance.

The writing team states they \\"wanted to honor [the slain miners] by getting all the details right [...] Idaho has never faced the moral depravity of that crime: over 30 immigrants tortured, mutilated, and killed in terrible ways.

Wilson served as partner of the firm alongside Sir Edward Harland, William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie and Gustav Wilhelm Wolff. During his time with Harland and Wolff, Wilson made many notable contributions to the development of shipbuilding. Wilson's developments are still considered today to have been the most reliable contributions of the time. Wilson was appointed to the Northern Counties Committee of Midland Railway and became President of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce in 1904 until his sudden death. Personal life Wilson lived at Stranmillis House before he bought a 20-year lease of Belvoir Park (which was ended in 1918) from Robert Wilfrid de Yarburgh- Bateson, 3rd Baron Deramore in 1900 and also bought Cranmore House, which was close to his original family property Maryville House. He married Sarah Elizabeth Wynne in 1875 and had one son and six daughters. His son, Alexander George Wilson (1876-1959), succeeded him in the ownership of his property in Belfast.

Oklahoma, 322 U.S. 596 (1944), was a United States Supreme Court case about the beatings and subsequent coerced confessions of William Douglas Lyons, a man convicted of a triple-murder in Oklahoma.. His attorneys included Thurgood Marshall.  History  William Douglas Lyons was a 21-year-old illiterate African American sharecropper. For several hours, Lyons was beaten with a blackjack weapon. Eventually he said he murdered a white family and burned down their home. Thurgood Marshall travelled to Oklahoma to assist the defense shortly after the trial of Joseph Spell. Marshall cross-examined the police who were involved. Marshall had a strong case asserting Lyon's innocence, however the judge allowed for a jury‚Äòs determination. The jury decided that the second confession by Lyon's given twelve hours after his beatings had ended, was a voluntary confession. The case was overshadowed by early events related to World War II and the court's decision on the Sherman Act. = Outcome = Lyons was paroled in 1961 and pardoned by the Governor of Oklahoma in 1965 after 25 years in prison. He subsequently disappeared into obscurity.LYONS V. OKLAHOMA, THE NAACP, AND COERCED Confessions Virginia Law Review 2003 pdf file Lyons was spared the death penalty in the case, despite the gruesome nature of the murder, after his defense exposed abuses by police and officials. Many observers thought he would be cleared after problems with the case against him were exposed at trial. Marshall was troubled by the outcome and believed there was strong evidence of his client's innocence. The case highlighted issues of what constituted a forced confession. Some observers also suggested the murder may have been carried out by poorly supervised prisoners at a nearby work camp and Lyons used as a scapegoat to avoid bad publicity and possible investigations of local law officers and politicians. A photo of Lyons with six policemen and attorneys is held by the Library of Congress. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court failed in a majority decision with a strong dissent to the effect that a series of beatings, long interrogations and threats to induce a confession do not render a second confession 11 hours later involuntary.

At the height of its circulation, it had over 9,000 readers and was translated into French and Russian as well as English. They received their information from new prisoners and smuggled in German newspapers and, most crucially, a secret radio. On some occasions, they were able to receive information faster than German media. When POW WOW received the news of the D-Day landings, they had to delay publication, because the prisoners‚Äô excitement would arouse suspicion.Parker, Ray, Down in Flames (Minneapolis: Mill City Press, 2009) p.100-101 POW WOW was started by Lowell Bennett, an American war correspondent, but he was discovered, and in April 1944 control of the paper was given to Ray Parker, an American pilot who had been shot down in April 1944.

He was also the longest-serving of Austrian imprisoned convicts. In the years 1971 and 1972 he committed, inter alia, six killings out of greed and served a life sentence in prison for them.  Life  Harald Sassak was the son of a bricklayer and an operator. He learned as a plumber and did his military service in the army from 1966 to 1969 in the Lainz hospital as an auxiliary. After he suffered from jaundice, he did not bring his employer medical confirmation and was therefore dismissed. He also gave up his subsequent job as a confectioner. He was described as very friendly and helpful by his family, friends and superiors. He always very well in school and did not receive any disciplinary sanctions from the army. When one day an elderly woman approached him, asking him if he could repair her gas appliance and then tipped him, he developed an idea he called the \\"gas trick.\\" Between August 31, 1970 and February 12, 1972, he spent time with elderly people as a servant of the gasworks, who wanted to check their equipment. As soon as he knew where the covert funds were, he diverted his victim, for example, by asking for a glass of water. If caught in the act, he killed his victim and fled. In some raids his accomplice Johann Sharaditsch, whom he had met in a liquor room, helped him. Surviving victims said that a chubby, nice man had asked for admission with the words: \\"The gas man is here!\\". He was always well dressed, and had a seemingly valid identity card and expertise. Only after the victims revealed their money caches did he strike them down and rob them. Except for a single fingerprint, which could not be assigned to any person from the police files, no trace of the offender was left. However, when a neighbour of one of the victims, a graphic designer, had a very accurate facial composite of the perpetrator made by the draftsman of the bureau, the search became more concrete. A waiter of the Reiser hotel recognized the man as Harald Sassak by the facial composite and led the officials to the culprit, who was drinking a glass of wine. One of his victims identified him at the hotel and Sassak was arrested. On the way to the office he confessed to his crimes. On January 22, 1974, Sassak's trial began, with the reading of the indictment taking more than an hour. He confessed to his crimes, but claimed he did not participate in any murders. The coroner said that 79-year old Richard Langer and 86-year old Josefa Fierlinger died as a direct result of the violence. 69-year old Aloisia Meschnark died of kidney failure 17 days after being hospitalized, 66-year old Rosa Schwarz after seven days of brain soreness, 86-year old Maria Aberle and 85-year old Eleonore Hauer after ten or 38 days of pneumonia. According to the report, there was a connection between the death of women and the use of force. Gabriele Hammer, who died 54 days after being attacked by Sassak, could no longer find evidence of violence. On February 7, 1974, Sassak was convicted of robbing Josefa Fierlinger, the predatory manslaughter of Richard Langer, Aloisia Meschnark, Rosa Schwarz, Maria Aberle and Eleonore Hauer, as well as robbery and theft in nine cases, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. His accomplice, Johann Sharaditsch, was guilty of theft, robbery in two cases and theft in two cases and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Sassak died on August 21, 2013, as a result of prolonged illness in a Lower Austrian nursing home, after being released from prison shortly after more than being 39 years behind bars.

Such choirs are typically church or civil society ventures that do not have political objectives. Some are, however, campaigning on homeless issues. As the name suggests, some street choirs sing on the street, taking political issues and their campaigns to people in public space or include members who live on the streets. Not all street choirs regularly sing on the street, however.  Choirs of homeless people   Political or campaigning choirs.  UK street choirs typically have their roots in social movements.

The Millennium Concert is a live album by the American hard rock band Kiss. It was released on November 21, 2006 as part of the Kiss Alive! 1975‚Äì2000 box set. Album information It was recorded on December 31, 1999 at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, Canada and included songs that had never before been performed by the original lineup (\\"Heaven's on Fire\\", \\"I Love It Loud\\" and \\"Lick It Up\\"). It was originally intended to be released as Alive IV in 2000 but was shelved when Kiss' parent label Mercury was swallowed by the Universal/Vivendi merger. However, the album's version of \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\" was included in The Box Set which was released on November 20, 2001. Although Universal later agreed to Kiss using Mercury to release what would become The Millennium Concert as Alive IV, it was shelved indefinitely and the band would release the Symphony: Alive IV album released on Kiss Records/Sanctuary Records in 2003. It was finally released on November 21, 2006 as part of the Kiss Alive! 1975‚Äì2000 box set. An edition of the box set exclusive to Best Buy was advertised as including two exclusive bonus tracks (2,000 Man and God of Thunder) on The Millennium Concert disc. But due to an error, Best Buy only sold the standard box set that did not have the exclusive bonus tracks. In an attempt to correct this, a replacement disc was produced and small quantities were shipped to Best Buy locations where the discs were given out to customers who came back to complain that their box did not include the promised extra tracks. Another bonus track, \\"Detroit Rock City\\", was released as an exclusive to the iTunes edition of the box set. In October 14, 2014 The Millennium Concert was released on vinyl. This edition was the first release to include the entire concert (except for \\"Cold Gin\\" and \\"Shock Me\\" which remain unreleased).
