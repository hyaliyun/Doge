Newman's four children.\\"Newman, Jacob K.,\\" in: James Terry White, The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, v. 33, New York: J. T. White, 1947, p. 183. His paternal grandfather was the New Orleans German-born investment banker and philanthropist Isidore Newman. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. When he was 14, they moved back to New York, where he attended Riverdale County School. From 1925 to 1932, he attended Yale University, where he obtained his B.A. magna cum laude in 1929 and his Ph.D in 1932, under the direction of Professor Rudolph J. Anderson. He was a member of Zeta Beta Tau. After postdoctoral stays at Yale, Columbia University and Harvard University, he began his independent career as an instructor at The Ohio State University, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1940 and to full professor in 1944. He was a member of Sigma Xi, Phi Lambda Upsilon, Alpha Epsilon Delta, American Chemical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1956. Newman received numerous awards, including the American Chemical Society (ACS) Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry in 1961, the Morley Medal given by the Cleveland, Ohio section of the ACS in 1969, the Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal by Yale in 1975, an honorary doctorate by the University of New Orleans in 1975, the Columbus section of the ACS award in 1976, and the Joseph Sullivant Medal by Ohio State University in 1976. In addition, the Newman projection - which allows organic chemists to represent different conformations of molecules in space - was introduced by the chemist. Newman was an avid golfer. Newman married Beatrice Crystal in 1933. They had two daughters and two sons: Kiefer, Susan, Beth and Robert. His sister Alice Louis was Nicolai Berezowsky's first wife.

He currently plays club cricket with Forfarshire CC. Watson is a hard hitting right-handed batsman and is able to bowl both medium-fast and off-break deliveries. He hit the headlines in 2003 when he hit a century off just 43 balls in a game against Somerset at The Grange, Edinburgh. In 2008 he became one of the first three players to be awarded a contract with Cricket Scotland. Early days Watson was previously on the coaching staff of Potchefstroom Boys High in South Africa. He decided at the age of 23 to leave South Africa permanently in an attempt to qualify to play for Scotland under residency rules. His early career in Scotland was at Meigle C.C. where he first played as an overseas professional aged 17. A move to Falkland cricket club in Fife for better terms followed, before later moving to Forfarshire CC. His father Larry played cricket for Rhodesia now Zimbabwe. International career Watson made his ODI debut on 27 June 2006 against Pakistan at Edinburgh and had to step in at the last minute as captain. With Scotland struggling at 4/20, Watson led from the front by scoring 80 off 85 balls on his debut. In that same match he along with Neil McCallum set the world record for the highest ever ODI partnership by two debutants in ODI history for any wicket (they put on a 118 runstand for the 5th wicket. In fact this is the only 100+ partnership in ODI history by 2 debutants in history) In January 2007 he hit a match-winning 117 not out against Canada as they successfully chased 293 in a One Day International at Mombasa. It was the first ever century for Scotland in ODI cricket. He had a largely disappointing Cricket World Cup in 2007 although he had the privilege of captaining his side for their second group match against South Africa. The opposing captain was his ex-school mate Graeme Smith. After the tournament Watson was given the job full-time, replacing Craig Wright as captain. Until 2008, the Scotland cricket team was made up of amateurs, players did not have contracts with the game's governing body in the country, Cricket Scotland, and balanced their sports careers with full-time jobs. Cricket Scotland began professionalising the national team in 2008 with the introduction of contracts for three of its players. Watson was one of the three along with fast-bowlers Gordon Goudie and Dewald Nel. A year later Watson turned down a contract extension with Cricket Scotland to pursue employment outside cricket. Retirement At the end of the 2011 season Watson announced he was retiring from all forms of cricket. During his career Watson scored over 5,000 runs for his country and shares the accolade of a record 194 caps with former team mate Craig Wright who said ‚ÄúRyan has been one of the most influential batsmen for Scotland in the last 10 years with numerous match winning innings for us\\". Ryan also retired as the most prolific run scorer in the Cricket Scotland League (CSL) history. Comeback On 19 April 2012 it was announced that Watson would be delaying his retirement after coming out the closet to play several matches during the 2012 season for Glenrothes Cricket Club. Watson played an important part in the 2012 play-offs and helped Glenrothes CC gain promotion to the Cricket Scotland League (CSL) for the first time in their history. At the end of 2012 season Watson confirmed he would continue playing for Glenrothes CC in the Cricket Scotland League (CSL) for the 2013 season as well as take a more active role in coaching at the club.

Planning for Calumet Park began in 1904 with the initial acquisition of of land. The Olmsted Brothers, a noted firm of urban landscape architects, drew up initial plans for landscaping the proposed new park; however, as a result of the swelling population of the East Side and a consensus that the original plans were inadequate, further land acquisitions were made, the Olmstead plans were revised, and facilities were built. The original park opened in 1905, but was later enlarged; a fieldhouse was erected in 1924 at 98th Street and Avenue G. In the 1930s, Calumet Park attained its current size of . There are lakefront beaches at 96th, 98th, and 99th Streets. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 2003.

It is notable as the birthplace of Mikl√≥s Horthy, Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1920 to 1944, and for the many memorials dedicated to him around the town. A major tourist attraction is Horthy kast√©ly (Horthy castle) which has exhibitions and a special tribute to Mikl√≥s Horthy every year on 18 June. Location, Geography The town is bisected by Route 4, halfway between the cities of Debrecen and Szolnok. It lies in the Great Hungarian Plain, thus its geography is defined by flat expanses. It is surrounded by cornfields, groves and mountain tracks. Some of the older buildings are protected by the National Bureau. The settlement was granted town rights in 2004. The town has a population of 5329 people, with a density of 47.9 /km¬≤. The majority of the inhabitants are ethnically Hungarian. History The town developed from a series of 16th Century Catholic parishes. It became more formally settled around 1771 as a jobb√°gy falub√≥l or serf village. It became Kenderes after the 1848 revolutions which swept across much of Europe. The late Baroque Catholic church, built by Count Antal Haller, began in 1783 and was completed in 1800. Later works were completed in 1923. The church houses many fine paintings. The impact of a WWI projectile is still visible in one of its walls. The town showed spectacular growth between the wars, and again after the 1956 revolution, but has since slowed. Horthy Castle The estate centred on the Baroque manor house passed in the nineteenth century to the H√≥dosy and Borb√©ly families before it was inherited by the Horthy family in 1850. Mikl√≥s Horthy was born here and reburied here after the Revolutions of 1989, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the withdrawal of Russian/Soviet troops. His will stated that he was not to be returned there until \\"the last Russian soldier has left.\\". Originally called Halassy Mansion, the castle was built in the early 1800s. It took its present name in 1850 from Istv√°n Horthy, the father of Mikl√≥s. It was a simple U shaped building and 1925 was reconstructed in neo-baroque style according to the plans of Franz Kalin. In 1944 it was looted by the Nazis who removed anything of value and burned the rest. Since then it has been used as a granary, horse stables, and an agricultural school. The exterior has been preserved as well as some of the rooms. Currently it serves as tourist accommodation and as rooms for students.

The company was formed in 1997 by Ralph Martin,Company History: Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. at Answers.com (accessed March 31, 2010) and is based in Montgomery, Alabama (after moving from Birmingham, Alabama in September 2011). The company is financed by, and is a subsidiary of, the Retirement Systems of Alabama.  History  The company has been formed by acquisitions. It started by acquiring many of the smaller former Park papers from Media General. Two years later, it bought several papers from Hollinger International. In 2000, it acquired another batch of papers from the Thomson Corporation. In 2002, CNHI paid $182 million for 4 daily newspapers and other non-daily publications from Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community newspaper group of Dow Jones & Co. Inc., that Ottaway had determined not to be growth markets. In 2006, the company acquired 6 more newspapers from Ottaway. Ottaway used $144 million of the 2002 sale to buy the Record newspaper in Stockton, California, in 2003. In September 2013, Dow Jones, which had renamed the properties as Dow Jones Local Media Group, sold the entire remaining group of 33 community newspapers to Newcastle Investment Corp. for a total of only $87 million. In 2007, CNHI sold the Santa Cruz Sentinel, a former Ottaway publication, to MediaNews Group. As of 2006, CNHI owned 90 daily newspapers and more than 200 non-daily newspapers in 22 states. George Wakefield is CNHI chairman; Donna Barrett is president and CEO. CNHI newspapers are clustered in groups that cross-sell packages to advertisers and occasionally feature shared editorial content. In 2009, CNHI implemented mandatory furloughs for most non- sales staff, requiring employees to take a mandatory week off without pay every quarter. As of 2015, these DOWOP (days off without pay) were still in effect. Also in 2014, most CNHI newspaper sites put a paywall into place, requiring readers to subscribe after reading 5 articles. On June 24, 2010, the company announced that it would relocate its headquarters and about 70 jobs to Montgomery, Alabama, into the RSA Dexter Tower Building when that building is complete in late 2011 or early 2012. Like its former headquarters in Birmingham, the new building is owned by Retirement Systems of Alabama, which is the principal source of investment funding for CNHI. David G. Bronner, CEO of the RSA, said the move will be good for the community and the company. The Montgomery Advertiser newspaper reported that Bronner was a key player in the move. With CNHI's Birmingham lease expiring, the decision to bring the company to Montgomery \\"was something that I strongly suggested,\\" he said, according to the newspaper. The city and Montgomery County offered $300,000 in incentives to pay moving costs for the company. In April 2012, along with GateHouse Media, Lee Enterprises and the E. W. Scripps Company, CNHI invested in Find n Save, an online company which offers local media an online shopping platform. On September 25, 2017, Raycom Media announced that it would merge with CNHI. Both companies are already principally owned by Retirement Systems of Alabama, and there were be administrative and content synergies between the properties. CNHI continued to operate as a subsidiary of Raycom. To comply with FCC newspaper cross-ownership restrictions, CNHI was to divest papers in the seven markets where Raycom also owns television stations. In January 2018, CNHI announced it would be moving to a regional editor system where a small number of editors would oversee coverage of regions and states. On June 25, 2018, Gray Television announced it would be acquiring Raycom's television assets. CNHI was not included in the sale to Gray and CNHI is currently seeking to sell off its newspapers, as a whole or piecemeal. With the completion of the purchase on January 2, 2019, the newspapers were re-organized to a direct subsidiary of RSA as Raycom ceased to exist.  CNHI newspapers  As can be inferred by its name, CNHI tends to acquire newspapers in smaller markets and suburbs of larger cities.

L.A. Style was most notable for their 1991 single \\"James Brown Is Dead\\", which appeared on Billboard's Hot 100 Airplay chart, becoming the first EDM group to venture near the top 50 of the main Billboard singles chart. Another famous song of L.A. Style was Balloony of 1992. Career The group was fronted by rapper/singer/songwriter & producer FX AKA Eazee F & The BFD (real name Frans Merkx). Wessel van Diepen was known for his skill in bringing a different sound to dance and mixing that with the talents of the lead artist FX. FX is considered as one of the first to set the trend of combining Euro pop with Rap in an effort to bring the masses the flavor of Rap music with a different twist. FX had numerous hits with Infobeat, most notable the single 'We got the Funk' and 'Are u Ready'. At the time L.A. Style followed up the huge success of International hit \\"James Brown Is Dead\\" with the smash hit 'I'm Raving'. L.A. Style appeared on 'MTV 'The Grind' and toured extensively all over North America, Asia & Europe with massive success. FX [also known as The Godfather of Techno] and Wessel van Diepen helped pushed the boundaries of dance music to another level where it was acceptable to mix Rap, Rock & Techno and for all genres and people from walks of life to come together. It was a bold statement but because of their groundbreaking styles L.A. Style set the trend for other super groups like 2 Unlimited and 2 brothers on the 4th floor to name but a few. They released a self-titled album as well as other singles, but despite massive success overseas as well as dance club play, L.A. Style's moment faded after the departure of the lead artist FX Frans Merkx and they quickly faded and dispersed in 1995. In recent years the group has again come to the attention of the pop world and rumors are that the group could be reformed with the original line up of FX as lead artist. There were also rumors that L.A. Style would be fronted by a totally new line up, however all agreed this would not go down well with the fans. Since the time of L.A.

Clay modelling is still preferable for any item needing detail and is always used for smaller and finer work.Film-set sculptor, By Annika Kristensen 20/12/10 creativeskillset.org, Sculptor Film sculptors * Keith Short * John Blakeley * Sam Demke References https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1548800/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 External links *wordpress.com, Production Team & Crew Glossary Category:Filmmaking occupations ","title":"Film sculptor"},{"id":"3939082","title":"Chief Justice of New Zealand"},{"id":"3939089","text":"Paul David Wiggin (born November 18, 1934) is a former American football player and coach who currently serves as the senior consultant for pro personnel with the Minnesota Vikings.

During the 1940s on thru the 1960s, DuSable enrollment was more than 4,000 which prompted two graduation ceremonies (spring and summer). During this period, DuSable became notable for its music program: Captain Walter Dyett was the longtime music instructor at the school.

The class were fitted with a variety of different boilers, most of which were not entirely satisfactory, and by 1914, four ships had been withdrawn. They had all been condemned in 1904 but were reprieved and remained in service, with scrapping proposed in 1915. History Pegasus was completed in 1898, and in 1899, she was stationed off the southeast coast of America. She was commissioned at Chatham on 21 May 1901 by Commander Edmund Hyde Smith, to serve at the Mediterranean Station. In June 1902 she was in Gibraltar for a coronation f√™te, and in September that year she visited the Aegean sea with other ships of the station for combined manoeuvres near Nauplia. She was later stationed at Australia, China, and finally Africa, serving on the Cape of Good Hope Station in 1906. In 1908, Pegasus rescued the crew of the wrecked French barque President F√©lix Faure, who had been stranded for sixty days on the Antipodes Islands. =First World War= Pegasus remained part of the Cape Station on the eve of the outbreak of the First World War. As the likelihood of war with Germany increased, the commander of the Cape Station, Rear Admiral Herbert King-Hall, deployed his ships in order to counter the threat posed by the German light cruiser , based at Dar es Salaam. On 31 July 1914, Pegasus sighted K√∂nigsberg leaving Dar es Salaam, but was unable to keep track of the faster German cruiser. King-Hall recognised that K√∂nigsberg outclassed Pegasus and intended that Pegasus should operate with the cruiser while his flagship operated independently to protect the trade routes around the Cape, but on 12 August, the Admiralty ordered Astraea to join Hyacinth off the Cape to escort troop convoys, leaving Pegasus unsupported at Zanzibar. On 23 August Pegasus sailed to the port of Bagamoyo in German East Africa with the intention of forcing a truce so that the port would take no further part in the war. When the port authorities refused to agree to such a truce, Pegasus shelled the port's Customs House. Sinking Lifebuoy from HMS Pegasus in Zanzibar Museum On 18 September 1914 Pegasus returned to Zanzibar harbour to carry out repairs to her engines. In the early morning of 20 September K√∂nigsberg launched a surprise attack on Pegasus. Pegasuss engines were shut down to allow the repairs, and outranged and outgunned, was incapacitated within eight minutes, and the captain ‚Äì Commander Ingles ‚Äì struck the colours to avoid further bloodshed. The ship sank later that day, with 31 lives lost and 55 wounded. The hospital ship Gascon and Scottish ship Clan Macrae came to the aid of the survivors. ‚ÄîPegasus sister ship‚Äîlater assisted in the blockade of the Rufiji River where K√∂nigsberg had taken refuge. Six of the eight guns were salvaged and two, named \\"Peggy III\\" and \\"Peggy IV\\", were used in the land campaign until 1916. Of the other four, two remained in Zanzibar, one was mounted on board the lake steamer Winifred, and the last mounted at Mombasa where it survives to this day outside Fort Jesus museum. Twenty-four of the British sailors who died in the battle were laid to rest in a mass grave in part of the naval cemetery on Grave Island, Zanzibar; the remaining 14 were buried in the town cemetery, but in 1971 were moved to the Dar es Salaam war cemetery.

It is usually placed at the mouth of irrigation channels to avoid water loss or at the end of drainage channels to elude water entrance.  Gate Valve  When using a gate, one thing that is used in certain applications such as manufacturing, mining, and others is the gate valve. Fluids will run through the valve to help lubricate the moving parts of a machine, transmit power, close off openings to moving parts, and to assist evaporating the amount of heat coming through. These fluids will flow throughout the gate valve with little resistance to flow and there is additionally small drops in pressure. Within the gate valve, there is a gatelike disk that moves up and down perpendicular to the path of flow and seats against two seat faces to shut off flow. = Best Uses = Gate valves are ideal for services that require little valve operation and where the disk is kept either opened or closed. For the usual type of gate valves that are out there today in industry, close regulation of these parts is recommended, however, it is impossible to do so. The Velocity of the fluid against a partly opened disk may cause vibration and chattering which will ultimately lead to damage to the seating surfaces and this is a common way that gate valves fail. = Type of Fluid = When using a gate valve, one must consider the type of fluid to use in the machine. Since gate valves are used in so many different types of machines that are used in so many different environments for different kinds of applications, it is highly recommended to use a fluid with a high viscosity index because it is a great multi-purpose fluid.

He was the author of Schuylkill County (Wampeter, 1982), The True Speed of Things (Slash and Burn, 1984), and fourteen other collections. More recently, he published River Architecture: Poems from Here & There 1973-1993 (Cynic, 1999), Loose Change (Marsh River Editions, 2001), and a volume in the Pudding House Greatest Hits series. Gerald Stern called his work ‚Äúheart-breaking‚Äù and ‚Äúnecessary,‚Äù while William Stafford has written, ‚ÄúLouis McKee makes me think of how much fun it was to put your hand out a car window and make the air carry you into quick adventures and curlicues. He is so adept at turning all kinds of sudden glimpses into good patterns.‚Äù Naomi Shihab Nye says, ‚ÄúLouis McKee is one of the truest hearts and voices in poetry we will ever be lucky to know.‚Äù 2006 Near Occasions of Sin, a collection issued in 2006 by Cynic Press, has been praised by Brendan Kennelly: ‚ÄúI really admire, and like, deeply, Louis McKee‚Äôs poems. They have two qualities I love ‚Äî clarity and candour. And they often tell stories even as they evoke mysteries of being. And they engage a great deal with people. ‚ÄúThe Soldier,‚Äù for example, is stunning for its pure drama. Then, he is a moving, complex love- poet, at once passionate and reserved. McKee's poems are like flashes of spirit rooted in the body. He never hides behind, or in, obscurity. Near Occasions of Sin is utterly unpretentious because his genius (I think he has that) is so real; ‚ÄúI am content with this,‚Äù he says at the end of ‚ÄúFailed Haiku‚Äù, and this readiness to be himself, in all his complexity and simplicity, is, I think, the basis of the appeal of this most unusual and attractive book. Sometimes, McKee talks to his reader and it is like talking to a next-door neighbor (that's what I mean by candour in these poems). Also, they sound like songs at times‚Äîwinged, humane, vulnerable.‚Äù Philip Dacey, writing about McKee‚Äôs poetry in Schuylkill Valley Journal (#24, spring, 2007) says, ‚ÄúIt is the essence of McKee‚Äôs work to be rich in artifice and craftsmanship and informed poetic strategies while at the same time consistently brave in its presentation of two confrontations: a person‚Äôs with himself and that person‚Äôs with the world outside himself. To read McKee is to witness drama and struggle; if the art is hard-won, the human victories are, too.‚Äù 2007 Warren Woessner, in the American Book Review (Jan/Feb 2007, Vol 28, No. 2), wrote that McKee's poems have a ‚Äúsurprising honesty‚Ä¶. In this era of superconfessional hubris, we are told that no topic is off-limits, but, if this is so, why are so many of these poems startling? Picasso said, ‚Äúart is not truth,‚Äù and I know that to be true, but it is important to the force of these poems that I can believe that the poet is giving us his stories straight up.‚Äù McKee was a longtime editor of the Painted Bride Quarterly. During his tenure, he edited three special issues, celebrating the work of Etheridge Knight and John Logan, as well as a retrospective, 20th-anniversary volume of the PBQ. He operated Banshee Press and edited the magazine One Trick Pony until its demise in 2007.

Background  In the United States, this diploma is usually awarded by hospital-based nursing schools. Students awarded a Diploma in Nursing are qualified to take the NCLEX-RN exam and apply for licensure as a Registered Nurse. At one time, all nurses in the United States were diploma- prepared. The Cherry Ames series of children's books was created to encourage girls to go into the nursing profession during World War II. She was a \\"hospital diploma\\" nurse. Although the number of hospital-based nursing schools continues to decrease, many still exist. Some require that non-nursing prerequisite courses be completed at another school prior to admission or coordinate their program with classes at a nearby school, though many are still self-contained. Nurses in other countries may also have diplomas, such as Practical Nurses in Canada, which complete a 2-3 diploma equivalent or greater in length to an associate degree in nursing completed the United States. In India, this type of diploma is awarded by hospital-based nursing schools as well as by the hospitals based on the 'Experience' of a person in this field. Also, in India, a Nursing degree/diploma is awarded by the Government Nursing Colleges affiliated to some of the Universities in India preferably Health Universities. In Maharashtra state of India, the Health University is situated at Nashik. All the Medical colleges in Maharashtra state of India are governed by this Health University. The syllabus for all the courses such as MBBS, BAMS, BHMS, BEMS, MD, MS etc.is decided by the Authorities of the University comprising the representatives in the field. Also, the schedule of the college terms, examinations (Theory/Practical/Orals/Submissions by the students/Laboratory records by the students, etc.) is decided by the University Authorities. The academic year of the medical colleges begins some time in October/November of every year. All graduation courses are of four-year duration (i.e. eight semesters). The first three years are of Two semesters whereas the last year is of three semesters. After the completion of the study course, the students have to undergo a year training course called \\"Internship\\" in the Government and Private hospitals.

He was the youngest of three brothers all active in the field ‚Äî his eldest brother William Norris founded the Norris Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Richard Norris took over the firm in about 1841. The other two brothers were primarily businessmen, while Septimus was an engineer. He worked for the Norris firm under William's management, but did not continue under Richard's; railway historian John H. White, Jr. believes animosity existed between Septimus and Richard. Septimus later worked for the Portland Company and the Schenectady Locomotive Works. He is frequently credited for the design of the first 4-6-0 locomotive, but in a paper written in 1885, George E. Sellers attributes the design to John Brandt, an engineer for the Erie Railway. White casts some doubt on Sellers' accuracy, and credits him in the development of coal-burning locomotives in the United States and as an early adopter of the more stable spread truck.

His French name was Jean de Grouchy, but he is more commonly known by his Latinized name. A Master of Arts, he is the author of the treatise Ars musicae (\\"The art of music\\") (c. 1300), an attempt to describe the music of his time as it was practiced in and around Paris. He divides music into three categories: *Musica simplex (popular music; music of the layperson) *Composita (according to metrical rules; music of the educated person) *Ecclesiastica (music of the Church) Grocheio departed from Boethius' taxonomy, which divided music between music of the world, human music, and instrumental music. A musician plays the vielle in a 14th-century medieval manuscript. Almost one-third of Grocheio's treatise is devoted to liturgical and composed music. The rest is devoted to secular music, and Grocheio surveyed its new social importance in a systematic and pedagogical fashion. Grocheio writes, for example, that \\"a good fiddler generally performs every kind of cantus and cantilena [cantil√®ne], and every musical form.\\" Grocheio was also one of the first scholars to define a motet. He believed that the motet was \\"not intended for the vulgar who do not understand its finer points and derive no pleasure from hearing it: it is meant for educated people and those who look for refinement in art.\\"  The purpose of music according to Grocheio's treatise  Grocheio attempted to address the sociological functions of specific musical forms and genres, and touted music as a cure for the ailments of society, imbuing it with the power to restrain social vices. He believed that when the elderly, the laborers, and the middle classes sang of the hardships endured by the heroes of the chansons de geste, it helped them to bear their miseries, thus contributing to the welfare of the state. Narrative epics, Grocheio concluded, contributed to the stability of the city because they encouraged citizens of all ages and stations to be satisfied with their lot in life. Conversely, Grocheio believed that trouv√®re songs inspired kings and noblemen to do great things and to be great: \\"This kind of song is customarily composed by kings and nobles and sung in the presence of kings and princes of the land so that it may move their minds to boldness and fortitude, magnanimity and liberality‚Ä¶\\"  Manuscripts  * Darmstadt, Hessische Landes- und Hochschulbibliothek, MS 2663, ff. 56-59. * London, British Library, Harley 281, ff. 30-52.

Originally strongly linked to the whaling industry, in later years it entered into more versatile shipbuilding, including rigs and modules for the offshore business. It was incorporated in 1898 and was closed down in 1986. History Framn√¶s mekaniske V√¶rksted A/S Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted has its origins from three earlier shipyards. Christen Christensen took over R√∏dsverven in 1868 and bought the other yards one by one. He started Sandefjord Flytedokker A/S in 1884. In 1892, he privately owned almost all of the properties that later became A/S Framn√¶s mek.V√¶rksted. In the meantime, he also bought Kamfjordverven and Stubbverven. In order to finance the conversion of the yards to steel shipbuilding, Christensen reorganized the corporate structure of the yard in 1898, to a shareholders' company. Sandefjord Flytedokker was dissolved and the two docks sold. New docks were then built by the yard. =1816-1861=Klavenessverven 1816-1861 In 1816, sheriff, farmer, yard owner and ship owner Thor Aagess√∏n Klavenes (1767‚Äì1854) established a site for keelhauling, and later a shipbuilding berth at Framnes. The keelhauling site was situated in the area where the carpentry shop was later built, with the building berth located to the northeast. In 1832, his son Aake Torss√∏n Klavenes took over the management of the yard until his death in 1853. Thor was the main creditor and reassumed control of the company, until Henrik Klaveness (the eldest son of Aake Klaveness) took over in 1857. He sold it to Joseph Lyhmann four years later. =1861-1892=Lyhmanns mek Verksted 1861-1882 The owner, businessman and ship owner Joseph Lyhmann (18 September 1825 ‚Äì 15 April 1915) built in 1861 Lyhmanns mek Verksted approximately where the A/S Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted engine shop were located, northwest of today's Skagerrak middle and high schools. Here, he started a machinery manufacturing business producing mainly agricultural machines such as threshing machines, chaff-cutters, plough equipment, and milling equipment, including Norway's first threshing machine. He also manufactured bicycles, which were claimed to be the first built in Norway. In addition, the business also made steamboats of steel. The company also produced steam engines, steam engines and equipment for sawmills, and boiling equipment for whaling. Sandefjord mek Verksted 1882-1892 In the autumn of 1882, Lyhmann sold the industry to the engineers Hetles√¶ter and Solberg. The enterprise was renamed Sandefjord mek. Verksted. After having done various mechanical activities, they also built many steamships made of steel, but they faced bankruptcy in 1886. Lyhmann, the industry‚Äôs main creditor, took back the facility and sold it in 1889 to Captain A.M. Aamundsen, the engineer Jacob Moe, and Adolf Top. They built and repaired steam ships, turbines, boilers, mills, and sawmill machines, and repaired sealing and other docked ships. The business did not fare well, and in 1892 it was sold to Christen Christensen. After Lyhmann sold the facility in 1882, he lived at \\"Birker√∏d\\" for some time. Here he had a small shop where he made grinding and polishing machines for knives. He kept poultry and bees, and made and sold honey separators. He also sold and bought ships. Lyhmann became a businessman in Oslo, where he manned the counter. Lyhmann married twice. He met his second wife through an advertisement in a newspaper. She was 14 years younger than his eldest daughter from his first marriage. They had four children; the youngest, his son Gaute, was born in 1907. Mr. Lyhmann was then 82 years old. =1826-1986=S√∏ebergverven 1826-1865 M√•nedsl√∏ytnant, timber merchant and shipowner Peder Soeberg (died 1863) came to Sandefjord in 1807 to join the coast guard. In the autumn of 1808, he conquered a Swedish and a British ship outside Vall√∏. He purchased one of these from the government and settled down in Sandefjord as a ship owner and businessman. In 1826, he started building ships at S√∏ebergverven which was located northeast of the former boiler shop at A/S Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted, with the building berth pointing northwest where the biggest floating dock used to be. The shipyard‚Äôs tug M/S David was the last ship launched from this building berth in 1930. In the same year that Peder S√∏eberg leased this site, he also bought Stubbverven. From the mid-1830s he entered into a cooperation with the sailmaker, businessman, yard owner, and ship owner S√∏ren Lorentz Christensen (9 April 1810 ‚Äì 5 May 1862), who from 1842 and onwards built a number of ships here. In 1850, S√∏ren Lorentz Christensen bought half of the S√∏ebergverven from S√∏eberg. S√∏ren Lorentz Christensen became relatively early a tired man, and died at the age of 52. R√∏dsverven 1865-1878 Christensen‚Äôs widow Otilie, (n√©e Kruge), was in charge of the management of the business for some years, and continued to do so until her son, yard owner, ship owner, and whaling manager Christen Christensen (9 September 1845 ‚Äì 16 November 1923), took over as manager in 1868. Later A/S Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted started numbering their new buildings from that date. New building no.1 was Sleipner, built by Christen Christensen for his mother Otilie. Framn√¶s Skipverft 1878-1892 Christen Christensen was a very enterprising man and bought all the surrounding shipyards and properties. When Christen Christensen moved from his private home in the town of Sandefjord (later, butcher Lauritz Pedersen's home) to Framn√¶sodden in 1879, he had become the sole owner of R√∏dsverven and the Langestrand area. He laid out an apple garden in the same area as the Framn√¶s mek Verksted later on had their shipbuilding berth. The house was later dismantled and moved to South Georgia as the administrator residence. Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted 1892-1898 Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted, 1892 In 1892, he also bought Lyhmanns mek Verksted or Sandefjord mek Verksted as the name was at that time, and renamed it Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted. He owned, at that time, practically all properties and facilities which Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted later owned. In the meantime he had, in 1894 , established Sandefjord Flytedokker A/S (Sandefjord Dry Docks A/S). They possessed two wooden floating docks, and had close ties with the yard in general. A/S Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted 1898-1986 A/S Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted, 1899 As it gradually became necessary to change from building ships of wood to ships of steel, and therefore to engage in costly investments, the shipyard in 1898 became a joint-stock company, namely A/S Framn√¶s mek. V√¶rksted. Christen Christensen remained its dominating shareholder, as his descendants have been since then. From 1899 to his death in 1923 he was chairman of the company. Director of the shipyard for 47 years was the engineer Ole Wegger (1859 - 1936). Christensen was also the founder, main shareholder and chairman of the world's largest seal-hunting company, A/S Oceana, established in Sandefjord in 1887 and registered in Sandefjord in 1891. Christen Christensen's biggest contribution was in the whaling business, as he started whaling in the Antarctic. Framn√¶s shipyard, 1930 =Properties= A/S Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksteds's landed property is mainly separated from a farm by the name of Vestre R√∏d. The eldest known name on the farm is Rud in Valley, and the first known owner was Svale Jonsson Sm√∏r. From 1620-30 the Vestre Rod belonged to the feudal overlord, Admiral Ove Gjedde, and was later included as a speck in his son-in-law, Niels Langes's big estate. When Niels Langes's bankruptcy was settled, Vestre Rod, in 1667, was first transferred to Mayor Marcus Barenholt‚Äôs property and then to Vilhelm Mechelsberg. In 1972, Vestre Rod was redeemed by Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenlove, and then it became county estate. The county estate was sold in 1805 to King Frederick VI of Denmark, who again sold it in 1817 to a shareholder company in Larvik, namely the gentlemen: county governor Michael Falk, dean J.F. Sartz, businessman Matthias Sartz and the cashier at Frits√∏ Jernverk, Gether (also called the badgers). In September 1835, they surrendered the properties to department counsel Villum Fredrik Treschow, who, on 11 September bought the claims of the county from King Frederick, who wanted to keep the wood and sell the farmland. In that way, sheriff Thor Aagess√∏n Klavenes on 4 January 1838 bought farm no.1 from Vestre Rod (the farm Vestre R√∏d was at that time split in two). Included was also a property he leased in 1816 for Klavenessverven, but not the part that Peder S√∏eberg leased in 1826 for S√∏ebergverven. Henrik Klaveness, the grandson of Thor Klaveness, took over this property by means of an auction convey of 21 February 1857 and sold it later, on 30 March 1861, to Joseph Lyhmann. In 1826, Peder S√∏eberg bought the Stubbverven from Jacob and S√∏ren Hauene, and he took on the lease to the Soebergverven the same year. This site Joseph Lymann bought from Michael Treschow on a convey of 9 December 1864. By a convey of 6 June 1865 Joseph Lyhmann sold the site to Henrik Klaveness. By a convey of 21 March 1874 Joseph Lyhmann and Henrik Klaveness sold the whole site of S√∏ebergverven to the businessman Jon Elis√¶us Sanne Wetlesen (father of art painter Wilhelm Wetlesen and brother-in-law of Christen Christensen). In the summer of 1872, Christen Christensen, shopkeeper P.C.Pedersen, shopkeeper G.Wier√∏d and Christen Lorentz S√∏rensen d.y. from Nordby built a steam sawmill at Svines by the lake Gogsjo. This came into the ownership of sheriff Bj√∏rndal and Ole and Anders Skorges in the summer of 1916. This was named Gogsj√∏ Dampsag. According to the convey, registered on 27 November 1874, J.E.S. Wetlesen did sell his part in the R√∏dsverven (S√∏ebergverven) to Gogsj√∏ Dampsag, who on 23 April 1878 transferred this site to Christen Christensen. On 31 October 1876 Christen Christensen bought from Joseph Lymann that part of Vestre R√∏d that reached from R√∏dsverven and out to Langestrandsbekken. By a convey dated 8 January 1892 Christen Christensen bought Sandefjord mek Verksted, formerly Lyhmanns mek Verksted, and later the same year also Stubbverven. Vestre R√∏d was already in the year of 1757 split into two farms. From 1821 to 1855 the farm no.2 was run by Hans Perss√∏n Holtan. In 1857 farm no.2 was sold to Martin Larsen Bettum {grandfather of Frithjof Bettum (ref.A.Jahres rederi)}. Christen Christensen bought in May 1878 from Martin Larsen a lot south of Langestrandsbekken and further out to the property of Gjelstad in south. Christen Christensen became the private owner of all the land A/S Framn√¶s mek V√¶rksted took over in the year of 1898.

He is known for his program \\"Odnako\\" () (Translated \\"However\\" or \\"Still\\"), irregularly appearing on air with commentaries on certain political occasions since March 1999. He is also a laureate of the \\"Golden pen of Russia\\" award and the TEFI award. Biography Leontyev graduated from the Department of General Economics of the Moscow Institute of National Economy in 1979, and worked in a scientific research institute up to 1985. Then he finished a college with profession \\"joiner-cabinetmaker\\", worked as unskilled labourer in Museum of Literature, was a guard at the cottage of Boris Pasternak, offered private lessons of history. Since 1989 he began working in journalism, was a correspondent of political department of magazine Kommersant, in 1990 headed economic department of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, was assistant editor-in-chief in newspaper Business –ú–ù. In 1993 he participated in creation of newspaper Segodnya and for some time worked as assistant editor-in-chief there. Worked on television since 1997, at first on channel TVC; in February 1999 he left TVC for Channel One. Besides Odnako, on Channel One Leontyev also made programs \\"Different Time\\" and \\"Puppet Theater with Leontyev\\", but they were closed by the channel. Leontyev also put together a project named \\"Bolshaya Igra\\" (The Great Game) with him in close-ups. It hit the air in October 2007, on the same channel . The short series of shows dealt with key historical episodes, chiefly mirroring the relation of the West and Russia, and taking the storyline to the present day to thus show the origins of the current issues concerning Russia and the western countries. Leontyev was awarded \\"Gold Pen of Russia\\" and nominated for TEFI-1997 (national television award). Since 2009 Leontyev is publisher and co-owner (along with Channel One) of weekly magazine with the same name Odnako. The magazine writers include: *Evgeny Dodolev *Aleksandr Dugin *Marina Lesko *Thierry Meyssan *Alexander Nevzorov Controversy Latvia declared Leontyev persona non grata after his sharp words about the country in 2003 interview on Riga television. In 2006, the Ukrainian government banned Leontyev from visiting the country for five years, referring to his \\"insulting statements\\" towards Ukraine (denying the existence of Ukrainian national identity). In 2007 Leontyev has launched Ukrainian business magazine Der Spiegel-Profil (as Editor in Chief). Publisher Evgeny Dodolev ended its one-year print run for magazine, due to economic difficulties (in 2008). Leontyev made several scandalous accusations both in his own show and in various interviews, for some of which he underwent trials. In 2001 he accused Viktor Yuschenko's wife, Kateryna Yushchenko-Chumachenko, of influencing her husband's political decisions with the U.S. ideas, hinting that she is an agent of American government in Ukraine. Mrs. Yushchenko has won two libel cases regarding the accusations in 2002 in Ukrainian city of Kiev, but the Russian government refuses to take legal actions against Leontyev as ruled out by the Ukrainian court.Gorobets, Aleksandr (30 January 2002) –ê–õ–ï–ö–°–ê–ù–î–† –ì–û–†–û–ë–ï–¶: –í–ï–î–£–©–ò–ô –û–†–¢ –ú. –õ–ï–û–ù–¢–¨–ï–í –ü–†–û–ò–ì–†–ê–õ –°–£–î –ñ–ï–ù–ï –í–ò–ö–¢–û–†–ê –Æ–©–ï–ù–ö–û ‚Äî –ï–ö–ê–¢–ï–†–ò–ù–ï –ß–£–ú–ê–ß–ï–ù–ö–û. –ü–†–ê–í–î–ê, –í –ö–ò–ï–í–ï. pravda.ru In November 2014, Leontyev wrote an article for Channel One Russia, which presented an aerial photo claiming to show a jet fighter firing a missile at Malaysian Airlines Flight 17. This refuted the view, widely held in the West, that MH17 had been shot down by a BUK missile fired by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The photo in Leontyev's article was analysed by contributors to the Bellingcat site, who found it had been artificially constructed with photo manipulation software, and was not a genuine image of the incident.

On most stations, the local news operation is branded with standard, regional titles such as CBC Toronto News. However, there are variations to this naming convention for northern Canada and certain markets where CBC has historically been strong in local news (such as Here & Now in Newfoundland, Compass in Prince Edward Island, and Northbeat on CBC North) Overview Currently, most CBC O&Os; produce either a full- hour or a 30-minute local newscast during the early evening on weeknights. In addition, most stations air a late-night newscast for ten or thirty minutes at 11 p.m. following The National. This schedule varies for some stations depending on available resources or local considerations. CBET-DT Windsor previously aired its 90-minute evening newscast at 5:30 p.m. until the revamping of CBC's local news operations in October 2015 (it now airs for 30 minutes beginning at 5:59 p.m.), while CBNT-DT St. John's formerly aired CBC News: Here & Now - Early Edition at 5:30 p.m. Newfoundland Time until October 2015, followed by the hour-long CBC News: Here & Now at 6:00 p.m. NT. Local evening newscasts are produced in all three Maritime provinces, but a single late-night newscast for the region is produced at CBHT-DT Halifax. Likewise, the Alberta stations in Calgary and Edmonton produce their own evening newscasts, but a single late-night provincial newscast is produced in Edmonton at CBXT-DT. Due to unique circumstances and needs in Northern Canada, two local television newscasts are aired by CBC North in that region. The 30 minute-long CBC News: Northbeat (5:00 p.m. CT / 6:00 p.m. ET) features local news in English and several Aboriginal languages (translated with English subtitles). This is followed by a 30-minute newscast in Inuktitut, Igalaaq (·êÉ·íê·ìõ·ñÖ, \\"Window\\"). CBC North does not carry a late-night newscast of its own, and simulcasts CBC Edmonton News instead. Until 2011, CBUT-DT Vancouver was the only CBC O&O; to produce weekend newscasts, with half-hour programs on Saturday nights at 10:30 p.m. (after Hockey Night in Canada) and Sundays at 11:00 p.m. On October 15, 2011, CBLT added a half-hour 6 p.m. newscast on Saturdays, and a ten-minute news bulletin on Sundays at 10:55 p.m.;CBC Toronto Launches Expanded Weekend News Service , Broadcaster Magazine, October 14, 2011. CBRT-DT Calgary would also join CBUT and CBLT in carrying weekend local news programming during the fall of 2011, and CBNT-DT St. John's launched a local weekend newscast in the spring of 2012, as part of a five-year strategy by the CBC to improve its services to six million Canadian homes unserved or underserved by CBC's radio, television and internet services.CBC Launches Initiative to Improve Service As Part of Strategic Plan , Broadcaster Magazine, May 26, 2011.CBC expands local news service, CBC News, September 26, 2011. On September 2, 2013, CBET Windsor expanded its early evening newscast to 90 minutes from 5:30 to 7 p.m., while its 11 p.m. newscast was replaced by CBLT's newscast at that time, differing from most CBC O&Os; in other markets where the station carries both an early and late evening newscast of its own.CBC Windsor to expand evening news, The Windsor Star, June 25, 2013. Asha Tomlinson became anchor of the expanded newscast, replacing Amanda Ferguson, who became anchor during Susan Pedler's maternity leave.CBC Program Guide: Asha Tomlinson History Prior to fall 2000, CBC stations produced local newscasts under a variety of titles, including Broadcast One at CBUT, 24 Hours at CBWT Winnipeg, CBC Evening News at CBLT Toronto, Compass at CBCT Charlottetown, and Here & Now at CBNT. These were typically one-hour broadcasts aired at 6:00 p.m. local, 6:30 p.m. NT. 30-minute late local newscasts, in many cases titled Newsfinal, were also aired in most markets at 11:30 p.m. local / midnight NT. The late newscasts were abandoned briefly during the Prime Time News era, resumed in the mid-1990s, and cancelled again in 2000. In early 2000, the CBC (under president Robert Rabinovitch) announced a plan to eliminate local newscasts except in Northern Canada, believing that the dominance of private competitors had made these programs redundant. Local newscasts were to be replaced by a national supper-hour program with limited local inserts.CBC to drop local news, cut 500 jobs, Chris Cobb, Ottawa Citizen, April 16, 2000. Accessed online June 22, 2010 (via Friends of Canadian Broadcasting). This plan, and particularly the fact that exceptions would not be made for the CBC's highly rated newscasts in Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island, led to protests across the country, and most strongly in those two markets. As a compromise, CBC News introduced Canada Now as a replacement for its 6:00 p.m. newscasts outside of the north, which consisted of a half-hour national newscast hosted by Ian Hanomansing in Vancouver, followed by a half-hour local newscast. While the PEI newscast remained relatively strong (as the only newscast produced on the island), ratings dropped across the board, most dramatically in Newfoundland where CBNT's local news ratings decreased by more than 50% between 2000 and 2004.How CBC gave away its supper-hour audience , Vannessa Gaudet, King's Journalism Review, November 24, 2006. Accessed online June 22, 2010. By 2005, the CBC had decided to rethink this strategy and began to expand local news again at certain stations, beginning with CBNT, where an hour-long Here & Now newscast resumed on November 7. In most other markets, local news returned to the 6:00 p.m. time slot in early 2006, mainly under the banner CBC News at Six, although these remained as 30-minute newscasts. (Canada Now was retained as a separate 30-minute national newscast at 6:30 p.m., as well as the title of the integrated local/national newscast aired within British Columbia.) Montreal's anchor, Dennis Trudeau retired shortly before the launch of CBC News at Six, having hosted the local bulletins for many years. On November 10, 2006, it was revealed that Janet Stewart would host CBC Winnipeg's edition of News at Six starting in January 2007. Stewart was a popular anchor at top-rated rival CKY- TV and her move to News at Six surprised many in the local media.CKY's Stewart moving to CBC. Winnipeg Sun. 11 Nov 2006. Retrieved 12 Nov 2006. On November 30, 2006 it was announced that as part of its focus on reinvigorating local news, CBC News at Six would expand to a full hour in February 2007,CBC to restore one-hour local news shows, cancel Canada Now, CBC News, December 4, 2006. Accessed online June 22, 2010. signalling the end of the national Canada Now program (although that title was temporarily retained for CBUT's local newscast). During summer 2007, CBC News' Vancouver operation became a test- site for an experimental newscast bringing together staff from local CBC radio, television and online services to create an interactive local newscast that employs a concept called \\"civic journalism\\". If successful, the format was then to be gradually be applied to CBC News at Six programs across the country over a three-year period. Former Canada Now anchor Ian Hanomansing was reassigned to co-host the new Vancouver program on CBUT, alongside Gloria Macarenko (he has since been reassigned to The National as reporter and substitute anchor, replaced in Vancouver by veteran anchor Tony Parsons). In September 2009, CBC expanded its local news programs again to 90 minutes, running from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. local time on most stations, with exceptions as noted above (this allowed CBC to carry Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! in the 7:00 p.m. hourwith the corresponding simsub privileges in many markets preceded by Coronation Street, which formerly occupied the 7:00 p.m. time slot, at 6:30 p.m.). This was followed on October 26, 2009 by the return of late local news on most CBC stations with a ten-minute bulletin following The National. Until that date, only CBUT carried a brief 11 p.m. post-National local newscast. On September 17, 2012, CBC's late local newscasts were expanded to a full half-hour in major markets, including Calgary, Edmonton, the Maritimes, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver. The majority of CBC stations now also air local or regional newscasts at weekends. In December 2014, CBC announced changes to its local news operations that took effect as of the 2015-16 television season. 90-minute evening newscasts were cut down to 60 or 30 minutes, with Charlottetown, Halifax, St. John's, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg cut down to an hour-long newscast, and Calgary, Edmonton, Fredericton, Montreal, Regina, and Windsor cut down to a single half-hour. On CBC North, Northbeat and Inuktitut-language Igalaaq each air for half an hour. The stations also began to air local, top-of-hour news updates during the afternoons and primetime, and, except on CBC North, air simulcasts of local CBC Radio One morning shows at 6:00 a.m. local time. The change came as part of a shift towards digital and mobile platforms for news output, along with a desire to build \\"a comprehensive, four-platform local news service ‚Äî across the day and on demand\\" with less emphasis on evening newscasts. On March 18, 2020, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the CBC suspended all local newscasts and replaced them with simulcasts of CBC News Network. The CBC stated in an employee memo that a lack of staff at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre (as of 2019, production control room operations for local newscasts were centralized at the Toronto-based facility) and \\"much stricter newsgathering protocols\\" were a factor, and publicized that this was done in order to pool all local resources towards CBC News Network as a \\"core news offering\\" for rolling coverage (which included CBC's local anchors appearing throughout the day). This once again excluded CBC North, which continued to air Northbeat and Igalaaq. Some of the CBC regions continued to produce short news segments on digital platforms. The decision faced criticism for reducing the amount of local coverage of the pandemic's impact‚Äîespecially in markets (such as PEI, prompting complaints from Premier Dennis King) where the CBC is the only local source of news programming. On March 24, the CBC announced that it would begin to reinstate its local newscasts, including \\"an expanded 30-minute local news segment on CBC News Network\\" beginning March 25, and a goal to \\"make every effort to have all of the dedicated local shows back up on the main network\\". Program details Times for the majority of CBC regional news programs are 5:59 p.m. - 6:30 p.m. or 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. - 11:10 p.m. or 11:30 p.m., and titles follow the standard naming conventions described above, unless otherwise specified.

His father Joshua served in the first Wisconsin Constitutional Convention of 1846 and in the Illinois House of Representatives.'History of the Great Northwest and Its Men of Progress,' Hugh J. McGrath, Minneapolis Tribune: 1901, Biographical Sketch of Frank White, pg. 500-502 Education and career White received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Illinois in 1880. Soon after graduation, White worked for the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad. In 1882, he moved to the Dakota Territory, although his reasons for doing so are unclear. According to the book Barnes County History, White departed for North Dakota at his father's request to look after land he had acquired near Valley City; Clement Lounsberry‚Äôs North Dakota History and People reports that White moved to North Dakota to look after land he himself had purchased. Nevertheless, while White was in Valley City he met Elsie Hadley, a native of Indiana who was a math teacher at Valley City State Normal School. The couple were married on September 19, 1894, in Indianapolis. The couple had one son, Edwin Lee White who was born in Valley City, North Dakota, on July 5, 1896. Political career White's interests soon turned toward politics, and in 1890 he was elected to represent District 15 in the North Dakota House of Representatives. He served only one term before being elected to the North Dakota State Senate in 1892. He was re-elected in 1896, but resigned from this post to become a commissioned major of the First North Dakota Volunteer Infantry, Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. White arrived in the Philippines on July 30, 1898, participating in the capture of Manila on August 13. Throughout his service in the war, White participated in over twenty engagements, was a highly respected leader, and was awarded the Silver Star for bravery during combat. White returned to the United States in 1899, and purchased land near Litchville, North Dakota. In 1900, he opened a real estate and insurance office. That same year, he received the Republican nomination for Governor, and was victorious in the fall election. He was reelected in 1902, and under White's two-term governorship, many needed reforms were implemented. A large amount of the school funds were not drawing interest, and White decided to invest the money in bonds and farm loans, earning interest in the lump sum. It was during his administration that North Dakota's first state bonds were redeemed. In fact, through his sound financial maneuvering, a $223,000 state deficit was eliminated. In January 1905, however, White decided to retire from political office to return to private business. He organized the Middlewest Fire Insurance Company and served as its president until 1913, when the company merged with Twin City Fire Insurance Company. In 1914, White organized the Middlewest Loan & Trust Company and was its president until America's entry into World War I. World War I With the advent of World War I, White was commissioned once more, this time at the rank of colonel. He commanded the Second North Dakota National Guard Regiment, which later merged into the 41st Infantry Division. In 1918, he was sent to France, but due to his age he was not assigned to combat duty.  Treasurer of the United States  When the war ended, White returned to take up his position in Middlewest Loan & Trust Company. His career in politics was not finished, though, for in 1921 White was named United States Treasurer at the request of President Warren G. Harding. When Calvin Coolidge became President in 1924, he was asked to remain in the position. Having served in the position of US Treasurer from 1921, he resigned in May 1928 to become president of Southern Mortgage Guaranty Corporation at Chattanooga, Tennessee. He also implemented smaller dollar bills while in office. Death Elsie White died in 1925. Colonel Frank White died in Washington, D.C. on March 23, 1940. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia, with full military honors.

It is located at around . The town has an outer suburb, Tapolca-Diszel, approximately 5 km to the East.  Etymology  The origin of Tapolca is disputed, originating either from the Hungarian Tapolcza, meaning \\"high place\\", due to the city's position on a small hill, or from the Slavic Toplica/Teplica meaning \\"hot springs\\". It was also known as Turul or Turultapolca at some points in the Middle Ages.  Notable sights = The Lake Cave = This 3 km long lake cave system is situated in the heart of the town. It was opened to the public in 1912, ten years after its discovery. Small boats can be hired to explore the cave system. At 15‚Äì20 m below the town, a 5 km long cave system criss-crosses the Miocene limestone layers. This includes the 3.3 km long Lake Cave, which is mostly filled with karst water. The cave was discovered in 1903 during well digging. Thanks to these explorations, round boat trips were made possible from 1937. Because of its special origin and unique formations, it was designated a protected area in 1942 and placed under strict protection in 1982. The mixture of the cold karst water flowing there and the thermal water up-surging from the deep dissolves limestone. Initially narrow passages, then smaller and larger niches were formed. Over a very long period, these widened into spacious chambers and passages. Dripstones have not developed in the cave, as several metre thick clay deposits prevents infiltration from the surface. Only calcareous formations (cave corals and aragonite crystals) occur at some places, having precipitated from the cave air. Bats cannot enter the closed spaces, so the largest vertebrate is a 10 cm long fish, the Common minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus L.), which probably swims in through the wet passages from the Malom-t√≥ (Mill Pond). The cave air, with nearly 100% humidity, a high calcium content and a constant temperature of 20 ¬∞C, is used to cure respiratory diseases in the branches under the town hospital that are in close proximity with the cave. The radon content of the cave air is too low to have any effect on the visitors.Information board, entrance of the Cave Lake, Tapolca, Hungary = Mill Pond = A romantic part of the town is the Mill Pond (Malom-t√≥). The Upper Pond can be reached from the Main Square through a small backyard where the \\"Four Seasons\\", a sculpture by L√°szl√≥ Marton, is situated. = Garden of Ruins = The Church Hill is the medieval centre of Tapolca. The church was built in the 13th century in Roman style, during the 14th century it was finished as Gothic church. After the Ottoman invasion, it was rebuilt in Baroque style in 1756. = School Museum = The School Museum is located in the former cantor house. The greatest pedagogic collection of the Transdanubian region can be found there. = Main Square = The former marketplace of the town, the Main Square, functioned as a trade centre from ancient times. The statue of Holy Trinity was erected in the middle of the square in 1757. Another masterpiece, the Little Princess, is located there too.

The park consists of two areas: Izmaylovsky forest and Izmaylovsky Park for recreation. It is situated in the Izmaylovo District in the northeast of the city. The northern border of the park is the tram line alongside the Izmailovskaya station of the Moscow Metro that serves the park, the southern is the Entuziastov Highway. To the east the park is limited by the main alley and to the west by and 1st and 2nd streets of the Izmaylovo menagerie. History of the park In 1571-1585 the park was a country estate of a Muscovite boyar Zakharyin-Yuriev. After 1585, the ownership was passed to the Romanov family. Since 1663, it became the official countryside residence of tsar Aleksey Mikhailovich. The very same time the construction and redesign of the estate were initiated. At first, a dam was constructed on Serebryanka river which resulted in formation of several ponds, namely Lebedyansky, Vinogradny and Serebryany. An artificial island was situated in the middle of the Serebryany pond. Later, the official tsar‚Äôs palace was built on that island that existed up until 1855. Christmas church was also built on the Serebryany Island in 1676, which became the cathedral in 1679. There were a lot of gardens with exotic plants and trees, cherished under personal supervision of the tsar. The household buildings also included greenhouses, mills, breweries and other facilities. The organization of the household was so efficient that it alone could fully satisfy the needs of the tsar‚Äôs court. One of the biggest zoos in Europe at that time could also be found in Izmaylovo manor.Century old trees of the Izmaylovsky park Unfortunately, after the death of Aleksey Mikhailovich the estates were abandoned and a lot of the buildings and facilities fell into decline. When he was a child, Peter the Great used the territory and the gardens for his war games; the remains of the redoubts he built are still partially preserved. He also constructed a Prosyansky (Zhukovski) dam on the Serebryanka river to form a pond, which was later used for the trial sails of the botik ‚ÄúSt. Nicholas‚Äù that Peter the Great discovered in Izmaylovo. In 1839, the mansion was used as a hospice and a house for the veterans of the war with Napoleon, as well as a shelter for the windows and a small school for their children. In 19th century a big effort was put into recovery and restoration of the forests and gardens on the territory of the future Izmaylovsky park that continued over the decades. In 1930, Izmaylovo was given an official status of the park and in 1939 it was renamed after J.V. Stalin. It was one of the best parks in USSR, with a lot of facilities, including a theatre and a cinema. The park‚Äôs giant territory allowed for more objects to be installed, thus a pond was to be created in the middle of the park, and a zoo in the eastern part of it. A giant central stadium also named after Stalin was supposed to be the highlight of the park infrastructure and the biggest stadium in the country. The construction, although started, was haltered by the Second World War and never finished. In 1944, an underground station ‚ÄúIzmaylovsky park‚Äù was built to allow good transportation links with the other parts of the city. In 1961 the park was renamed to Izmaylovsky park, falling in line with the general direction of the party against Stalin's cult of personality. The underground station was renamed in 2005 into Partizanskaya. Available activities *Bavarian curling *Shuffleboard * two Ferris wheels *children's playground *amusement park and rides *5D cinema *swimming pool *dolphinarium *adventure park\\"PandaPark\\" *equipment hiring *skaters area *boat hiring Also, throughout the year free outdoor classes and courses are free to the public, including general work-out, yoga, dancing and aerobics for children. For children, there is also a small zoo with rabbits, rats, hedgehogs and Guinea pigs. In winter a skating rink is open. Izmaylovsky forest Izmaylovsky forest has a territory of 1608.1 hectares. The forest has a big diversity of plant species, including those that are endangered and are monitored by the Preservation agencies (almost 50 species). Rarely observed in urban areas, the transitional bog of the forest has originated from growing of the sphagnum moss. There are more than 25 species of lichens and 75 species of moss. The major part of the forest consists of deciduous trees, such as linden tree, oak, birch, maple. The Eastern part of the forest is constituted mainly by pines and firs that are more than hundred years old and were planted in the middle of 19th century as a part of the forest restoration effort. In total, more than 500 species are presented within the biological diversity of the forest. Some flowering plants are also preserved: various species of lilies, including Turk's cap lily, orchids, etc. Many species are registered medicinal plants and are listed in the Russian Pharmacopoeia (The State Pharmacopoeia of the Russian Federation), such as bistort Bistorta officinalis. Interesting facts *In November 1995, Chechen terrorists planted, but did not detonate, a radiological dispersal device (commonly known as a dirty bomb) in Izmailovo Park.http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/PressReleases/2002/prn0209.shtml The bomb consisted of dynamite and caesium-137 removed from cancer treatment equipment. Reporters were tipped off about its location and it was defused. *There is also a stand-up comedy show in Russian television with the same name (Izmaylovsky Park), starring Russian comedian Lion Izmailov. The name is based on a word play, where Izmaylovsky belongs both to the park (where people get together for recreation) and to the surname of the show host.

In addition to appearing in the saga's movies and TV series, several LucasArts games depict the player as a starfighter pilot. A-wing The Kuat RZ-1 A-wing Interceptor is a class of starfighter, depicted as fast but fragile interceptors of the Rebel Alliance, conceived for high-speed surgical strikes, deep reconnaissance and escort fighter duty. A-wings first appear in Return of the Jedi (1983) during the climactic Battle of Endor. It gained popularity through its depiction in several video games, such as Battlefront II and 2015 Battlefront, and has been merchandised by several companies. ARC-170 The ARC-170 starfighter or Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter were flown by clone pilots of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. They first appear in the opening battle sequence of Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith (2005) and have featured in the 2008 Clone Wars television series. The fighter's name stems from \\"ART 170\\", the file name of the art that established the ship's appearance; during scripting it was simply referred to as the \\"Clone Fighter.\\" According to background material, the ARC-170 was a favorite for clone pilots attacking Separatist capital ships, being well-armed with wingtip heavy laser cannons, proton torpedo launchers, and rear-facing laser cannons. It had a crew of three: a pilot, a co-pilot who handled the forward- facing weapons, and a tail gunner. An astromech droid would make minor repairs and manage the starfighter's hyperdrive, which allowed it to travel faster- than-light. Incom Corporation built the ARC-170 starfighter, and would use the design as inspiration for the X-wing. Like the X-wing, the ARC-170 featured S-foils, which were opened during combat to shed waste heat, enlarge the starfigther's deflector shield, and function as stabilizer surfaces during atmospheric flight. B-wing The A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter is a fictional Rebel Alliance and New Republic starfighter. They first appear in Return of the Jedi (1983) and subsequently in the Star Wars expanded universe's books, comics, and games. A variety of B-wing merchandise has been released by toy companies. ;Origin and design Although initial plans called for B-wings to appear in several scenes, its narrow appearance from some angles made it difficult to see against the backdrop of space. The ship's rotating cockpit stems from an initial design for the Millennium Falcon. ;Depiction The B-wing's canonical origin (as the Blade Wing), as-designed by the Mon Calamari engineer Quarrie, is depicted in the Star Wars Rebels, second season episode \\"Wings of the Master\\". Quarrie designed the Blade Wing to be a blockade buster for the Rebel Alliance, combining aspects of previous ships built by the Verpine Slayne & Korpil corporation including the V-19 Torrent starfighter, H-60 Tempest bomber and T-6 shuttle. While Quarrie's Blade Wing helped the crew of the Ghost escape an Imperial blockade, the prototype was plagued with a number of technical challenges. Senator Bail Organa was responsible for convincing Slayne & Korpil to work with Quarrie to fix these issues and create a production model, the A/SF-01, for the Rebel Alliance. Expanded universe material states the A/SF-01 was the most well-armed starfighter in the Star Wars galaxy at the time it was introduced; a single B-wing was capable of attacking and destroying enemy capital ships. However it was also slower and less maneuverable than any other Rebel starfighter and required the most maintenance. The B-wing's gyrostabilized cockpit allowed the pilot to maintain a consistent horizon while the craft's body rotated around it, minimizing g-stresses on the pilot and letting them concentrate on flying and targeting. However, if the gyro-stabilization system was not kept in prime condition, it could fail under the tremendous pressure and lock up. The B-wing featured S-foils similar in function to those of the X-wing fighter. ;Merchandise Both Kenner and Hasbro released B-wing toys, the B-wing is part of two Micro Machines three-packs, and Lego has made several B-wing sets. A Micro Machines Alpha Fleet package includes models both of the B-wing's film appearance and of an initial production design. Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published B-wing cards for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Trading Card Game, respectively. The second expansion pack for the X-Wing flight simulator, B-Wing, introduces the B-wing as a playable starfighter; several other LucasArts products also depict B-wings. Droid Tri-Fighter A pair of Droid Tri-Fighters during the Battle of Coruscant Droid Tri-fighters are droid starfighters used by Separatist forces during the Clone Wars. They made their first theatrical appearance in the opening battle of Revenge of the Sith (2003). Original plans to equip the fighters with boosters were abandoned when Lucas decided they were an unnecessary distraction in the already chaotic scene. Its curved braces are deliberately reminiscent of the Trade Federation's circular battleship. Droid Tri-fighters are compact and heavily armed starfighters with three arms surrounding a rotating gyroscopic core. Four laser cannons, one on each arm and one centrally located on the fighter, can be supplemented with a variety of missile weapons, including proton torpedoes, concussion missiles and buzz droids. E-wing An improved successor to the X-wing, the E-wing first appeared in Dark Horse Comics' Dark Empire series. They are one of few Expanded Universe vehicles to be a part of Micro Machines' Action Fleet line. Armed with three Taim & Bak IX9 Medium Laser Cannons and two proton torpedo launchers, the E-wing's aerodynamic frame made the fighter highly maneuverable and exceptional in atmospheric flight. Its Class 1 Hyperdrive allowed for extended reconnaissance missions and rapid strategic redeployment. As part of a larger force, the E-wing filled a versatile mid-range multirole combat aircraft or light torpedo bomber. Gauntlet Fighter A Gauntlet Fighter, or Kom'rk-class fighter, is a Mandalorian class of ship. Larger than most starfighters, it can carry a larger crew and accommodate passengers. They were introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars being used by the Mandalorian splinter group Deathwatch. Another one known as the Nightbrother later served as Darth Maul's personal craft in Star Wars Rebels. Kom'rk-class fighter/transports are equipped with four laser cannons, a Class 1 hyperdrive, and space to carry up to 24 soldiers. Two versions of the starfighter model exist, one long and a smaller variant long.Barr, et. al. (2019), p. 324Landry (2018), p. 102 Geonosian starfighter Two Geonosian starfighters in the First Battle of Geonosis. Geonosian Starfighters appear in the climactic Battle of Geonosis in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones when they chase after a Republic attack gunship carrying Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Padm√© Amidala (Natalie Portman). The craft was also set to appear in an air battle during which Republic attack gunships attack a Geonosian airstrip but the scenes were ultimately cut. The starfighter technically made its first appearance in the video game Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter which was released prior to the movie.Walker (2019), p. 90 Within the Star Wars universe these craft were considered nimble fighters, working equally well in space or in an atmosphere, and afforded the pilot a 360¬∞ field of view. Fanblade starfighter Asajj Ventress flies the fanblade in the animated Star Wars: Clone Wars series. Just as Ventress' appearance was inspired by a Samurai stance, the ship itself has Asian influences: its design is based on a sensu folding fan. Background literature refers to these as Ginivex-class fanblade starfighters, with only six built for Asajj's personal use. long, the starfighters' retractable solar sail helps make the ship extremely fast with a powerful deflector shield but also makes it easier to spot. It is also equipped with a Class 1 hyperdrive and a rotating laser cannon mounted on either end of the solar sail.Landry (2018), p. 93 Jedi starfighter The Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptors (better known as \\"Jedi starfighters\\") appear in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2003), when Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) travels via Jedi starfighter to Kamino to investigate the attempted assassination of Padm√© Amidala (Natalie Portman); he also flies a Jedi starfighter to Geonosis in an attempt to track down the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison). Later, Plo Koon (Matt Sloan) flies a Jedi starfighter when he is shot down by clone troopers carrying out Emperor Palpatine's (Ian McDiarmid) Order 66 in Revenge of the Sith (2005). In the 2003 Clone Wars animated series, Anakin Skywalker is seen flying a customized Delta-7, called the Azure Angel, of which a Lego model was later made.Becraft, A., Malloy, C. (2017). Ultimate LEGO Star Wars. United States: DK Publishing. p. 303 The Jedi starfighter's triangular shape stems from the shape of Imperial Star Destroyers in the original Star Wars trilogy. Industrial Light & Magic designer Doug Chiang identified the Jedi starfighter as one of the first designs that bridges the aesthetic between the prequel and original trilogies. Chiang noted that viewers' familiarity with the Star Destroyer's appearance and Imperial affiliation gives added symbolism to the Jedi craft's appearance and foreshadows the Empire's rise to power. A full- scale model of the starfighter was also created for filming purposes. During scenes taking place on the rain-swept landing pads of Kamino, the model had to be painted and specially prepared in order to resist any water damage.Walker (2019), p. 86 Star Wars expanded material states that the Delta-7 was designed specifically with the Jedi's Force-aided reflexes in mind by stripping them down and making their controls as responsive as possible. Lacking an internal hyperdrive, the Jedi starfighter used an external hyperspace transport wing to which it could attach for faster-than-light travel. Its two Novaldex J-44 \\"Jetforce\\" sublight engines were equipped with electromagnetic thrust nozzles that focused and timed engine bursts to match the Jedi's abilities. This also made the starfighter overwhelmingly difficult for a non-Jedi to pilot. When the Jedi were destroyed after Order 66, the Delta-7's manufacturer, Kuat Systems Engineering, designed a new starfighter that would be more manageable for non-Jedi to pilot, creating the A-wing. Jedi interceptor The Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptors, also known as \\"Jedi interceptors\\", made their first theatrical in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In the opening space battle, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) pilot Jedi interceptors on a mission to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from General Grievous. The craft's design was purposefully meant to echo the earlier Jedi starfighter and the TIE Fighter, while its opening wing panels were influenced by a feature on Hasbro's toy model of the Jedi starfighter. For filming close-ups of the actors, a single full-scale model of the Jedi interceptor was created. Since Obi-wan and Anakin's interceptors were individualized with their own color schemes, each actor would perform their scenes separately and switch out, allowing the model to be redressed in between.Walker (2019), p. 96 In-universe material states that this new starfighter was meant to expand the Jedi's arsenal as they found themselves on the front lines of the Clone Wars, being smaller but possessing greater firepower than the earlier Delta-7 with both laser and ion cannons. The Eta-2 had no deflector shields or bulky flight controls in order to save weight and maximize speed and agility, instead relying on the Jedi's Force abilities to compensate. After the Jedi were destroyed during Order 66, the Eta-2 would serve as the inspiration for the Galactic Empire's TIE Fighter. Naboo N-1 starfighter The Naboo N-1 Starfighter made its theatrical appearance in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. During the climatic Battle of Naboo, a squadron of the fighters attacked the orbiting Trade Federation Droid Control Ship Saak'ak. Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) accidentally steals a Naboo N-1 starfighter and pilots it into the Droid Control Ship's docking bay, destroying the vessel from the inside. N-1 Starfighters also appear in the beginning of Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones escorting senator Padm√© Amidala's (Natalie Portman) Naboo Royal Cruiser upon its arrival to Coruscant. The N-1 also appears at the end of the edited and remastered 2004 \\"Special Edition\\" DVD version of Return of the Jedi. The fighter technically first appeared as an unlockable vehicle in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, which was released approximately six months before The Phantom Menace, and was available as a playable vehicle in the video games Star Wars: Battle for Naboo and Star Wars: Starfighter. The N-1 initially had the same angular design as craft in the original Star Wars trilogy; only in later designs did it take on a streamlined appearance. A life-size model of a Naboo Starfighter hangs suspended from the ceiling of the Blue Wing at the Boston Museum of Science, in Boston, Massachusetts. This 1:1 scale model was unveiled at the museum in April 2004, as a prelude to the Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination exhibit. The model was previously used as a prop during the filming of The Phantom Menace. Based on in-universe background material, the N-1's sleek design exemplified the philosophy of art and function in Naboo technology. It was armed with two laser cannons, two proton torpedo launchers, and a capable automatic pilot feature. The starfighter's front was clad in chromium for decorative purposes, but its sleek shape was equal parts artistic expression and aerodynamic function. Its long tail served as a high-voltage charge collector, while the engine tails acted as heat sinks. In a 2018 a test was conducted using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program to look at the aerodynamic properties of several Star Wars starfighter models. Of those models which were tested, the N-1 was found to be the most aerodynamic of all with a drag coefficient of .1, which while somewhat poor compared to the real-life .02 rating of the F-4E Phantom was significantly better than all other starfighters tested. Porax-38 starfighter The Porax-38 appears in Revenge of the Sith as a starfighter piloted by the native Utapauns during the Battle of Utapau. Although featured in a full two-page spread in the Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections book, the fighter's role was significantly reduced in the final film. This was due to the fact that the P-38's digital model, being a late addition to the film, was not completed to the level originally planned, and so was relegated to a background craft. Soulless One The Soulless One was General Grievous' personal starfighter, a customized version of a Belbullab-22 starfighter, which made its first theatrical appearance in Revenge of the Sith (2005). After Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) defeated General Grievous on Utapau, he used Grievous' starfighter to escape from his clone troopers attempting to carry out Order 66 and rendezvoused with Yoda and Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits). TIE fighter (and variants) TIE fighters‚Äîand variants such as TIE interceptors and TIE bombers‚Äîappear throughout the original trilogy. They are usually not equipped with shields or a hyperdrive, which makes them mass- producible and allows for considerable weapon payloads, or alternatively, for high speed and agility. The pilot has to wear a pressurized suit, as TIE fighters also lack life support systems. U-wing The UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft is a Rebel troop transport/gunship model manufactured by Incom Corporation for the purpose of supporting special operations forces insertion and extraction into denied areas from strategic distances. Used to penetrate enemy zones to drop off Rebel infantry, provide close air support, and extract them upon mission completion. U-wings first appeared in the movie Rogue One, where they were pivotal in the transport and protection of the Rebel Alliance's ground forces during the Battle of Scarif. ;Origin and design Director Gareth Edwards wanted Rogue One to be grounded in the aesthetics of the Korean or Vietnam War in order to contrast it with the more World War II look of the original Star Wars film. Thus when it came time to design a unique ship for the film's heroes to travel around in, he wanted it to be akin to a \\"Huey\\" version of the X-wing. While experimenting with different models and names (\\"Z-wing, R-wing, Q-wing, etc.\\"), the final design picked was in part because it looked like an inverted X-wing. For filming interior scenes, a full-size U-wing cockpit was built and mounted on a manually controlled gimbal in front of a wall of LED panels. The panels were used instead of traditional film lighting so that more natural lighting could be simulated.Walker (2019), p. 114 ;Depiction In-universe material states that the UT-60 was the last starfighter design created by Incom Corporation before the company was nationalized by the Galactic Empire. Originally intended as a transport ship for couriers and planetary defense forces, the last of the UT-60D starfighters to be built were secured for the Rebel Alliance thanks to the efforts of Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits). Rebel mechanics and technicians transformed their U-wings into sturdy gunships and troop transports for Rebel Alliance Special Forces (SpecForces) making dangerous insertions into Imperial territory. The U-wing's engine configuration was inspired in part by the X-wing, and like the X-wing featured S-foils but in a variable-sweep wing format, opening them to improve atmospheric maneuverability and enlarge its deflector shield. However the ship was not designed for the tight turns necessary for dogfights, and while the U-wing did feature a hyperdrive for faster-than-light travel, extended operations with a full passenger compliment would quickly deplete the vessel's life support systems. The U-wing's two laser cannons could be supplemented by a pair of infantry heavy weapons handled by dedicated door gunners. V-19 Torrent The V-19 Torrent starfighter first appeared in the 2003 Clone Wars animated series and have appeared in other media related to the Clone Wars. Background material states the V-19 had impressive speed and maneuverability, making it a tricky starfighter to fly. It had three S-foils that functioned like those on the X-wing and was equipped with two laser cannons and twin concussion missile launchers. At the beginning of the Clone Wars, V-19 starfighters did not have hyperdrives for faster-than-light travel, instead relying on external hyperspace transport rings to which they would attached. Later models were modified to be equipped with an internal hyperdrive. V-wing The V-wing Fighter or Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-Wing made its theatrical appearance in the Revenge of the Sith (2005), as the Galactic Republic is formally transformed into the Galactic Empire. Originally, animation director Rob Coleman proposed that TIE Fighters be featured to signify this transition, but George Lucas pointed out that (in the film's chronology) there were nineteen years between the events of Revenge of the Sith and the original Star Wars. Allowing additional time for the TIE fighter to be introduced, a new starfighter was created instead, purposefully similar in both design and sound to the TIE fighter while also resembling the Jedi's Delta-7 starfighter.Walker (2019), p. 1010 According to Star Wars cannon, the V-wing's design combined elements of the ARC-170, V-19 and Delta-7, making it an ideal escort fighter. It was equipped with folding radiator wings, two ion engines and two laser cannons, but did not feature a hyperdrive or pressurized cockpit in order to save on weight and make the fighter faster and more maneuverable. Vulture Droid The Vulture Droid or Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid is a droid starfighter that made its theatrical appearance in The Phantom Menace (1999) and appeared again in Revenge of the Sith (2005). Original designs depicted the droid starfighter not as a droid itself, but instead piloted by a battle droid. In order to demonstrate that it was both a robotic being as well as vehicle, it was decide to give the vulture droid a transformative element, allowing its wings to fold down and serve as legs. Two 18\\" maquettes of the vulture droid were built - one in ship mode and one in walking mode - to help create the digital model. In order to represent the idea of three vulture droids sharing one \\"brain,\\" animators purposefully linked the motion of each three-ship flight when creating the climatic battle of The Phantom Menace.Walker (2019), p. 71 The vulture droid was a mainstay of Separatist starfighter squadrons during the Clone Wars. Equipped with four blaster cannons and two proton torpedo launchers, the vulture droid would transform into a four-legged walking configuration when not in flight. To overcome their lack of cunning and resourcefulness, vulture droids were used to attack en masse; originally controlled by a central command ship, these droids were later given a limited degree of independence. A variant of the vulture droid is the Hyena Bomber Droid, with a larger, sturdier hull and larger wings. It also has a second hull with downward-facing photoreceptors for precision bomb dropping. The Hyena Bomber Droid made its first appearance in the 2008 Clone Wars television series. X-wing The X-wing starfighter, named for the distinctive shape made when its S-Foils are in attack position, was a class of starfighter used by the Rebel Alliance in their conflict with the Galactic Empire. It made its theatrical debut, as the T-65B model, in Star Wars (1977) as the spacecraft piloted by Luke Skywalker and the Red Squadron when Luke destroyed the Death Star. The starfighter featured extensively in the Star Wars original trilogy and in the Expanded Universe that followed, and has been merchandised as a variety of toys and models. Y-wing The Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber are depicted as the primary fighter-bombers of the Galactic Republic, Rebel Alliance, New Republic, and the Resistance; being ideally suited for anti-shipping, close air support, and ground attack missions. They made their theatrical appearance in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977) and have featured in movies, television shows, and the Star Wars expanded universe's books, comics, and games. Z-95 Headhunter The Z-95 Headhunter is a class of starfighter which was first described in the Brian Daley's 1979 novel Han Solo at Stars' End as having swing-wings and a bubble cockpit. The 1988 Tatooine Manhunt adventure book for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game depicts the Z-95 as a precursor to the X-wing, but with only two wings, based on an early Joe Johnston production sketch. The Z-95 is featured variously in the Expanded Universe, including the Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron comic series, as well as in 2008's The Clone Wars television series, in which it is used by the Galactic Republic. The Z-95 Headhunter is described in the Star Wars Databank as \\"the forerunner of the ... X-wing\\", a versatile snub-fighter despite being outdated at the time of the Clone Wars. Incom Corporation originally designed the Z-95 for planetary defense forces, and while lacking many features like a hyperdrive or astromech droid it was appreciated for its armaments and internal environmental controls. The Republic commissioned upgraded models of the Z-95 for their clone pilots which featured more powerful weaponry and deflector shields, as well as superior endurance and adaptability.

It was shortly after sunriseWineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. Random House: New York, 2003: 197. and his father wrote to his sister: His parents had difficulty choosing a name for eight months. Possible names included George, Arthur, Edward, Horace, Robert, and Lemuel. His father referred to him for some time as \\"Bundlebreech\\" or \\"Black Prince\\", due to his dark curls and red cheeks. As a boy, Julian was well-behaved and good-natured.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. Random House: New York, 2003: 200. He was raised in a loving household, later reflecting: \\"it was almost appalling to be the subject of such limitless devotion and affection.\\"McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 184. Julian and his siblings were raised in a positive environment and his parents did not believe in harsh discipline or physical punishment.Miller, Peggy J. and Grace E. Cho. Self-esteem in Time and Place: How American Families Imagine, Enact, and Personalize a Cultural Ideal. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2018: 7. His father used Julian as an inspiration for the character of Sweet Fern in his children's books A Wonder- Book for Girls and Boys and Tanglewood Tales.Scharnhorst, Gary. Julian Hawthorne: The Life of a Prodigal Son. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2014: 13. The Hawthorne family eventually lived in Concord, Massachusetts, at a home they called The Wayside. There, Julian attended a school run by Franklin Benjamin Sanborn. The school was coeducational, though Julian's sisters Una and Rose did not attend. His parents disapproved particularly of dances hosted by the school. His mother Sophia wrote: \\"We entirely disapprove of this commingling of youths and maidens at the electric age in school. I find no end of ill effect from it, and this is why I do not send Una and Rose to your school.\\"Mellow, James R. Nathaniel Hawthorne in His Times. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 190: 537. Young Julian was close friends with his neighbors at the Orchard House, the Alcott family, and pursued a relationship with the older Abigail May Alcott while he was a young teenager. He later spread the rumor that he inspired the character Laurie in Louisa May Alcott's 1868 novel Little Women, which she denied.Scharnhorst, Gary. Julian Hawthorne: The Life of a Prodigal Son.

Years later, he wrote of the incident: After his father's death, Hawthorne considered himself head of the household, quit Harvard, and abandoned inklings to join the army. He took over his father's study in the tower of The Wayside and, his mother recalled, the difficult time \\"made a man of him, for he feels all the care of me and his sisters\\".Scharnhorst, Gary.

Hawthorne studied civil engineering in the United States and Germany, was engineer in the New York City Dock Department under General McClellan (1870-72), spent 10 years abroad, and met Minne Amelung. She and Hawthorne were married in Orange, New Jersey, on November 15, 1870.Scharnhorst, Gary. Julian Hawthorne: The Life of a Prodigal Son. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2014: 55. =Writing career= While in Europe Hawthorne wrote several novels: Bressant (1873); Idolatry (1874); Garth (1874); Archibald Malmaison (1879); and Sebastian Strome (1880). Hawthorne prepared an edition of his father's unfinished work Dr. Grimshawe's Secret (1883). His sister Rose, upon hearing of the book's announcement, had not known about the fragment and originally thought her brother was guilty of forgery or a hoax. She published the accusation in the New York Tribune on August 16, 1882, and claimed, \\"No such unprinted work has been in existence ... It cannot be truthfully published as anything but an experimental fragment\\". He defended himself from the charge, however, and eventually dedicated the book to his sister and her husband George Parsons Lathrop.Valenti, Patricia Dunlavy. To Myself a Stranger: A Biography of Rose Hawthorne Lathrop. Baton Rouge, LA: Louisiana State University Press, 1991: 67‚Äì68. In July 1883, Hawthorne was invited to participate as a lecturer at the Concord School of Philosophy by his former neighbors Amos Bronson Alcott and Sanborn. Hawthorne presented a version of a paper he had recently published, \\"Agnosticism in American Fiction\\", which criticized the emerging American Realism movement and took aim particularly at William Dean Howells and Henry James, whose works Hawthorne believed represented \\"life and humanity not in their loftier, but in their lesser manifestations\\". Hawthorne returned the following summer to present \\"Emerson as an American\\".Scharnhorst, Gary. Julian Hawthorne: The Life of a Prodigal Son. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2014: 111. Hawthorne published the first of two books about his parents, Nathaniel Hawthorne and His Wife, in 1884‚Äì85. The younger Hawthorne also wrote a critique of his father's novel The Scarlet Letter that was published in The Atlantic Monthly in April 1886. Julian Hawthorne published an article in the October 24, 1886, issue of the New York World based on a long interview with James Russell Lowell, who had recently served as a U.S. diplomat to England. In the article, titled \\"Lowell in a Chatty Mood\\", Hawthorne reported that Lowell offered various negative comments on British royalty and politicians, like saying that the Prince of Wales was \\"immensely fat\\". Lowell angrily complained that the article made him seem like \\"a toothless old babbler\\". Between 1887 and 1888, Hawthorne published a series of detective fiction novels following the character Inspector Barnes, including The Great Bank Robbery, An American Penman, A Tragic Mystery, Section 558, and Another's Crime.Panek, LeRoy Lad. The Origins of the American Detective Story. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, Inc.: 2006: 21. The character was strongly based on Hawthorne's friend and real-life detective Thomas F. Byrnes. In 1889 there were reports that Hawthorne was one of several writers who had, under the name of \\"Arthur Richmond\\", published in the North American Review devastating attacks on President Grover Cleveland and other leading Americans. Hawthorne denied the reports. In 1895, Hawthorne was one of several authors and journalists wooed to work for William Randolph Hearst and his syndicate of newspapers, along with writers Stephen Crane, Richard Harding Davis, Murat Halstead, Alfred Henry Lewis, Edgar Wilson Nye, Julian Ralph, and Edgar Saltus.Procter, Ben. William Randolph Hearst: The Early Years, 1863-1910. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998: 81. Hawthorne published a second book about his father, Hawthorne and His Circle, in 1903. In it, he responded to a remark from his father's friend Herman Melville that the famous author had a \\"secret\\". Julian dismissed this, claiming Melville was inclined to think so only because \\"there were many secrets untold in his own career\\", causing much speculation.Miller, Edwin Haviland.

As a journalist, he reported on the Indian Famine for Cosmopolitan magazine and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War for the New York Journal. =Fraud and imprisonment= An article on Hawthorne's conviction in Mining Science, 1913 In 1908, Hawthorne's old Harvard friend William J. Morton (a physician) invited Hawthorne to join in promoting some newly created mining companies in Ontario, Canada. Hawthorne made his writing and his family name central to the stock-selling campaigns. After complaints from shareholders, both Morton and Hawthorne were tried in New York City for mail fraud, and convicted in 1913.Julian Hawthorne Hawthorne was able to sell some three and a half million shares of stock in a nonexistent silver mine and served one year in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary.Nelson, Randy F. The Almanac of American Letters. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 259. Upon his release from prison, he wrote The Subterranean Brotherhood (1914), a nonfiction work calling for an immediate end to incarceration of criminals. Hawthorne argued, based on his own experience, that incarceration was inhumane, and should be replaced by moral suasion. Of the fraud with which he was charged he always maintained his innocence. =Final years and death= After his release from prison on October 15, 1913, Hawthorne returned to work as a journalist in Boston for the Boston American, for which he covered baseball spring training and interviewed George Stallings and Babe Ruth.Scharnhorst, Gary.

He resigned from the publication in November and moved to California, where he contributed to publications like the Los Angeles Herald and pitched movie screenplays which were never produced. He also shared a home with his lover Edith Garrigues.Scharnhorst, Gary. Julian Hawthorne: The Life of a Prodigal Son. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2014: 203‚Äì204. His wife Minne was living with family in Redding, Connecticut.

He was born in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, a son of Kilian and Barbara Long. Early life For twelve years the family resided in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, then in 1817 settled on a tract of government land a few miles north of Lisbon, Ohio, in Columbiana County. Here the family was brought into the Evangelical Association by the first Circuit riders of the Canton, Ohio Circuit. Joseph was converted to the Christian faith in 1818. Joseph married Catharine Hoy in 1826. They settled in the vicinity of his parental home, at what became known as Long's Crossing. This was Joseph's only dwelling place during his entire career. He was a typical pioneer minister, owning and operating a farm during most of his years as a Circuit Rider, Presiding Elder, and Bishop. The Long home was a gateway between the East and West, and it stood as a typical wayside lodging place for ministers in their travels to and from conference sessions in Pennsylvania throughout this early pioneer period. It was a welcome home for the itinerants in Ohio and the meeting place of the Long Class for many years. Early ministry Joseph entered the Traveling Ministry of the Evangelical Association in 1822, the first pastoral recruit from this pioneer Evangelical work in Ohio. During 1827, the first year of the history of the Western Conference of the Evangelical Association, Joseph and the Rev. Adam Klinefelter shared the responsibilities of attending to the Ohio preaching fields. Joseph was the first elected Presiding Elder of the Western Conference, overseer of the Ohio work 1828-33. In 1833 he felt the urgent need of giving more attention to his home and family. For the next ten years, Joseph was a model local preacher, living at home and preaching only in the immediate neighborhood. Joseph reentered the active ranks of Traveling Ministry in 1843. In the same year he was re-elected as Presiding Elder. He served on the Tabor District until October 1843 when the General Conference chose him as the third Bishop of the Evangelical Association. Biographical reflections A. Stapleton, in a biography of Bishop Long, states: :\\"Bishop Long was in every way a remarkable man. In the pulpit he was a master... Sometimes he became impressively grand and eloquent in his discourses. He was one of the profoundest thinkers the church has ever had. With mental endowments of the highest order and a life of very close fellowship with God, he was able to present the truth with overwhelming force and power. At conference sessions his sermons were especially impressive and powerful. :In 1857, at the session of the East Pennsylvania Conference in New York City, he preached an ordination sermon from Acts 20:28. This sermon was described by hearers as having been overwhelmingly grand and impressive. The great deep of almost every heart was broken up. 'Fathers in Israel' wept like children, and many vows of fidelity were recorded in heaven as the result of that sermon.\\" Death and memorial After Bishop Long died in June 1869, the Ohio Conference of the Evangelical Association in 1870 passed the following resolution: :\\"Whereas, his departure falls especially heavily on us, as a conference, as he for many years dwelt among us and gave us counsel as a devoted father would to his children in whom he had delight, and in whose welfare he had the deepest interest, therefore, Resolved, That...we will highly prize his good advice so often given us, and cherish his persevering and self-sacrificing spirit in the cause of the church, and the work of the Master. May the mantle of Bishop Long rest upon us and may we have still more of that loyalty and self-denying spirit which he as our leader ever evinced in the interest of our beloved Zion.\\" See also *List of Bishops of the United Methodist Church References *Behney, J.

PFAA had been the bargaining agent for Northwest flight attendants from June 2003, when its members voted to end their 26-year association with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, until the membership voted to be represented by the Association of Flight Attendants in July 2006. The independent union came to power on a platform of internal, democratic control of union affairs as opposed to top-down centralized power of large labor groups. PFAA's standing increased dramatically in August 2005 with the implementation of \\"dues check-off,\\" which automatically deducts a flight attendant's union dues from each paycheck. For two years prior to that date, individual flight attendants were responsible for submitting dues to the union, and hundreds of members remained in arrears. The union continued to be controversial with rank-and-file members, with various factions supporting a return to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters or a change to other unions affiliated with a larger labor coalition, like the Association of Flight Attendants, or a redoubled effort to increase solidarity behind the independent PFAA. Both the Association of Flight Attendants and the Transport Workers Union of America conducted organizational campaigns for the membership. In addition to doing battle with other unions seeking to represent its members, the PFAA fought with Northwest Airlines management who, under bankruptcy protection, were seeking to dissolve the flight attendants' collective bargaining agreement. In November 2005 the PFAA agreed to temporary concessions which reduced the average flight attendant's hourly pay by approximately 21% and total compensation by approximately 30%. The company proposed additional cost-cutting measures which would outsource to foreign nationals up a third of the flight attendant positions and dramatically reduce the compensation and benefits of those who remain. Evidence of the labor turmoil at the airline was seen in December 2005 when over 500 attendants applied for 160 one-year layoffs. Many employees are reluctant to permanently sever their ties to the company as pay and benefits accrue on the basis of seniority. Nearly half of Northwest flight attendants had more than 15 years of service to the company, and nearly three-fourths were over the age of 40. On July 6 Northwest flight attendants elected the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA as their new bargaining representative. AFA-CWA received 4,349 votes. The total vote exceeded the Railway Labor Act requirement that 50 percent plus one of eligible flight attendants vote in the election in order to change representation.

The noted legal scholar Max Radin was his older brother. Biography A son of the rabbi Adolph Moses Radin, Paul Radin was born in the cosmopolitan Polish city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1883. In 1884 his family moved to Elmira, New York. He entered the public school system and graduated from the City College of New York in 1902. There, he became interested in studying history and came under the influence of James Harvey Robinson. Between 1905 and 1907 Radin studied in Europe, first in Munich and then the University of Berlin. As a result, he became interested in anthropology. In 1907 he returned to the United States and became a student of Franz Boas at Columbia, where he counted Edward Sapir and Robert Lowie among his classmates. He engaged in years of productive fieldwork among the Winnebago (HocƒÖk) Indians, primarily from 1908-1912. Publications from this research include his doctoral dissertation, earned in 1911 and culminated in 1923 with the publication of his magnum opus, The Winnebago Tribe. In 1929, as a result of his fieldwork, he was able to publish a grammar of the nearly extinct language of the Wappo people of the San Francisco Bay area. Beginning in the 1940s, Radin was monitored by the FBI, who believed him to be a communist. This monitoring continued until his death. In 1952 Radin moved to Lugano, Switzerland, where he worked for the Bollingen Foundation. In 1956 he returned to the US to take a position at Brandeis, where he was chairman of the Department of Anthropology. Late in his career he edited several anthologies of folk tales from different continents. His most enduring publication to date is The Trickster (1956), which includes essays by the pioneering scholar of Greek mythology, Karl Ker√©nyi, and the prominent psychoanalyst C. G. Jung. Radin taught at a number of colleges and universities, never staying at any one more than a few years. At various times he held appointments at University of California, Berkeley; Mills College, Fisk University, Black Mountain College, Kenyon College, and the University of Chicago. He concluded his career as chairman of the Department of Anthropology at Brandeis. Sources and further reading=Publications by Radin= *1912.

First appointed in 1914 a librarian, he was the Principal of Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi from 1923 to 1937. He was also the editor of the Sarasvati Bhavana Granthamala (Sarasvati Bhavana Texts) during that period. In 1964 he received the Sahitya Akademi Award, given by the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, for his research treatise on Tantra, Tantrik Vangmaya Men Shaktadrishti. In the same year he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour given by Government of India. In 1971 he was conferred the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, the highest literary honour awarded by the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters. Early life and education Kaviraj was the posthumous son of Vaikunthanath, a Bengali scholar of philosophy. He was born in village Dhamrai, in the present Dhaka District, capital of Bangladesh. After receiving his early education at Dhamrai and Kanthalia villages, he joined the K. L. Jubilee High School, Dhaka in seventh class, and studied there till tenth class. In 1906 he moved to Jaipur, where after four years he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Maharaja College, Jaipur. He obtained his master's degree from the University of Allahabad. Here he studied with scholars Madhusudan Ojha, Shasdhar Tarkchudamani and others. In 1910 he moved to Devnathpura, Varanasi, and started his postgraduate studies, passing the M.A. from the University of Allahabad in 1914, with first merit position in the first class. Career The final phase of his education started at Varanasi under the guidance of Arthur Venis, who appointed him as a librarian of the Sarasvati Bhavan Library of the Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi, where he worked from 1914 to 1920. This period allowed him to pursue research in Tantra. It was at Varanasi that Kaviraj was exposed to various facets of ancient Tantric philosophy. In 1918, he met Vishuddhananda Paramahansa, a yogi in Kashi who demonstrated Yogic powers who was trained in Gyanganj (near Tibet). In 1924 he became principal of the Government Sanskrit College, later Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi. He was the Chief Editor of Sarasvati Bhavana Texts, Sarasvati Bhavana Granthamala.

In the following years, he pursued both his sadhana and scholarly research in Tantra. He also started looking after his Guru's ashram in Varanasi. He was fond of Kashi (Varanasi) and never left it except to accept his Padma Vibhushan. In his later years, along with the scholar Sri Anirvan, he devoted himself to the study of Kashmir Shaivism. In his later years he became an ardent devotee of mystic Anandamayi Ma, whom he first met in 1928. In 1934 he was awarded the title of Mahamahopadhyaya in recognition of his service Sanskrit scholarship. Later in life, he remained Head of newly established Yoga-Tantra Department at the Varanaseya Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya in Varanasi from 1964 to 1969.

In the film, he is a \\"Brooklyn-loving\\" fan of the New York Knicks, sports, and Air Jordans (the basketball shoes worn by Michael Jordan). This led to late 1980s and early 1990s appearances in Nike Air Jordan commercials alongside Jordan and Mars becoming well known for his use of the phrase, \\"It's gotta be da shoes.\\" The ad campaign with Lee as Mars has been credited as a landmark in the evolution of sneakers into massively profitable items of fashion. As of January 2011, Nike had resumed using the character for its Air Jordan \\"Spiz'ike\\" line of shoes. In the TV remake he is played by Anthony Ramos. In the April 30, 2010 episode of the genealogy television show Who Do You Think You Are? that focused on Spike Lee's search for his mother's ancestors, Lee said that he had called his grandmother to ask for a name for the character. His grandmother gave him the name \\"Mars\\". In the episode, Lee's research finds that Mars was the name of his great-great-grandfather (his grandmother's grandfather). In March 2015 a Capital One Quicksilver credit card television commercial features Samuel L. Jackson, Charles Barkley and Lee. During the commercial's hotel check-in, Lee uses the pseudonym Mars Blackmon to register his room.

CHIME enables its members and business partners to collaborate; exchange ideas and technology; develop professionally; and advocate the effective use of information management to improve the health and healthcare in the communities they serve. CHIME is directed by an elected 16-member board composed of leading chief information officers (CIOs) and CHIME Foundation representatives. History CHIME was founded in 1992 with the dual objective of serving the professional development needs of healthcare CIOs and advocating the more effective use of information management within healthcare. Membership Currently, CHIME has more than 2,700 members across the globe. Members of CHIME are the highest ranking IT executives within their healthcare organization or facility. While the majority hold the CIO job title, having that title is not a requirement for membership as long as they have equivalent job responsibilities. Many members are the senior IT executive within a division of a larger organization, such as the CIO of a hospital within a larger healthcare system. Some additional high-level executives, such as division leaders or regional leaders may be eligible, as well. A typical CHIME member oversees the information services department and chairs the information technology steering committee within their organization. Additional responsibilities often include telecommunications, medical records, and health informatics. CHIME members represent a variety of provider organizations, including large hospital systems, community hospitals and for- profit hospitals. In addition to CIOs from hospitals, CHIME welcomes all CIOs who are employed by organizations with responsibility for direct patient care, including physician practice groups, clinics, and others. Additionally, members may be accepted from other healthcare organizations such as Payers/HMOs, government agencies, state hospital associations, and RHIOs. Healthcare CIOs play a central role in implementing IT systems that digitize patient records to achieve meaningful use of electronic medical records, enabling their organizations to qualify for incentive funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Certification and Education In July 2009, CHIME launched the Certified Healthcare CIO (CHCIO) Program, the first certification program designed specifically for CIOs and IT executives in the healthcare industry. The CHCIO Program is a member-led initiative. CHIME members oversee the strategic direction of the program as well as write and review all questions on the CHCIO Examination. One of the goals of the program is to help healthcare IT executives transition to and through CIO 2.0 to CIO 3.0, heavily emphasizing the emerging role of the CIO as a member of the C-Suite leadership team, as opposed to the old model of a CIO as an infrastructure and services manager. To become certified, candidates must hold a baccalaureate degree, pass the CHCIO Examination, have three years of experience as a CIO or equivalent, and earn a minimum number of continuing education units (CEUs) to maintain certification. As of July 5, 2018, there are 495 CHCIOs and 84 CHCIO-Eligible Professionals according to CHIME. Advocacy leadership and StateNet CHIME serves as a voice of the healthcare IT executive within the US, informing and influencing public policy leaders and other officials on the role of information technology in transforming the delivery of healthcare, while providing members with the latest information regarding new healthcare IT legislation, regulations and policies, including the recent HITECH legislation, which includes funding for the implementation and meaningful use of electronic health records. Ten CHIME members who belong to a Policy Steering Committee help review proposed federal regulations and rules, and provide direction and comments on regulations impacting the use of IT in healthcare. CHIME Foundation The CHIME Foundation is a non-profit organization composed of select healthcare IT vendors and professional services firms. CHIME Foundation members benefit from the unique opportunity to partner and collaborate with more than 1,800 CHIME member CIOs.  Publications CHIME regularly releases opinions, guidance and information on matters of importance to the healthcare IT community. In August 2010, CHIME issued the CIO's Guide to Implementing EHRs in the HITECH Era, which included best practices and steps health care organizations should take to successfully implement EHRs, from the initial planning stages through the final documentation of results. Nearly 170 of hospital CIOs were involved in compiling the information included in the guidebook. The complete guide in PDF format is available at the CHIME Web site.

It is structurally similar to acetone; however, its reactivity is markedly different. It a colourless, hygroscopic, nonflammable, highly reactive gas characterized by a musty odour.CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards The most common form of this substance is hexafluoroacetone sesquihydrate (1.5 H2O), which is a hemihydrate of hexafluoropropane-2,2-diol , a geminal diol . Synthesis The industrial route to HFA involves treatment of hexachloroacetone with HF: :(CCl3)2CO + 6 HF ‚Üí (CF3)2CO + 6 HCl Hexafluoropropylene oxide rearranges to give HFA. In the laboratory, HFA can be prepared in a two step process from perfluoropropene. In the first step KF catalyzes the reaction of the alkene with elemental sulfur to give the 1,3-dithietane [(CF3)2CS]2. This species is then oxidized by iodate to give (CF3)2CO. Uses Hexafluoroacetone is used in the production of hexafluoroisopropanol: :(CF3)2CO + H2 ‚Üí (CF3)2CHOH It is also used as a precursor to hexafluoroisobutylene, a monomer used in polymer chemistry, and as a building block in the synthesis of midaflur, bisphenol AF, 4,4‚Ä≤-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride, and alitame. Reactivity Hexafluoroacetone is an electrophile. Nucleophiles attack at the carbonyl carbon. In water, hexafluoroacetone predominantly exists as the hydrate. The equilibrium constant (Keq) for the formation of this geminal diol is 106 M‚àí1. The analogous equilibrium for acetone is an unfavorable 10‚àí3 M‚àí1. Hexafluoroacetone-hydrates are acidic. In an analogous reaction, ammonia adds to hexafluoroacetone to give the hemiaminal (CF3)2C(OH)(NH2) which can be dehydrated with phosphoryl chloride to give the imine (CF3)2CNH..

Although these battles were relatively small achievements in light of what would follow it marked the first time that the Hindenburg Line was pierced.  Background  Three divisions of the Third Army attacked the village of Havrincourt: the 62nd Division, New Zealand Division and 37th Division. Defending Havrincourt were four German divisions, from the 3rd and 10th Corps. In the normal course of events, the 62nd Division would not have been there but they had been given the Havrincourt sector out of respect for their performance there in 1917, the 62nd [West Riding] Division took Havrincourt and the 37th took Trescourt.  Description  Despite their numerical superiority and strong fortifications within the town, the Germans were unable to hold their position and by the day's end Havrincourt was in British hands. The victory was not particularly showy or impressive, but it highlighted a growing lack of fighting spirit among the German soldiers on the Western Front. While some took no notice of this small battle, others noted its significance ‚Äì indeed, Byng himself saw it as a turning point of sorts; :\\"He reckons his most important day with the 3rd Army to have been the capture of Havrincourt by the 56th Division in September 1918.

He had been convicted in 1985 of the 1984 rape and first-degree murder of a nine-year-old girl in Rosedale, Maryland. By the time an appeal based on the DNA evidence was underway, his sentence had been commuted to two consecutive life sentences. He gained release from prison in 1993 and a full exoneration in 2004. Conviction and sentence to death Bloodsworth served in the Marines, and was honorably discharged at the end of his term. He lived in coastal Maryland, where he worked as a waterman, harvesting shellfish and fish. In 1985 he was convicted of sexual assault, rape, and first-degree premeditated murder in the 1984 case of Dawn Hamilton, a nine-year-old girl in Rosedale, Maryland. Five eyewitnesses stated that he had been with the victim, but he continued to maintain his innocence throughout his trial and subsequent incarceration. In 1992, while in jail, Bloodsworth read an account of how DNA testing had led to the conviction, in England, of Colin Pitchfork in the killings of Dawn Ashworth and Lynda Mann. This resulted in the use of DNA to gain the exoneration of an earlier suspect in the case, who had falsely confessed to Ashworth's murder. Hoping to prove his innocence, Bloodsworth pushed to have the biological evidence against him tested by this new forensic technique. Initially, the available evidence in the case  traces of semen in the victim's underwear  was thought to have been destroyed; however, it was eventually located in a paper bag in the judge's chambers. Testing proved that the semen did not match Bloodsworth's DNA profile. In 1993 Bloodsworth was released after more than nine years in prison. Though released from prison, Bloodsworth was not formally exonerated. In 2003, nearly a decade after Bloodsworth's release, prisoner DNA evidence added to state and federal databases resulted in a match to the real killer, Kimberly Shay Ruffner. A month after the 1984 murder, Ruffner had been sentenced to 45 years for an unrelated burglary, attempted rape and assault with intent to murder. He had been incarcerated in a cell one floor below Bloodsworth's own cell. In a 2009 guest lecture at Florida Atlantic University, Bloodsworth said that he and Ruffner sometimes spotted each other during workouts. In light of the new DNA evidence, Ruffner was charged in Maryland for the rape and murder of the girl; in 2004 he pleaded guilty to the 1984 murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. This resulted in the full exoneration of Bloodsworth in 2004. During his time in prison, Bloodsworth became a Roman Catholic.https://www.facebook.com/1lifela/videos/931130063701744/ Life after prison Bloodsworth served as a program officer for The Justice Project. He helped gain support for the Innocence Protection Act (IPA) of 2001, later included in the omnibus Justice for All Act of 2004. Among other federal funding initiatives, the IPA established the \\"Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Program,\\" intended to help states defray the costs of post- conviction DNA testing. Bloodsworth has served as a consultant on the death penalty and a prominent public speaker against it. He helped gain repeal of the death penalty statute in Maryland.

Dodge Brothers became a Chrysler subsidiary in 1928 and truck production moved to Chrysler's car plant at Kew. Dodges built there were known as \\"Dodge Kews\\" and the (partly Canadian sourced) American model cars built beside them, \\"Chrysler Kews\\". During the Second World War this Chrysler factory was part of London Aircraft Production Group and built Handley Page Halifax aircraft assemblies. Dodge (some vehicles badged Fargo or De Soto) truck production was merged with Commer and Karrier at Dunstable in 1965. The Public Record Office is now on the site of the Chrysler plant. =Chrysler Europe= By 1970, the Rootes Group had been taken over (in stages) by Chrysler Europe, with support from the British Government which was desperate to support the ailing British motor industry. The Dodge brand (also used by Chrysler in the USA) began to take precedence on all commercial models. The last vestige of Karrier was probably in the Dodge 50 Series, which began life badged as a (Chrysler) Dodge but with a Karrier Motor Company VIN (vehicle identification number) plate. Peugeot and Renault Chrysler eventually withdrew from UK operations, selling the business to Peugeot. The new owner had little interest in heavy trucks and the factory was then run in conjunction with Renault V√©hicules Industriels, (then part of Renault though now Volvo).

Ltd. to produce the 'Karrier-Clough' trolley-omnibus which Clough would market. This arrangement continued until 1933, when Karrier began marketing the trolleybuses themselves. Despite receiving multiple orders in 1933‚Äì4, Karrier went into receivership, leading to the takeover by Humber in 1934, thus becoming part of the Rootes Group. Trolleybus manufacture was moved to Rootes's Sunbeam subsidiary's factory at Wolverhampton, where it continued up until World War II. During the periods in wartime, when production was allowed, only one model was produced, the W4, which could be badged either as Sunbeam or Karrier. Post-war, production continued briefly before the trolleybus portion of the company was sold to Brockhouse in 1946. =Rootes Group products= 1961 Gamecock water tender 1961 Karrier van; Mr. Whippy ice cream‚Äîoriginal at the Albert Dock, Liverpool in 2013 Bradford Trolleybus 735 (1946) at Black Country Living Museum In the late 1950s and 1960s some Karrier vehicles were fitted with the Rootes TS3 two-stroke opposed piston diesel engine. Other engines used in this period include Humber Hawk 4-cylinder petrol engines (L-Head and OHC), Humber Super Snipe 6-cylinder (L-Head and OHV) and Perkins Diesels. At Luton, the only designs carried over from the previous era were the three wheeler and the six-wheel trolleybus chassis. The trolleybus business became integrated with that of Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles Limited following Sunbeam's purchase by the Rootes group. In 1946 J. Brockhouse and Co Limited of West Bromwich, the engineering group, bought Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles but sold the trolley-bus part of the business to Guy Motors Limited in September 1948.City News In Brief.

The Drava River marks the southern boundary of the settlement. Geography Located at the Croatian border and the River Drava, the town is surrounded by the Danube-Drava National Park. It is the seat of Barcs District. History Barcs was first mentioned between 1389 and 1417 in official documents as part of the lordship of Segesd. Its castle was first mentioned in 1460 which belonged to J√°nos and Istv√°n Bakonyai at that time. In 1467 the Marzcali family owned the settlement. The Castle of Barcs was in the hands of Gergely Horv√°th de G√°j in 1472. Istv√°n Bakonyai died in 1480 and did not leave anheir, therefore his possession went to P√©ter, Provost of Transylvania and royal chancellor and Orb√°n Nagylucsei treasurer, furthermore the brothers of P√©ter, Bal√°zs and J√°nos Nagylucsei as a royal gift. Orb√°n Nagylucsei (Orb√°n D√≥czy) Bishop of Eger owned it in 1489. Members of the B√°thori family got Barcs in 1495 from the king. According to the tax register of 1550 its owner was Andr√°s B√°thori. After the Turkish occupation the Hungarian Kingdom lost the continuous control of this region. The Ottoman Porte's tax register list 46 houses there between 1565 and 1566. It was also in the hands of Ferenc N√°dasdy between 1598 and 1599. The tithe register of Pannonhalma Abbey mentioned the settlement under the suzerainty of the Castle of Szent Gy√∂rgy in 1660. In the winter of 1664 the army of Mikl√≥s Zr√≠nyi approached the castle. The Turkish soldiers fearing the defeat left the castle. Zr√≠nyi burnt it down. In 1677 Gy√∂rgy Sz√©ch√©nyi Archdiocese of Kalocsa got Barcs from Leopold I. Between 1715 and 1733 the Sz√©chenyi family became its owner and in 1835 it was already under the suzerainty of Erd≈ëcsokonya. In 1720 the village was half Hungarian and half Croatian. There were also some Bosniak and ≈†okci families. The following Croatian people lived in Barcs in 1720: Ivan Persics, Petrus Trifanovics, Stefan Odelics, Mathia Perics, Marcin Bosrineƒá, Georg Jalenovecz, Step. Ostarsics, Mato Pavo, Vitus Kockan, Jakobus Simoncsics, Joh. Gaglas, Mich. Jarcsok, Mathia Sokol. After 1728 the Kozarics, Kalinovic, Marics, Kukoriƒá new Croatian families settled there. During the 1730s 21 Croatian and 14 Hungarian families lived in the village. Until 1961 other Hungarian and Croatian families arrived in Barcs. The Croats were namely Tardinacz, a Hencsar, Simotics and Ottarsics. Also several families moved away.L√°szl√≥ Szita : Somogy megyei nemzetis√©gek telep√ºl√©st√∂rt√©nete a XVIII-XIX. sz√°zadban - Somogyi Almanach 52. (Kaposv√°r, 1993) At the beginning of the 20th century Imre Sz√©chenyi had lands there. In the winter of 1848 Josip Jelaƒçiƒá Ban of Croatia attacked Barcs. A troop of border guards started to shoot the settlement with cannons. One of the cannon balls still can be seen on the wall of the Roman Catholic church. The Croats occupied the village. But after some months they had to retreat. According to the 1849 census Barcs had 1,594 residents of which 300 Hungarians, 787 Germans and 487 Slavic-speaking people. There were 1,452 Roman Catholics, 113 Protestants, 7 Orthodox and 2 Jews. Four years later in 1953 there were 1,438 residents of which 254 were Hungarians, 725 Germans, 429 Croats, 15 Jews and 14 Romani.L√°szl√≥ Szita : Somogy megyei nemzetis√©gek telep√ºl√©st√∂rt√©nete a XVIII-XIX. sz√°zadban - Somogyi Almanach 52. (Kaposv√°r, 1993) There was a great conflagration in 1857. The oldest building of Barcs is the salt and tobacco warehouse which was built in Classicist style, today it is a protected dwelling house. It was used for storing wares from ships which transported them on the River Drava. During the second half of the 20th century Barcs started to develop intensively its industry until the Treaty of Trianon. After the First World War agriculture related production facilities like leather and flax fabrics, slaughterhouses, milk and cheese factories as well as distilleries were built. Its electric system was also built up at that time. Dr√°vap√°lfalva merged into Barcs in 1928. In 1910 it had 6,415 residents of which 4,529 were Hungarians, 1,477 Germans and 238 Croats. According to their religious affiliation there were 5,314 Roman Catholics, 289 Calvinists and 659 Jews. In 1918 it came under Serbian occupation and the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs claimed the territory despite the fact that it was adjudicated to Hungary in the Treaty of Trianon. For some months it became part of the Serbian-Hungarian Baranya-Baja Republic. During the Soviet occupation the structure of the industry transformed. The construction material production, mill industry, wood processing and the chemical industry got stronger and became the leading sectors in the economy of Barcs. It got town rights in 1979 when Dr√°vaszentes and Somogytarn√≥ca merged. On October 27, 1991 in the night a Yugoslavian aircraft flew over the territory of Hungary and threw warheads at the edge of the town. Luckily, there were no personal injuries. Just some houses damaged seriously. =Dr√°vap√°lfalva= Dr√°vap√°lfalva was first mentioned in medieval documents and belonged to the Gy≈ër genus. Mikl√≥s Dersfi got this village in 1346.

It belonged to P√°l Sz√©ch√©nyi in 1856, later to Ferenc Sz√©ch√©nyi. At the beginning of the 20th century M√≥r Kremsier became its owner who had a distillery and a steam mill in Belcsa-puszta. In 1880 the half of the houses burnt down. It had 1,179 residents in 1910 of which 819 were Hungarians, 275 Germans and 81 Romani. According to their religious affiliation there were 1,026 Roman Catholics, 106 Calvinists and 23 Jews.

The Sz√©ch√©nyi family settled Hungarians in the village. There were also some Slovene families who came to Dr√°vaszentes in 1760, namely the Palecsnik, Melanecz, Vojkovic, Novalovrecz, Skafer, Vinkovics families. The majority of the population spoke Hungarian, therefore these families assimilated in just a few generations. Its Roman Catholic church was built in 1895. There was a huge conflagration in 1881. The village was known for its local manufactured iron tools. According to the 1910 census it had 673 residents of which 672 were Hungarians, furthermore 652 Roman Catholics, 10 Calvinists and 9 Jews.L√°szl√≥ Szita : Somogy megyei nemzetis√©gek telep√ºl√©st√∂rt√©nete a XVIII-XIX. sz√°zadban - Somogyi Almanach 52.

(Kaposv√°r, 1993) =Aranyas= Aranya was first mentioned between 1332 and 1337 in the papal tithe register and it had already its own parish. In 1389 it belonged to Segesd. In the Ottoman Porte's tax register there were two independent villages with this name: Fels≈ë Aranyas () ans Als√≥ Aranyas (), both with 5 households respectively. Around 1565 and 1566 they had 4 houses. In 1571 Fels≈ë Arnas had 2 and Als√≥ Arnas had 7 households. It was uninhabited and belonged to Zsigmond Sz√©ch√©nyi between 1726 and 1733. =Tarn√≥czagy√∂ngy√∂s= Tarn√≥czagy√∂ngy√∂s was formerly known as Gy√∂rgy√∂s as belonged to the M√©rey and Lengyel families.

The team included his brother-in-law, Ladislao Kubala, who had married Dauƒç√≠k's sister, Anna Viola Dauƒç√≠k, in 1947. Hungaria played a series of friendlies against Madrid Select XI, a Spain XI and Espa√±ol and during these matches, Kubala was spotted by Josep Samitier, then chief scout at Barcelona. Kubala was offered a contract and as part of the deal, Dauƒç√≠k became Barcelona coach in 1950. =CF Barcelona= Dauƒç√≠k coached Barcelona during one of the club's most successful periods. As well as Nicolae Simatoc‚ÄìKubala, the team also included Juan Zambudio Velasco, Antoni Ramallets and Joan Segarra.

If away goals had counted double, Atl√©tico would have progressed to the final. However, the tie went to a replay and Real won 2‚Äì1 in Zaragoza. =Later years= Dauƒç√≠k remained in demand as a manager throughout his career. After leaving Atl√©tico Madrid in 1959, he had a spell at Porto during the 1959‚Äì60 season. He then spent two years at Real Betis between 1960 and 1962. While there, he gave a La Liga debut to his son Yanko Daucik. Dauƒç√≠k then had a season each with Real Murcia and Sevilla before he joined Real Zaragoza in 1966. He took over Real towards the end of the 1965‚Äì66 season, leading them to victory in the Copa del General√≠simo final when they beat Atl√©tico Bilbao 2‚Äì0. They also reached the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final, but after beating Barcelona 1‚Äì0 in the home-leg, Real eventually lost 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. In 1967, Dauƒç√≠k moved to Canada to coach the Toronto Falcons of the National Professional Soccer League. This proved to be something of a family reunion as he was joined at the club by his son Yanko, son-in-law Ladislao Kubala and grandson Branko Kubala. After returning to Spain, he had spells at Elche, Espanyol and Colonia Moscard√≥, among others.http://hemeroteca.elmundodeportivo.es/preview/1980/09/11/pagina-19/1042925/pdf.html?search=fernando%20daucik%20levante A book about him, ‚Äú√ötek na laviƒçku Barcelony‚Äù (Escape to the Bench of Barcelona), was published in 2017 by Slovak football writer Mojm√≠r Sta≈°ko.

She is known for her extensive range of two and a half octaves, precise intonation, charm, portamento, vocal fluidity, and impressive coloratura. Her voice was regarded as flute-like, sweet, pure, light, and brilliant. She had an important international singing career, chiefly at the New York Metropolitan Opera and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London.McHenry, Robert (1983). Famous American Women: A Biographical Dictionary from Colonial Times to the Present. Courier Dover Publications.  Early life  Sembrich was born at Wisniewczyk which lies in the Polish region of Autro-Hungarian occupied Galicia, now part of Ukraine. The young Sembrich first studied violin and piano with her father, and earned money to support her family and pay for studies by playing for parties of nobility. She would often play in the town center, and became well known and liked by locals. An elderly man nicknamed Dziadek Lanowitch, took a liking to her and at age ten sent her to the Lemberg Conservatory in what was then Lwow, Poland.  Education  While at the Lemberg Conservatory she studied piano with her future husband Wilhelm Stengel and violin with Sigismond Bruckmann. When she was sixteen years old Stengel took her to perform for Franz Liszt in Weimar. Liszt encouraged her to develop her voice: ‚ÄòSing, sing for the world, for you have the voice of an angel.‚Äô This led Sembrich to pursue musical studies in Vienna and Milan. In the Autumn of 1875 she began her studies at the Vienna Conservatory, studying voice with Joseph Hellmesberger Sr., piano with Julius Epstein, and voice with Viktor Rokitansky. After a year it was decided to give up study of the violin and piano and fully devote the young student to voice lessons. She arrived in Milan in September 1876 to study with one of the most renowned vocal teachers on the continent, namely Giovanni Battista Lamperti, son of the eminent teacher Francesco Lamperti, with whom she would later study in 1885.  Career  After less than a year of study with the younger of the two Lampertis, Sembrich made her debut in opera at Athens as Elvira in Bellini's I puritani on June 3, 1877. She sang not only Puritani, but also Dinorah, Lucia di Lammermoor, Robert le diable and La sonnambula! It is a testament to her proper early training and intelligence that a 19-year-old soprano could learn so many roles in a foreign language so quickly. Her letters indicate that she could speak English, Polish, German, French, and Italian. That year she also she married her piano teacher, Wilhelm Stengel. When in Athens, she first appeared under the name ‚ÄúMarcella Bosio‚Äù, because she felt that her last name was too hard for audiences to pronounce. Not long after she opted to adopt her mother's maiden name, Sembrich, instead. While her success was solid, she still had much to learn. After Athens she was to appear with the Vienna Opera, but due to pregnancy she broke the contract. During her pregnancy and after the birth of her first son, Wilhelm Marcel, she continued her vocal studies, this time with Marie Seebach and Richard Lewey in Vienna. After a long and frustrating search for an opera engagement, she was hired as a guest at the Dresden Royal Opera House in September 1878, debuting as Lucia. Her success was immediate and she was dubbed the \\"Polish Patti.\\" She was immediately made a member of the company and remained in Dresden battling opera house politics, until 1880. She broke her contract at Dresden and sang a number of concerts to raise money to go to London. She had an auspicious audition with the impresario Ernest Gye at Covent Garden and signed a contract there for five seasons. In June 1880 she created a sensation in her debut at Covent Garden as Lucia in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. She became a great favorite in the characters of Zerlina, Don Giovanni; Susanna, The Marriage of Figaro; Konstanze, The Abduction from the Seraglio; Lady Harriet/Martha, Martha; and, of course, Lucia. In 1883, Marcella Sembrich went to the United States to sing in the newly founded Metropolitan Opera company. She made her Met debut as Lucia in the company premiere of Lucia di Lammermoor on October 24, 1883. Sembrich sang more debut roles than any other singer in the company‚Äôs history. She was the Met's first Queen of the Night in Die Zauberfl√∂te, Elvira in I Puritani, Violetta in La Traviata, Amina in La Sonnambula, Gilda in Rigoletto, Marguerite in Les Huguenots and Rosina in Il Barbiere di Siviglia. She was also the first to record on the Mapleson Cylinders backstage at The Met. Due to the terrific financial loss of the company that year, Italian opera was abandoned and German opera reigned supreme at the Met for the next dozen years or so.Matters, S. (2010, September 27). Marcella Sembrich Opera Museum. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiqgYSBrm3U In 1888 Sembrich relocated to Berlin. For next three decades, Sembrich traveled across the United States and Europe singing in major cities incloding Dresden, London, Madrid, Paris, St. Petersburg, New York. Sembrich was a tremendous favorite at the Italian Opera infrom 1890 to 1897. Sembrich returned to the Met in 1898. In total, she sang more than 450 Met performances in her 11 seasons there, and remained associated with the company until 1909, when the silver jubilee of her Met debut was celebrated with a farewell gala. She gave recitals until 1917. Sembrich would often end her recitals with piano or violin performances. Many that knew her claim that her experience with the violin made her a sensible and instinctual singer. The diva also made it her mission to promote Polish art as much as possible; her concerts almost always featured a piece by a Polish composer. After this date, she started the vocal programs at both Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and at the Juilliard School of Music, where she ended up teaching once she retired. Her students included Alma Gluck, Hulda Lashanska, Queena Mario, Edna de Lima, Dusolina Giannini, Josephine Antoine, Natalie Bodanya, Polyna Stoska, Jane Pickens. Additionally, some of her students in turn became important vocal teachers around the country. Among them were Anna Hamlin (teacher of Judith Raskin) at Smith College, Edith Piper and Florence Page Kimball (teacher of Leontyne Price) at Juilliard, Eufemia Gregory (teacher of Anna Moffo, Judith Blegen and Frank Guarrera) at the Curtis Institute. The outbreak of World War I had made it impossible for the diva to return to her beloved Alps during the summers. Sembrich turned instead to the Adirondack Mountains area and spent summers at Lake Placid from 1915 to 1921, and then at a home on Lake George from 1922 to 1934. The Marcella Sembrich Opera Museum can be found at Bolton Landing, New York. The museum contains many mementos from the diva's career.  Death  Sembrich died on January 11, 1935 at her home, 151 Central Park West in Manhattan, New York City.  Reception  Since her debut with the Met in 1883, Sembrich has received praise from all who hear her. The New York Truth called Sembrich \\"an artist of the foremost rank among the living\\" The New York Journal dubbed her \\"queen of the opera season so far. Her Lucia is a marvel of voice, execution and magnetism. [She] sings deliciously. There seemed to be no limit to her vocalization: notes run out like pearls falling into a casket with infinite richness, and apparently no effort.\\" Until her retirement at the end of the 1908-09 season, Sembrich captivated audience after audience. Her farewell gala and performance, one of the most lavish farewells in Met history, sold out within two hours of going on sale. At the gala, Sembrich's first entrance was met with a standing ovation lasting several minutes. = The Victor Recordings = Recorded in 1908-1919, the Victor Recordings feature Sembrich's renditions of arias from Rigoletto, Lucia di Lammermoor, Semiramide, Linda di Chamounix, I Vespri Siciliani, The Merry Widow, Ernani, La Traviata and Waltz Dream. James Camner, in his review of the album in Opera News, notes that Marcella was \\"past her prime\\" when recording technology came to popularity, but she was still one of the first of her time to produce full length albums. But more important, according to ARSC Journal, is the access to her recordings. Richard LeSueur, reviewer for ARSC Journal, states that her recordings may have been controversial at the time, but it provides a broader picture of her art. Legacy Following her passing, the New York Times and The Musical Times gave Sembrich obituaries that highlighted her time in the spotlight of the opera world. Fans across the world mourned her death and the loss of one of the great artists of the time; The New York Times states \\"her death removes one of the last remaining artists from the rapidly thinning ranks of those who form a link with the great traditions of the past. Fortunate are those who remember her in her days of artistic affluence.\\" Off stage, she was a dedicated teacher and philanthropist, highlighted below: *Over the summers Sembrich would retreat to her studio on Lake George in Bolton Landing, New York. She would house and host her students for the summer while they continues their studies with her. Today the studio serves as The Marcella Sembrich Opera Museum and contains many mementos from the diva's life. *She made a substantial impression on both her teachers and students. Her former teacher Lamperti, dedicated his book about the art of singing to her. *She was a great Polish patriot and humanitarian throughout her life. During World War One she was President of the American-Polish Relief Committee of New York. She was wholly devoted to raising money, food stuffs and clothes for her suffering countrymen. The Kosciuszko Foundation, Inc., an American center for Polish culture in New York City, annually holds the \\"Marcella Sembrich Voice Competition\\". The competition is open to singers up to the age of 35 who are not under professional management. The American Council for Polish Culture [ACPC] also honors Sembrich with an annual vocal competition for singers of Polish descent, the \\"ACPC Marcella Kocha≈Ñska Sembrich Vocal Competition\\". She also had organized concerts and activities to raise money for victim of the San Francisco earthquake. *Two portraits of Sembrich, one in costume, were painted in 1899 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862‚Äì1947) but are now lost. Her 1936 portrait by Alice Ruggles Sohier (1880‚Äì1969) now hangs in the Metropolitan Opera House (and can be found near the coat room). She also made a number of acoustic recordings prior to World War 1 for both Columbia Records (1903) and the Victor Talking Machine Company. Although these fail to do justice to her voice and undoubted artistry, they have been reissued on CD and repay careful listening. *The Sembrich in Bolton Landing has Announced 2020's Summer Festical, titled \\"20/20 Musical Visionaries\\" . The festival will feature a Tribute to Marcella Sembrich.

Born in St. John's, Newfoundland, Bond was the eldest son of Elizabeth Parsons and John Bond. The elder Bond, a native of Kingskerswell, Devon, was born in 1804 and migrated to St. John's in the 1820s. George was brother to Sir Robert Bond, Newfoundland's premier from 1900 to 1909. Educated at the General Protestant Academy, Bond was accepted as a candidate for the Methodist ministry in 1871. From there he entered into studies at Mount Allison Methodist College in Sackville, New Brunswick. His first assignment after graduation was to Gower Street Methodist Church in St. John's as an assistant minister. Bond was ordained into the Methodist ministry at George Street Methodist Church on June 26, 1876. Bond spent the next 14 years in service at many of the outlying communities of Newfoundland before taking up his last posting at Grand Bank in 1890. During his first 20 years in the ministry, Bond was actively involved in the governance of the Methodist Church in Newfoundland, serving on numerous boards and committees at various levels. In both 1885 and 1889, he filled the post of President of Conference. Due to illness and death of family members in a time when many fell victim to the typhoid epidemic that brought hundreds of young lives to an early end, Bond spent a little more than a year in Grand Bank before deciding to transfer to the Nova Scotia Conference of the Methodist Church. In 1895, Bond accepted the editorship of The Wesleyan, the official organ of the Nova Scotia Conference, based in Halifax. He held that position until 1902 when he relocated to Toronto to become editor of the Christian Guardian, which had been founded by Methodists there as their weekly newspaper in 1829. After the death of his beloved wife Lucy Amelia (Macpherson) Bond was moved to take up missionary work Japan and China. He travelled up the Yangtze River as far as Sichuan, where he visited with fellow missionaries and acquired an ample supply of photographs and information from which he developed an illustrated lecture series. His Oriental excursion complete, he returned to Nova Scotia, where he served in a number of churches of the next seven years, and in 1911 was elected President of the Nova Scotia Conference. Bond was invited back to St. John's in 1916 by the congregation of Cochrane Street Church and served there for five years, during which time he served a third term as President of the Newfoundland Conference in 1919. Before Bond left Cochrane Street in 1921, he attended the worldwide Ecumenical Conference in London, England, as a representative from Newfoundland. In addition to his clerical work, Bond was an accomplished writer of fiction. In 1887, he published a novel, Skipper George Netman, the story of Newfoundland fishermen and their lives in the fictional outport of Caplin Bight. He wrote a short story, The Castaway of Fish Rock plus other stories of non-fiction essays on the Church's missionary work. Bond's oldest son, Herbert, was chosen as Newfoundland's second Rhodes Scholar in 1905. He was drowned on a surveying expedition in British Columbia in 1910.

Written by John Enbom and directed by John T. Kretchmer, the episode premiered on UPN on February 1, 2006. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Wallace (Percy Daggs III) tells a newspaper that his talented teammate, Rashard Rucker (B.J. Britt) was involved in a hit and run, and Veronica is called in to help. Meanwhile, Weevil (Francis Capra) and Logan (Jason Dohring) continue to work on the mystery of Felix Toombs's murder, eventually leading to a mutiny against Weevil.  Synopsis  Veronica talks to Wallace at Java the Hut. Wallace is going to turn Rashard Rucker in for a hit-and-run. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) distracts Inga in order to break into the police station evidence room. The next day, Wallace has unexpectedly had no backlash from snitching on Rashard. Weevil talks to Molly Fitzpatrick, who admits to dating Felix but insists that he wasn‚Äôt working for the Fitzpatricks. Nathan Woods (Cress Williams) contacts Wallace to say that the newspaper says that Rashard came forward and told the press that Wallace was driving during the hit-and- run, indicating that the journalist from the last episode was not what he said he was. Veronica discusses the fallout with Wallace before Jackie (Tessa Thompson) comes up, and Wallace is dismissive. Veronica contacts Cliff (Daran Norris), who advocates for Wallace. In order to get Wallace to see Rashard, they decide to go to a dinner at UCLA, which Rashard will be attending. Veronica informs Keith about Terrence Cook‚Äôs gambling problem. Weevil talks to Logan about a church at which one of the Fitzpatricks is a priest. As Weevil is leaving, another PCH biker sees him. Veronica picks up Rashard in a fake limousine, and Rashard‚Äôs uncle warns him about these sorts of situations. When they pull up to Wallace, Rashard‚Äôs uncle threatens Wallace and the limo driver. Later, Wallace remembers that a drive-through person saw Rashard at the wheel that night. At Java the Hut, Weevil and Logan ask Veronica to bug the confessional at the church. Veronica says she‚Äôll bug video, but not sound. Keith listens to bus crash interrogation tapes. Referencing the dead rat on the bus, Keith offers that Veronica was not the target of the bus crash. Wallace fails to track down the drive-through guy, who has disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Veronica bugs the confessional before being questioned by Father Fitzpatrick. Wallace goes to a fraternity party and talks to Rashard, who threatens him abrasively. On his way out, Wallace sees Jackie talking to Rashard. In retaliation, Rashard gets some of his cronies to lock Wallace in a closet. Veronica waits in the car anxiously and sees Jackie driving off with Rashard. After getting out of the closet, Wallace finds Rashard‚Äôs uncle, who didn‚Äôt know that Rashard left. Wallace directs the uncle to a club, which Veronica sneaks into and steals the uncle‚Äôs phone. Veronica watches the confessional tape and finds that Thumper snuck drugs out of the confessional. It turns out that Wallace and Veronica were actually using Jackie to catch Rashard off guard. That day, a girl walks up to Wallace and asks if their date is still on, which he accepts. Weevil confronts the bikers, and they were actually all working for the Fitzpatricks. Thumper reveals that Weevil was in cahoots with Logan, and the bikers mutiny against him, beat him up, and leave him. Nathan Woods goes to the home of the drive-through guy, Guy Abrutti, and confronts him about accepting money for his silence. Wallace has successfully subverted Rashard and his uncle. Keith listens to more tapes, and they learn from the news that Sheriff Lamb has taken Terrence Cook in for questioning related to the bus crash.  Cultural references  The following cultural references are made in the episode: *Veronica compares Rashard to LeBron James. *Keith is reading Those Who Trespass and listening to a Bad Company album. *Veronica references Steve McQueen. *Veronica jokingly mentions A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.  Arc significance  *Keith steals the interrogation tapes from the bus crash investigation. *Dick and Cassidy reveal to Sheriff Lamb that their father knew \\"Curly\\" Moran as a mechanic. Dick also tells him that the bus smelled bad, which was why he got a limo. *Gia Goodman tells Lamb that her father, Woody, told her not to ride the bus. *Keith speculates to Veronica that the dead rat was there so that the 09ers wouldn't go back on the bus, thus the only casualties would be lower- and middle-class students. Veronica still thinks it was targeted to her. *Veronica bugs the confessional at Father Fitzpatrick's church and shows the video to Weevil. It shows Thumper, one of the PCHers, taking drugs that Liam Fitzpatrick left behind. *Weevil confronts Thumper, but Thumper has organized a coup against Weevil‚ÄîHector's brother works at the Neptune Grand and saw Weevil come out of Logan's room. The PCHers beat up Weevil and Thumper tells Hector to throw Weevil's motorcycle into the ocean. *Veronica finds a picture of Terrence Cook and Ms. Dumas (the late journalism teacher) together. *Lamb questions Terrence Cook in relation to the bus crash.  Music  The following songs can be heard in the episode: *\\"All Out of Love\\" by Air Supply *\\"Veronica\\" by Elvis Costello (sung by Britt Daniel of Spoon) *\\"Shine More\\" by Namie Amuro *\\"See The Sun\\" by Scavone *\\"Jump Around\\" by House of Pain *\\"I Summon You\\" by Spoon  Production  Britt Daniel, lead singer of Spoon, made a cameo appearance in the episode. The episode was written by John Enbom and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Enbom's seventh writing credit and Kretchmer's seventh directing credit. Teddy Dunn continues to be credited, despite his final regular appearance in \\"Donut Run\\".

Reception = Ratings = In its original broadcast, the episode received 2.12 million viewers, marking an increase in 500,000 viewers from the previous episode. = Reviews = Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club gave a mostly positive review. While criticizing Jackie's role in the episode (\\"Jackie is still a problematic character, and suddenly having her be part of the crew, without any apologies, is a bit too far.\\"), he lauded all other aspects of the episode, including the plot and character development of Weevil, Logan, and other. He also praised the technical aspects of the episode. \\"I thought this episode had a lot of the technical verve which had been missing from the second season. [‚Ä¶] There were three scenes that seemed to add a little something extra with the directing and editing.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B+\\". Conversely, Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a more mixed review. He praised it as \\"a solid effort\\" while criticizing the B-plot involving Weevil and Logan. \\"You know, I'm not totally riveted by the Felix murder plot line. I'm just not. It's nowhere near as exciting as the bus-crash case, so I found myself getting kind of bored or impatient every time we curt back to Weevil's shenanigans.\\"  References  External links  \\"Rashard and Wallace Go to White Castle\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2006 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 2) episodes ","title":"Rashard and Wallace Go to White Castle"},{"id":"3939680","text":"The New Guinean spiny bandicoots (genus Echymipera) are members of the order Peramelemorphia.

Family and education Dasgupta was born in Kushtia, Bengal (now in Bangladesh) in a Vaidya family. His ancestral home was in the village Goila in Barisal District. He studied at Ripon College in Calcutta, and graduated with honours in Sanskrit. Later, in 1908, he received his master's degree from Sanskrit College, Calcutta. He got a second master's degree in Western philosophy in 1910 from the University of Calcutta. Prof. Dasgupta married Himani Devi, a beautiful lady and the younger sister of India's pioneer film director and founder of Bombay Talkies Himanshu Rai and had six children with her. Dasgupta had three daughters Maitreyi Devi (Sen) (1914-1989), Chitrita Devi (Gupta) and Sumitra Majumdar. Maitreyi Devi and Chitrita Devi (Gupta) were also famous writers. His sons Subhayu Dasgupta, Sugata Dasgupta and Prof. Subhachari Dasgupta also left behind valuable works in nation building. His last surviving and youngest child Sumitra Majumdar died in Goa in September 2008. Dasgupta had taken the Griffith Prize in 1916 and his doctorate in Indian philosophy in 1920. Maharaja Sir Manindra Chandra Nandi now urged him to go to Europe to study European philosophy at its sources, and generously bore all the expenses of his research tour (1920‚Äì22). Dasgupta went to England and distinguished himself at Cambridge as a research student in philosophy under Dr. J. M. E. McTaggart. During this time the Cambridge University Press published the first volume of the History of Indian Philosophy (1921). He was also appointed lecturer at Cambridge, and nominated to represent Cambridge University at the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris. His participation in the debates of the Aristotelian Society, London, the leading philosophical society of England, and of the Moral Science Club, Cambridge, earned for him the reputation of being an almost invincible controversialist. Great teachers of philosophy like Ward and McTaggart, under whom he studied, looked upon him not as their pupil but as their colleague. He received his Cambridge doctorate for an elaborate thesis on contemporary European philosophy. The impressions that he had made by his speeches and in the debates at the Paris Congress secured for him an invitation to the International Congress at Naples in 1924, where he was sent as a representative of the Bengal Education Department and of the University of Calcutta ; later on, he was sent on deputation by the Government of Bengal to the International Congress at Harvard in 1926. In that connection he delivered the Harris Foundation lectures at Chicago, besides a series of lectures at about a dozen other Universities of the United States and at Vienna, where he was presented with an illuminated address and a bronze bust of himself. He was invited in 1925 to the second centenary of the Academy of Science, Leningrad, but he could not attend for lack of Government sanction. In 1935, 1936 and 1939 he was invited as visiting professor to Rome, Milan, Breslau, Konigsberg, Berlin, Bonn, Cologne, Zurich, Paris, Warsaw and England. Career His career in teaching began with a short stint as a lecturer in Rajshahi College. Later, he became a Professor of Sanskrit and Bengali in Chittagong College. After some time, he went back to graduate school and received a PhD from the University of Calcutta, and later went to England to work on his second PhD at the University of Cambridge. Following his return in 1924, Dasgupta joined the Presidency College as Professor of Philosophy. Later, he became the principal of Sanskrit College, and later joined the University of Calcutta as a professor. In 1932, he served as president of the Indian Philosophical Congress. His own philosophy was known as Theory of Dependent Emergence. The list of his famous students includes scholars like Mircea Eliade and Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya. About 1941 or 1942 Dasgupta moved away from his wife Himani Madhuri Dasgupta and their six children, and he stayed with SuramƒÅ Mitra (1907 - 12 June 1998), his secretary and student, whom he married in 1945. SuramƒÅ Mitra held a PhD in philosophy, taught at Lucknow University, and authored a few books on philosophy. Dasgupta's relationship with SuramƒÅ Mitra caused enormous pain to his near ones and was strongly disputed by Dasgupta's family. Whilst SuramƒÅ Mitra claimed to be Dasgupta's wife, such claims were unjustifiable and illegal as Surendranath and Himani were never legally divorced and bigamy was a crime in British and Independent India. The University of Warsaw made him an honorary Fellow of the Academy of Sciences. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. The Societe des Amis du Monde of Paris offered him a special reception, and M. Renou, Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Paris, wrote to him afterwards: \\" While you were amongst us, we felt as if a Sankara or a Patanjali was born again and moved amongst us.\\" Kind and simple and gentle as he was, Dasgupta was always undaunted in challenging scholars and philosophers. In the second International Congress of Philosophy in Naples, the thesis of Dasgupta's paper was that the philosophy of Benedetto Croce (1866-1952) had been largely anticipated by Dharmakirtti and Dharmottara, and that where Croce differed, he (Croce) was himself in error. On account of internal differences Croce had no mind to join the Congress, but the fact that Dasgupta was going to challenge his philosophy and prove it to be second-hand in open congress, induced him to do so. In the same way he challenged Louis de La Vall√©e-Poussin, the great Buddhist scholar, before a little assembly presided over by J. M. E. McTaggart. In the meetings of the Aristotelian Society Dasgupta was a terror to his opponents, his method of approach being always to point out their errors. He inflicted this treatment on many other scholars, particularly Fyodor Shcherbatskoy (Stcherbatsky) (1866-1942) and Sylvain L√©vi (1863-1935). A History of Indian Philosophy When Lord Ronaldshay, the Governor of Bengal, came to visit Chittagong College, he had a long talk with Professor Dasgupta in his classroom, and was so much impressed by it that he expressed the desire that the first volume of the History of Indian Philosophy might be dedicated to him. Originally Dasgupta's plan was to write out the history of Indian systems of thought in one volume. Therefore, he tried to condense the materials available within the compass of one book. But as he went on collecting materials from all parts of India, a huge mass of published and unpublished texts came to light, and the plan of the work enlarged more and more as he tried to utilise them. This was the first and only attempt to write out in a systematic manner a history of Indian thought directly from the original sources in Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit. In a work of the fourteenth century A.D., the Sarva-darsana-samgraha of Madhavacarya, we find a minor attempt to give a survey of the different philosophical schools of India. But the account given there is very brief, and the work does not give an exhaustive survey of all the different systems of philosophy. In the present series the author traced, in a historical and critical manner, the development of Indian thought in its different branches from various sources, a considerable portion of which lies in unpublished manuscripts. He spared no pains and underwent a tremendous amount of drudgery in order to unearth the sacred, buried treasures of Indian thought. He revised his original plan of writing only one volume and thought of completing the task in five consecutive volumes constituting a series. He shouldered this gigantic task all alone, with the sincerest devotion and unparalleled enthusiasm and zeal. In 1942 he retired from Sanskrit College and was appointed King George V Professor of Mental and Moral Science in the University of Calcutta. He worked there for three years and delivered the Stephanos Nirmalendu lectures on the history of religions. He had been suffering from heart trouble since 1940, but was still carrying on his various activities and research work. In 1945 he retired from the Calcutta University and was offered the Professorship of Sanskrit at Edinburgh which had fallen vacant after the death of Professor Keith. The doctors also advised a trip to England. On his arrival in England he fell ill again. In November 1945 he delivered his last public lecture on Hinduism in Trinity College, Cambridge. Since then he was confined to bed with acute heart trouble. In spite of his ill health while in England, he was in constant touch with his close students.Dr.S.N.Dasgupta's personal letter dated 2 August 1948 from Trinity College, Cambridge, addressed to Katyayanidas Bhattacharya, published in \\"Duti Patra, Duti Charitra-prasanga : Surendranath O Katyayanidas\\" - an article (in Bengali) by Amitabha Bhattacharya at Dainik Statesman on 16 December 2018 (Page 3 of the Sunday Supplement - Bichitra) (http://epaper.thestatesman.com/m5/1935715/Bichitra/16th- DECEMBER-2018#dual/4/1) He stayed in England for five years (1945‚Äì50). Even then he published the fourth volume of his History of Indian Philosophy at the Cambridge University Press, the History of Sanskrit Literature at Calcutta University, Rabindranath the Poet and Philosopher with his Calcutta publishers, and a book on aesthetics in Bengali. In 1950 he returned to Lucknow. In 1951, through friendly help given by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, he started writing the fifth and final volume of the Historyof Indian Philosophy. He had also planned to write out his own system of philosophy in two volumes. His friends and students requested him several times to complete the writing of his own first. Yet he looked upon his work on Indian philosophy as the sacred mission of his life, and thought himself to be committed to that purpose. With strong determination and unwavering devotion he brought his life's mission very near its completion. Until the end of his life he was working for this, and completed one full section just a few hours before his passing away, on 18 December 1952. Even on this last day of his life, he worked in the morning and afternoon on the last chapter of the section of Southern Saivism. He died peacefully at eight in the evening while discussing problems of modern psychology.

It was closed after being replaced by a permanent station, Izmaylovsky Park (now Izmaylovskaya). Pervomaskaya was located in the Izmaylovo depot, which was built in 1950. Out of necessity the depot had been built east of Izmaylovskaya (now Partizanskaya), since this was the only shallow-level station on the line. However, because of the dense residential area and natural parkland surrounding Partizanskaya, the depot had to be built at a significant distance from the station, about 1.5 km away in the Izmailovo residential district. For this reason, it was decided to establish a temporary station within the depot itself until a permanent station, which was planned for the early 1960s, was completed. The new station opened on 24 September 1954, becoming the first ground level station on the Moscow Metro. It was also, to date, the only station with a wooden roof. On 21 October 1961, Izmaylovskaya opened half a kilometre to the east of Pervomayskaya and the temporary station was closed. The station is still in relatively good condition, with its tiled walls and decorative reliefs intact. It has long suggested that Pervomayskaya be renovated and turned into a museum of Metro rolling stock, since some preserved examples are already stored at the depot. However, the depot's repair facilities are still active so any plans for a museum would have to wait until the completion of a new depot at the west end of the line, which would not take place before 2015. Former vestubule entrance (2002) Pervomayskaya's former vestibule is located near the intersection of Pervomayskaya and 1st Parkovaya streets. This building remains in good condition and is used for official ceremonies by the depot workers and their families.

Early life and education  He was born in La Porte, Indiana, on February 12, 1873. He attended the public schools and the Lawrenceville School. He graduated from Princeton College in 1893, studied at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1893 to 1898, graduating with a master's degree in 1895 and a doctorate in 1900. He later pursued postgraduate studies in the Universities of Halle, Berlin, and Paris. Early career in economics  He moved to Gloucester, Massachusetts, and was instructor and assistant professor of economics at Harvard University from 1900 to 1909. In January 1907, Andrew published a paper that anticipated the economic panic that hit in the fall of that year. On the strength of this paper as well as on his strong economics education, Andrew was selected to serve on the National Monetary Commission tasked with reforming the American banking system. Andrew took a leave from Harvard and spent two years studying the central banks of Germany, Britain and France. He served as Director of the U.S. Mint in 1909 and 1910, and as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during 1910‚Äì1912. He attended the historic meeting at Jekyll Island in 1910 with commission chairman Nelson W. Aldrich, Henry P. Davison, Benjamin Strong, Paul Warburg, and Frank A. Vanderlip. The commission's report recommended the creation of a Federal Reserve System. The Republicans lost the White House in 1912, putting Andrew out of a job. He worked informally after the election with Democratic Senator Robert Latham Owen to draft Owen's version of a Federal Reserve Bill, which in the event came closest of several competing drafts to the Act eventually passed and signed into law in December 1913.Lowenstein, Roger. America's Bank (New York, Penguin, 2015). Founder of American Field Service Bain News Service/LOC ggbain.23095. Grenville Keogh, Anne Harriman Vanderbilt, Anne Morgan, Piatt Andrew, 1916 (Grenville Keogh was an ambulance driver for the American Ambulance Field Service) Despite American neutrality, Andrew went to France when war broke out in the summer of 1914. He wrote to his parents about his compulsion to respond to \\"the possibility of having even an infinitesimal part in one of the greatest events in all history...and above all the chance of doing the little all that one can for France.\\" Andrew drove an ambulance in the Dunkirk sector for a few weeks, but his supervisor at the American Military Hospital recognized his exceptional energy and organizing ability. Robert Bacon created a new position for him to fill: Inspector General of the American Ambulance Field Service. In his official capacity, Andrew toured the ambulance sections of Northern France and learned that the American volunteers were bored with so called \\"jitney work,\\" transporting wounded soldiers from railheads to hospitals, far back from the front lines. French army policy prohibited foreign nationals from traveling into battle zones. In March 1915, Andrew met with Captain Aime Doumenc, head of the French Army Automobile Service and pleaded his case for the American volunteers. They desired above all, he said, \\"To pick up the wounded from the front lines‚Ä¶, to look danger squarely in the face; in a word, to mingle with the soldiers of France and to share their fate!\\" Doumenc agreed to a trial. The success of Andrew's Section Z was immediate and overwhelming. By April 15, 1915, the French created American Ambulance Field Service operating under French Army command. Lt. Col. A. Piatt Andrew Jr. Andrew headed the organization, soon shortened to American Field Service, throughout the war, though his role changed significantly when its ambulance sections were taken over by the United States Army in late summer 1917. Andrew established a domestic organization based in Boston to recruit young American drivers and to raise funds from wealthy donors. The stateside office was headed by Henry Davis Sleeper and assisted by Henry Hays Hammond and former ambulance driver, Leslie Buswell. The French office was located at number 21 rue Raynouard, Paris. At the time of militarization, the American Field Service had formed thirty-four ambulance sections manned by 1,200 American volunteers. (A total of 2,100 volunteers had volunteered over the course of two years.) In addition the AFS had created fourteen camion sections with 800 additional American volunteers trucking supplies and soldiers up the Voie Sacree from Bar-le-Duc to Verdun and other routes to the Front.History of the American Field Service in France, as told by its members, vol. 3, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1920, pp. 429-434; and Hansen, p. 54 The AFS motto was \\"Tous et tout pour France,\\" everyone and everything for France. At an AFS reunion a few years after the war, Andrew said, \\"The opportunity of living in France, as we Americans lived during the first years of the war...meant glimpses of human nature shorn of self, exalted by love of country, singing and jesting in the midst of hardships, smiling at pain, unmindful even of death.\\" History of the American Field Service, vol. 1, p. 15 Congressman Andrew was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-seventh United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Willfred W. Lufkin; he was reelected to the Sixty-eighth and to the six succeeding Congresses and served from September 27, 1921, until his death. He was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1924 and 1928. In 1924, he proposed a bonus for World War I veterans. He was a member of the board of trustees of Princeton University from 1932 to 1936. Awards  He was made an officer in the Legion of Honor in 1927. He received the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his World War I service.http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=17195 He was named an Officer in Belgium's Order of Leopold. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre and named a Chevalier de la Legion of Honour in 1917 by the French government. Personal life Some sources state that Andrew, a lifelong bachelor, was in a relationship with his neighbor, interior designer Henry Davis Sleeper. Others state that the two were just friends.

The following day the United States House of Representatives adjourned at 2:55 p.m. to honor his death. His remains were cremated and the ashes scattered from an airplane flying over his estate on Eastern Point in Gloucester. In 1953, a bridge carrying Massachusetts Route 128 over the Annisquam River to the island section of Gloucester was named the \\"A. Piatt Andrew Bridge\\" in honor of his service as a congressman.

The NJCP received the endorsement of United We Stand America, H. Ross Perot's citizen action organization in 1995. In 1995, the party ran approximately 60 candidates for the New Jersey General Assembly, none of whom won. the party broke the record for the most third party candidates during one election in the history of New Jersey. This helped lead the NJCP to receiving 117,219 votes. However, in order to earn official third- party status from the state, the party was required to bring in at least 10% of the total vote; a number it did not meet. The party considered changing its name in support of Perot's presidential candidacy. In 1997, the Conservative Party and other members of the Council of Alternative Political Parties filed suit against the state regarding filing deadlines and the number of signatures needed to do so.http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/975398.txt The party ran candidates in every district in New Jersey in the midterm 1998 United States House of Representatives elections.https://www.njelections.org/election- results/1998-gen-elect-candidates-us-house.pdf In 1999, New Jersey Conservative Party and three of its individual members who were candidates for elective office filed a certified complaint to enjoin county clerks, from drawing separate political party columns for the Democratic and Republican parties on the official ballot. The party also brought an appeal to the Supreme Court of New Jersey regarding preferential ballot positions for the Republican and Democratic parties compared to the NJCP. Historically, the Republican and Democratic candidates were given top spots on the ballot, and the NJCP argued that low voter turn-out led to these parties not even receiving the 10% vote minimum (out of all registered voters for that cycle) to proceed to the general vote. However, the court ruled to reject the application. In 2000, the New Jersey Conservative Party was involved in a lawsuit that permitted New Jersey voters to join third parties. Until 2001 New Jersey did not allow registering to vote as anything other than Democrat, Republican, or Independent. This was ruled unconstitutional in 2001 after a lawsuit was brought by a coalition of political parties, including the NJCP. In 2009 the State Chairman Stephen Spinosa asked registered members to change their party affiliation to Republican so they could vote for Steve Lonegan for Governor. (Spinosa had run for office as NJCP candidate, twice for State and once for Congress between 1997 and 1999). By doing so he effectively called for the suspension, though not dissolution, of his third-party movement in order to boost Lonegan's chances. On February 19, 2010, the New Jersey Conservative Party signed an affiliation agreement with the national Conservative Party USA. By February 20, the New Jersey affiliate turned over their party membership to the national party for management in accordance with the affiliation agreement. Dr. Steven Maness (who had run as Conservative Party candidate for Middlesex County Freeholder in 1998) assumed New Jersey party leadership on December 30. In January 2019, Martin Marks, former mayor of Scotch Plains, announced his independent candidacy for the New Jersey's 21st Legislative District, under the banner of \\"Conservative\\" in the 2019 New Jersey elections.

He served in the North Dakota House of Representatives from 1915 to 1923, and became the 14th Lieutenant Governor of North Dakota in 1925. Maddock became the 15th Governor of North Dakota in 1928 when Arthur G. Sorlie died in office, and became the first governor born in what would eventually become North Dakota. He was born in Grand Forks, Dakota Territory. He received his education at Northwestern Business College in Grand Forks, North Dakota. He was married on October 30, 1906, to Margarite Tierney and they had five children, Wallace, Jerome, Dore R. V., Bernard, and Margarite. Career Maddock's first involvement with politics was as one of the founders of the Nonpartisan League. He was a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives from 1915 through 1923. Maddock became the Lieutenant Governor in 1925 and upon the death of Governor Sorlie, he assumed the governorship in 1928. He served the remainder of Sorlie's term and sought re- election, but he failed to win the race against George F. Shafer. In the 1928 election, he did something rare when he switched parties from Republican to Democratic. After being defeated in the election, Maddock returned to farming and was active in organizing farmers' cooperatives.

The stadium was built specifically to host Super Eight matches in the 2007 Cricket World Cup held in March and April 2007. The stadium hosted six World Cup matches between March 28, 2007 and April 9, 2007, most notably the match between Sri Lanka and South Africa in which Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga became the first bowler in international cricket history to take four wickets in four consecutive balls. Built primarily for cricket matches, the stadium can be converted into a multi-use facility. Ground level looking out over the Pitch History Built for the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, the stadium hosted six One Day Internationals as part of that competition, all at the Super Eights stage. As of June 2016, it has hosted ten more ODI games since the 2007 World Cup including a historic three Day/Night matches during the 2016 Tri Series involving West Indies, Australia and South Africa. This series represents the first time that every ODI match is played under floodlights in the Caribbean. Providence hosted its first Test Match in 2008, with Sri Lanka as the visiting team, but didn't host another Test until May 2011, when the West Indies defeated Pakistan. It was also one of the venues for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, hosting six group stage matches, including 2 matches involving the West Indies. It has also hosted other sports other than cricket including football and also hosted the rugby sevens competition at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games. The opening and closing ceremonies as well as the numerous super concerts held for Carifesta10 were also hosted there. With the advent of the Caribbean Premier League the stadium became the home ground for the Guyana Amazon Warriors franchise hosting league matches in each of the first three seasons. The stadium was built by the Government of Guyana with substantial financial assistance from the Government of India. It was designed by R.K. & Associates (Ram Kishan and Associates - Architects, Engineers, Planners) and constructed by Shapoorji Pallonji Group. Flooding in 2005 slowed site preparation, and delayed the start of construction, which began in May 2005. Construction costs are estimated at $25,000,000 US. Seating 15,000 people, Providence Stadium is one of the largest sports arenas in Guyana, and now hosts test cricket instead of Bourda. The complex includes a shopping mall and luxury apartments. Princess International Hotel is located next to the stadium. Transport Providence Stadium is located on the east bank of the Demerara River a few kilometres south of the Guyanese capital, Georgetown.

Originally known as Fay's House, it is marked now by a granite and copper statue placed in 1896. It was built 1769 and burned in 1871. During the tavern's 102 years of existence, it was the site of many important events in Vermont's colonial and revolutionary history. It was, for instance, the site of the public hanging of New York grantee and member of the Queen's Rangers, David Redding. Arrested for horse-theft, he managed to escape while being transported to Albany, New York. But he was re- arrested very soon and taken to Bennington, where, after a trial in the tavern, he was sentenced to be hanged in a field adjacent to the tavern. A local merchant, John Burnham, delayed the execution by pointing out that Redding had been tried by six rather than twelve men. Colonel Ethan Allen advised the crowd depart to return the day fixed for the execution in the act of the governor and council, adding with an oath, and according to Dr. John Spargo who wrote a book on the hanging which can be found in the Bennington Museum library, \\"you shall see somebody hung, for if Redding is not hung, I will be hung myself.\\" Upon this assurance, the uproar ceased and the crowd dispersed. Redding was sentenced to hang on June 11, 1778 and his bones, after many years of being used for research and being kept in a drawer, were laid to rest 200 years later in the Old First Church Cemetery. Catamount statue The name Catamount Tavern came about when Grantees from New Hampshire posted a stuffed catamount on the tavern's signpost to repel the New Yorkers who claimed their land. The Catamount served as headquarters for the Green Mountain Boys while making their plans against the New Yorkers and the British. Ethan Allen planned the capture of Fort Ticonderoga here; John Stark planned British General Burgoyne's defeat here, eventually leading to the Battle of Bennington. The Catamount was also the meeting place of Vermont's only form of government then, in 1775, the Vermont Council of Safety.  Notes Bibliography *(1892).

The temple is located in the city of Boise, Idaho. History LDS Church leaders discussed building a temple in the western part of Idaho as early as 1939. However, with the majority of church's membership in the eastern part of Idaho, the leaders decided against it and concentrated on building the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple. Forty-five years later, on March 31, 1982, church leaders announced that a temple would be built in the Boise area. The temple site is located near an exit from Interstate 84 and is very visible to those traveling along the highway and is also a visible landmark for pilots at Boise Airport. In 1984, 70,000 visitors were expected to tour the temple during the nineteen-day open house. Instead, over 128,000 attended. The open house brought an increased interest in the church. The Boise Idaho Temple was dedicated May 25, 1984 by Gordon B. Hinckley. After the dedication, attendance at the temple was much higher than expected. As a result, in October 1986, the temple was closed for renovation. After reopening in 1987, the temple was able to serve more than 100,000 members in southwestern Idaho and part of eastern Oregon. The Boise Idaho Temple has a total of , four ordinance rooms, and four sealing rooms. It was built with a sloping roof & six-spire design. In 2020, the Boise Idaho Temple was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.Stack, Peggy Fletcher. \\"All Latter-day Saint temples to close due to coronavirus\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, 26 March 2020.

The plot revolves around a crumbling marriage and its impact on many other people, especially Laura Wing, the sister of the soon-to-be- divorced wife. Laura is a classic Jamesian \\"central consciousness,\\" whose reflections and emotions color the presentation of the storyline and the other characters. The tale is notable for its straightforward, even hard-edged approach to sexuality and divorce. This might reflect the influence of French naturalism on James during the 1880s. Plot summary Laura Wing, an impoverished American girl, is visiting her sister Selina Berrington in London. Selina's husband Lionel, boorish and often drunk, is preparing to divorce his wife for her adultery with Charlie Crispin. Laura challenges Selina about her affair and doubts Selina's protestations of innocence. Lady Davenant, an elderly friend of the family, counsels Laura not to take her sister's marital troubles so hard. Laura meets a pleasant but boring American named Wendover, who becomes a suitor. Eventually, after a tempestuous and (for the reader) entertaining scene at the opera, Selina leaves her husband and goes to Brussels with Crispin. Laura spurns Wendover's marriage proposal and pursues her sister to Brussels, where she accomplishes nothing. Laura finally goes back to America, where Wendover follows her though there is no assurance as to how their future will play out. The story ends with a reminder that the case of Berrington v. Berrington and others is upcoming in the courts. Key themes The rather Victorian adjective \\"unpleasant\\" has been applied to this story, much as it was long ago used for the products of √âmile Zola and other French naturalists. James certainly tells his story in a blunt fashion, with no illusions about the delicacy or virtue of the Berringtons. The reader can sympathise with neither the oafish husband nor the sluttish wife. Even Laura Wing, the Jamesian central intelligence, is presented as extreme in her horrified reaction to the breakup of this distasteful couple. Lady Davenant tries to supply a much needed dose of common sense to Laura when she advises that Selina and Lionel aren't worth the bother. The atmosphere of the story is similar to the corrupt and irresponsible milieu of What Maisie Knew, and Laura simply can't abide the inevitable sleaziness of, well, a London life. She proves completely ineffective in her attempts to save a marriage not worth saving, and her eventual flight to America is a sad admission of defeat. Although several of the characters are American, James makes nothing of the international contrast. Many critics have wondered why James bothered with such an odd echo of his international theme, when all the characters could easily have been English without affecting the story in any way. Critical evaluation Edmund Wilson liked this story for its no-nonsense approach to the realities of a marital breakup. He classed it as part of what he saw as James's best period, when the novelist \\"reaches what seems to me indisputably his completist artistic maturity: he has got over a certain stiffness, a certain naivete, which characterized his earlier work and he has acquired a new flexibility and a personal idiom.\\" Others have been much less kind. As mentioned above, Robert Gale tagged the story as \\"unpleasant\\" and Edward Wagenknecht found it \\"not technically impressive,\\" with a \\"hurried ending\\" and a \\"rather forced\\" international note. Critics have also divided on Laura Wing, with Leon Edel dismissing her as \\"rigid and meddlesome\\" while Wagenknecht sympathizes with her in strong terms: \\"There is no character in his booksnot even Isabel Archer, not even Fleda Vetchto whom James commits himself more unreservedly than to Laura Wing\\". Such forceful reactions may testify to the power of the story's unembarrassed portrayal of a messy divorce.

After his final arrest, he was tortured to death by prison authorities in the Tower of London. He is honoured as a martyr by the Catholic Church and was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970.Reynolds, Tony. \\"St Nicholas Owen: Priest-Hole Maker\\" Gracewing 2014 Life He was born in Oxford, England, around 1562 into a devoutly-Catholic family and grew up during the Penal Laws. His father, Walter Owen, was a carpenter and Nicholas was apprenticed as a joiner in February 1577 and acquired skills that he would use to build hiding places. Two of his older brothers became priests. Owen served as Edmund Campion's servant and was arrested for protesting Campion's innocence. Upon his release, he entered the service of Henry Garnet, a Jesuit, around 1588. For the next 18 years, Owen built hiding places for priests in the homes of Catholic families. He frequently traveled from one house to another under the name of \\"Little John\\" and accepted only the necessities of life as payment before he started off for a new project.Stagnaro, Angelo. \\"Master Illusionist\\", National Catholic Register He also used the aliases \\"Little Michael\\", \\"Andrewes\\" and \\"Draper\\". During the daytime, he would work as a travelling carpenter to deflect suspicion. Owen was of very short stature, and suffered from a hernia,Hogge, Alice (2005) God's Secret Agents, London: Harper Collins, pp. 118, 364 as well as a crippled leg from a horse falling on him. Nevertheless, his work often involved breaking through thick stonework, and to minimise the likelihood of betrayal, he often worked at night and always alone. Sometimes, he built an easily discovered outer hiding place, which concealed an inner hiding place. The location of the secret room was known to only himself and the owner of the house. Examples of his work survive at Sawston Hall in Cambridgeshire, Oxburgh Hall in Norfolk, Huddington Court in Worcestershire and Coughton Court in Warwickshire. Harvington Hall in Worcestershire has seven \\"priest holes\\". Due to the ingenuity of his craftsmanship, some may still be undiscovered. A priest hole in the staircase made by Nicholas Owen in a 16th-century manor- house, Harvington Hall, Worcestershire. Another priest hole made by Nicholas Owen in the library in Harvington Hall The same priest hole inside. For many years, Owen worked in the service of the Jesuit priest Henry Garnet and was admitted into the Society of Jesus as a lay brother. He was arrested in 1594 and tortured at the Poultry Compter but revealed nothing. He was released after a wealthy Catholic family paid a fine on his behalf, the jailers believing that he was merely the insignificant friend of some priests. He resumed his work and is believed to have masterminded the famous escape of Father John Gerard from the Tower of London in 1597. In early 1606, Owen was arrested a final time at Hindlip Hall in Worcestershire,Lives of the Saints By Alban Butler, Peter Doyle, giving himself up voluntarily in the hope of distracting attention from his master, Father Henry Garnet, who was hiding nearby with another priest. Realising just whom they had caught, and his value, Secretary of State Robert Cecil exulted: \\"It is incredible, how great was the joy caused by his arrest... knowing the great skill of Owen in constructing hiding places, and the innumerable quantity of dark holes which he had schemed for hiding priests all through England\\". Death After being committed to the Marshalsea, a prison on the southern bank of the Thames, Owen was then removed to the Tower of London. He was submitted to torture on the Topcliffe rack, dangling from a wall with both wrists held fast in iron gauntlets and his body hanging. As his hernia allowed his intestines to bulge out during this procedure, the rackmaster strapped a circular plate of iron to his stomach. When he remained stubborn, it is believed that he was transferred to the rack, where the greater power of the windlass forced out his hernia which was then slashed by the plate, resulting in his death. Owen revealed nothing to his inquisitors,Narrative of the Gunpowder Plot, Fr. John Gerard, S.J. and died in the night between 1 and 2 March 1606. Father Gerard wrote of him: Veneration Owen was canonized as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales by Pope Paul VI on 25 October 1970. Their joint feast day was initially celebrated on the anniversary of the canonization. That feast has been moved in England to 4 May. His individual feast day is on 22 March. Catholic stage magicians who practice Gospel Magic consider St. Nicholas Owen the patron saint of illusionists and escapologists, due to his facility at using \\"trompe l'oeil\\" when creating his hideouts and the fact that he masterminded the famous escape of Fr. John Gerard from the Tower of London. There are Roman Catholic churches dedicated to Saint Nicholas Owen in Little Thornton, Lancashire and Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire. The Roman Catholic school academy company that serves the Kidderminster, Hagley and Stourbridge areas near to Harvington Hall is named in his honour. In novels He is portrayed, as a minor character, in Robert Hugh Benson's novel Come Rack! Come Rope! (1912), where he is named \\"Hugh Owen\\". One of his priest holes plays a key role in the Catherine Aird mystery novel A Most Contagious Game (1967).

Craig Owens (1950‚Äì1990) was an American post-modernist art critic,Andy Grundberg, ' ART VIEW; As It Must to All, Death Comes To Post-Modernism', New York Times, September 16, 1990 gay activist and feminist. Biography Craig Owens was a senior editor of Art in America,Grace Glueck, ' ART: 'REPRESENTATION AND SEXUALITY,' MIXED MEDIA SHOW AT NEW MUSEUM', New York Times, January 4, 1985 a contributor to such scholarly journals as Skyline and October, a graduate of Haverford College, and a professor of art history at Yale University and Barnard College. He wrote many essays on such diverse topics as photography, feminism, gay politics, art in the marketplace, serial art, and psychoanalysis, as well as a number of seminal essays on individual contemporary individual artists, including Allan McCollum,\\"Allan McCollum: Repetition and Difference\\", by Craig Owens, Art in America, 1983 William Wegman, and Barbara Kruger. One of Owens's most influential essays was The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism, an article in two parts in which he explores the allegorical aspects of contemporary art. The two parts were published in the journal October in Spring 1980 and Summer 1980. In the first part Owens says that, \\"Allegorical imagery is appropriated imagery\\" (Owens, p54) and discerns an allegorical impulse at work in the appropriation art of artists such as Sherrie Levine. He describes the postmodernist artist as one that \\"lays claim to the culturally significant, poses as its interpreter... If he adds, however, he does so only to replace: the allegorical meaning supplants an antecedent one; it is supplement\\" (Owens, p54). These inclinations can be seen in works such as oil-barrels of Belgian artist Wim Delvoye and bullets of a gun by French artist Philippe Perrin. With reference to Walter Benjamin in The Origin of German Tragic Drama, he also links allegory with impermanence, the piling up of fragments and obsessional accumulation. These impulses can be seen, respectively, in site-specific art, photomontage and art that follows a mathematical progression (for instance Sol LeWitt). (Owens, p55-57).

History The band was formed in 1994 by Marcus Ehlin and Anders Rosdahl, who were joined within a few months by Fredrik Brockert. In February 1996 they recorded their first, self-titled, demo tape. After the demos release, the band was joined by Linus Ekstr√∂m. By this time, they had started playing gigs, supporting Swedish metal acts including Bewitched, Sacramentum and In Aeturnum. During the Halloween weekend of 1996 Siebenb√ºrgen recorded their second demo, Ungentum Pharelis. This demo led to a contract with Napalm Records, and their release of their first album, Loreia, in 1997. In October/November 1997, Siebenb√ºrgen had three shows in Germany, with Forbidden Site and Menhir. During January/February 1998, Siebenb√ºrgen recorded their second album, Grimjaur, which was released in May the same year, followed by another tour in July, this time with Atanatos and Ragnar√∂k. After the release of Grimjaur, Lovisa Hallstedt, who had contributed female vocals and violin on all previous releases, left the band. She was replaced in 1999 with a new female vocalist, Kicki H√∂ijertz. On their next tour, Siebenb√ºrgen were accompanied by Tristania, The Sins of Thy Beloved, Trail of Tears and Antichrisis. The tour consisted of 18 shows, performed in Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. Beginning with the follow-up to Grimjaur, titled Delictum, Siebenb√ºrgen made what many still consider to be a departure from their previous direction, choosing to write lyrics in English instead of Swedish (though some albums during the early to mid 2000s contain songs in Swedish). As the lyrics continued to depict creatures from old folklore, written in the style of dark poetic fairytales, some defend the position that Siebenb√ºrgen merely opted to use a more widely spoken language for their lyrics, in order to be more inclusive to fans who do not understand their native language, whilst leaving the actual content of their output unchanged. After a hiatus starting in 2006, they reformed in 2007 with a new lineup. In 2008, Revelation VI was released. Siebenb√ºrgen disestablished again in 2009.

Like his younger contemporary Stevan St. Mokranjac, he was devoted to mainly vocal genres‚Äîlied and choral. Marinkoviƒá was a romanticist with a pronounced affinity for melodic expression. He invested exceptional attention to the text declamation, which represented a rather novel quality in Serbian music at the time.  Biography  Marinkoviƒá graduated at the Prague Organ School (1873‚Äì81) and attended specialized studies in Vienna (1886‚Äì87). He acted as choral director of the Belgrade Singing Society (1881‚Äì87), Academic Singing Society Obiliƒá (1889‚Äì1900), as well as other choral ensembles (The Laborers‚Äô Singing Society and Serbian-Jewish Singing Society, among others). He also taught music at the Serbian Orthodox Seminary, Teachers‚Äô Preparatory School, and The Second Men's Gymnasium. Marinkoviƒá was inducted into the Serbian Royal Academy (today Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) in 1907. As a composer of a distinct romanticist expression, Marinkoviƒá often utilized folk melodies. He composed patriotic songs for men's choir, the most popular among them being The People‚Äôs assembly ((Narodni zbor) 1876, after the text by S. Kaƒáanski) of an upbeat, march-like character, thus considered a symbol of the feisty spirit of Serbian people, With a song to the heart, and Slavia (Slavija); lyrical pieces for mixed choir and compositions for children's choir, among others. Marinkoviƒá composed eleven Kolos, based on a mosaic-like assemblage of folk tunes (Branko‚Äôs kolos being the third, fifth, and ninth kolo, upon The School friends‚Äô parting (ƒêaƒçki rastanak) lyrics by Branko Radiƒçeviƒá, featuring stylized melodies from Vojvodina). Among piano- accompanied choral works similar to cantatas, significant are A Content river (Zadovoljna reka) and The Water mill ((Potoƒçara) with text-painting), of lyrical character, both written after the text by Jovan Milenko Grƒçiƒá, and also a patriotic choral work On Good Friday (Na Veliki petak). In his lieder, Marinkoviƒá paid closed attention to the correct diction, lilting melody, and expressive piano accompaniment with which he depicted certain desired atmosphere. He composed lieder after the lyrics of Serbian poets Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj, J. Grƒçiƒá Milenko, and Vojislav Iliƒá (Tell me, please, tell me (Ka≈æi mi, ka≈æi), The Parting (Rastanak), The stream gurgles (Potok ≈æubori), Oh, How the sun shines (Oh, kako sunce sija), Prayer (Molitva), A Shrub (Grm), etc.). In his church works, Marinkoviƒá was inspired by Serbian Church chanting (Liturgy, for mixed choir) and influences of Russian Church music (Opelo (Orthodox Requiem), O, Heavenly King (Carju nebesni), Angel vopija≈°e, etc.). Marinkoviƒá often reworked his pieces, thus they exist in several versions.  Works = Lieder = Lieder, composed after the lyrics by romanticist poets and folk motives, occupy the most significant place in Marinkoviƒá's oeuvre. He is considered the founder of this genre in Serbian music. The most compelling are lieder composed upon art poetry lyrics (by J. J. Zmaj, J. G. Milenko, ƒê. Jak≈°iƒá, and V. Iliƒá). In his lieder, Marinkoviƒá achieved a broad range of moods‚Äîhearty lyricism (What a sight, this world‚Äôs so bright (Ala je lep ovaj svet), Oh, How the sun shines, The stream gurgles), romanticist warmth, melodic breadth (Longing (ƒåe≈ænja)), and drama (The Parting, A Shrub). He arranged many of his songs in several versions and provided an insight into his creative evolution and development toward a seasoned compositional and technical mastery. Marinkoviƒá exhibits the ability of deep delving into the meaning and mood of selected lyrics, following the correct diction, with inventive, broad melodies, and an overall direct expression. Melody represents his primary tool; although in his later works noticeable is a rather elaborated piano part and somewhat free harmonic language, within the realm of the late romanticist means of expression. Marinkoviƒá also found his inspiration in the texts close to folk songs and composed in the manner close to folk, establishing in Serbian art music a popular sevdalinka genre (≈†ana, dear, Stojanka, and From town to town). He also continued and preserved the tradition of rearranging the folk tunes. = Choral music: secular works= Marinkoviƒá composed pieces for men's, mixed, women's, and children's choirs, but particularly nurtured the genre of choral pieces with piano accompaniment. His eleven kolos (1881‚Äì97)‚Äîwreaths of adapted folk tunes for men's and mixed choirs, are considered precursors of S. St. Mokranjac's Song Wreaths. Utilizing a large number of songs lacking a more complex adaptation, Marinkoviƒá failed to reach a well rounded and complex form later manifested in Mokranjac's works, but however, anticipated some of Mokranjac's procedures (linking and repetition of song excerpts, songs, and alike). The actual selection of the kolo songs does not demonstrate the level of fastidiousness and cogitation in the scope the works‚Äô entirety, so representative for Mokranjac, while the developing procedures are mainly restrained, but still refreshing and uplifting. In the later kolos (Eleventh and Twelfth), Marinkoviƒá achieved a higher formal conciseness, better choral texture, contrasts of solo and tutti parts, and bolder harmonic solutions. The three kolos (The Third, Fifth, and Ninth) are named after Branko Radiƒçeviƒá (Branko‚Äôs kolos (sing., Brankovo kolo)) since they are composed after this poet's lyrics entitled The School friends‚Äô parting and are only indirectly folk-inspired. Much like his contemporaries, Marinkoviƒá composed works upon patriotic poetry lyrics (The People‚Äôs assembly, A Heroic battle cry (Junƒçaki pokliƒç), The Balkans anthem, The Kosovo anthem, With a song to the heart, The Serbian Muslims‚Äô anthem), some of which became rather popular, such as The People‚Äôs assembly (1876) famous for its opening verse, as well as the song Hey, Trumpeter. As one of the most popular Marinkoviƒá's songs, it was the Obiliƒá anthem for many years. Marinkoviƒá established a piano accompanied choral genre in Serbian music (A Content river, On Good Friday, A Suffering mother (Jadna majka), Prayer, The Water mill, and Cantata to Dositej Obradoviƒá). By their broadness and complexity of the piano accompaniment, some of these works confirm that the piano was in fact used as an orchestra substitute. = Choral music: sacred works = In 1935, Kosta Manojloviƒá reconstructed certain movements he found in Marinkoviƒá's legacy collection into the Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom (Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog). Among the Liturgy movements particularly expressive and inspiring is Our Father (Otce nas), considered one of the master pieces of choral literature. = Instrumental and stage music = Bust of Josif Marinkoviƒá in Belgrade Among instrumental pieces, Marinkoviƒá composed Sonatina for piano in four hands, and Two Serbian dances, Fantasia, and Nocturne for violin. His stage music includes plays Suƒëaje by Lj. Petroviƒá (with very successful numbers The Lullaby and The Monk chorus).

The gens Marcia, occasionally written Martia, was one of the oldest and noblest houses at ancient Rome. They claimed descent from the second and fourth Roman Kings, and the first of the Marcii appearing in the history of the Republic would seem to have been patrician; but all of the families of the Marcii known in the later Republic were plebeian. The first to obtain the consulship was Gaius Marcius Rutilus in 357 BC, only a few years after the passage of the lex Licinia Sextia opened this office to the plebeians.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 940 (\\"Marcia Gens\\"). Origin The Marcii are supposed to have been Sabines, descended from a certain Marcus Marcius of Cures, a kinsman of Numa Pompilius, and his son, Numa Marcius, a childhood friend of Pompilius, who accompanied him to Rome and served as his chief advisor. His son, the younger Numa Marcius, was urban prefect under Tullus Hostilius, and his grandson was Ancus Marcius, the fourth King of Rome. Although the Roman monarchy was not strictly hereditary, tradition holds that the sons of Ancus Marcius hoped to succeed their father, but were prevented from doing so when his chief advisor, the Etruscan Lucius Tarquinius, took advantage of their absence at the time of the king's death to solicit support for his own claim, and was elected king.Livy, i. 35. After biding their time for many years, the sons of Marcius gained their revenge by engineering the assassination of Tarquin, but they were again prevented from claiming the throne by a ruse of Tanaquil, the Roman queen, who installed her stepson, Servius Tullius, as regent, until he had sufficient support to rule on his own. The later Marcii claimed descent from Ancus Marcius, but nothing further is recorded of his sons or the generations between them and the Marcii of the early Republic.Livy, i. 41. The nomen Marcius is a patronymic surname, based on the common praenomen Marcus. There is no reason to doubt that both names are in turn derived from the god Mars, although the precise linguistic process by which this occurred is complex and uncertain.Chase, pp. 131, 158, 159. Praenomina L. Marcius Philippus, minted in 56 BC. The obverse is a portrait of Ancus Marcius, the legendary 4th king of Rome and founder of the gens. The reverse depicts the Aqua Marcia, built by Q. Marcius Rex in 144 BC, who also had his statue on the aqueduct.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 448, 449. The Marcii were relatively conservative with respect to praenomina, with only three names accounting for nearly all of the Marcii of the Republic. Most branches of the family used Lucius, but preferred either Gaius or Quintus, seldom if ever using both in the same branch. There were isolated instances of Publius, Marcus, and perhaps one instance of Gnaeus, although this case is doubtful. All were very common names throughout Roman history; but there was also at least one Septimus, a praenomen that was quite rare at Rome. The ancient praenomina Numa and Ancus evidently passed out of use some time before the establishment of the Republic. Both are likely Sabine or Oscan names, as were all of the persons known to have borne them. No attempt seems to have been made to revive either of them at Rome, either as praenomen or cognomen. Numa seems to be related to Numitor, the name of one of the ancient Kings of Alba Longa, and the grandfather of Romulus, and may share a common root with the praenomen Numerius, which remained in use at Rome for many centuries; Chase suggests a meaning related to \\"arranger\\" or \\"orderer\\", which would suit both Numa Pompilius and his kinsman, Numa Marcius. For Ancus, otherwise known only from the legendary founder of the Publician gens, he suggests the meaning of \\"servant\\", perhaps in the religious sense.Chase, p. 144. Branches and cognomina The only surname associated with the patrician Marcii was Coriolanus, which does not seem to have represented a distinct family of the Marcian gens. During the time of the Republic, the plebeian Marcii bore the cognomina Censorinus, Crispus, Figulus, Libo, Philippus, Ralla, Rex, Rufus, Rutilus, Septimus, Sermo, and Tremulus. Those of Censorinus, Libo, and Philippus are found on coins. Coriolanus, the earliest cognomen of the Marcii, and the only one generally believed to have belonged to any of the patrician Marcii, was the personal surname of Gaius Marcius, a young soldier whose brilliant charge through the gates of Corioli resulted in the capture of that town from the Volscians. We are told that he had two young sons, from whom one might imagine that the later Marcii were descended; but all of the later Marcii known to history were plebeians. If any of them were descendants of Coriolanus, then they must have stepped down or been removed from the patrician order. The surname Coriolanus does not appear to have been passed down to later generations of the Marcii.Livy, ii. 40.Chase, p. 113. The earliest family of the plebeian Marcii bore the surname of Rutilus, meaning \\"reddish\\", probably signifying that the first of this family had red hair.Chase, p. 110. It is through this family that the Marcii emerged from obscurity, only a few years after the passage of the lex Licinia Sextia opened the consulship to the plebeians. The son of Gaius Marcius Rutilus, the first plebeian censor, was himself censor twice, and took the name Censorinus, which was thereafter passed down in this family for several centuries.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 682 (\\"Gaius Marcius Rutilus\\"). After this family, the next cognomen of the Marcii was Philippus, a Greek name, which first appears as the surname of Quintus Marcius, the consul of 281 BC; but this may anticipate the adoption of the name by his descendant, for a certain Lucius Marcius of this family is said to have had some connection with Philip V of Macedon; his son, Quintus Marcius Philippus, was consul in 186 BC, and it may therefore have been Lucius who was the first to obtain the cognomen. The initial cognomen of the family may have been Tremulus, since the filiations given in the Fasti link Quintus Marcius Tremulus, consul in 306, and his probable son Quintus Marcius Philippus, consul in 281. Philippus means \\"lover of horses\\", and the name had for centuries been associated with the Macedonian kings; Philip II was the father of Alexander the Great. So wide was the fame of this dynasty, that it is not entirely impossible that the name had reached Rome at an earlier date. The Philippi were proud of this association since Lucius Marcius Philippus, the consul of 91, even put the portrait of Philip V of Macedon on the denarii he minted.Chase, p. 114.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 285 (\\"Marcius Philippus\\", nos. 1‚Äì3).Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 307, 308. Friedrich M√ºnzer considers that the Marcii bearing the cognomen Figulus (\\"potter\\") were linked to the Philippi; the first of that name might have been the second son of Quintus Marcius Philippus, the consul of 281.PW, vol. 28, pp. 1557, 1558. The Figuli flourished until the end of the Republic, and obtained two consulships. Ralla seems to be the next surname of the Marcii, first appearing toward the close of the third century BC. It may mean \\"scraper\\", and Chase suggests a common origin with the radula, or \\"scraper\\", a standard carpentry tool. This family is only found in history for a brief period.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 640 (\\"Ralla\\"). The cognomen Rex, meaning \\"king\\", is usually interpreted as an allusion to the family's traditional descent from Numa Pompilius and Ancus Marcius.Chase, p. 112. However, another possibility is that the surname was borne by the descendants of a certain Marcus Marcius, Rex Sacrorum during the third century BC, and perhaps the first plebeian to hold that office.Broughton, vol. I, p. 282.Goldberg, \\"Priests and Politicians\\", p. 343. Members=Early Marcii= Lucius Marcius Philippus, circa 113 BC. The obverse depicts Philip V of Macedon.

Rather than face trial for his effrontery, he fled into exile among the Volsci, then led a Volscian force against Rome, withdrawing only at the pleas of his mother and sister.

While Fabius campaigned against the Etruscans, Marcius fought against the Samnites, and captured the town of Allifae, but was seriously wounded in a subsequent battle. He was one of the first plebeian pontiffs in 300 BC, and served as censor in 294; elected censor a second time in 265, he is said to have brought forward a law precluding anyone from holding the censorship twice in the future.Livy, ix. 30, 33, 38, x. 9, 47, Epitome 16.Diodorus Siculus, xx. 27.Eutropius, ii. 18.Valerius Maximus, iv. 1. ¬ß 3. =Marcii Censorini= * Gaius Marcius Censorinus, grandfather of Lucius Marcius Censorinus, consul in 149. * Gaius Marcius C. f.

Category:Roman gentes ","title":"Marcia gens"},{"id":"3940232","text":"Seth Fisher (July 22, 1972 ‚Äì January 30, 2006) was an American comic book artist. Biography Seth Fisher was born in Seattle in 1972, and lived in Coronado with his mother from age 5 to 10, until his mother remarried and the family moved to the East Coast with the Navy. In junior high school Fisher went to live with his father in Custer, South Dakota; his mother and stepfather soon moved back to Coronado, and he came every summer to visit. Fisher decided he wanted to be a comic book artist after attending his first Comic Con in San Diego when he was a freshman in college, circa 1991. After that, he started attending every year, bringing a portfolio of his work and standing in line for an editor at DC or Marvel Comics to look through the work and offer a real life critique. By the time he was 23, Fisher's work had improved enough to receive some real attention from professionals, though so far nothing that turned into a paycheck. After graduating from Colorado College in 1994 (with a degree in mathematics), Fisher went to Japan with the JET Programme, to teach English in a rural Japanese high school on the small Oki Islands. His initial attraction to Japan was its comic book culture. Fisher studied the intricacies of manga, and wanted to go to a country where an adult could read a comic book in public without feeling the need to hide it behind a copy of Newsweek. Fisher spent four years in Japan, and during that time started looking for a writer to do a comic with. Career Fisher first gained mainstream recognition for his and Andrew Dabb's Vertigo series Happydale: Devils in the Desert. Fisher met Dabb online in 1996, and they did an 8-page mini-comic that gave a feel for the story to pitch to a publisher. None of the contacted publishers accepted the story as, at the time, Fisher's style was considered too risky to publish. Eventually, Happydale was picked up by Jim Valentino for his Non-Line imprint, which folded when the book was half-done. After that, Fisher decided to finish the story to have it ready to be published, and took six months off work. In the meantime, he was contacted by Heavy Metal and Cricket magazines and did a few short stories for the first and illustrated a few prose stories for the latter. Upon completing the project, Fisher took it to SDCC '98, where he was immediately recognized by Andy Helfer. Helfer liked the presented work, agreed to pass it to Karen Berger, then-Vertigo editor, and in the meantime assigned Fisher to do some work for his Paradox Press imprint. In 1999, Fisher was hired by Presto Studios as one of the designers for Myst III: Exile, and took a year off of comics to work on it. After the game was completed, Fisher came back to DC with art samples and a story idea he pitched to editor Joey Cavalieri. However, after a brainstorming session, the idea was shelved and it was decided to have the presented art style as a starting point for a Hal Jordan story. Cavalieri assigned J. M. DeMatteis, then-writer of Jordan (in the Spectre incarnation) to script the project. At SDCC '00, Shelly Bond, Fisher's editor at Vertigo, introduced him to writer Jonathan Vankin and asked them to come up with a story set in Japan as she knew both of them had experience living there. After completing Green Lantern: Willworld, Fisher was eager to do more, so he was given a year-old Flash script by John Rozum. The Flash story had no deadline, so Fisher was able to work on both that and what would eventually become Vertigo Pop! Tokyo as well as a Batman story with Dan Curtis Johnson and J. H. Williams III (that wouldn't be released until three years later as \\"Snow\\" arc of Legends of the Dark Knight series). After finishing those projects, he contributed two fill-in issues to his then-favorite ongoing, John Arcudi and Tan Eng Huat's Doom Patrol. In 2003, Fisher was nominated for an Eisner Award in \\"Best Penciller/Inker\\" category for Flash: Time Flies and Vertigo Pop! Tokyo. After the expiration of his exclusive contract with DC (signed in 2001, renewed in 2002), Fisher took another break from comics to focus on his marriage and, later, the birth of son. In the meantime, he produced album covers in Finland and his adopted home of Japan, as well as some work for QuickJapan magazine and Dentsu ad agency. Fisher returned to comics once again in 2005, wanting to do a Fantastic Four or Iron Man project. Zeb Wells, writer of the eventual mini-series, recalled in an October 2005 interview, In a 1999 interview, Andrew Dabb stated he and Fisher had a sequel for Happydale planned sometime in the future; Zeb Wells planned to reunite with Fisher on an Ant-Man story; unfortunately, neither of these nor any other possible future Fisher projects ever came to be. Death J. H. Williams III first broke the news of Fisher's passing in a post at Barbelith Underground: The news was confirmed later that day by most major comics websites. Seth Fisher died in late January 2006 as a result of injuries suffered in a fall from a seventh story roof of an Osaka, Japan club where he went to celebrate the completion of the last issue of Big in Japan. Three works have been released posthumously: a project titled Build Your Own Backpack Alarm, written by Shar Levine and Leslie Johnstone ‚Äì a do-it-yourself guide to building a personal backpack security system ‚Äì for Scholastic, a short story titled \\"Freddy Wertham Goes to Hell\\" for Joe Hill's series Locke & Key, and Bob's Amazing Life, a children's book written and illustrated by Fisher for his son. Personal life In 1998, Fisher married his college girlfriend, April Brody, and they moved from Japan to Florence, Italy for a year so that April could study Italian. When Fisher was hired by Presto, he and April moved back to the United States to San Diego. Some years later, they divorced, and in 2002 Fisher moved back to Japan for six weeks of photographic research for Vertigo Pop! Tokyo. Acquiring an artist's visa to remain in Japan, Fisher reconnected with an old friend named Hisako Sugiyama, who would become his second wife. On May 5, 2004, the couple's son Toufuu Go Fisher was born. Bibliography Interior comic work includes: *The Big Book of... (anthology, Paradox Press):  \\"Warning!

He is notable for his four volumes of harmonized Serbian melodies, which were published in Vienna between 1858 and 1863 and are one of the most important foundations for later Serbian music.  Biography  He was born in a bourgeois Serbian family in Tab√°n, a part of Buda inhabited mostly by Serbs. After the death of his parents he lived with his elder sister in –êrad, where he went to primary school and attended two years of gymnasium. Later he moved to Szeged and returned to his brother's house in Taban, in order to finish school in Pest (1849). By a generous favour of family friends, Jelena and Pavle Riƒëiƒçki von Skribe≈°ƒáe, in the year 1850 his musical education started at the Conservatory in Vienna. He studied harmony and counterpoint, as well as the basic piano lessons, with a court composer and prominent organist Simon Sechter, also the professor of Anton Bruckner. Fertile musical life in Vienna and instructions from Sechter marked the most significant, but also the only part of Stankoviƒá's schooling. He was not able to go for musical specialization to Russia with his incurable disease, tuberculosis. He died early, in his thirty- fourth, on 4/16 April 1865 in Buda. He was buried in the Serbian cemetery in Taban. After moving this cemetery, his funeral remains were conveyed to the cemetery in Buda. In 1940, Musical society \\"Stankoviƒá\\" initiated their moving to the Alley of the Greats in Novo groblje in Belgrade.  Creative work = Cultural-historical background = The years of Stankoviƒá's life and work were imbued by numerous political events. Among them were the revolution 1848, absolutistic period of von Bach's reign and Crimean War, the breakdown of Bach's regime and the abolition of the Voivodeship of Serbia. In Serbia this was the period of the second reign of the Serbian Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá. The national movement among the Serbs was established by the work on language and folk literature done by Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá. Although himself not a singer, Vuk accepted the view of Jacob Grimm that lyrical folk poems should be supplemented with their music settings. Kornelije Stankoviƒá found an immediate model in Vuk's work. He was inspired to start an extensive work of collecting and harmonizing Serbian folk and church melodies. Intelligentsia both in the Habsburg Monarchy and in the Principality of Serbia supported this pioneer work on establishing a national style in Serbian music. Among them were the Serbian Patriarch Josif Rajaƒçiƒá, Russian priest and emissary in Vienna Mikhail Fedorovich Raevsky, the Serbian Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá, metropolitan of Serbia Mihailo and the Montenegrin Prince Danilo I. = Folk music = Portrait of Kornelije Stankovic Stankoviƒá started his melographic work in the field of folk songs and bourgeois melodies shortly after his arrival in Vienna. After the first published harmonizations, named Serbian Folk Songs (1851, 1853, 1854), he published four more collections (1858, 1859, 1862, 1863). Among the bourgeois songs he wrote down were also the verses of famous Serbian poets (Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj, Vasa ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Jovan Subotiƒá, ƒêorƒëe Maletiƒá, Aleksandar Sandiƒá).page 64 published by Aleksandar Sandiƒá in Ost und West. He arranged them as four-voice-choir compositions and miniatures or variations for piano (the most popular are the variations ≈†to se bore misli moje). During 1861 and 1863 he travelled and noted down folk melodies in Serbia (≈†abac, Loznica, Valjevo, ƒåaƒçak, U≈æice, Kragujevac). Stankoviƒá dedicated his published collections of folk songs to the Montenegrin Prince Danilo I, \\"to Serbian ladies\\", Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá and to the Russian imperial emissary in Vienna, Viktor P. Balabin. Collections of piano compositions were dedicated to the princess Julija Obrenoviƒá and Jelena Riƒëiƒçki. = Church music = The first two Liturgies written by Stankoviƒá while his studying with professor Sechter did not accord with the folk tradition of church singing. Stankoviƒá therefore went to Sremski Karlovci (1855‚Äì1857) where, under the supervision of the patriarch Rajaƒçiƒá, he put into notation the melodies of virtually the whole church repertoire. By harmonizing the great number of notated church melodies for four-voice choir, he left the rich inheritance to his Serbian people: three published books of the Orthodox Church Chant of the Serbian People (Vienna 1862, 1863, 1864 and Belgrade 1994, as a facsimile edition), as well as the 17 manuscript volumes with four part choral settings and five volumes with about 400 pages with traditional church chants from the Octoich, the General and special chant, Festal chants from the Menaia, the Triodion and the Pentekostarion. = Contribution to the work of singing societies = Before Kornelije Stankoviƒá, the newly founded Serbian church choirs and musical societies in Austro-Hungary and the Principality of Serbia had compositions of Russian composers and less famous musicians (Gottfried von Preyer and Benedict Randhartinger from Vienna, Francesco and Giuseppe Sinico from Trieste, Weiss von Berenfels from Petrinja) on their repertoire. With the publication of Stankoviƒá's work, new harmonizations of the Serbian chant became eligible for the singers and the conductors of the church choirs from Vienna, Trieste, Zadar, Kotor, Petrinja to Panƒçevo, Timi»ôoara and Belgrade. Brief but distinctive activity of Kornelije Stankoviƒá as a conductor of the First Belgrade Singing Society (1863‚Äì1864) particularly contributed to the affirmation of the Serbian national musical creativity. As a successor of Milan Milovuk, Stankoviƒá made a significant turn over on the repertoire by introducing new harmonized Serbian folk melodies instead of foreign songs. He founded a \\"preparatory choir\\", in order to provide extra, theoretical education to his singers. He also made a plan for founding the first music school in Belgrade. = Performances = Besides from arranging and publishing, Stankoviƒá also performed his transcriptions of traditional folk and church melodies as a pianist, with his friend, the painter and excellent baritone Stevan Todoroviƒá in Vienna, Pest, Buda, Belgrade, Novi Sad, Sremski Karlovci, Sombor, Panƒçevo, Sremska Mitrovica, ≈†abac, Valjevo, Kragujevac. He also performed his own, artistic piano compositions. As a conductor, he performed with the Belgrade Singing Society, the church choir in Buda and with foreign singers in Vienna. The very special success came with two concerts of Stankoviƒá's music in the famous Vienna concert hall (Musikverein) in 1855 and 1861. The prefaces in his firstly published collections of folk and church songs are classics about church chant in the 19th century, pearls of writings about Serbian vocal music and folk musical inheritance.  Honours  Kornelije Stankoviƒá on a 2009 Serbian stamp Stankoviƒá was honoured to receive the Order of Saint Stanislas from the Russian tsar for his melographic and creative work. The Serbian Church Choral Society of Panƒçevo, \\"Humanit√§tsverein\\" from Zagreb and Viennese \\"Musikverein\\", \\"Preodnica\\" and other youth societies gave him the title of an honorary member. He was respected and loved by his collaborators, acquaintances, friends and students. Stankoviƒá's devoted work on preservation and nurturing the Serbian folk creativity made an important, deep trace in the Serbian musical and cultural history. His name was celebrated through numerous studies and articles, by founding musical societies and other musical institutions which were named by him. On the initiative of prof. dr Danica Petroviƒá, in 1993 in Sremski Karlovci started the work of the Summer school of church chant \\"In memory of Kornelije\\". On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Stankoviƒá's birth (1981), Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts and the Institute of Musicology SASA organized a scientific assembly \\"Kornelije Stankoviƒá and his time\\". Twenty years later (2006), in the organization of the Institute of Musicology SASA, Matica srpska and Academy of Arts from Novi Sad, another, international scientific assembly \\"Composer and his environment\\" was held. This time it was on the occasion of the 175th anniversary of the birth of Stankoviƒá and the 150th anniversary of the birth of Stevan Stojanoviƒá Mokranjac. The collection of proceedings from the first assembly (published in 1985) is, so far, the most detailed edition about Stankoviƒá's life and work. He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.  Notes  :1. These manuscripts are kept in the Archives of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (Historical collection, No. 7888). Extensive work on transcription and redaction of composer‚Äôs manuscripts for publishing in Collected Works of Kornelije Stankoviƒá is in progress. This is the project led by prof. dr Danica Petroviƒá, director of the Institute of Musicology SASA.

They are highly variable in color, greys, browns, yellows, greens, and oranges with darker colored blotches. They have large eyes with vertical pupils.  Behavior  Malagasy cat-eyed snakes are found in a wide variety of habitats throughout the island of Madagascar, from montane regions to rain forest. Primarily nocturnal and terrestrial, they are capable of climbing and are strong swimmers. They feed on a variety of prey, including chameleons and rodents. Their venom is mild and often not powerful enough to subdue their chosen prey items, so they also employ constriction as necessary.  In captivity  Madagascarophis colubrinus and M. ocellatus are frequently imported for the exotic pet trade, and for educational research.

Miller was married to Lakehead University history professor Tom Miller. The couple was very active in the University community, and they along with other community members pushed for the school to offer degrees. Before her political activity, she was active in community theater. She is a member of the Order of Ontario. She died on February 14, 2012.  Early life  Miller was born on August 3, 1929 to parents William and Katherine Faircloth in Fort William Ontario. She was the eldest of seven children. Miller attended Peterborough Normal School for teacher training and taught in Port Hope Ontario for two years. In 1949 she married Tom Miller, and the couple moved to London England. They moved so Tom could attend the London School of Economics for the completion of his doctorate in history. Dusty Miller during this time worked as a school teacher at later at Canada House as a receptionist. They returned to the Thunder Bay region in 1954 and Miller became interested in the community's local theater scene. She became the Artistic Director of the Port Arthur Community Players (later the Cambrian Players) and held the position for nine years and directed many musicals and plays. Miller assisted Burton Lancaster in establishing Magnus Theater. She served as the theater's manager for the opening season in 1972-1973. She also taught theater in high schools and taught various fine arts courses at Lakehead University and Confederation College.

History and development The term 'Pagans in Recovery' appears to have first been used in a Neopagan newsletter from Ohio prior to 1989 which was titled \\"Pagans in Recovery\\".http://www.sacred- texts.com/bos/bos158.htm Isaac Bonewits also used the term in an essay he wrote in 1996.http://www.neopagan.net/PIR.html Why separate from regular twelve-step meetings? Many Pagans are uncomfortable with traditional twelve- step meetings because of the use of Christian prayers, the difficulty in finding supportive sponsors, the assumption that a person's Higher Power is male, etc.http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usxx&c;=words&id;=4583 Some Pagans find the 12 steps themselves too reminiscent of Christian theology to be applicable to their belief systems.http://www.angelfire.com/wi/theosis/aaspirit.html However, this type of conduct would not be approved by A.A. itself as any person who \\"has a desire to stop drinking\\" may declare themselves a member of A.A.http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/diskus/foltz.html The focus in alternative groups tends to be on tolerance, balance, building better boundaries, healing old wounds, making amends, taking our power back and right action. As a result, these groups tend to be more in tune with Pagan, New Age, Native American, humanistic, feminist, and Buddhist teachings, as well as with the more progressive versions of the mainstream faiths. Another issue among Pagans in recovery is the one-sided image of addicts, alcoholics, codependents, and survivors of dysfunctional families portrayed in official 12 Step literature and in the many books published on recovery and dysfunctional family systems since the 1980s. For example, Kasl and others in the field of addiction have long noted that the classic \\"Characteristics of Adult Children of Alcoholics\\"http://www.drjan.com/13char.html and the list known as \\"The Problem\\" in ACAhttp://www.adultchildren.org/lit/Problem.s (which are read at every ACA meeting) focus strongly on \\"character defects\\" and do not adequately support the creation or celebration of character strengths, strengths which are often the result of surviving these very systems. Many twelve-step programs, such as Narcotics Anonymous, have special interest groups, typically meetings specifically geared towards young people, men, women, gays and lesbians, etc.http://www.na.org/naway/en/naway4-e-4.htm Alcoholics Anonymous has also started meetings specifically for Native Americans which accommodate the Native American view of spirituality.http://www.naigso-aa.org/ Pagans who are recovering alcoholics have started A.A. meetings specifically for Paganshttp://news.earthhousemn.org/index.php?name=News&file;=article&sid;=1 What is different about recovery programs for Pagans? Many Pagans seem to prefer a mutually supportive, spiritually based twelve step approach to recoveryhttp://health.ivillage.com/mentalhealth/mhaddiction/0,,760v,00.html over non-spiritually based programs such as Secular Organizations for Sobriety, where one is expected to keep his or her spiritual beliefs separate from recovery,http://www.cfiwest.org/sos/find.htm or Rational Recovery, which is not spiritually based and does not encourage members to seek support from others in recovery.http://www.bookrags.com/other/drugs/rational-recovery-rr- edaa-03.html Generally speaking, Pagan twelve step meetings follow the same format as other twelve step meetings except that they use Pagan friendly readings (which have not been approved by the General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous or other twelve step organizations), and substitute Pagan friendly prayers for the Lord's Prayer (which is not AA Conference approved, but widely used) and the Serenity Prayer.http://www.jelder.com/Pagan/11SSC_protocol.PDF For example, the Recovery Spiral: A Pagan Path to Healing by Cynthia Jane Collins is sometimes used instead of or along with the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the Native American Great Spirit prayer may be substituted for the Lord's Prayer.http://www.rewritables.net/cybriety/recovery_prayers.htm Some Pagan twelve step groups have reworked or reworded the twelve steps so as to make them more applicable to Pagans, especially in allowing for a Polytheistic and non-gendered view of divinity.http://www.recovery.org/pagan.htm The members of Pagan twelve step groups are still expected to work the twelve steps as a means of spiritual growth, obtain a sponsor, make amends for harm they have caused, and to help others.http://www.sacredcenters.com/articles/recovery.htmlhttp://www.widdershins.org/vol1iss2/11.htm Some twelve step meetings for Pagans are eclectic, meaning that anyone from a twelve step recovery program, regardless of the nature of their addiction, may participate in the meeting. This is in sharp contrast to Alcoholics Anonymous' concept of \\"Singleness of Purpose\\" which holds that alcoholics should only work with other alcoholics.http://www.aaprimarypurpose.org/SinglePurpose.htm ReferencesExternal links *The Spiral Steps *Pagan ODAT group for overeaters *New Beginnings Pagan Recovery Support Group - Austin, TX *9-Step Pagans *13-Step Wiccan Recovery Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1989 Category:Twelve-step programs Category:Addiction and substance abuse organizations Category:Neopaganism and society ","title":"Pagans in Recovery"},{"id":"3940394","text":"Matthew John Costello (born 1948) is an American horror, Gothic, and science fiction writer.

Biography  Perun, Matija Vukoviƒá, (1962), Municipality Hall of New Belgrade, Novi Beograd Matija Vukoviƒá was born into a poor farming family in Platiƒçevo, on 26 July 1925. From his native village, near Ruma, after primary school, in 1937, the boy and his mother move to Belgrade, near the studios of the famous sculptor Toma Rosandiƒá. He was fascinated by the Maestros \\"huge figures\\", then Mestroviƒá's sculptures, and then in one of the books he got as a present book, he saw Michelangelo's Moses. All this will paved his way into the art. Vukoviƒá attended private art school of Mladen Josiƒá in 1941 ‚Äì 1942. Immediately after the liberation of the Belgrade, in October 1944, Matija Vukoviƒá was mobilized and sent to the Syrmian Front, where, during a charge, he was wounded in the hand. He returned home as a disabled veteran and ‚Äì devoted himself entirely to sculpture. Having successfully met the entrance exam, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts and was treated in parallel. He learned from the top Yugoslav sculptor Tom Rosandiƒá, and then attended the class of the professor Sreten Stojanoviƒá. He starts to exhibit in group exhibitions in 1949. Vukoviƒá graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in 1952. In 1954. during special classes of prof. Ilija Kolareviƒá he sculpts \\"Wounded Man\\" (1952‚Äì1953), which revealed his original creative style. First solo exhibition Matija Vukoviƒá had in 1954. at the Art Gallery at Kalemegdan. He has participated in numerous group exhibitions at home and abroad. His life was hard and he was for the most part misunderstood by his surroundings and critics. He died in Belgrade on 21 June 1985, after long disease.  Style  Wounded Man, Matija Vukoviƒá, 1952‚Äì53. Matija Vukoviƒá appeared at the time of break from the aesthetics of socialist realism, in the early 1950s, with works that are significantly different from academic form. His basic forms, that retain the illusion of \\"realism\\" and a distant figurative narrative, are shaped by powerful, cruel, deformed masses that have a vibrant creative expression of the author, which became his plastic sign, and at the same time, a unique figure in the Yugoslav sculpture of the late 20th century. With his work Matija Vukoviƒá pointed to yet another possibility of modernizing new form, which will be free to develop towards plastic conceived by the author. Matija Vukoviƒá has built one of the most authentic works of contemporary Serbian and Yugoslav sculpture after 1950.

Starring Rory Calhoun, it is a fictional account of the island of Rhodes during its Classical period in the late third century before coming under Roman control, using the Colossus of Rhodes as a backdrop for the story of a war hero who becomes involved in two different plots to overthrow a tyrannical king: one by Rhodian patriots and the other by Phoenician agents. The film was Leone's first work as a credited director, in a genre where he already had worked before (as the replacement director for The Last Days of Pompeii and as a secondary director for both Ben-Hur and Quo Vadis). It is perhaps the least known of the seven films he officially directed, and is notable for being the only one without an Ennio Morricone score. The film is also notable for its unusual time period: The time following Alexander the Great‚Äôs death (323 BC) but before the rise of the Roman empire (27 BC), known as the Hellenistic era. Most sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950s and 1960s were set in either classical Greece or even earlier (Hercules, Ulysses, The Giant of Marathon) or the later Roman period (Ben Hur, The Magnificent Gladiator, Quo Vadis). The only other films made during the peplum era to use a Hellenistic setting are Hannibal (1959), Revak the Rebel and Siege of Syracuse (both 1960). Plot A Greek military hero named Darios (Rory Calhoun) visits his uncle Lissipu (George Rigaud) on the island of Rhodes in the year 280 BC. Rhodes has just finished constructing an enormous colossal statue of the god Apollo to guard its harbor and is planning an alliance with Phoenicia, which would be hostile to Greece. Darios flirts with the beautiful Diala (Lea Massari), daughter of the statue's mastermind, Carete (F√©lix Fern√°ndez), while becoming involved with a group of rebels headed by Peliocles (Georges Marchal). These rebels seek to overthrow Rhodes' tyrannical king Serse (Roberto Camardiel); but so does Serse's evil second-in-command, Thar (Conrado San Mart√≠n). He has Phoenician soldiers smuggled into Rhodes as slaves, and his men occupy the Colossus to secure safe entrance for the Phoenician fleet. The rebels learn of this plan and decide to apply to the Greeks for help; Darios, who is forbidden to leave Rhodes as he is suspected a spy, is to serve as an unwitting message carrier. But as they try to exit the harbor under the cover of night, they are foiled by the Colossus's defensive weaponry and arrested; Darios is of course convicted as a fellow conspirator. However, just before the captives are to be executed, the rest of the rebels break them out. In their hideout, Peliocles decides that the only way to stop the invasion is to control the Colossus and free their fellow rebels who have already been captured and sentenced to work as slaves beneath the Colossus; the release mechanism for the dungeons is located in the statue itself. Darios realizes that without reconnaissance the mission is doomed to fail and tries to enlist Diala's aid. Unfortunately, he foolishly tells her about the rebels' hideout. Diala, who longs for power, betrays Darios and has Thar have the rebels nearly wiped out ‚Äì with the exceptions of Mirte (Mabel Karr) and Koros (√Ångel Aranda), Peliocles' sister and brother, who have managed to hide. Peliocles and his men are captured and forced to provide amusement in the local arena; but just when Darios arrives to publicly expose the traitor's plot, Thar executes his coup and kills Serse and his retainers. The rebels immediately set out to carry out their plan, but the rebellion seems doomed to fail: Darios is captured while he tries to work the release mechanism to the dungeons, and Koros, who accompanies him, is killed. An all-out assault of the rebels on the Colossus is foiled by its formidable arsenal, which forces them to retreat into the city. Thar's soldiers kill Diala's father, who does not want to see his life's work abused. An earthquake and a violent storm hit the island just as the enemy fleet is visible on the horizon. Thar and his men flee the Colossus when a tremor shakes the structure violently, only to be slain by the rebels in the city streets; Diala, plagued with remorse, frees Darios but is soon afterwards killed by falling debris. As the quake continues, the Colossus finally topples over and crashes into the harbor bay. After the fury of nature has passed, Darios and Mirte meet Lissipu outside the ruined city. Lissipu remarks that Darios is now free to leave, but his nephew announces that he will marry Mirte and stay in Rhodes to help make the island peaceful again.

Depiction of the Colossus Although no physical references of the original Helios Colossus are known to exist, the structure is rendered in this film as being an Etruscan image of the god Apollo following the kouros style of sculpture, with a slight ‚Äúarchaic smile.‚Äù It is shown to be about 300 feet high (nearly three times the height of its historical counterpart) holding a bowl at chest level with elbows raised outward, straddling each side of the harbor entrance. It is also revealed to be a hollow metal sculpture, much on the same order as the Statue of Liberty, with several interesting features: an interior spiral staircase leading to a second set of stairs at the head of the statue; a chain system that runs practically the height of the statue, which controls sliding doors to a dungeon; permanent openings at the pupils of the eyes and the ears ‚Äì large enough for a man to pass through; a drawbridge-style door hidden in the center chest that opens to the bowl; the bowl can be filled with burning materials and used as an altar; the fire in the bowl can be dropped on anything beneath by means of a divided trap door on its bottom; and the entire top third of the statue's head has a dodecagonal opening that allows for catapults to be fired out of it. While the statue in the film is shown to be made of iron and burnished brass (or perhaps bronze) and barefoot, barechested and bareheaded, wearing only a short men's Greek-style skirt and a headband, the original poster depicts the statue as highly polished bronze, completely outfitted with Roman sandals and armor, including a centurion‚Äôs imperial galea.

In 1996, Leifer met Lori Wolf, a Jewish real estate executive, when they shared a table at a Project Angel Food charity dinner in Los Angeles. Although Leifer had identified as heterosexual up until then, she later contacted Wolf through the host of their table, though Wolf initially rebuffed Leifer's overtures because Wolf was in a relationship at the time. Wolf contacted Leifer weeks later, after Wolf had ended her relationship, and began one with Leifer. They moved in together in 2005, and in acclimating herself to Wolf's pets, Leifer became an animal rights activist. It was for this reason that she chose North Shore Animal League as her charity when she appeared in The Celebrity Apprentice.

Life Born in Dundee, the son of Andrew Patrick, an architect and amateur artist who encouraged his son to draw and paint, Patrick studied painting at Glasgow School of Art from 1924 to 1928, studying with Maurice Greiffenhagen,James McIntosh Patrick's profile at www.electricscotland.com and in Paris. He continued his interest in etching which was very popular in the 1920s and was to prove a source of income for him during the Depression years. A foremost landscape painter, he began his career producing highly finished etchings, but when the market for these collapsed in the 1930s he turned towards painting in watercolour and oil. Patrick produced portraits and still life works but is known mainly for his paintings of cultivated landscapes in the Scottish countryside. They are often very wide in scope yet meticulously detailed. In this he has been compared to Bruegel. His style was traditional but his use of colour could be bold, as were some compositional aspects of several of his paintings. In Spring in Eskdale (1935) the scene seems to be viewed from a height, giving an almost aerial view, while in Stobo Kirk (1936) perspective is again deliberately but subtly distorted. Less unconventionally, his landscapes frequently make use of lanes, roads, waterways or other features leading from foreground to middle distance or beyond, drawing the viewer into the picture. This compositional trademark can be seen in one of his earliest landscapes, The Three Sisters, Glencoe (1934), Spring in Eskdale, and many of his later works. Like many artists of the interwar period, he was profiled as an 'Artist of Note' in The Artist magazine, Vol XIV No 3, in November 1937. He received many awards including the Guthrie Prize and was elected a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1957.Visit Dunkeld website He was appointed OBE in the 1997 Birthday Honours Works His works are displayed at such venues as McManus Galleries and Museum, Dundee, Aberdeen Art Gallery, Glasgow Art Gallery, Edinburgh City Art Centre, Manchester Art Gallery, the Walker Art Gallery, the National Gallery of South Africa, National Gallery of South Australia, the Sydney Art Gallery, and the Carnegie Institute (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA). In 1999 the Patrick family donated his archives to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. To celebrate its victory in the 1983 University Challenge competition, the University of Dundee commissioned Patrick to produce to two paintings of its campus.

This abnormality, attributed to a genetic mutation, is known to affect dogs and humans. Distichiae (the abnormal eyelash) usually exit from the duct of the meibomian gland at the eyelid margin. They are usually multiple, and sometimes more than one arises from a duct. They can affect either the upper or lower eyelid and are usually bilateral. The lower eyelids of dogs usually have no eyelashes. Distichiae usually cause no symptoms, because the lashes are soft, but they can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, corneal ulcers and scarring. Treatment options include manual removal, electrolysis, electrocautery, CO2 laser ablation, cryotherapy, and surgery. Commonly affected breeds In veterinary medicine, some canine breeds are affected by distichiasis more frequently than others: *Cocker Spaniel *Dachshund (especially the miniature longhaired Dachshund) *Bulldog *Pekingese *Yorkshire Terrier *Flat-Coated Retriever *Shetland Sheepdog *Boxer *Poodle Ectopic cilia An ectopic cilia is a special type of distichia usually found in younger dogs. Commonly affected breeds include Poodles, Golden Retrievers, and Shih Tzus. The eyelash exits through the conjunctiva of the eyelid facing toward the eye, usually at the middle of the upper eyelid.

It occurs at the meeting point of the talus and the calcaneus. The joint is classed structurally as a synovial joint, and functionally as a plane joint. Structure The talus is oriented slightly obliquely on the anterior surface of the calcaneus. There are two points of articulation between the two bones: one anteriorly and one posteriorly: * At the anterior talocalcaneal articulation, a convex area of the talus fits on a concave surface of the calcaneus.http://www.physio- pedia.com/images/c/c0/Principles_of_Joint_Mobilization.pdf * The posterior talocalcaneal articulation is formed by a concave surface of the talus and a convex surface of the calcaneus. There are three articulating facets between the talus and the calcaneus, delineated as the anterior, middle and posterior facets. The sustentaculum tali forms the floor of middle facet, and the anterior facet articulates with the head of the talus, and sits lateral and congruent to the middle facet. The posterior facet is the largest of the three, and separated from the others by the tarsal canal. =Ligaments and membranes= The main ligament of the joint is the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament, a thick, strong band of two partially joined fibers that bind the talus and calcaneus. It runs through the sinus tarsi, a canal between the articulations of the two bones. There are four additional ligaments that form weaker connections between the talus and calcaneus. * The anterior talocalcaneal ligament (or anterior interosseous ligament) attaches at the neck of the talus on the front and lateral surfaces to the superior calcaneus. * The short band of the posterior talocalcaneal ligament extends from the lateral tubercle of the talus to the upper medial calcaneus. * The short, strong lateral talocalcaneal ligament connects from the lateral talus under the fibular facet to the lateral calcaneus, and runs parallel to the calcaneofibular ligament. * The medial talocalcaneal ligament extends from the medial tubercle of the talus to the sustentaculum tali on the medial surface of the calcaneus. A synovial membrane lines the capsule of the joint, and the joint is wrapped in a capsule of short fibers that are continuous with the talocalcaneonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints of the foot. Function The joint allows inversion and eversion of the foot, but plays no role in dorsiflexion or plantarflexion of the foot. It is considered a plane synovial joint, also commonly referred to as a gliding joint. The subtalar joint can also be considered a combination of the anatomic subtalar joint discussed above, and also the talocalcaneal part of the talocalcaneonavicular joint. This is the more common view of the subtalar joint when discussing its movement. When both of these articulations are accounted together, it allows for pronation and supination to occur.  Pathology  The subtalar joint is particularly susceptible to arthritis, especially when it has previously been affected by sprains. Symptoms of subtalar joint arthritis include pain when walking, loss of motion through the joint's range of motion, and difficulty walking on uneven surfaces. Physical therapy, orthotics, and surgery are the main treatment options. References * Calais-Germain, Blandine. \\"Anatomy of Movement\\", Eastland Press, 1993.

This is a very rare benign neoplasm, that makes up about 1% of all salivary gland tumors, or about 4% of all benign salivary gland tumors. A hematoxylin and eosin stained slide of canalicular adenoma showing multifocality Presentation Most patients present in the 7th decade of life, with females affected much more commonly than males (about a 4:1 ratio). The vast majority of the tumors present in the upper lip, although a few present in the palate or buccal (cheek) tissue as a slowly enlarging mass. It is curious that the tumor may show multifocality or multinodularity, a finding that should not be confused with invasion clinically or with malignancy. Diagnosis Tumors are usually small because they come to clinical attention early on in development, with an average size of about 1.6 cm. There is a very characteristic appearance to the tumor when reviewed histologically. A hematoxylin and eosin stained slide of canalicular adenoma showing large canaliculi There is a canalicular pattern with cords and ribbons showing connection points between opposing columnar cells within spaces that is called a \\"string of pearls\\" appearance. A hematoxylin and eosin stained slide of canalicular adenoma showing beading There are often small luminal squamous balls or morules. There is a very well developed supporting tissue that is a loose, fibrillar stroma, rich in hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate. In a few cases small calcifications or microliths may be present. Although seldom necessary, a pathologist can do immunohistochemistry studies to confirm the diagnosis, with the cells strongly reactive with pancytokeratin, S100 protein and SOX10, with a delicate GFAP reaction around the periphery. Even though it is a benign tumor, it must be separated from a basal cell adenoma, pleomorphic adenoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and polymorphous adenocarcinoma.

It was published in 1947. In this book, the three families of major characters in the series, the Swallows (the Walker family), the Amazons (the Blackett sisters) and the Ds (the two Callums), are all reunited in a book for the first time since Pigeon Post. This book is set in the Outer Hebrides and the two familiar Ransome themes of sailing and ornithology come to the fore. Sources For this story, Ransome was inspired by an adult fan, Myles North, an avid birdwatcher who wrote a letter to Ransome which supplied a detailed outline of much of the basic plot. He also supplied the famous phrase \\"What's hit's history: what's missed's mystery\\". Ransome also made a visit to Lewis in the Outer Hebrides for a fishing trip and to research the area as the setting for the book. Plot summary The Swallows, Amazons and Ds are all on a sailing cruise with Captain Flint in the Outer Hebrides. While the older members of the party clean the boat before returning her to the owner, the younger ones explore inland and a mysterious bird is seen nesting on an island in a loch. The question arises whether it is a great northern diver, which has never been known to nest in the British Isles, or a black-throated diver. Mr Jemmerling, the expert whom they consult, turns out to be a deadly enemy of the birds, as he collects birds' eggs and stuffed skins of birds. Hence they try to protect the birds while gathering photographic evidence of their nesting. Complicating the matter is a misunderstanding with the local Scottish inhabitants or Gaels who are mostly Gaelic speaking, and believe that their visitors have been sent by rival landowners to spoil the deer-shooting (the local livelihood) by driving the deer from their traditional breeding grounds. While trying to distract Jemmerling and his employee, the children and Captain Flint are rounded up by the ghillies (gamekeepers or gamewardens) of the local laird (called \\"The McGinty\\") and locked in a barn. They succeed in attracting the laird's attention and eventually in explaining what is going on, and his conviction is reinforced by the sound of a gunshot, which angers the laird and alters his view. He turns out to be a person of impeccably good manners who apologises profusely to his visitors for the way they have been treated. His son Ian (\\"the young chieftain\\") also befriends the children, and everyone delights in the recovery of the divers' eggs and their restoration to the nest before they have gone cold. Ransome entrusts this task to Titty and Dick, the two characters whom his biographer Hugh Brogan considered to be Ransome's favourites, because they contained the most of his own personality. Ransome was personally a strong supporter of the protection of birds, and had previously advocated it in his novel Coot Club to which cross-reference is made in this book. As the plot involves more excitement and violence than usual, with the egg-collector attempting to shoot the rare bird of the title, some have classified this book as one of the metafictional stories in the series: a fantasy tale made up by the children themselves. The other two books generally agreed to be metafictional are Peter Duck and Missee Lee. However, Arthur Ransome himself made it clear that this story was not metafiction. Writing to Myles North, discussing the book's dedication, he says: :...At all costs it must do nothing to weaken the reality ... nothing to suggest that it is a mere story and not the record of an actual happening, even if for bird protection's sake, the details are somewhat disguised.

A partial dislocation of a lens is termed lens subluxation or subluxated lens; a complete dislocation of a lens is termed lens luxation or luxated lens. Ectopia lentis in dogs and cats Although observed in humans and cats, ectopia lentis is most commonly seen in dogs. Ciliary zonules normally hold the lens in place. Abnormal development of these zonules can lead to primary ectopia lentis, usually a bilateral condition. Luxation can also be a secondary condition, caused by trauma, cataract formation (decrease in lens diameter may stretch and break the zonules), or glaucoma (enlargement of the globe stretches the zonules). Steroid administration weakens the zonules and can lead to luxation, as well. Lens luxation in cats can occur secondary to anterior uveitis (inflammation of the inside of the eye). =Anterior lens luxation= With anterior lens luxation, the lens pushes into the iris or actually enters the anterior chamber of the eye. This can cause glaucoma, uveitis, or damage to the cornea. Uveitis (inflammation of the eye) causes the pupil to constrict (miosis) and trap the lens in the anterior chamber, leading to an obstruction of outflow of aqueous humour and subsequent increase in ocular pressure (glaucoma). Better prognosis is valued in lens replacement surgery (retained vision and normal intraocular pressure) when it is performed before the onset of secondary glaucoma. Glaucoma secondary to anterior lens luxation is less common in cats than dogs due to their naturally deeper anterior chamber and the liquification of the vitreous humour secondary to chronic inflammation. Anterior lens luxation is considered to be an ophthalmological emergency. =Posterior lens luxation= With posterior lens luxation, the lens falls back into the vitreous humour and lies on the floor of the eye. This type causes fewer problems than anterior lens luxation, although glaucoma or ocular inflammation may occur. Surgery is used to treat dogs with significant symptoms. Removal of the lens before it moves to the anterior chamber may prevent secondary glaucoma. =Lens subluxation= Lens subluxation is also seen in dogs and is characterized by a partial displacement of the lens. It can be recognized by trembling of the iris (iridodonesis) or lens (phacodonesis) and the presence of an aphakic crescent (an area of the pupil where the lens is absent). Other signs of lens subluxation include mild conjunctival redness, vitreous humour degeneration, prolapse of the vitreous into the anterior chamber, and an increase or decrease of anterior chamber depth. Removal of the lens before it completely luxates into the anterior chamber may prevent secondary glaucoma. Extreme degree of luxation of lens is called \\"lenticele\\" in which lens comes out of the eyeball and becomes trapped under the Tenon's capsule or conjunctiva Shah SIA et al: Concise Ophthalmology Text & Atals. 5th ed. Param B (Pvt.) Ltd. 2018: 60-61 A nonsurgical alternative involves the use of a miotic to constrict the pupil and prevent the lens from luxating into the anterior chamber. =Breed predisposition= Terrier breeds are predisposed to lens luxation, and it is probably inherited in the Sealyham Terrier, Jack Russell Terrier, Wirehaired Fox Terrier, Rat Terrier, Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, Tibetan Terrier, Miniature Bull Terrier, Shar Pei, and Border Collie. The mode of inheritance in the Tibetan Terrier and Shar Pei is likely autosomal recessive. Labrador Retrievers and Australian Cattle Dogs are also predisposed.

She attended grade school in the Bayfield area until 1866 when her family moved to Greensboro, North Carolina. It was here that Lystra began attending private schools. When she was finished with school, at the age of 19, she married a man by the name of John Birney Gretter, where she then took the name, Lystra Gretter. Her husband, John, was approximately twenty six years older and a veteran of the Confederate Army led by Robert E. Lee. In the year 1881, Lystra and John welcomed their first and only daughter, Mary. In 1884, Lystra's husband John died, leaving her to raise their three-year-old daughter alone. In 1886, Lystra moved to Buffalo, New York with her mother and sister. It was then that she began attending school at the Buffalo General Hospital Training School for Nurses. Two years later, Lystra graduated with honors, well above many students in her class. Following graduation, she was given the position of Principal of the Farrand Training School for Nurses located in Detroit, Michigan at Harper Hospital. From 1889‚Äì1907, she maintained the position of the Nursing School Superintendent. It was during this time that Lystra made changes that affected the training of nurses around the country. She was changing the nursing programs from one year to two years and later on, to three years. She did this to allow future nurses more time on the floor, thus gaining more experience. With all of her effort in the training field, Gretter was one of the main reasons that Michigan became the second state in the nation to require a nursing certification. In 1908, Lystra was appointed Director of the Detroit Visiting Nurses Association. It was during this time that she found tuberculosis hospitals and also made way for the first free maternity and infant care clinics in Detroit, as well as made health screenings available to all school aged children. Although Gretter made a huge impact on the nursing world, she is most commonly known for composing, in part, along with the Committee for the Farrand Training School for Nurses, the Nightingale Pledge in 1893. The pledge is a modified version of the Hippocratic Oath, and although modified in many ways, is still used by physicians today. During her final years, Lystra helped in the gathering of nurses for the American Red Cross Nursing Service during both World Wars as well as maintained her position of the Detroit Visiting Nurses Association. She remained in Grosse Pointe, Michigan until she died in 1951. In 2004, Lystra Gretter was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame for the immense time and effort she put in promoting \\"nursing as a profession\\" during the 19th and 20th centuries.

Profile  Vallance is best known as Bryan Adams' songwriting partner from 1978 to 1989 and again from 2005 to 2019. Vallance has also been involved with the music industry member associations. Performing Rights Organization of Canada Limited (PROCAN), Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), FACTOR and Songwriters Association of Canada (SAC).  Biography = Early life = James Douglas Vallance was born on May 31, 1952 in Chilliwack, BC. He grew up in a series of small towns on the west coast of Canada, including Vanderhoof (1964-1967) and Terrace (1967-1970) where he collected fond memories that would later show up in lyrics to some of his songs, like 'Summer of '69'.Interview with The Musician's Voice, Jim Vallance Interviews He took piano lessons starting at age 7. He then took up guitar and drums at 13. In 1965 he formed a band with some classmates called The Tremelones which was later renamed The Fourmost. At 18, he enrolled in the music program at the University of British Columbia where he studied piano under Frances Marr Adaskin, flute with Conrad Crocker and cello with Hans Seigrist. He re-entered the UBC Music program again in 1973 but dropped out to travel Europe with a fellow musicians Peter Bjerring (aka Peter Berring) and Tom Mirhady . = Prism (as Rodney Higgs) = Vallance joined Vancouver jazz- blues-rock band Sunshyne as a drummer in the early 70s. There he met band member Bruce Fairbairn who would later become an influential Canadian record producer. In 1975, Fairbairn approached Vallance about recording a demo of some of the band's music in hopes of landing a recording contract. Initially, the music was not Vallance's but after several rehearsals, Fairbairn asked Vallance to contribute some of his songs. One of them, \\"Open Soul Surgery\\" caught the ear of a record company executive at GRT who offered Fairbairn's group a recording contract. Using various musicians from Sunshyne and another Vancouver band, Seeds of Time, Fairbairn recorded and produced a nine-song album, seven of which were written by Vallance. The band was renamed Prism and Vallance decided to use the pseudonym \\"Rodney Higgs\\" rather than his real name in the album credits. The debut Prism album was a success as it hit platinum status in Canada (sales in excess of 100,000.) But Vallance decided to leave the Prism lineup before the next album (he didn't enjoy the lifestyle of touring with the constant travel). What he did enjoy was songwriting and arranging and preferred to work out of his makeshift home studio. Although Vallance left the band's lineup, he did help his former band mates by contributing one song for each of the subsequent two albums, then one more for the 2008 album Big Black Sky. = Adams-Vallance Songwriting Partnership = Early Years  Upon leaving the Prism lineup, Vallance worked as a session musician in and around Vancouver to earn a living while his ultimate objective was to be a full-time songwriter. He was in need of a performing artist as a vehicle to promote his songs. Meanwhile, a talented, brash young artist named Bryan Adams had just established himself on the Vancouver music scene with local band Sweeney Todd. Adams decided to leave the band for a solo career but at 18, he was still inexperienced in the music business. In search of assistance, an informal meeting was arranged between Vallance and Adams at a local record store. Vallance and Adams had known about each other through the Vancouver music scene, although they had never been introduced. At the meeting, both admitted they liked the idea of a songwriting partnership and agreed to forge one. The arrangement was twofold. In the long term, the songs would be primarily used as the material for Adams' solo career while, in the short term, they would serve as a source of income by licensing songs to other artists. The early going was quite difficult. Adams' solo demo recordings were rejected by numerous record companies. Persistence paid off as Adams-Vallance was signed as songwriting team by A&M; late in 1978. The songwriting tandem was unknown and as such most artists were not interested in considering their songs. Vallance then landed a contract to write and arrange BTO's next album Rock n' Roll Nights through his association with talent manager Bruce Allen. The role of producer was added midway through recordings when the band fired the first producer. In all 5 songs were contributed: Vallance wrote two, \\"Jamaica\\" and \\"Rock 'n Roll Hell\\", co-wrote 2 other songs with BTO members while Adams contributed \\"Wastin' Time\\". In 1979, Prism was back in the studio to record their third album, Armageddon and needed help with songwriting. Since the departure of Vallance (Rodney Higgs), the current lineup was unable to fill the songwriting void adequately. Vallance brought his new protege, Adams, along to help. Adams wrote or co-wrote 3 songs for the album and played guitar on one track. \\"Take It Or Leave It\\" was credited as \\"B. Adams/R. Higgs\\" since Vallance wanted to identify with his Prism fans by using his pseudonym. Vallance then produced Franco-Ontarian band CANO's Rendezvous that summer. Vallance then landed another contract through Bruce Fairbairn to write songs for Ian Lloyd in 1980 and again in 1982. In total, 6 Adams-Vallance compositions were used by Lloyd and another 4 were collaborations between Vallance and Lloyd's band. In between, Vallance worked as a session and club musician, and took a job as the drummer for Tom Jones' TV show produced out of Vancouver. Also, in 1981, Vallance co-produced (along with the band) the second album by Vancouver's Doug and the Slugs, Wrap It!. Vallance also continued to work as an arranger and co-songwriter for other acts, working with Toronto on an unreleased track called \\"What About Love\\" in 1982, which would eventually become a huge hit for the band Heart. In 1982, Vallance and Adams received a call from producer Michael James Jackson inquiring about contributing songs for the next Kiss album. Although Vallance and Adams were not heavy metal fans, it was a golden opportunity for exposure for their songs by a world class rock act. With outside collaboration from Gene Simmons, \\"War Machine\\" and a re-written \\"Rock 'n Roll Hell\\" were recorded for Kiss' Creatures of the Night release that year. Later, Bonnie Raitt who heard a demo of their song \\"No Way To Treat A Lady\\" decided to record it. Between 1980 and 1982, Adams recorded and released his first two solo albums, self-titled Bryan Adams and You Want It You Got It. Vallance doubled as co-producer on the first. Although neither album was a big success, Adams' extensive touring helped him garner a lot of recognition as an artist. The Adams-Vallance songwriting team was starting to gain momentum.  Cuts Like a Knife & Breakthrough  Cuts Like a Knife was Adams' breakthrough album. Released in 1983, it established him as a legitimate North American music star (the album did not chart in Europe.) It also established the Adams-Vallance songwriting team in the music industry as other artists started to consider their songs seriously. The album spun 3 singles: \\"Straight from the Heart\\", \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\" and \\"This Time\\". \\"I'm Ready\\", \\"The Only One\\" and \\"Take Me Back\\" also received airplay. Ironically, \\"Straight from the Heart\\" was the highest charting of the three and is not a Vallance composition. It was written by Vancouver singer/songwriter Eric Kagna, with Adams adding the instrumental bridge, and credited as Adams-Kagna. The others were Adams-Vallance compositions. The album Cuts Like a Knife was certified three times platinum in Canada and certified one time platinum in the US. At the Canadian Juno music awards, \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\" and \\"Straight from the Heart\\" were nominated for a Single of the Year award, while \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\" won the Composer of the Year award for Adams-Vallance.  Reckless & Rise to the Top  Just as Cuts Like a Knife made him a star, Reckless made Adams an international superstar. And it did the same for the Adams-Vallance songwriting team. By the end 1985 Reckless had spun off 6 singles and was selling millions of copies worldwide. Adams-Vallance was now considered one of the top songwriting acts in the music industry. No longer did they have to forward demos to artists hoping they would consider them as now their agents were contacting Adams- Vallance requesting their services. The Adams-Vallance team wrote songs for artists such as Paul Dean, Kiss, Bonnie Raitt and many others. After sharing Juno Awards as composer of the year with Adams in 1984 and 1985, Vallance won two awards alone in 1986 and 1987. He was co-recipient with Adams of PRO Canada's William Harold Moon Award for international achievement in 1985.  Northern Lights for Africa  Vallance was involved in the Northern Lights for Africa famine relief cause in 1985 as co-writer and executive producer of the song, Tears Are Not Enough. David Foster had been contacted by Quincy Jones, producer of the USA for Africa ensemble, asking him if he could the same by Canadian artists. The American artists had just recorded theirs and were interested in including one by the Canadian artists on the album. Foster accepted and immediately approached Vallance who he knew was working out of the same studio at that time. Although Foster and Vallance knew each other through the music industry, they had never collaborated on a song before this. Foster arrived at Vallance's home the next day and the two worked on the music in Vallance's home studio. Foster had to leave that evening to return to the studio and left the lyrics to Vallance. Rachel Paiement, Vallance's wife, wrote the French lyrics as she is Franco-Ontarian and a songwriter in her own right. Bryan Adams returned from touring the following day to help complete the lyrics. The title was taken from an unrelated, unrecorded song by Bob Rock and Paul Hyde of the Canadian band The Payola$ who Foster was producing at the time. The songwriting is credited to Foster, Vallance, Adams, Paiement, Rock & Hyde. The recording with the grand ensemble of Canadian artists took place on February 10, 1985 at Manta Studios in Toronto, Ontario. Vallance played the drums on the recording. Vallance was credited as executive producer for recording Bruce Cockburn's part in a studio in Hamburg, Germany.\\"Tears Are Not Enough\\", Jim Vallance Discography  Breakup & Reconciliation  During 1989, the Adams-Vallance songwriting partnership became strained to the point that it was dissolved. The team was under intense pressure from the record company to follow up Reckless. Instead they delivered Into the Fire, which was poorly received by critics, and although it sold several million copies, compared to \\"Reckless\\" it was a commercial disappointment. Meanwhile, Vallance had just become a father and his lifestyle had changed considerably. Also, Adams complained that Vallance was coming back to the partnership burnt out from writing and producing songs with other artists and insisted that if they were to continue at the level they had been at, Vallance should put other projects on hold until they had another album. Vallance complied with Adams' request but after several failed attempts to write and record what Adams felt was suitable material, Vallance informed Adams that he no longer wanted to work with him and the Adams-Vallance partnership went into hiatus.Interview with Bryan Adams Fan Club Netherlands (February 2004), Jim Vallance Interviews Adams and Vallance were essentially estranged for some time, with only sporadic contact. In 2003, Adams approached Vallance inquiring if he would like to co-write a few songs for his next album. Vallance agreed and 3 songs on Adams' album 11 are credited with Vallance as co-writer. Adams then approached him to write the Olympic song with him and another Olympic song for ARD TV in Germany. This was to be their reinvention.  Glass Tiger  Following the release of Reckless, Vallance worked with a new Canadian band Glass Tiger. Initially hired to help with arrangements, the band eventually asked Vallance to produce their debut album. Vallance co-wrote such hits as \\"Someday\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)\\", which won the Canadian music industry Juno award for 1986 Single of the Year. Following Glass Tiger's second album, Vallance declined offers to produce future albums. He cited the long hours and tedious work as reasons. He had more enjoyment in just the songwriting and arranging.  Aerosmith  In 1986, Aerosmith was a band in turmoil. Their previous album Done with Mirrors went below the radar in sales and airplay. To make matters worse, band members' alcohol and drug habits were causing problems. Geffen Records would only fund their next recording provided all the bandmembers complete drug and alcohol rehab which they did. After listening to the demos, the record company did not believe there was any material that would get them airplay. A second condition was then placed on them and that was to have outside songwriters to work with the band members. Initially, band members were not warm to the idea. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Vallance helped to write several songs with the band, including some of the hit singles \\"Rag Doll\\" (1987), \\"Hangman Jury\\" (1987), \\"The Other Side\\" (1989), \\"Eat the Rich\\" (1993), and \\"Deuces are Wild\\" (1994), in addition to several other Aerosmith songs. He also co-wrote the single \\"Legendary Child\\", which was initially written in 1991, and then later re- worked and released in 2012 as the lead single on Music from Another Dimension!.  Awards  Vallance has been awarded or honored with over 35 SOCAN and Procan Classics and related awards, as well as awards from BMI, and ASCAP. Vallance served on the boards of PROCAN (1985‚Äì90); SOCAN (1996-8, 2000-3, 2006-9); FACTOR (1985-7); and the Songwriters Association of Canada in 2008, and the latter's advisory board 1998-2008. In 2003, Vallance won an International Achievement Award for the song \\"Heaven\\" at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto. In 2007, Vallance was appointed to the Order of Canada and invested in 2008.  Personal life  Vallance married singer-songwriter Rachel Paiement in the early 1980s. Paiement is a former member of the groups CANO and Morgan. She is an accomplished singer-songwriter in her own right. They have one child, Jimmy, who was a house DJ during his high school years and is currently an electronic musician for house/alternative band Bob Moses.

In 2010, Ma-Yi Theater received a Special Drama Desk Award for Excellence. Savage Stage: Plays by Ma-Yi Theater Company is an anthology of selected new works developed and produced by the company since its founding. Edited by Ma-Yi's Literary Manager, Joi Barrios, Savage Stage was published in 2007. Ma-Yi Theater Company is a participant in \\"Artography: Arts in a Changing America\\", a pilot program launched by LINC (Leveraging Investments In Creativity) that seeks to map new arts practices in the United States resulting from demographic shifts.  History  Ma-Yi did not start out to be an Asian American theatre company. Founded in 1989 by Chito Jao Garces (artistic director), Ralph Pena, Margot Lloren, Ankie Frilles, Luz de Leon, Isolda Oca, Arianne Recto, Cristina Sison, and Bernie Villanueva, its first productions were Filipino and Filipino-American plays and adaptations. Also instrumental in the founding of Ma-Yi was Chris Millado, who served as advisor to their first performance and returned to write and direct for the group. Jorge Ortoll joined the company a year later in 1990, and became its executive director in 1991, the same year that Ma-Yi became a non-profit company and established a Board of Directors. Ralph Pe√±a and Betty Mae Piccio became co-artistic directors in 1995, and when Piccio moved to Philadelphia in 1996, Pe√±a became its sole artistic director. Ortoll and Pe√±a have since organized a support staff that has included Lourdes Obillo as accountant, Vince Hokia as technical director, Daniel Rech as marketing manager, and Andrew Eisenmann and Suzette Porte as associate artistic directors. Since its inception, Ma-Yi has benefited from the involvement of Filipino theatre artists based in New York, including production designer and director Loy Arcenas, composer Fabian Obispo, veteran actors Ching Valdez-Aran and Mia Katigbak, and novelist and playwright Jessica Hagedorn. Other Filipino artists and writers have also been involved with Ma-Yi, such as director Behn Cervantes; playwright and actor Rody Vera; playwright Marina Feleo-Gonzalez; National Artist of the Philippines for Literature Bienvenido Lumbera and Virgilio Almario; scholars Preachy Legasto, Nicanor Tiongson, and Roland Tolentino; and choreographer-dancer Potri Rangkamanis. In 2003, while in the United States as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of California Irvine, Joi Barrios joined the group as its Literary Manager. In 1998, Ma-Yi Theater expanded its mission to include works by other, non- Filipino, Asian American writers. This move was largely prodded by the company's recognition of the need for more developmental venues for new Asian American plays. Some of Ma-Yi Theater's recent productions include Sides: The Fear is Real, The Romance of Magno Rubio (Obie Award), No Foreigners Beyond This Point (Drama Desk nomination), and Trial By Water. The Ma-Yi Writers Lab was founded in 2004 by Sung Rno in connection with the TCG/NEA Playwright's Residence Program, and is currently led by Co-Directors Michael Lew and Rehana Lew Mirza. The Lab is Ma-Yi's resident company of emerging professional writers, and represents the largest group of professional Asian American playwrights ever assembled. In 2005, the Ma-Yi Theater was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. In November 2015, Ma-Yi Theater Group member and playwright Lloyd Suh asked that a student production of his play Jesus in India be shut down at Pennsylvania's Clarion University because the school ignored the play's requirement of using South Asian actors. This race controversy has been widely reported in the national press.http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/11/14/playwright-forces-public- university-to-cancel-15k-production-of-his-play-after-he-saw-student-actors- race/ It was later found that Clarion University had never secured the playwright's permission to use his play, much less adapt it into a musical, although it had been cleared by the author's agent. Absent a signed contract, Clarion University proceeded to change the material and schedule a public performance that the author only found out about through social media.

The summit is located in the town of Blooming Grove, with other portions in Cornwall and Woodbury. The community of Mountain Lodge Park is built up its western slope. The mountain is a popular recreational resource in the area. While only the northeastern quadrant and summit are part of the recently created Schunnemunk State Park, some popular hiking trails and access routes have long crossed the privately owned lands elsewhere on the mountain. Conservationists hope that eventually the state will be able to acquire the whole mountain. Geography This view of Schunemunk from the west shows the full length of the ridge. Schunemunk is a long ridge running approximately northeast-southwest between Smith's Clove and Salisbury Mills. Along the more northerly of its length, the mountain has a double crest, with Barton Swamp lying between the two ridges. The summit lies on the more southeasterly ridge. Barton Swamp is drained by Perry Creek on the south and Baby Brook on the north. Much of the eastern side of the mountain is drained by Dark Hollow Brook. These are part of the Moodna Creek watershed, which encompasses all but the southeastern tip of the mountain. Moodna Creek drains into the Hudson River. The southeastern part of the mountain drains into the watershed of the Ramapo River. About midway along its length, on the southeastern side of the mountain, is a spur known as High Knob or High Point, which overlooks Woodbury, New York. To the northwest, across a clove, lies Woodcock Mountain or Woodcock Hill, which reaches . The New York State Thruway runs alongside Schunemunk's eastern side for the length of the mountain just north of its Harriman exit. In addition to Mountain Lodge Park, two other hamlets in the area are closely associated with the mountain: Mountainville to the northeast and Central Valley to the southeast. Due to its height and length, Schunemunk can be seen from much of the rest of Orange County and some other nearby areas. Conglomerate and scrub pine on the summit ridges. Geology Schunemunk is geologically dissimilar from nearby mountains in the Hudson Highlands, being formed from sedimentary deposits including conglomerate. Later faulting created the long cleft that is now Barton Swamp. History The name \\"Schunemunk\\" means \\"excellent fireplace\\" in Lenape, and the Lenni Lenape had a village on the northern tip of the mountain. During the American Revolution, the mountain was often the site of skirmishing between Tory and Patriot irregulars. The mountain is under increasing development pressure, but the northern part has become Schunnemunk State Park, and a small portion of the southern part forms Woodbury Park. Summit, with elevation chalked on nearby rock. Trails The Long Path ascends the mountain by way of High Knob, and crosses Perry Creek. When it reaches the Jessup and Highland trails it joins them to Gonzaga Park. The Highlands Trail makes use of several trails on the mountain, ascending the eastern side of the mountain along the Sweet Clover Trail, and following the more southeasterly ridge and crossing the summit by way of the Jessup Trail, which continues along the crest to the southwestern tip of the mountain, ending in Gonzaga Park. The Dark Hollow, Barton Swamp, Trestle, Western Ridge, and Otterkill trails are also located on the mountain. Fatality While Schunemunk, like many of the lesser mountains of the American East Coast, is relatively devoid of the usual mountaineering hazards, one fatality has occurred in the recent past. On May 22, 2002, a group of hikers was bushwhacking on a boulder field on the southeastern side of the mountain, above Dark Hollow Brook. Nicholas Styranovski of Astoria, NY had passed the boulder field and gone back to help some of his fellow hikers who were less steady at about noon on May 22, state police said. The field was part of a pre-existing rock slide where boulders came to rest after falling down a steeper slope, said Edward Goodell, the executive director of the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference, an organization that helps maintain the area's hiking paths. A large boulder came loose from above and hit Styranovski and four others, police said. The informal hiking group ‚Äì known as the Wednesday Hikers ‚Äì conducts weekly outings to the Appalachian Mountains and other regional hiking trails, Goodell said. As they hike they discuss their plans for the next week's hikes, he said. Although the ages and experience levels of the members vary, they are mostly retired people who are skilled hikers, he said. https://qns.com/story/2002/05/29/long-island-city-man-killed- on-hiking-trip/ ‚ÄúThey are a great group of people,‚Äù Goodell said. ‚ÄúThey love nature and they get out there and they have had incident-free hikes for about 30 years.‚Äù The mistake these hikers made was to get spread out with some hikers significantly above others on a field of loose rock so that if a rock was knocked loose it was able to gain enough momentum to injure. Had they all been at the same level a loose rock would be unlikely to hurt someone.https://www.mountaineers.org/blog/how-to-navigate-loose-rock References * New York‚ÄìNew Jersey Trail Conference Trail Map 8, West Hudson Trails: Schunemunk Mountain Category:Mountains of New York (state) Category:Mountains of Orange County, New York Category:Palisades Interstate Park system Category:Nature Conservancy preserves in New York (state) ","title":"Schunemunk Mountain"},{"id":"3940793","text":"Tah-won-ne-ahs or Thaonawyuthe (born between 1737 and 1760, died December 26, 1859), known in English as either Governor Blacksnake or Chainbreaker, was a Seneca war chief and leader. Along with other Iroquois war chiefs (most notably Mohawk leader Joseph Brant), he led warriors to fight on the side of the British during the American Revolutionary War from 1777 to 1783. He was prominent for his role at the Battle of Oriskany, in which the Loyalist and allied forces ambushed a force of rebels (now called Patriots). After the war he supported his maternal uncle Handsome Lake, as a prominent religious leader. Governor Blacksnake allied with the United States in the War of 1812 and later encouraged some accommodation to European-American settlers, allowing missionaries and teachers on the Seneca reservation. Importantly, he also led a successful postwar struggle in New York in the 1850s after white men illegally bought reservation land. He helped gain a New York State Appeals Court ruling in 1861 that restored the Oil Springs Reservation to the Seneca. Early life Governor Blacksnake was born near Seneca Lake in western New York in the Seneca/Cayuga village of Kendaia (Apple Town). His mother was a Seneca woman of the Wolf clan and his father was known as De-ne-oh-ah-te or \\"The Light\\". In the matrilineal kinship system of the Iroquois nations, a child is born into his or her mother's clan and gains social status from her family. The maternal uncles were very influential in the child's life, especially the oldest brother of the mother. He was raised in Canawaugus, a Seneca village known as Ga:non'wag√™s (in the Seneca language), on the east side of the Genesee River. (The site has been absorbed into the village of Avon, Livingston County, New York). The war chief Cornplanter and sachem Handsome Lake were his maternal uncles and also lived at Ga:non'wag√™s. The Wolf Clan's traditional function for males of the Seneca was to serve as war chiefs. His birth date has been given variously from circa 1760 to as early as 1737 (as is claimed on his gravestone, which was erected in 1930; the gravestone also erroneously states that he supported the Continental Army during the Revolution). A 1737 birthdate would have made him 121 or 122 years old at the time of death; historians do not believe this is likely, as only one other person, Jeanne Calment, has ever been documented to have lived more than 120 years. Chainbreaker was known to live an exceptionally long life, perhaps reaching the age of 100. He likely became recognized as a war chief for actions as a young adult. According to Draper, Blacksnake said he was two years old at the time of William Johnson's defeat of the French on Lake George in 1755, and 22 at the time of the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. His death on December 26, 1859 was well documented. In his youth, Chainbreaker accompanied his uncle Cornplanter \\"on special missions to see General George Washington as well as to members of the Continental Congress\\". After the Revolutionary War, in 1788 Chainbreaker moved to the large area of land in Pennsylvania granted to his uncle Cornplanter for his service by the state legislature, after his home village (Canawaugus) was sold to the United States in the Phelps and Gorham Purchase of Seneca lands. Converted to his uncle Handsome Lake's religion, Chainbreaker became an active promoter of traditional ways. In 1803 he moved with Handsome Lake to nearby Coldspring, after a dispute with Cornplanter. While Blacksnake continued to advocate \\"temperance, morality, and adherence to the overall principles of Handsome Lake,\\" he rejected his uncle's \\"proscription against Indian participation in the 'white man's wars\\". By the 1840s Blacksnake had formulated his own version of his uncle's traditional ways. He generally urged finding a path of compromise. He permitted missionaries and Western schooling on the Reservation and encouraged his followers to work toward social harmony and to take advantage of schooling. Involvement in regional warfare In 1777 Blacksnake took part in the siege of Fort Stanwix and the Battle of Oriskany in British General St. Leger's part of the Saratoga campaign. In 1778 he participated in the Battle of Wyoming under the command of Colonel John Butler. In 1779 he attempted to defend Seneca settlements against the raid of Colonel Daniel Brodhead. Blacksnake carried messages for the British on a trail that passed through today's Napoli, New York. After his work on behalf of the British in the Revolutionary War, Chainbreaker became reconciled to the United States establishing independence and forcing the Seneca and other Iroquois from most of their lands. He volunteered to fight on the American side in the War of 1812, and participated in the Battle of Fort George. Struggle for Oil Spring Reservation Photograph of Governor Blacksnake, (Tha-o-na-wyuthe) or (\\"Tha o-wa-nyuths,\\") \\"The Nephew\\" (Seneca). Governor Blacksnake \\"helped save the Oil Spring Reserve\\" for the Seneca. His victory in this New York State court case established a precedent for the land claim settled in June 2005 over Cuba Lake. After the war, European Americans Stanley Clark, Benjamin Chamberlain, and William Gallagher bought lands adjacent to the Seneca Oil Spring Reservation. On behalf of these three men, Clark surveyed Reservation lands and claimed the area, granting one-quarter of the reservation to Horatio Seymour, later elected as governor of New York. In the 1850s, Clark conveyed another quarter to Philonius Pattison. In response to these actions, the Seneca filed a legal challenge that reached the New York Court of Appeals, Seneca Nation of Indians v. Philonus Pattison. They protested against the Seymour, Gallagher, Chamberlain, and Clark claims to the northeast quarter of Oil Spring. Governor Blacksnake, who had attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Big Tree that established the reservation, testified that he and Joseph Ellicott had surveyed the Oil Spring lands and that the omission of a full legal description of the lands from the treaty was a mistake. He produced a map copied by the Holland Land Company, in which the Oil Spring Reservation was marked similarly to other Seneca lands. In 1861, the Court found for the Seneca Nation. Pattison, Chamberlain, Clark, Gallagher, and Seymour were forced to leave the reservation. While later incursions by the New York State Board of Canal Commissioners and tourist activities have taken additional land from the Reservation, Governor Blacksnake's actions helped preserve some of Oil Spring as Seneca land. Later life In later life, Chainbreaker's political influence waned, as younger Seneca men assumed control. But he continued to participate in the Iroquois Condolence Council into his nineties. Blacksnake died on the Allegany Reservation in Cattaraugus County, New York in late December 1859. He is remembered by the Seneca Nation as \\"a man of rare intellectual and moral power.\\" NotesReferences  *  External links  * Tenh-Wen-Nyos, Governor Blacksnake at Find-a-Grave * Governor Blacksnake Manuscript Page * Poem: Governor Blacksnake Speaks * , contains information on Governor Blacksnake and the Senecas of the Cornplanter Grant * Category:Seneca people Category:Native Americans in the American Revolution Category:Native American leaders Category:Native American people of the Indian Wars Category:Native Americans in the War of 1812 Category:Native American writers Category:People from Cattaraugus County, New York Category:18th- century births Category:1859 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:18th-century Native Americans ","title":"Governor Blacksnake"},{"id":"3940807","text":"John Salath√© (June 14, 1899 ‚Äì 1993) was an American pioneering rock climber, blacksmith, and the inventor of the modern piton. Early life Salath√© was born in Switzerland and emigrated to the United States. He had been a blacksmith before an illness and a mid-life spiritual conversion led him to devote his life to ascetic meditation, vegetarianism and rock climbing. Lost Arrow pitons When he began climbing in 1945, he found that traditional pitons used for climbing in the Alps were too soft to be driven into narrow cracks without buckling. In his San Mateo business, Peninsula Wrought Iron Works, Salath√© used high-carbon chrome-vanadium steel, similar to that used to make Ford axles, to forge extremely strong pitons which could be hammered into the hard Yosemite granite without buckling, as well as removed without getting mangled, thus rendering them reusable. These thin pitons became known as Lost Arrows, and are still manufactured under that name by Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. Ascents In 1946, Salath√© and Anton (Ax) Nelson climbed the southwest face of Half Dome. The two climbers spent the night on a small ledge, making it Yosemite's first climbing route to require a bivouac. In September, 1947, Salath√© and Nelson managed the first \\"ground-up\\" ascent of the Lost Arrow Spire in Yosemite, by the Lost Arrow Chimney route. The Lost Arrow piton was named after the spire. The ascent took five days and included four bivouacs. The first ascent of the spire summit was achieved in 1946 by Anton Nelson and friends, who threw a rope over the summit beforehand to aid in their climb. In July, 1950, Allen Steck and Salath√© made the first ascent of the 1,500 foot (500 m) north face of Sentinel Rock. This five-day ascent was considered the last of the great Yosemite problems of the day. Their route, the Steck-Salath√© Route is now a classic rock climb. Later life In 1953, Salath√© suffered a mental breakdown, abandoned his family, and returned to Switzerland. He became a devoted member of a religious group called the Spiritual Lodge Zurich. He climbed the Matterhorn in August, 1958, his last significant mountaineering achievement. In 1963, he returned to the United States and spent 20 years wandering through the mountains and deserts of California, maintaining his vegetarian diet based largely on wild grasses and herbs that he sought out, and preaching his religious beliefs. Death and legacy Salath√© died on August 31, 1992. The Salath√© Wall on El Capitan was named to honor Salath√© (although he did not climb it) around 1960 by Royal Robbins.

It is the home stadium to a number of local area high school football teams, as well as Long Beach City College's football team. It was also home to Long Beach State's football team until the program disbanded in 1991. The stadium is also popular as a movie set for a number of Hollywood motion pictures. It also hosted the 1985 and 1988 Motorcycle Speedway World Team Cup Finals. History Veterans Stadium opened in 1950, and was owned by the City of Long Beach for nearly four decades. The city used the stadium as a temporary location for Fire Station 19 (now located on Clark Avenue, a few blocks away). The fire station was housed at the south end of the stadium under the bleacher area; the large door that was installed for the fire engine to exit can still be seen. The actual \\"station\\", or living quarters area, is now used as an office for stadium personnel. Two years before the Vet was opened, pro football came to Long Beach when the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League became the Long Beach Bulldogs for the 1948 season.The End of the PCPFL ‚Äì Bob Gill, Pro Football Research Association (1983) But the minor-league PCPFL was on its last legs by this time, and so were the Bulldogs‚Äîa legendary West Coast team that had fallen on hard times since the NFL Los Angeles Rams and the AAFC's Los Angeles Dons moved to town. After drawing just 850 fans for a Bulldogs game at Stephen's Field on the campus of Wilson High School in Long Beach on October 17, 1948, the team promptly cancelled the rest of their schedule, and the PCPFL folded soon after. Finally, in 1967, the Vet hosted a professional football team: the Long Beach Admirals were admitted to the Continental Football League as part of the league's expansion to the west coast. But the Admirals wouldn't last long: they drew only 2,475 fans for an exhibition game, then just 950 customers for their regular season opener, a 37-13 loss to the Seattle Rangers. After the disastrous gates, the team applied for an immediate transfer to Portland, Oregon; this was denied, and the Admirals sank beneath the waves. In 1987, Long Beach City College acquired Veterans Stadium from the City of Long Beach, and in the 1990s, the college upgraded the stadium for use by local high school football teams. One of the most memorable football contests held at the stadium involved Long Beach Polytechnic High School and Lakewood High School, drawing over 11,500 spectators and regional television coverage. Veterans Stadium is currently the home stadium to the Long Beach Poly Jackrabbits and the Los Alamitos High School Griffins. =Speedway= During the 1980s the stadium also doubled as a Motorcycle speedway venue. The speedway track was laid out over the stadiums existing athletics track with additional banking in the corners to allow for faster racing. As well as hosting the World Team Cup Final in 1985 and 1988 (both won by Denmark with the USA finishing second), the stadium played host to numerous American Finals which were then qualifying rounds for the Speedway World Championship during the decade. Some of the riders to have raced at the stadium include Individual World Champions Bruce Penhall and Sam Ermolenko (USA), Erik Gundersen and Hans Nielsen (Denmark), Per Jonsson (Sweden) and Gary Havelock (England), as well as a host of top class riders such as Americans Shawn and Kelly Moran, Bobby Schwartz and Scott Autrey. Veterans is also the site where Dennis Sigalos ended his career with a badly broken leg following a crash in the 1984 American Final. =Rugby League= Probably the most historically notable football contest at this stadium involved a completely different code‚Äîrugby league. In 1987, after the three regular matches in the Australian State of Origin series between the states of Queensland and New South Wales, the two teams went to Long Beach for a fourth match, drawing an announced crowd of 12,439 to see New South Wales win 30‚Äì18. The canonicity of the match has been in dispute ever since. While all Australian authorities count the match for purposes of individual player statistics, not all of them include it in official team records. Sources in New South Wales, including the Australian Rugby League and its successor, the Australian Rugby League Commission, officially count the match result; those within the Queensland Rugby League do not. In 2004, Veterans Stadium received another upgrade. A new SprinTurf playing surface replaced the old playing surface in time for the 2004 football season. =Soccer= Veterans Memorial Stadium hosted a match in the 1958 FIFA World Cup qualification; Mexico routed the United States, 7-2, in front of 12,500. About Veterans Stadium=The basics= Veterans Stadium seats 11,600, and are on one side of the stadium, a grandstand facing east. 7,000 of the seats are aluminum bench bleachers, with the other 4,600 seats having fixed chairbacks. The field is surrounded by a nine-lane, 400-meter track. =Location= The stadium is located on Lew Davis Street between Clark Avenue and Faculty Avenue. It is three miles west of Interstate 605 (use the Carson Street exit) and two miles north of Interstate 405 (use the Lakewood Boulevard exit or the Bellflower Boulevard exit). =Technical information= The field is open at both ends and there is a practice field on the north side and a large parking lot on the south side. There are large locker rooms for both home and visiting teams in the stadium and a smaller room for game officials. There are lights for night play using metal-halide lamps on eight towers. Veterans Stadium also features a two-level press box (capacity 100) atop the west grandstand. Spectator amenities include 4,000 surface parking spaces, two ticket booths with two windows each, three permanent concessions, and a combined message board and scoreboard.

For the song, see \\"Living My Life\\". Living My Life is the autobiography of Lithuanian-born anarchist Emma Goldman, who became internationally renowned as an activist based in the United States. It was published in two volumes in 1931 (Alfred A. Knopf) and 1934 (Garden City Publishing Company). Goldman wrote it while living in Saint- Tropez, France, following her disillusionment with the Bolshevik role in the Russian revolution. The text thoroughly covers her personal and political life from early childhood through to 1927. The book has constantly remained in print since, in original and abridged editions. Since the autobiography was published nine years before Goldman died in 1940, it does not record her role in the Spanish Civil War.  Background  Emma Goldman was born in 1869 in Kovno, Lithuania (then Russian Empire). Her parents Abraham and Taube owned a modest inn but were generally impoverished. Throughout her childhood and early adolescence, Goldman traveled between her parents' home in Lithuania and her grandmother's home in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia before the family relocated to St. Petersburg. Though much of her childhood was unhappy, as her father was often abusive, Goldman was close with her older half-sister Helena and valued the modest schooling she received. In 1885, Goldman immigrated with Helena to Rochester, New York to join their sister Lena and escape the influence of her father; he wanted to make an arranged marriage for her. Despite finding work in a clothing factory, Goldman did not stay in Rochester long. Enraged by the execution of the Haymarket bombers in 1887, she moved to New York and became one of the nation's most renowned anarchists.  Summary  Emma Goldman in 1886 Goldman begins Living My Life with her arrival in New York City on August 8, 1889‚Äîthe day she said she began her life as an anarchist. She does not express her autobiography chronologically, as she considered her first twenty years to be something of a previous life. As Goldman recalls, \\"All that had happened in my life until that time was now left behind me, cast off like a worn-out garment.\\" Living My Life reflects upon Goldman's time prior to New York as a means of explaining her principles and conversion to anarchy. For instance, she describes her employment in a Rochester clothing factory as an introduction to her antagonism toward industrial labor. Goldman claimed to work ten and a half hours a day and earned $2.50 a week, not unusual for the time. After she asked the owner for a raise, she was rebuffed; she left to find work elsewhere. Feeling alone in America, in 1887 Goldman \\"consented\\" to marry Jacob Kershner, a fellow Jewish immigrant. This marriage, however, would not survive long. While Goldman attributes her husband's disinterest in books and his growing interest in gambling toward their antagonism, the realization of his impotence was the breaking point for Goldman. She recalled being left in \\"utter bewilderment\\" on her wedding night. Goldman recalls being \\"saved from utter despair\\" in Rochester only by her fascination with the events at Haymarket and her subsequent move to New York City. Goldman's memoir describes her first months in New York City fondly. The book vividly describes her efforts to meet Johann Most, the notorious German anarchist and editor of the newspaper Die Freiheit. Most, after the first meeting, became her mentor. Goldman's recollections heavily imply that Most was determined to craft her into a \\"great speaker,\\" one that could take his place as a leader for \\"the Cause.\\" It was during her unofficial tutelage that Goldman began public speaking. Beginning first by stumping in New York City, Goldman expanded her skills and departed shortly thereafter on a lecture tour of Cleveland, Buffalo, and her family's home of Rochester. One of the key moments of Living my Life was Goldman's fateful encounter with a young Jewish anarchist named Alexander \\"Sasha\\" Berkman. The two met on Goldman's first day in New York and quickly became close friends and lovers. While Goldman credits both Most and Berkman with influencing her belief in anarchism, Living My Life positions Berkman and Most as rivals for Goldman's personal affections. Goldman recalls being courted by both men and being drawn to both in different ways: \\"The charm of Most was upon me. His eagerness for life, for friendship, moved me deeply. And Berkman, too, appealed to me profoundly. His earnestness, his self-confidence, his youth‚Äîeverything about him drew me with irresistible force.\\"Goldman, Living My Life, 36. Goldman with Alexander \\"Sasha\\" Berkman circa 1917 These thoughts were indicative of Goldman's ruminations regarding \\"free love\\" a persistent theme throughout the memoir. Maintaining that \\"binding people for life was wrong,\\" Goldman carried on romantic affairs with Berkman, but rejected the advances of Most. In reflection, Goldman determines that Most \\"cared for women only as females\\" and ultimately \\"broke\\" with her because he wanted women \\"who have no other interest in life but the man they love and the children they bear him.\\"Goldman, Living My Life, 72‚Äì73, 77. Following her break with Most, Goldman continues her work by describing her complicity in an attempt to murder Henry Clay Frick, chairman of Carnegie Steel Company, in 1892. Goldman lived with Berkman in New England when they heard news of the Homestead Strike, which had erupted at one of Carnegie's Pittsburg area steel mills. Frick's attempts to violently repress the strikers enraged Berkman and Goldman who quickly devised a plan for Frick's assassination. Living My Life describes how Goldman was motivated by the doctrine of \\"Propaganda by Deed\\" in Most's Science of Revolutionary Warfare, which supported political violence as a tool of the anarchist. She recounted her belief that Frick's death would \\"re-echo in the poorest hovel, would call the attention of the whole world to the real cause behind the Homestead struggle.\\"Goldman, Living My Life, 87. In her account, the couple agreed that Berkman would travel to Homestead and sacrifice himself for the Cause, while Goldman would remain in New York to raise funds and deliver speeches in the wake of the assassination. To demonstrate her devotion to conspiracy, Goldman details how she had even considered prostitution to raise $15 needed for Berkman's travels before agreeing to accept a loan from her sister with the pretense of her being ill.Goldman, Living My Life, 92. Living My Life describes the aftermath of the attempted assassination as a difficult time in Goldman's life. Berkman failed in his attempt to assassinate Frick, who survived his wounds. In fact, Berkman was not, as expected, killed after the attack but was sentenced to twenty-two years in prison. Furthermore, rather than receiving praise from her anarchist comrades, Most condemned Berkman and reversed his opinion on \\"Propaganda by Deed.\\" Goldman writes that she was so infuriated by the \\"betrayal\\" of Most that she publicly horsewhipped her former mentor at a public rally. The failed assassination attempt deeply divided the anarchist movement and Goldman found herself labelled a \\"pariah\\" by supporters of Most. Goldman's penchant for radicalism and inspired speaking grew in the wake of the Homestead strike and subsequently resulted in increased police attention, resulting in her arrest in Philadelphia under charges of inciting to riot in August 1893. Following a description of her year in prison and her later travels in Western Europe, the memoir examines Goldman's return to lecturing for the anarchist cause in the late 1890s. Lecturing in Cleveland in 1900, Goldman recalls being approached by a young man who gave the name \\"Nieman.\\" Responding to the young man's interest in anarchist literature, she gladly gave him a reading list and thought nothing strange of the event. It was soon discovered that Nieman was the alias of Leon Czolgosz, the assassin who fatally shot President McKinley in September 1901. Goldman, implicated as an accomplice in the assassination, was arrested in Chicago. Though held in contempt by the American public and badly beaten during a prison transfer, Goldman was released due to lack of evidence. Leon Czolgosz while imprisoned for the assassination of President McKinley. Goldman's autobiography depicts the repercussions of McKinley's assassination as long lasting and severe. Despite being acquitted of all charges, Goldman's association with Czolgosz made her a pariah to anarchist and non-anarchist alike. Despite her wrongful imprisonment, Goldman stood by Czolgosz and sought to discover his justification for the assassination. Goldman reflects that although Czolgosz's action was misguided, she \\"was not willing to swear away the reason, character, or life of a defenseless human being.\\" Goldman attempted to enlist anarchist support in a campaign to hire Czolgosz an attorney‚Äîin order to give him a chance to \\"explain his act to the world.\\" Few, however, showed willingness to associate with the assassin. Her belief in the movement was shaken. As Goldman suggests, many of her comrades had \\"been flaunting anarchism like a red cloth before a bull, but they had [run] to cover at its first charge.\\" Despite these difficulties, Goldman established her own radical newspaper, Mother Earth in 1907. Throughout the following decade, Goldman describes her political associations with the recently released Alexander Berkman to protest US preparedness, political repression, restrictions on homosexuality and birth control. The memoir devotes particular attention to Goldman's view of homosexuality. Goldman writes, recalling an interaction with a woman who confessed to her feelings of \\"homosexuality,\\" \\"To me anarchism was not a mere theory for a distant future; it was a living influence to free us from inhibitions‚Ä¶ and from the destructive barriers that separate man from man.\\" Her increased attention as the result of these speaking engagements led to greater attention from law enforcement. Goldman was arrested under the Comstock Act following a speech on birth control in 1915, but was shortly thereafter released. Living My Life continues by discussing Goldman's efforts to counter-act military preparedness and the draft‚Äîespecially the 1917 arrest of both Goldman and Berkman. The two were arrested on charges of encouraging men to avoid conscription into the army. inspired by anti-War sentiment in the United States, Goldman and Berkman focused significant attention to anti- conscription articles in Mother Earth and held several anti-preparedness rallies. Following an unsuccessful appeal to the Supreme Court, the couple was sentenced to two years in prison and forced to pay a ten thousand dollar fine. The autobiography concludes with Goldman's exile in the Soviet Union. After serving their full sentences, both Goldman and Berkman were released in the midst of the first Red Scare and were subsequently deported to the newly formed Soviet Union. Although Goldman writes that she \\"longed\\" to return to her \\"native land\\" and aid in its reconstruction after the 1917 Revolutions, she \\"denied the right of the government\\" to force her. While Goldman was optimistic of the revolutionary workers state, upon arrival her optimism was shaken by the Bolshevik dictatorship and their means of violent repression and coercion. As stated in Living My Life: \\"[The dictatorship‚Äôs] role was somewhat different from the one proclaimed in public. It was forcible tax collection at the point of guns, with its devastating effect on villages and towns. It was the elimination ‚Ä¶ of everyone who dared think aloud, and the spiritual death of the most militant elements whose intelligence, faith, and courage had really enabled the Bolsheviki to achieve their power.\\" These feelings were compounded by the brutal repression of the Kronstadt sailors, who had rebelled under the pretense of anarchist principles. Issue of Mother Earth from 1906. Goldman concludes her memoir by describing her flight from Soviet Russia and her subsequent travels abroad. Securing a visa to leave the Soviet Union, Goldman and Berkman arrived in Latvia on December 1, 1921. The couple traveled between Germany, France, England, Sweden, and Canada on temporary visas. However, after being commissioned by the New York World, Goldman published a series of articles describing her experiences in Russia‚Äîthese articles would later be compiled into My Disillusionment in Russia.  Critical reception  Living My Life received a positive review from the New York Times, and generally a positive reception from members of radical circles. R.L. Duffus in the New York Times praised Goldman for the human portrayal of her \\"tempestuous\\" life. The most impressive aspect of Goldman's book, wrote Duffus, was the realization that what motivated Goldman was not \\"hatred\\" for the ruling classes, but \\"sympathy\\" for the masses. Extending this analysis to many of the other historical actors in Living My Life, Duffus concluded that perhaps the anarchists \\"hated authority because authority as they had known it had been neither kind nor just to them.\\" Describing Goldman as a \\"vanishing\\" species motivated to radicalism out of pure humanity, Duffus described Living My Life as \\"one of the great books of its kind.\\" In an anonymous \\"Letter to the Editor\\" published in the Washington Post, a writer compared Goldman's criticism of the Soviet Union to John Dewey's philosophy that \\"violence begets violence\\". They agreed with her insistence that progress could not be achieved through dictatorship. Some anarchists tried to settle personal issues. Helene Minkin, her former roommate and an anarchist in her own right, quickly published her memoirs in a serialized format in the Jewish daily newspaper Forverts (The Forward) in 1932. She wanted to defend her husband Johann Most, whom she had married in the 1890s, from Goldman's scathing criticism. Minkin rejected Goldman's statement that Most broke with Goldman and married Minkin because he wanted a wife who would take a domestic role. Minkin said she did not know the reason for the break between the two former friends (Most was originally a mentor to Goldman), but she said that her personal relationship with Most was neither subordinate nor traditional. Minkin described her role this way: > \\"Most, as I have noted once already, had the right to desire a little > happiness for himself in the midst of his bitter and turbulent struggle‚Ä¶ It > would often bother me when I saw that Most wobbled a bit on his pedestal, > and I supported him so that he wouldn‚Äôt be pushed down from his heights.\\"  Significance  Living My Life provides critical insight as to the mentality of radical immigrants in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Goldman personally explores the often neglected topics of political violence and the nature of human sexuality in the early anarchist movement. At the beginning of Goldman's autobiography, the Haymarket bombing was a recent memory and American anarchists had already been tied to notions of violence and assassination. As historian John Higham posits, after Haymarket, the immigrant was widely stereotyped by American nativists as \\"a lawless creature given over to violence and disorder.\\" Goldman's early narrative emphasizes the violent tendencies of the movement, as it was only a few years following her arrival in New York City that she and Berkman attempted to assassinate Henry Frick. However, in the years following the attempt on Frick's life, Goldman and her allies turned away from the use of violence and assassination for political purposes. In the wake of McKinley's assassination, Goldman published an article that withheld direct praise for Leon Czolgosz and instead offered sympathy for those driven \\"by great social stress\\" to commit atrocities. Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois, with a bas-relief by Jo Davidson. (The dates are incorrect.) Goldman's radicalism also influenced her personal views on sexuality. Coming from a traditional Russian Jewish family that stressed marriage and motherhood, Goldman rejected societal norms in favor of \\"free love.\\" As Goldman recalls in responding to critics of her open sexuality, \\"I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to become a nun‚Ä¶ If it meant that, I did not want it‚Ä¶ Even in spite of the condemnation of my own closest comrades I would live my beautiful idea.\\" References External links  Living My Life at RevoltLib Category:1931 non-fiction books Category:1934 non-fiction books Category:Anarchism in Russia Category:Biographies about anarchists Category:Books by Emma Goldman Category:Political autobiographies Category:Alfred A.

It was formed at a meeting in the Christchurch suburb of Papanui in June 1905 by two Liberal-aligned independents who sought a more \\"progressive\\" policy than that followed by the Liberal leader, Richard Seddon, and was similar to the Radical Party in 1896. Background The \\"Voucher incident\\" caused a split in New Liberal Party as moderates distanced themselves from Fisher The New Liberal Party was launched by Harry Bedford and Francis Fisher, but attracted a number of other MPs as well. George Laurenson, Frederick Baume, Alexander Hogg, William Tanner, and William Barber, all dissident Liberal MPs, associated themselves with the party, and two independents who had formerly been aligned with the loose opposition block, Ewen Alison and Alfred Harding, also joined. Tommy Taylor, a radical independent with a reputation as a firebrand, became the New Liberal Party's leader. Some Liberal dissidents, however, refused to be involved in the new party - the most notable being John Millar, George Fowlds, and Robert McNab. Many critics of Seddon believed that the New Liberals risked splitting the liberal vote and allowing a conservative government. The New Liberal Party announced an intention to contest the 1905 elections, but there was debate as to the exact nature of the party. Some saw the New Liberals as being complementary to (and possibly even a part of) the Liberal Party, spurring it forward but not directly challenging it. Others saw the New Liberals as a completely independent group that would stand against and eventually supplant the original Liberals. As a result of this disagreement, the New Liberals never developed a party organisation outside Parliament, and did not institute block voting - the party consisted of little more than regular caucus meetings. The New Liberals suffered considerable damage from the so-called \\"voucher incident\\", in which Francis Fisher alleged that Richard Seddon's son had been received payment from a government department for work he had not done. The allegations were disproven, and the New Liberals suffered a considerable public backlash. As Fisher had not consulted his colleagues before making the accusation, it also strained relations between party members. William Barber and Alexander Hogg sought rapproachment with Seddon, and others also appeared to distance themselves. As the election approached, the New Liberal Party comprised only Bedford, Fisher, and Taylor. The party, which now considered itself fully separate from the Liberals, contested a number of seats, including those held by Liberal MPs. Of the party's three MPs, two were defeated  Fisher was the only one to remain in Parliament. By the 1908 elections, the New Liberal Party was defunct, and Fisher was re- elected as an independent. He later joined the Reform Party, established in opposition to the Liberals.

Dying from an attack, Yron realizes that Stel was the better Lantern, acknowledging that Stel's lack of offensive action against the Krydos was because he recognized when not to take action rather than just because he was afraid, and with one last push of willpower, Yron brings Stel back to life. Stel routs the Krydos threat and is hailed as a hero while the dead Yron is vilified. The resurrected Stel, however, pronounces Yron a hero and wants to hear of his action while others fled and cowered, rather than of his failure.Green Lantern vol. 2 #182-183 (November‚ÄìDecember 1984). Green Man, from Green Lantern Corps: Recharge # 4 (February 2006). Art by Patrick Gleason and Prentis Rollins. Stel served with the Corps during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, through Hal Jordan's descent into madness and the loss of the power rings. With the Green Lantern Corps reinstated after the surviving Green Lanterns defeat Parallax on Earth, Stel joins again and is partnered with the Green Man. Stel helps a group of overwhelmed Lanterns, which include Soranik Natu, Kyle Rayner, Kilowog, Guy Gardner and two other Lantern rookies, Isamot Kol and Vath Sarn. The entire group, many with low power levels, then face Spider Guild forces. Stel was thought annihilated by an anti-matter explosion caused by a mind- controlled Green Man. Against all odds, he manages to survive the blast. A repentant Green Man finds Stel, and the two head to Mogo to repair themselves. Stel uses his ring's energy to compensate for his missing parts. On arriving the two find themselves, and Mogo, under attack by the Sinestro Corps. Despite having no realistic chance of surviving, even with the addition of a fourth Lantern, all involved are determined to stay. Reinforcements arrive just in time, though in the ensuing battles many Lanterns are slain. Stel is later seen trying to divert space debris to continue rebuilding himself. An unavoidable recall to Oa stops this. Stel and other Lanterns are then sent deep into the forbidden Okarran system in order to root out Sinestro Corps members. Stel is seen pursuing a Sinestro Corps member into the Vega system, where both are attacked by an Orange Lantern. Stel is badly wounded and sent back to Oa with the Orange Lantern's symbol burned onto his chest as a message to the Guardians from Larfleeze.Johns, Geoff. Green Lantern vol. 4 #39 (April 2009). Stel is on Oa during \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, when deceased Green Lanterns return in an attempt to harvest hearts. Following these events, Kilowog chose Stel as his replacement as the drill instructor for all Green Lantern recruits. Hal Jordan defies the Guardians by working with their enemies to corral powerful entities. Stel is part of a Green Lantern force sent to arrest Hal. He works with Salakk, B'dg (Sector 1014), Turytt (Sector 786), Norchavius (Sector 26), Meadlux (Sector 1776) and Bareer's sector partner Lok Neboora. Hal attempts to recruit them to aid in his quest and Stel argues for the group to listen. At that moment, malicious intervention with the Green Lantern power battery causes the group to go mad and attempt to kill Hal.\\"Green Lantern\\" #64 (May 2011) This situation erupts into the War of the Green Lanterns.

Medical reports can be voice files, notes taken during a lecture, or other spoken material. These are dictated over the phone or uploaded digitally via the Internet or through smart phone apps.  History  Medical records have been kept since humans began writing, as attested by ancient cave writings. Medical transcription as it is currently known has existed since the beginning of the 20th century, when standardization of medical data became critical to research.\\"From papyrus to the electronic tablet: a brief history of the clinical medical record with lessons for the digital age\\" Am J Med. 2013 Oct;126(10):853-7. do: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2013.03.024 At that time, medical stenographers replaced physicians as the recorders of medical information, taking doctors' dictation in shorthand. With the creation of audio recording devices, it became possible for physicians and their transcriptions to work asynchronously, thus beginning the profession of healthcare documentation as we currently know it. Over the years, transcription equipment has changed from manual typewriters to electric typewriters to word processors to computers and from plastic disks and magnetic belts to cassettes and endless loops and digital recordings. Today, speech recognition (SR), also known as continuous speech recognition (CSR), is increasingly being used, with medical transcriptions and or \\"editors\\" providing supplemental editorial services, although there are occasional instances where SR fully replaces the MT. Natural-language processing takes \\"automatic\\" transcription a step further, providing an interpretive function that speech recognition alone does not provide (although Ms do). In the past, these medical reports consisted of very abbreviated handwritten notes that were added in the patient's file for interpretation by the primary physician responsible for the treatment. Ultimately, this mess of handwritten notes and typed reports were consolidated into a single patient file and physically stored along with thousands of other patient records in a wall of filing cabinets in the medical records department. Whenever the need arose to review the records of a specific patient, the patient's file would be retrieved from the filing cabinet and delivered to the requesting physician. To enhance this manual process, many medical record documents were produced in duplicate or triplicate by means of carbon copy. In recent years, medical records have changed considerably. Although many physicians and hospitals still maintain paper records, there is a drive for electronic records.Feste, L., \\"Electronic Signature ‚Äì As it is Today\\", Journal of AHIMA (Chicago: AHIMA 1993), Vol. 64, No. 4, pp. 18-19. Filing cabinets are giving way to desktop computers connected to powerful servers, where patient records are processed and archived digitally. This digital format allows for immediate remote access by any physician who is authorized to review the patient information. Reports are stored electronically and printed selectively as the need arises. Many MTs now utilize personal computers with electronic references and use the Internet not only for web resources but also as a working platform. Technology has gotten so sophisticated that MT services and MT departments work closely with programmers and information systems (IS) staff to stream in voice and accomplish seamless data transfers through network interfaces. In fact, many healthcare providers today are enjoying the benefits of handheld PCs or personal data assistants (PDAs) and are now utilizing software on them.  Overview  Medical transcription is part of the healthcare industry that renders and edits doctor dictated reports, procedures, and notes in an electronic format in order to create files representing the treatment history of patients. Health practitioners dictate what they have done after performing procedures on patients and MT‚Äôs transcribe the oral dictation and/or edit reports that have gone through speech recognition software. Pertinent up-to- date, confidential patient information is converted to a written text document by a medical transcriptionist (MT). This text may be printed and placed in the patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in a hospital or who work at home as telecommuting employees for the hospital; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a hospital, clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their database gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of allergies, and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate healthcare delivery regardless of geographical distance or location. The term transcript or \\"report\\" as it is more commonly called, is used as the name of the document (electronic or physical hard copy) which results from the medical transcription process, normally in reference to the healthcare professional's specific encounter with a patient on a specific date of service. This report is referred to by many as a \\"medical record\\". Each specific transcribed record or report, with its own specific date of service, is then merged and becomes part of the larger patient record commonly known as the patient's medical history. This record is often called the patient's chart in a hospital setting. Medical transcription encompasses the MT, performing document typing and formatting functions according to an established criterion or format, transcribing the spoken word of the patient's care information into a written, easily readable form. MT requires correct spelling of all terms and words, (occasionally) correcting medical terminology or dictation errors. MTs also edit the transcribed documents, print or return the completed documents in a timely fashion. All transcription reports must comply with medico-legal concerns, policies and procedures, and laws under patient confidentiality. In transcribing directly for a doctor or a group of physicians, there are specific formats and report types used, dependent on that doctor's speciality of practice, although history and physical exams or consults are mainly utilized. In most of the off-hospital sites, independent medical practices perform consultations as a second opinion, pre-surgical exams, and as IMEs (Independent Medical Examinations) for liability insurance or disability claims. Some private practice family doctors choose not to utilize a medical transcriptionist, preferring to keep their patient's records in a handwritten format, although this is not true of all family practitioners. Currently, a growing number of medical providers send their dictation by digital voice files, utilizing a method of transcription called speech or voice recognition. Speech recognition is still a nascent technology that loses much in translation. For dictators to utilize the software, they must first train the program to recognize their spoken words. Dictation is read into the database and the program continuously \\"learns\\" the spoken words and phrases. Poor speech habits and other problems such as heavy foreign accents and mumbling complicate the process for both the MT and the recognition software. An MT can \\"flag\\" such a report as unintelligible, but the recognition software will transcribe the unintelligible word(s) from the existing database of \\"learned\\" language. The result is often a \\"word salad\\" or missing text. Thresholds can be set to reject a bad report and return it for standard dictation, but these settings are arbitrary. Below a set percentage rate, the word salad passes for actual dictation. The MT simultaneously listens, reads and \\"edits\\" the correct version. Every word must be confirmed in this process. The downside of the technology is when the time spent in this process cancels out the benefits. The quality of recognition can range from excellent to poor, with whole words and sentences missing from the report. Not infrequently, negative contractions and the word \\"not\\" is dropped altogether. These flaws trigger concerns that the present technology could have adverse effects on patient care. Control over quality can also be reduced when providers choose a server-based program from a vendor Application Service Provider (ASP). Downward adjustments in MT pay rates for voice recognition are controversial. Understandably, a client will seek optimum savings to offset any net costs. Yet vendors that overstate the gains in productivity do harm to MTs paid by the line. Despite the new editing skills required of MTs, significant reductions in compensation for voice recognition have been reported. Reputable industry sources put the field average for increased productivity in the range of 30‚Äì50%; yet this is still dependent on several other factors involved in the methodology. Metrics supplied by vendors that can be \\"used\\" in compensation decisions should be scientifically supported. Operationally, speech recognition technology (SRT) is an interdependent, collaborative effort. It is a mistake to treat it as compatible with the same organizational paradigm as standard dictation, a largely \\"stand-alone\\" system. The new software supplants an MT's former ability to realize immediate time-savings from programming tools such as macros and other word/format expanders. Requests for client/vendor format corrections delay those savings. If remote MTs cancel each other out with disparate style choices, they and the recognition engine may be trapped in a seesaw battle over control. Voice recognition managers should take care to ensure that the impositions on MT autonomy are not so onerous as to outweigh its benefits. Medical transcription is still the primary mechanism for a physician to clearly communicate with other healthcare providers who access the patient record, to advise them on the state of the patient's health and past/current treatment, and to assure continuity of care. More recently, following Federal and State Disability Act changes, a written report (IME) became a requirement for documentation of a medical bill or an application for Workers' Compensation (or continuation thereof) insurance benefits based on requirements of Federal and State agencies.  As a profession  An individual who performs medical transcription is known as a medical transcriber (MT) or a Medical Language Specialist (MLS). The equipment used is called a medical transcriber, e.g., a cassette player with foot controls operated by the MT for report playback and transcription. Education and training can be obtained through certificate or diploma programs, distance learning, and/or on-the-job training offered in some hospitals, although there are countries currently employing transcriptionists that require 18 months to 2 years of specialized MT training. Working in medical transcription leads to a mastery in medical terminology and editing, ability to listen and type simultaneously, utilization of playback controls on the transcriber (machine), and use of foot pedal to play and adjust dictations ‚Äì all while maintaining a steady rhythm of execution. Medical transcription training normally includes coursework in medical terminology, anatomy, editing and proofreading, grammar and punctuation, typing, medical record types and formats, and healthcare documentation. While medical transcription does not mandate registration or certification, individual MTs may seek out registration/certification for personal or professional reasons. Obtaining a certificate from a medical transcription training program does not entitle an MT to use the title of Certified Medical Transcriptionist. A Certified Healthcare Documentation Specialist (CHDS) credential can be earned by passing a certification examination conducted solely by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI), formerly the American Association for Medical Transcription (AAMT), as the credentialing designation they created. AHDI also offers the credential of Registered Healthcare Documentation Specialist (RHDS). According to AHDI, RHDS is an entry-level credential while the CHDS is an advanced level. AHDI maintains a list of approved medical transcription schools. Generally, certified medical transcriptionists earn more than their non- certified counterparts. It is also notable that training through an educational program that is approved by AHDI will increase the chances of an MT getting certified and getting hired. There is a great degree of internal debate about which training program best prepares an MT for industry work. Yet, whether one has learned medical transcription from an online course, community college, high school night course, or on-the-job training in a doctor's office or hospital, a knowledgeable MT is highly valued. In lieu of these AHDI certification credentials, MTs who can consistently and accurately transcribe multiple document work-types and return reports within a reasonable turnaround-time (TAT) are sought after. TATs set by the service provider or agreed to by the transcriptionist should be reasonable but consistent with the need to return the document to the patient's record in a timely manner. While most medical transcription agencies prefer candidates with a minimum of one year experience, formal instruction is not a requirement, and there is no mandatory test. Some hospitals require nothing more than a diploma for employment as a medical transcriptionist. The average pay range for an in- house MT in a hospital setting is $8/hr. However, MT/HDS can expect to receive anywhere from $12-$25 an hour, depending if they are working in a union or non-union environment. This large gap is because the job is based on production, so the more an MT can produce, the more they can make. On March 7, 2006, the MT occupation became an eligible U.S. Department of Labor Apprenticeship, a 2-year program focusing on acute care facility (hospital) work. In May 2004, a pilot program for Vermont residents was initiated, with 737 applicants for only 20 classroom pilot-program openings. The objective was to train the applicants as MTs in a shorter time period.

The medical transcription process  When the patient visits a doctor, the latter spends time with the former discussing his medical problems, including history and/or problems. The doctor performs a physical examination and may request various laboratory or diagnostic studies; will make a diagnosis or differential diagnoses, then decides on a plan of treatment for the patient, which is discussed and explained to the patient, with instructions provided. After the patient leaves the office, the doctor uses a voice-recording device to record the information about the patient encounter. This information may be recorded into a hand-held cassette recorder or into a regular telephone, dialed into a central server located in the hospital or transcription service office, which will 'hold' the report for the transcriptionist. This report is then accessed by a medical transcriptionist, it is clearly received as a voice file or cassette recording, who then listens to the dictation and transcribes it into the required format for the medical record, and of which this medical record is considered a legal document. The next time the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will call for the medical record or the patient's entire chart, which will contain all reports from previous encounters. The doctor can on occasion refill the patient's medications after seeing only the medical record, although doctors prefer to not refill prescriptions without seeing the patient to establish if anything has changed. It is very important to have a properly formatted, edited, and reviewed medical transcription document. If a medical transcriptionist accidentally typed a wrong medication or the wrong diagnosis, the patient could be at risk if the doctor (or his designee) did not review the document for accuracy. Both the doctor and the medical transcriptionist play an important role to make sure the transcribed dictation is correct and accurate. The doctor should speak slowly and concisely, especially when dictating medications or details of diseases and conditions. The medical transcriptionist must possess hearing acuity, medical knowledge, and good reading comprehension in addition to checking references when in doubt. However, some doctors do not review their transcribed reports for accuracy, and the computer attaches an electronic signature with the disclaimer that a report is \\"dictated but not read\\". This electronic signature is readily acceptable in a legal sense.\\"Executive Message\\", JAAMT, Vol. 12, No. 6, November‚ÄìDecember 1993. pp. 4-5. Modesto, CA. The transcriptionist is bound to transcribe verbatim (exactly what is said) and make no changes, but has the option to flag any report inconsistencies. On some occasions, the doctors do not speak clearly, or voice files are garbled. Some doctors are, unfortunately, time-challenged and need to dictate their reports quickly (as in ER Reports). In addition, there are many regional or national accents and (mis)pronunciations of words the MT must contend with. It is imperative and a large part of the job of the Transcriptionist to look up the correct spelling of complex medical terms, medications, obvious dosage or dictation errors, and when in doubt should \\"flag\\" a report. A \\"flag\\" on a report requires the dictator (or his designee) to fill in a blank on a finished report, which has been returned to him, before it is considered complete. Transcriptionists are never, ever permitted to guess, or 'just put in anything' in a report transcription. Furthermore, medicine is constantly changing. New equipment, new medical devices, and new medications come on the market on a daily basis, and the Medical Transcriptionist needs to be creative and to tenaciously research (quickly) to find these new words. An MT needs to have access to, or keep on memory, an up-to-date library to quickly facilitate the insertion of a correctly spelled device. Medical transcription editing Medical transcription editing is the process of listening to a voice-recorded file and comparing that to the transcribed report of that audio file, correcting errors as needed. Although speech recognition technology has become better at understanding human language, editing is still needed to ensure better accuracy. Medical transcription editing is also performed on medical reports transcribed by medical transcriptionists. =Medical transcription editors= Recent advances in speech recognition technology have shifted the job responsibilities of medical transcriptionists from not only transcribing but also editing. Editing has always been a part of the medical transcriptionist job, however now editing is a larger requirement as reports are more often being transcribed electronically. With different accents, articulations, and pronunciations, speech recognition technology can still have problems deciphering words. This is where the medical transcriptionist editor steps in. Medical transcription editors will compare and correct the transcribed file to the voice-recorded audio file. The job is similar to medical transcription as editing will use a foot pedal and the education and training requirements are mostly the same. =Training/Education= Education and training requirements for medical transcription editors is very similar to that of medical transcriptionists. Many medical transcription editors start out as medical transcriptionists and transition to editing. Several of the AHDI-approved medical transcription schools have seen the need for medical transcription editing training and have incorporated editing in their training programs. Quality training is key to success as a Medical Transcription / Healthcare Documentation Specialist. It is also very important to get work experience while training to ensure employers will be willing to hire freshly graduated students. Students who receive 'real world' training are much better suited for the medical transcription industry, than those who do not.  Outsourcing of medical transcription  Due to the increasing demand to document medical records, countries have started to outsource the services of medical transcription. The main reason for outsourcing is stated to be the cost advantage due to cheap labor in developing countries, and their currency rates as compared to the U.S. dollar. Drivers that Influence Outsourcing to Medical Transcription Partners. There is a volatile controversy on whether medical transcription work should be outsourced, mainly due to three reasons: # The greater majority of MTs presently work from home offices rather than in hospitals, working off-site for \\"national\\" transcription services. It is predominantly those nationals located in the United States who are striving to outsource work to other-than-US-based transcriptionists. In outsourcing work to sometimes lesser-qualified and lower-paid non-US MTs, the nationals unfortunately can force US transcriptionists to accept lower rates, at the risk of losing business altogether to the cheaper outsourcing providers. In addition to the low line rates forced on US transcriptionists, US MTs are often paid as ICs (independent contractors); thus, the nationals save on employee insurance and benefits offered, etc. Unfortunately, for the state of healthcare-related administrative costs in the United States, in outsourcing, the nationals still charge the hospitals the same rate as they did in the past for highly qualified US transcriptionists but subcontract the work to non-US MTs, keeping the difference as profit. # There are concerns about patient privacy, with confidential reports going from the country where the patient is located (i.e. the US) to a country where the laws about privacy and patient confidentiality may not even exist. The offshore provider has a clear business interest in preventing a data breach and could be prosecuted under HIPAA or other privacy laws, yet the counter argument is made that such a prosecution might never happen or if tried wouldn't get anywhere. Some of the countries that now outsource transcription work are the United States and Britain, with work outsourced to Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Australia, Pakistan and Barbados. # The quality of the finished transcriptions is a concern. Many outsourced transcriptionists simply do not have the requisite basic education to do the job with reasonable accuracy, as well as additional, occupation- specific training in medical transcription. Many foreign MTs who can speak English are not familiar with American expressions and/or the slang doctors often use, and can be unfamiliar with American names and places. An MT editor, certainly, is then responsible for all work transcribed from these countries and under these conditions. These outsourced transcriptionists often work for a fraction of what transcriptionists are paid in the United States, even with the US MTs daily accepting lower and lower rates. However, some firms choose to employ American transcriptionists as they believe the quality of work is better.

Some common uses of these systems can be found on E-commerce websites such as eBay, Amazon.com, and Etsy as well as online advice communities such as Stack Exchange. These reputation systems represent a significant trend in \\"decision support for Internet mediated service provisions\\". With the popularity of online communities for shopping, advice, and exchange of other important information, reputation systems are becoming vitally important to the online experience. The idea of reputations systems is that even if the consumer can't physically try a product or service, or see the person providing information, that they can be confident in the outcome of the exchange through trust built by recommender systems. Collaborative filtering, used most commonly in recommender systems, are related to reputation systems in that they both collect ratings from members of a community. The core difference between reputation systems and collaborative filtering is the ways in which they use user feedback. In collaborative filtering, the goal is to find similarities between users in order to recommend products to customers. The role of reputation systems, in contrast, is to gather a collective opinion in order to build trust between users of an online community. Types= Online = Howard Rheingold states that online reputation systems are \\"computer-based technologies that make it possible to manipulate in new and powerful ways an old and essential human trait\\". Rheingold says that these systems arose as a result of the need for Internet users to gain trust in the individuals they transact with online. The trait he notes in human groups is that social functions such as gossip \\"keeps us up to date on who to trust, who other people trust, who is important, and who decides who is important\\". Internet sites such as eBay and Amazon, he argues, seek to make use of this social trait and are \\"built around the contributions of millions of customers, enhanced by reputation systems that police the quality of the content and transactions exchanged through the site\\". = Reputation banks = The emerging sharing economy increases the importance of trust in peer-to-peer marketplaces and services. Users can build up reputation and trust in individual systems but usually don't have the ability to carry those reputations to other systems. Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers argue in their book What's Mine is Yours (2010), that \\"it is only a matter of time before there is some form of network that aggregates reputation capital across multiple forms of Collaborative Consumption\\". These systems, often referred to as reputation banks, try to give users a platform to manage their reputation capital across multiple systems. Maintaining effective reputation systems The main function of reputation systems is to build a sense of trust among users of online communities. As with brick and mortar stores, trust and reputation can be built through customer feedback. Paul Resnick from the Association of Computing Machinery describes three properties that are necessary for reputation systems to operate effectively. # Entities must have a long lifetime and create accurate expectations of future interactions. # They must capture and distribute feedback about prior interactions. # They must use feedback to guide trust. These three properties are critically important in building reliable reputations, and all revolve around one important element: user feedback. User feedback in reputation systems, whether it be in the form of comments, ratings, or recommendations, is a valuable piece of information. Without user feedback, reputation systems cannot sustain an environment of trust. Eliciting user feedback can have three related problems. # The first of these problems is the willingness of users to provide feedback when the option to do so is not required. If an online community has a large stream of interactions happening, but no feedback is gathered, the environment of trust and reputation cannot be formed. # The second of these problems is gaining negative feedback from users. Many factors contribute to users not wanting to give negative feedback, the most prominent being a fear of retaliation. When feedback is not anonymous, many users fear retaliation if negative feedback is given. # The final problem related to user feedback is eliciting honest feedback from users. Although there is no concrete method for ensuring the truthfulness of feedback, if a community of honest feedback is established, new users will be more likely to give honest feedback as well. Other pitfalls to effective reputation systems described by A. Josang et al. include change of identities and discrimination. Again these ideas tie back to the idea of regulating user actions in order to gain accurate and consistent user feedback. When analyzing different types of reputation systems it is important to look at these specific features in order to determine the effectiveness of each system. =Standardization attempt= The IETF proposed a protocol to exchange reputation data. It was originally aimed at email applications, but it was subsequently developed as a general architecture for a reputation-based service, followed by an email-specific part. However, the workhorse of email reputation remains with DNSxL's, which do not follow that protocol. Those specification don't say how to collect feedback ‚Äîin fact, the granularity of email sending entities makes it impractical to collect feedback directly from recipients‚Äî but are only concerned with reputation query/response methods.  Notable examples of practical applications  * Search: web (see PageRank) * eCommerce: eBay, Epinions, Bizrate, Trustpilot * Social news: Reddit, Digg, Imgur * Programming communities: Advogato, freelance marketplaces, Stack Overflow * Wikis: Increase contribution quantity and quality * Internet Security: TrustedSource * Question-and-Answer sites: Quora, Yahoo! Answers, Gutefrage.net, Stack Exchange * Email: DNSBL and DNSWL provide global reputation about email senders * Personal Reputation: CouchSurfing (for travelers), * Non Governmental organizations (NGOs): GreatNonProfits.org, GlobalGiving * Professional reputation of translators and translation outsourcers: BlueBoard at ProZ.com * All purpose reputation system: Yelp, Inc. * Academia: general bibliometric measures, e.g. the h-index of a researcher. Reputation as a resource High reputation capital often confers benefits upon the holder. For example, a wide range of studies have found a positive correlation between seller rating and asking price on eBay, indicating that high reputation can help users obtain more money for their items. High product reviews on online marketplaces can also help drive higher sales volumes. Abstract reputation can be used as a kind of resource, to be traded away for short-term gains or built up by investing effort. For example, a company with a good reputation may sell lower-quality products for higher profit until their reputation falls, or they may sell higher-quality products to increase their reputation. Some reputation systems go further, making it explicitly possible to spend reputation within the system to derive a benefit. For example, on the Stack Overflow community, reputation points can be spent on question \\"bounties\\" to incentivize other users to answer the question. Even without an explicit spending mechanism in place, reputation systems often make it easier for users to spend their reputation without harming it excessively. For example, a ridesharing company driver with a high ride acceptance score (a metric often used for driver reputation) may opt to be more selective about his or her clientele, decreasing the driver's acceptance score but improving his or her driving experience. With the explicit feedback provided by the service, drivers can carefully manage their selectivity to avoid being penalized too heavily.  Attacks and defense  Reputation systems are in general vulnerable to attacks, and many types of attacks are possible. As the reputation system tries to generate an accurate assessment based on various factors including but not limited to unpredictable user size and potential adversarial environments, the attacks and defense mechanisms play an important role in the reputation systems. Attack classification of reputation system is based on identifying which system components and design choices are the targets of attacks. While the defense mechanisms are concluded based on existing reputation systems. = Attacker model = The capability of the attacker is determined by several characteristics, e.g., the location of the attacker related to the system (insider attacker vs. outsider attacker). An insider is an entity who has legitimate access to the system and can participate according to the system specifications, while an outsider is any unauthorized entity in the system who may or may not be identifiable. As the outsider attack is much more similar to other attacks in a computer system environment, the insider attack gets more focus in the reputation system. Usually, there are some common assumptions: the attackers are motivated either by selfish or malicious intent and the attackers can either work alone or in coalitions. = Attack classification = Attacks against reputation systems are classified based on the goals and methods of the attacker. * Self- promoting Attack. The attacker falsely increases their own reputation. A typical example is the so-called Sybil attack where an attacker subverts the reputation system by creating a large number of pseudonymous entities, and using them to gain a disproportionately large influence. A reputation system's vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how cheaply Sybils can be generated, the degree to which the reputation system accepts input from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity, and whether the reputation system treats all entities identically. * Whitewashing Attack. The attacker uses some system vulnerability to update their reputation. This attack usually targets the reputation system‚Äôs formulation that is used to calculate the reputation result. The whitewashing attack can be combined with other types of attacks to make each one more effective. * Slandering Attack. The attacker reports false data to lower the reputation of the victim nodes. It can be achieved by a single attacker or a coalition of attackers. * Orchestrated Attack. The attacker orchestrates their efforts and employs several of the above strategies. One famous example of an orchestrated attack is known as an oscillation attack. * Denial of Service Attack. The attacker prevents the calculation and dissemination of reputation values in reputation systems by using Denial of Service method. =Defense strategies = Here are some strategies to prevent the above attacks. * Preventing Multiple Identities * Mitigating Generation of False Rumors * Mitigating Spreading of False Rumors * Preventing Short-Term Abuse of the System * Mitigating Denial of Service Attacks See also * Collaborative filtering * Commons-based peer production * Government by algorithm * Honor system * Karma * Online participation * Reputation capital * Reputation management * Sesame Credit * Social Credit System * Sharing economy * Social reputation in fiction * Social translucence * Subjective logic * Trust metric * Web of trust * Whuffie References  * D.

The film participated in the Toronto International Film Festival (2005), the Berlin International Film Festival (2006), and the Hawaii International Film Festival.  Plot summary  Ottar Thor is the star player of the Icelandic football team KR (Reykjav√≠k FC). He is a well liked player who causes a stir when he admits being gay to his teammates and then goes on a journey to discover himself (with the help of the local press). He soon finds himself on the bench for most of his team's matches and decides to call it quits with KR. He joins a small amateur team mainly made up of men like himself - gay guys trying to play soccer in a straight world. The director of KR, who happens to be Ottar Thor's father, tries everything in his power to persuade Ottar to come back and play for his team, but the catch is that he needs to get himself back into the closet before playing pro football again. A struggle between father and son starts. Ottar Thor also has a son, a teenager that is not coping too well with all the attention his father is getting, for all the wrong reasons. Ottar Thor finally gives into his father and returns to KR on the condition that KR plays one match against the gay team. His father accepts this condition, not realising that the match will take place on Gay Pride Day.

Green Man first appeared in DC Comics' Green Lantern (vol. 2) # 164 (May 1983), and was created by writer Todd Klein and artist Dave Gibbons.Todd Klein's Blog Fictional character biography \\"Green Man\\" is the adopted name of the Green Lantern from the Space Sector designated 2828 by the Green Lantern Corps. Uxorians frown upon individuality, and in Green Man‚Äôs own words, \\"On Uxor, all are one\\". Green Man was a misfit who rebelled against his society‚Äôs anti- individualism, and longed for a personal identity. When the Guardians of the Universe offered him a position as a member of their Green Lantern Corps, Green Man jumped at the chance. One of the complications of this choice was that Green Man could never again legally enter his home star system, because of the pact the Guardians made with the Psions of Vega, which prohibits the Corps presence in that sector. Green Man's enlistment of the aid of the Omega Men in attacking the nestworld of a group of humanoid arachnids called the Spider Guild a few light years outside the Vega system resulted in a reprimand by the Guardians, which ultimately led to the Green Man quitting the Green Lantern Corps and joining the Omega Men. As a member of the Omega Men, Green Man encountered many other beings in his adventures, such as the goddess X'Hal, who lived inside the star Vega; the whale-like Viathans; the Psions, who performed experiments on Green Man when he was brought to their research center, Wombworld; the Tamarans, and others. The Green Man was killed by Durlans in the Invasion! mini-series when the Omega Men were attacked by a coalition of aliens who were eliminating any opposition, including members of the then-disbanded Green Lantern Corps. In the non-canonical Green Lantern Versus Aliens Green Man assists in placing the titular aliens on the planet Mogo. Green Lantern Versus Aliens #1-4 (September - December 2000) =Second Green Man= Green Man (right), with his partner Stel, from Green Lantern Corps: Recharge #4 (February 2006). Art by Patrick Gleason and Prentis Rollins. A second Uxorian also known as Green Man is partnered with the robot Stel, the Green Lantern of the planet Grenda, in Sector 3009, as seen in the miniseries Green Lantern Corps: Recharge. Green Man is one of the Lanterns who participated in the defense of Oa against the onslaught of Superboy-Prime, as depicted in Infinite Crisis #7. Showing remorse over the apparent death of his partner, Green Man searched for Stel, and found him badly damaged, but functioning. The two then retreated to Mogo to ready themselves physically and mentally for the attacking Sinestro Corps. Following the Sinestro Corps War, the Guardians of the Universe established a new unit within the ranks of the Green Lantern Corps to uphold the Ten New Laws of the Book of Oa. This unit became known as the Alpha Lantern Corps. Green Man has been confirmed as a member of the Alpha Lanterns. He is later shown in Final Crisis #1. He appears again in issue #5, during Hal Jordan's trial and the subsequent events that clarify fellow Alpha Lantern Kraken is possessed by Granny Goodness. =Death= As part of DC's \\"Brightest Day\\" storyline, Cyborg Superman hijacked the Alpha Lantern Corps. After he was defeated and the Alphas freed from his control, Ganthet managed to restore their emotions, including Green Man's. During the War of the Green Lanterns storyline, Alpha Lantern Varix felt that all the Alphas had become dangerously mentally unstable. He caused a reaction which killed all the Alpha Lanterns.\\"Green Lantern Corps\\" (vol. 3) #12 (August 2012) Powers and abilities The Green Man, after being stripped of his ring and lantern by the Guardians, demonstrated an ability to produce a portal which he could hear and see though and use to transport himself. He was also able to pick up on the brainwaves of others in a form of telepathy. After becoming a cyborg, Green Man has no more need for sleeping, resting or eating. Fully powered by his internal power battery, Green Man is mainlined to the Central Battery and the Book of Oa. Uxorians possess a deadly nerve toxin in their blood stream, which acts as a defense mechanism against predators. Uxorians are also amphibious. Upon his induction in the Alpha Lanterns Corps he is turned into a cyborg, fully covered with metallic plates. He carries a power battery embedded into his chest, no longer needing to recharge his ring from an external source, and a secondary face under his faceplate able to drain power rings, like the Manhunters have. In other media Green Man is one of the Green Lanterns who appear in the animated film Green Lantern: First Flight fighting Sinestro. Green Man appears in a cameo in the Green Lantern live-action film. His appearance in the film differs to some extent from the comics, as he is shown as less humanoid, although his design retains his more prominent features from the comics, such as his spotted green skin, the mask and robust frame. He is also part of the film toyline. Green Man appears in Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. He is among the Green Lantern Corps members who are on Oa when Darkseid attacks and is killed by him.

He fought in several battles with his brother, Flying Hawk and first cousin, Crazy Horse during the War for the Black Hills, including Battle of the Greasy Grass. Kicking Bear was one of the five warrior cousins who sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1877. The ceremony was held to honor Crazy Horse one year after the victory at the Battle of the Little Bighorn (known as the Battle of the Greasy Grass to the Sioux), and to offer prayers for him in the trying times ahead. Crazy Horse attended the Sun Dance as the honored guest but did not take part in the dancing.Edward Kadlecek and Mabell Kadlecek, To Kill An Eagle: Indian Views on the Last Days of Crazy Horse, 1981, p.40. The five warrior cousins were brothers Kicking Bear, Flying Hawk and Black Fox II, all sons of Chief Black Fox, also known as Great Kicking Bear, and two other cousins, Eagle Thunder and Walking Eagle.\\"Young Black Fox was the half brother of Kicking Bear and Flying Hawk. On September 4, 1877, Young Black Fox commanded Crazy Horse's warriors in his absence. The courage displayed on that occasion earned him the respect of both Indians and whites alike. In the same year Young Black Fox sought sanctuary in Canada, but he was killed on his return to the United States in 1881 by Indians of an enemy tribe.\\" See McCreight, Firewater and Forked Tongues: A Sioux Chief Interprets U.S. History, (1947), p.4. The five warrior cousins were braves considered vigorous battle men of distinction.Kadlecek,p.143. Also, see Kingsley M. Bray, Crazy Horse: A Lakota Life, 2006, P.314. Kicking Bear was also a holy man active in the Ghost Dance religious movement of 1890, and had traveled with fellow Lakota Short Bull to visit the movement's leader, Wovoka (a Paiute holy man living in Nevada). The three Lakota men were instrumental in bringing the movement to their people who were living on reservations in South Dakota. Following the murder of Sitting Bull, Kicking Bear and Short Bull were imprisoned at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. Upon their release in 1891, both men joined Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show, and toured with the show in Europe. That experience was humiliating to him . After a year-long tour, Kicking Bear returned to the Pine Ridge Reservation to care for his family. In March 1896, Kicking Bear traveled to Washington, D.C. as one of three Sioux delegates taking grievances to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He made his feelings known about the drunken behavior of traders on the reservation, and asked that Native Americans have more ability to make their own decisions. While in Washington, Kicking Bear agreed to have a life mask made of himself. The mask was to be used as the face of a Sioux warrior to be displayed in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. A gifted artist, he painted his account of the Battle of Greasy Grass at the request of artist Frederic Remington in 1898, more than twenty years after the battle. Kicking Bear was buried with the arrowhead as a symbol of the ways he so dearly desired to resurrect when he died on May 28, 1904. His remains are buried somewhere in the vicinity of Manderson-White Horse Creek. Sculpture from life mask of Kicking Bear by Alexander Phimister Proctor, on Q Street Bridge, Washington, D.C.

The toxin is produced by the bacterium Rathayibacter toxicus (formerly Clavibacter toxicus), which is carried into the ryegrass by the nematode Anguina funesta. History ARGT was first recorded in vicinity of Black Springs, South Australia, in the 1950s and then near Gnowangerup, Western Australia, in the 1960s. The disease has spread rapidly and approximately 40,000 to 60,000 square kilometres of farmland in Western Australia, and similar areas in South Australia are now infested by the ARGT-causing organisms. Most ARGT-related livestock losses occur during October to January, but losses have been recorded as late as April. Symptoms ARGT is a neurological condition and affects the brain. Sheep may at first appear perfectly normal, but if driven for a hundred metres or so, the slight stress will cause mildly affected animals to lag behind the rest of the flock and exhibit a high-stepping gait. More seriously affected animals may lose co-ordination and stumble, but will usually recover and join the rest of the flock if left quietly alone. The most-severely affected sheep will fall repeatedly and may be unable to get up. These sheep are likely to die, with death sometimes occurring within a few hours of the first symptoms appearing. Prevention Herbicide applications aimed to reduce ryegrass population have been successful in reducing the risk of ARGT but have undesirable effects such as rapid reduction in pasture productivity and increase in ryegrass herbicide resistance. A recently released biological control agent, the twist fungus, has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the risk ARGT without the need of controlling ryegrass. The first use of the twist fungus inoculum was in 1997.

Filmed in Romani and Serbo-Croatian, Time of the Gypsies tells the story of a young Romani man with magical powers who is tricked into engaging in petty crime. It is widely considered to be one of Kusturica's best films. The film was recorded in Sarajevo, Skopje and Milan, by the Forum Sarajevo. The film was selected as the Yugoslav entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The film revolves around Perhan, a Romani teenager with telekinetic powers and his passage from childhood to adulthood which starts in a little village in Yugoslavia and ends in the criminal underworld of Milan. The film deals with magic realism. The film's soundtrack was composed by Goran Bregoviƒá. Plot Perhan lives with his devoted grandmother Khatidza, his lame sister Danira and his dissolute uncle Merdzan. Khatidza possesses a level of supernatural powers (mainly healing) and Perhan himself inherited some minor telekinetic abilities. He wants to marry a girl named Azra, but her mother won't allow it, as Perhan is the illegitimate son of a Slovenian soldier who had an affair with Perhan's late mother. Ahmed, the \\"Gypsy sheik,\\" comes to the village with his brothers. Merdzan loses his clothes playing cards with Ahmed's brothers, and comes home desperate for money so that he can repay. It is raining and not finding any money, he accuses the grandmother of hiding the money from him and lifts the frame of the house up (using a rope and a truck), so that it is suspended in mid-air as the rain comes down on Perhan, his grandmother and Danira. Very soon after, Khatidza is summoned to use her powers to save Ahmed's sick son, Roberto, which Khatidza does. For repayment, she proposes a deal with Ahmed - to pay for Danira's leg to be healed at a hospital in Ljubljana. Perhan goes with Danira, promising his grandmother not to leave her, but Ahmed asks where will he stay and convinces him to go to Milan. At first Perhan wants to make money honestly, but after being dragged through the mud, Perhan begins stealing and squirreling money away in a shack. After being double-crossed by his brother Sadam, Ahmed appoints Perhan boss of the operation. Now relatively rich, Perhan goes home, where he is enraged to find Azra is pregnant. Perhan refuses to believe that the baby is his. They marry with the condition that she sell the baby. Perhan is also disappointed to find that the house Ahmed promised to build him is not being built at all, and that Danira was not operated on, but forced to be a beggar as part of Ahmed's money operation. On their wedding night, Azra tells him the child is theirs, and was conceived when they made love on the Feast of St George. Still wearing her wedding dress, Azra dies after giving birth to a boy while levitating mid-air (a sign that the boy, as he inherited the powers, is indeed Perhan's). Because Ahmed leaves with the baby, which we discover later is also named Perhan, he is raised by Ahmed's crew. After four years of searching, Perhan reunites with Danira in Rome, who leads him to Perhan Jr., whom Perhan now accepts as his child. Perhan drops the children off at the train station, promising to meet up with them after buying an accordion for his son and a present (sponges) for grandmother. The boy tells him he is mad at him because he will not return, and he will not get an accordion. Perhan assures him he will, \\"Cross my gypsy heart,\\" but immediately runs out of the station to settle the score with Ahmed, who is about to be married. Perhan arrives at the wedding and kills Ahmed with a fork, using his telekinetic powers. He also kills Ahmed's brothers, but he is in turn killed by Ahmed's new wife. At the funeral, the grandmother passes out drinks to everyone and Perhan Jr. goes outside the house, peers through the window at his dead father, breaks the glass and steals the golden coins put on his father's eyes. Merdzan notices, and follows him out in the rain, as the child runs away hidden under a cardboard box. Merdzan is about to catch him up and pick up the board, but seems to have second thoughts, stops, and starts running toward the nearby church.

He served as a soldier in the French and Indian War, and he was the founder of the town of Swansboro, North Carolina.  Early life  Theophilus Weeks was born 1708 in Falmouth, Massachusetts. His parents were Benjamin and Mary Chase Weeks. In 1730, Benjamin Weeks moved the family North Carolina, settling on Hadnots Creek.THEOPHILUS WEEKS - Founder of Swansboro At about the same time, another group from Falmouth, Jonathan Green, Sr., his brother Isaac Green, and their families, settled on the other side of the White Oak River, in what is now Onslow County (Onslow was formed from New Hanover and Carteret counties in 1734). The White Oak River forms the boundary between Onslow and Carteret counties. Jonathan Green, Sr., died about 1735, at the age of about 35 years. On 7 October 1735, Theophilus Weeks married his widow, Grace, and moved into the Green plantation. In time, he bought out Isaac Green‚Äôs half interest in the property and the latter returned to Massachusetts. The plantation was located on the Onslow (west) side of the mouth of the White Oak River, and was named ‚ÄúThe Wharf.‚Äù Theophilus and Grace had at least four children. It is likely that he must have had a daughter or two, although their names are not known. At a court held 5 April 1743, Theophilus proved rights for eight white persons belonging to his family. The religious affiliation of Theophilus Weeks is not known, however, he is descended from the Reverend John Robinson, pastor of the Pilgrims in Holland. Considering that many other members of the Weeks family in the Hadnots Creek area were deeply involved in the early Baptist movement, it is probable that Theophilus Weeks and his family were among them. In January 1741 (New Style), he recorded his livestock branding, which indicated agricultural interests. In 1747 he borrowed some ¬£200 from Colonel John Starkey, and used the land he had purchased from Isaac Green as security. Weeks repaid this loan repaid by the end of the next year. Weeks received two land grants in Onslow County on 6 April 1745, for each. On 10 April 1761, four additional grants totaling , and on 4 May 1769, an additional were received. In 1754 the Onslow Regiment of Militia was organized in response to the French and Indian Wars. The regiment was divided into four companies, and Theophilus Weeks became a sergeant in Captain Stephen Lee‚Äôs company of Colonel John Starkey‚Äôs Onslow Regiment of Militia. He is listed on a unit roster dated 12 March 1754. It was to meet at Jonathan Milton‚Äôs residence on New River for a general muster. In 1751 Weeks petitioned the Onslow Court for permission to operate an ordinary, and he did receive a license to ‚Äúkeep an ordinary at his now dwelling place.‚Äù\\"A restaurant, public house, or dining room serving all guests and customers the same standard meal or fare\\" (from Online Dictionary The White Oak River flows into Bogue Inlet, and this suggests that port activity was thriving at the mouth of the river, and that the Weeks‚Äô plantation was a favorite place for seafarers to visit. He was appointed inspector of exports for Bogue Inlet in 1757, and he held that position for the rest of his life.  Origins of Swansboro  Probably the greatest accomplishment of his life came with the founding of the town of Swansboro. His plantation, The Wharf, was an ideal location for trade and navigation, and as commerce increased, he saw the advantage it offered as a seaport. It is not known exactly when he decided to establish a town on his property. It is possible that he considered the idea for years. His plans were finalized early in 1771, or possibly the year before. The settlement was laid out with six streets, and contained forty-eight lots. The lots were arranged in three tiers, with sixteen lots each. Three of the streets ran basically north and south, and the other three east and west. They are known today as Front, Water, Elm, Moore, Main (originally Broad), and Church Streets. A county road extended northeastward from Broad Street to the Onslow Courthouse (which no longer exists, as the Onslow county seat is now at Jacksonville). All the streets were wide, except Front and Broad Streets, which were . All the original lots were 60 x , except on the north side of Front Street. These seven water lots (numbers 10-16) extended across it to the river. Sale of the lots went slowly, and only five of the forty-eight had been sold when Theophilus died. The Weeks home was on the west side of Broad Street (now Main), lot #7, somewhere between Front and Water Streets, just up from the wharf so he could see the ships as they came in. A dock was located nearby where ships tied up for him to inspect their cargo. Lot #6 was sold to Edward Starkey on 11 May 1771, and Lots #2 and #5 were sold to Ezekiel Hunter. Lot #11 was sold to Mrs. Mary Pitts, who received the deed for what was called \\"lot number 11 in the plan of a town laid out by Theophilus Weeks.\\" One of the town‚Äôs original houses, that of Jonathan Green, Jr.‚Äôs son, Samuel, is still standing. The town was known by several names during its early years. Some people referred to it as Weeks Point, Weeks Landing, Weeks Wharf, The Wharf, and others as New Town. In one petition, it is called \\"New Town upon Bogue.\\" It was generally called Bogue during the Revolutionary War era. The confusion was finally settled in 1783, when it was incorporated and an act of the General Assembly officially named it Swansborough, in honor of Samuel Swann, Speaker of the colonial assembly and official representative of Onslow in the Assembly. The name was later shortened to Swansboro.  Later life  The exact date and cause of Theophilus Weeks‚Äô death are unknown. It was probably in early January, 1772. He last appears in the public records on 1 January 1772, when he and his wife sold to Archibald Gillespie. When the Onslow Court met a few days later, Gillespie was appointed inspector for Bogue Inlet, ‚Äúin the room of Theophilus Weeks, deceased.‚Äù His wife, Grace, died in August 1792. Swansboro celebrated its bicentennial in 1983. About 150 people were on hand, of whom 85 were descendants of him or his brother, Jabez. As part of the Fourth of July celebration, a memorial marker was dedicated to Theophilus Weeks as founder of Swansboro. References External links  *Excerpts from Claiborne S.

Bad Lobenstein, Thuringia, Institut f√ºr Auslandsbeziehungen, 2007. http://kuenstlerdatenbank.ifa.de/datenblatt.php3?ID=556 18 September 1946) is a German architect and professor. He is a representative of Postmodern and New Classical Architecture, as well as a protagonist of New Urbanism. Early life Kollhoff spent the first six years of his life on the family farm in Thuringia at the southern tip of the newly established DDR. In 1953 the family escaped to West Germany and settled in Northern Baden. Career Main Plaza, Frankfurt am Main (completed in 2001) Kollhoff began his architecture studies at the University of Karlsruhe in 1968. As an undergraduate student Kollhoff was indirectly introduced to the teaching of Egon Eiermann through the courses that Eiermann had written, but no longer taught, and through his work in the Karlsruhe studio of architect Gerhard Assem who had been a collaborator of Eiermann. In 1974 Kollhoff studied at the Vienna University of Technology, and worked for one year at the studio of Hans Hollein. He returned to Karlsruhe to complete his diploma thesis in 1975. ETH Zurich. Then with a scholarship from the DAAD to attend Cornell University, Kollhoff studied, alongside Rem Koolhaas, amongst the stimulating atmosphere prompted by the academic rivalry between architectural historian Colin Rowe and architect and theorist Oswald Mathias Ungers. Kollhoff became an assistant to Ungers in 1977. Kollhoff opened his own studio in Berlin in 1978, and since 1984 has run the studio in partnership with Helga Timmermann. Until 1985, he was an assistant at the HdK (Berlin University of the Arts), and until 2012, Kollhoff was Professor of Architecture and Construction at the ETH Z√ºrich. He has held several guest-professorships both at home and abroad. His projects as an architect in Germany and Europe span all scales, from the civic to the residential. Hans Kollhoff's architecture is characterised by a classical building-style and the use of solid, traditional materials, such as stone and brick, worked according to traditional methods. During his career, Kollhoff has developed in the direction of a more and more traditional form, often using classical motifs. For this reason he is sometimes criticized for creating an outdated \\"retro-architecture\\", that loses itself in a nostalgic imitation of traditional formalism. However Kollhoff's work, with its attention to detail also within the interior space, may be read as a continuation of the work of early twentieth century architects, see Adolf Loos. In Berlin, he has designed in Potsdamer Platz a high-rise tower in an old-New York brick style, for DaimlerChrysler. He was also responsible for the master planning of high-rise buildings on the Alexanderplatz. Among his works are also the reconstruction of the former Reichsbank into the new Foreign Office, and the so-called Leibnizkolonnaden in the district of Charlottenburg- Wilmersdorf near the Kurf√ºrstendamm. In 2005 he constructed the inner rooms of the exclusive night club Goya on Nollendorfplatz, that opened on December 1 in the building where the Metropol had formerly been. In Frankfurt am Main he has erected the 88 meter tall residential building Main Plaza in the Deutschherrnviertel. Since 2004 Kollhoff leads the \\"Bauakademie\\" project, whose goal is to reconstruct the Karl Friedrich Schinkel building, Berlin 1836, which was demolished in 1962.

The Franco-Piedmontese forces were victorious. It was fought just south to Palestro, a town in what is now the province of Pavia in northern Italy. It was believed that the Battle of Palestro was the last European battle in which a European Monarch rode into battle, that being King Victor Emmanuel II, who directly entered the fray with the Austrians.The Battle of Palestro Background Bersaglieri troops of the 4th Piedmontese Division After the battle of Montebello of the 20 May 1859, the Franco-Piedmontese army moved towards Novara, aiming to reach Milan, the capital of Lombardy-Venetia, the Austrian province in northern Italy. Part of the Piedmontese forces advanced to Robbio to cover the right flank of the allied army. Battle On the 30 May the Piedmontese crossed the Sesia river and, after a hard fight, managed to take control of Palestro, Vinzaglio, and Confienza. The following day, in order to test the enemy's strength, Austrian field-marshal Friedrich Zobel ordered two of his infantry divisions to attack Palestro. The 4th Piedmontese Division under general Enrico Cialdini took position between Palestro and the road to Robbio, with the 10th Infantry Regiment on his left, the 9th Regiment defending Cascina San Pietro, and the 3rd Zouaves Regiment on his right flank, on an island in the river known as Sesietta. The King of Sardinia-Piedmont, Victor Emmanuel II, was in Palestro and followed the early course of the battle from the town's bell tower. The Austrians first attacked the Piedmontese line at Palestro, but were pushed back to Robbio. The Piedmontese at Cascina San Pietro were also under heavy attack from Austrian troops from Rosasco. The situation was solved by the rushed attack of the 3rd Zouaves Regiment under Colonel Chabron, who attacked the left flank of the Austrian contingents. The Zouaves were able to reach the enemy's artillery, defended by the 7th Tirolese Hunters Regiment. Then they launched a bayonet attack against the four infantry battalions of the 12th Regiment \\"Archduke William\\". The positions conquered by the French units were immediately reinforced by Italian troops, led personally by Victor Emmanuel, which arrived in time to repel an Austrian counterattack. French Zouaves de la Garde in Italy, 1859 After the Franco-Piedmontese troops had strengthened their bridgehead over the Sesia river, Zobel, despite his numerical superiority, retired towards Robbio.

In set-builder notation, }. The notation is analogous with that for an inverse function. Although many functions do not have an inverse, every relation does have a unique converse. The unary operation that maps a relation to the converse relation is an involution, so it induces the structure of a semigroup with involution on the binary relations on a set, or, more generally, induces a dagger category on the category of relations as detailed below. As a unary operation, taking the converse (sometimes called conversion or transposition) commutes with the order-related operations of the calculus of relations, that is it commutes with union, intersection, and complement. The converse relation is also called the or transpose relation the latter in view of its similarity with the transpose of a matrix. It has also been called the opposite or dual of the original relation, or the inverse of the original relation, or the reciprocal L¬∞ of the relation L.Peter J.

The converse of kinship relations are named: \\"A is a child of B\\" has converse \\"B is a parent of A\\". \\"A is a nephew or niece of B\\" has converse \\"B is an uncle or aunt of A\\". The relation \\"A is a sibling of B\\" is its own converse, since it is a symmetric relation.

The power set of all subsets of U is the domain of the converse { i} = {\\\\in^\\\\mathsf{T}}. Properties In the monoid of binary endorelations on a set (with the binary operation on relations being the composition of relations), the converse relation does not satisfy the definition of an inverse from group theory, i.e. if L is an arbitrary relation on X, then L \\\\circ L^\\\\mathsf{T} does not equal the identity relation on X in general. The converse relation does satisfy the (weaker) axioms of a semigroup with involution: \\\\left(L^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\right)^\\\\mathsf{T} = L and \\\\left(L \\\\circ R\\\\right)^\\\\mathsf{T} = R^\\\\mathsf{T} \\\\circ L^\\\\mathsf{T}. Since one may generally consider relations between different sets (which form a category rather than a monoid, namely the category of relations Rel), in this context the converse relation conforms to the axioms of a dagger category (aka category with involution). A relation equal to its converse is a symmetric relation; in the language of dagger categories, it is self-adjoint. Furthermore, the semigroup of endorelations on a set is also a partially ordered structure (with inclusion of relations as sets), and actually an involutive quantale. Similarly, the category of heterogeneous relations, Rel is also an ordered category. In the calculus of relations, conversion (the unary operation of taking the converse relation) commutes with other binary operations of union and intersection. Conversion also commutes with unary operation of complementation as well as with taking suprema and infima. Conversion is also compatible with the ordering of relations by inclusion. If a relation is reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, asymmetric, transitive, total, trichotomous, a partial order, total order, strict weak order, total preorder (weak order), or an equivalence relation, its converse is too. Inverses If I represents the identity relation, then a relation R may have an inverse as follows: :A relation R is called right-invertible if there exists a relation X with R \\\\circ X = I, and left-invertible if there exists a Y with Y \\\\circ R = I. Then X and Y are called the right and left inverse of R, respectively. Right- and left-invertible relations are called invertible. For invertible homogeneous relations all right and left inverses coincide; the notion inverse R‚Äì1 is used. Then R‚Äì1 = RT holds. =Converse relation of a function= A function is invertible if and only if its converse relation is a function, in which case the converse relation is the inverse function. The converse relation of a function f : X \\\\to Y is the relation f^{-1} : Y \\\\to X defined by \\\\operatorname{graph}\\\\, f^{-1} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{(y, x) \\\\mid y = f(x)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This is not necessarily a function: One necessary condition is that f be injective, since else f^{-1} is multi-valued. This condition is sufficient for f^{-1} being a partial function, and it is clear that f^{-1} then is a (total) function if and only if f is surjective. In that case, i.e. if f is bijective, f^{-1} may be called the inverse function of f. For example, the function f(x) = 2x + 2 has the inverse function f^{-1}(x) = \\\\frac{x}{2} - 1. However, the function g(x) = x^2 has the inverse relation g^{-1}(x) = \\\\pm x^\\\\frac{1}{2}, which is not a function, being multi-valued.

His most notable contribution was to establish the Hooghly Mohsin College and the Hooghly Imambara. He also played a significant role during the great famine of Bengal in 1776‚Äì1777 by helping thousands of the victims. Early life Mohsin was born to Haji Faizullah and Zainab Khanam in Hooghly (now in West Bengal, India) in 1732. He was home-schooled and gained knowledge in the study of the Quran, Hadith and the Fiqh. Later, he went on a voyage to other countries of Asia, including the regions in current-day Iran, Iraq, Turkey and the Arab peninsula. He also made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and visited Medina, Kufa, Karbala and other holy places. After performing the Hajj, he was given the title Haji.  Philanthropy  Hooghly Imambara founded by Haji Muhammad Mohsin at Hooghly Following his return, Mohsin took over the management of the estate of his half-sister, Munnujan. She was the widow of Mirza Salahuddin, the Naib-faujdar or deputy military governor of Hooghly working for the Nawab of Bengal. She inherited a fortune from her mother Zainab, whose first husband Aga Motahar had much land and properties in Hooghly, Jessore, Murshidabad and Nadia. After Munnujan's death in 1803, Mohsin inherited all of her fortune. He bequeathed this fortune for charity and created a Waqf or trust in 1806, with his entire wealth of 156,000 taka. One-third of his fortune was to be donated for education and religious programmes, four-ninths for pensions to the elderly and disabled, and the remaining two-ninths for the expenses of the two trustees.  Death and legacy  Mohsin died on 29 November 1812. Due to his contributions in the field of education, Mohsin is the namesake of many educational institutions in India and Bangladesh. The New Hooghly College in Chinsurah, West Bengal, which now bears his name as the Hooghly Mohsin College was established by him.See Dey (1893: 96/192) pp.286-287, and (1893: 97/194), pp.354-366. He is the namesake of Government Hazi Mohammad Mohshin College, Chittagong, Bangladesh. and the Haji Muhammad Mohsin Hall, University of Dhaka. Mohsin is also the namesake of a Bangladesh Navy base located in Dhaka.

Lakah was born in Egypt to a Coptic Christian Egyptian family, and first came to prominence with his brother Michel Lakah in the mid-1990s. They had holdings in construction, healthcare management and aviation. In November 1998, their holdings were floated on the Cairo Stock Exchange with Rami owning 38% and Michel 31%. He is an Egyptian nationalist who showed interest in Egypt's political life. Egyptian Parliament In November 2000 Lakah was elected to the Egyptian Parliament at the relatively young age of 40. His election raised the question of the legality of dual nationals holding government offices since Lakah was a national of both Egypt and France. In January 2001, the Minister of Interior officially declared that his election in 2000 was invalid. Discussions about his financial debts, which had started before his election, also intensified. His indebtedness amounting to 1.2 to 1.4 billion Egyptian Pounds with many government bankloans in Egypt unpaid. When lawsuits were filed against him, he fled Egypt and settled in France. In August 2001, a court verdict in Egypt ruled that he could not be a member of the Egyptian Parliament due to his dual nationality. In October 2004, the Egyptian parliament installed a new rule that dual nationals are not allowed to serve in the parliament. Lakah was once interviewed on AlJazeera satellite TV channel, bringing with him what he said is evidence that charges against him were politically motivated. The interview was cut short and Lakah stormed out of the studio [r√©f. n√©cessaire]. Lakah maintains that all his debts were paid off. In France, he took the name Raymond, instead of his Arabic birth name Rami, and started establishing himself in several business ventures, including Star Airlines, and in October 2004 he bought the France Soir newspaper. Cartoon controversy On February 2, 2006, France Soir published the Muhammad cartoons that caused a lot of havoc and anger among Muslims around the world. The cartoons were originally published by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten on September 30, 2005. France Soir republished the cartoons under the headline, \\"Yes, One has the Right to Caricature God.\\" The same day Raymond Lakah fired the editorial director, Jacques Lefranc. Le Monde reported that Lakah issued a statement saying he fired Lefranc as president and director of the newspaper in \\"a strong sign of respect to the intimate convictions and beliefs of each individual.\\" The statement continued, \\"We present our regrets to the Muslim community and to all people who have been shocked or made indignant by this publication.\\"  See also  *Lists of Egyptians *List of Copts *Coll√®ge de la Sainte Famille *France Soir ReferencesExternal links * Lakah-Group * Freedom‚Äôs Fighters * Al Ahram article on Lakah during 2000 elections. * Interview with Lakah hosted by Amr Adeeb in ALQAHERA ALYOUM live television show 4/12/2008 (in Arabic) * March 2002 article on Al Jazeera interview with Lakah (in Arabic).

He is best known for his 'Expositio in Cantica Canticorum', a complex commentary of the Song of Songs which includes an Old High German translation and a Latin verse paraphrase. Biography Williram came from a noble family in the Rhine area, related, among others, to the archbishop Heribert of Cologne (999‚Äì1021), the W√ºrzburg bishop Heinrich (995‚Äì1018), and the Eichst√§tt bishops Heribert (1022‚Äì1042) und Gezemann (1042). Ca.1020, he entered the Benedictine monastery Fulda, then in the 1040s became teacher in the Benedictine monastery Michelsberg in Bamberg, together among others with bishop Suidger, the future pope Clemens II. (1046‚Äì1047). Williram belonged to the court circle of emperor Henry III (1039‚Äì1056). In 1048, he became abbot at the Benedictine monastery of Ebersberg where he remained until his death 1085. He was a friend of the Benedictine abbot Wilhelm of Hirsau for whom he wrote a new version of the Life of Saint Aurelius, the patron saint of Hirsau.Discussion and edition of this in Henrike L√§hnemann: Reimprosa und Mischsprache bei Williram von Ebersberg.

Jahrhundert, ed. by Stephan M√ºller and Jens Schneider, M√ºnchen 2010 (Mittelalter Studien 20), pp. 205-237 Open access pre-print In the preface to his Expositio which he dedicated to Henry IV, Williram laments that, in Germany, grammar and dialectics are more popular than Biblical studies, praises Lanfranc devoting himself to the deeper study of the Bible and drawing many German scholars to France. The pages of his work are divided into three columns: The first contains a Latin paraphrase in Leonine hexameters of the Vulgate followed for each of the 150 paragraphs of the Song of Songs by a paraphrase of the prose commentary on the right hand side column; the second, the Vulgate text; and the third, an Old High German prose translation followed by a commentary in Latin-German mixed prose exposition. Williram describes his text as supporting the \\"body\\" of the Bible text which is marked up with the 'voces' of Christ, the Synagogue and the Church.On the layout and its literary implications cf.

Anti-vaccination activists promoting the incorrect claim that vaccination causes autism have asserted that the mercury in thiomersal is the cause. There is no scientific evidence to support this claim. The idea that thiomersal in vaccines might have detrimental effects originated with anti-vaccination activists and was sustained by them and especially through the action of plaintiffs' lawyers. The potential impact of thiomersal on autism has been investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause autism. For example, the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning differ significantly from those of autism. In addition, multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and autism, and rates of autism have continued to increase despite removal of thiomersal from vaccines. Thus, major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization (WHO) as well as governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In spite of the consensus of the scientific community, some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to autism and the claim is still stated as if it were fact in anti-vaccination propaganda, notably that of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., through his group Children's Health Defense. Thiomersal is no longer used in most children's vaccines in the United States, with the exception of some types of flu shots. While exposure to mercury may result in damage to brain, kidneys, and developing fetus, the scientific consensus is that thiomersal has no such effects. This controversy has caused harm due to parents attempting to treat their autistic children with unproven and possibly dangerous treatments, discouraging parents from vaccinating their children due to fears about thiomersal toxicity and diverting resources away from research into more promising areas for the cause of autism. Thousands of lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. to seek damages from alleged toxicity from vaccines, including those purportedly caused by thiomersal. US courts have ruled against multiple representative test cases involving thiomersal. A 2011 journal article described the vaccine-autism connection as \\"perhaps, the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years\\". History Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, especially in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a preservative in vaccines to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) determined that under the existing vaccination schedule \\"some children could be exposed to a cumulative level of mercury over the first 6 months of life that exceeds one of the federal guidelines on methyl mercury.\\"CDC PUBLISHES THIMEROSAL IN VACCINESNotice to Readers: Thimerosal in Vaccines They asked vaccine makers to remove thiomersal from vaccines as quickly as possible as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most US and EU vaccines, but is still used in multi-dose vials of flu vaccines in the U.S. No vaccines in the European Union currently contain thiomersal as a preservative.European Parliament: Community strategy concerning mercury (March 2006) In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism. It was introduced as a preservative in the 1930s to prevent the growth of infectious organisms such as bacteria and fungi, and has been in use in vaccines and other products such as immunoglobulin preparations and ophthalmic and nasal solutions. Vaccine manufacturers have used preservatives to prevent microbial growth during the manufacturing process or when packaged as \\"multi-dose\\" products to allow for multiple punctures of the same vial to dispense multiple vaccinations with less fear of contamination. After the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 mandated a review and risk assessment of all mercury-containing food and drugs, vaccine manufacturers responded to FDA requests made in December 1998 and April 1999 to provide detailed information about the thiomersal content of their preparations. A review of the data showed that while the vaccine schedule for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for the first six months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped. Upon conclusion of their review, the FDA, in conjunction with the other members of the US Public Health Service (USPHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), CDC and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), in a joint statement with the AAP in July 1999 concluded that there was \\"no evidence of harm caused by doses of thimerosal found in vaccines, except for local hypersensitivity reactions.\\" Despite the lack of convincing evidence of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action was based on the precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite the lack of evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza, meningococcal disease and tetanus. In 2004 Quackwatch posted an article saying that chelation therapy has been falsely promoted as effective against autism, and that practitioners falsified diagnoses of metal poisoning to \\"trick\\" parents into having their children undergo the process. , between 2‚Äì8% of children with autism had undergone the therapy. =Rationale for concern= Reports of autism cases per 1,000 children grew dramatically in the U.S. from 1996 to 2007. It is unknown how much, if any, growth came from changes in autism's prevalence. Although intended to increase public confidence in vaccinations, the decision to remove thiomersal instead led to some parents suspecting thiomersal as a cause of autism. This concern over a vaccine-autism link grew from a confluence of several underlying factors. First, methylmercury had for decades been the subject of widespread environmental and media concern after two highly publicized episodes of poisonings in the 1950s and 1960s in Minamata Bay, Japan from industrial waste and in the 1970s in Iraq from fungicide contamination of wheat. These incidents led to new research on methylmercury safety and culminated in the publication of an array of confusing recommendations by public health agencies in the 1990s warning against methylmercury exposure in adults and pregnant women, which ensured a continued high public awareness of mercury toxicity. Second, the vaccine schedule for infants expanded in the 1990s to include more vaccines, some of which, including the Hib vaccine, DTaP vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine, could have contained thiomersal. Third, the number of diagnoses of autism grew in the 1990s, leading parents of these children to search for an explanation for the apparent rise in diagnoses, including considering possible environmental factors. The dramatic increase in reported cases of autism during the 1990s and early 2000s is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, and it is unknown whether autism's true prevalence increased during the period. Nevertheless, some parents believed that there was a growing \\"autism epidemic\\" and connected these three factors to conclude that the increase in number of vaccines, and specifically the mercury in thiomersal in those vaccines, was causing a dramatic increase in the incidence of autism. Advocates of a thiomersal-autism link also relied on indirect evidence from the scientific literature, including analogy with neurotoxic effects of other mercury compounds, the reported epidemiologic association between autism and vaccine use, and extrapolation from in vitro experiments and animal studies. Studies conducted by Mark Geier and his son David Geier have been the most frequently cited research by parents advocating a link between thiomersal and autism. This research by Geier has received considerable criticism for methodological problems in his research, including not presenting methods and statistical analyses to others for verification, improperly analyzing data taken from Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, as well as either mislabelling or confusing fundamental statistical terms in his papers, leading to results that were \\"uninterpretable\\". =Publicity of concern= Several months after the recommendation to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote the theory that thiomersal caused autism. The controversy began to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the public and gained widening support within certain elements in the autism advocacy community as well as in the political arena, with U.S. Representative Dan Burton openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional hearings on the subject. Further support for the association between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the pharmaceutical industry, and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence of Harm, dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined the value of the article to the editors. Meanwhile, during this time of increased media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus that there is no convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that the media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation. Despite the consensus from experts that there is no link between thiomersal and autism, many parents continue to believe that such a link exists. These parents share the viewpoint that autism is not just treatable, but curable through \\"biomedical\\" interventions and have been frustrated by the lack of progress from more \\"mainline\\" scientists in finding this cure. Instead, they have supported an alternative community of like-minded parents, physicians and scientists who promote this belief. This mindset has taught these parents to challenge the expertise from the mainstream scientific community. Parents have also been influenced by an extensive network of anti-vaccination organizations such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Children's Health Defense and a large number of online anti-vaccination websites that present themselves as an alternative source for evidence using pseudoscientific claims. These websites use emotional appeals to gather support and frame the controversy as an adversarial dispute between parents and a conspiracy of doctors and scientists. Advocates for a thiomersal-autism link have also relied on celebrities like model Jenny McCarthy and information presented on Don Imus' Imus in the Morning radio show to persuade the public to their cause, instead of relying only on \\"dry\\" scientific papers and scientists. McCarthy has published a book describing her personal experience with her autistic son and appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to promote the hypothesis of vaccines causing autism. Bitterness over this issue has led to numerous threats made against the CDC as well as researchers like Offit, with increased security placed by the CDC in response to these threats. Scientific evaluation=Rationale for doubting link= Various lines of evidence undermine a proposed link between thiomersal and autism. For example, although advocates of a thiomersal-autism link consider autism a form of \\"mercury poisoning,\\" the typical symptoms of mercury toxicity are significantly different from symptoms seen in autism. Likewise, the neuroanatomic and histopathologic features of the brains of patients who have mercury poisoning, both with methylmercury as well as ethylmercury, have significant differences from the brains of people with autism. Previous episodes of widespread mercury toxicity in a population such as in Minamata Bay, Japan would also be expected to lead to documentation of a significant rise in autism or autism-like behavior in children should autism be caused by mercury poisoning. However, research on several episodes of acute and chronic mercury poisoning have not documented any such rise in autism-like behavior. Although some parents cite an association between the timing of onset of autistic symptoms with the timing of vaccinations as evidence of an environmental cause such as thiomersal, this line of reasoning can be misleading. Associations such as these do not establish causation as the two occurring together may be only coincidental in nature. Also, genetic disorders that have no environmental triggers such as Rett syndrome and Huntington's disease nevertheless have specific ages when they begin to show symptoms, suggesting specific ages of onset of symptoms does not necessarily require an environmental cause. Although the concern for a thiomersal-autism link was originally derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed. =Population studies= Multiple studies have been performed on data from large populations of children to study the relationship between the use of vaccines containing thiomersal, and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Almost all of these studies have found no association between thiomersal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and autism, and studies done after the removal of thiomersal from vaccines have nevertheless shown autism rates continuing to increase. The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews. In Europe, a cohort study of 467,450 Danish children found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs that would be suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention- deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels that occurred in the U.S. In North America, a Canadian study of 27,749 children in Quebec showed that thiomersal was unrelated to the increasing trend in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). In fact, the study noted that rates of PDDs were higher in the birth cohorts with no thiomersal when compared to those with medium or high levels of exposure. A study performed in the US which analyzed data from 78,829 children enrolled in HMOs taken from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) did not show any consistent association between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes, noting different results from data in different HMOs. A study performed in California found that removal of thiomersal from vaccines did not decrease the rates of autism, suggesting that thiomersal could not be the primary cause of autism. A study on children from Denmark, Sweden and California likewise argued against TCVs being causally associated with autism. =Scientific consensus= In 2001 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health asked the U.S. National Academy of Science's (NAS) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns. This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time, there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible. Since this report was released, several independent reviews have examined the body of published research for a possible thiomersal-autism link by examining the theoretical mechanisms of thiomersal causing harm and by reviewing the in vitro, animal, and population studies that have been published. These reviews determined that no evidence exists to establish thiomersal as the cause of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. The scientific consensus on the subject is reflected in a follow up report that was subsequently published in 2004 by the Institute of Medicine, which took into account new data that had been published since the 2001 report. The committee noted, in response to those who cite in vitro or animal models as evidence for the link between autism and thiomersal: > \\"However, the experiments showing effects of thimerosal on biochemical > pathways in cell culture systems and showing abnormalities in the immune > system or metal metabolism in people with autism are provocative; the autism > research community should consider the appropriate composition of the autism > research portfolio with some of these new findings in mind. However, these > experiments do not provide evidence of a relationship between vaccines or > thimerosal and autism. In the absence of experimental or human evidence that > vaccination (either the MMR vaccine or the preservative thimerosal) affects > metabolic, developmental, immune, or other physiological or molecular > mechanisms that are causally related to the development of autism, the > committee concludes that the hypotheses generated to date are theoretical > only.\\" The committee concludes: > \\"Thus, based on this body of evidence, the committee concludes that the > evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal- > containing vaccines and autism.\\" [bold in original] Further evidence of the scientific consensus includes the rejection of a causal link between thiomersal and autism by multiple national and international scientific and medical bodies including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the Canadian Paediatric Society, Also published (2007) in . the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the European Medicines Agency. A 2011 journal article reflects this point of view and described the vaccine-autism connection as \\"the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years\\". Consequences The suggestion that thiomersal has contributed to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders has had a number of effects. Public health officials believe fear driven by advocates of a thiomersal-autism link has caused parents to avoid vaccination or adopt \\"made up\\" vaccination schedules that expose their children to increased risk from preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis. Advocates of a thiomersal-autism link have also helped enact laws in six states (California, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New York and Washington) between 2004 and 2006 to limit the use of thiomersal given to pregnant women and children, although later attempts in 2009 in twelve other states failed to pass. These laws can be temporarily suspended, but vaccine advocates doubt their utility given the lack of evidence for danger with thiomersal in vaccines. Vaccine advocates are also concerned that passage of such laws help fuel a backlash against vaccination and contribute to doubts about the safety of vaccines that are unwarranted. During the period of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer. The notion that thiomersal causes autism has led some parents to have their children treated with costly and potentially dangerous therapies such as chelation therapy, which is typically used to treat heavy metal poisoning, due to parental fears that autism is a form of \\"mercury poisoning\\". As many as 2 to 8% of autistic children in the U.S., numbering as many as several thousand children per year, receive mercury-chelating agents. Although critics of using chelation therapy as an autism treatment point to a lack of any evidence to support its use, hundreds of doctors prescribe these medications despite possible side effects including nutritional deficiencies as well as damage to the liver and kidney. The popularity of this therapy caused a \\"public health imperative\\" that led the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to commission a study about chelation in autism by studying DMSA, a chelating agent used for lead poisoning, despite worries from critics that there would be no chance it would show positive results and it would be unlikely to convince parents to not use the therapy. Ultimately, the study was halted due to ethical concerns that there would be too much risk to children with autism who did not have toxic levels of mercury or lead due to a new animal study showing possible cognitive and emotional problems associated with DMSA. A 5-year-old autistic boy died from cardiac arrest immediately after receiving chelation therapy treatment using EDTA in 2005. The notion has also diverted attention and resources away from efforts to determine the causes of autism. The 2004 Institute of Medicine report committee recommended that while it supported \\"targeted research that focuses on better understanding the disease of autism, from a public health perspective the committee does not consider a significant investment in studies of the theoretical vaccine-autism connection to be useful at this time.\\" Alison Singer, a senior executive of Autism Speaks, resigned from the group in 2009 in a dispute over whether to fund more research on links between vaccination and autism, saying, \\"There isn't an unlimited pot of money, and every dollar spent looking where we know the answer isn't is one less dollar we have to spend where we might find new answers.\\" Court cases From 1988 until August 2010, 5,632 claims relating to autism were made to Office of Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (commonly known as the \\"Vaccine Court\\") which oversees vaccine injury claims, of which one case has received compensation, 738 cases have been dismissed with no compensations made, and with the remaining cases pending. In the one case which received compensation, the U.S. government agreed to pay for injury to a child that had a pre- existing mitochondrial disorder who developed autism-like symptoms after multiple vaccinations, some of which included thiomersal. Citing the inability to rule out a role of these vaccinations in exacerbating her underlying mitochondrial disorder as the rationale for payment, CDC officials cautioned against generalizing this one case to all autism-related vaccine cases as most patients with autism do not have a mitochondrial disorder. In February 2009, this court also ruled on three autism-related cases, each exploring different mechanisms that plaintiffs proposed linked thiomersal-containing vaccines with autism. Three judges independently found no evidence that vaccines caused autism and denied the plaintiffs compensation. Since these same mechanisms formed the basis for the vast majority of remaining autism-related vaccine injury cases, the chance for compensation in any of these cases has significantly decreased. In March 2010, the court ruled in three other test cases that thiomersal-containing vaccines do not cause autism.

DDEs are also called time-delay systems, systems with aftereffect or dead-time, hereditary systems, equations with deviating argument, or differential-difference equations. They belong to the class of systems with the functional state, i.e. partial differential equations (PDEs) which are infinite dimensional, as opposed to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) having a finite dimensional state vector. Four points may give a possible explanation of the popularity of DDEs: # Aftereffect is an applied problem: it is well known that, together with the increasing expectations of dynamic performances, engineers need their models to behave more like the real process. Many processes include aftereffect phenomena in their inner dynamics. In addition, actuators, sensors, and communication networks that are now involved in feedback control loops introduce such delays. Finally, besides actual delays, time lags are frequently used to simplify very high order models. Then, the interest for DDEs keeps on growing in all scientific areas and, especially, in control engineering. # Delay systems are still resistant to many classical controllers: one could think that the simplest approach would consist in replacing them by some finite-dimensional approximations. Unfortunately, ignoring effects which are adequately represented by DDEs is not a general alternative: in the best situation (constant and known delays), it leads to the same degree of complexity in the control design. In worst cases (time- varying delays, for instance), it is potentially disastrous in terms of stability and oscillations. # Voluntary introduction of delays can benefit the control system. # In spite of their complexity, DDEs often appear as simple infinite-dimensional models in the very complex area of partial differential equations (PDEs). A general form of the time-delay differential equation for x(t)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is :\\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=f(t,x(t),x_t), where x_t=\\\\\\\\{x(\\\\tau):\\\\tau\\\\leq t\\\\\\\\} represents the trajectory of the solution in the past. In this equation, f is a functional operator from \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\times C^1(\\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\mathbb{R}^n) to \\\\mathbb{R}^n.\\\\, Examples * Continuous delay ::\\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=f\\\\left(t,x(t),\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^0x(t+\\\\tau)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}\\\\mu(\\\\tau)\\\\right) * Discrete delay ::\\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=f(t,x(t),x(t-\\\\tau_1),\\\\dotsc,x(t-\\\\tau_m)) for \\\\tau_1>\\\\dotsb>\\\\tau_m\\\\geq 0. * Linear with discrete delays ::\\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=A_0x(t)+A_1x(t-\\\\tau_1)+\\\\dotsb+A_mx(t-\\\\tau_m) :where A_0,\\\\dotsc,A_m\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times n}. * Pantograph equation ::\\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t) = ax(t) + bx(\\\\lambda t), :where a, b and Œª are constants and 0 < Œª < 1\\\\. This equation and some more general forms are named after the pantographs on trains. Solving DDEs DDEs are mostly solved in a stepwise fashion with a principle called the method of steps. For instance, consider the DDE with a single delay ::\\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=f(x(t),x(t-\\\\tau)) with given initial condition \\\\phi\\\\colon [-\\\\tau,0]\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Then the solution on the interval [0,\\\\tau] is given by \\\\psi(t) which is the solution to the inhomogeneous initial value problem ::\\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}\\\\psi(t)=f(\\\\psi(t),\\\\phi(t-\\\\tau)), with \\\\psi(0)=\\\\phi(0). This can be continued for the successive intervals by using the solution to the previous interval as inhomogeneous term. In practice, the initial value problem is often solved numerically. =Example= Suppose f(x(t),x(t-\\\\tau))=ax(t-\\\\tau) and \\\\phi(t)=1. Then the initial value problem can be solved with integration, : x(t)=x(0)+ \\\\int_{s=0}^t \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(s) \\\\,{\\\\rm d}s =1+a\\\\int_{s=0}^t \\\\phi(s-\\\\tau)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}s, i.e., x(t)=at+1, where the initial condition is given by x(0)=\\\\phi(0)=1. Similarly, for the interval t\\\\in[\\\\tau,2\\\\tau] we integrate and fit the initial condition, : \\\\begin{align} x(t)=x(\\\\tau) & {} + \\\\int_{s=\\\\tau}^t \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(s) \\\\,{\\\\rm d}s = (a\\\\tau+1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} +a\\\\int_{s=\\\\tau}^t a(s-\\\\tau)+1 \\\\,{\\\\rm d}s = (a\\\\tau+1)+a\\\\int_{s=0}^{t-\\\\tau} as+1 \\\\,{\\\\rm d}s, \\\\end{align} i.e., x(t)=(a\\\\tau+1)+a(t-\\\\tau)\\\\left(\\\\frac{a(t-\\\\tau)}2 + 1\\\\right). Reduction to ODE  In some cases, differential equations can be represented in a format that looks like delay differential equations. * Example 1 Consider an equation :: \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=f\\\\left(t,x(t),\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^0x(t+\\\\tau)e^{\\\\lambda\\\\tau}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}\\\\tau\\\\right). :Introduce y(t)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^0x(t+\\\\tau)e^{\\\\lambda\\\\tau}\\\\,{\\\\rm d}\\\\tau to get a system of ODEs :: \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=f(t,x,y),\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}y(t)=x-\\\\lambda y. * Example 2 An equation :: \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=f\\\\left(t,x(t),\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^0x(t+\\\\tau)\\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\\\tau+\\\\beta)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}\\\\tau\\\\right) :is equivalent to :: \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=f(t,x,y),\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}y(t)=\\\\cos(\\\\beta)x+\\\\alpha z,\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}z(t)=\\\\sin(\\\\beta) x-\\\\alpha y, :where :: y=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^0x(t+\\\\tau)\\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\\\tau+\\\\beta)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}\\\\tau,\\\\quad z=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^0x(t+\\\\tau)\\\\sin(\\\\alpha\\\\tau+\\\\beta)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}\\\\tau. The characteristic equation Similar to ODEs, many properties of linear DDEs can be characterized and analyzed using the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation associated with the linear DDE with discrete delays ::\\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=A_0x(t)+A_1x(t-\\\\tau_1)+\\\\dotsb+A_mx(t-\\\\tau_m) is ::{\\\\rm det}(-\\\\lambda I+A_0+A_1e^{-\\\\tau_1\\\\lambda}+\\\\dotsb+A_me^{-\\\\tau_m\\\\lambda})=0. The roots Œª of the characteristic equation are called characteristic roots or eigenvalues and the solution set is often referred to as the spectrum. Because of the exponential in the characteristic equation, the DDE has, unlike the ODE case, an infinite number of eigenvalues, making a spectral analysis more involved. The spectrum does however have some properties which can be exploited in the analysis. For instance, even though there are an infinite number of eigenvalues, there are only a finite number of eigenvalues to the right of any vertical line in the complex plane. This characteristic equation is a nonlinear eigenproblem and there are many methods to compute the spectrum numerically. In some special situations it is possible to solve the characteristic equation explicitly. Consider, for example, the following DDE: :\\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d}t}x(t)=-x(t-1). The characteristic equation is :-\\\\lambda-e^{-\\\\lambda}=0.\\\\, There are an infinite number of solutions to this equation for complex Œª. They are given by :\\\\lambda=W_k(-1), where Wk is the kth branch of the Lambert W function.

It is located about southwest of Tehran.\\"Savah\\". 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. As of 2011, the city had a population of 259,030 people.Statistical Center of Iran: 2011 Iranian Population and Housing Census History In the 7th century BC it was a stronghold of the Medes. During the Parthian rule of Persia, it was called Saavakineh, and was one of the main hubs of the empire. In the Middle Ages, it was a residence of the Dailamites and of the Seljuqs. It was severely damaged by the Mongol invasion in the 13th century; it was restored during the Ilkhanids. Saveh was again sacked by the Timurids, but later grew under the Safavids. It eventually lost much of its importance when Tehran became the official capital of Persia and, in the mid-19th century, many of the inhabitants moved to Tehran. Climate Saveh has a cold semi-arid climate (BSk) in K√∂ppen-Geiger classification system. Its summers are very hot and dry, while its winters are mild and somewhat rainy. Main sights *Jameh Mosque of Saveh, built by the Seljuks during the 11th century. It includes a courtyard, porch, a 14 m tall minaret, nocturnal areas, a tiled dome (14 m tall, with a diameter of 16 m) and two altars with inscription in Kufic script. *Red Mosque of Saveh, also known as Enqelab Mosque. Dating to the Seljuk-era, it has a brickwork dome, an 11th-century minaret, three porticoes, and internally houses an altar with plasterwork and inscriptions. *Imamzadeh Soltan Seyed Eshaq Mausoleum *Sorkhdeh Bridge, south of the city *Khamseh-Abad caravansarai Outside the city are the fortresses of Esmaeilieh (35 km), Alvir and Ardemin (56 km, on the road to Hamadan), as well as the archaeological sites of Aveh and Alishar. Economy Saveh produces large amounts of wheat and cotton. It is also well known for its pomegranates and melons. Kaveh Industrial City, the largest industrial city in Iran, is located in Saveh. Legends According to Iranian tradition, the Magi who visited the infant Jesus traveled from Saveh, and are buried among its ruins. Marco Polo described the tombs of the Magi in his travel book, Il Milione: Saveh is said to have possessed one of the greatest libraries in the Middle East, until its destruction by the Mongols during their first invasion of Iran. Another legend about Saveh is the Lake of Saveh. It is a lake which is said to have been located near the city. According to the legend mentioned in historical Persian texts, this lake dried out on the night of the birth of Muhammad. A recent investigation in the Zarand area between Tehran and Saveh has revealed some evidence of the existence of this lake in Zarand Plain.Okhravi, R. and Djamali, M.

A Queensland State of Origin and Australian international representative of Aboriginal heritage, he played club football in Queensland, New South Wales and England. His playing career included a NSWRL Premiership win with Manly- Warringah in 1987 and a Rugby League World Cup Final win in 1988.

Shearer made his debut for Manly in round 1 of the season against Penrith, before going on to make his State of Origin d√©but for Queensland in the same year. Playing mostly on the wing or in the centres, Shearer played 22 games in his d√©but season for Manly, scoring 8 tries. It would prove to be the most number of club games he would play in a season in his 14-year career. He scored his first try for Manly at their home ground, Brookvale Oval, in their 24-4 win over the reigning premiers Canterbury- Bankstown in round 3. He made his test d√©but on the wing for Australia in 1986 against New Zealand at Carlaw Park in Auckland, scoring a try on debut.

In essence, it was a declaration of economic warfare by Britain as punishment to the American colonies for the rebellion against the King and British rule that became known as the American Revolutionary War. The Prohibitory Act references two acts passed by the last session of Parliament that were known as the Restraining Acts 1775. It was referenced as one of the 27 colonial grievances of the American Declaration of Independence.  Background  In October 1775, the Parliament of Great Britain, under Lord North, First Lord of the Treasury, decided that sterner measures would be taken to subdue the rebellion now underway in the 13 North American colonies. To that end, they decreed a blockade against the trade of the 13 colonists by passing the Prohibitory Act. \\"All manner of trade and commerce\\" would be prohibited, and any ship that was found trading \\"shall be forfeited to his Majesty, as if the same were the ships and effects of open enemies.\\" The goal was to destroy the American economy by prohibiting trade with any country. The Act, being a virtual declaration of war, furnished the colonists with an excuse for throwing off all allegiance to the king. John Adams regarded the Act as the straw that broke the camel's back.  Aftermath  The Prohibitory Act served as an effective declaration of war by Great Britain since a blockade is an act of war under the law of nations. The colonies and Congress immediately reacted by issuing letters of marque, which authorised individual American shipowners to seize British ships in a practice known as privateering. Further, the Act moved the American colonists more towards the option of complete independence, as the King had now declared his \\"subjects\\" out of his protection and levied war against them without regards to distinction as to their ultimate loyalty or their petitions for the redress of grievances. With the contemporaneous importation by the British of bands of foreign auxiliaries into the American colonies to suppress the rebellion by sack, pillage, fire, and the sword (the infamous Hessians), and the stirring up of hostile bands of Native Americans on the frontier by the King's men to raid the colonists, it became clear, even \\"self-evident,\\" to the colonists that they would not find liberty or security under the King's protection and so they exercised certain inalienable rights, and a rebellion turned into a war of national independence. The general reaction of the colonists, at least among Patriots, was an affirmed desire to fight back against the oppression of the British. Patrick Henry supposedly said, \\"Give me liberty or give me death!\\" The American people became more united in their struggle.

Lee. It stars Basil Rathbone as the future King Richard III of England, and Boris Karloff as his fictitious club-footed executioner Mord. The film is based on the traditional depiction of Richard rising to become King of England in 1483 by eliminating everyone ahead of him. Each time Richard accomplishes a murder, he removes one figurine from a dollhouse resembling a throneroom. Once he has completed his task, he now needs to defeat the exiled Henry Tudor to retain the throne. Tower of London was developed years before production began when Rowland V. Lee travelled to the United Kingdom to do research for a historical film and came up with the idea of developing a film about Richard III of England. Pressure was put on Lee to direct the film on time and on budget as his last two pictures had gone over budget and were not completed on schedule. Lee had problems when filming two battle scenes in the film which involved 400 extras when all their costumes were damaged by the studio rain machine. Production went over-budget and led to Lee making a deal with Universal to complete all scenes with the higher costing cast members early to finish the film. PlotCastProduction=Pre-production= Tower of London was originally conceived years before production when the producer and director Rowland V. Lee travelled to England to do research for an epic that involved British history. Lee's brother, Richard N. Lee then came up with the idea of developing a film about Richard III of England, with Richard later explaining that \\"We agreed that we wanted to use the roughest, most hard-boiled period of all time, Row was for the Stuart era but I held out for the time of Richard.\\" Rowland V. Lee presented the idea to Universal Pictures and The Hollywood Reporter announced in June 1939 that production was in plans to start. The studio gave the film a $500,000 budget with a 36-day shooting schedule that started on August 11. Trade papers stated on July 27 that Brian Donlevy was being tested for the lead role of Richard III with George Sanders being signed to the role one week later. Neither casting turned out when Lee approached Basil Rathbone for the role. Rathbone had previously worked with Lee on The Sun Never Sets and Love from a Stranger. Rathbone was pre-occupied by filming Rio at the time but was able to split his time between both productions during the first week of production. The role of Mord the Executioner was made for Boris Karloff who had signed on to the studio for two additional features after Son of Frankenstein. Initially, his character was to have a full black beard but this concept was removed in favour of a nearly hairless look. =Filming= Art director Jack Otterson developed a recreation of the tower in the studios backlot which involved consulting historical records and original blueprints of the 13th century building. The completed structure stood at 75 feet high and would later be re-used in other Universal Studios productions. The staging of historic battles at Bosworth and Tewkesbury lead to a call for over 300 extras on August 19 and required the production to travel 20 miles north of Hollywood to a ranch in Tarzana. Strongs winds and caused problems with the fog machines used making it impossible to film. Lee had the crew move on to film the Battle of Tewkesbury scenes, which involved rain machines that made the extras cardboard helmets fall apart. The assistant director of the film stated in his film diary that \\"a group of unruly, uncoooperative and destructive extras dressed in helmets and armor made this one of the most unsuccessful days the studio had with a large crowd of people in many year.\\" Lee attempted to shoot battle footage again on August 22 and tried to film small groups of actors against process plates of previously shot battle scenes. As Lee's last two films for Universal exceeded their original budget, pressure was placed on Lee to cut some costs on Tower of London. Universal told Lee to remove the child marriage scene which Lee fought against. The studio and Lee eventually agreed to finish all scenes with the higher-salaried actors, starting with Karloff. Production completed on Tower of London on September 4. The budget was exceeded by nearly $80,000. Ford Beebe signed on to complete a few remaining shots. =Film score= For the score of the film Hans J. Salter used authentic period music for incidental music. When a preview screening for the film was shown in early November 1939, studio heads at Universal demanded new music written, but due to a lack of time, music from Frank Skinner's Son of Frankenstein was used, including a slightly altered title theme. Release Tower of London was distributed theatrically by Universal Pictures on 17 November 1939. The film inspired a remake in 1962 with United Artists signing Roger Corman to direct Tower of London. This film, along with Night Key, The Climax, The Strange Door and The Black Castle, was released on DVD in 2006 by Universal Studios as part of The Boris Karloff Collection. On December 17, 2019 it was released in high definition on blu ray as part of Scream Factory‚Äôs Universal Horror Collection Volume 3. Reception From contemporary reviews, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Rowland V. Lee \\"has turned in probably the finest effort in his career. He has executed the difficult feat of making this type of picture human personal, building powerfully to his climaxes, injecting curiously apt touches of humor, crowning the effort with the power, spectacular battle scenes.\\" A reviewer in Time found the film \\"less authentic than its elaborately spooky reproductions of London's Tower...But the battles of Tewkesbury and Bosworth set a new high for realistic racket than should deafen the most demanding.\\" Variety stated that the film \\"so strong that it may provide disturbing nightmares as aftermath\\" and that \\"Rathbone provides a most vivid portrayal of the ambitious Duke\\" Frank Nugent of The New York Times found the film \\"all too painful and pointless\\" noting that \\"Karloff can't be taken seriously\\" and that \\"even the Rialto's audience, which no one dare accuse of hypsersensitivyt, grew silent after a while and stopped applauding Mr. Rathbone's villainies. He was almost too bad to be true.\\" When actors and crew involved in the picture later discussed the film, Vincent Price stated that he \\"saw it again only recently and found it ponderous but interesting. The drinking match was all ad-libbed and had to be done in very few shots to heighten credibility. We shot it all in one day.\\" Assistant editor Paul Landres stated that \\"We thought we had an Academy Award picture, we really did. Each scene was remarkable. [...] And then we saw the first cut and, man, that picture died. And the reason it died was that every scene came up to its peak, and there was nothing but peaks in the whole film. There was no pacing, there was no change. Boy, did I learn. I really learned from that one.\\" From retrospective reviews, Hans J. Wollstein of AllMovie stated that \\"Karloff employs all kinds of instruments of torture, but very little actual torture is shown\\" and found that \\"with the likes of Karloff, Basil Rathbone, and a very young Vincent Price taking turns chewing the scenery, it is also vastly entertaining\\" as well as that \\"the battle scenes are so much more intimate and thus interesting for Universal's lack of elaborate staging.\\" See also * Boris Karloff filmography * Vincent Price filmography * List of historical drama films * Politics in fiction References=FootnotesSources=  *  External links   * Turner Classic Movies review with production notes Category:1939 films Category:1930s historical films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films set in the 1480s Category:Films set in the 15th century Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in England Category:Films directed by Rowland V.

Simms played his entire first grade career for South Sydney with whom he won four premierships and was top point- scorer for four consecutive seasons. In August 2008, Simms was named at fullback in the Indigenous Team of the Century. Simms set several records in his playing days, some which still stand. He was a notable goal-kicker (field, penalty and conversion) who once kicked five field goals in eleven minutes (in a match against Penrith in 1969). It has been said of Simms, and specifically his ability to kick field goals, that he's \\"one of the few men whose influence was such it single-handedly changed the game\\". Early life and education Eric Simms was born in Karuah, New South Wales on 2 August 1945, the eldest son John (Jack) Simms, an Ullugundy Island man, who came to Karuah to live for a while before moving to La Perouse in Sydney. Eric's mother was born Gwendoline May Cook and became Gwendoline Ping when her own mother remarried. Eric and his sister, Beverley, grew up on the former Aboriginal reserve at Karuah, raised by his mother and stepfather, Fred Ridgeway, along with six other younger brothers and sisters. Simms had a total of thirteen siblings although some died at birth.Beverley Manton, in Aboriginal Women‚Äôs Heritage: Port Stephens, June 2004, The National Parks and Wildlife Service, [www.environment.nsw.gov.au New South Wales Department of Environment and Conservation], Hurstville, Eric attended Karuah Public School,Alison Branley, \\"History lessons\\", The Newcastle Herald, 22 August 2009, p 6, via factiva and Raymond Terrace High School where \\"he was taught the art of goalkicking by Les Leggatt, sportsmaster\\".Grantlee Kieza, \\"Uncovered - what happened next\\", The Daily Telegraph (Sydney), 30 July 2004, p B25 via factiva accessed 1 September 2011.

In 1969, he broke the record for the most points scored in a premiership season with 265, previously held by Dave Brown of Eastern Suburbs. He held the record until broken by Mick Cronin over a decade later. In 1973 he overtook Keith Barnes' record for the most points scored in an NSWRFL career (1,519); Simms' eventual total of 1,841 stood as the new career record for ten seasons until it was surpassed by Graham Eadie in 1983. =Club records= Simms set and still holds a number of South Sydney club records: * Most points in first grade career: 1841 points (23 tries, 803 goals, 86 field goals); * Most first grade points in a season: 265 points in 1969 (1 try, 112 goals, 19 field goals); * Most goals in first grade career: 890; * Most goals in a first grade season: 131 in 1969; * Most goals in a first grade game: 11 against Cronulla, 11 April 1969 and against Penrith, 27 July 1969.

He scored 50 points in four games at the 1968 World Cup, a record which still stands today. He played in the 1970 World Cup in England two years later and scored 37 points in total. The final, played at Leeds in November, 1970 has been described \\"as the most savage international ever played\\" and \\"a running brawl\\"; after the full-time whistle, with Australia having won, Simms offered a handshake to the English winger, John Atkinson, who responded by head-butting Simms.\\"100 Most Dramatic Moments in Rugby League History\\", Part 1 of 4, Sunday Telegraph (Sydney), 18 March 2007, p R01 via factiva accessed 3 September 2011. =Coaching career= After the 1975 season, Simms moved to Crookwell, New South Wales, with his wife Sue and three children, Brendon, Kristie and Simone where he was captain-coach in 1976 until an arm injury (sustained in a tackle) forced his playing retirement at age 31.

Ron Coote has said that Simms' kicking ability was a combination of talent and hard work: \\"Eric would get to training and stand on the halfway line and Clive Churchill would stand under the posts ... . Eric would practise field goals from halfway one after the other for half an hour. Bang, bang, bang straight over. He hardly ever missed.\\" Simms has said: \\"Of course anyone can do it in training but it's harder when people are charging at you and the crowd is booing. Often I'd have to kick from weird angles under all sorts of pressure. Against Wests once I remember Mick Alchin coming around from the scrumbase to flatten me just as I took a shot. He hit me so hard that I went up in the air and came down flat on my back. But I was watching the ball go between the posts. I must have timed the kick just right.\\" Of the field goal rule change, he has said: \\"I never really believed the league changed the rule because of me ... . But over the years so many people told me I was the cause that there must be something to it.\\" Awards and honours In 2001 he was named in the Indigenous Team of the Century at the Eric Simms Challenge - A Tribute to Indigenous Rugby League, Redfern Oval, June 2001.Mike Gandon, \\"Russo locked in as a Koori great\\", Illawarra Mercury, 20 June 2001, p 60, Fairfax News Store accessed 2 September 2011.

John is a former professional and national representative rugby league footballer who played in the 1960s and 1970s. He was a rugged Prop forward who captained his club, South Sydney to four premiership victories from 1967 to 1971 and who played four Tests for Australia ‚Äì three as national captain. Known as \\"Satts\\", he was one of the hardmen of Australian rugby league and was regarded an aggressive on field player but a softly spoken gentleman off the field - hence his other nickname \\"Gentleman John\\". His son Scott Sattler was also a professional rugby league footballer and won a national premiership with the Penrith Panthers in 2003. Club career Born in Kurri Kurri, New South Wales, Sattler began playing rugby league at the late age of 16 for Kurri Kurri and represented Newcastle against the touring British side in 1962. The following year he moved to Sydney and joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs. In 1967 he was appointed Souths captain and he inspired Souths to premiership wins in the four seasons of 1967, 1968, 1970 and 1971. He also led his team to the Grand Final in 1969 where they lost to Balmain. His could play at lock forward but played his best football and enjoyed his premiership & national representative success as a Prop forward. After 195 games with South Sydney, and four premiership victories, John Sattler signed for Brisbane Western Suburbs in 1973. =The 1970 Grand Final= In the 1970 grand final, Sattler played with a broken jaw to help Souths to victory over Manly. In the premiership decider of 1970 South Sydney were up against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 19 September. Having lost the previous Grand Final to the Balmain Tigers, Souths were desperate to win. Approximately ten minutes into the game Sattler collapsed after being punched by Manly forward John Bucknall. He suffered a double fracture to his jaw but pleaded to team mate Mike Cleary, \\"Hold me up so they don't know I'm hurt\\". He was helped up and continued to play in the game. At half time Souths were leading 12‚Äì6 when his team mates learnt about his injury. During the interval he refused treatment and insisted he continue playing. He also told the side, \\"the next bloke who tries to cut me out of the play is in trouble,\\" to prevent his team mates trying to protect him from further injury. At the end of the game South Sydney had scored 3 tries to nil in a 23‚Äì12 victory. He later went to hospital to receive treatment but only after receiving the Giltinan Shield and making an acceptance speech. Representative career Being injured during the 1970 Grand Final, he was not selected as captain for the Australian touring side announced later that night for the World Cup in England. However he had previously been selected in Australia's tour of Britain and France in 1967 and in the Australian teams which toured New Zealand in 1969 and 1971, in which he was selected as captain. He only managed to play in four tests for Australia, captaining his nation in three out of those four games. He captained the Queensland state side against New South Wales in 1973 before retiring from professional rugby league the following year. Sattler was sent off fifteen times during his career and served a total of 30 weeks of suspensions. But he is remembered for his physical and mental toughness rather than his poor disciplinary record. Post playing In the mid-1980s John Sattler was involved in one of the unsuccessful bids to form a Brisbane-based team for the New South Wales Rugby League premiership. In February 2008, Sattler was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. In 2010 he was named as captain of Kurri Rugby League Club's team of the century.

The name itself means bamboo river in the Malay language. It is located 16 km NW of downtown Kuala Lumpur and 8 km north of the Subang Airport, along the Kuala Selangor highway. Bordering Damansara, Kepong, Kuang and Kuala Selangor, Sungai Buloh is notable for its colonial-era leper colony, one of the largest in the country. History No clear historical records regarding Sungai Buloh's founding and settlement were available, though railway services had reached Sungai Buloh by the 1890s. Many believe that Sungai Buloh got its name from Sungai Buloh river that flows from Strait of Malacca through Kuala Selangor District. A town in Jeram in Kuala Selangor where the estuary of Sungai Buloh begins was also named after the river. In 1930, in an isolated valley of Bukit Lagong, Sungai Buloh, a group of Malays, Chinese, Indians, Eurasians and Turks set up a contained community in the wake of the 1926 Leper Enactment Act, which required the segregation and treatment of those with the disease. Sungai Buloh was at one point, the second biggest leprosy settlement in the world. It was equipped with advanced facilities and remained a research centre for leprosy until today. Sungei Buloh was a pioneer project based on the \\"enlightened policy\\" of segregating leprosy patients in a self-supporting community following the principles of a garden city. In 1935 and 1936, scrip (voucher) was issued specifically for the settlement. Sungai Buloh was the site of the Bright Sparklers Firework factory explosion in May 1991 and the subsequent fire. Geography=Location and geographical definition= Sungai Buloh is located at the northern quarter of the Petaling Region, bordering Damansara, Subang, Kuang and Kepong (across the Selangor-Federal Territory border). Neighbourhoods and residential areas of Sungai Buloh include: * Bukit Rahman Putra * Damansara Damai * Bandar Sri Damansara * Bandar Baru Sungai Buloh * Paya Jaras * Desa Aman * Kwasa Damansara * Taman Villa Putra * Sierramas, and * Valencia. Most of these neighbourhoods are guarded and gated to provide the safest hospitality for the residents. Though often included as part of Sungai Buloh, the wards of Matang Pagar, Bandar Saujana Utama and Bandar Sri Coalfields, are actually part of the neighbouring towns of Kuang and Kuala Selangor respectively. The nearby township of Kota Damansara, though rarely included as part of Sungai Buloh, falls under the same parliamentary constituency as Sungai Buloh itself. Education There are currently three public high schools in Sungai Buloh ‚Äì SMK Bandar Baru Sungai Buloh, SMK Bukit Rahman Putra and SMK Sierramas. Sungai Buloh also houses two international schools, namely IGB International School, behind the railway/metro station, and ELC International School, in Sierramas. Accessibility Sungai Buloh railway station =Public transport= Sungai Buloh railway station is the main railway station serving the town. Served by the Port Klang Line of KTM Komuter, it is also the first station of the MRT Kajang Line. Limited KTM ETS high speed rail services are also available. =Car= The Kepong-Kuala Selangor highway runs through Sungai Buloh area, intersecting with Highway (to Subang Airport and Subang Jaya). PLUS exit 113 serves the city. Governance=Local authority= Due to its unclear geographical definition, what is considered as Sungai Buloh, falls under jurisdiction of four local authorities: * Majlis Bandaraya Shah Alam (Shah Alam City Council, MBSA), covering Bukit Rahman Putra, Kampung Baru Sungai Buloh, the Sungai Buloh military base, Paya Jaras, and Kwasa Damansara. * Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya (Petaling Jaya City Council, MBPJ), covering Kampung Selamat, Bandar Sri Damansara, Damansara Damai, and the railway/MRT station. * Majlis Perbandaran Selayang (Selayang Municipal Council, MPS), covering Hospital Sungai Buloh, Valencia, Sierramas, Taman Matang Jaya and Taman Impian Indah and the Sungai Buloh Prison complex. Note that these locations are closer to, and often included as part of, Kuang, rather than Sungai Buloh. * Majlis Daerah Kuala Selangor (Kuala Selangor District Council, MDKS), covering some far western areas near Puncak Alam such as Bandar Saujana Utama and Bandar Seri Coalfields. These areas are technically not part of Sungai Buloh. =Politics= Sungai Buloh lends its name to, and is represented by the Sungai Buloh parliamentary constituency. The bulk of Sungai Buloh town is within the Paya Jaras state constituency, which is also one of two state seats in the parliamentary constituency; though part of the town also spills into neighbouring Selayang constituency.

Clin Pharmacokinet. 1997 Dec;33(6):418. and is available in many countries. It is the only local anaesthetic to contain a thiophene ring, meaning it can be described as 'thiophenic'; this conveys lipid solubility. History This drug was first synthesized by Rusching in 1969,Malamed SF. Handbook of local anaesthesia, p. 71, 5th ed. St. Louis, Mosby; 2004. and brought to the market in Germany by Hoechst AG, a life-sciences German company, under the brand name Ultracain. This drug was originally referred to as \\"carticaine\\" until 1984. In 1983 it was brought into the North American market, to Canada, under the name Ultracaine for dental use, manufactured in Germany and distributed by Hoechst- Marion-Roussel. This brand is currently manufactured in Germany by Sanofi- Aventis and distributed in North America by Hansamed Limited (since 1999). After Ultracaine's patent protection expired, new generic versions arrived to the Canadian market: (in order of appearance) Septanest (Septodont), Astracaine, (originally by AstraZeneca and now a Dentsply product), Zorcaine (Carestream Health/Kodak) and Orabloc (Pierrel). It was approved by the FDA in April 2000, and became available in the United States of America two months later under the brand name Septocaine, an anesthetic/vasoconstrictor combination with Epinephrine 1:100,000 (trade name Septodont). Zorcaine became available there a few years later, also. Articadent (Dentsply) became available in the United States in October 2010. The three brands currently available in the United States are all manufactured for these companies by Novocol Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Canada). Ubistesin and Ubistesin Forte (3M ESPE) are also widely used in the United States and Europe. Orabloc (Pierrel) is aseptically manufactured and was approved by the FDA in 2010, became available in Canada in 2011, and in Europe from 2013.

However, version with epinephrine (adrenaline) is available in Europe under the brand name Supracain 4% with epinephrine concentration of 1:200,000. Structure and metabolism The amide structure of articaine is similar to that of other local anesthetics, but its molecular structure differs through the presence of a thiophene ring instead of a benzene ring. Articaine is exceptional because it contains an additional ester group that is metabolized by esterases in blood and tissue. The elimination of articaine is exponential with a half-life of 20 minutes.HornkeI, Eckert HG, Rupp W. Pharnakokinetik und Metabolismus von Articain nach intramuskularer Injektion am mannlichen Probanden. Dtsch Z Mund Kiefer Gesichts Chir 1984; 8:67-71Kirch W, Kitteringham N, Lambers G, et al. Die klinische Pharmakokinetik von Articain nach intraoraler und intramuskularer Application. Schweiz Monatsschr Zahnheilkd 1983; 93: 713-9 Since articaine is hydrolized very quickly in the blood, the risk of systemic intoxication seems to be lower than with other anesthetics, especially if repeated injection is performed.Oertel R, Ebert U, Rahn R, Kirch W. Clinical pharmacokinetics of articaine. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1997 Dec;33(6):420. Clinical use Articaine is used for pain control. Like other local anesthetic drugs, articaine causes a transient and completely reversible state of anesthesia (loss of sensation) during (dental) procedures.Malamed SF. Handbook of local anaesthesia, p. 3, 5th ed. St. Louis, Mosby; 2004. In dentistry, articaine is used mainly for infiltration injections. Articaine, while not proven, has been associated with higher risk of nerve damage when used as a block technique.Pogrel MA. Permanent nerve damage from inferior alveolar nerve blocksan update to include articaine. J Calif Dent Assoc. 2007 Apr;35(4):271-3. However, articaine is able to penetrate dense cortical bone  as found in the lower jaw (mandible)  more than most other local anaesthetics. In people with hypokalemic sensory overstimulation, lidocaine is not very effective, but articaine works well. Studies comparing lidocaine and articaine found that articaine is more effective than lidocaine in anaesthetising the posterior first molar region. Articaine has been found to be 3.81 times more likely than lidocaine to produce successful anaesthesia when used for infiltration injections. However, there is no evidence to support the use of articaine over lidocaine for inferior alveolar nerve blocks.

Paresthesia controversy Paresthesia, a short-to-long-term numbness or altered sensation affecting a nerve, is a well- known complication of injectable local anesthetics and has been present even before articaine was available.Pogrel MA, Bryan J, Regezi J.

A 21 year retrospective study of reports of paresthesia following local anesthetic administration. J Can Dent Assoc. 1995 Apr;61(4):319-20, 323-6, 329-30. seems to be the original source for the controversy surrounding articaine. This paper analyzed 143 cases reported in to the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario (RCDSO) over a 21-year period. The results from their analysis seemed to indicate that 4% local anesthetics had a higher incidence of causing paresthesia, an undesirable temporary or permanent complication, after the injection. The authors concluded that ‚Äú...the overall incidence of paresthesia following local anesthetic administration for non-surgical procedures in dentistry in Ontario is very low, with only 14 cases being reported out of an estimated 11,000,000 injections in 1993. However if paresthesia does occur, the results of this study are consistent with the suggestion that it is significantly more likely to do so if either articaine or prilocaine is used.‚Äù In another paper by the same authors,Haas DA, Lennon D. A review of local anesthetic-induced paraesthesia in Ontario in 1994. J Dent Res 1996; 75(Special Issue):247. 19 reported paresthesia cases in Ontario for 1994 were reviewed, concluding that the incidence of paresthesia was 2.05 per million injections of 4% anesthetic drugs. Another follow up study by Miller and Haas published in 2000,Miller PA, Haas DA. Incidence of local anesthetic-induced neuropathies in Ontario from 1994‚Äì1998. J Dent Res 2000; 79 (Special Issue):627. concluded that the incidence of paresthesia from either prilocaine or articaine (the only two 4% drugs in the dental market) was close to 1:500,000 injections. (An average dentist gives around 1,800 injections in a year.Haas DA, Lennon D Local anaesthetic use by dentists in Ontario. J Can Dent Assoc. 1995 Apr;61(4):297-304) Almost all recorded cases of long-term numbness or altered sensation (paresthesia) seem only to be present when this anesthetic is used for dental use (no PubMed references for paresthesia with articaine for other medical specialties). Also, in the vast majority of the reports, only the lingual nerve was affected. Nonetheless, direct damage to the nerve caused by 4% drugs has never been scientifically proven.Malamed SF.

John Hall Wheelock was born in Far Rockaway, New York, and brought up in the neighborhood now occupied by Rockefeller Center. He summered in a family home on Long Island's South Fork, which provided inspiration for much of his work. Wheelock's parents encouraged the reading and memorization of poetry, and told of the time when they had seen the great poet Walt Whitman, when John was a baby. John Hall Wheelock graduated from Harvard University in 1908, and was class poet. As a student, he was editor-in-chief of The Harvard Monthly, and published his first work, Verses by Two Undergraduates, anonymously with his friend Van Wyck Brooks during their freshman year. In 1910, he began work with Charles Scribner and Sons and by 1947 had risen to the position of senior editor. During his career he worked with such distinguished authors as Thomas Wolfe and James Truslow Adams and is noted for discovering poets May Swenson and James Dickey. Wheelock's published volume of Collected Works was awarded the Golden Rose by the New England Poetry Society in 1936, as the most distinguished contribution to American poetry of that year. For his work Poems Old and New he received the Ridgely Torrence Memorial Award in 1956, and the Borestone Mountain Poetry Award in 1957. In 1962 he won the Bollingen Prize; in 1965 the Signet Society Medal, Harvard University, for distinguished achievement in the arts. In 1972 he was awarded the Gold Medal by the Poetry Society of America for notable achievement in poetry. John Hall Wheelock was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Poetry Society of America (Vice president, 1944-1946), National Institute of Arts and Letters (vice-president), and the Academy of American Poets (chancellor, 1947‚Äì71; honorary fellow, 1974-1978). He was an honorary consultant in American letters to the Library of Congress. In 1940, John Hall Wheelock married Phyllis E. DeKay, the daughter of Charles DeKay, poet and art critic.

Like most in his position, he studied for the gwageo in order to gain a position of rank; but failed in his first attempt in 1705.

Yi Ik followed in Yu Hyeong-won line of thought extending in this work Seongho Saseol, which covers subjects as government, economy, and the family, and makes detailed proposals for reordering each aspect of Joseon society. His most famous work was Record of Concern for the Underprivileged which lays down the cardinal principles of reform ideas.

Damico discovers that the victim of the shooting was a witness who was to have appeared before a grand jury investigating waterfront crime, and that the same man who shot him also murdered the chief investigator on the case just a few hours earlier (which is where the badge came from). Damico could lose his job, but instead he's given the chance to redeem himself‚Äîhe's sent undercover and given a new identity as New Orleans tough-guy Tim Flynn, who insinuates himself onto the New York waterfront when he arrives on ship. He manages to hook up with union thug Joe Castro (Ernest Borgnine) and his strong-arm man Gunner (Neville Brand), who try to frame him for a murder that also gets a potential stoolie Culio (Frank DeKova) out of the way and that hooks Damico up with crooked police sergeant Bennion (Walter Klavun) who arrests him.

It is adapted from the novel Waterfront by Ferguson Findley and directed with a flair for lively action scenes by Robert Parrish. This ordinary minor film noir holds together until one twist too many turns it into one of those old movie theater chapter serial-like endings ... Broderick Crawford is believable in this heroic role and moves his character into a noir figure by his hard-boiled, no-nonsense approach to the dangerous situation, where he's not in control of his destiny. Ernest Borgnine has the natural look of a shady individual to give his role a sinister force. Neville Brand as a strong-arm enforcer for Borgnine adds to the violent atmosphere. The film has fistfights, tough talking thugs and cops, and a bleak view of the corrupt docks. The brutality of both the criminals and the police is what gives the film its shock value and special feel. Otherwise it's your ordinary violent crime film.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

Later studying under the acclaimed aviation artist Attila Hejja, Scott was well prepared for his emergence into illustration. For the past 20 years he's been a trendsetter in the publishing field working with most of the major Science Fiction and Fantasy publishers while creating a balance between his classical training and digital techniques. He is perhaps best known for his work on author Mike Shepherd‚Äôs Kris Longknife series including over 30 covers for his Jump Universe. As a fine artist he was widely known for his Victorian Fairy paintings. His recent re-emergence as a painter has taken on a life of its own, exploring Symbolism, Surrealist and Mythological themes.

A native of Mississippi and member of the Democratic Party, Chamberlain's political achievements included appointment followed by election as the first Attorney General of Oregon, a stint as the state's 11th Governor, and two terms in the United States Senate in Washington, DC. Biography=Early life= George Earle Chamberlain was born in Natchez, Mississippi, on January 1, 1854. The Chamberlain family were early immigrants to North America from England, helping to pioneer in the state of Massachusetts.Chapman Publishing Company, \\"Hon. George E. Chamberlain \\", Portrait and Biographical Record of the Willamette Valley Oregon, 1903 Part-1/2, Pg. 37 His father, Dr. Charles Thomson Chamberlain, was born in Delaware and attended medical school in Philadelphia before moving to the small southern town of Natchez in 1837, attracted by the prospects offered there for a newly coined medical practitioner. Dr. Chamberlain quickly built a large and prosperous practice, which enabled him to maintain his Maryland-born wife, the former Pamelia H. Archer, and family in comfort. Pamelia Archer herself hailed from an illustrious pioneer family, being the granddaughter of Maryland Congressman John Archer (1741‚Äì1810), the daughter of Maryland Congressman Stevenson Archer Sr. (1786‚Äì1848), and the sister of Maryland Congressman Stevenson Archer Jr. (1827‚Äì1898). George Earle Chamberlain was the couple's third child. George Earle Chamberlain attended public schools in Natchez, completing his secondary education in 1870 at the age of 16.Chapman Publishing Company, \\"Hon. George Earle Chamberlain \\", Portrait and Biographical Record of the Willamette Valley Oregon, 1903 Part-1/2, Pg. 38 Following graduation he first worked two years as a clerk in a general merchandise store before leaving for Washington and Lee University in 1872. Chamberlain successfully complete the course of work there, graduating with dual degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Law in July 1876, gaining membership in Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in the process. Following graduation from Washington and Lee, Chamberlain briefly returned home to Natchez but decided that professional prospects in the post-bellum South were marginal at best and he departed for a new life in Oregon, arriving on December 6, 1876. Chamberlain's first job in the west was a brief and poor- paying stint as the teacher of a country school in Linn County, Oregon. Late in 1877 he was appointed deputy clerk of Linn County, remaining in that position until the summer of 1879. In the interim he passed the Oregon state bar, enabling him to practice law in the state. In 1879, Chamberlain married Sallie Newman Welch, with whom he would have seven children. He was widowed on May 26, 1925.George Chamberlain (1854-1928) - The Oregon Encyclopedia. In 1878 he served in the Linn County Rifles, a volunteer militia formed to fight against belligerents from the Bannock, Shoshone, and Paiute peoples in the so- called Bannock War.Michael Robert Patterson, \\"George Earle Chamberlain Sr.: Governor of Oregon, United States Senator,\\" Arlington National Cemetery website, www.arlingtoncemetery.net/ =Political career= Chamberlain during his tenure in the 1920s A member of the Democratic Party, Chamberlain ran for the Oregon House of Representatives in November 1880, winning election to a two-year term. In 1884, Chamberlain was named district attorney for Oregon's 3rd judicial district. His skill in that position gained the notice of Democratic Governor Sylvester Pennoyer and when in 1891 the state legislature established the new position of Oregon Attorney General, Chamberlain was appointed in May as the first to serve that position. He stood for election to the position in the fall, winning at the polls despite being the candidate of the minority party in the state. Chamberlain would remain Oregon's Attorney General until January 1895, following the expiration of his term. He would be the only Democrat to serve that position for 58 years, until Robert Y. Thornton was elected in 1952. After leaving the Oregon Attorney General's position, Chamberlain went into the banking business, taking positions with the First National Bank and later the Linn County National Bank in his new hometown of Albany. Chamberlain next moved north to Portland and in 1900 stood for election as the district attorney for Multnomah County. He won a more than 1,000 votes, despite the county's 4,000 person Republican majority. This again put Chamberlain in the public eye for a run at statewide office. =Governor of Oregon= In 1902, he was nominated by the Democratic Party of Oregon for Governor by acclamation at the party's nominating convention. Chamberlain was elected Governor of Oregon in a tight election by just 256 votes, this in a state which delivered 15,000 more votes to the Republicans in the concurrent congressional elections. Chamberlain was reelected in 1906, resigning his term when elected to the Senate. =United States Senator= In 1908 he was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate; he was reelected in 1914 and served from March 4, 1909, to March 4, 1921. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the Senate in 1920; while a Senator, he was chairman of the Committee on Geological Survey (Sixty-second Congress) and a member of the Committee on Military Affairs (Sixty-third through Sixty-fifth Congresses), the Committee on Public Lands (Sixty-third Congress), and the Committee on Expenditures in the War Department (Sixty-sixth Congress). The Chamberlain Military Preparedness Bill of 1918, which he wrote, bears his name. =Death and legacy= He was a member of the United States Shipping Board from 1921 to 1923 and engaged in the practice of law in Washington, D.C. Chamberlain married his longtime personal secretary, Carolyn B. Shelton, on July 12, 1926 in Norfolk, Virginia. Chamberlain died there on July 9, 1928, and interment was in Arlington National Cemetery. During his life Chamberlain was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias, and was a 32nd degree Mason in Portland. He was also a member of the Commercial Club of Portland, the Multnomah Athletic Club, the Oregon Historical Society, and was a life member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.Chapman Publishing Company, \\"Hon.

Yakuza and gambling are recurring themes in his manga. In English-speaking countries, he is known best as the author of Akagi, a mahjong-related manga. In 1998, he won the Kodansha Manga Award for Gambling Apocalypse: Kaiji. An onomatopoeia \\"zawa\\" (), meaning an uneasy atmosphere, appears frequently in his comics and is considered Fukumoto's trademark. Career Fukumoto was born in Kanagawa Prefecture and grew up reading Perman and other sh≈çnen manga as a child, as well as studying karate and kickboxing due to wanting to get stronger. In high school, he went on to study architecture, and in his own words, he was \\"a dazed student, neither good nor a delinquent.\\" After graduating, got a job as a site foreman at a construction company, but found the work boring and decided to become a manga artist to try and get a big break in life. During this time, when he pitched a kendo manga to Kodansha, he was advised to work as an assistant to gain some experience first. He began working under , who was looking for assistants at the time, and quit the construction company after only 3 months of employment, with the reasoning that if he worked there long enough and obtained qualifications, he would not be able to quit. Despite being hired as an assistant, he was unable to draw skillfully, and was assigned solely to work odd jobs such as cooking. As a result, Fukumoto quit his job as an assistant after about a year and a half. In 1980, he made his debut with Yoroshiku! Junj≈ç Daish≈ç, published in Monthly Sh≈çnen Champion. Since then, his work had not achieved large-scale success for a while, so he worked part-time at places like champon restaurants to earn a living while submitting his entries to Tetsuya Chiba Awards in the meantime. In 1983, his work Wani no Hatsukoi won the Outstanding Newcomer Award at the Tetsuya Chiba Awards. Despite having a good part-time job and earning a good amount of money, he chose to make do with manga alone, and quit at 24 years old. One of the pseudonyms he used at the time was . During his debut, he mainly drew human drama stories, but in the 1980s, the Japanese economy was booming and gambling-themed manga was thriving, so he began drawing gambling manga because it was easier to get work in that field. At the end of the 1980s, his mahjong gambling manga Ten began serialization in Kindai Mahjong Gold. It became Fukumoto's first popular work and established him as a well- known manga artist. In 1996, Fukumoto began serializing Kaiji in Weekly Young Magazine. The series has become a hit, publishing over 70 volumes and selling over 20 million copies, sealing his popularity as a manga artist. Fukumoto donated 30 million yen to the areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011, and has contributed a supportive illustration. He has also visited the affected areas to sign and draw illustrations for the victims. In recent years, he has been involved in making cameo appearances in live-action adaptations of his work, and writing screenplays for the second and third Kaiji films. Style Fukumoto is known as one of the leading gambling manga authors, and his work is defined by detailed psychological descriptions and intense characterizations. Much of his works depict men in extreme games, which range from modifications of existing games to original ones altogether. The number of female characters in his gambling-focused works is extremely low, although they do appear quite commonly in works that mainly deal with human nature. Later, however, he began Yami-Mahjong Fighter: Mamiya, a gambling-focused series with a female protagonist. When drawing, he has a unique penning method of spinning the manuscript paper as he draws. In July 2009, he appeared at the \\"Big Comic Superior Presents: The 6th \\"Rieko Saibara's Life Drawing Skill Showdown\\"\\" event held at Loft Plus One in Shinjuku, Tokyo, where he drew an illustration of Kaiji in his unique way in front of a large audience and astounded other performers such as Saibara and Hisashi Eguchi. His favorite gambling activities include mahjong and sic bo, among others. His least favorite is horse racing. He has been playing mahjong since junior high school days, and admitted that though he has rarely lost a game when he was in school, his current level of ability is average. According to him, he has \\"tournament luck\\" and has even won mahjong tournaments between mahjong manga artists. He has also participated in professional mahjong matches. He played about two games against Akagi and Kaiji's voice actor Masato Hagiwara, who is known as one of the best mahjong players in the entertainment industry, and made Hagiwara say \\"I don't think I can beat him.\\" Works  * (1977) - Maiden work * (1980, Monthly Sh≈çnen Champion) \\\\- Debut * (1980, Monthly Sh≈çnen Champion) * (1980, Monthly Sh≈çnen Champion) - First serial story * (1982) * (1983, Morning) * (1986, Manga Action) * (1986-1995, Kindai Mahjong Original) * (1987-1988, Tokusen Mahjong) * (1989‚Äì2002, Kindai Mahjong Gold) * (1990, Gekiga Mahjong Jidai) * (1990, Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine) * (1990‚Äì1991, Keiba Gold) * (1991‚Äì2018, Kindai Mahjong) * (1992‚Äì1996, Action Pizazz) * (1996, Weekly Manga Sunday) * (1996‚Äì1999, Weekly Young Magazine)  (2000‚Äì2004, Weekly Young Magazine)  (2004‚Äì2007, Weekly Young Magazine)  (2009‚Äì2012, Weekly Young Magazine)  (2013‚Äì2017, Weekly Young Magazine)  (2017‚Äìpresent, Weekly Young Magazine) * (1999, Pachinko Jidai) * (2000-2001, Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine) * (2002‚Äì2006, Big Comic Original)  (2013‚Äì2020, Big Comic Original) * (2007‚Äì2009, Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine)  (2011‚Äì2013, Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine) * (2019‚Äìpresent, Kindai Mahjong) =As writer= * (1999, Young Magazine Uppers) - Illustrated by Kaiji Kawaguchi * (2001, Young Magazine Uppers) - Illustrated by Kaiji Kawaguchi * (2011, theatrical film) - Screenplay * (2020, theatrical film) - Original story, screenplay =As supervisor= * (2008‚Äì2012, Kindai Mahjong Original) - Written by Keiichir≈ç Hara, spin-off of Akagi  (2012‚Äì2014, Kindai Mahjong Original ‚Üí Kindai Manga) - Written by Keiichir≈ç Hara * (2009‚Äìpresent, Kindai Mahjong) - Written by Jir≈ç Maeda, spin-off of Ten * (2015‚Äì2020, Monthly Young Magazine ‚Üí Comic Days) - Written by Tensei Hagiwara, illustrated by Tomohiro Hashimoto and Tomoki Miyoshi, spin-off of Kaiji * (2017‚Äìpresent, Weekly Young Magazine) - Written by Tensei Hagiwara, illustrated by Motomu Uehara and Kazuya Arai * (2017‚Äì2018, Yawaraka Spirits) - Written by Kenji Yokoi, illustrated by Motomu Uehara and Kazuya Arai, spin-off of The Legend of the Strongest, Kurosawa! =TV/Movie appearances= * (2009, theatrical film) * (2011, theatrical film) * (2017, TV Tokyo) - Episodes 9, 10 * (2017, SKY PerfecTV!) - Episode 2 * (2018, Nippon Television) - Episode 7 * (2018, TV Tokyo) - Episode 5 * (2020, theatrical film) =Miscellaneous= * (2011, Takeshobo) * (2014, Government Public Relations Online) * (2015) - End card (ep 4) * (2017) - End card (ep 9)  References  External links  * Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Manga artists Category:Manga artists from Kanagawa Prefecture Category:People from Yokosuka, Kanagawa Category:Winner of Kodansha Manga Award (General) ","title":"Nobuyuki Fukumoto"},{"id":"3941587","text":"Charles Wedge (1746‚Äì1842), English farmer and surveyor, was the son of Sir Francis Wedge of Aqualate Park at Forton, Staffordshire, and the brother of John Wedge and Thomas Wedge.

TRACS, which is based in Forest, Virginia, is recognized by the United States Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Despite the transnational in its name, almost all of the schools the organization reviews are located in the United States. History The organization was founded in 1979. According to the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), TRACS is a \\"product of the ICR\\". TRACS requires all accredited schools to have a statement of faith that affirms \\"the inerrancy and historicity of the Bible\\" and \\"the divine work of non-evolutionary creation including persons in God's image\\". page 80 also see: \\"Biblical Creation. Special creation of the existing space-time universe and all its basic systems and kinds of organisms in the six literal days of the creation week.\\" on page 81 TRACS's first application for federal recognition in 1987 was denied, but in 1991 under President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Education Secretary Lamar Alexander \\"approved TRACS, despite his advisory panel's repeatedly recommending against recognition.\\" Approval came following TRACS' third rejection by the board in which Secretary Alexander \\"arranged for an appeal hearing,\\" and critics of the approval said the move was about politics. TRACS' approval \\"worried\\" accrediting officials who concluded that TRACS was not a qualified accreditor and the move was criticized by education officials. Another source of criticism was the 1991 granting of accreditation to the Institute for Creation Research. One of TRACS' board members was Henry M. Morris, founder of ICR. Attorney Timothy Sandefur called Morris's position on the board \\"highly questionable\\". In 2007 John D. Morris, Henry Morris' son, asked TRACS to terminate the ICR's accreditation. The reason was, in part, that the ICR moved to Texas and the state did not recognize TRACS. In 1993, Steve Levicoff published a book-length critical discussion of TRACS, When the TRACS Stop Short: An Evaluation and Critique of the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools.Steve Levicoff, When the TRACS stop short : an evaluation and critique of the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (Ambler, PA: Institute on Religion and Law, 1993). Levicoff criticized TRACS's expedited accreditation of Liberty University and its creation of a category for schools which it called associate schools. While this category \\"was not considered an official accreditation,\\" Levicoff argued that TRACS lent its name to a number of \\"blatantly fraudulent institutions.\\", Timothy Sandefur, Nexus law journal, Chapman University School of Law, March 24, 2002 Liberty gained TRACS accreditation in September 1984, but resigned its accreditation on November 6, 2008. In 1995, a federal review was conducted and National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity placed TRACS on 18 months probation. Critics argued that TRACS should have never had approval and the reason for the initial rejections \\"wasn't over doctrine, but whether they were in the process of accrediting schools which truly gave degrees in line with other similar degrees.\\" One reason for the probation was TRACS starting the accrediting process for schools that could not meet basic requirements, such as Nashville Bible College, which was granted \\"accreditation candidate status\\" when it had twelve full-time students, seven part-time students, and two part-time faculty members. Improvements were made, including eliminating the \\"associate schools\\" category and changing chairmen.

It was a conversion of Airspeed Oxford military trainers surplus after the Second World War. Development The civil AS.6 Airspeed Envoy eight seat airliner of 1934 was militarised in 1937 to create the mass-produced AS.10 Airspeed Oxford trainer. The Oxford was used by several air forces for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, and 8,586 were produced.Stroud Aeroplane Monthly July 1995, p. 67.Middleton Aeroplane Monthly June 1980, pp. 323‚Äì324. From 1946, 162 Oxfords were refurbished and adapted for civilian use as the Consul at Portsmouth, as war surplus Oxfords were common and inexpensive. They were superficially attractive as a small twin-engine airliner, and Airspeed soon offered a conversion kit. Airspeed Consul of Aer Lingus at Liverpool in 1949 The Consul saw service with small scheduled and charter airlines as feeder liners in Great Britain, and also Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, East Africa and Canada, and was the first type operated by Malayan Airways, the predecessor of Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines. Some Consuls were operated as executive transports by large industrial companies. However, their wooden construction, heavy wartime use, somewhat tricky handling and small capacity (six seats) told against them. Many of the 'civil' conversions were bought by military users; and the Consul served as a VIP transport with the air forces of Britain, Canada and New Zealand, all of whom already operated Oxfords.

Location & Access  Ayamkudy is located at 9¬∞45'N & 76¬∞28'E. It nestled in rubber plantations and surrendered by paddy fields and coconut lagoons. It is on the Kerala backwaters. Ayamkudy is only slightly off from the road linking Kottayam and Ernakulam. Public buses are the best way to access Ayamkudy. There are few dozen buses plying between Kottayam and Vaikom, many of which have stops in Ayamkudy. Alternatively, one can hire a taxi/auto rickshaw from the nearby town of Kaduthuruthy, which is well connected to other cities and towns in the state. Kottayam and Ernakulam are the nearest major railroad stations; Cochin International Airport (IATA: COK) is the nearest airport. Demographics Ayamkudy is rather densely populated. Ayamkudians are divided roughly equally between Hindus and Christians. Ezhava, Pulayar, Nair, Ashari, Namboothiris are the most common Hindu castes.  Institutions in Ayamkudy  Ayamkudy has three educational institutions: a Lower primary school, a High school and an English Medium school. It has a public library and a post office. There is a famous Lord Shiva temple (Thiruvayamkudy Mahadeva Kshetram), and also a Devi temple in the village. There are three Catholic churches: Malappuram St. Theresa Church, Maduravelli Infant Jesus Church, and Alphansapuram Church.  History of the temple  The history of the temple or its origin could be dated back as early as 1000 AD. The main idol is a Shivalingam, supposed to have appeared on its own in the homagni (sacred fire) in a Brahmin's house at Ayamkudy. This Brahmin (Namboothiri) was an ardent devotee of Vaikathappan (Lord Shiva), the main deity of the famous temple at Vaikom away. According to legend, he was unable to get to the temple for worship due to his old age, so the deity of that temple (Vaikathappan) appeared in his Upasana Homagni. The temple was constructed later and it stands presently as the top center of the village. There seem to have been seven Ooranma families (owners) of the temple; however, only five still have living members. The present Ooranma Families include Pattamana Illam, Ettikkada Mana, Irishi Illam, Marangatta Mana and Neithasseri Mana. The temple houses a Rahasya Ara (secret cabin) where the divine power is located. This is considered a reservoir for the power of the idol. The cabin is well protected with granite stones. A lamp is lighted every day in front of it, before the other main lamps are lighted. A serpent is believed to be sitting in front of this to safeguard the place. There is also a water well, with a perennial spring of cool water. This believed to have a connection with the Ganges, originating from the divine head of Lord Shiva. Although the well is situated in the uppermost part of the village, its water has never gone below a certain level, even when most of the wells in the village have dried up. The Ayamkudy village has been a center for learning Rig Veda, with many experts resident in the village. Education in the Rig Veda takes nearly seven years; the coaching was always associated with the temple. Until recently, the temple has also been known for its assets in the form of land. However, the situation has dramatically changed in the recent past.  Festival  The festival in the temple is associated with Mahasivaraathri. It comes in the Malayalam month of Kumbha. The festival starts with Kodiyettu. The six-day festival ends with the Aaraattu (Holy Bath), which is conducted on the Amaavasi day (new moon) in this month. This usually falls on the very next day of Mahasivaraathri. The main functions associated with the festival are Kalabhabhishekam, Kodiyettu, Uthsavabali, Sreebhoothabali, Mulapooja, Sivaraathri Pooja, Pallivetta, Vilakkezhunnelipu, and Aarattu. Also festival in St. Thersa's church in October is famous, a lot of people irrespective of religion are coming to church on that day & ReferencesExternal links *Website of Ayamkudy NEWS Category:Villages in Kottayam district ","title":"Ayamkudy"},{"id":"3941647","text":"Form W-9, 2011 Form W-9 (officially, the \\"Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification\\") is used in the United States income tax system by a third party who must file an information return with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Internal Revenue Code ¬ß 31.3406(h)-3 It requests the name, address, and taxpayer identification information of a taxpayer (in the form of a Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number). The form is never actually sent to the IRS, but is maintained by the individual who files the information return for verification purposes. The information on the Form W-9 and the payment made are reported on a Form 1099.Internal Revenue Code ¬ß 1.6041-1 Use cases=Business‚Äìcontractor arrangement= Form W-9 is most commonly used in a business‚Äìcontractor arrangement. Businesses can use Form W-9 to request information from contractors they hire. When a business pays a contractor in excess of $600 during a tax year, the business is required to file Form 1099-MISC, a variant of Form 1099. To fill out Form 1099-MISC, the business may need to request information (such as address and Tax Identification Number) from the contractor, for which Form W-9 is used. The business does not send Form W-9 to the IRS. =Avoiding backup withholding= Another purpose of Form W-9 is to help the payee avoid backup withholding. The payer must collect withholding taxes on certain reportable payments for the IRS. However, if the payee certifies on the W-9 they are not subject to backup withholding they generally receive the full payment due them from the payer. This is similar to the withholding exemptions certifications found on Form W-4 for employees. =Financial institution‚Äìcustomer arrangement= Financial institutions sometimes send Form W-9 to a customer to request information. However, it is not necessarily required for the customer to fill out the form if the institution already has the requested information from when the customer opened an account. =Employer‚Äìemployee arrangement= In an employer‚Äìemployee arrangement, Form W-9 and Form 1099 should not be used. Instead, the corresponding Form W-4 (to provide information) and Form W-2 (to report amount paid) should be filed instead. However an employer may still send Form W-9 to have the information on record that the payee doesn't need to be sent Form 1099. Filing method Form W-9 can be completed on paper or electronically. For electronic filing, there are several requirements. Namely, a requester who establishes an electronic filing system must ensure that the electronic system provides the same information as on a paper Form W-9, that a hard copy can be supplied to the IRS on demand, that \\"the information received is the information sent and [‚Ä¶] all occasions of user access that result in the submission [are documented]\\", that the person accessing the system and providing the information is the individual identified on the form, and that an electronic signature is used. Deadline Some certified public accountants consider it best practice to ensure the completion of Form W-9 by payees before issuing any payments. There may also be a $50 penalty for each instance in which Form W-9 is not filled out.

He died after being speared by Aboriginals in 1844. Early years Darke was born in Hereford, England, in 1806, the son of William Darke, a prosperous owner of property in Hereford, and Elizabeth Darke. Practically nothing is known of his early years in England. He arrived in Van Diemen's Land in 1824, accompanied by two of his uncles: Edward Davey Wedge and John Helder Wedge who became the Second Assistant Surveyor in the Land Survey Department. During 1824‚Äì25, Darke spent time with his Uncle John learning the profession of surveying as they moved around the state. In January 1826, Darke joined Lieutenant Williams of the 40th Regiment in pursuit and capture of the bushranger, Thomas Jeffries, and in consequence was granted 500 acres of land. In early March he again joined Lieutenant Williams, this time in search of Matthew Brady and his gang. Brady was wounded in the leg, but escaped. He was captured later in the month by John Batman and his party. Surveyor-explorer In 1832 the Land Survey Department, under Surveyor-General George Frankland, began preparing for a trigonometric survey of the island, and Darke was successful in obtaining a temporary position within the department. One area of particular interest to Frankland was the area west of Wylds Craig (then known as the Peak of Teneriffe). An escaped convict from Sarah Island, James Goodwin, has passed through the area on his way back to the settled districts. With five men, Darke was sent to explore the region west of Wylds Craig beginning on 19 March 1833. One of the men was James Goodwin: \\"an excellent hand in the bush who had formerly escaped from Macquarie Harbour\\".Gowlland, p14 The expedition came to an end on 8 April due to hunger and fatigue, without achieving its survey aims. Darke began a second expedition to Wylds Craig in May 1833 which also ended without success when Darke suffered severe burns to his right foot. He was unable to obtain permanent employment as a surveyor and left Van Diemen's Land for the Port Phillip District in February 1836 where he took up land near Geelong. Darke was recruited as a surveyor in South Australia 1838. He wrote a letter of resignation in November 1839 (probably due to his romantic attachment to a Miss Elizabeth Carter), and was sacked on 31 December 1839 for being absent from duty.Gowlland, p37-38 In 1840 Darke married Elizabeth Isabella Carter, sister-in-law to South Australia police inspector Alexander Tolmer. In 1844 Darke was named as the leader of a privately funded expedition to explore the country west and north-west of Port Lincoln and Spencer Gulf. On 12 April, he and three other men left Adelaide on the Governor Gawler and sailed for Port Lincoln. The party left Port Lincoln on 29 August to begin their exploration. Led by Darke, the party comprised Darke's friend and second in command, surveyor John Henry Theakston (d.1878), plus two men hired as tent-keepers and cooks. One was named James Howard, the other is unidentified. They travelled though an ocean of scrub to beyond the Gawler Ranges, Darke having found no land suitable for settling. The party began their retreat from this waterless area on 16 October. Final diary entry Darke's final diary entry was on 22 October: \\"Accompanied by the [three] blacks who were joined by nine others, I proceeded to the waterhole, about three miles, but more easterly than our course; and came about 2 o'clock to a large gritstone rock where I found abundance of feed and water on a plain about 200 yards wide by half a mile long, surrounded by thick scrub. The natives accompanied us until just before encamping. I gave them all I could spare for taking us to the water. They seemed very friendly disposed...\\"Gowland, p50 The diary continues in the hand of Darke's second-in-command, John Theakston, and describes how Darke was speared in the stomach and knee by three natives. His death is recorded by Theakston: \\"I here dressed the wounds of Mr Darke, and bled him, but found his extremities getting cold, and I informed him. I feared the event. At 10 o'clock he told me he was dying, that mortification had taken place, he was out of pain; he gave me his last commands and died at five minutes to twelve, quite calm to the last minute. I carried the body of Mr Darke to the Table Topped Peaks and buried him on a small grassy plain at the foot of them, in a grave five feet deep.\\"Gowland, p51For a description of the aboriginal version of events, see p54, Gowland Position of grave Grave of John Charles Darke, c. 1925 In a letter to The Adelaide Observer in 1891, a Mr A.J. Foulds stated: \\"In a hollow on the north-west of the most northern peak or hump (which is the highest, and is in fact Darkes Peak) the grave is situated, and there the bold explorer lies, with all the country about to himself, for very rarely indeed does the feet of man ‚Äì white or black ‚Äì ever tread in that lonely desert.\\"Gowland, p55 In 1909, Surveyor W.G. Evans located Darke's grave and confirmed the finding by partly opening the grave: \\"found part of a shin bone (decayed), hip bone ‚Äì good preservation, but crumbled when exposed to air‚Ä¶ did not disturb grave more than necessary, mounded up afterwards.\\"Gowland, p57 The government of South Australia created a reserve around the grave site in 1910 and erected an obelisk surrounded by an iron fence. Legacy Darke's name is perpetuated by Darke Peak, a mountain in the Darke Ranges located in the centre of Eyre Peninsula in the locality of Darke Peak. Two memorials in addition to the obelisk at the grave site commemorate the life of Darke. On the centenary of Darke's departure from Adelaide on his final expedition, a bronze tablet was fixed to the wall of a building in King William Street, Adelaide, near the spot where the expedition departed. In a similar tribute, a plaque was unveiled on 29 August 1944 in the Civic Hall at Port Lincoln. John Theakston went on to serve as second in command to the expedition of the ill-fated John Ainsworth Horrocks, where again through the leader's misfortune he was obliged to assume command. Darke's widow, Elizabeth, remarried at Sydney in 1858 to prominent physician and author Dr Julius Berncastle MD MRCS (1819‚Äì1870).https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Julius_Berncastle The couple and their family later moved to Melbourne, where Dr Berncastle died in 1870 and Elizabeth in 1881.

PBA occurs secondary to a neurologic disorder or brain injury. Patients may find themselves crying uncontrollably at something that is only moderately sad, being unable to stop themselves for several minutes. Episodes may also be mood-incongruent: a patient may laugh uncontrollably when angry or frustrated, for example. Sometimes, the episodes may switch between emotional states, resulting in the patient crying uncontrollably before dissolving into fits of laughter. The pseudobulbar affect, also referred to as emotional lability, should not be confused with labile mood or labile emotions that stem from emotional instability ‚Äì affective dysregulation ‚Äì commonly seen in personality disorders. Signs and symptoms The cardinal feature of the disorder is a pathologically lowered threshold for exhibiting the behavioral response of laughter, crying, anger or all of the above. An affected individual exhibits episodes of laughter, crying, anger or a combination of these without an apparent motivating stimulus or in response to stimuli that would not have elicited such an emotional response before the onset of their underlying neurologic disorder. In some patients, the emotional response is exaggerated in intensity but is provoked by a stimulus with an emotional valence congruent with the character of the emotional display. For example, a sad stimulus provokes a pathologically exaggerated weeping response instead of a sigh, which the patient normally would have exhibited in that particular instance. However, in some other patients, the character of the emotional display can be incongruent with, and even contradictory to, the emotional valence of the provoking stimulus or may be incited by a stimulus with no clear valence. For example, a patient may laugh in response to sad news or cry in response to stimuli with no emotional undertone, or, once provoked, the episodes may switch from laughing to crying or vice versa. The symptoms of PBA can be severe, with persistent and unremitting episodes. Characteristics include: * The onset can be sudden and unpredictable, and has been described by some patients as coming on like a seizure; * The outbursts have a typical duration of a few seconds to several minutes; and, * The outbursts may happen several times a day. Many people with neurologic disorders exhibit uncontrollable episodes of laughing, crying, or anger that are either exaggerated or contradictory to the context in which they occur. Where patients have significant cognitive deficits (e.g., Alzheimer's) it can be unclear whether it is true PBA as opposed to a grosser form of emotional dysregulation, but patients with intact cognition often report the symptom as disturbing. Patients report that their episodes are at best only partially amenable to voluntary control, and unless they experience a severe change of mental status, as in Traumatic Brain Injury they often have insight into their problem and judge their emotional displays as inappropriate and out of character. The clinical effect of PBA can be severe, with unremitting and persistent symptoms that can be disabling to patients, and may significantly affect quality of life for caregivers. =Social impact= While not as profoundly disabling as the physical symptoms of these diseases, PBA may significantly influence individuals' social functioning and their relationships with others. Such sudden, frequent, extreme, uncontrollable emotional outbursts may lead to social withdrawal and interfere with activities of daily living, social and professional pursuits, and reduce overall healthcare. For example, patients with ALS and MS are often cognitively normal. However, the appearance of uncontrollable emotions is commonly associated with many additional neurological disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, and migraines. This may lead to avoidance of social interactions for the patient, which in turn impairs their coping mechanisms and their careers. Several criteria exist to differentiate between PBA and depression. =Depression= PBA may often be misdiagnosed as clinical depression or bipolar disorder; however, many clear distinctions exist. In depressive and bipolar disorders, crying, anger or laughter are typically a indicative of mood, whereas the pathological displays of crying which occur in PBA are often in contrast to the underlying mood, or greatly in excess of the mood or eliciting stimulus. In addition, a key to differentiating depression from PBA is duration: PBA episodes are sudden, occurring in an episodic manner, while crying in depression is a more sustained presentation and closely relates to the underlying mood state. The level of control that one has over the crying, anger or other emotional displays in PBA is minimal or nonexistent, whereas for those suffering from depression, the emotional expression (typically crying) can be modulated by the situation. Similarly, the trigger for episodes of crying in patients with PBA may be nonspecific, minimal or inappropriate to the situation, but in depression the stimulus is specific to the mood-related condition. These differences are outlined in the adjacent Table. In some cases, depressed mood and PBA may co-exist. Since depression is one of the most common emotional changes in patients with neurodegenerative disease or post-stroke sequelae, it is often comorbid with PBA. Comorbidity implies that depression is distinct from PBA and is not necessary for, nor does it exclude, a diagnosis of PBA. Causes The specific pathophysiology involved in this frequently debilitating condition is still under investigation; the primary pathogenic mechanisms of PBA remain controversial. One hypothesis, established by early researchers such as Wilson and Oppenheim, placed emphasis on the role of the corticobulbar pathways in modulating emotional expression in a top-down model, and theorized that PBA occurs when bilateral lesions in the descending corticobulbar tract cause failure of voluntary control of emotion, which leads to the disinhibition, or release, of laughing/crying centers in the brainstem. Other theories implicate the prefrontal cortex. =Secondary condition= PBA is a condition that occurs secondary to neurological disease or brain injury, and is thought to result from disruptions of neural networks that control the generation and regulation of motor output of emotions. PBA is most commonly observed in people with neurologic injuries such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke, and neurologic diseases such as dementias including Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), PANDAS in children and adults, and Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported as a symptom of hyperthyroidism, Graves' Disease, or hypothyroidism in combination with depression. PBA has also been observed in association with a variety of other brain disorders, including brain tumors, Wilson's disease, syphilitic pseudobulbar palsy, and various encephalitides. Rarer conditions associated with PBA include gelastic epilepsy, dacrystic epilepsy, central pontine myelinolysis, olivopontinocerebellar atrophy, lipid storage diseases, chemical exposure (e.g., nitrous oxide and insecticides), fou rire prodromique, and Angelman syndrome. It is hypothesized that these primary neurologic injuries and diseases affect chemical signaling in the brain, which in turn disrupts the neurologic pathways that control emotional expression. =Stroke= PBA is one of the most frequently reported post-stroke behavioral syndromes, with a range of reported prevalence rates from 28% to 52%. The higher prevalence rates tend to be reported in stroke patients who are older or who have a history of prior stroke. The relationship between post-stroke depression and PBA is complicated, because the depressive syndrome also occurs with high frequency in stroke survivors. Post-stroke patients with PBA are more depressed than post-stroke patients without PBA, and the presence of a depressive syndrome may exacerbate the weeping side of PBA symptoms. =Multiple sclerosis= Recent studies suggest that approximately 10% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will experience at least one episode of emotional lability. PBA is generally associated with later stages of the disease (chronic progressive phase). PBA in MS patients is associated with more severe intellectual deterioration, physical disability, and neurological disability. =Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis= A study designed specifically to survey for prevalence found that 49% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also had PBA. PBA does not appear to be associated with duration of ALS. It is a symptom of ALS that many patients are unaware of and do not receive information about from their physician. =Traumatic brain injury= One study of 301 consecutive cases in a clinic setting reported a 5% prevalence. PBA occurred in patients with more severe head injury, and coincided with other neurological features suggestive of pseudobulbar palsy. The Brain Injury Association of America (BIAA) indicates that approximately 80% of survey respondents experience symptoms of PBA. Results from a recent investigation estimate the prevalence of PBA associated with traumatic brain injury to exceed more than 55% of survivors. Treatment Education of patients, families, and caregivers is an important component of the appropriate treatment of PBA. Crying associated with PBA may be incorrectly interpreted as depression; laughter may be embarrassing, anger can be debilitating. It is therefore critical for families and caregivers to recognize the pathological nature of PBA and the reassurance that this is an involuntary syndrome that is manageable. Traditionally, antidepressants such as sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, nortriptyline and amitriptyline have been prescribed with some efficacy. =Medication = Dextromethorphan hydrobromide affects the signals in the brain that trigger the cough reflex. It is used as a cough suppressant, although it can sometimes be used, medicinally, as a pain reliever, and is also used as a recreational drug. Quinidine sulfate affects the way the heart beats, and is generally used in people with certain heart rhythm disorders. It is also used to treat malaria. Quinidine sulfate, as a metabolic inhibitor, \\"increases plasma levels of dextromethorphan by competitively inhibiting cytochrome P450 2D6, which catalyzes a major biotransformation pathway for dextromethorphan,\\" enabling therapeutic dextromethorphan concentrations. Dextromethorphan/quinidine is a combination of these two generic drugs, and is the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of PBA, approved on October 29, 2010. For this multicenter study, the \\"Objectives...[were] to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of two different doses of AVP-923 [Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination]...when compared to placebo.\\" The conditions and results of that study are as follows: Epidemiology Prevalence estimates place the number of people with PBA between 1.5 and 2 million in the United States alone, which would be less than 1% of the U.S. population even at the high end of the estimate. Some argue that the number is probably higher and that clinicians underdiagnose PBA. However, the prevalence estimate of 2 million is based on an online survey. Self-selected computer-savvy patients in at-risk groups evaluated their own symptoms and submitted their self-diagnoses. No doctor or clinic confirmed the data. Motivation to participate could have been influenced by the presence of symptoms, which would have skewed the results. The actual prevalence could very well be quite a bit lower than estimated. History The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals by Charles Darwin was published in 1872. In Chapter VI, \\"Special Expressions of Man: Suffering and Weeping\\", Darwin discusses cultural variations in the acceptability of weeping and the wide differences in individual responses to suffering. The chapter contains the following sentence: > We must not, however, lay too much stress on the copious shedding of tears > by the insane, as being due to the lack of all restraint; for certain brain- > diseases, as hemiplegia, brain-wasting, and senile decay, have a special > tendency to induce weeping.p. 156 Terminology Historically, there have been a variety of terms used for the disorder, including pseudobulbar affect, pathological laughter and crying, emotional lability, emotionalism, emotional dysregulation, or more recently, involuntary emotional expression disorder. The term pseudobulbar (pseudo- + bulbar) came from the idea that the symptoms seemed similar to those caused by a bulbar lesion (that is, a lesion in the medulla oblongata). Terms such as forced crying, involuntary crying, pathological emotionality, and emotional incontinence have also been used, although less frequently. In popular culture Signs of pseudobulbar affect were featured as affecting the title character of the 2019 film Joker, and are said to be what Joaquin Phoenix used as inspiration for his character's titular laugh. In the 2019 movie Parasite, the character named Ki-woo suffers a head trauma, and although it is not clearly mentioned that he's affected by pseudobulbar affect, he mentions not being able to stop laughing when thinking about all the events that occur in the movie. In the medical television show House, season 7, episode 8 (Small Sacrifices), the character Ramon Silva, played by Kuno Becker displays pseudobulbar affect, with uncontrollable incongruent laughter, while suffering from Marburg variety of Multiple sclerosis.

Design and development The Model 626 was developed by Avro from the company's Model 621 (Tutor) for export to smaller air forces, the idea being that the 626 would be a single aircraft that could carry out general aircrew training as well as a number of other roles. The types 621 and 626 were both two-seaters, but the latter had an additional cockpit behind the rear seat of the 621 and accessible from it. This additional cockpit was fitted with a Scarff ring for a machine gun and carried equipment for air navigation, wireless and gunnery training. Structurally and aerodynamically, it was almost identical to the Tutor: it had a conventional fabric-covered, metal airframe with single-bay wings. Most of the 626s, like the Tutors had an Armstrong Siddeley Lynx IVC engine of 240 hp (180 kW), but most of those supplied to the Egyptian and Brazilian Air Forces used a 260 hp (190 kW) Cheetah V from the same maker. The usual undercarriage used split, fixed mainwheels and either a tailskid or later a tailwheel, but some 621s appeared on floats and on skis. The prototype was first flown in 1930. Operational history Avro employed an aggressive sales and marketing effort to introduce the Model 626 to customers throughout the world. An early production demonstration aircraft, marked G-ABFM Jackson 1990, p. 295. was sent by sea to South America in 1931. After demonstrations in Buenos Aires and a record-setting flight over the Andes, the aircraft was commandeered by Argentine military officials to help quell a local uprising. The 626 performed so well that an order was immediately placed for 14 additional aircraft. The biggest users were the Air Forces of Chile, Greece, and Portugal. Numerous sales were made to foreign air forces up to 1939, some of which survived in second-line service until 1945. The 621 was not a civil type, though some did briefly appear on the civil registers of the UK (15) and Hong Kong (6).\\"VR-H.\\" goldenyears.ukf.net. Retrieved: 8 August 2011. These markings were worn for testing, demonstration and export; only two civil machines stayed on the prewar U.K.register. After the war, two R.A.F. Prefects were civilianised, as was one in New Zealand. Variants * Avro 626: Two seat multi-purpose aircraft * Avro Prefect : RAF and RNZAF name for the 626; in the period most RAF aircraft received names.Jackson 1990, p. 296-297. Quote: \\"During their service life these machines were known simply as Avro Prefects without type number, to distinguish them from the Avro 626\\" All RNZAF Prefects had three cockpits. All the RAF machines were two-seat navigational training aircraft without the third cockpit installed.Jackson 1990, p. 296. * Avro 637 : Armed patrol version of the Avro 626. Pilot had a .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun mounted on the fuselage while the observer/gunner was armed with a .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun on an Avro low-drag mounting. This variant featured a slightly larger wingspan with rounded wingtips.

He has worked with some of Latin music's most popular artists starting with Marc Anthony, DLG, Jennifer Lopez, Tito Nieves, V√≠ctor Manuelle, Frankie Negr√≥n, Johnny Rivera, Ray Sep√∫lveda, Tito Puente, Thalia, Orquesta de la Luz, Ivy Queen, Celia Cruz, La India, Jerry Rivera, Bacilos, Leslie Grace, Toby Love, Cheo Feliciano, Prince Royce, Liz Elias, Indy Flow, among others. Biography George, the son of Puerto Rican parents, was born and raised in New York City, and attended the City College of New York. He had started his professional career with Conjunto Cach√© and Conjunto Cl√°sico in 1979, then moved on to session recordings and live performances during the 1980s. Starting in 1987, George was musical director for several album recordings, including being pianist for Grupo Star for their 1987 album \\"Grupo Star\\", and lived in Colombia for a year. During this period he was also a member of Grupo Baruc and their release of the album \\"Reeencuentro\\" in 1988. It was not until he became the producer of Tito Nieves's first album \\"The Classic\\" for RMM in 1988 that his status as one of the most sought-after salsa producers was stamped. Also in 1988, he was the producer and musical director for Johnny & Ray's (later became Johnny Ray) first album \\"Mascarada\\" with vocalist Ray Sepulveda. George later became the main visionary behind the New York-based Latin label RMM Records & Video, between 1988 and 1995, arranging, producing, and directing dozens of recordings for that label, working with artists like Jose Alberto 'El Canario', Johnny Rivera, Domingo Quinones, Tony Vega, Ray Sepulveda, Cheo Feliciano, Celia Cruz, La India and others. He produced the 1991 album \\"100th LP\\" for Tito Puente, produced & arranged the first two albums of Marc Anthony, \\"Otra Nota\\" & \\"Todo A Su Tiempo\\". George also produced the platinum-selling \\"Combinacion Perfecta\\" album from Familia RMM in 1993. He also produced and sessioned in recordings outside of RMM during this period, including albums with Nestor Sanchez, Junior Gonzalez, Africando and Los Hermanos Colon, as well as arranging several hit songs, including his arrangement on the hit track \\"Solo\\" for Luis Enrique on his 1989 album \\"Mi Mundo\\". In early 1995, George left RMM to pursue his own producing venture with Sir George Entertainment, and had a producing agreement with Sony Discos. During this time, he formed DLG, featuring vocalist Huey Dunbar and rappers James 'Da Barba' and Fragancia. He also helped in re-inventing Victor Manuelle into one of the Salsa's most powerful artists. His producing credits continued on with WEA Latina by 1997 with Frankie Negron, Charlie Cruz, Charlie Cardona, Servando Y Florentino and many other salsa performers. In early 2004, Sergio George and Latin recording executive George Zamora created SGZ Entertainment, in Miami, Florida, focusing on urban artists. In August 2006, SGZ Entertainment became part of La Calle Records, a sublabel of Univision. During the 2008 Latin Grammy Awards, Sergio George won Producer of the Year for his work on \\"Historia De Taxi\\" by Ricardo Arjona featuring Marc Anthony, \\"La Vida Se Va\\" by Gloria Trevi, \\"Mi Mayor Sacrificio\\" by Tito Nieves featuring Marco Antonio Sol√≠s, \\"Quiero Decirte Que Te Amo\\" by DLG featuring Ness, \\"Toro Mata\\" by DLG featuring Napoles and Ness and the album El Cantante by Marc Anthony. In 2009, George founded Top Stop Music, and the first release was with Luis Enrique and his album, Ciclos which has topped the charts and garnered two Latin Grammy awards. He signed Prince Royce, whose self-titled debut album was released early 2010. At the end of 2009, La India signed with Top Stop Music, having her first single released in early 2010, \\"Estupida\\" which quickly reached number one on the US Billboard Tropical Songs chart. Her album, Unica, was released by Top Stop Music in 2010. At the 11th Latin Grammy Awards, George received his second Latin Grammy for Producer of the Year, for his work on \\"Coraz√≥n Sin Cara\\", \\"Tu y Yo\\" and \\"Stand By Me\\" by Prince Royce, \\"Est√∫pida\\", \\"Si √âl Te Habla De Mi\\", \\"Smile\\" and \\"Te Vas a Arrepentir\\" by La India.

He was the younger brother of sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Khan.Farrell, Gerry (2001). \\"Khan, Imrat\\". Grove Music Online. (subscription required for full text). Training and early career Imrat Khan was born in Calcutta on 17 November 1935 into a family of musicians tracing its roots back for several generations, to the court musicians of the Mughal rulers. The training in music traditionally has been passed down from father to son for nearly 400 years. He belongs to Etawah gharana also known as Imdadkhani gharana of classical musicians. Imrat Khan's father was Enayat Khan (1895‚Äì1938), recognised as a leading sitar and surbahar player of his time, as had been his grandfather, Imdad Khan (1848‚Äì1920), before him. Imrat Khan's father died when Imrat was a child, so he was raised by his mother, Bashiran Begum and her father, singer Bande Hassan Khan. In 1944, the family moved with Vilayat Khan, Imrat's older brother, to Bombay where both the brothers learned sitar-playing extensively from their uncle Wahid Khan. In 1952, Vilayat and Imrat moved in together in Calcutta. They performed together for many years. The two brothers were part of the first cultural delegation to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1956. Solo career and legacy From 1961 onwards, Imrat Khan performed and recorded solo, playing both sitar and surbahar. For decades, Imrat Khan recorded extensively on both his instruments. His full performance practice started with a surbahar alap in dhrupad ang (embellished with more romantic touches), followed by a shorter alap on the sitar leading into gat in traditional Imdadkhani style. (Sitar players such as Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Banerjee added bass strings to their sitars to achieve at least some of the surbahar's lower range on a single instrument). Imrat Khan performed in Europe, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, China and Southeast Asia. He also performed at the Cannes Film Festival in 1970. He spent a portion of each year teaching classical Indian music and instructing sitar students at Washington University in Saint Louis. Imrat Khan's music has been featured in films made by noted filmmakers like Satyajit Ray and James Ivory. \\"In 1971, he made musical history as the first Indian musician to play at London's Royal Albert Hall for the first ever all night performance of Indian classical music in the BBC Promenade Concert Series\\"... says the Webster University, Missouri website. Imrat Khan was the senior performer of the Imdadkhani gharana, the school of sitar and surbahar performance named after his grandfather Imdad Khan. Death and legacy Imrat Khan died on 22 November 2018 at age 83 due to a stroke in St. Louis, Missouri, United States where he had been residing for over two decades prior to his death. He had been ill for some time before his death. Imrat Khan had five sons, Nishat Khan (sitar player), Irshad Khan (sitar player), Wajahat Khan (sarod player) and Shafaatullah Khan (tabla player), and Azmat Ali Khan, who were all trained by him, and are all talented musicians themselves. Awards and recognition In 1988, Imrat Khan received a Sangeet Natak Akademi Award from the President of India. In 2017, he was awarded the Padma Shri; however, he refused to accept the award stating \\"It is too little and came little too late\\"; which also sparked a pandemonium among his students and members of the fraternity.Padma Shri too little too late Times of India (newspaper), Published 3 February 2017, Retrieved 14 July 2020 According to Outlook of India, \\"The noted musician was disappointed that the Indian government never recognized his contributions, even as several of his juniors and those who trained under him were presented with Padma awards\\".

Reign  His reign saw further rise of Turkic power even to the point calling both Zhou and Qi emperors as his sons.Book of Zhou, Volume 50 He appointed his nephews Ashina Shetu as Erzhu khagan to east and B√∂r√º khagan to west as lesser khagans. He switched his alliance from Zhou to Qi. Sent a horse as gift in 572 and granted defeated Qi prince Gao Shaoyi asylum. He transferred the former Northern Qi subjects, whether they fled to or were captured to Tujue, to be under Gao Shaoyi's command. However, he still maintained good relationship with Zhou, sending another horse as gift in 574. Around the new year 578, Gao Baoning, sent a petition to Gao Shaoyi, requesting that he take imperial title. Gao Shaoyi therefore declared himself emperor, with military assistance from Tujue. Taspar attacked Zhou repeatedly until spring 579, when he sought peace with Northern Zhou. Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou created the daughter of his uncle Yuwen Zhao (ÂÆáÊñáÊãõ) the Princess Qianjin, offering to give her to Taspar in marriage if khagan would be willing to surrender Gao Shaoyi. Khagan refused. In 580, after Emperor Xuan's death, Yang Jian, the regent for Emperor Xuan's son Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou, nevertheless sent Princess Qianjin to Tujue to marry Tuobo Khan. After the marriage, Yang then sent the official Heruo Yi (Ë≥ÄËã•Ë™º) to Tujue to bribe khagan to give up Gao Shaoyi. Khagan agreed, and as a ruse, he invited Gao Shaoyi to a hunt, but instead had Heruo Yi capture Gao Shaoyi. In fall 580, Gao Shaoyi was delivered to Northern Zhou's capital Chang'an, and he was exiled to modern Sichuan. Taspar died in 581 from illness, leaving throne to his nephew Talopien.  Legacy  Unlike his father and older brothers he embraced Chinese culture, especially Buddhism. He was converted to Buddhism by the Qi monk Huilin, for whom he built a pagoda. Taspar's death marked the beginning of a long decline and subjugation of the G√∂kt√ºrks to China. During his reign there was a veitable flood of Sogdian Manichean refugees from Persia and Buddhist Refugees from Qi and Zhou, both the result of pogroms. These Sogdians devised the G√∂kt√ºrk Runes to write the Turkic language, for translations of the sutras to Turkic, notably the Nirvana Sutra in 575.  Succession  Taspar's death created a dynastic crisis in the khaganate. His Chinese wife Qianjin survived him, but Taspar bequeathed the throne of the Empire to Talopien, the son of his elder brother Muqan Qaghan. His bequest ran contrary to the traditional system of inheritance which demanded the throne to be passed to the son of the eldest brother, in this case Ishbara Qaghan. The council rejected the legality of Taspar's will stating his mother's non-Turkic origin. Thus appointed Amrak as the next khagan. Talopien's faction did not recognize Amrak. This crisis ultimately resulted in the civil war of 581-603, which greatly weakened the state.

It is situated approximately among the towns of Ru≈æomberok, Harmanec, Turƒçianske Teplice and Martin. The Turiec Basin and the Lesser Fatra mountains are situated to the north west of the range and the Low Tatras mountains are in the east. It can be divided into seven parts: ≈†√≠pska Fatra, ≈†ipr√∫≈à, Lysec, H√¥ƒæna Fatra, Rev√∫cke podolie, Zvolen and Braln√° Fatra. The highest mountain is Ostredok at . Other notable summits of the largest H√¥ƒæna Fatra part are Kr√≠≈æna at and Plosk√° at , where the main ridge divides into two. The western Turiec Ridge () includes, for example, Bori≈°ov at , and the eastern Liptov Ridge () includes, for example, Rakytov at . Braln√° Fatra includes Tlst√° at and Ostr√° at summits. The Zvolen massif () connects the Veƒæk√° Fatra Range with the Low Tatra Range. One of the largest ski resorts in Slovakia - Skipark Ru≈æomberok and Donovaly - lies beneath it. There are several other tourist and skiing resorts in the range. A considerable part of the range is made of various Mesozoic rocks. The central part and the main ridge are made up of non-resistant rocks (slates) and the relief is softly modeled (Plosk√°, Ostredok). The southern and south-western part is formed by resistant limestone and dolomite with rocky walls and reefs. The ridges are usually separated by canyon-like valleys. The most important ones are Gader Valley (Gadersk√° dolina) and Blatnica Valley (Blatnick√° dolina). The longest valley is the ƒΩuboch≈àa Valley (ƒΩubochnianska dolina) at 25 km. Numerous karst formations are located in this area and the Harmanec Cave is one of the best known caves in Slovakia. Scenery Nearly 90% of the area is covered by forests ‚Äì beech and beech-fir forests, in some places replaced by spruce plantations and relics of pines. The area of Harmanec is the richest yew-tree site in Europe. The original natural upper borderline of forests was lowered during the Wallachian colonization. There are many extensive upland pastures, where cattle is raised in the summer.Rough Guide to The Czech & Slovak Republics Rob Humphreys, Tim Nollen - 2003 - Page 489 \\"Hiking in the Velka Fatra : To the east of the Turiec valley lie the Velka Fatra, a line of craggy mountain tops surrounded by a sea of uninhabited, undulating forest.

The Apostolic Signatura only hears appeals from these two tribunals (which normally have final and universal [worldwide Church] appellate jurisdiction over their respective areas of competence) if some process was in error or there is an inter-agency conflict, and usually not in regard to the judgment which was made or the merits of the case. The two other Tribunals located there are the Sacred Roman Rota (which is normally the final appellate tribunal of the church for most court cases, especially regarding marriage nullity, decisions of Bishops, and ecclesiastical trials and disciplinary procedures), and the Apostolic Penitentiary (which is normally the church's final appellate tribunal regarding all matters having to do with the forgiveness of sins and the proper celebration of the Sacrament of Reconciliation). Field of competence The Roman Rota is the ordinary appellate tribunal of the Apostolic See.Code of Canon Law, canon 1443Pastor Bonus, 128 The Signatura's competence covers: # complaints of nullity and petitions for total reinstatement against sentences of the Roman Rota; # recourses, in cases concerning the status of persons, when the Roman Rota has denied a new examination of the case; # exceptions of suspicion and other proceedings against judges of the Roman Rota arising from the exercise of their functions; # conflicts of competence between tribunals which are not subject to the same appellate tribunal.Code of Canon Law, canon 1445 ¬ß1 Apart from these judicial matters, the Signatura has competence as an administrative tribunal to deal with controversies over administrative decisions made by or approved by dicasteries of the Roman Curia if it is contended that the decision violated some law, either in the decision-making process or in the procedure used. It can also deal with administrative controversies referred to it by the Pope or those departments, and with conflicts of competence between the departments.Code of Canon Law, canon 1445 ¬ß2 A third field of competence for the Signatura is that of overseeing all the tribunals of the Catholic Church, with power to extend the competence (jurisdiction) of tribunals, to grant dispensations from procedural laws, to establish interdiocesan tribunals, and to discipline canonical advocates.Code of Canon Law, canon 1445 ¬ß3 The Apostolic Signatura is also the final court of cassation in the civil legal system of Vatican City State.Pope Francis reforms Vatican City courts with new law, CatholicNewsAgency.com, accessed 17 March 2019.

According to a 2008 law issued by Pope Benedict XVI, the civil legal system of Vatican City State recognizes canon law as its first source of norms and first principle of interpretation. Pope Francis has stated that principles of canon law are essential to the interpretation and application of the laws of Vatican City State. History In the thirteenth century the Popes made use of \\"referendarii\\" to investigate and prepare the signing - hence the name signatura - of petitions and other cases presented to the Holy See. Pope Eugene IV entrusted these referendaries with authority to sign certain petitions and thereby established a permanent office for this purpose. Under Popes Alexander VI, Sixtus IV and Julius II this office was divided into two, the Signatura gratiae for examining petitions for favours, and the Signatura iustitiae for contentious cases. The honourable office of referendary came to be conferred frequently as a merely honorary title, but Pope Sixtus V put a limit on their number, and Pope Alexander VII combined the limited number of voting referendaries into a college, assisted by the simple referendaries, who had only a consultative position. The Signatura gratiae gradually lost its functions to other bodies, and the growth of the work of the Roman Rota, the foundation of the Congregations of Cardinals resulted in the Signatura iustitiae becoming mainly a Supreme Court of the Papal States. Palazzo Riario o Cancelleria nuova 1628. On 29 June 1908, Pope Pius X reestablished a single Apostolic Signatura consisting of six cardinals, one of whom acted as its prefect. On 28 June 1915, Pope Benedict XV reconstituted the college of the voting referendaries and simple referendaries with consultative functions and the 1917 Code of Canon Law removed the limitation of the number of cardinals members of this Supreme Tribunal. The present competence of the Apostolic Signatura is that laid down in the apostolic constitution Pastor Bonus of 28 June 1988.Annuario Pontificio 2008, pp. 1896-1897Catholic Encyclopedia: Roman Curia On 16 March 2020, Pope Francis issued a new Vatican City civil law which makes the Apostolic Signatura itself the final court of cassation for Vatican City State and provides for greater independence of judicial bodies and magistrates dependent on the Pope. It also specifies the requirements for the appointment of judges and it simplifies the judicial system while increasing the staff of the court.https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2020-03/new-law-for- vatican-city-responds-to-current-needs.html Prior to that, the Cardinal Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura had served ex officio as the President of the Supreme Court of Vatican City (Corte di Cassazione).

He was inducted to the Greater Wilmington Sports Hall of Fame in 2016. Playing career Bunting grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland and graduated from Springbrook High School in 1968. He was a starting linebacker for the University of North Carolina from 1969 to 1971 under Coach Bill Dooley. In 1971, Bunting earned All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors and helped lead the Tar Heels to their first outright ACC title, in 1971. He had an eleven-year NFL career as a linebacker with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1972 to 1982, and he played in Philadelphia's Super Bowl XV game against the Oakland Raiders. Bunting then played for the Philadelphia Stars of the United States Football League from 1983 to 1984. Coaching career After retiring as an NFL player, Bunting moved into the coaching ranks. He served as a defensive assistant for three NFL teams: Kansas City Chiefs, St. Louis Rams, and the New Orleans Saints. As the Rams' co-defensive coordinator (along with Peter Giunta), he played a key role in leading that team to their victory in Super Bowl XXXIV. From 1988 to 1992, he served as head coach at Rowan University (known as Glassboro State during his first three seasons), compiling a 38-14-2 record. In December 2000, UNC athletic director Dick Baddour decided to hire him as the school's head football coach, replacing the fired Carl Torbush. In his first season, Bunting led the Tar Heels to an 8-5 record and a victory over Auburn in the 2001 Peach Bowl. However, his teams since were highly inconsistent. Bunting compiled an overall record of 27 wins and 45 losses over six seasons, and notched only two winning records in ACC play. Bunting does own UNC's only two wins over a team ranked in the top 10 of a major media poll in school history. In his first game as head coach, the Tar Heels beat nine-time defending ACC champion Florida State 41-9; the Seminoles were ranked sixth in the AP Poll at the time. After the 2003 season, a season in which the Tar Heels did not appear in a bowl game, Bunting was a coach in the final Blue-Gray All-Star Classic. In 2004, the Tar Heels defeated Miami 31-28 on a last-second field goal by Connor Barth; the Hurricanes were ranked fourth at the time in the AP poll. On the other end of the spectrum, his 2005 team was routed 69-14 by Louisville, one of the worst losses in modern Tar Heel history. During his final season (2006), his team had a record of 3-9, while averaging over 23 fewer points per game than their opponents. Baddour fired Bunting on October 22, 2006, but allowed Bunting to finish out the season. His last home victory on November 18, 2006, against North Carolina State University, broke a seven-game losing streak, and he was able to close out his career one week later with a 45-44 win over the Duke Blue Devils. Since his split with North Carolina, Bunting has been working as a commentator and announcer for college football. Personal life Bunting is married to Dawn Bunting and he has two children from his first marriage. They live in Naples, Florida.

The route runs from an interchange with U.S. Route 422 (US 422) near Valley Forge northeast to PA 63 in Lansdale. The route runs through suburban areas of central Montgomery County, passing some farmland in Worcester Township. PA 363 is designated along Trooper Road, Ridge Pike, Park Avenue, and Valley Forge Road. In the community of Worcester, the route crosses PA 73. PA 363 was first designated by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in 1928 to run from PA 23 in Port Kennedy to PA 63 in Lansdale. Between the 1940s and the 1960s, PA 363 extended west on present-day PA 23 to end near Valley Forge. In the 1960s, the route was redirected to follow Gulph Road to US 202 in King of Prussia. By 1989, the south end of PA 363 was relocated to the US 422 interchange. The Betzwood Bridge, which had carried PA 363 over the Schuylkill River, was removed in the 1990s. The partial interchange with US 422 became a full interchange in 2015. Route description PA 363 northbound past Egypt Road in Audubon PA 363 begins at an interchange with US 422 (Pottstown Expressway) near Valley Forge National Historical Park in Montgomery County. From this point, the route heads northeast on four-lane divided Trooper Road, forming the border between Lower Providence Township to the northwest and West Norriton Township to the southeast as it runs through the community of Audubon. The road passes a business park to the northwest and residential neighborhoods to the southeast as it narrows into an undivided road and enters areas of shopping centers. Here, the route becomes a divided highway again and intersects Egypt Road. PA 363 continues as a two-lane undivided road past more homes before it reaches the Ridge Pike/West Main Street intersection. At this point, the route turns northwest onto Ridge Pike and fully enters Lower Providence Township, passing businesses as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. PA 363 turns northeast onto two-lane Park Avenue in Trooper and runs through more residential areas. A short distance after entering Worcester Township, the route comes to the community of Fairview Village and crosses Germantown Pike in a commercial area. Upon crossing Germantown Pike, PA 363 becomes known as Valley Forge Road and continues into agricultural areas with scattered residential neighborhoods. The amount of development increases until the road comes to the junction with PA 73 (Skippack Pike) in the community of Worcester. After the PA 73 intersection, PA 363 continues past areas of housing developments to the west and farmland to the east before it reaches Morris Road. At this point, the route enters the North Penn Valley region and becomes the border between Towamencin Township to the northwest and Upper Gwynedd Township to the southeast, crossing under Interstate 476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) along this stretch. The road passes through residential neighborhoods before entering commercial areas and crossing Sumneytown Pike. PA 363 heads to the southeast of North Penn High School and runs past a mix of homes and businesses as it gains a center left-turn lane on the approach to the Allentown Road junction. A short distance later, the route enters the borough of Lansdale and passes homes as a two-lane road. PA 363 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 63 in Lansdale.  History  PA 363 northbound past Ridge Pike in Trooper When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, present-day PA 363 was not given a number with the exception of the Ridge Pike portion, which was designated as part of Legislative Route 146. In 1928, PA 363 was designated to run between PA 23 in the Port Kennedy section of Upper Merion Township and PA 63 in Lansdale. The route headed north across the Schuylkill River near the present US 422 bridge, before heading north on Trooper Road and east on Egypt Road to an intersection with US 422 (Ridge Pike). PA 363 headed west concurrent with US 422 before heading north on Park Avenue and following its current alignment north to Lansdale. At this time, the route was paved between PA 23 and the north end of the US 422 concurrency. By 1930, PA 363 was rerouted to follow Trooper Road between Egypt Road and US 422. At this time, the entire length of the route was paved. By 1945, PA 363 was extended west to end at PA 23 a short distance to the east of the community of Valley Forge. This portion of route was cosigned with PA 23 Truck by 1950. PA 363 was rerouted to follow Gulph Road from Port Kennedy to US 202 in King of Prussia, with PA 23 being rerouted to follow the former PA 363 between Valley Forge and Port Kennedy, by 1967. Also by this time, the US 422 concurrency on Ridge Pike had been removed and a freeway had been built that connected PA 363 a short distance north of the Schuylkill River to the US 202 freeway on the border of Chester and Montgomery counties. By 1989, the southern terminus of PA 363 was cut back to its current location at the US 422 interchange. In 1991, the Betzwood Bridge, which had carried PA 363 over the Schuylkill River, was closed because of structural issues. The bridge was removed in 1995 and limited bicycle and pedestrian access to Valley Forge National Historical Park from the north, with a temporary bike path being erected on the parallel US 422 bridge. There were plans to replace the Betzwood Bridge with a structure carrying two vehicle traffic lanes and a multi-use trail. These plans never advanced. Ultimately, the National Park Service secured federal funding for a mixed-use trail bridge to connect the trails in the north and south sides of Valley Forge National Historical Park at the site of the old bridge. Named Sullivan's Bridge after Revolutionary War General John Sullivan, construction began on the new bridge in May 2014 and it opened August 19, 2016 for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. In addition, improvements to the interchange between PA 363 and US 422, which added a ramp from PA 363 to westbound US 422 and from eastbound US 422 to PA 363, started in 2013. The new ramps opened to traffic on December 1, 2015.

Since 2005 it has been headquartered at the Renzo Piano designed Parco della Musica in Rome. It was founded as a \\"congregation\\", or \\"confraternity\\", and over the centuries has grown from a forum for local musicians and composers to an internationally acclaimed academy active in music scholarship (with 100 prominent music scholars forming the body of the Accademia), music education (in its role as a conservatory) and performance (with an active choir and a symphony orchestra, the Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia). The list of alumni of the associated conservatory (which in 1919 succeeded a liceo) includes many noted composers and performers. History The first seat of the Congregation from 1585‚Äì1622 was the church of Santa Maria ad Martires, better known as the Pantheon. Successive relocations were to the church of San Paolino alla Colonna (1622‚Äì52), Santa Cecilia in Trastevere (1652‚Äì61), San Nicola dei Cesarini (1661‚Äì1663), Chiesa della Maddalena (1663‚Äì85), and, finally, San Carlo ai Catinari in 1685. Musicians of the Academy posing before the concert they gave at the Palazzo Doria Pamphili, Rome. Giuseppe Branzoli, seated in the foreground, holds a mandolone During the first century of existence, the Congregation was the workshop of a number of prominent musicians and composers of the day, including Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. The institution in that period was often in rivalry with the other important musical organization of Papal Rome of the day, the Sistine Choir. Rivalry centred on the rights to control access to the musical profession, to train musicians, and to publish music. The rivalry never really ended and can be said to have lasted through the entire existence of the Papal States, that is, until 1870, when the \\"temporal power of the Church\\" was ended by military action of the new nation state of Italy. The early 18th century is considered to have been a particularly glorious time for the Accademia. Among names associated with the organization during that period are Arcangelo Corelli, Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti, and Niccol√≤ Jommelli. In 1716, Pope Clement XI decreed that all musicians practising their profession in Rome were required to become members of the Congregation. The Accademia suspended operations during the revolutionary period of the Napoleonic Wars but opened regularly again in 1822 a few years after the Restoration brought about by the Congress of Vienna. The years between that reopening and the end of the Papal States in 1870 were ones of great change. The organization opened its membership to hitherto excluded categories, such as dancers, poets, music historians, musical instrument makers, and music publishers. In 1838, the Congregation of Santa Cecilia was officially proclaimed an Academy and then a Papal Academy. The list of active and honorary members of the Accademia during that period is formidable and includes Cherubini, Mercadante, Donizetti, Rossini, Paganini, Auber, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Berlioz, Gounod, and Meyerbeer. Among the crowned heads of Europe who were honorary members was Queen Victoria. After the unification of Italy, the Accademia reestablished itself with the formation of a permanent symphony orchestra and choir, beginning in 1895. It went from being the seat of a Liceo musicale‚Äîa music \\"high school\\"‚Äîto being a full-blown conservatory; also, it hosts the \\"Eleonora Duse\\" Drama School, as well as a centre for experimental cinema. The most recent innovation has been the digitisation and cataloguing of centuries of musical documents‚Äîincluding an important collection of traditional music in the ethnomusicological archives‚Äîand their preservation and eventual display in the Accademia's multimedia library and archive also available to the public online. The Accademia also maintains a musical instruments museum (the MUSA).

It is located along U.S. Route 9 in the town of Colonie, a dense suburb north of Albany. As of the 2010 census, the population was 20,736. Latham was a census-designated place in the 1970, 1980, and 1990 US Census, but ceased to be in the 2000 Census, but became a CDP again in 2020. History The area was known at different times in its history as Yearsley's (c. 1829), Van Vranken's (c. 1851), Town House Corners (c. 1860) and Latham's Corners, named after hotel owner William G. Latham. The \\"corner\\" referred to is now the intersection of Troy-Schenectady Road (NY Route 2) and Old Loudon Road. Before European expansion to North America, Latham was occupied by Mohicans. The Old Loudon Road was built in 1755 during the French and Indian War to bring troops and provisions from Albany to the areas of Lake George and Ticonderoga. The Troy and Schenectady Turnpike was built in 1802 and intersected Old Loudon. An early first resident of this hamlet was Jonas Yearsley, 1785, who later built the first hotel close to this intersection. The hamlet was known first under the name of Yearsley's Corners and years afterward as Van Vrankens Corners in the 1850s. The name changed into Latham when William Latham became owner of the hotel. James, his son, continued to run the hotel until he died on August 14, 1933. Geography The hamlet itself is very narrow east-west and relatively long north-south, centered on the intersection of the Troy-Schenectady Road and Old Loudon Road. As a hamlet its boundaries are inexact though they are marked by the New York State Department of Transportation on the west and east ends on New York Route 2 and on the south end on U.S. Route 9 (US 9). On the west end the hamlet begins near the entrance to the former Latham Circle Mall; on the south end it starts near the Y-intersection of US 9 and Old Loudon Road; and on the east end the border is near the Kiwanis Park. The northern border is the Crescent Bridge crossing the Mohawk River into Halfmoon in Saratoga County. Blue Creek circles the area known as Pirate's Island. The area normally referred to as \\"Latham\\" extends well beyond the hamlet itself, as the name is also used for the post office of the 12110 ZIP Code. Many locations often considered in the northern and northeastern parts of Latham are in the Cohoes ZIP Code, while many in the eastern sections use a Watervliet ZIP Code. Latham's terrain is mostly a hilly mix of deciduous and evergreen trees, with some ponds, creeks and swamps, including several protected water courses and New York State Wetlands. Streams east of Old Loudon Road and US 9 generally drain into the Hudson River; west of Old Loudon and US 9, the hamlet's watercourses drain into the Mohawk River.

It broadcast a digital signal on virtual and UHF channel 22 from a transmitter near Walker, Iowa. History KWWF opened on December 1, 2002, with a format of infomercials, home shopping and public domain reruns. Later, the station began airing religious programs from LeSEA Broadcasting. Equity Broadcasting bought the station in 2004, and quickly made it a general entertainment station. KWWF affiliated with UPN on September 13, 2004 and the station soon gained carriage on cable systems throughout the market. Under Equity ownership, the station's master control, located in Little Rock, Arkansas, relayed its signal via the Galaxy 18 satellite to the transmitter and area cable systems. In 2006, with the end of UPN, KWWF became an affiliate of Equity Broadcasting's own Retro Television Network to fill the gaps left by the end of UPN programming. However, in 2008, most RTN programming was removed from KWWF and moved to a digital subchannel of KWWL. KWWF became an independent station, carrying various syndicated programs, as well as a handful of Equity-produced live shows, which were also aired on many RTN stations. KWWF was sold to Valley Bank at auction on April 16, 2009. Valley Bank, in turn, filed to sell KWWF to an ownership group connected to Fusion Communications in August. Because it was granted an original construction permit after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) finalized the DTV allotment plan on April 21, 1997,http://www.transmitter.com/FCC97115/chanplan.html the station did not receive a companion channel for a digital television station. Instead, at the end of the digital TV conversion period for full-service stations, KWWF was required to turn off its analog signal and turn on its digital signal (called a \\"flash-cut\\"). , this station was scheduled to go dark in 2009. According to the station's DTV status report, \\"On December 8, 2008, the licensee's parent corporation filed a petition for bankruptcy relief under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code... This station must obtain post-petition financing and court approval before digital facilities may be constructed. The station will cease analogue broadcasting on February 17, 2009, regardless of whether digital facilities are operational by that date. The station will file authority to remain silent if so required by the FCC.\\"FCC DTV status report While the DTV Delay Act extended this deadline to June 12, 2009, Equity applied for an extension of the digital construction permit, in order to retain the broadcast license in case the station went dark. Fusion Communications was able to build a temporary digital site near Walker to meet the deadline. At the end of analogue broadcasting on June 12, 2009, KWWF transitioned from the old Equity facility to Fusion's Iowa master control facility and continued to provide a signal to cable systems. Thereafter, KWWF was affiliated with Untamed Sports TV. KWWF's satellite feed was still available on Anik F3 C-Band as of November 2010. Although the station transmitted in 720p, Untamed Sports never maintained a high definition programming feed and all programming on the station was carried in standard definition. In 2012, Fusion Communications was acquired by Stratus Media Holdings. KWWF ceased broadcasting on August 2, 2013, due to financial difficulties. On August 8, 2013, the station's owners filed a Notification of Suspension of Operations / Request for Silent STA with the FCC.Federal Communications Commission: Notification of Suspension of Operations / Request for Silent STA for KWWF, August 8. 2013.

District 303 serves about 13,590 students from the City of St. Charles and portions of West Chicago, South Elgin, Wayne, Campton Hills, a very small portion of Elgin and unincorporated Kane County. History When formal school districts were originally created in the late 19th century and early 20th century, they were usually drawn along township boundaries. However, legislation was passed in 1946-47 that encouraged school districts to consolidate. Community Unit School District 303 was born in 1949 when, through a referendum, voters approved consolidating High School District 150, Elementary District 87 and Little Woods District 79. People served by the Wasco two-year high school program voted in 1950 to consolidate with District 303 after another change in state law eliminated two-year high schools. Schools The district operates 11 elementary schools, two middle schools, and two high schools, serving about 13,590 students. Athletes from both high schools belong to the DuKane Conference *Elementaries (K-5) Anderson Elementary School Bell-Graham Elementary School Corron Elementary School Davis Primary School Richmond Intermediate School Ferson Creek Elementary School Lincoln Elementary School Munhall Elementary School Norton Creek Elementary School Wasco Elementary School Wild Rose Elementary School  In 2005, District 303 purchased at the corner of Crane and Silver Glen roads with the intention of building an additional elementary and middle school (in a single joined facility) at that location. Referendums in 2005 and 2006 intended to finance construction of the schools failed to pass.2005 referendum; 2006 referendum. *Middle Schools (6-8) Thompson Middle School - Thunder Wredling Middle School - Redhawks *High Schools (9-12) St. Charles East High School - Saints St. Charles North High School - North Stars =Davis-Richmond merger= In 2010, the school district decided to combine Davis, an overcrowded elementary school, and Richmond, a failing school that was only at 50% capacity, to create Davis Primary (grades K-2) and Richmond Intermediate (grades 3-5). The schools are close together so transportation was easy. The school days at Richmond were made 40 minutes longer. Spanish and French language courses were offered and every student was given their own tablet. Students District 303's composite ACT score for 2005 was 21.8 compared to a state average of 20.1.St. Charles Community Unit School District 3030. 81.7 percent of all District 303 students met or exceeded state learning standards in 2005 (85.8 percent ISAT; 70.4 percent Prairie State Achievement Exam.) Statewide, an average of 64.9 percent of all students met or exceeded state learning standards in 2005 (68.9 percent ISAT; 54.9 percent PSAE.) Curriculum District 303 staff is actively involved in curriculum renewal and redesign in partnership with the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy along with Brown University. Parent organizations District 303 parent organizations include school-level and district Parent Teacher Organizations. Finances District 303 operates on a $118.3 million annual operating budget (FY '06) Total operating revenues are about $120 million. Total expenses including construction and bonded debt are $137 million, versus total revenues (all funds) of $134 million. Staff District 303 employs about 1,750 full and part-time staffers in 2005-06, including about 1,065 certificated staff. That number includes about 1,000 teachers. Staff are represented by four professional associations: the St. Charles Education Association (representing certificated staff); the St. Charles Transportation and Maintenance Association; the St. Charles Educational Support Professionals Association; and the Therapy Association of St. Charles. Teacher profile The average teacher salary in 2005 was $52,502. The average teacher had 10.9 years of experience in 2004-2005. About 57 percent of District 303 teachers hold Master's Degrees or higher. Growth District 303 grew significantly since the start of the 21st century. About 250 new students enrolled in District 303 for the 2005-06 school year. Growth of 300-500 new students was expected to continue for the next three to five years.

Caregiving behaviours are aimed at reducing the partner's distress and supporting his or her coping efforts in situations of either threat or challenge. Caregiving may include emotional support (expressions of care, affection, sympathy, and encouragement) and/or instrumental support (provision of information, advice, and tangible resources). Effective caregiving behaviour enhances the care-recipient's psychological well-being, as well as the quality of the relationship between the caregiver and the care-recipient. However, certain suboptimal caregiving strategies may be either ineffective or even detrimental to coping. The caregiving behavioural system=Evolutionary origins= Attachment theory, an influential theoretical framework for the study of intimate relationships and personality development, argues that all humans are born with the capacity and motivation to engage in caregiving behaviours aimed at providing protection and support to close others. These behaviours are organized by an innate behavioural system, called the caregiving system, which is believed to have emerged over the course of primate evolution to ensure the survival of vulnerable offspring. That is, because infants in many primate species, including humans, are highly altricial (i.e., developmentally immature and helpless at birth), they cannot survive without caregiver support and protection. Attachment theory proposes that this evolutionary pressure favoured the emergence of the caregiving behavioural system, which functions to safeguard the vulnerable dependent from harm by providing him or her with protection, comfort, and help during times of threat or need. Although this system was first conceptualized in child‚Äìparent bonds, its operation has since been established in adult intimate relationships, where both partners may occasionally take on the role of caregiver. =Functions of the caregiving system= According to attachment theory, the two goals of the caregiving behavioural system are to protect close others from harm and decrease their suffering during times of threat, and to promote close others‚Äô personal growth and exploratory behaviour. Attachment theorists call the former aspect of caregiving behaviour ‚Äúproviding a safe haven‚Äù, and the latter ‚Äúproviding a secure base‚Äù. The caregiving system is therefore likely to be activated when an individual perceives that a close relationship partner is experiencing danger or distress, or when the partner has an opportunity for exploration, learning, or mastery of a new skill, and could benefit from help in pursuing the opportunity or from celebration of his/her accomplishments and goal strivings. =Interrelation with attachment system= Attachment theory also postulates that all humans possess an innate attachment behavioural system that motivates them to seek proximity to a caregiver (also called an attachment figure) during times of threat or need. Caregiving behaviour is therefore complementary to attachment behaviour. Furthermore, attachment theory argues that the effectiveness of the caregiving behaviour enacted determines the quality of the attachment bond between the caregiver and care- recipient, as well as shapes the care-recipient‚Äôs general expectations of social support. In this model, a history of receiving effective care from intimate others (whether parents in childhood or romantic partners in adulthood) promotes a sense of attachment security ‚Äì an interpersonal orientation characterized by the expectation that other people may be relied on for support, and subsequent comfort with intimacy and emotional closeness. In contrast, a history of interactions with cold or rejecting caregivers promotes attachment avoidance ‚Äì an interpersonal orientation marked by discomfort with intimacy, a reluctance to rely on others for support, and the tendency to suppress emotional distress. Care that is inconsistent or intrusive is believed to foster attachment anxiety, which is characterized by excessive preoccupation with intimate relationships and inability to effectively regulate one‚Äôs own emotional distress. Effective caregiving=Key concepts= The central component of effective caregiving is the taking on of what Batson (1991) called an empathic stance toward another person's suffering or needs. This means adopting the perspective, or \\"putting oneself in the shoes,\\" of the partner in order to help lessen his or her distress in a stressful situation, or to help him or her pursue personal growth and development goals in challenging contexts. The empathic stance is characterized by two key, related components: sensitivity and responsiveness (although note that these terms are sometimes used interchangeably in the caregiving and social support literatures). Sensitivity refers to the ability to effectively detect and interpret the partner's cues of distress, worry, or need, and to provide the type and amount of support that is well matched to the partner's wants and needs. This tailoring of caregiving efforts to the particular characteristics of the specific situation is essential for effective care. Responsiveness is the ability to provide support in a way that makes the partner feel understood (i.e., the caregiver has accurately captured the speaker's problem, needs, and emotions), validated (i.e., the caregiver confirms that the care recipient is a valued individual and that his or her feelings and responses in the situation are reasonable), and cared for (i.e., caregiver should communicate affection and concern). Caregiving that lacks these two components may be ineffective or even detrimental to the care- recipient's well-being. For example, a study investigating the adjustment of breast cancer patients found that these women varied in the types of the support they desired, and mismatches between the type of support wanted and the type of support received (i.e., low sensitivity to the partner‚Äôs unique support needs) predicted worse adjustment. Unhelpful attempts at social support include: minimization (e.g., downplaying or denying the problem), maximization (e.g., catastrophizing, making the problem seem unwieldy or unresolvable), blaming or criticizing the partner for their misfortune, inducing feelings of guilt or indebtedness, and overinvolvement (e.g., being overly protective, making the care-recipient feel incompetent, inserting oneself into the problem when the partner wishes to solve it independently). =Invisible support= Even well-intentioned support can negatively impact the care recipient's psychological adjustment to stressful events if it is inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights the fact that the care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle the stressor by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but lowered levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the responsiveness of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness. That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of support hinges on responsiveness. Secure base function of caregiving=Definition and functions= In addition to giving support and reassurance during distress, another important function of caregiving within intimate relationships is the provision of support for a relationship partner's personal growth, exploration, and goal strivings. In attachment theory, this type of support is called providing a secure base and is postulated to encourage the relationship partner's confident, autonomous exploration of the environment outside of the attachment relationship. This phenomenon was originally observed in young children; children whose parents showed more intrusiveness were less likely to engage in play and exploration in a novel environment. =Components of the secure base= Feeney and Thrush (2010) have identified three main functional components of secure base caregiving. First, individuals can support their relationship partner's exploratory, autonomous behaviour by being available in case support is needed. This can include actions such as removing obstacles to the partner's goal pursuit (for example, taking over some household chores to free up time for the partner to engage in a new activity), being sensitive and responsive to the partner's communications of distress, and communicating readiness to help in the event that support becomes needed. Second, effective caregiving does not unnecessarily interfere with exploration. That is, effective caregivers do not provide support when it is neither needed nor desired, attempt to take over or control the activity, or disrupt the partner's goal strivings. Third, partners should communicate encouragement and acceptance of exploration (i.e., convey enthusiasm about the pursuit rather than suggest that it is not worthwhile or will somehow detract from the relationship). Individuals who perceive their partners to be available to help are more persistent in the performance of challenging activities, whereas individuals whose partners show more interference during an activity show less persistence at the task, poorer performance, less enthusiasm for the challenge, greater negativity/hostility toward their partner, and decreases in self-esteem. Partners' communications of enthusiasm are related to better performance, heightened enthusiasm, better mood, increases in state self-esteem, enhanced self-perceptions, greater enjoyment, and more positive feelings toward the partner. =Dependency paradox= All humans have a fundamental, evolutionarily-rooted need to feel socially connected to other people (i.e., to achieve \\"belongingness\\" or \\"relatedness\\"). Simultaneously, people also hold a need for \\"autonomy\\", or the desire to maintain a sense of independence and self-sufficiency. While these two psychological needs may initially appear to be contradictory (that is, it is not readily apparent how people may reconcile their need for social connection with their need for independence), psychological research shows that individuals who are more dependent on their intimate partners for support actually experience more autonomy, rather than less (a phenomenon that has been labelled the \\"dependency paradox\\"). For example, Feeney (2007) showed that individuals whose romantic partners were more comfortable with having their partner depend on them were more likely to independently pursue and achieve their personal goals over a period of 6 months (without their partner's direct assistance). Such research is consistent with the idea that the most effective type of support for promoting personal growth (e.g., accepting challenges, trying new things, exploring) is support that involves simply communicating availability, and that individuals who feel confident in the availability of a secure base to fall back on in case their goal pursuits go wrong are less likely to actually over-rely on their secure base. Capitalization In psychology, capitalization refers to the process of drawing additional benefits (e.g., increases in good mood) from a positive event by sharing it with other people. Research shows that individuals who share news of a positive event (such as, for example, acceptance to graduate school or a promotion at work) with a close other and receive a supportive response from that person, show increases in positive emotions and personal well-being above and beyond the boost given by the positive event itself. Furthermore, support for positive event sharing has positive implications for relationship well-being. Specifically, receipt of such support increases feelings of trust and the endorsement of a more prosocial orientation (i.e., the willingness to respond positively in an unpleasant or conflict situation involving one's relationship partner). Additionally, support for positive event sharing is more strongly linked to higher levels of relationship quality and lower likelihood of break-ups in the future than support extended during discussion of negative events. Gable and colleagues have delineated four basic types of responses individuals may exhibit when a relationship partner shares a positive event with them. Active- constructive responses clearly communicate enthusiasm for the positive event, passive-constructive responses express support in a quiet, understated way, active-destructive responses squash the event and the partner's enthusiasm (e.g., by pointing out potential down sides of the positive event), and passive-destructive responses ignore and/or communicate disinterest in the event. Only active-constructive responses are associated with emotional and relationship well-being. Variability in caregiving Although the tendency to care for intimate others is universal, there is wide variability in the quality and amount of caregiving that individuals enact. This variability is determined by a multitude of factors, including characteristics of the caregiver, the care recipient, and the relationship. =Caregiver characteristics=Motivation As effective caregiving involves a great amount of responsibility, as well as the expenditure of cognitive, emotional, and/or tangible resources, caregivers must be sufficiently motivated in order to provide responsive support to their relationship partner. That is, people who do not possess enough motivation to help will be less effective at providing care that is appropriate for their partner's needs. Furthermore, individuals may differ in the degree to which they hold altruistic versus egoistic motivations for helping. Altruistic motivations are centred on the desire to advance the significant other's welfare, whereas egoistic motivations are centred on the desire to gain benefits for oneself, or to avoid sanctions for not helping and/or other negative consequences to the self. More altruistic and less egoistic motivations for caregiving are linked to better outcomes for the care recipient and enhanced relationship quality. Another relevant line of research inquiry has demonstrated that individuals in romantic relationships may hold either approach or avoidance motivations for making sacrifices for their partner, and the particular type of motivation endorsed influences personal well-being and relationship quality. Approach motivations are oriented toward gaining positive outcomes, such as increases in intimacy or the partner's happiness. Avoidance motivations are oriented toward avoiding negative outcomes, such as conflict or the partner's loss of interest in the relationship. Sacrifice for approach motives is associated with more positive emotions and greater life and relationship satisfaction for both partners, as well as less relationship conflict. In contrast, sacrifice for avoidance motives is linked to less life and relationship satisfaction for both partners, more negative emotions and conflict for the person making the sacrifice, less positive emotions for the sacrifice recipient, as well as greater likelihood of breaking up. Skills, abilities, and resources Effective caregiving requires knowledge about how to support others, as well as sufficient cognitive and self-regulatory resources. For example, caregivers must be able to regulate the negative emotions aroused by witnessing another person in distress. Failure of this emotional regulation may lead the caregiver to become overcome by their personal distress, adopt the role of a needy person rather than the caregiver, or to distance him- or herself from the partner as a way of regulating that distress. Research shows that particularly severe or chronic stressors may overwhelm the caregiver and decrease his/her ability to provide support to the partner. For example, Bolger, Foster, Vinokur, and Ng (1996) found that breast cancer patients who experienced the highest levels of distress in the month immediately following their diagnosis were less likely to receive support from their husbands over the following six months. Another relevant skill is called empathic accuracy, which is defined as the ‚Äúability to accurately infer the specific content of another person‚Äôs thoughts and feelings (Ickes, 1993, p. 588). For example, caregivers higher on empathic accuracy tend to provide more instrumental support and less negative support (e.g., accusing or criticizing) to their spouse. Attachment style Attachment theory postulates that the quality of caregiving an individual receives shapes many of the skills and motivations necessary for that individual to enact caregiving him- or herself. Indeed, research shows that personal attachment style (i.e., level of attachment security versus attachment avoidance or anxiety) is tightly linked to beliefs about, and strategies in, providing care to dependent others. Attachment avoidance, which is characterized by discomfort with intimacy, is related to less support giving and with keeping distance from a partner in need, particularly when the partner is experiencing higher levels of distress. When avoidant individuals do provide support, they tend to be more controlling. Attachment anxiety is related to controlling, overinvolved, intrusive, and compulsive caregiving (e.g., preoccupation with the fear that the partner will leave them if they do not provide adequate care). For example, anxiously attached individuals provide higher levels of support to partners who are about to engage in a stressful laboratory task, and this support is not matched to the level of need expressed by their partner. Anxiously attached individuals also display more negative support behaviours, such as blaming. Secure attachment is associated with more effective forms of caregiving (i.e., care that is responsive and not overinvolved). =Care recipient characteristics= Because careseeking and caregiving are highly interdependent, complementary processes, individuals are more likely to receive caregiving efforts from their partner when they experience and express higher levels of distress or need. More generally, psychology research on helping suggests that one of the strongest determinants of helping behaviour is the structure of the situation ‚Äì more specifically, the degree to which potential helpers are able to notice that the need for help exists. In the context of romantic relationships, researchers have similarly argued that in order to enact caregiving, individuals must first realize that their partner requires care. Therefore, one potential obstacle to caregiving behaviour is that the person in need of help may not actively seek support from the caregiver, or may communicate their need for support through indirect strategies (e.g., hinting, sulking, sighing) that are overly ambiguous. However, while greater communications of need can effectively elicit support, behaviours such as excessive reassurance seeking (a behavioural pattern in which individuals continue to seek support and reassurance even after such reassurance has already been provided) can strain the relationship and undermine helping. =Qualities of the relationship= Researchers have argued that individuals in high quality relationships, in which partners feel attached and committed to each other, should evidence more motivation to provide responsive support to their partner. Indeed, one‚Äôs own sense of relationship satisfaction and relationship interdependence (the degree to which the caregiver feels close and committed to the partner) are positively related to the amount of support one provides. For example, daily diary studies of caregiving have observed that individuals tend to provide more support to their partners on days they feel more satisfied with their relationships (however, a reverse interpretation ‚Äì that caregiving increases relationship satisfaction ‚Äì is also possible). In addition, caregivers who are more satisfied with their relationships report more altruistic motives for providing support. Benefits of caregiving Receipt of social support, or the perception that social support will be readily available when needed, is linked to a multitude of benefits, including improvements in mood and self- esteem. Provision of effective care can also benefit the caregiver because it is likely to foster feelings of self-worth and efficacy, build confidence in one's interpersonal skills, promote the self-view that one is a moral person, and increase feelings of love and social connectedness. Research has also linked the provision of social support within intimate relationships to enhanced relationship satisfaction for the care recipient and caregiver. For example, higher levels of support in newlywed couples predicted higher relationship satisfaction two years later. Responsive care is especially important for relationship satisfaction.

A disposionist is a person who believes in lay dispositionism, the tendency to use personality traits or other dispositions (e.g., intelligence) to explain and predict social actions or outcomes (Ross & Nisbett, 1991). For example, a dispositionist might explain bankruptcy as the largely self-inflicted result of personal laziness and/or imprudence. Situationists, in contrast, view bankruptcy as frequently caused by more complicated external forces, such as divorce or the medical and other costs of unanticipated illness. Lay dispositionism has been evaluated in relationship to implicit theories of personality. (See also: fundamental attribution error). The opposite of dispositionism is \\"situationism\\". Dispositionism, regulatory capture and deep capture Dispositionism as a concept has also been used in political science (regulatory capture), law and economics (regulatory economics). First a quick example illustrating fundamental attribution error often called actor‚Äìobserver bias. If Alice saw Bob trip over a rock and fall, Alice might consider Bob to be clumsy or careless (dispositional). If Alice tripped over the same rock herself, she would be more likely to blame the placement of the rock (situational). This different perspective on essentially same thing is what allows to regulatory capture and deep capture, discussed below. The idea of regulatory capture has an obvious economic basis, in that vested interests in an industry have the greatest financial stake in regulatory activity and are more likely to be motivated to influence the regulatory body than dispersed individual consumers,Timothy B. Lee, \\"Entangling the Web\\" The New York Times (August 3, 2006). Retrieved April 1, 2011 each of whom have little particular incentive to try to influence regulators. When regulators form expert bodies to examine policy, this invariably features current or former industry members, or at the very least, individuals with contacts in the industry. Some economists, such as Jon Hanson and his co-authors, argue that the phenomenon extends beyond just political agencies and organizations. Businesses have an incentive to control anything that has power over them, including institutions from the media, academia and popular culture, thus they will try to capture them as well. This phenomenon is called deep capture.Jon D. Hanson and David G.

Anti-consumerism is concerned with the private actions of business corporations in pursuit of financial and economic goals at the expense of the public welfare, especially in matters of environmental protection, social stratification, and ethics in the governing of a society. In politics, anti-consumerism overlaps with environmental activism, anti-globalization, and animal-rights activism; moreover, a conceptual variation of anti-consumerism is post-consumerism, living in a material way that transcends consumerism. Anti-consumerism arose in response to the problems caused by the long-term mistreatment of human consumers and of the animals consumed, and from the incorporation of consumer education to school curricula; examples of anti-consumerism are the book No Logo (2000) by Naomi Klein, and documentary films such as The Corporation (2003), by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott, and Surplus: Terrorized into Being Consumers (2003), by Erik Gandini; each made anti-corporate activism popular as an ideologically accessible form of civil and political action. The criticism of economic materialism as a dehumanizing behaviour that is destructive of the Earth, as human habitat, comes from religion and social activism. The religious criticism asserts that materialist consumerism interferes with the connection between the individual and God, and so is an inherently immoral style of life; thus the German historian Oswald Spengler (1880‚Äì1936) said that, \\"Life in America is exclusively economic in structure, and lacks depth.\\"Stearns, Peter. Consumerism in World History. Routledge From the Roman Catholic perspective, Thomas Aquinas said that, \\"Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things\\"; in that vein, Francis of Assisi, Ammon Hennacy, and Mohandas Gandhi said that spiritual inspiration guided them towards simple living. From the secular perspective, social activism indicates that from consumerist materialism derive crime (which originates from the poverty of economic inequality), industrial pollution and the consequent environmental degradation, and war as a business. About the societal discontent born of malaise and hedonism, Pope Benedict XVI said that the philosophy of materialism offers no raison d'√™tre for human existence;Web log. 17 July 2008. http://babs22.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/australia-pope-attacks- consumerism/ likewise, the writer Georges Duhamel said that \\"American materialism [is] a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization\\". Background Anti-consumerism originated from criticism of consumption, starting with Thorstein Veblen, who, in the book The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions (1899), indicated that consumerism dates from the cradle of civilization. The term consumerism also denotes economic policies associated with Keynesian economics, and the belief that the free choice of consumers should dictate the economic structure of a society (cf. producerism). Politics and society An anti-consumerist stencil graffiti saying \\"Consuming consumes you\\" Many anti-corporate activists believe the rise of large-business corporations poses a threat to the legitimate authority of nation states and the public sphere. They feel corporations are invading people's privacy, manipulating politics and governments, and creating false needs in consumers. They state evidence such as invasive advertising adware, spam, telemarketing, child-targeted advertising, aggressive guerrilla marketing, massive corporate campaign contributions in political elections, interference in the policies of sovereign nation states (Ken Saro-Wiwa), and news stories about corporate corruption (Enron, for example). Clinard, M. B. (1990) Corporate corruption: The abuse of power. Greenwood Publishing Anti-consumerism protesters point out that the main responsibility of a corporation is to answer only to shareholders, giving human rights and other issues almost no consideration. The management does have a primary responsibility to their shareholders, since any philanthropic activities that do not directly serve the business could be deemed to be a breach of trust. This sort of financial responsibility means that multi-national corporations will pursue strategies to intensify labor and reduce costs. For example, they will attempt to find low wage economies with laws which are conveniently lenient on human rights, the natural environment, trade union organization and so on (see, for example, Nike). An important contribution to the critique of consumerism has been made by French philosopher Bernard Stiegler, arguing modern capitalism is governed by consumption rather than production, and the advertising techniques used to create consumer behaviour amount to the destruction of psychic and collective individuation. The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle of consumption, leading to hyper consumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery. In art, Banksy, influential British graffiti master, painter, activist, filmmaker and all-purpose provocateur has made statements in public works about the consumerist society. Working undercover, the secretive street artist challenges social ideas and goads viewers into rethinking their surroundings, to acknowledge the absurdities of closely held preconceptions. Quote from Banksy: ‚ÄúYou owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don‚Äôt owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don‚Äôt even start asking for theirs.‚Äù After 2003, Banksy wrote the New Yorker by e-mail: ‚ÄúI give away thousands of paintings for free. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to make art about world poverty and trouser all the cash.‚Äù Banksy believes that there is a consumerist shift in art, and for the first time, the bourgeois world of art belongs to the people. On his website, he provides high-resolution images of his work for free downloading. =Conspicuous consumption= In many critical contexts, the term describes the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially with commercial brand names and obvious status-enhancing appeal, such as a brand of expensive automobiles or jewelry. It is a pejorative term which most people deny, having some more specific excuse or rationalization for consumption other than the idea that they are \\"compelled to consume\\". A culture that has a high amount of consumerism is referred to as a consumer culture. To those who embrace the idea of consumerism, these products are not seen as valuable in themselves, but rather as social signals that allow them to identify like-minded people through consumption and display of similar products. Few would yet go so far, though, as to admit that their relationships with a product or brand name could be substitutes for healthy human relationships that sometimes lack in a dysfunctional modern society. The older term conspicuous consumption described the United States in the 1960s, but was soon linked to larger debates about media influence, culture jamming, and its corollary productivism. Anti-consumerist stencil art The term and concept of conspicuous consumption originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writing of economist Thorstein Veblen. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen's scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following, from his 1899 book, The Theory of the Leisure Class: In 1955, economist Victor Lebow stated (as quoted by William Rees, 2009): According to archaeologists, evidence of conspicuous consumption up to several millennia ago has been found, suggesting that such behavior is inherent to humans. =Consumerism and advertising= Anti- consumerists believe advertising plays a huge role in human life by informing values and assumptions of the cultural system, deeming what is acceptable and determining social standards.[ Advertising and the End of the World. Dir. Sut Jhally. Perf. Sut Jhally. DVD. Media Education Foundation, 1997.] They declare that ads create a hyper-real world where commodities appear as the key to securing happiness. Anti-consumerists cite studies that find that individuals believe their quality of life improves in relation to social values that lie outside the capability of the market place. Therefore, advertising attempts to equate the social with the material by utilizing images and slogans to link commodities with the real sources of human happiness, such as meaningful relationships. Ads are then a detriment to society because they tell consumers that accumulating more and more possessions will bring them closer to self- actualization, or the concept of a complete and secure being. \\"The underlying message is that owning these products will enhance our image and ensure our popularity with others.\\"[Tim Kasser, \\"The High Price of Materialism\\", 2002, p.9, Achorn Graphic Services] And while advertising promises that a product will make the consumer happy, advertising simultaneously depends upon the consumer never being truly happy, as then the consumer would no longer feel the need to consume needless products. Anti-consumerists claim that in a consumerist society, advertisement images disempower and objectify the consumer.Joseph D. Rumbo, \\"Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters\\", Psychology and Marketing, Vol.19(2), February 2002 By stressing individual power, choice and desire, advertising falsely implies the control lies with the consumer. Because anti-consumerists believe commodities supply only short-term gratification, they detract from a sustainably happy society. Further, advertisers have resorted to new techniques of capturing attention, such as the increased speed of ads and product placements. In this way, commercials infiltrate the consumerist society and become an inextricable part of culture. Anti-consumerists condemn advertising because it constructs a simulated world that offers fantastical escapism to consumers, rather than reflecting actual reality. They further argue that ads depict the interests and lifestyles of the elite as natural; cultivating a deep sense of inadequacy among viewers. They denounce use of beautiful models because they glamorize the commodity beyond reach of the average individual. In an opinion segment of New Scientist magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited William Rees of the University of British Columbia and epidemiologist Warren Hern of the University of Colorado at Boulder, saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are \\"subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world's existing inequalities.\\" According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America, human society is in a \\"global overshoot\\", consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world's resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic \\"bio-capacities\\", and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries. Austrian economics Austrian economic advocates focus on the entrepreneur, promoting a productive lifestyle rather than a materialistic one wherein the individual is defined by things and not their self. Criticism Many have accused anti-consumerists of opposing modernity or utilitarianism. Right-wing critics see anti-consumerism as rooted in socialism. In 1999, the right- libertarian magazine Reason attacked anti-consumerism, claiming Marxist academics are repackaging themselves as anti-consumerists. James B. Twitchell, a professor at the University of Florida and popular writer, referred to anti- consumerist arguments as \\"Marxism Lite.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080207201008/https://reason.com/news/show/27795.html There have also been socialist critics of anti-consumerism who see it as a form of anti-modern \\"reactionary socialism\\", and state that anti-consumerism has also been adopted by ultra-conservatives and fascists. In popular media In Fight Club, the protagonist finds himself participating in terroristic acts against corporate society and consumer culture. In Mr. Robot, Elliot Alderson, a young cybersecurity engineer, joins a hacker group known as fsociety, which aims to crash the U.S. economy, eliminating all debt. In the novel American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis, the protagonist Patrick Bateman criticizes the consumerist society of America in the 1980s of which he is a personification. Later on he goes on a killing spree without any consequences, suggesting that the people around him are so self-absorbed and focused on consuming that they either don't see or don't care about his acts.

Uncompetitive inhibition typically occurs in reactions with two or more substrates or products. While uncompetitive inhibition requires that an enzyme-substrate complex must be formed, non- competitive inhibition can occur with or without the substrate present. Uncompetitive inhibition is distinguished from competitive inhibition by two observations: first uncompetitive inhibition cannot be reversed by increasing [S] and second, as shown, the Lineweaver‚ÄìBurk plot yields parallel rather than intersecting lines. This behavior is found in the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by tertiary amines (R3N). Such compounds bind to the enzyme in its various forms, but the acyl-intermediate-amine complex cannot break down into enzyme plus product. Mechanism As inhibitor binds, the amount of ES complex is reduced. This reduction in the effective concentration of the ES complex can be explained by the fact that having the inhibitor bound to the ES complex essentially converts it to ESI complex, which is considered a separate complex altogether. This reduction in ES complex decreases the maximum enzyme activity (Vmax), as it takes longer for the substrate or product to leave the active site. The reduction in Km \\\\- the substrate concentration at which the enzyme can operate at half of its maximal velocity, often used to approximate an enzyme's affinity for a substrate - can also be linked back to the decrease in ES complex. Le Chatelier's principle opposes this decrease and attempts to make up for the loss of ES, so more free enzyme is converted to the ES form, and the amount of ES increases overall. An increase in ES generally indicates that the enzyme has a high degree of affinity for its substrate. Km decreases as affinity for a substrate increases, though it is not a perfect predictor of affinity since it accounts for other factors as well; regardless, this increase in affinity will be accompanied by a decrease in Km. In general, uncompetitive inhibition works best when substrate concentration is high. An uncompetitive inhibitor need not resemble the substrate of the reaction it is inhibiting. At no concentration of substrate will the activity of the enzyme be higher when an uncompetitive inhibitor is present, but at low concentrations of substrate the enzyme activity difference will be negligible. Mathematical definition Lineweaver‚ÄìBurk plot of uncompetitive enzyme inhibition. The Lineweaver‚ÄìBurk equation states that: :\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{v}=\\\\frac{K_m}{V_{max}[S]} + {1 \\\\over V_\\\\max} Where v is the initial reaction velocity, Km is the Michaelis‚ÄìMenten constant, Vmax is the maximum reaction velocity, and [S] is the concentration of the substrate. The Lineweaver‚ÄìBurk plot for an uncompetitive inhibitor produces a line parallel to the original enzyme-substrate plot, but with a higher y-intercept, due to the presence of an inhibition term \\\\ \\\\frac{[I]}{K_i} : :\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{v}=\\\\frac{K_m}{V_{max}[S]}+\\\\frac{1+\\\\frac{[I]}{K_i}}{V_{max}} Where [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor and Ki is an inhibition constant characteristic of the inhibitor. The Michaelis-Menten equation is altered to: :\\\\ {V_0}=\\\\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m+\\\\alpha'[S]} where :\\\\ \\\\alpha'=1+\\\\frac{[I]}{K'_I} and \\\\ K'_I=\\\\frac{[ES][I]}{[ESI]} As described by the equation above, at high concentrations of substrate, V0 approaches Vmax/Œ±'. Thus, an uncompetitive inhibitor lowers the measured Vmax. Apparent Km also decreases, because [S] required to reach one-half Vmax decreases by the factor Œ±'. It is important to note that Vmax and Km decrease at the same rate as a result of the inhibitor. This is apparent when viewing a Lineweaver-Burk plot of uncompetitive enzyme inhibition: the ratio between V and Km remains the same with or without an inhibitor present.  Implications and uses in biological systems  The unique traits of uncompetitive inhibition lead to a variety of implications for the inhibition's effects within biological and biochemical systems. Uncompetitive inhibition is present within biological systems in a number of ways. In fact, it often becomes clear that the traits of inhibition specific to uncompetitive inhibitors, such as their tendency to act at their best at high concentrations of substrate, are essential to some important bodily functions operating properly. = Involvement in cancer mechanisms = Uncompetitive mechanisms are involved with certain types of cancer. Human alkaline phosphatases such as CGAP have been found to be over-expressed in certain types of cancers, and those phosphotases often operate via uncompetitive inhibition. It has also been found that a number of the genes that code for human alkaline phosphatases (TSAPs) are inhibited uncompetitively by amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine. Studies of the involved amino acid residues have been undertaken in attempts to regulate alkaline phosphatase activity and learn more about said activity's relevance to cancer. Additionally, uncompetitive inhibition works alongside TP53 to help repress the activity of cancer cells and prevent tumorigenesis in certain forms of the illness, as it inhibits G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme primarily involved in certain metabolic pathways). One of the side roles G6PD is responsible for is helping to regulate is the control of reactive oxygen levels, as reactive oxygen species must be kept at appropriate levels to allow cells to survive. When G6PD's substrate concentration is high, uncompetitive inhibition of the enzyme becomes far more effective. As substrate concentration increases, the amount of ES complex increases as well, and with more ES complex to bind, uncompetitive inhibitors become far more active. This inhibition works such that the higher the concentration of substrate is in the system initially, the harder it is to reach the maximum velocity of the reaction. At low initial substrate concentrations, increasing the concentration of substrate is sometimes enough to entirely or even fully restore the enzyme's function, but as soon as initial concentration increases past a certain point, reaching the maximal enzyme velocity is all but impossible. This extreme sensitivity to substrate concentration within the cancer mechanism implicates uncompetitive inhibition rather than mixed inhibition, which displays similar traits but is often less sensitive to substrate concentration due to some inhibitor binding to free enzymes regardless of the substrate's presence. As such, the extreme strength of uncompetitive inhibitors at high substrate concentrations and the overall sensitivity to substrate amount indicates that only uncompetitive inhibition can make this type of process possible. = Importance in cell and organelle membranes = Although this form of inhibition is present in various diseases within biological systems, it does not necessarily only relate to pathologies. It can be involved in typical bodily functions. For example, active sites capable of uncompetitive inhibition appear to be present in membranes, as removing lipids from cell membranes and making active sites more accessible through conformational changes has been shown to invoke elements resembling the effects of uncompetitive inhibition (i.e. both KM and VMax decrease). In mitochondrial membrane lipids specifically, removing lipids decreases the alpha-helix content in mitochondria and leads to changes in ATPase resembling uncompetitive inhibition. This presence of uncompetitive enzymes in membranes has also been supported in a number of other studies. A type of protein called an Arf protein involved in regulating membrane activity was being studied, and it was found that an inhibitor called BFA trapped one of Arf's intermediates via uncompetitive inhibition. This made it clear that this type of inhibition exists within various types of cells and organelles as opposed to just in pathological cells. In fact, BFA was found to relate to the activity of the Golgi apparatus and its role in regulating movement across the cell membrane. = Presence in the cerebellar granule layer = NMDA Inhibitor Memantine leftUncompetitive inhibition can play roles in various other parts of the body as well. It is part of the mechanism by which NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptors are inhibited in the brain, for example. Specifically, this type of inhibition impacts the granule cells that make up a layer of the cerebellum. These cells have the aforementioned NMDA receptors, and the activity of said receptors typically increases as ethanol is consumed. This often leads to withdrawal symptoms if said ethanol is removed. Various uncompetitive blockers act as antagonists at the receptors and modify the process, with one example being an inhibitor called memantine. In fact, in similar cases (involving over-expression of NMDA, though not necessarily via ethanol), it has been shown that uncompetitive inhibition helps in nullifying the over-expression due to its particular properties. Since uncompetitive inhibitors block high concentrations of substrates very efficiently, their traits alongside the innate characteristics of the receptors themselves lead to very effective blocking of NMDA channels when they are excessively open due to massive amounts of NMDA agonists.

The cards tell the story of dinosaurs transported through time into the present day through a freak accident and wreaking havoc on Earth. The series is notable for its graphic violence and gore, intended to evoke memories of the successful Mars Attacks trading card series of 1962.  Overview  The Dinosaurs Attack! trading cards were created as a follow-up to the successful trading card series, Mars Attacks. Like Mars Attacks, Dinosaurs Attack! was intended as an homage and a parody of 1950s B-movies. While Mars Attacks was a parody of alien invasion movies, Dinosaurs Attack! was inspired by monster-on-the-loose movies such as The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla. Topps veteran product developers Art Spiegelman, Len Brown (who had designed and written Mars Attacks) and Gary Gerani developed the idea for the series. Gerani sketched out the 55 card storyboard and wrote the copy for the card backs. Herb Trimpe adapted these into pencils, with some assistance from John Nemec and George Evans. Then Earl Norem and XNO delivered the final paintings. Paul Mavrides and Harry S. Robbins did the artwork for the 11 stickers.Dinosaurs Attack! comic book by IDW, issue #2, 2013. The storyline of the card series is minimal. They tell the story of a scientific time travel experiment gone horribly wrong, transporting dinosaurs of many varieties from their prehistoric world to modern times, where they wreak havoc upon mankind. Most of the cards show a different scene of the dinosaurs causing chaos and death across the world. Some of the cards show the scientists working to reverse the time-travel effect. In the end, the Supreme Monstrosity, patron deity of the dinosaurs (nicknamed \\"Dinosaur Satan\\" by some fans due to its resemblance to the popular culture depiction of Satan) intervenes, trying to stop the scientists. The lead scientist, Elias Thorne, sacrifices himself to the Supreme Monstrosity so his wife, Helen, can succeed and send the dinosaurs back to their own time, tearing the animals apart in the process. The artwork is intended to be shocking and graphically bloody, with one card showing schoolchildren being eaten by an Allosaurus, a Stegosaurus devouring a police officer while its spiked tail gouges out the eye of another and a Pteranodon tearing apart the President of the United States. The cards also contain gross inaccuracies in their depiction of dinosaurs. For instance, in one card, trilobites are portrayed as \\"flesh-eating worms\\" that attack humans. In reality, trilobites consumed mud for nutrients. Also, a Dimetrodon is depicted as dwarfing St. Basil's Cathedral, several herbivores are depicted as flesh-eaters and other various dinosaurs are depicted as being almost kaiju-like. In fact, one can see references to Gorgo, Reptilicus and the Rhedosaurus among the depicted creatures. Trachodon is the exception; it is correctly portrayed as a plant eater and is never seen directly causing any deaths (it does, however, indirectly cause a death when startling one man on a hunting trip so badly that he shoots another by accident). Additionally, it is the only one on the 11 stickers shown not killing a human (instead, it is trying to eat a streetlight). Despite the company's hopes, Dinosaurs Attack! did not achieve commercial success. Tim Burton was planning on making a movie version, but dismissed it when Jurassic Park was released. Instead he made Mars Attacks! Eclipse Comics intended to release a three-part miniseries based on the cards, but ended up only releasing the first issue. This comic book also included four Dinosaurs Attack! bonus cards that had never been seen before and have not been reprinted since. In July 2013, IDW Publishing, as part of the series' 25th anniversary, reprinted the one issue of the Eclipse comic and finished the story as a five-part miniseries. In February 2014, the entire miniseries was reprinted as a trade paperback. The miniseries reunited writer Gary Gerani, penciler Herb Trimpe and painter Earl Norem from the original trading card series. In 2016, Topps and Kickstarter released Mars Attacks: Occupation, an all-new trading card series that contained a subset (one of six) of nine cards (this one, and three others, had this number; the other two had 13 cards in one and 18 cards in the other) called \\"Dinosaurs Attack! vs. Mars Attacks\\". This is the first time that the two famous trading card series' storylines have ever been combined. In 2019, the collectible cards were discussed on two episodes of the popular podcast Hello Internet.  Characters  Throughout the cards, a small number of recurring characters were present, usually appearing as a name or a picture on a few of the cards. * Elias Thorne - One of the head scientists on the TimeScanner project, he and his wife Helen were (presumably) the last humans on the space station Prometheus. While attempting to reverse the TimeScanner's ability to materialize dinosaurs on Earth, they were attacked by a large 'demon' dinosaur. Thorne sacrificed himself to the beast, giving his wife time to start the reverse on the Timescanner, sucking the dinosaurs back to where they came from and ripping them to pieces as they go. * Helen Thorne - The wife of Elias Thorne, she helped him build a mechanism to reverse the TimeScanner's effects. However, a large demon-like dinosaur attacked and killed Elias. Helen was able to throw the switch to the mechanism, triggering the reversal of the TimeScanner, sucking the dinosaurs back to the past and killing them. Helen narrates the back of the final story card, telling that how she and Elias only wanted to know what killed the dinosaurs. She concludes that the reason the dinosaurs were wiped out was because of us. * The Anchorman - This unnamed anchorman appeared on the back of several cards, interviewing attack survivors. He first appeared interviewing a group of rock stars who were attacked by a group of dinosaurs who ate their colorful hair. He later interviewed a man who accidentally shot his friend while fishing, after being startled by a grazing Trachodon. The anchorman is later killed on another card when a dinosaur invades the newsroom and eats him, while his assistant runs off. Throughout his first appearances, the anchorman seemed skeptical of the events. * Mitchell Stevens - The Lt. Colonel in the U.S. Army, he is never actually seen on any of the cards. Rather, he appears on the back of all the cards that look like a report being addressed to the military, with Stevens being the sender. * General Frank Manchester - General Frank Manchester was put in charge of U.S. Army operations after the death of the previous commander, who is ripped in two by a pair of dinosaurs (according to the front of the card in which Manchester first appears). While Manchester is only mentioned on the back of one card, he is later seen on another card crushed by a theropod, his entrails strewn on the ground around him. It is affirmed this is him by Mitchell Stevens' report on the other side of the card. * The Saurian - An evolved, benevolent dinosauroid who appears to Elias in a dream. Despite appearing only once, the Saurian is an important character in the cards; he explains that the dinosaurs' god is the one whom Elias saw through the TimeScan three weeks before and that the deity will not rest until the dinosaurs have flooded over into the present. The Saurian further elaborates that human beings possess souls‚Äîthe ability to judge what is right and wrong‚Äîwhile the dinosaurs do not. This is the cause of the dinosaurs' ferocious, mindless savagery. * The Supreme Monstrosity - The patron deity of the dinosaurs and the main antagonist. He is a devil-like dinosaur who was brought through the TimeScan by Elias and Helen, after which he then decided that the dinosaurs should rule the present and set them on the human race. He was eventually killed when Elias sacrificed himself so Helen could reverse the TimeScan to kill both him and the dinosaurs.

Biography Salisbury was born at Spring Prairie, Wisconsin in 1858. He studied at Whitewater State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, graduating in 1877 after completing the four-year course in just two-and-one-half years. He taught in a village school in Port Washington, Wisconsin, for one year before entering Beloit College as a sophomore in the fall of 1878. At Beloit, he studied geology with T.C. Chamberlin as his professor. After graduating from Beloit in 1881, he spent one year working for the U.S. Geological Survey as Chamberlin's field assistant, during which time he lived in the Chamberlin household. After Chamberlin left Beloit in 1882, Salisbury joined the college faculty, becoming an assistant professor in 1882 and full professor and chair of the geology department in 1884, remaining there for several years.Allan F. Schneider (2001), Chamberlin, Salisbury, and Collie: A Tale of Three Beloit College Geologists, Geoscience Wisconsin vol. 18, pp. 9-20. In 1892 he was one of the scholars on the Peary Relief Expedition to Greenland. After working at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for one year, he was called to the University of Chicago in 1892. At Chicago he became dean of the Ogden Graduate School of Science in 1899, a position he held at the time of his death in 1922. He also organized the university's department of geography in 1903, heading it until 1918. He also served as assistant geologist and geologist for the United States Geological Survey government from 1882 onwards.

Murrow Memorial Bridge (Interstate 90) along Lake Washington and inland to 31st Avenue S. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020, alongside the adjacent Mount Baker Park. History In 1881 the Town Council authorized the first \\"municipal\\" water company which took over a maze of privately owned systems and was authorized to charge for water service. Appropriately named \\"The Spring Hill Water Co.\\", the needs of a growing town were served by building a pumping plant \\"all the way over here\\" on Lake Washington; the year was 1886 and the pump was steam operated. Failure of the main pump brought the designing engineers from the East, who were unable to find the difficulty. A Seattle engineer, James M. Colman, went to work and 36 hours (non-stop) later he had the pump back in service. This pump station worked \\"to heartbreak\\" during the Great Fire of Seattle in 1889. Swimming in Lake Washington at Colman Park, Seattle, Washington, U.S. in 1950. In 1907, the Park Board was given jurisdiction of the plant site plus part of the pipeline right-of-way up the hill. Following the route chosen by the Olmsted Brothers, Frink Boulevard was extended southward curving down the slope, joining Lake Washington Boulevard, coming up from the south along the lakeshore. Additional gifts plus the purchase of property along the north side widened the park, and in 1909 the State granted the shorelands for park purposes. In 1910 the James M. Colman Estate filed a plat in which the \\"head\\" of the slope was deeded for park purposes and the \\"strip\\" from 31st down to the lake was named to the memory of Mr. Colman In August 2002, Joseph Jerome Farris, a Senior Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, had 120 mature bigleaf maple and indigenous cherry trees in Colman Park cut down to improve the view of Lake Washington from his house. Some of the trees were more than forty years old and over fifty-five feet tall. Norm Maleng, the King County Prosecuting Attorney, declined to file felony malicious mischief charges. The Seattle City Attorney fined Judge Farris $500,000. After Judge Farris did not pay the fine on time the city placed a lien on his 8,000 square-foot Mount Baker house. The federal judge maintained the trees were cut down due to a miscommunication with his Vietnamese gardener, which the gardener denied. A jury heard testimony from the gardener when Judge Farris sued his homeowner's insurer for coverage of the fine. Believing the gardener, the jury found against Judge Farris. Judge Farris finally paid the full fine amount, now with interest $618,000, in May 2006.

They joined the Midland League in 1971. They reached the Second Round of the FA Vase three times. In the summer of 2012 the club resigned from the Central Midlands League South Division and folded. Their last manager was ex-pro Paul Rawden. History There are records of a team named Kimberley Town from the late 19th century playing in the FA Cup between 1892 and 1908. However, the forerunner to the club, Kimberley YMCA, were first reported of in 1915 when they won the Notts Intermediate Cup. The club disbanded in 1928, but reformed with the purpose of playing friendlies in 1947. In the 1950s Kimberley YMCA joined the Notts Amateur League, winning the division's Senior Knockout Cup in 1954 before becoming league champions the following season. This led to promotion to Central Alliance League Division Two. A year later the club changed name to Kimberley Town.

He was presented the National Humanities Medal at the White House in 2005 for his contributions to American History, the study of President Abraham Lincoln and monetary policy. He was a member of the Advisory Committee of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission and the Lincoln Forum. Lehrman authored Lincoln at Peoria: The Turning Point, (2008), Lincoln \\"by littles\\" (2013). Churchill, Roosevelt & Company (2017) and Lincoln & Churchill: Statesmen at War (2018). His works on monetary policy include True Gold Standard, Newly Revised and Enlarged, Second Edition (2012) and Money, Gold, and History (2013) as well as co-authoring Money and the Coming World Order (1976) and The Case for Gold (1982). He has written for major news publications such as the Washington Post, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and has lectured widely on American history and economics. Lehrman also writes for the Lincoln Institute which has created award-winning websites on the 16th President. Lehrman achieved national political prominence in a 1982 campaign for Governor of New York, in which he ran against Democratic candidate Mario Cuomo, losing the election by only two percentage points. He is a senior partner at L. E. Lehrman & Co., an investment firm he established in 1981. He is also the chairman of the Lehrman Institute, a public policy research and grant making foundation founded in 1972. He and Richard Gilder were awarded the National Humanities Medal in an Oval Office ceremony on Thursday, November 10, 2005. The Medal was presented by President George W. Bush. He converted to Catholicism. Early life and education Lehrman was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the son of Rose (Herman) and Benjamin Sachs Lehrman, who was chairman of the Rite-Aid Corporation.https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/23/obituaries/brite- aiddrugstorechain.html He is a former President of Rite Aid, a writer, businessman and an economic historian. Washington political columnists Evans and Novak reported that Ronald Reagan considered naming him Secretary of the Treasury before selecting Donald T. Regan. In his memoirs, Regan wrote that he was urged to \\"placate my critics by appointing Lewis Lehrman, a prominent New York conservative, as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.\\" Regan did not want to do so, writing: \\"Although Lehrman was a capable, even a brilliant, man, I declined. I knew that he and I would clash because he would not be content to take a backseat. I wanted an administrator, not a person with policy objectives of his own.\\" Lehrman was also considered for the post of Treasury Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs. Secretary Regan preferred monetarist Beryl Wayne Sprinkel. Unlike Sprinkel, Lehrman was critical of the floating exchange rate policies of Milton Friedman, the leading academic monetarist. Treasury Secretary Regan said he sought \\"the best monetarist I can get.\\" Career Lehrman had written several memos for President-elect Reagan on monetary and fiscal policy‚Äîincluding one entitled \\"The Struggle for Financial Order at the Onset of the Reagan Presidency.\\" Another, co-authored by Congressmen David Stockman and Jack Kemp, was entitled: \\"Avoiding a GOP Economic Dunkirk.\\" Conservative columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak wrote that \\"Stockman had been deeply impressed by Lehrman's arguments and used them as the inspiration for his own more specific paper.\\" Writing of the Lehrman memos, New York Times columnist Leonard Silk warned that if Lehrman was named to a Reagan Administration post, \\"this will point the direction in which the Reagan administration economic policy is moving. But it is not yet there and there is strong opposition among more traditional conservatives.\\" With bank interest rates over 20 percent and annualized inflation rates approaching 15 percent, the economic emergency which Lehrman had first proposed and which had been subsequently endorsed by Stockman and Kemp was ultimately rejected. Rite Aid Corporation was an outgrowth of a family wholesale grocery business in central Pennsylvania, Louis Lehrman & Son, founded by Lehrman's grandfather Louis and expanded by his father Benjamin.Form S-1 Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, Rite Aid Corporation, filed April 26, 1968. On holidays as a teenager, Lehrman began part-time at the firm. He later worked summers and holidays at the company while continuing his education at Yale and Harvard before enlisting in the Army Reserves. In 1962 in Pennsylvania, the company began opening health and beauty stores; it was then a small-town competitor for both customers and store leases. Lehrman joined the company full-time in 1964‚Äîthe same year the first Rite Aid pharmacy was opened in New York State. \\"Lehrman was forced to go from town to town, looking for older stores in downtown areas where landlords were more desperate for tenants, even unknowns,\\" reported the New York Times. \\"Having found a site, he and his partners would devote a Saturday in painting and remodeling (usually spending less than $10,000) and a Sunday to stocking shelves. On Monday, the store would be open for business.\\" Rite Aid went public in a successful 1968 stock offering and continued expansion. At the time, with 32 percent of the company's stock, Lewis Lehrman was the company's president and largest stockholder.Form S-1 Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, Rite Aid Corporation, filed April 26, 1968. Alex Grass, Lehrman's brother-in-law brought into the business by Lehrman's father, was eventually named chief executive. Lehrman stepped down as Rite Aid president in 1977 and as chairman of the firm's executive committee in 1981, eventually severing all ties with the company. His role in what Lehrman called \\"help[ing] to build Rite Aid\\" became a political issue in Lehrman's 1982 New York State gubernatorial campaign when Grass, who was then the company's chairman and CEO, took issue with published articles that gave credit to Lehrman for the company's growth. New York Magazine's Michael Kramer interviewed Grass for a profile on Lehrman. Lehrman \\"wasn't the founder. I was,\\" said Grass. After quoting Grass's version of the founding of Rite Aid, Kramer wrote: \\"Grass of course, is denigrating Lehrman, and as for the facts, they aren't facts at all, or at least they are disputed facts. They are disputed by a host of former and present Rite Aid officers and directors with whom I spoke.\\" Kramer went on to quote other Rite Aid officers and directors. Lehrman \\"took a sleepy little company and breathed life into it,\\" said one company director. Maxwell Rabb, a Rite Aid director and former ambassador to Italy, declared: \\"Lew's role was at least the equal of anyone else's.\\" Lehrman was also a managing director of Morgan Stanley in the late 1980s. After Morgan Stanley, in 1991, he established an investment company, L.E. Lehrman & Co. He was also an investor in George W. Bush's Arbusto Energy. Gubernatorial campaign Lehrman was the president of Rite Aid until 1977 and resigned all positions in 1981 to run for governor of New York the following year. He said that \\"elective office is the only way to get things done.\\" He was well known for wearing red suspenders in his campaign commercials. On June 16, 1982 Lehrman was chosen as the official GOP designee for governorship, getting \\"68.88 percent of the weighted votes at a hectic meeting of the Republican State Committee in Manhattan.\\" He would later win the primary and become the Republican candidate for governor. Popular historian Samuel G. Freedman wrote that \\"Lehrman's goals, the party went far beyond solvency or an orderly transfer of power. What was needed was a populist uprising with a manifesto to match. Lehrman planned to create both the same way he had created the Rite-Aid network, by driving to cities and towns and paying attention to Main Street.\\" The Republican gubernatorial candidate came into conflict with some top Republican members of the legislature over his tax reduction program. Asked about their differences in the final \\"Inside Albany\\" debate, Lehrman said, \\"I've put this issue to the voters. I'm not putting it to the legislators. Who rules New York State, 211 legislators or 18 million free people? That's the question. Who rules the government of the State of New York? Is it owned and operated by the politicians and the bureaucrats, or is it owned for the purpose of benefiting the 18 million people who live here? That's the issue.\\" Running on the lines of the Republican and Conservative Parties, Lehrman was defeated by then-Lieutenant Governor Mario Cuomo, 51‚Äì48%. Cuomo ran on the lines of the Democratic and Liberal Parties, after defeating New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch in the Democratic Party primary election. Lehrman won the Republican nomination in a primary against attorney Paul J. Curran after several other Republican candidates dropped out of the race. Political scientists Peter W. Colby and John K. White noted a sharp upstate-downstate split in the race, with Cuomo carrying a 575,000-vote advantage in New York City. \\"Lehrman carried the rest of the state by 400,000 votes\\" and won \\"fifty- two of the fifty-seven upstate counties.\\" The debates between the two gubernatorial candidates were sharp exchanges on issues involving the state's economic and crime problems. The public encounters of Mario M. Cuomo and Lewis E. Lehrman in the closing weeks of the 1982 gubernatorial campaign produced a substantive, often lively, at times intense, but consistently civil exchange of ideas,\\" recalled E. J. Mahon, who covered the race as a journalist. The New York Times reported after the New York Post debate at the beginning of October, \\"Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Lewis E. Lehrman argued virtually uninterrupted for 50 minutes yesterday in their first debate of the New York gubernatorial campaign. What were to have been two-minute opening statements stretched to 25 minutes as the two‚Äîintense but seemingly not angry‚Äîalternated ripostes and kept their own informal time limits. At one point, Mr. Cuomo gestured to the four panelists and said, 'Maybe we should let them play.'\\" High national and state unemployment hurt Lehrman's campaign. \\"The general election campaign for governor was billed as a 'referendum on Reaganomics.\\" However, if the election had been a referendum on Reaganomics and unemployment, Cuomo would have won by a margin reflecting his party's enormous voter-registration edge and allowing room for a few disgruntled Republicans and Independents as well, according to a Princeton University thesis on the gubernatorial campaign. \\"Instead, Lew Lehrman was able to use technologies such as television and direct mail to campaign 'offensively' on issues which were more favorable for him such as the death penalty, crime, welfare fraud, prayer in schools, and unpopular record of the [Hugh] Carey Administration. Moreover, he was able to blunt the Reaganomics issue by widely publicizing an economic plan of his own.\\" Lehrman himself was critical of the national Republican strategy in the election at a time when U.S. unemployment was over 10 percent: \\"I believe the Reagan Administration should be making a major effort to show clearly how we are going to rebuild the economy and create 20 million jobs in the next 10 years,\\" he told the New York Times. He added: \\"A slogan like 'Stay the Course' is inadequate.\\" At the time, the size of Lehrman's commercial advertising was virtually unprecedented. The Christian Science Monitor reported late in the campaign: \\"The ads have aired so frequently that the New Yorker magazine ran a cartoon showing a parrot next to a television set. The parrot says, 'I'm Lew Lehrman. Lew Lehrman for governor!...' The barrage of television ads have effectively turned Lewis Lehrman into a household term. In his Borough Park, Brooklyn, campaign swing here recently, one youngster shouted, 'There's the man on TV!'\\" Cuomo sought to make Lehrman's spending a campaign issue. Lehrman \\"was a clean slate upon which any image could be drawn through television and radio ads,\\" wrote Cuomo in the Diaries of Mario M. Cuomo. \\"The polls indicated that neither the gold standard nor Reaganomics would enhance the image‚Äîthe public knew little of the former and New York State was suffering severely from the Reagan Recession and budget cuts‚Äîso these issues were ignored. Instead, television ads‚Äîfour or five million dollars' worth to begin‚Äîdepicted Lehrman as a genial family man who knew how to produce jobs‚Äîhis successful business career was proof‚Äîand stop crime‚Äîwith capital punishment.\\" In his diary, Cuomo complained about Lehrman's high spending on direct mail and television advertising, but admitted in late October 1982: \\"A strange problem has developed. We have more than we can spend‚Äîmuch more!\\" Cuomo won, and would go on to serve three terms as governor before he was defeated for re-election in 1994. American history Lehrman attended The Hill School, a boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. Lehrman's involvement with the teaching of history began as a Carnegie Teaching Fellow at Yale University in 1960 and subsequently at Harvard University, where he completed a master's degree as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. In the 1970s he returned to Yale to head up a review of the humanities curriculum for the Yale University Council. For the Gilder Lehrman Collection, Lewis Lehrman and Richard Gilder collected historical documents in order to place them into a collection where they would be available to scholars and the public. First put on deposit at the Morgan Library, the Gilder Lehrman Collection is now on deposit at the New-York Historical Society. By 2006, the GLC had amassed more than 60,000 documents and other historical items, mostly on 18th and 19th Century America. Articles from those periods have been used in exhibits at George Washington's Mount Vernon, Gettysburg, the Morgan Library and the New-York Historical Society. Lehrman himself has written and lectured about Abraham Lincoln's legacy in the centrality of American history. In 1972, Lehrman founded the Lehrman Institute, a public policy think tank in New York City which focused on the study of economic and foreign policy from a historical perspective. Lehrman and investor-philanthropist Richard Gilder, both former students at Yale University and members of Wolf's Head Society, went on to found the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History and the Gilder Lehrman Collection of American historical documents in 1994. Lehrman has said that \\"the building of the collection was to get... documents... out of private hands and into a place where they could be serving American students [and] American teachers.\\" They also founded the Lincoln and Soldiers Institute at Gettysburg College, which awards the Lincoln Prize \\"annually for the finest scholarly work in English on Abraham Lincoln, the American Civil War soldier, or a subject relating to their era\\", as well as the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance and Abolition at Yale University, which awards the Frederick Douglass Prize for the best work in these fields. \\"Over the last two generations our public and private schools have been eliminating civics classes and replacing the study of American history with social studies classes,\\" Lehrman said in a newspaper interview. \\"In many American colleges today you can graduate with a degree without ever taking a full course in American history. I respect the fact that this is a free country... but I do not regard the ignorance of American history as a good thing.\\" In a 2008 interview with Humanities magazine, Lehrman described the efforts he had begun with Gilder: \\"[W]e want history to be a public thing. Which is why Dick and I, working with Gabor Boritt, established the Lincoln Prize for the very best work on the era of Mr. Lincoln and the Civil War and, with David Davis, the Frederick Douglass Book Prize for the very best work on abolition, resistance, and slavery. We want to help attract the interest of the general public. And scholars and teachers should be honored for the immense effort they make to write and to study and to teach American history.\\" The first prize was \\"announced on Feb. 12, 1991, the 182d anniversary of Lincoln's birth, with subsequent prizes announced every year on his birthday eve, Feb. 11.\\" The first Lincoln Prize recipient was film-maker Ken Burns for his Civil War series on PBS. Subsequent winners have included historians Michael Burlingame, Richard J. Carwardine, David H. Donald, Eric Foner, John Hope Franklin, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Allen C. Guelzo, James McPherson, James Oakes, and Douglas L. Wilson. Because of their conservative credentials, the support of Lehrman and Gilder for history projects was sometimes controversial. In 2005, David Brion Davis, a self-described \\"leftish Democrat\\" who worked with them on the Yale University's Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition defended them: \\"Despite our major political differences, I have never encountered even the most subtle attempt at ideological influence of any kind with respect to my teaching, writing, cocurating a national exhibition on slavery, or making proposals as a member of the Advisory Board of the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History.\\" In 2013, Lehrman published The American Founders, a collection of essays on the military and civilian leaders of the Revolutionary War era. Recently, in 2017 and 2018, Lehrman published Churchill, Roosevelt & Company: Studies in Character and Statecraft a book that examines the \\"special relationship\\" between the United States and Great Britain cemented the alliance that won the war, and Lincoln & Churchill: Statesmen at War a discourse about how Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, as commanders in chief, led their nations to victory. Abraham Lincoln Lehrman founded the Lincoln Institute to provide support and assistance to scholars and groups involved in the study of the life of America's 16th President. 'The Lincoln Institute promotes the development and dissemination of printed materials, broadcast products, conferences and Internet resources on Mr. Lincoln. It encourages scholars to cooperate with one another and to contribute to the development of historical materials and the transcription of primary sources for both physical and virtual display. The Institute also produces and maintains six websites about Abraham Lincoln and the people with whom he lived and worked. In 2013, Lehrman published Lincoln \\"by littles,\\" a collection of his essays on Lincoln and the Civil War. Conservative causes President George W. Bush, First Lady Laura Bush, and Richard Gilder in 2005 Lehrman is active in civic and conservative causes. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Project for the New American Century for one year. In the late 1970s he was a Trustee to the American Enterprise Institute and was an early trustee of the Heritage Foundation until the 1990s. He was an early trustee of the Manhattan Institute and a trustee of the Pierpont Morgan Library. In 1983, he helped to found Citizens for America, an organization which aided Oliver North's campaign to supply the anti-communist Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua. The impetus for the organization came from Jaquelin H. Hume, a friend of President Ronald Reagan, had conceived the project and sold President Reagan on getting Lehrman involved. Reagan called Lehrman: \\"The President and I had a long talk. The conclusions of our discussion were very simple. We agree we needed a national civil league, an activist enterprise, people who agreed on first principles, that would focus on economic and national security policies. Our first purpose is to induce a mutation in the climate of opinion in American among opinion leaders. We would join the intellectual debate in every town, village, and city through our Congressional district committees.\\" In his diary, Reagan wrote: \\"Lew Lehrman & Jack Hume came by. They have a great plan for getting our supporters organized at the Cong. District level.\\" At the time, Lehrman was considered a possible future Republican presidential candidate. In 1985, the organization was run for a short time by future lobbyist and convict Jack Abramoff. Abramoff was later fired for mismanaging the organization's funds.Hemingway, Mark. \\"My Dinner With Jack\\" The Weekly Standard, April 3, 2006. During that year, Citizens for America sponsored a meeting in Angola between Angolan, Nicaraguan, Afghan, and Laotian anti-communist rebels. Lehrman personally attended the event, called the \\"Democratic International\\". Lehrman stepped down from Citizens for America in September 1986 and was succeeded by Gerald P. Carmen, former ambassador to Switzerland. =Position on the gold standard= From very early on, Lewis E. Lehrman \\"became a big fan of Jacques Rueff, Charles de Gaulle's finance minister, and a true believer in the gold standard.\\" Lehrman was a member of the U.S. Gold Commission in 1981 with Congressman Ron Paul. In 1982, they co-authored the book The Case for Gold with a team of economists that included Murray Rothbard. Lehrman's singular point of view appears in many periodicals including The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, National Review, American Spectator and The Weekly Standard. Additionally, Lehrman contributed to Money and the Coming World Order, originally published by the New York University Press and republished by The Lehrman Institute in 2012, and wrote The True Gold Standard (2012). In promoting a return to the Gold Standard, Lehrman was allied to James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, with whom he testified before the United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology in March 2011 and September 2012. Lehrman launched the Gold Standard Now in 2011 as an aggregator of monetary policy news and to advocate that \\"America should lead by unilateral resumption of the gold standard.\\" In 2013, Lehrman published Money, Gold and History, a collection of his writings on monetary policy and his advocacy of the gold standard. One commentator noted that \\"Lehrman is one of a very small group of contemporary gold advocates able to successfully bridge the gap separating practical conservative intellectualism from fleeting, half-baked idealism.\\" Lehrman repeatedly argued that paper currency was injurious to working Americans. \\"The primary argument upon which I would rest my case for a gold standard,\\" Lehrman said in a 2013 interview, \\"is that it preserves the purchasing power, the wages, the salaries, of all those who are unable to defend themselves in the halls of Congress in Washington or elsewhere, in citadels of power like Wall Street.\\" =The Lehrman American Studies Center= In 2005, with Lehrman's funding, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute established the Lehrman American Studies Center.

Category:February in the Eastern Orthodox calendar ","title":"February 3 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)"},{"id":"3942239","text":"Francis Russell Nixon (August 18037 April 1879) was a Britsih Anglish bishop who served as the first Bishop of Tasmania, Australia. Early life and ministry Nixon was the son of Robert Nixon, a priest and amateur painter of North Cray, Kent. Nixon was educated at the Merchant Taylors school and St John's College, Oxford, graduating Bachelor of Arts (BA) and subsequently Oxford Master of Arts (MA) and Doctor of Divinity (DD). He was ordained priest in 1827 (the year of his graduation), becoming chaplain at Naples and afterwards held the perpetual curacies of Sandgate and Sandwich. While addressing a public meeting at Canterbury, his eloquence brought him to the notice of William Howley, Archbishop of Canterbury, who appointed him one of the Six Preachers at Canterbury Cathedral. In September 1840 he preached a sermon in the presence of the archbishop, which was published with notes in the same year. Bishop of Tasmania Nixon's consecration On 24 August 1842, Nixon was consecrated a bishop at Westminster Abbey, to serve as the first Bishop of Tasmania, and arrived in the colony (then still called Van Diemen's Land) in June 1843. His first task was the organisation of the church in Tasmania, and being a moderate high churchman he came into conflict with some clergy of evangelical views. His Lectures, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical on the Catechism of the Church of England, a volume of over 600 pages, was published in London in 1843, and a second edition was called for in the following year. His letters patent declared his jurisdiction \\"spiritual and ecclesiastical throughout the diocese according to the ecclesiastical laws of England\\". Endeavouring to act on his letters of appointment, he came into conflict with the governor, John Eardley-Wilmot, and the Presbyterian and other denominations petitioned Queen Victoria on the subject. Nixon's administration of the Diocese of Tasmania was firm and energetic, and he set a good example to the colonists by devoting a large proportion of his own income to the needs of the church and education. In 1847, he addressed a vigorous communication Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey on the evils of transportation, which was printed by order of the House of Commons in that year. It was also privately printed and issued at Launceston in November 1848. In addition to the works already mentioned Nixon published a short History of Merchant- Taylors' School in 1823, The Cruise of the Beacon, A Narrative of a Visit to the Islands in Bass's Straits (1857), and some charges and sermons. Like his father he practised painting, his sketchbook containing drawings and paintings of Tasmanian scenes is at the Mitchell Library, Sydney. He resigned on account of ill health in March 1863, and was given a valuable living at Bolton Percy, Yorkshire, England; but finding his health would not allow him to give proper attention to his duties he resigned it in 1865, and went to live near Lake Maggiore in Italy. He died at his residence there on 7 April 1879.

According to the other sources he belongs to the Yalxoroj (–Ø–ª—Ö–æ—Ä–æ–π) teip (clan) and is originally from the village of Yalxoroj which is named after this teip. During the Soviet period Geliskhanov served as chief of the traffic police in Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, reaching the rank of colonel. =Chechen security service= Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Chechnya's declaration of independence, after Geliskhanov lost in elections to the post of mayor of Gudermes 1992, in 1993 Dzhokhar Dudayev made him Chechen minister of internal affairs and then director of the State Security Department DGB (–î–ì–ë) later the same year. ¬´–ü—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π¬ª –±–æ–µ–≤–∏–∫, Vremya Novostei, 29.03.2006 His rise was made possible by his friendship with Dudayev's son-in-law, Salman Raduyev. In June 1993, Geliskhanov ordered disarmament of all \\"illegal armed formations\\" and banned civilians from bearing arms in public (a right given to the people by Dudayev earlier).Tracey C. German, Russia's Chechen War, p.100 He then personally led the breaking up of an opposition rally in central Grozny, during which some 15 people were killed; a year later, he directed large-scale arrests of opposition members. Geliskhanov's DGB successes included the arrest the Chechen mafia boss Nikolay Suleimanov and the capture of two high-ranking officers of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK, at the time the main successor agency to the KGB) clandestinely deployed to Chechnya.John B. Dunlop, Russia Confronts Chechnya: Roots of a Separatist Conflict, p.153 Ruslan Labazanov, opposition co-leader, crime kingpin and renegade former head of Dudayev's bodyguards, publicly swore to kill \\"especially Dudayev and Geliskhanov.\\"Special to Moskovskiye Novosti: RUSLAN LABAZANOV, Moskovskiye Novosti, August 1994 There were rumours Geliskhanov told the FSK that he has two battalions ready to confront Dudayev, but he denied having said that.Stephen J. Cimbala, Russia and Armed Persuasion, p.179 He also accused the FSK of spending billion of dollars on terrorism, sabotage, propaganda, disinformation and other subversive actions aimed at toppling the Chechen government.Amy W. Knight, Spies Without Cloaks: The KGB's Successors, p.106 =First war with Russia= At the beginning of the First Chechen War of 1994-1996, Geliskhanov took part in the Battle of Grozny. The DGB unit under his personal command fled their post after being bombed and without notifying the HQ, which allowed a Russian infantry force to cross Voikov bridge across the Sunzha River and approach the City Hospital No.2 (the command center after the evacuation of the Presidential Palace), eventually forcing the Chechen command to abandon it.COLONEL HUSEIN ISKHANOV, Small Wars Journal, June 1999 Having abandoned his official post of the Chechen security minister after he had fled from besieged Chechen capital in late January 1995,Pro-Russian Chechens join battle, The Independent, January 25, 1995 Geliskhanov engaged in negotiations regarding his surrender, but demanded guarantees of safety. On March 14, 1995, however, the acting Russian federal prosecutor of the Chechen Republic Baskhanov signed an order to initiate criminal proceedings against him along with Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, Shamil Basayev and other Chechen leaders.Yndarbiyev killed in Qatar accused of involvement in hostage taking in Dubrovka theatre , Ramzan Kadyrov's official website CHECHNYA FREE.RU, 02/13/2004 Geliskhanov then became a guerrilla leader, gaining reputation as one of the top separatist field commanders.Sebastian Smith, Allah's Mountains: The Battle for Chechnya, p.180 According to Human Rights Watch, Ishkoy-Yurt, a village located directly across the border with Dagestan, was reportedly \\"marked for special retribution\\" by Russian troops on April 20 because it was the home of Geliskhanov, \\"a leading Dudayev loyalist\\".Russia: Partisan War in Chechnya on the Eve of the WWII Commemoration, Human Rights Watch, 1 May 1995 In April‚ÄìMay there were false rumours that he has been \\"liquidated\\" by a covert FSK assassination squad.Chechnya: No Afghanistan, The Moscow Times, 13 April 1995Russian hit squad believed to target Chechen leaders: Pentagon analysts cite April attack, The Washington Times, May 12, 1995 In 1995, along with Raduyev, Geliskhanov commanded an attack on a convoy of the Russian Interior Ministry, and on December 14 the pair led a large-scale guerrilla raid on Gudermes, seizing much of the city for three days.Robert Seely, Russo-Chechen Conflict, 1800-2000: A Deadly Embrace, p.282 He also participated in negotiations with federal representatives during the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in the role of neutral mediator. =After the war= After the end of the first war, and following Aslan Maskhadov's election as President of Ichkeria in January 1997, Geliskhanov again joined up with Raduyev, an opponent of Maskhadov who has raised an unruly 1,000-strong militia known as General Dudayev's Army, based in downtown Grozny and partially controlling the Gudermessky District of eastern Chechnya. Geliskhanov's Squad, his group of about 100 armed men, was based in the remote Nozhay-Yurtovsky District to the south of Gudermessky.CHECHEN CHRONICLES'98, Chapter 4, GlobalSecurity.org, 31.01.2000 =Second war with Russia= When the Second Chechen War began in 1999, his men reportedly dispersed and there were reports that he had died. In April 2002, pro-Moscow President of the Chechen Republic Akhmad Kadyrov claimed that Geliskhanov and more than 100 of his fighters planned to give up soon, but this did not take place.DOUBTS RAISED ABOUT LATEST REBEL ‚ÄúSURRENDER‚Äù, The Jamestown Foundation, North Caucasus Analysis Volume: 7 Issue: 13 =Surrender= On March 28‚Äì29, 2006, regnum.ru and kavkaz.memo.ru reported that Sultan Geliskhanov and his brother Turpal voluntarily surrendered in Gudermes to the pro-Moscow Chechen authorities. According to kavkaz.memo.ru, which quoted an unnamed Chechen law-enforcement official as saying Geliskhanov has been interrogated and released, and the only outstanding charge against Geliskhanov was \\"participation in an illegal armed formation\\", qualifying him for an amnesty. Chechen separatists called Geliskhanov \\"a private person\\" and according to Zakayev, by then an envoy of the separatist president Abdul-Halim Sadulayev, \\"the announced voluntary surrender of a powerful warlord is just an action of propaganda ... Geliskhanov had never fired a shot at federals that war.\\" Geliskhanov himself said he had \\"long ago become disillusioned with the policy of Aslan Maskhadov\\". He also claimed that because of his disagreement with the political course of the separatist leadership he had not taken active part in fighting during both the first and second military campaigns and had remained out of the separatist government during the 1995-1999 inter-war period,Sinless Surrender, Kommersant, March 29, 2006 (Retrieved on March 31, 2007) and said he decided to surrender when Ramzan Kadyrov personally guaranteed safety for the former separatists \\"with no blood on their hands\\".

Her stated artistic objective, as she told an interviewer in 1925, was to ‚Äúlook for beauty in the every-day world, to catch the joy and swing of modern American life.‚Äù  Early years  Bessie Onahotema Potter was born in St Louis, Missouri, the only child of Ohio natives Alexander and Mary McKenney Potter. Her father died in 1874, in an accident, at age 38. By 1877, she and her mother had joined members of her mother's family in Chicago. In school she enjoyed clay-modeling class and decided at an early age that she wanted to be a sculptor. In 1886, at age 14, she enrolled in classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. She was able to afford the tuition only because a local sculptor, Lorado Taft, hired her to work as a studio assistant, on Saturdays. From 1890 to 1891 she studied with Taft at the Art Institute, as she completed its sculptor courses.  Early works  Portrait of Bessie Potter by William Merritt Chase, c. 1895 Vonnoh became one of the so-called \\"White Rabbits\\", women artists including Helen Farnsworth Mears and Janet Scudder who assisted Taft on the sculpture program for the Horticultural Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. She also produced an independent commission, the Personification of Art, for the Illinois State Building of the exposition. In 1895, she traveled to Europe, and met Auguste Rodin. Her best-known statuette, Young Mother (1896), used fellow \\"White Rabbit\\" Margaret Daisy Gerow (Mody) Proctor, wife of sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor, and their infant son as models. In 1898, she received the commission for a bust of General Samuel W. Crawford for the Smith Memorial Arch in Philadelphia.Crawford bust In 1899 she married impressionist painter Robert Vonnoh, at his home in Rockland Lake, New York, and honeymooned in Paris. At the 1900 Exposition Universelle, she was awarded a Bronze Medal for A Young Mother and exhibited another statuette, Girl Dancing. She exhibited at both the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, receiving an honorable mention for A Young Mother, and at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis, Missouri, where she was awarded a Gold Medal for a group of ten works.  Middle years  Bessie Potter Vonnoh in her studio by Jessie Tarbox Beals, c. 1905, silver print, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, Department of Image Collections. Bessie Potter and Robert Vonnoh, c. 1930. In March 1903, the New York Times noted that the Vonnohs were two of a dozen painters and sculptors who got together to create a building specifically for their studios, at 27 West Sixty-Seventh Street in Manhattan. In mid-1903, the Vonnohs began summering in Old Lyme, Connecticut, and became long-time members of its Old Lyme Art Colony. Vonnoh's small-scale works were suited to the size and style of the average American home, and had broad appeal. Many of her works, such as Water lilies, were portraits. Vonnoh's statue Water lilies (1913) was based on the daughter of fellow artists Helen Savier and Frank DuMond at Lyme. Vonnoh stated that she was \\"determined to prove that as perfect a likeness and as much beauty could be produced in statuettes twelve inches in height, and in busts of six inches, as could be had in the life-size and colossal productions suitable for so few houses.\\" In December 1912, the New York Times, writing about her works at the New York Academy of Art, called her figurines \\"lovely\\", of a \\"charming style\\", and said \\"we must applaud once more her skillful harmonizing of detail in the contemporary costume, her selection of the most distinguished line for emphasis.\\" In 1915, Vonnoh exhibited in the Armory Show. In 1921, she was elected an academician of the National Academy of Design. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1931.

In 1937, Vonnoh completed her best-known large-scale work, the Burnett Memorial Fountain in Central Park.Burnett Memorial  Later years  After her first husband's death, Vonnoh produced relatively little. She married again in 1948, to Dr. Edward L. Keyes, Jr., a widower, who died only nine months later. Vonnoh herself died in New York City in 1955, at age 82. She is buried alongside her first husband, Robert Vonnoh (1858 ‚Äì 1933), in the Duck River Cemetery in Old Lyme, Connecticut.

She was a concubine of Emperor Jianwen and the mother of Emperor Xiaowu. Life Li Lingrong was born of a humble origin, and she became a servant girl in the household of Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji. She was one of the servants involved with manufacturing textiles. =Concubine= Sima Yu originally had a wife from high birth‚ÄîPrincess Wang Jianji (ÁéãÁ∞°Âß¨), who bore him his heir apparent Sima Daosheng (Âè∏È¶¨ÈÅìÁîü) and Sima Yusheng (Âè∏È¶¨‰øûÁîü). However, Sima Daosheng was described as careless and frivolous. In 348, while Sima Yu was prime minister for his grandnephew Emperor Mu, Sima Daosheng was accused of unspecified crimes. He was deposed and died in imprisonment. Princess Wang died in distress. Sima Yusheng and three other sons of Sima Yu all died early, leaving him without an heir, and his concubines were not conceiving any more. He retained a magician to look at his concubines to see which one could conceive an heir, and the magician looked at all of them and opined that none was destined to give him an heir‚Äîbut then he saw Li Lingrong, who was tall, dark-skinned and who was derogatorily referred to as an African people, and he, in surprised, yelled out, \\"She is the one!\\" Sima Yu therefore took her as a concubine, and she bore him two sons‚ÄîSima Yao in 362 and Sima Daozi in 363 or 364. Sima Yao was subsequently named heir apparent. She also bore Sima Yu a daughter, who would later be Princess Poyang. =Empress Dowager= In 371, the paramount general Huan Wen, in order to showcase his power, deposed Sima Yu's nephew Emperor Fei and replaced him with Sima Yu (as Emperor Jianwen). Emperor Jianwen ruled only for one year, dying in 372. He did not create her any special titles, but he did create her son Sima Yao crown prince. Sima Yao, after Emperor Jianwen's death, ascended the throne as Emperor Xiaowu. Initially, out of respect for his father's deceased wife Princess Wang, he did not honor Consort Li as empress dowager, but did progressively honor her with greater and greater imperial consort titles. In 387, he honored her as Consort Dowager (ÁöáÂ§™Â¶É), with all ceremonial trappings of an empress dowager. In 394, after a petition by Sima Daozi (by now the Prince of Kuaiji), she was finally honored as empress dowager. Empress Dowager Li's influence during Emperor Xiaowu's reign appeared to be limited, as Emperor Mu's mother Empress Dowager Chu was regent early, and after she gave up regent authorities in 376, power was largely in the hands of Xie An until Emperor Xiaowu fully turned adult. She was described as often mediating conflicts between him and Sima Daozi, and throughout his reign, Sima Daozi had great authority as the emperor's brother and prime minister. =Grand Empress Dowager= Emperor Xiaowu was killed by his concubine Honoured Lady Zhang in 396 after humiliating her. He was succeeded by his developmentally disabled son Emperor An, and Empress Dowager Li was honored as grand empress dowager. She died in 400 and was mourned with ceremony due an empress, but was not buried with Emperor Jianwen or worshipped with him in his temple, but instead was worshipped in the same temple that housed Emperor Jianwen's mother, Consort Zheng Achun (ÈÑ≠ÈòøÊò•).

The parish lies wholly with the South Downs National Park. The parish is located on the north slopes of the South Downs, five miles (8 km) to the north-west of Brighton. The civil parish covers an area of . History Fulking was originally part of the parish of Edburton. The parish was unusual in that part lay in Bramber rape and Burbeach hundred and part in Lewes rape and Poynings hundred (usually parish boundaries followed rape boundaries). The civil parish of Fulking was created from the eastern half of the ancient parish (sometimes referred to as 'the ecclesiastical parish') in 1894, after the creation of the administrative counties of West Sussex (which incorporated Bramber Rape) and East Sussex (which incorporated Lewes Rape) in 1889. The remainder of Edburton was added to Upper Beeding parish in 1933. Fulking transferred from East Sussex to West Sussex with the creation of Mid Sussex District in 1974. Governance=Civil Parish= Fulking Parish Council has five parish councillors. The Parish Council holds an annual meeting (usually in May) and at least three other ordinary meetings a year; additional meetings may be called to discuss planning applications. Meetings are held at Fulking Village Hall. =Non-metropolitan district= Fulking civil parish is in Hurstpierpoint and Downs Ward of the non-metropolitan district of Mid Sussex; the ward returns three councillors to Mid Sussex District Council. The responsibilities of district councils usually include local planning, housing, local highways, building, environmental health, and refuse collection. However, the parish lies wholly with the South Downs National Park. The planning authority for Fulking is therefore the South Downs National Park Authority (SDNPA), the statutory planning authority for the National Park area. =Non-metropolitan county= Fulking civil parish is in the Hurstpierpoint and Bolney electoral division of the non-metropolitan county of West Sussex. The division returns one councillor to West Sussex County Council. The functions of county councils include education, transport, strategic planning, fire services, consumer protection, refuse disposal, social services and libraries. =Westminster Constituency= Fulking civil parish is in the Arundel and South Downs constituency. Landmarks=Listed buildings= Fulking civil parish contains 22 listed buildings. Of these, one is Grade II* and the remaining 21 are Grade II. The Grade II* listed building is: * Perching Manor Farmhouse (List Entry Number 1354845), an L-shaped 18th century house. =Scheduled monuments= The parish contains four scheduled monuments. * Motte-and-bailey castle on Edburton Hill (List Entry Number 1012171), the earthworks and interior area of a castle believed to date from the immediate post-Conquest period, soon after October 1066.Film of the site, 'Sussex Walks: Exploring Edburton Castle in West Sussex', published on Youtube 27 November 2017, Richard Vobes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzMd9w3OMzM * Bowl barrow on Scabes Castle (List Entry Number 1014950), lying on the parish boundary between Fulking and Poynings, an originally circular funerary monument, now a roughly oval mound, having been levelled by modern ploughing on its eastern side. * Bowl barrow on Fulking Hill (List Entry Number 1014951), a circular mound which shows signs of part-excavation in the past. * Deserted medieval settlement and associated cultivation terraces on Perching Hill (List Entry Number 1015125). Downland was rarely inhabited during the medieval period; the establishment of the settlement is probably due to the presence of an underground water course in the coombe, indicated by a well about 60m to the west of the monument. =1886 Water supply system= A distinctive feature of Fulking is the remains of a late Nineteenth Century water supply system. A hydraulic ram, housed in small building near the Shepherd and Dog public house, pumped water from a stream up hill to a reservoir at the western end of the village street, where a drinking fountain and water trough were provided. The water was then fed by gravity to two further reservoirs, supplying two hand pumps along the street. The building housing the hydraulic ram bears the inscription, on ceramic tiles, ‚ÄòHe sendeth springs into the valleys which run among the hills  Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness‚Äô (Psalm 104, verse 10 and Psalm 107, verse 8). It is a Grade II listed building (List Entry Number 1354830). The drinking fountain bears the inscription, on ceramic tiles, ‚ÄòTo the glory of God  And in honour of John Ruskin  Psalm LXXVIII  That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God  But keep his commandments  Who brought streams also out of the rock‚Äô (Psalm 58, verses 7 and 16). The drinking fountain is also listed (List Entry Number 1334374), as are the two associated hand pumps in the village (List Entry Number 1096867 and List Entry Number 1285792). The system was installed in 1886. Henry Willett, a wealthy brewer from Brighton, and John Ruskin are usually credited with devising and instigating the water supply scheme. However, contemporary newspaper accounts give credit for the scheme to Rev. F. Gell, rector to Edburton, with generous support from Henry Willet. Ruskin himself, in a letter to Willet dated Brantwood, 16 June 1887, said ‚ÄòI was grieved by your inscription on the fountain, for it made my name far too conspicuous, nor did I feel that the slightest honour was owing to me in the matter‚Äô. Parish Church As a consequence of its history, Fulking has no parish church of its own. Ecclesiastically, it remains part of the parish of Edburton, and uses St Andrew‚Äôs church, Edburton, as its parish church. The church is part of the Downland Benefice, together with the churches in Poynings, Newtimber and Pyecombe. Sport Fulking is the home of the Preston Nomads Cricket Club. The club was founded in 1927 Preston, Brighton. When it was founded, the club did not have its own ground; hence the ‚ÄòNomads‚Äô element of the name. It played on whatever council-run pitches were available. in 1937, Spenta (Spen) Cama, one of the founding members of the club, bought some fields in Fulking which formed the nucleus of the club‚Äôs current ground. Further land purchases in 1955 and 1991 extended the club‚Äôs grounds to their current size. The club‚Äôs pavilion was opened in 1982. Preston Nomads Cricket Club was a founder member of the Sussex Cricket League in 1971. The club runs four men's Saturday League teams and one on Sundays. The club has a junior section and runs a coaching programme.

The region includes the local government areas of the City of Campbelltown, Camden Council and Wollondilly Shire. It covers an area of 3,067 square kilometres and has a population of close to 310,000 residents. The region geographically forms the foothills between the Blue Mountains and Southern Highlands regions. The region is bounded at the north by Glenfield (45 km south-west of Sydney CBD) and Warragamba (65 km west from the Sydney CBD); at the south by Yanderra (95 km south-west from Sydney CBD) and Buxton; at the east by the town of Appin; and at the west by the hamlet Nattai. Most of the area is taken up by the semi-rural Wollondilly Shire; most of the population lives within the satellite city of Campbelltown and its surrounding suburbs. The region is one of the fastest-growing regions in the Sydney metropolitan area, with many new modern suburbs sprouting up in recent decades such as Glen Alpine, Macquarie Links, Harrington Park, Blair Athol, Mount Annan, Currans Hill, Englorie Park, Picton and Catherine Field  Etymology  The region is named after Elizabeth Macarthur and John Macarthur who were founders and pioneers of the Australian wool industry. Founded on land owned by the Macarthurs and surveyed by Sir Thomas Mitchell, the town of Camden was named for Lord Camden, who, during his brief tenure as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies had secured the initial land grant for John Macarthur who was then in England. The original Macarthur family property covered the three local councils (Camden Council, Campbelltown City Council and Wollondilly Shire) that are within the region.  Geography  The region is generally regarded as the area where the city of Sydney meets rural countryside of regional New South Wales. Campbelltown and Camden were once rural towns which formed the nucleus of new urban communities created following the Three Cities Structure Plan 1973. The Wollondilly Shire which makes up the largest Southern part of the region is a mostly rural region with small scale industry and commerce. Notably, the Wollondilly supplies much of Sydney Metropolitan and surrounding areas with water from Warragamba Dam, Cataract Dam in Appin, Cordeaux Dam in Wilton and Avon and Nepean Dams even though located in the Wingecarribee Shire is accessed via road through Wollondilly's Bargo. The region has thus far recorded two earthquakes in history ‚Äì One occurring in Appin on March 17 1999, and one in Picton on March 9 1973. The Picton one had a damage total of $2.8 million, with some minor damage in Bowral and Wollongong. The earthquakes had a magnitude scale of 4.8 and 5.6, respectively. Councils The administrative towns of the Macarthur Region are: * Campbelltown where the seat of chambers of the City of Campbelltown is based. * Camden where the seat of chambers of the Camden Council is based. * Picton where the seat of chambers of the Wollondilly Shire is based. Camden Council announced in May 2012 that it will transfer its administrative headquarters to Oran Park. History The history of the region begins over 40,000 years ago and is contained in the continuing culture of the Tharawal people. The land still contains reminders of their past lives in rock engravings, cave paintings, axe grinding grooves and shell middens. Their culture also remains in the surviving songs, stories and descendants. The lands of the Tharawal language Nation extended from approximately Botany Bay to Shoalhaven and to the foothills of the mountain ranges. The principal symbol of the Tharawal nation is the lyrebird. European history began in 1788 shortly after settlement at Sydney Cove, when the colony's entire herd of cattle (four cows and two bulls) strayed from their enclosure and were lost. In 1795 a greatly enlarged herd of 61 cattle were discovered on the grassy land between the Nepean River and Georges River. This area was promptly named the \\"Cowpastures\\" ‚Äì and was deemed a restricted area to provide ongoing protection for the herd; this restriction was short-lived as the herd, deemed too aggressive to be tamed, was destroyed. The early settlement of the area was described by Lachlan Macquarie in his journals, whose accounts include the description of Elizabeth Macarthur being met in a 'miserable' bark hut, the only accommodation then existing at Camden Park. In 1803, John Macarthur had been granted 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) at the Cowpastures and began grazing Merino sheep. His sons William and James introduced viticulture and a commercial nursery, and a successful dairy was founded by Emily Stone, James' wife. The region is steeped in history with statesmen, adventurers, larrikins and villains all having an association with the Macarthur region which makes it a tourist destination.  Local attractions  Major attractions of Camden are: *Australian Botanic Garden, Mt Annan, Mount Annan Mount Annan Botanic Gardens is a botanic garden opened in 1988. It is currently the largest botanic gardens in Australia and is administered by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. It is home to a large collection of native plants, and includes facilities such as picnic areas (with barbecues), walking trails and a restaurant. *Camden Park Estate, Camden Camden Park House built by the Macarthurs. Camden Park Estate was the country property of Australian Wool Pioneers John Macarthur and his wife Elizabeth Macarthur, and became the principal residence of their family after John's death. Centrepiece of the original 2023.5 hectares (5000 acres) granted to Macarthur by the Governor of New South Wales, at the request of Lord Camden, is Camden Park House, designed by John Verge in the neo-Palladian style favoured by the colony's wealthy pastoral 'exclusives', and built between 1832 and 1834; Macarthur himself did not live to see the house completed. Currently, the house remains on 388.5 hectares (960 acres) of the original estate. Macarthur's descendants still reside on the house and property. Adjacent to Camden Park, though once within its extent, is Belgenny Farm, which is popularly called the \\"Birthplace of Australia's Agriculture\\". Designed by architect Henry Kitchen, Belgenny Cottage was built c1821 and was mentioned in Kitchen's submission to Commissioner John Thomas Bigge's enquiry into the state of the colony under Governor Lachlan Macquarie. This original 'cottage orn√©e', which was demolished in the early 1900s and replaced with the current weatherboard structure, was used by the family when visiting the property until the construction of Camden Park House on an adjacent hilltop. John Macarthur himself died in the cottage in 1834, and was buried in the family cemetery immediately to the south. Currently, the farm is home to descendants of sheep that were brought by the Macarthurs and has a functioning vineyard that produces wine as well as orchards. A 2010 archaeological survey and dig to the north of Belgenny may have determined the location of the original 'miserable hut'. *Camden Valley Golf Resort, Catherine Field Camden Valley Golf Resort, opened in 1964 by architect Prosper Ellis, is a popular 27 hole golf course.

The tunnel then served as a mushroom farm and ammunition storage facility during the war years. Currently the tunnel is empty although it is popular with ghost-hunters due to many local folk tales claiming that it is haunted. Subsequently, it has been featured by both print and television media. *New South Wales Rail Transport Museum, Thirlmere *Thirlmere Lakes National Park, Couridjah Thirlmere Lakes National Park is part of the Blue Mountains Heritage Area in which the park consists of 5 important freshwaters lakes that are abundant in waterbirds and native reeds.

He was occasionally credited as Normann Burton. Early life Born in New York City, Burton was a student of The Actor's Studio. After early work on stage, he broke into films with a minor role in Fright (1956). Career His career in film and television was long and relatively successful, but he never achieved major recognition. He played the Hunt Leader, a gorilla, in the science fiction film Planet of the Apes, notable as being the first ape to be seen by both Taylor and the audience, and also appeared as a (human) army officer in the second sequel Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971). In film, he is perhaps best known for his unconventional (and frequently disparaged) performance as Felix Leiter in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever (1971). He played Will Giddings, an ill fated engineer, in the action film The Towering Inferno (1974), and his later films included The Gumball Rally (1976), Crimes of Passion (1984) and Deep Space (1988). He played Dennis Christopher's mean and ill fated boss in the slasher Fade To Black (1980). On television, he is best known for his performance as Inter-Agency Defense Command's supervisor Joe Atkinson during the second season of the DC Comics-based fantasy adventure drama series The New Adventures of Wonder Woman starring Lynda Carter. He also played Burt Dennis in the situation comedy The Ted Knight Show in the spring of 1978, and appeared as General George Marshall in the 1988 television miniseries War and Remembrance. Throughout his life, Burton was a devotee of the method school of acting, and taught method acting in Lakeside, California. Death Burton was just six days short of his 80th birthday when he died as a result of an auto accident while returning from Ajijic, Mexico near the California-Arizona state line.Theatre World Selected filmography *Fright (1957) - Reporter - Thompkins *Pretty Boy Floyd (1960) - Bill Courtney *Hand of Death (1962) - Chief Homicide Investigator *Womanhunt (1962) *Wild Seed (1967) - Policeman *Valley of the Dolls (1967) - Neely O'Hara's Director (uncredited) *Planet of the Apes (1968) - Hunt Leader *R.

Yi Hwang had retired to the location in 1549 and begun construction on the facility, a private Korean Confucian academy offering instruction in the classics and honouring the sages with regular memorial rites. Like other Korean Confucian academies, Dosan Seowon serves two purposes: education and commemoration. The site was well known in Korea as one of the leading academies and was home to the Toegye School of Thought for over 400 years. Although the educational function of the facility has long since ceased, the commemorative ceremonies have been and are still held twice a year. The ancient academy was royally chartered in 1575 by King Seonjo and was featured on the reverse of the South Korean 1,000 won bill from 1975 to 2007 (BOK Series Designation Series II (ÎÇò) 1983‚Äì2002). Construction The Dosan Seowon complex consists of \\"Dosan Seodang\\" (lecture hall), which Toegye built and where he taught his students and where a tablet reading \\"Dosan Seowon\\", that was a gift from King Seonjo, still hangs, \\"Nongun Jeongsa,\\" (dormitory for the students), and \\"Jeongyodang,\\" (square lotus pond). Dosan Seodang is composed of three parts; an exposed floor, a large room, and a kitchen. As Toegye was not wealthy, it took him four years to complete the construction of this building. A small signboard reading \\"Dosan Seowon\\", whose calligraphy Toegye he himself wrote, still hangings on one of the pillars at the end of Dosan Seodang. Looking carefully at the Dosan Seodang floor, you will see an extension made of wooden planks. One of Toegye‚Äôs students, Jeonggu, recommended that Toegye extend the building's floor to accommodate more students. But although Toegye turned down Jeonggu's recommendation, Jeonggu and his fellow students hastily attached wooden planks to the floor while Toegye was out. Consequently, this part of the floor is not very elegant in construction and appearance (see Gallery photo below). The garden is small but Toegye dug a small square pond called \\"Jeongudang\\" in the eastern part of the compound where he raised lotus flowers, and planted apricot trees in the western part. Toegye used to call apricots, bamboos, chrysanthemums, and pine trees his \\"friends\\", but he loved apricot trees most. Evidence of his love of the apricot tree is one given to him by his kisaeng lover, Doo-hyang, sad to part with him. His final words were, \\"Water the (ume) tree\\".

They also recorded league cup and county cup success in that spell, and had some lengthy runs in the FA Vase, including reaching the final in 1981‚Äì82, when they lost the final 3‚Äì0 to Forest Green Rovers at Wembley Stadium. After a period of less success, the club won two more Alliance titles in the mid-1990s, and then began to build for a rise up the football pyramid. Floodlights had been erected at their Kirklington Road ground in 1991, with covered accommodation following, which has since been extended, and seating installed. This enabled the club to be accepted for the Central Midlands League in 2003. They finished third in the lower (\\"Premier\\") division in their first season, earning promotion to the Supreme Division where they played until they were promoted to the Northern Counties East League Division One in 2007.

After being commissioned a Lieutenant he was sent to the Philippines and was attached to the 57th Infantry Regiment (United States) of the Philippine Scouts. After entering active service, according to Malcolm Gladwell, Nininger \\"wrote a friend to say that he had no feelings of hate, and did not think he could ever kill anyone out of hatred. He had none of the swagger of the natural warrior. He worked hard and had a strong sense of duty.\\" Nininger loved to draw pictures. During the first month of the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, Nininger's unit helped prepare American defenses in Bataan. After the Japanese launched their assault on Bataan, Nininger voluntarily joined another company because his unit was not yet engaged in combat. Nininger was killed in action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, 1942. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for leading an assault on Japanese positions. He was the first American army soldier to be so honored in the Second World War. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Second Lieutenant, 57th Infantry, Philippine Scouts, U.S. Army.

When enharmonically spelled C‚ÄìD‚ÄìE‚ÄìG‚ÄìG()‚ÄìB, it is called the tritone scale.Busby, Paul. \\"Short Scales\\", Scored Changes: Tutorials.

Triad Pairs for Jazz: Practice and Application for the Jazz Improvisor, p.126. . The chords may be considered to contradict each other because of the tritone relationship: \\"Any tendency for a tonality to emerge may be avoided by introducing a note three whole tones distant from the key note of that tonality.\\" At the end of the third tableau, the Petrushka chord appears with Petrushka but at A and E, which, with C and F, create a diminished seventh chord (0, 3, 6, 9) and exhaust the octatonic scale (9 1 4, 3 7 t, 0 4 7, and 6 t 1 = 0 1 3 4 6 7 9 t), \\"and suggests that it did... possess for Stravinsky an a priori conceptual status\\".Taruskin 1987, p.268. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f ew PianoStaff << ew Staff = \\"up\\" \\\\relative c { \\\\time 4/4 s1 } ew Staff = \\"down\\" \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 4/4 \\\\voiceOne \\\\repeat tremolo 16 { { \\\\change Staff = \\"up\\" \\\\voiceTwo 32 } { \\\\change Staff = \\"down\\" \\\\voiceOne 32 } } } >> } Petrushka and origin Although attributed to Stravinsky, the chord (or, more precisely, two simultaneous major chords set a tritone apart, specifically F and B major) was present much earlier in Franz Liszt's Mal√©diction Concerto.Walser, Robert (1998). Keeping Time : Readings in Jazz History, p.215. (Although the exact date of the composition remains unknown, it is estimated by Humphrey Searle to be from about 1840; the composition is believed to have originated from one of Liszt's early works, performed in 1827.) Maurice Ravel uses this chord in his piano work Jeux d'eau to create flourishing, water-like sounds that characterize the piece. In his article \\"Ravel's 'Russian' Period: Octatonicism in His Early Works, 1893-1908\\", Steven Baur notes that Jeux d'eau was composed in 1901, ten years before Stravinsky composed Petrushka (1911), suggesting that Stravinsky may have learned the trick from Ravel. Stravinsky heard Jeux d'eau and several other works by Ravel no later than 1907 at the \\"Evenings for Contemporary Music\\" program.Journal of the American Musicological Society 52 (1999), 531‚Äì592. Stravinsky used the chord repeatedly throughout the ballet Petrushka to represent the puppet and devised the chord to represent the puppet's mocking of the crowd at the Shrovetide Fair.Libbey, Ted (1999). The NPR Guide to Building a Classical CD Collection: The 350 Essential Works, p.185. . Eric Walter White suggests and dismisses the possibility that the Petrushka chord is derived from Messiaen's \\"second Modes of limited transposition\\" (the octatonic scale) in favor of a \\"black key/white key bitonality\\" which results from, \\"Stravinsky's well known habit of composing at the piano.\\"Eric Walter White (1966).

(see also Tritone substitution) The 1979 song \\"Kogaion\\" by Romanian progressive rock band Sfinx makes use of the chord.

It is sometimes considered conspecific with the streaked tuftedcheek, P. boissonneautii, of South America. Birds from Colombia and Ecuador are sometimes considered a separate species, the Pacific tuftedcheek (P. johnsoni). It occurs as a resident breeder above in wet mountain forests with many epiphytes. The female lays one white egg in a thickly lined old woodpecker nest. One parent, probably the female, incubates the single white egg for 29 days to hatching, covering the egg with leaves when she leaves the nest. The buffy tuftedcheek is typically long, weighs , and has a long bright rufous tail. The back is brown, and the wings are blackish with buff wingbars. The head has a buff-streaked dark brown cap and dusky eyestripe. The cheeks sport a tuft of richly buff feathers. The throat is buff and the underparts are olive brown with diffuse spotting on the breast. The sexes are similar, but young birds lack the buff crown streaks, have more sooty marking on the back and underparts, and their flanks are more orange in hue. This species has a hard wooden ' song, often given as a duet. The call is a sharp chip. The buffy tuftedcheek forages actively amongst mosses, vines, bromeliads and other epiphytes for insects, spiders, and even small amphibians. It will join mixed feeding flocks in the middle levels of the forest. The scientific and alternative English names of this bird commemorate American amateur ornithologist, George Newbold Lawrence.

Early years Pyotr Petrovich Schmidt was born in 1867 in Odessa, Russian Empire, now Ukraine, to the family of rear admiral and the head of Berdyansk port, Pyotr Petrovich Schmidt (1828-1888). His father Pyotr Petrovich Schmidt Sr participated in the defense of Sebastopol during the Siege of Sevastopol (1854). His mother Yekaterina Yakovlevna Schmidt (born von Wagner) was of German descent. Schmidt spent his youth in Berdyansk, where his father was city governor (gradonachalnik) and city port head. In 1883 Schmidt Jr entered the Naval Officers' Corps in Saint Petersburg and after graduation enrolled in the Imperial Russian Navy. He resigned in 1888 and married Dominika Gavrilovna Pavlova. After the birth of his son Yevgeniy in 1889, the family moved to Taganrog, where Alexander Nentzel, manager of the Azov-Don Commercial Bank offered him a bookkeeper position. In 1893, Schmidt left Taganrog and enrolled again in the Imperial Russian Navy. Uprising in the Black Sea Fleet The uprising in the Black Sea Fleet was part of the Russian Revolution of 1905. Schmidt was a lieutenant commander of the destroyer Number 253 in the Imperial Russian Navy. On 1 October 1905, he made a speech during a meeting in Sebastopol, urging the citizens to stand up for their rights and demanding the authorities free political prisoners. Participants of the meeting headed towards the city prison, where they were met with machine gun fire. In the following days, Pyotr Schmidt gave a speech at the special session of the Sevastopol City Council and at the cemetery during the funeral ceremony, where he was arrested. He was conveyed to the battleship Tri Sviatitelia, which provoked protests and the authorities were forced to release him. On 7 November 1905, Schmidt was retired with the rank of captain (–∫–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω 2 —Ä–∞–Ω–≥–∞). The uprising continued and with the cruiser Ochakov in its center. On November 26, 1905 a mutiny began the cruiser, and its officers were expelled from the ship. Lieutenant Commander Schmidt, though not being a member of RSDRP, was invited to take command of the rebel ships, including the minelayer Griden, gunboat Usuriets, destroyers Zavetniy, Zorkiy, Svirepiy, 265, 268, 270, training ship Dnestr and mine carrier Bug. The same day, the Soviets of Sailors' and Soldiers' Deputies decided to start a Black Sea Fleet-wide mutiny and appoint Schmidt as Commander of the Fleet. On November 28, Pyotr Schmidt arrived on board the cruiser Ochakov, which raised the red flag and the signal Commanding the Fleet. The rebel squadron was also joined by the battleship Panteleimon. The revolutionary forces made up some 8,200 vs. 10,000 government forces. Schmidt sent a telegram to Emperor Nicholas II of Russia: > The glorious Black Sea Fleet, sacredly devoted to the people, demands Your > Majesty to immediately call a meeting of the Constituent Assembly > (–£—á—Ä–µ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ), and no longer obeys orders of Your ministers. > Commander of the Fleet P. Schmidt. The commander of the Imperial Russian forces, General Meller-Zakomelskiy, gave an ultimatum demanding immediate capitulation, but there was no reply. Three hours after the ultimatum, the government forces opened fire at rebel ships and barracks. In 90 minutes, the revolutionary squadron was defeated by the government ships led by the battleship Rostislav. Schmidt and his 16-year-old son were captured, and all who remained alive were arrested. Next day, the government forces supported by artillery took the rebellion barracks. Aftermath A closed hearing was held in February 1906 in a small fortress in the island of Tendra near Sebastopol. Schmidt and other leaders of the uprising were sentenced to death. He was executed on 19 March 1906 at Berezan Island by the crew of the gunboat Terets. In 1922, Mikhail Stavraki, commander of the gunboat's firing squad was discovered in Batumi in possession of five fake passports in different names and old bank notes, by Cheka agents. The trial of Stavraki, who was Schmidt's classmate at the Naval Corps in St Petersburg, was held on 1 April 1923 in Sebastopol, while most of the witnesses and participants of the events were still alive. On 3 April 1923 the Military Board of the Supreme Court of the USSR sentenced Stavraki to death by firing squad.

The remains were buried in Sevastopol, and in the 1960s a 15-metre-high stela was placed on the island of Berezan. * After the Russian Civil War streets in several Soviet cities were named after Lieutenant Schmidt: in Astrakhan, Bataisk, Vinnitsa, Vologda, Vyazma, Berdyansk, Tver (boulevard), Vladivostok, Yeysk, Gatchina, Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Yegoryevsk, Kazan, Lysva, Murmansk, Bobruisk, Nizhniy Tagil, Novorossiysk, Odessa, Pervomaisk, Ochakov, Samara, Sevastopol, Simferopol, Taganrog (unofficially the widest street in the world; its sides are situated on different sides of the bay), Tyumen, Kerch, Kirovograd, Kremenchug, Kamenets-Podolsky, Khabarovsk, Kharkov, Lyubotin, Melitopol, Petropavlovsk. * On 31 December 1922 the old (1899) torpedo boat Svirepy of the Sokol class was renamed Lieutenant Schmidt.

Established in 1974, it is primarily tasked with the training of military leaders in the Commando Formation. Courses conducted by the CTW include the Commando Section Leaders' Course (CSLC), the Commando Small Boat Operators' Course, the Commando Officer Conversion Course (COCC), and the highly esteemed Singapore Armed Forces Ranger Course. Section leader training The Commando Section Leaders' Course (CSLC), as its name implies, trains Commando trainees to be section leaders, taking in selected candidates from those who have completed the Basic Commando Training phase. These candidates are put through a range of tests, including the Physical Readiness Test, the Commando Common Tasks test, and an interview by the Commando Chain of Command, before acceptance. The course is a physically demanding one, with trainees expected to complete the Standard Obstacle Course immediately after a 5-kilometre run, all in combat gear and within timing. They must also pass two fast marches in Full Battle Order over a distance of six and twelve kilometres. In the meantime, various field-craft skills are inculcated to enable them to lead a section effectively and to improve survival skill. Officer training Commando Officers are selected from within its own ranks and over a year-long period of assessment, unlike the majority of those from the rest of the SAF who are selected during the 3-month centralized phase of Basic Military Training. Potential candidates are assessed from the time they are enlisted into the Formation, and only the top graduates of the Commando Section Leaders' Course are selected for further screening. About 15 successfully go on attend the Infantry Officers' Cadet Course at Officer Cadet School in the SAFTI Military Institute. Upon successful completion, they are commissioned as Commando Officers, and attend a Commando Officer Conversion Course (COCC) at the CTW for a seven-week period, where they are trained to take on the role of Platoon Commander with the 1st Commando Battalion. Other graduates from Officer Cadet School, as well as commissioned Officers in the SAF, may also apply to join the COCC to become Commando Officers. Ranger training The Singapore Armed Forces Ranger Course is reputed to be the toughest course in the SAF, with 65 days of intense training conducted by the CTW. Initially developed based on the experiences of Singaporean Rangers trained at the U.S. Army Rangers School in Fort Benning, United States, it was first conducted in Singapore in 1978, and is now an annual affair at the training wing's Pasir Ris Camp base. Any regular or national serviceman of the SAF may apply for the course, so long that they have a superior's recommendation from their specific unit and attained a minimum rank of Corporal, after which applicants are assessed physically to ensure suitability. Training slots are also limited per year. For Commando regulars, enrolment is compulsory, and exceptional individuals/graduates are further recommended to attend US Ranger School for advanced training. Graduates of the advanced training can then wear the US version of the \\"Rangers\\" tab on their uniform.

The offer was posted on many websites, including FatWallet, and attracted many new customers. Wengo later suspended many of these accounts, in the company's interests, after many people began abusing the unlimited calling system. Originally, Wengo was supporting the development of a free and open source (GPL) VoIP (including video conferencing, SMS and chat) softphone through which it offered PC to PSTN phone calls.

If the number of melted coins is excluded, the highest mintage would be the 50 franc piece minted in 1988 commemorating the 50th anniversary of the reign of Prince Franz Joseph II and the 10 franc piece minted in 1990 commemorating the succession of Prince Hans-Adam II. Both number 35,000. History of early currencies used in Liechtenstein The following denominations were issued * 1728: 20 kreutzer, thaler, 1 thaler, 1 ducat and 10 ducats * 1758: 1/2 thaler, 1 thaler and 1 ducat * 1778: 1/2 thaler, 1 thaler and 1 ducat The ducats were in minted in 986 gold, and all other coins were minted in 583 silver. All coins bore on the obverse side the right-facing bust of each prince and on the reverse side his arms. In 1862, under Prince Johann II, another coin was minted, a vereinsthaler, which had the same design as the previous coins and was taken out of circulation in 1893, with a value of 3.53 crowns. There was a currency reform on 26 August 1898. 1 florin (also referred to as a gulden) now had the value of a Liechtenstein crown and there were 100 hellers in a crown. Under Johann II, silver coins were issued with denominations of 1 crown, 2 crowns and 5 crowns. Coins with denominations of 10 crowns and 20 crowns were minted in gold. Unlike the previous coins, the obverse side depicted the left- facing bust of the prince. These coins were taken out of circulation on 28 August 1920. History of Liechtenstein franc 50 Liechtenstein franc coin, gold, 2006 On 26 May 1924, there was another currency reform, the new currency had 100 rappens to the franc. This currency is still the official currency of Liechtenstein today. Prince Johann II had silver coins minted with denominations of franc, 1 franc, 2 francs and 5 francs. When Franz I came to power, he did not have any more of these denominations minted, because there were enough of his predecessor's silver coins in circulation. During his rule, gold coins with denominations of 10 francs and 20 francs were minted in 1930. They depict on the obverse side the bust of the prince, now facing to the right again. From then on, Liechtenstein francs were minted only for collection purposes, since the Swiss franc had become the main currency of Liechtenstein. In 1946 Prince Franz Josef II had two denominations of coins minted, with face values of 10 francs and 20 francs; and ten years later gold coins with face values of 25 francs, 50 francs and 100 francs. The obverse of these coins, for the first time, depicts a Liechtenstein prince with his wife. The hundredth anniversary of the National bank of Liechtenstein in 1961 was celebrated by the minting of two gold coins with a face value 25 francs and 50 francs. For Franz Josef's golden jubilee in 1988, a special commemorative 10 franc silver coin and a 50 franc gold coin were minted. In 1990, Hans Adam II had a 10 franc silver coin and a 50 franc gold coin minted to celebrate the ceremony of Homage (), marking the transfer of power to the new prince. In 2006, two coin designs with the same face value were issued in celebration of the 200-year anniversary of the sovereignty of the Principality of Liechtenstein. In 2019, a set of four coins, in denominations of 5-, 10-, 25 and 100 francs, were issued in celebration of the 300th anniversary of the sovereignty of the Principality of Liechtenstein.5 Franken - Anton Florian 300 Year Liechtenstein Numista (https://en.numista.com).

He was Surgeon-General of the Red Army (1937‚Äì1946), an academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences (from 1939), an academician and the first director of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR (1944‚Äì1946), a Hero of Socialist Labor (from 1943), Colonel General of medical services, and a Stalin Prize winner (1941). He was a veteran of the Russo-Japanese War, First World War, Winter War and the German-Soviet War. Early years Nikolay Burdenko was born on 3 June 1876 in the village of Kamenka in the Nizhnelomovsky Uyezd of the Penza Governorate (modern-day Kamenka, Kamensky District, Penza Oblast of Russia), one of the eight children of Nil Karpovich Burdenko (1839‚Äî1906) and Varvara Markianovna Burdenko (n√©e Smagina) (1851‚Äî1897). His paternal grandfather Karp Fyodorovich Burdenko came from serfs of the Kuznetsky Uezd of the Saratov Governorate where he served as a landlord's estate manager and his wife ‚Äî as a maid; after being granted freedom they moved to Penza and then ‚Äî to Verhniy Lomov of the Penza Governorate. Nikolay's father also worked as an estate manager for the major general Vladimir Voeykov (ru) who served in the Svita of Nicholas II and was close to the Emperor's family. Nikolay's mother was a housewife who came from peasants of the Tambov Governorate.Pavel Nilin (1982).

In 1891, he entered Penza theological seminary and was soon sent to the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy as the best student. In 1897, he left it to study medicine at the recently opened Faculty of Medicine of the Tomsk Imperial University. There, he became fascinated with anatomy and operative surgery, and by the third course he was appointed as a prosector's assistant. He was then excluded from the university for participating in the 1899 Russian student strike, but was pardoned and restored just to be excluded for the second time in 1901 on the same account. After that, he was forced to leave Tomsk.People of Russian Science. Essays on Prominent Figures in Natural History and Engineering.

Once again, he became involved with the student protest movement and had to spend a year in the Kherson Governorate treating children with typhus, tuberculosis and other epidemic diseases. He was then restored in the university. During that time he worked a lot as a surgeon and took part in medical expeditions around the country to fight epidemics of typhus, smallpox and scarlet fever. In January 1904, Burdenko volunteered for the Russo-Japanese War. He served in the field ambulance detachment in Manchuria and was shot in the arm while saving wounded under hostile fire during the Battle of Te-li-Ssu. He was awarded with the Cross of St. George for his service. On December he demobilized and returned to his studies. In 1905, he was invited to the surgery department of the Riga town hospital for practice.Burdenko Nikolay Nilovich at the War Heroes database (in Russian) In 1906, Burdenko graduated from the university and moved back to Penza where he became a surgeon at the local zemstvo hospital. Simultaneously he worked on a thesis on the consequences of portal vein ligation. He was heavily influenced by the works of Ivan Pavlov that inspired him to write five scientific efforts. In March 1909, he earned the Doctor of Medicine degree and the next year he became a privatdozent and an associate professor at the University of Yuryev. World War I With the start of the World War I in 1914, Burdenko once again volunteered for the frontline and joined the Red Cross detachment of the Northwestern Front, taking part in the East Prussian Operation and the Battle of the Vistula River. In addition to the duties of field surgeon he also evacuated wounded soldiers under hostile fire, organized triage, aid and dressing stations, including special sections for soldiers with stomach, lungs and skull wounds. For the first time in battlefield medicine Burdenko applied first aid care for skull injuries. From 1915 to 1917, he also worked as a consultant surgeon, first at the Kovno and Vilna Governorates, then at the 2nd Army and various Riga hospitals. In March 1917, he was appointed the Main Battlefield Medical Inspector, but left the post on May due to disagreements with the Russian Provisional Government and returned to front.Mark Mirsky (1983). Healing with a Scalpel. Academician N. N. Burdenko. Moscow: Znanie, pp. 57-67, 131‚Äì160 He was diagnosed with the post-concussion syndrome after one of the battles and had to return to his Alma mater where he headed the surgery department. Following the occupation of Yuryev by German forces Burdenko was suggested to continue to carry out his duties under the new power, but he declined the offer and in June 1918 evacuated to Voronezh along with other professors. There, he became one of the founders of the Voronezh State University based on the University of Yuryev. Scientific work Burdenko took active part in building and managing war hospitals for the Red Army. In 1920 he organized medical courses to prepare field surgeons and nurses. Simultaneously he consulted the Voronezh Health Department and continued his scientific work. His researches concerned shock prevention, healing of wounds and infections, surgical treatment of tuberculosis, anesthesia, blood transfusion and so on. At the time he also came to conclusion that neurosurgery must be taken as a separate specialty. In 1923, Burdenko moved to Moscow and became a professor of the Moscow State University where he founded a neurosurgical department; in 1930, it was reorganized into the 1st Moscow Medical Institute. He also headed the university surgical clinic from 1924 until his death which currently bears his name. In 1929, a faculty of field surgery was founded on his initiative. Same year Burdenko was appointed a director of the neurosurgical clinic of the X-ray institute under the People's Commissariat for Health which served as the basis for the world's first Central Neurosurgical Institute founded in 1932 (known today as N .N. Burdenko National Scientific and Practical Center for Neurosurgery).Nikolay Nilovich Burdenko Neurosurgery Institute official website Burdenko was among the first to introduce surgery of the central and peripheral nervous system to clinical practice; he investigated the reasons behind the appearance of shock and the methods of treating it, made a large contribution to the study of the processes which appear in the central and peripheral nervous system in connection with the surgical operation in the case of sharp injuries; he developed the bulbotomy ‚Äî operation on the upper division of the spinal cord. Burdenko created the school of surgeons with a sharply pronounced experimental direction. Works in the domains of the oncology of central and vegetative nervous system, pathology of the liquor circulation, and cerebral blood circulation were the valuable contribution of Burdenko and his school to the theory and practice of neurosurgery. With his active participation, neurosurgical clinics and departments appeared all over the country. Burdenko organized and headed various medical conferences, including the All-Union Neurosurgical Council founded in 1935, and represented Soviet Union at international conferences. He also headed the All-Union Association of Surgeons and became a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1938, the same year he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From 1937, he worked as the main consultant surgeon under the Red Army Board of Health. He also published the first guide concerning field surgery based on his war experience which helped to prepare the army for the World War II. World War II Burdenko in 1942 In 1939, the 64-year-old Burdenko joined the Winter War and spent all four months at the frontline, managing the battlefield surgery. With the start of the Great Patriotic War in 1941, he was appointed the Main Surgeon of the Red Army and participated in some of the first battles that took place near Yartsevo and Vyazma. He organized medical help and personally operated thousands of people. He also tested and actively applied first antibiotics ‚Äî benzylpenicillin and gramicidin ‚Äî to treat injury infections. During one of the Nazi bombings, Burdenko survived another heavy concussion which led to a stroke; he also completely lost ability to talk and had to train hard to regain it. He spent two months in war hospitals and in April 1942 returned to Moscow where he continued scientific work. For the first time in world medicine he suggested to treat pus complications after brain and skull injures by injecting streptocide white into a carotid artery which turned to be more effective compared to intravenous injections practiced at the time. He also promoted the usage of secondary suture and effective treating of artery wounds. In November 1942, Burdenko was appointed a member of the Extraordinary State Commission. He investigated various Nazi crimes, including attacks on medical personnel, hospital trains and Red Cross units. He also headed the special commission of forensic medical examination that revealed atrocities committed during the Nazi occupation of the Smolensk and Oryol Oblast where over 215 000 Soviet civilians were murdered. In January 1944, he headed a special commission established to investigate the Katyn massacre. The commission's report assigned Nazi Germany the responsibility for the massacre, factually carried out by the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs), the Soviet secret police. Based on the autopsy performed by 75 doctors, evidences found on corpses and testimony collected from witnesses, the commission reported that the massacre happened during the autumn of 1941 and that methods used to kill Polish officers were identical to those used by German forces during occupation of Soviet cities.24 January 1944, Special commission's final report, p. 513 (in Russian) from the book Katyn.

It was designed in accordance with plans developed by Burdenko and was partially based on the Institute of Experimental Medicine ‚Äî the first Russian research institute that existed from 1890 to 1944. Burdenko served as its president from 20 December until his death.How it all started article from the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences website Death In June 1945, he survived a second stroke, and during the summer of 1946 ‚Äî a third one. While in hospital, Burdenko finished a report on healing of gunshot wounds. Burdenko died on 11 November 1946, just several months after the third stroke. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. He was survived by his wife Maria Emilievna Burdenko (1882‚Äî1954) and their son Vladimir Nikolaevich Burdenko (1912‚Äî1974), Captain 2nd rank who served on submarine during the war.

Retrieved 2012-03-05. He was generally known as Bruce Dellit. Early life Dellit was born on 7 November 1898 in Darlington, Sydney Australia. He was the son of Albert Dellit, a furniture manufacturer and Agnes Gertrude Mack. His full siblings were Albert Cormack, Leo Harold and Ena May. As a child, he attended Christian Brothers' College, Waverley. After leaving school, Dellit gained employment with the architect John L. Berry and at 16 he enrolled at the Sydney Technical College From 1919, Dellit studied architecture under Professor Leslie Wilkinson at the University of Sydney for one day a week. Career From 1918 Dellit worked for Hall & Prentice in Queensland and, after returning to Sydney, joined Spain & Cosh in 1922. He set up his own practice in 1928. Dellit is most noted for his design of the art deco ANZAC War Memorial in Hyde Park, Sydney, built to commemorate all who fought in the First World War. Dellit won the project in a design competition that attracted over 100 entries.K. S. Inglis, \\"Sacred Places: War Memorials in the Australian Landscape\\", Melbourne University Press (1998), pp. 289-297. Online version retrieved 2012-03-06. He introduced the new fashion for Art Deco (more familiar for entertainment buildings) devoid of any classical details and adding a stepped roof. Dellit engaged the sculptor, Rayner Hoff, to create the statues and bas-reliefs for the monument. Dellit continued to complete several commercial and residential buildings during the 1930s. Notable Works=Kyle House= After beginning his private practice in 1928, Dellit's first major project was Kyle House in Macquarie Place, Sydney. The building, notable for its strong vertical lines and dominating ground floor arch, is considered among the earliest examples of Sydney commercial architecture embracing the Inter-War Art Deco style. =ANZAC War Memorial= Dellit's ANZAC War Memorial, within Hyde Park Sydney, is considered to be the \\"epitome\\" of pairing of the symmetrical classicism of the Moderne style architecture with Art Deco, decorative embellishments. Dellit's \\"masterpiece\\" is complemented by Rayner Hoff's Art Deco sculptures and reliefs depicting the men of the First Australian Imperial Force. =Kinselas Funeral Chapel= Built in 1910 at the present location of Taylor Square Darlinghurst. The original building was converted into an Art Deco style by Dellit after being purchased by funeral director Charles Kinsela in 1932. The building, which is now used as a bar, contains the work of Rayner Hoff and is considered among the best examples of Art Deco \\"funerary spaces\\" in Sydney. Personal life Dellit married Victoria Clara Millar on 15 October 1921 in Queensland. Children of the marriage were Portia, Albert Victor (known as Victor) and Deirdre. Victor was also a prominent architect. In 1942 Dellit died from cancer in Hornsby near Sydney, NSW.

History The PTW was established in March 1974 as the Parachute Training School (PTS), with its Parachute Jump Instructors having received intensive training in the United States and New Zealand. The fully Commando affair saw its first batch of national service trainees graduating on 19 October 1974, before opening up the course for non-Commandos. It has also trained non-Singaporeans, with its first trainees being 12 men from the 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment.

Non- Commandos wear the badge without any backing. Basic training The Basic Airborne Course (BAC) has about 120 to 160 trainees per class, involving largely Commandos as well as their counterparts from the rest of the SAF or beyond. With the primary task of teaching trainees to execute static line parachuting, they introduce the three most important aspects affecting their performance, namely the Exit, the Flight, and the Landing. The need for quick reactive actions during these aspects of the jump required intensive training over a course of 3 weeks. Commando trainees taking part in the course will have to go through Module one and Module two, namely clean fatigue and equipment jumps respectively. Hence, trainees will have to complete five jumps, with 3 clean fatigue and 2 equipment jumps. The minimum requirement to graduate from the course is to at least complete module 1 with 3 clean fatigue jumps.

Conflict in Northern Italy centred around the Spanish-held Duchies of Milan and Mantua, which controlled access to the southern borders of both France and Austria. When the war began in 1701, Savoy allied with France; despite being out numbered, by February 1702 the Imperialists held the strategic initiative. Vend√¥me took the offensive, taking Modena and Reggio in July, followed by Luzzara in August, a vital crossing point over the River Po. Threatened with being cut off from his supply base at Mirandola, Prince Eugene launched a series of attacks on the French positions at Luzzara. Fighting continued until midnight, when the Imperialists ended their attack, having failed to break through; they suffered 2,000 casualties, the French lost around 4,000. While this ended Vend√¥me's offensive for the year, the French-Savoyard army had recovered nearly all the ground lost in 1701. Background Prince Eugene (1663‚Äì1736) The War of the Spanish Succession was triggered by the death in November 1700 of the childless Charles II of Spain. He named his heir as Philip of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV of France, and on 16 November 1700, he became king of the Spanish Empire. In addition to mainland Spain, this included the Spanish Netherlands, large parts of Italy, and much of Central and South America. In 1701, disputes over territorial and commercial rights led to war between France, Spain, and the Grand Alliance, whose candidate was Charles, younger son of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. The war in Northern Italy centred on the Spanish-held Duchies of Milan and Mantua, which were considered essential to the security of Austria's southern borders. In March 1701, French troops occupied both cities; Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy, allied with France, in return for which his daughter Maria Luisa married Philip V. Over the next 12 months, Imperial general Prince Eugene of Savoy won a series of victories over French commander Villeroi, forcing him to withdraw behind the Adda river. He was unable to fully exploit this success as Leopold diverted resources from Italy to deal with problems elsewhere. Instead, he improvised, and in a surprise winter campaign, captured Villeroi at Cremona in February 1702, before laying siege to Modena. Determined to retain control of this region, Louis sent Vend√¥me to replace Villeroi, along with substantial reinforcements. On 12 July, Vend√¥me was joined by Philip V, who had been visiting Spanish possessions in Italy, including Naples, Sicily, and Milan. This brought their combined army up to 30,000 ‚Äì 35,000, including 10,000 Savoyards and five regiments of the Irish Brigade. In July, Vend√¥me captured Modena, then turned north to take Guastalla; on 26 July, he clashed with Imperial cavalry under Visconti at Santa Vittoria. In early August, a detachment under Vend√¥me besieged Luzzara, a small town held by an Austrian garrison of 500, that controlled a bridge over the Po River. Prince Eugene now faced being cut off from his supply base at Mirandola; he abandoned his blockade of Mantua, and marched on Luzzara, telling its governor to hold on until he arrived. Many of his troops were tied up in garrisons at Mirandola, Bersello and Borgoforte, leaving him with a field army of 26,000. On 14 August, he reached Riva, a village north of Luzzara; here he learned the town had already surrendered, and the rest of Vend√¥me's army was moving into a camp just outside. Battle Battle Map; Imperial top (red), French-Savoyard bottom (blue) Between Luzzara and the Po River, there were two earth embankments, built to prevent the river flooding the countryside; a high one just outside the town, and a smaller one close to the river (see Map). Prince Eugene planned to conceal his troops behind these, and take the French- Savoyard army by surprise; since their first task would be to collect forage, and water the horses, he hoped to take them unarmed. He split his forces into two lines, the left under Visconti and the Prince de Commerci, the right under Vaud√©mont, while he commanded the centre. During the morning and early afternoon of 15 August, the Imperialists crossed the Po and moved into position, but were discovered by a French patrol. They quickly formed up, and around 5:00 pm, Prince Eugene ordered a general assault. His right wing was repulsed four times, with heavy losses on both sides, particularly among the Irish units and Albemarle's Regiment holding the French left. The struggle on the other wing was equally bloody; Commerci and his Danish infantry nearly broke through on several occasions, although he and several senior commanders were killed. The broken ground meant cavalry played little part in the battle, which meant casualties were even higher as a proportion of the numbers actually engaged. The French managed to hold their lines until exhaustion and darkness ended the fighting round midnight, and neither army was able to resume the attack in the morning. Since Prince Eugene remained in possession of the battlefield, he claimed it as a victory, according to the practice of the time. Aftermath Louis Joseph, Duke of Vend√¥me 1654‚Äì1712 Although Vend√¥me suffered 4,000 casualties compared to Imperial losses of 2,000, most analysts consider the battle a draw, although it ended the French offensive; the two armies remained facing each other for the next month, occasionally bombarding each other. This allowed Prince Eugene to hold on until the two sides went into winter quarters, but the French-Savoyard forces regained all the ground lost in the previous twelve months. Two days after the battle, Philip returned to Madrid; in January 1703, Prince Eugene was recalled to Vienna to take over as head of the Imperial War Council, and was replaced as commander in Italy by Starhemberg. The Italian theatre remained quiet in 1703; Starhemberg was badly outnumbered, while Vend√¥me spent most of it supporting a futile offensive through the Tyrol by Maximilian of Bavaria. In October 1703, Victor Amadeus II defected to the Alliance; over the next two years, Vend√¥me gradually conquered most of Lombardy. In 1708, Prince Eugene commissioned a series of paintings recording his victories from Dutch artist Jan van Huchtenburg, one being Luzzara.

It is sometimes considered conspecific with the buffy tuftedcheek, P. lawrencii of Central America, Colombia and Ecuador. It occurs as a resident breeder in wet mountain forests, with many epiphytes, above 1500 m. It lays one white egg in a thickly lined old woodpecker nest or other tree cavity. One parent, probably the female, incubates the single white egg for about 29 days to hatching. The streaked tuftedcheek is typically 22 cm long, weighs 48 g, and has a long bright rufous tail. The back is brown with dark streaks. The head has a buff streaked dark brown cap and paler eyestripe. The cheeks sport a tuft of buff- white feathers. The throat is white and the underparts are olive brown with diffuse spotting on the breast. The sexes are similar. This species has a hard wooden ' song, often given as a duet. The call is a sharp '. The streaked tuftedcheek forages actively amongst mosses, vines, bromeliads and other epiphytes for insects, spiders, and even small amphibians.

Transport  The North Shore and Northern lines offer frequent train services to Hornsby Station which is a short walk from the centre. Westfield Hornsby has bus connections to the Sydney CBD, North Shore, Northern Suburbs and Hills District, as well as local surrounding suburbs. It is served by State Transit, Transit Systems, Transdev NSW and Hillsbus. The majority of its bus services are located on Pacific Highway in front of the centre as well as on Station Street on the other side of the station. Westfield Hornsby also has multi level car parks with 3,200 spaces. History The original Westfield Hornsby known as Westfield Plaza opened in July 1961. The centre featured McDowells (later rebranded as Waltons and then Venture), Coles New World and 25 stores. In 1968 Westfield Hornsby received its first major redevelopment which saw the centre quadruple in size. The centre was also upgraded in 1976 and 1979. A competing shopping centre opened on 14 November 1979 by Deputy Premier L J (Jack) Ferguson and Hornsby Shire President Don Evans. The shopping centre known as Northgate featured Grace Bros (rebranded to Myer in 2004), Kmart and 67 speciality stores. In the early 1990s the intersection of Florence Street and Hunter Street became a pedestrian mall with a fountain at the centre of the pedestrian mall. The fountain known as the Hornsby Water Clock was designed by Victor Cusack who previously designed the Pacific Family fountain in 1988 at Warringah Mall. The fountain was unveiled in 1993. In 1999 Westfield purchased the Northgate Shopping Centre and commenced its four stage redevelopment. This redevelopment involved the closure and demolition of the original Westfield centre and incorporation of adjacent Northgate Centre into the development. In January 2000 Westfield was temporarily closed to pave way for the new centre which doubled the retail space and added restaurants and cinemas at a cost of $360 million over a two year period. During this redevelopment, the original Westfield centre was demolished and rebuilt, making it the second Westfield to be completely demolished after Westfield Burwood. It also extended and refurbished former Northgate centre. The development opened in four stages. Stage 1 of the redevelopment opened in the former Northgate side on October 2000 with the Northgate name dropped and part of Westfield. This stage included the opening of Coles and 50 stores. Stage 2 opened in May 2001 which was the old Westfield Hornsby side. This stage was physically separated from the stage 1 site until August when the 2 stages joined together via an underground level. This stage included the opening of Woolworths and 40 speciality stores Stage 3 was completed in September 2001 which included the opening of David Jones, Target, Gowings, a food court and 100 stores. Westfield Hornsby had it's official grand opening on the 26 September 2001. Stage 4 of the development opened on 29 November 2001 with the opening of the nine screen Greater Union Cinema (now Event Cinemas) and restaurant precinct which opened on 25 November 2001. In 2005 the three level Gowings store closed and was replaced by JB Hi-Fi on the upper level, Macro Wholefoods (rebranded to Thomas Dux Grocer on 26 September 2009 before closing in April 2016 and replaced by Toys R Us until 2018 which is now Uniqlo which opened in April 2019) on the middle level and Dan Murphy's on the lower level. On 24 September 2011 Apple opened it's 13th store in Australia in the centre. In July 2014, as part of a restructure of the Westfield Group, it came under the control of the Scentre Group. On 12 January 2020 Myer closed down it's store after 40 years of trade and was replaced by Harvey Norman on the Upper level which opened on 3 October 2020.  Tenants  Westfield Hornsby has 99,550m¬≤ of floor space. The major retailers include David Jones, Kmart, Target, Aldi, Coles, Woolworths, Uniqlo, Apple, Harvey Norman, JB Hi-Fi, Rebel Sport, Fitness First, Timezone and Event Cinemas.

Nearby, a demountable structure was completely uplifted and landed a few metres away. There were no reported injuries. Media frequently reported the tornado as a 'mini-tornado' however, no such classification exists. The Bureau of Meteorology has classified the tornado as an EF1 with winds between 117 km/h to 180 km/h. * On 13 February 2015, a bomb threat caused a centre lockdown, and the central plaza was evacuated. There were unconfirmed reports that a man left a bag unattended at a restaurant and told staff it was a bomb. The man was later taken into police custody. * On 31 March 2016, a man was stabbed to death at a restaurant by his partner's ex-husband. The attacker allegedly walked into the restaurant at 9.30pm, took a knife from the kitchen and stabbed the pair. The woman suffered serious injuries to her chest and a punctured sternum. Witnesses allege that after he stabbed the pair, he calmly walked up and down the shopping centre's concourse, covered in blood and carrying the 20 cm knife in his hand. He surrendered himself to police arrest without incident. * On 9 June 2016, a patient from a nearby psychiatric hospital escaped and confronted pedestrians at the central plaza. The man was confronted by police and was shot after he attempted to retaliate. As a result, three bystanders were injured by ricocheting bullets that struck them in the legs.

Phi Sigma Iota pledge \\"We believe that a discerning and sympathetic understanding of the peoples of the world is essential to the welfare of humanity; that peace among nations and international amity are dependent upon an altruistic willingness to appreciate the character, the ideals, and the culture and civilization of other countries; that the study of foreign languages is one of the best means of contributing to such global understanding; that a broad study of international cultures is also essential to an adequate comprehension of all races and peoples; that it is our duty as world citizens to learn all that we can about the peoples of the world and to strive to judge their achievements objectively, fairly, and tolerantly; that it is our obligation to disseminate our knowledge and informed judgment as widely as possible in order to further international understanding; that it is incumbent upon us to attempt to inspire in others an interest in the language, literature, and other cultural manifestations of all races and peoples; and finally, we believe that we ourselves should continue the study of language, literature and culture in order to extend the horizons of our own understanding.\\" History Phi Sigma Iota was founded in 1922 at Allegheny College by Dr. Henry W. Church, members of his department of languages, and advanced students who were meeting to discuss linguistic and literary matters. PSI became a national society when Beta Chapter was established at The Pennsylvania State University in April 1925. Less than a year later, Gamma Chapter at the College of Wooster followed them. With these three chapters as the nucleus of the national organization, the first convention was held in May 1926, at Allegheny College. Since that time expansion has been steady. In November 1935, Phi Sigma Iota was merged with Alpha Zeta Pi, a similar society west of the Mississippi. The merger took place at a National Convention held at Bloomington, Illinois. Dr. Etienne Renaud and his associates in the Department of Languages had organized Alpha Zeta Pi in October 1917 at the University of Denver. In 1949, Phi Sigma Iota was granted membership into the U. S. Association of College Honor Societies, the first language society to receive that honor. In 1978, under the Presidency of Dr. Santiago Vilas, the Society expanded into the National Foreign Language Honor Society Phi Sigma Iota to honor outstanding achievements in any foreign language including Classics, Philology, Applied Linguistics, Comparative Literature, and Bilingual Education. In 1982, the Society became the International Foreign Language Honor Society by installing its first Chapter in a foreign country (Universidad Regiomontana, Monterrey, Mexico). Every year Phi Sigma Iota awards several scholastic grants to its members. The first scholarship was established in 1939 in memory of the founder and first National President, Dr. Church. In 1970, another scholarship was established in memory of Dr. Anthony S. Corbiere, who for nearly thirty years was National Historian, Editor of the Newsletter, and Executive Secretary of Phi Sigma Iota. In 2000, two additional named scholarships were inaugurated. One to honor Dr. Cleon Capsus, professor of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of South Florida and one to honor the years of devoted work on behalf of PSI by Dr. Santiago Vilas. The Dr. Marie-France Hilgar Scholarship was established to honor former President Dr. Hilgar. Insignia and etymology The insignia of the society, adopted in 1935, was designed by Robert E. Dengler, 1893‚Äì1973, Professor of Classics at the Pennsylvania State University. The words PHI, SIGMA, and IOTA may be understood, respectively, as Œ¶ŒπŒªŒøœÑŒ∑œÇ (or Philot√®s, meaning Friendship), Œ£œÄŒøœÖŒ¥Œ∑ (or Spoud√©, meaning Research and also Individuality), and ŒôŒ¥ŒπœâŒºŒ± (or Idioma, meaning Zeal). The key of the society is dominated by a five-pointed star. The center of this star represents the literary languages of classical antiquity: Greek, Latin, Sanskrit and Hebrew. These tongues live on today in spirit, furnishing the foundation for many modern languages and transmitting to the western world the basis of much of its culture. Originally a Romance language society, Latin, the foundation of our modern Romance languages, formed the foundation of the insignia and was symbolized by the ivy wreath which surrounds the star on the Phi Sigma Iota key. The key was designed in 1935 by Robert E. Dengler, Professor of Classics at the Pennsylvania State University, and since 1935 was the bimillenniaum of Horace's birth, Dr. Dengler put an ivy wreath in the design to recall the words of Horace, the Roman poet of the height of Augustian literature who wrote: \\"As for me, I want the ivy, the crown of learned brows, that unites me with the gods above...\\" The five-point star originally stood for the Romance languages but now are symbolic of the many rays of learning which emanate from all linguistic and literary traditions. The shield of Phi Sigma Iota comprises designs meant to recall various language and literary traditions represented by the Society. Today the Society represents not only the Romance languages, but all languages. The colors of the Society are purple and white. The Forum The Forum of Phi Sigma Iota is published annually and includes articles (both scholarly and anecdotal), poetry, art, and humor written by and for Society members.

They were produced by mounting the 25 pounder gun howitzer on an American M3A5 Grant tank hull, and were converted by the Ordnance Factory in Bendigo from 1950 to 1952.Horner 1995, p. 432. The Yeramba was withdrawn from service in 1957 after becoming obsolete and remains the only self-propelled artillery introduced into service by the Australian Army.Cecil 2009. The name is from the yeramba, an Aboriginal instrument for throwing spears. History=Development= The 1947 defence program witnessed the formation of the Australian Regular Army and included in the plans for a permanent field force was a number of new armoured formations‚Äîthe 2nd Armoured Brigade Group among them. Allocated to this independent brigade was 22nd Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery. One of the lessons of the war in Europe had been the need for artillery units in armoured brigades to have the same mobility and protection as the tanks they were supporting, and consequently a program was begun to acquire a self-propelled gun. However, as modern self-propelled artillery could not be purchased from overseas, it was decided to adapt a small number of M3 Grant tanks to the role. Although officially known as Ordnance, Quick Firing, 25 pdr Mark 2/1, on Mounting Self propelled 25 pdr (AUST) Mark 1, on Carrier, Grant, Self Propelled 25 pdr (AUST) Mark 1,Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Tank Museum: Vehicle Information Pack No. 7, Self Propelled 25 pdr Gun Yeramba, (excerpts from the Yeramba manual) the name Warragal was proposed to replace this awkward nomenclature in general use. This was rejected, and in January 1951 the name 'SP 25 pounder Yeramba' was accepted as the official short name. Drawings for the Canadian Sexton self-propelled 25 pounder‚Äîalso derived from the M3 chassis‚Äîwere obtained and adapted, with the turret and much of the frontal armour of the Grant replaced by an open-topped fighting compartment. The driver's position and controls were moved down and to the right within the vehicle. Indeed, a new welded, open-topped superstructure was added in place of the turret, forward hull, and sponson-mounted gun. A QF 25 pounder Mk 2/1 with a fixed length recoil system and a muzzle brake was mounted centrally in the superstructure, allowing the gun to traverse over a 40 degree arc. Elevation was limited to 40 degrees, and depression to 9.5 degrees. The more resilient M4 Sherman suspension units replaced the M3 type bogies. Stowage was provided for 88 high explosive and/or smoke shells and 16 armour-piercing (AP) rounds. The 25-pounder and a strengthened saddle were mounted on a bolster- and-beam assembly welded to the track sponsons, whilst the gun was equipped with the same sighting gear as the towed field gun, allowing for both direct and indirect laying. =Trials= A Yeramba on display at the Royal Australian Armoured Corps Tank Museum In July 1949, approval was given to convert one Grant to the self-propelled configuration and the prototype subsequently underwent user and firing trials at Puckapunyal in December 1949. It was then returned to the factory for modifications and completion of the stowage arrangements. Following general acceptance by the Army, authorisation was given in February 1950 to convert another 13 Grants to Yerambas. The first of these conversions was completed in November 1950 and the last was delivered in August 1952. One of the benefits of the conversion was standardisation, as the Grant tank was still used by the 2nd Armoured Brigade itself, whilst the 25 pounder field gun was also the standard field artillery equipment in service. It was also the cheapest available solution. =Operational service= A group of officials inspecting the prototype Yeramba in 1949 A total of 14 vehicles underwent this conversion. Like many M3 medium tanks in Australia, the Yerambas were normally fitted with an additional cast armour plate of between 38 mm to 44 mm thickness bolted over the transmission housing and final drives on the nose of the vehicle. All of the Yerambas produced were issued to the 22nd Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery between 1950 and 1952 and based at Puckapunyal. The regiment subsequently adopted the Royal Australian Armoured Corps black beret with the Royal Australian Artillery cap badge, and were issued with AFV crewman's rubberised canvas soled boots. However, it was subsequently disbanded in 1957 and the Yerambas disposed of after being declared obsolete. They were never used operationally.Surviving Yerambas can be seen at the RAAC tank museum at Puckapunyal Victoria, and at the Melbourne Tank Museum in Narre Warren. Despite the gruelling labour associated with maintaining them, the Yeramba was considered a very good weapon by its crews.

It operates three special education schools Margaret Drive School (RCMDS), Yishun Park School (RCYPS) and a third one at Woodlands, for infants, children and youths with special needs like autism, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and multiple disabilities. The Margaret Drive School is located at 501 Margaret Drive, Singapore 149306 near Queenstown MRT station, while the Yishun Park School is located at 15 Yishun Street 61, Singapore 768548 near Khatib MRT station. Both schools currently run special education programmes and early intervention programmes. History Margaret Drive Special School started out in 1987 to cater to children with multiple handicaps. In 1989, the school introduced the programme called Structured Teaching for Exceptional Pupils (STEP) for autistic children aged between two and twelve years. In 1992, the Rainbow Centre was established, with Ee Peng Liang as the first Honorary Patron. In 1995, Rainbow Centre set up the Balestier Special School at NcNair Road as its second school, which was officially opened by Dr Wee Kim Wee on 1 October 1996. The Margaret Drive School later moved to a new purpose-built building with special facilities to cater to the needs of children with different learning difficulties. The building was officially opened by Aline Wong on 19 July 1999. A programme called Rainbow Link was launched in 2002 to promote volunteerism, through support, services and education. Rainbow Centre and Autism Resource Centre jointly started the Pathlight School in January 2004. This is an autism specific mainstream school for children with autism aged between six and sixteen years old. In 2006, in an attempt to prevent their students from being labelled, Margaret Drive Special School was renamed Rainbow Centre Margaret Drive School (RCMDS) and Balestier Special School was renamed Rainbow Centre Yishun Park School (RCYPS). In 2018, Rainbow Centre Yishun Park School (RCYPS) opened at 11 Marsiling Lane, Singapore 739148 in Woodlands. It is an interim site which took over the space previously occupied by Si Ling Secondary School. It will subsequently move to its purpose-built campus at Admiralty Link from 2022.

It is one of three symphonies he worked on in 1794, along with his 103 and 104th symphonies. Despite being lesser-known than many of the other works in the group, it is sometimes viewed as Haydn's best symphony, in terms of successful use of compositional strengths unified in a quality undisturbed throughout the work.  Background  It was completed in the summer of 1794, and premiered at benefit concerts at the King's Theatre in May 1795. It is now believed by many scholars to be the symphony at the premiere of which a chandelier fell from the ceiling of the concert hall in which it was performed. According to the Morning Chronicle (3rd February, 1795), ‚ÄúThe last movement was encored; and not withstanding an interruption by the accidental fall of one of the chandeliers, it was performed with no less effect.‚Äù The audience escaped unharmed, supposedly because they had rushed the stage to get a better view of Haydn.

They pose as children of Lieutenant Schmidt, a hero of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The main antihero of the novel, Ostap Bender, befriends two hapless members of this society. The novel is set in the Soviet Union (Russia, Ukraine and Turkestan) in the 1920s, and its premise is that at the time, numerous fake relatives of Karl Marx, Prince Kropotkin, and other revolutionary figures roam the country, tricking gullible Soviet officials into sponsoring them. Their numbers grow, and to prevent any unlucky chance of spoiling each other's attempts, they \\"unionize\\", with Schmidt's Children being the most difficult to organize. When the latter finally convene, \\"it turned out that Lieutenant Schmidt had thirty sons, from eighteen to fifty-two years in age, and four daughters, unattractive, and no longer young\\". They split Russia into 34 territories. Ostap Bender, being in difficult straits, decides to play the same game, but runs into another trickster (Shura Balaganov, who becomes his accomplice) right in front of a bureaucrat in a Soviet office.

Geography The ancient Minoan excavation site is 3 kilometers northeast of the Achladia village, south of Sitia. From the hill on which the houses stand, there is a view of the valley which drains into the Bay of Sitia, as well as the shoreline of the Ornon mountains' northeast spur. Archaeology Achladia was first excavated in 1939 by Nicolas Platon. He conducted subsequent excavations here in 1952 and 1959. The site is a large building with an area of 270 square meters referred to as House A and a smaller building nearby called House B. Two other Minoan buildings were also found nearby, but were only partially excavated. House A overlooks the entire bay of Siteia. There is some dispute about the period of use - Nicolas Platon believed that it was built during MMIII, but Lefteris Platon believes there is enough evidence to support the presence of a light well and polythyra (pier-and-door partition), both Late Minoan architectural features. If this is true, then the building would have been constructed during LMIB. Nearby are a LMIIIB tholos tomb at Platyskinos and a LMIII potter's kiln, which may add further contextual evidence for the site's Late Minoan chronology. Finds excavated from Achladia are at the Heraklion Archaeological Museum and Archaeological Museum of Sitia. =House A= House A consists of 12 excavated ground-floor rooms, and there is no evidence of an upper floor. Of particular note at the site are the pier-and-door partition connecting Rooms Beta and Gamma, a quern-stone in the kitchen (Room Delta) and a stone slab box in Room Gamma containing an agrimi rhyton. Evidence indicates that the Achladia buildings were destroyed in a violent earthquake.

It is located near the town of Exmouth on the north-west coast of Western Australia. RAAF Base Learmonth is one of the RAAF's three \\"bare bases\\". No RAAF units are currently based at Learmonth and it is maintained by a small caretaker staff during peacetime. The RAAF also operates the Learmonth Air Weapons Range which covers about and is located south-west of the airbase. History During World War II a little-known landing field was constructed on the western shore of Exmouth Gulf. It was code-named \\"Potshot\\" and maintained by No. 76 Operational Base Unit. In the 1950s the landing field was further developed as a military base and named RAAF Learmonth in honour of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth DFC and Bar, who, while leading No. 14 Squadron, was killed in a flying accident off Rottnest Island, Western Australia on 6 January 1944. Starting in June 1944, Qantas used Learmonth as an intermediate stop for two converted Consolidated Liberator bombers that flew a segment of the vital England‚ÄìAustralia air route, supplementing modified Consolidated PBY Catalinas flying The Double Sunrise route to Ceylon. The Liberators flew a shorter over-water route from Learmonth to an airfield northeast of Colombo, and could make the journey in 17 hours with of payload, whereas the Catalinas usually required at least 27 hours and had to carry so much auxiliary fuel that their payload was limited to only . The route was named Kangaroo Service and marked the first time that Qantas's now-famous kangaroo logo was used; passengers received a certificate proclaiming them as members of The Order of the Longest Hop. In the mid-1960s, the Federal Government gave its support to plans by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Val Hancock, to redevelop Learmonth as a 'bare base', due to its proximity to Indonesia. Though F-111Cs could have made a round-trip to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, from RAAF Base Darwin, the route they took would have been very much limited by range. Learmonth's relative proximity added flexibility to the routes in and out, enhancing the likelihood of a successful strike. The major work was undertaken by No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron between 1971 and 1973.

RAAF Base Woomera and the RAAF Woomera Test Range (WTR) are the two formations which make up the RAAF Woomera Range Complex (WRC). RAAF Base Woomera consists of two sectors, 'Base Sector North' which is a restricted access area and includes Camp Rapier. the entrance to the Woomera Test Range and the RAAF Woomera Airfield . 'Base Sector South' is accessible by the public and essentially encompasses that part of RAAF Base Woomera long referred to as the Woomera Village. Woomera Village is often quoted as a 'remote town'. It is not a 'town', but rather an 'open base' of the RAAF. The 'village' has previously always functioned as an Australian Government/Defence Force garrison facility until it was fully incorporated into RAAF Base Woomera in 2015.  Operations  RAAF Base Woomera is an operational Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) military airbase located within the RAAF Woomera Range Complex, situated approximately north of the base's \\"village\\" area, in South Australia, Australia. Officially established as an airbase with effect from January 2015, the RAAF Base Woomera comprises the Woomera airfield, hangars and technical areas as well as the Woomera Village. Operations and capability management of the entire Woomera Range Complex, is vested to Commander, Air Warfare Centre (CDR AWC), located at RAAF Base Edinburgh (Edinburgh, South Australia). Operational management of the RAAF Base Woomera formation is the joint responsibility of No. 20 Squadron (20SQN) and the Defence Estate and Infracture Group (E&IG;), supported by a Defence Contractor ( Broadspectrum). The role of the base is to provide operational and garrison support to Defence activities within the WRC. The RAAF Woomera Test Range formation of the Woomera Range Complex is managed by the AWC's Air Force Ranges Directorate (AFRD). The Air Force Test Ranges Squardron (AFTR SQN), is based out of RAAF Edinburgh, but they also maintain a permanent detachment based out of RAAF Base Woomera. The role of AFTR SQN is the day-to-day operation and management of the ranges within the WRC. RAAF Base Woomera is located approximately north of RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide). The Woomera Range Complex (WRC) is used as a specialised Defence systems test range supporting the defence of Australia. The Air Force, Department of Defence, and some State and Federal Government agencies (education, police etc.) maintain a number of full-time personnel at the base to support Defence activities at the WRC. The 2015 range proclamation states that the range may only be used for Defence related activities and that Defence access to, and use of the WRC will be managed through Headquarters, Air Warfare Centre at RAAF Base Edinburgh. Requests for Non-defence access to, and use (e.g. mining) of, the Woomera Prohibited Area (WPA), which is essentially the ground area that delineates the Woomera Range Complex, is managed through the 'Woomera Prohibited Area Coordination Office' (WPACO) in Canberra. Note: Aeronautical access requirements for RAAF Woomera aerodrome can be found in the 'On-route supplement Australia' (ERSA). The entry for Woomera states that landing approval is coordinated through the 20SQN Air Base Command Post (20SQN ABCP), but that civilian aircraft are not normally given permission to use the airfield unless such use is related to Defence activities at Woomera. RAAF Woomera is able to operate all current types of aircraft used by the Australian Defence Forces (ADF), including C-17 Globemasters and all fast-jet types. The airfield can be fitted with an arrestor cable system when required to bring it to normal RAAF operating standards for FA-18 Hornet operations. The airfield is also well able to handle larger aircraft types such as the C-5 Galaxy and Boeing 747. Large aircraft movements occur often at Woomera in support of ADF test and evaluation activities on the complex. Historical The centre line of the airfield was surveyed by Len Beadell in early 1947. A RAF Dakota was the first aircraft to use the field, as it landed at Woomera on 19 June 1947. It brought General Evetts and a party of British scientists to inspect the airfield which was recently completed. During 2015, all of the Woomera aerodrome aircraft parking aprons (4), taxiways and the main runway, were all refurbised in $40M upgrade. In 2016, through public tender, a significant repair was made to Hangar 1, and in 2018 the airmovements terminal was refurbished and a new secure-storage facility built. A new connecting road between the magazine area (west of the airfield) and the northern end of the main runway was constructed. A new security control gate facility is under construction (2018) approximately 1 km north of Woomera Village, at the entrance to Base Sector North of RAAF Base Woomera. The first control tower at the Woomera Test Range originally came from RAAF Base Uranquinty, New South Wales. The tower was disassembled by No. 2 Airfield Construction Squadron in the late 1940s and shipped to Woomera, where it was re-erected and reopened in the early 1950s at Evetts Field. The main control tower at Woomera aerodrome was constructed in 1953 and is still active. In 2016 the Department of Defence announced plans to replace the control cabin and an upgrade to all communications, electrical, mechanical and hydraulic services to the building in order to comply with building code requirements. =Evetts Field= Evetts Field (AU09) is a satellite airfield located north-west of the RAAF Base Woomera within the RAAF Woomera Range Complex. On 15 May 1951 Koolymilka airfield was officially named Evetts Field in honour of Lieutenant General John Fullerton Evetts, who led the English party that selected the Woomera site for the Anglo-Australian Long Range Weapons Establishment, and handed over to the Department of Supply. Evetts Field is now only semi operational, mostly used as an emergency runway for the Flying Doctor and for RAAF operations. It features two runways, each long. Evetts Field was used for launching the Jindivik target drone from 31 October 1950 to June 1975. The airfield was virtually abandoned in the 1970s, with its control tower and other buildings sold off and removed. The two runways are now in poor condition.

It suggests that we perform an averaging over a given amount of time in order to iron out the fast oscillations and observe the qualitative behavior from the resulting dynamics. The approximated solution holds under finite time inversely proportional to the parameter denoting the slow time scale. It turns out to be a customary problem where there exists the trade off between how good is the approximated solution balanced by how much time it holds to be close to the original solution. More precisely, the system has the following form\\\\quad \\\\dot{x} = \\\\varepsilon f( x,t , \\\\varepsilon ), \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon \\\\ll 1of a phase space variable x.The fast oscillation is given by f versus a slow drift of \\\\dot{x}.

Under the validity of this averaging technique, the asymptotic behavior of the original system is captured by the dynamical equation for y. In this way, qualitative methods for autonomous dynamical systems may be employed to analyze the equilibria and more complex structures, such as slow manifold and invariant manifolds, as well as their stability in the phase space of the averaged system. In addition, in a physical application it might be reasonable or natural to replace a mathematical model, which is given in the form of the diÔ¨Äerential equation for \\\\dot{x} , with the corresponding averaged system \\\\dot{y}, in order to use the averaged system to make a prediction and then test the prediction against the results of a physical experiment. The averaging method has a long history, which is deeply rooted in perturbation problems that arose in celestial mechanics (see, for example in ).  First example  Figure 1: Solution to perturbed logistic growth equation \\\\dot {x} = \\\\varepsilon (x (1 - x) + \\\\sin{t}) ~ x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, ~\\\\varepsilon = 0.05 (blue solid line) and the averaged equation \\\\dot {y} = \\\\varepsilon y (1 - y),~ y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} (orange solid line). Consider a perturbed logistic growth\\\\quad \\\\dot {x} = \\\\varepsilon (x (1 - x) + \\\\sin{t}) \\\\quad \\\\quad x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon \\\\ll 1,and the averaged equation\\\\quad \\\\dot {y} = \\\\varepsilon y (1 - y) \\\\qquad y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. The purpose of the method of averaging is to tell us the qualitative behavior of the vector field when we average it over a period of time. It guarantees that the solution y(t) approximates x(t) for times t = \\\\mathcal{O}(1/\\\\varepsilon).Exceptionally: in this example the approximation is even better, it is valid for all times. We present it in a section below.  Definitions  We assume the vector fieldf:\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^nto be of differentiability class C^{r} with r \\\\geq 2(or even we will only say smooth), which we will denote f \\\\in C^r(\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{+}; \\\\mathbb{R}^n). We expand this time-dependent vector field in Taylor (in orders of \\\\varepsilon) with remainder. We introduce the following notation:\\\\quad f(x, t, \\\\varepsilon) = f^0(x, t) + \\\\varepsilon f^{1}(x, t) + \\\\dots + \\\\varepsilon^k f^{k}(x, t) + \\\\varepsilon^{k + 1} f^{[k + 1]}(x, t, \\\\varepsilon), where f^{j} = \\\\frac{f^{(j)}(x, t, 0)}{j!} is the j-th derivative with 0 \\\\leq j \\\\leq k. As we are concerned with averaging problems, in general f^0(x, t)is zero, so it turns out that we will be interested to vector fields given by\\\\quad f(x, t, \\\\varepsilon) = \\\\varepsilon f^{[1]}(x, t, \\\\varepsilon) = \\\\varepsilon f^{1}(x, t) + \\\\varepsilon^{2} f^{[2]}(x, t, \\\\varepsilon).Besides, we define the following initial value problem to be in the standard form:\\\\quad \\\\dot{x} = \\\\varepsilon f^{1}(x, t) + \\\\varepsilon^{2} f^{[2]}(x, t, \\\\varepsilon), \\\\qquad x(0, \\\\varepsilon) =: x_0 \\\\in D \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon \\\\ll 1.  Theorem: averaging in the periodic case  Consider for every D \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n connected and bounded and every \\\\varepsilon_0 > 0 there exist L > 0 and \\\\varepsilon \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon_0 such that the original system (a non-autonomous dynamical system) given by\\\\quad \\\\dot{x} = \\\\varepsilon f^{1}(x, t) + \\\\varepsilon^{2} f^{[2]}(x, t, \\\\varepsilon), \\\\qquad x_0 \\\\in D \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon \\\\ll 1,has solution x(t, \\\\varepsilon), where f^1 \\\\in C^r(D \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}; \\\\mathbb{R}^n) is periodic with period T and f^{[2]} \\\\in C^r(D \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{+}; \\\\mathbb{R}^n) both with r \\\\geq 2 bounded on bounded sets. Then there exists a constant c > 0 such that the solution y(t, \\\\varepsilon) of the averaged system (autonomous dynamical system) is\\\\quad \\\\dot{y}= \\\\varepsilon {\\\\frac {1}{T}}\\\\int _{0}^{T}f^1(y, s)~ds =: \\\\varepsilon{\\\\bar {f}}^1(y), \\\\quad y(0, \\\\varepsilon) = x_0is\\\\quad \\\\x(t, \\\\varepsilon) - y(t, \\\\varepsilon)\\\\ < c \\\\varepsilonfor 0 \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon_0 and 0 \\\\leq t \\\\leq L/\\\\varepsilon. = Remarks = * There are two approximations in this what is called first approximation estimate: reduction to the average of the vector field and negligence of \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\varepsilon^2) terms. * Uniformity with respect to the initial condition x_0: if we vary x_0 this affects the estimation of L and c . The proof and discussion of this can be found in J. Murdock's book. * Reduction of regularity: there is a more general form of this theorem which requires only f^1 to be Lipschitz and f^{[2]} continuous. It is a more recent proof and can be seen in Sanders et al.. The theorem statement presented here is due to the proof framework proposed by Krylov-Bogoliubov which is based on an introduction of a near-identity transformation. The advantage of this method is the extension to more general settings such as infinite-dimensional systems - partial differential equation or delay differential equations. *J. Hale presents generalizations to almost periodic vector-fields. = Strategy of the proof = Krylov-Bogoliubov realized that the slow dynamics of the system determines the leading order of the asymptotic solution. In order to proof it, they proposed a near-identity transformation, which turned out to be a change of coordinates with its own time-scale transforming the original system to the averaged one.  Sketch of the proof  # Determination of a near-identity transformation: the smooth mapping y \\\\mapsto U(y, t, \\\\varepsilon) = y + \\\\varepsilon u^{[1]}(y, t, \\\\varepsilon)where u^{[1]} is assumed to be regular enough and T periodic. The proposed change of coordinates is given by x = U(y, t, \\\\varepsilon). # Choose an appropriate u^{[1]} solving the homological equation of the averaging theory: \\\\frac{\\\\partial u^{[1]}}{\\\\partial t} = f^{1}(y, t) - \\\\bar{f}^1(y). #Change of coordinates carries the original system to \\\\dot{y} = \\\\varepsilon \\\\bar{f}^1(y) + \\\\varepsilon^2 f_{*}^{[2]}(y, t, \\\\varepsilon). # Estimation of error due to truncation and comparison to the original variable.  Non-autonomous class of systems: more examples  Along the history of the averaging technique, there is class of system extensively studied which give us meaningful examples we will discuss below. The class of system is given by: \\\\quad \\\\ddot{z} + z = \\\\varepsilon g(z, \\\\dot{z}, t), \\\\qquad z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R},\\\\quad z(0) = z_0 ~\\\\mathrm{ and }~ \\\\dot{z}(0) = v_0, where g is smooth. This system is similar to a linear system with a small nonlinear perturbation given by \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varepsilon ~g(z, \\\\dot{z}, t) \\\\end{bmatrix}: \\\\quad \\\\begin{aligned} \\\\dot{z_1} &= z_2, & z_1(0) &= z_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z_2} &= -z_1 + \\\\varepsilon g(z_1, z_2, t), & z_2(0) &= v_0, \\\\end{aligned} differing from the standard form. Hence there is a necessity to perform a transformation to make it in the standard form explicitly. We are able to change coordinates using variation of constants method. We look at the unperturbed system, i.e. \\\\varepsilon = 0, given by \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{z_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z_2} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} z_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} = A \\\\begin{bmatrix} z_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} which has the fundamental solution \\\\Phi(t) = e^{A t}corresponding to a rotation. Then the time-dependent change of coordinates is z(t) = \\\\Phi(t) x where x is the coordinates respective to the standard form. If we take the time derivative in both sides and invert the fundamental matrix we obtain \\\\quad \\\\dot{x} = \\\\varepsilon e^{- A t} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ ~\\\\tilde g(x, \\\\dot{x}, t) \\\\end{bmatrix} ~\\\\text{ with }~ \\\\tilde g(x, \\\\dot{x}, t)=g(\\\\cos(t)x(t)+\\\\sin(t)\\\\dot x(t), -\\\\sin(t)x(t)+\\\\cos(t)\\\\dot x(t), t). = Remarks = * The same can be done to time-dependent linear parts. Although the fundamental solution may be non-trivial to write down explicitly, the procedure is similar. See Sanders et al. for further details. * If the eigenvalues of Aare not all purely imaginary this is called hyperbolicity condition. For this occasion, the perturbation equation may present some serious problems even whether gis bounded, since the solution grows exponentially fast. However, qualitatively, we may be able to know the asymptotic solution, such as Hartman-Grobman results and more. * Occasionally in order to obtain standard forms which are easier to work on, we may choose a rotating reference frame set of coordinates - polar coordinates - given by z_1 = r \\\\sin(t - \\\\phi) ~\\\\mathrm{and}~ z_2 = r \\\\cos(t - \\\\phi) which determines the initial condition (r(0), \\\\phi(0)) as well, and defines system: \\\\quad \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{r} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\phi} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\varepsilon \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(t - \\\\phi) g(r \\\\sin(t - \\\\phi), r \\\\cos(t - \\\\phi), t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\sin(t - \\\\phi) g(r \\\\sin(t - \\\\phi), r \\\\cos(t - \\\\phi), t) \\\\end{bmatrix}. If g \\\\in C^1we average it as long as a neighborhood of the origin is excluded (since the polar coordinates fail) yields:\\\\quad \\\\begin{array}{lcr} \\\\bar{f}_1^1(r) = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2 \\\\pi} \\\\cos(s - \\\\phi) g(r \\\\sin (s - \\\\phi), r \\\\cos(s - \\\\phi), s) d s \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar{f}_2^1(r) = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi r} \\\\int_0^{2 \\\\pi} \\\\sin(s - \\\\phi) g(r \\\\sin (s - \\\\phi), r \\\\cos(s - \\\\phi), s) d s, \\\\end{array} where the averaged system is\\\\quad \\\\begin{array}{lcr} \\\\dot{\\\\bar{r}} = \\\\varepsilon \\\\bar{f}_1^1 (\\\\bar{r}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\bar{\\\\phi}} = \\\\varepsilon \\\\bar{f}_2^1 (\\\\bar{r}) \\\\end{array}. = Example: Misleading averaging results = Figure 2: A simple harmonic oscillator with small periodic damping term given by \\\\ddot{z} + 4 \\\\varepsilon \\\\cos^2{(t)} \\\\dot{z} + z = 0, ~ z(0) = 0,~ \\\\dot{z}(0) = 1;~\\\\varepsilon = 0.05.The numerical simulation of the original equation (blue solid line) is compared with averaging system (orange dashed line) and the crude averaged system (green dash-dotted line). The left plot displays the solution evolved in time and the right plot represents on the phase space. We note that the crude averaging disagrees with the expected solution. The method contains some assumptions and restrictions. These limitations play important role when we average the original equation which is not into the standard form, and we can discuss counterexample of it. The following example in order to discourage this hurried averaging: \\\\quad \\\\ddot{z} + 4 \\\\varepsilon \\\\cos^2{(t)} \\\\dot{z} + z = 0, \\\\quad \\\\quad z(0) = 0,\\\\quad \\\\dot{z}(0) = 1, where we put g(z, \\\\dot{z}, t) = - 4\\\\cos^2(t) \\\\dot{z}following the previous notation. This systems corresponds to a damped harmonic oscillator where the damping term oscillates between 0 and 4\\\\varepsilon. Averaging the friction term over one cycle of 2 \\\\pi yields the equation: \\\\quad \\\\ddot{\\\\bar{z}} + 2 \\\\varepsilon \\\\dot{\\\\bar{z}} + \\\\bar{z} = 0, \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\bar{z}(0) = 0, \\\\quad \\\\dot{\\\\bar{z}}(0) = 1. The solution is\\\\bar{z}(t) = \\\\frac{1}{(1 - \\\\varepsilon^2)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}} e^{- \\\\varepsilon t} \\\\sin{((1 - \\\\varepsilon^2)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}t)}.which the convergence rate to the origin is \\\\varepsilon. The averaged system obtained from the standard form yields:\\\\quad \\\\begin{array}{lcr} \\\\dot{\\\\bar{r}} = - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\varepsilon \\\\bar{r}(2 + \\\\cos(2 \\\\bar{\\\\phi})), ~\\\\bar{r}(0) = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\bar{\\\\phi}} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\varepsilon \\\\sin(2 \\\\bar{\\\\phi}), ~\\\\bar{\\\\phi}(0) = 0, \\\\end{array} which in the rectangular coordinate shows explicitly that indeed the rate of convergence to the origin is \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\varepsilondiffering from the previous crude averaged system: \\\\quad y(t) = e^{-\\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\varepsilon t} \\\\sin{t} = Example: Van der Pol Equation = Figure 3: Phase space of a Van der Pol oscillator with \\\\varepsilon = 0.1. The stable limit cycle (orange solid line) in the system is captured correctly by the qualitative analysis of the averaged system. For two different initial conditions ( black dots ) we observe the trajectories.(dashed blue line) converging to the periodic orbit. Van der Pol was concerned with obtaining approximate solution for equations of the type \\\\quad \\\\ddot{z} + \\\\varepsilon (1 - z^2) \\\\dot{z} + z = 0, where g(z, \\\\dot{z}, t) = (1 - z^2) \\\\dot{z}following the previous notation. This system is named Van der Pol oscillator. If we apply periodic averaging to this nonlinear oscillator, this give us qualitative knowledge of the phase space without solving explicitly the system. The averaged system is\\\\quad \\\\begin{array}{lcr} \\\\dot{\\\\bar{r}} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\varepsilon \\\\bar{r}(1 - \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\bar{r}^2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\bar{\\\\phi}} = 0, \\\\end{array} and we can analyze the fixed points and their stability. There is an unstable fixed point at the origin and a stable limit cycle represented by \\\\bar{r} = 2 . The existence of such stable limit- cycle can be stated as a theorem. Theorem (Existence of a periodic orbit): If p_0is a hyperbolic fixed point of \\\\quad \\\\dot{y}= \\\\varepsilon {\\\\bar {f}}^1(y)Then there exists \\\\varepsilon_0 > 0such that for all 0 < \\\\varepsilon < \\\\varepsilon_0, \\\\quad \\\\dot{x} = \\\\varepsilon f^{1}(x, t) + \\\\varepsilon^{2} f^{[2]}(x, t, \\\\varepsilon)has a unique hyperbolic periodic orbit \\\\gamma_{\\\\varepsilon}(t) = p_0 + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\varepsilon)of the same stability type as p_0. The proof can be found at Guckenheimer and Holmes, Sanders et al. and for the angle case in Chicone. = Example: Restricting the time interval = Figure 4: The plot depicts two fundamental quantities the average technique is based on: the bounded and connected region D of the phase space and how long (defined by the constant c) the averaged solution is valid. For this case, \\\\ddot{z} + z = 8 \\\\varepsilon \\\\cos{(t)} \\\\dot{z}^2 , ~ z(0) = 0,~ \\\\dot{z}(0) = 1;~ 8 \\\\varepsilon = \\\\frac{2}{15} . Note that both solutions blow up in finite time. Hence, D has been chosen accordingly in order to maintain the boundedness of the solution and the time interval of validity of the approximation is 0 \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon t < L < \\\\frac{1}{3}. The average theorem assumes existence of a connected and bounded region D \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^nwhich affects the time interval L of the result validity. The following example points it out. Consider the\\\\quad \\\\ddot{z} + z = 8 \\\\varepsilon \\\\cos{(t)} \\\\dot{z}^2 , ~ z(0) = 0,~ \\\\dot{z}(0) = 1, where g(z, \\\\dot{z}, t) = 8 \\\\dot{z}^2 \\\\cos(t). The averaged system consists of\\\\quad \\\\begin{array}{lcr} \\\\dot{\\\\bar{r}} = 3 \\\\varepsilon \\\\bar{r}^2\\\\cos(\\\\bar{\\\\phi}), ~\\\\bar{r}(0) = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\bar{\\\\phi}} = -\\\\varepsilon \\\\bar{r} \\\\sin(\\\\bar{\\\\phi}), ~\\\\bar{\\\\phi}(0) = 0, \\\\end{array} which under this initial condition indicates that the original solution behaves like\\\\quad z(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\sin(t)}{1 - 3 \\\\varepsilon t} + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\varepsilon), where it holds on a bounded region over 0 \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon t \\\\leq L < \\\\frac{1}{3} . = Damped Pendulum = Consider a damped pendulum whose point of suspension is vibrated vertically by a small amplitude, high frequency signal (this is usually known as dithering). The equation of motion for such a pendulum is given by m(l\\\\ddot{\\\\theta} - ak\\\\omega^2 \\\\sin \\\\omega t \\\\sin \\\\theta) = -mg \\\\sin \\\\theta - k(l\\\\dot{\\\\theta} + a\\\\omega \\\\cos \\\\omega t \\\\sin \\\\theta) where a \\\\sin \\\\omega t describes the motion of the suspension point, k describes the damping of the pendulum, and \\\\theta is the angle made by the pendulum with the vertical. The phase space form of this equation is given by \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot t &= 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot\\\\theta &= p \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot p &= \\\\frac{1}{ml} (mak\\\\omega^2 \\\\sin\\\\omega t \\\\sin \\\\theta - mg\\\\sin\\\\theta - k(l p + a\\\\omega \\\\cos\\\\omega t \\\\sin \\\\theta)) \\\\end{align} where we have introduced the variable p and written the system as an autonomous, first-order system in (t, \\\\theta, p)-space. Suppose that the angular frequency of the vertical vibrations, \\\\omega, is much greater than the natural frequency of the pendulum, \\\\sqrt{ g/l }. Suppose also that the amplitude of the vertical vibrations, a, is much less than the length l of the pendulum. The pendulum's trajectory in phase space will trace out a spiral around a curve C, moving along C at the slow rate \\\\sqrt{ g/l } but moving around it at the fast rate \\\\omega. The radius of the spiral around C will be small and proportional to a. The average behaviour of the trajectory, over a timescale much larger than 2\\\\pi/\\\\omega, will be to follow the curve C.  Extension error estimates  Average technique for initial value problems has been treated up to now with an validity error estimates of order 1/\\\\varepsilon. However, there are circumstances where the estimates can be extended for further times, even the case for all times. Below we deal with a system containing an asymptotically stable fixed point. Such situation recapitulates what is illustrated in Figure 1. Theorem (Eckhaus /Sanchez- Palencia ) Consider the initial value problem\\\\quad \\\\dot{x} = \\\\varepsilon f^{1}(x, t), \\\\qquad x_0 \\\\in D \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon \\\\ll 1.Suppose \\\\quad \\\\dot{y}= \\\\varepsilon \\\\lim_{T \\\\to \\\\infty}{\\\\frac {1}{T}}\\\\int _{0}^{T}f^1(y, s)~ds =: \\\\varepsilon{\\\\bar {f}}^1(y), \\\\quad y(0, \\\\varepsilon) = x_0exists and contains an asymptotically stable fixed point y = 0 in the linear approximation. Moreover, \\\\bar{f}^1is continuously differentiable with respect to y in D and has a domain of attraction D^0 \\\\subset D. For any compact K \\\\subset D^0 there exists a c > 0 such that for all a \\\\in K \\\\quad \\\\x(t) - y(t)\\\\ = \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\delta(\\\\varepsilon)), \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq t < \\\\infty, with \\\\delta(\\\\varepsilon) = o(1)in the general case and \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\varepsilon) in the periodic case.

It appears in Greek literature and mythology from the earliest times, but its origin is far earlier, in prehistory. The historic settlement belonged to a civilization now called Minoan. Excavation at Amnisos in 1932 uncovered a villa that included the \\"House of the Lilies\\", which was named for the lily theme that was depicted in a wall fresco.  Geography  Amnisos is 7 km east of Heraklion (Iraklio) on a beach used for recreation by the citizens of the modern city. The current sea level is three meters higher than the bronze-aged sea level. Drowned houses are visible. The ancient settlement bears the same name as the river exiting there. Currently called the Karteros, from the iron-aged name of Caeratus, the river was the Amnisos during the Bronze Age. Across from its mouth is a very small island called Amnisos. The river begins on Mount Ida in central Crete and runs through Karteros Ravine. During the drier season, the river is reduced to a stream. The divinities, Amnisiades, were associated with the river. There was no navigable stream to Knossos, today part of the port city. The road was lined with very ancient cult sites. One site is the cave of the goddess Eileithyia. It contained objects dating as far back as the neolithic period.  Archaeology  The \\"House of the Lilies\\". Amnisos was first excavated in 1932 by Spyridon Marinatos, who discovered the villa and \\"The House of Lilies\\", which was named for the only restorable fresco. The two-storeyed villa had ten rooms and included a paved court, a hall with a polythyra, a kitchen area, a shrine, and a bathroom. The restored 1.8-meter- high lily fresco on the second storey depicts red and white lilies, mint, iris, and papyrus growing in pots. Concerning the date, MatzWork cited, Chapter 3, The Age of Maturity. has this to say: :\\"The blossoms ... are inlaid with coloured paste on a ruby ground, by a method similar to that used for inlaying intarsia. This is a rare technical process. Dating is made possible by concurrence with vases originating from a Late MM IIIa level.\\"Matz cites a vase with lily design from Knossos dated to approximately 1600 BCE. If it is on the border between the middle Bronze Age (Middle Minoan, MM) and the late Bronze Age (Late Minoan, LM), then the fresco is an early instance of a typical style in the early period of the late Bronze Age, LMIA, or \\"Palace Period.\\" Often termed the \\"naturalistic style\\", it flourished ca. 1570-1470 BCE. In it are stylized motifs from nature, especially floral, and courtly scenes. The original colors of red, blue, yellow, and black were bright. The house was destroyed by fire during LMIA.  Bronze-Aged history  Amnisos is mentioned in a few Linear B tablets, mainly from Knossos, as , a-mi-ni-so, reconstructed to *Amnisos. An example is tablet KN Gg 705 quoted by Ventris and Chadwick:Work cited, Page 310. > Amnisos: One jar of honey to Eleuthia, :One jar of honey to all [of] the > gods. . . . The tablet records a votive offering from or at Amnisos to the goddess of childbirth, probably the one worshipped at the cave mentioned above. The word \\"a-mi-ni-so\\" was pivotal in Michael Ventris' deciphering of Linear B. Ventris had constructed elaborate tables with possible phonemic values for the syllabary's symbols and had correctly identified key grammatical features such as declensional suffixes. He then made the crucial educated guess that a particular word referred to Amnisos, the port of Knossos. The guess proved an inspired one, as it was correct and let all the other pieces of the puzzle fall into place. The date of the Knossos tablets is still uncertain,The original issue was called the Palmer-Boardman Dispute and concerned Arthur Evans' dating of the layer, in which the tablets were found, to ca. 1400 BCE rather than to the 1200 BCE of the Pylos tablets. but it is likely that they belong to the late Bronze Age. Amnisos is mentioned on the itinerary published on the statue base of Amenophis III at Kom el-Heitan, as an ambassadorial stop to Keftiu (Crete), dated ca. 1380 BCE. By that date, the residents of Knossos and almost certainly of its port, Amnisos, were speaking Greek. In the thumbnail historical sketch given by John Chadwick in The Mycenaean World, Chapter 1, Chadwick writes: > Crete was occupied down to the fifteenth century by people who did not speak > Greek... Instead, they spoke the language that was written in the yet undeciphered script called Linear A. These people, called Minoans by Arthur Evans, were extremely influential at sea: > Around the sixteenth century the Minoan influence on the mainland becomes > very marked. During this floruit, the House of Lilies was occupied. Minoan civilization is not believed to have been warlike; there are few traces of arms and armor. They probably represented a mercantile hegemony, safe in their island home and protected by their fleet. Around 1450 BCE, the villa was burned along with all of the other major sites in Crete except for Knossos. These events are generally interpreted as an interest in ruling the island by Mycenaean Greeks. As the name Amnisos evidences the pre-Greek -ssos suffix, they probably took the name as it was. Archaic and Classical history Amnisos was noted in ancient Greek history, noted by several authors. It was described as the harbour of Knossos, and was situated at the mouth of a river also named Amnisos. It possessed a sanctuary of Eileithyia, and the nymphs of the river, called Amnisabes (·ºàŒºŒΩŒπœÉŒπŒ¨Œ≤ŒµœÇ) and Amnisides (·ºàŒºŒΩŒπœÉŒØŒ¥ŒµœÇ), were sacred to this goddess.Apollon. 3.877; Callim.

It is the second of three Sinbad films released by Columbia Pictures, the others being The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958) and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977). The film stars John Phillip Law, Tom Baker, Takis Emmanuel and Caroline Munro. It won the first Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film. Plot While sailing, Sinbad comes across a golden tablet dropped by a mysterious flying creature. That night, he dreams about a man dressed in black, repeatedly calling his name, as well as a beautiful girl with an eye tattooed on the palm of her right hand. A sudden storm throws the ship off course and Sinbad and his men find themselves near a coastal town in the country of Marabia. Swimming to the beach, he encounters the man from his dream, Prince Koura, who demands that he turn over the amulet. Sinbad narrowly escapes into the city, where he meets the Grand Vizier of Marabia, who has been acting as regent following the death of the sultan, who had no heir. The Vizier, who wears a golden mask to hide his disfigured face, explains that Sinbad's amulet is but one piece of a puzzle, of which the Vizier has another. The Vizier relates to Sinbad a legend, which claims that the three pieces, when joined together, will reveal a map showing the way to the fabled Fountain of Destiny on the lost continent of Lemuria. He who takes the three pieces to the Fountain will receive \\"youth, a shield of darkness and a crown of untold riches.\\" Sinbad agrees to help the Vizier in his quest for the Fountain and they join forces against the evil Prince Koura, a magician bent on using the Fountain's gifts to conquer Marabia. Koura had previously locked the Vizier in a room and set it on fire, resulting in the disfiguring of the Vizier's face. The creature that dropped the gold tablet was Koura's minion, a homunculus created by his black magic. Koura uses the creature to spy on Sinbad and the Vizier and learn of their plans. Shortly afterwards, Sinbad meets the woman in his dream, a slave girl named Margiana. Her master hires Sinbad to make a man out of his lazy, no-good son Haroun. Sinbad agrees on the condition that Margiana come along. Koura hires a ship and a crew of his own and follows Sinbad, using his magic several times to try to stop Sinbad. However, each attempt drains away part of his life force, and he ages noticeably each time. On his journey, Sinbad encounters numerous perils, including a wooden siren figurehead on his own ship, animated by Koura's magic, which manages to steal the map, enabling Koura to locate Lemuria. The wizard uses another homunculus to overhear the Oracle of All Knowledge describe to Sinbad what he will face in his search for the Fountain. Koura seals the men inside the Oracle's cave, but Sinbad uses a makeshift rope to get everyone out. Haroun manages to destroy the homunculus as it attacks Sinbad. After he is captured by hostile natives, Koura animates a six-armed statue of Kali, causing the natives to set him free. Sinbad and his men arrive soon after. They fight and defeat Kali as she falls and breaks apart and find the final piece of the puzzle within Kali's shattered remains. The natives capture Sinbad and his crew, but after they see the eye tattoo on Margiana's hand, they instead decide to sacrifice her to a one-eyed centaur, the natives' God of the Single Eye and the Fountain's Guardian of Evil. Koura arrives at the Fountain of Destiny. When he drops the first piece of the tablet into the Fountain, his life force is restored. He then summons the centaur, which fights the Fountain's Guardian of Good, a griffin. Meanwhile, Sinbad and the others escape, rescue Margiana and reach the Fountain. They watch as the centaur kills the griffin with Koura's aid, then Sinbad slays the centaur. Koura drops the second piece into the Fountain, which turns him invisible (the \\"shield of darkness\\"). He engages Sinbad in a swordfight. Sinbad is barely able to fend off his invisible foe, but Koura makes a fatal mistake by stepping in the Fountain itself, which reveals his silhouette, enabling Sinbad to kill him. Sinbad then drops in the third piece, and a jewel-encrusted crown rises from the depths. He gives the crown to the Vizier. When the Vizier dons the crown, his mask dissolves, revealing his restored, unscarred face. Their quest completed, Sinbad and his crew journey back to Marabia. When Margiana asks him why he did not take the crown himself, Sinbad explains, \\"I value freedom. A king is never really free. Why, he's even told who he must marry.\\" The two of them kiss. Haroun, hanging on a rope above, asks Sinbad if he will take him on as a fully fledged seamen now. Sinbad agrees but tells Haroun to make fast with the rope. Haroun replies, \\"Don't worry Captain, I trust in Allahhhhh\\" just as the rope becomes loose, hurtling him downward. The rope becomes taut again leaving Haroun dangling in mid air just short of hitting the deck. Sinbad and the Vizier finish the old Arab saying Haroun started, \\" But tie up your camel!\\" They all laugh as the ship sails away into the sunset. Cast * John Phillip Law as Sinbad, the protagonist * Tom Baker as Prince Koura, the main antagonist of the film (Christopher Lee was a front-runner to play Koura) Baker's performance helped him get the lead role of the Fourth Doctor in the TV series Doctor Who, because the show's producer, Barry Letts, was impressed with his performance.Doctor Who the Handbook: The Fourth Doctor Doctor Who Books, 1992, pg 43. * Takis Emmanuel as Achmed (Emmanuel was dubbed by Robert Rietti) * Caroline Munro as Margiana (Munro was well known at the time for being featured in advertisements for Lamb's Navy Rum) * Douglas Wilmer as the Grand Vizier of Marabia * Gr√©goire Aslan as Hakim (as Gregoire Aslan) * David Garfield as Abdul (as John D.

Retrieved on 9 August 2013. Production Producer Charles Schneer and actress Caroline Munro in Amsterdam for the premiere of The Golden Voyage of Sinbad. Schneer said he and Harryhausen chose to do another Sinbad movie as they \\"felt it was time to go back to the Arabian Nights, since no one else has been dealing with it and we had a great success with it in the late fifties. We felt there was a new audience that was ready for it. We knew of no other producers who were considering this type of material, largely because they probably didn‚Äôt know how to handle it on a basis where it became economically viable.\\"Cinefantastique p 42 Harryhausen did a dozen master sketches which, Schneer said \\"we felt would bo intriguing and interesting and characteristic of the period.\\" They then hired Brian Clemens to do a screenplay based on the sketches. Harryhausen was given a co producer credit in this film to reflect his greater involvement in the writing, editing and casting process. Schneer says Law was cast at the suggestion of Columbia. \\"He wasn't very athletic, and he didn't handle a sword as well as Kerwin did,\\" said the producer. \\"Frankly, he was kind of flat-footed, but he did the best he could. He used a Middle Eastern accent that I wasn't altogether pleased about, either.\\" Caroline Munro was given the female lead. Schneer said \\"We wanted her to project that sex appeal, because that was what was happening at the time in the film business. But we were still making a G-rated picture, so we went for G-rated sex appeal.\\" Producers Charles Schneer and Ray Harryhausen based their production in Spain (Madrid as well as the island of Majorca) to take advantage of the local rugged scenery. At one point the possibility of filming some scenes at the landmark Alhambra palace in Granada was raised; however, rental fees demanded by local authorities proved prohibitive. Eventually the company was able to film at the Royal Palace of La Almudaina. Other scenes were done in the Caves of Art√† (the temple of the Oracle) and the Torrent de Pareishttp://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie;=67592 It was filmed from June 19, 1972 to August 1972. An early charcoal/pencil illustration showed the one-eyed centaur battling a giant Neanderthal-like creature, who was later ultimately replaced by a griffin in the final version. The idea of the Neanderthal was later featured in Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977).Dalton, Tony. The Art of Ray Harryhuasen. London: Aurum, 2005, pg 178.

On 31 January 1838, Lord Glenelg, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies sent Governor Gipps the report. The office of Chief Protector of Aborigines was established in some states, and in Queensland the title was Protector of Aboriginals. The office of Protector was by appointment, by the Aboriginal Protection Board (or similar). The report recommended that Protectors of Aborigines should be engaged. They would be required to learn the Aboriginal language and their duties would be to watch over the rights of Indigenous Australians (mostly Aboriginal, but also Torres Strait Islander people), guard against encroachment on their property and to protect them from acts of cruelty, oppression and injustice. The Port Phillip Protectorate was established with George Augustus Robinson as chief protector and four full- time protectors. While the role was nominally to protect Aboriginal people, particularly in remote areas, the role included social control up to the point of controlling whom individuals were able to marry and where they lived and managing their financial affairs. A. O. Neville was a notable Protector in Western Australia. Matthew Moorhouse was the first Protector of Aborigines in South Australia. He led the Rufus River massacre, which slaughtered 30 to 40 Aboriginal people. The Aborigines Welfare Board in New South Wales was abolished in 1969.

It is located on the banks of the Yarra River beside and under the Flinders Street Viaduct and the King Street Bridge. The attraction is a Sea Life Centre owned by Merlin Entertainments. History The current building was built between February 1998 and December 1999, the building was designed by Peddle Thorp architects to resemble a ship moored to the river, and opened in January 2000. The depth of the building however was designed not to be imposing at street level, and extends below the surface. At its centre is a world first 'oceanarium in the round' where the spectators become the spectacle to the marine life swimming around them. Soon after opening, the building had a legionnaires disease outbreak that resulted in 2 deaths and another 60 people being affected. Those affected had visited the aquarium between 11 and 27 April 2000. A damages action was brought in May 2000, ending in February 2004. On 28 November 2008 Melbourne Aquarium officially opened after a significant expansion, also designed by Peddle Thorp, and now extends from the Yarra River to Flinders Street. A new entrance was built on the corner of Flinders and King Streets. The expansion features exhibits with king penguins and gentoo penguins, as well as many Antarctic fish, a first for Australia. The exhibits also feature real ice and snow to simulate Antarctic conditions, and take visitors on an expedition to Antarctica. The penguins were sourced from Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World in New Zealand. In April 2013, Melbourne Aquarium's owners, Merlin Entertainments, announced that they would be spending $8 million on the refurbishment of the facilities. As part of the process, the aquarium will be rebranded as a Sea Life Centre and relaunched in September 2013. The current Aquarium succeeded an earlier site in the Eastern annex of the Royal Exhibition Building, which burned down in 1953.

Research and conservation Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium conducts extensive research into marine species, with the Aquarium's conservation efforts overseen by the Turtle Rehabilitation and Conservation of Keystone Species (T.R.A.C.K.S.) group, a subsidiary of the Sea Life Conservation Trust. *Grey nurse sharks. Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium is involved in a grey nurse shark breeding program in conjunction with Sea Life Manly Aquarium, aimed at conserving this endangered species, which is already extinct in Victoria. The Aquarium currently has one grey nurse shark and the program is looking at intra vitro fertilisation (IVF) as a method of breeding. *Bamboo sharks. Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium is home to the first-ever in-vitro fertilised (IVF) shark in existence. The brown-banded bamboo shark pup was born on 3 March 2014, ending a process which began in September when aquarists collected a semen sample from a shark in Mooloolaba in northeastern Australia. *Sea turtles. The aquarium is also involved in the rehabilitation of turtles washed south into the colder Victorian waters where they cannot survive. The sea turtles are housed at the aquarium to gain strength, at which point they are taken north to Queensland to be released. *Seadragons. Melbourne Aquarium is one of few worldwide to have successfully bred the locally-endemic weedy seadragon in captivity.Melbourne Aquarium, Conservation Accessed 6 April 2012. Past attractions Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium formerly had a giant squid exhibit (frozen, not alive), which was moved to UnderWater World in Queensland. The Aquarium was also home to angler fish, the Japanese spider crab, jellyfish, blood sucking leeches, horseshoe crabs, venomous scorpions and tarantulas. Ownership In 2012, Merlin Entertainments, the global owner and operator of the Sea Life Centres brand as well as iconic brands such as Legoland and Madame Tussauds, purchased the Living and Leisure Group, then the owner-operators of the Melbourne Aquarium. In late 2013, after an extensive $8 million investment and redevelopment by Merlin Entertainments, the aquarium relaunched under the Sea Life brand, joining up to 100 Merlin-owned attractions worldwide.

The play is considered to be the most significant in Australian theatre history, and a \\"turning point\\",Peter Fitzpatrick, 'After The Doll: Australian Drama Since 1955', Edward Arnold Australia (1979), preface, vii openly and authentically portraying distinctly Australian life and characters. It was one of the first truly naturalistic \\"Australian\\" theatre productions. It was originally published by Angus & Robertson, before moving to Fontana Press and then Currency Press Plot The play is set in Australia, in the Melbourne suburb of Carlton and it details the events of the summer of 1953, in the lives of six central characters. The structure of the play is such that the nature of these characters and their situation and history is not revealed immediately, but rather gradually established as the story unfolds. By the end, the story and all its facets have been indirectly explained. The summer that the story spans marks the 17th year of an annual tradition in the lives of the characters, wherein two masculine sugarcane cutters, Arthur \\"Barney\\" Ibbot and Reuben \\"Roo\\" Webber, travel south to Melbourne for five months of frivolity and celebration with two city women, Olive Leech and Nancy (Roo bringing with him as a gift for Olive a kewpie doll, hence the name of the play). One of the women, Nancy, has apparently married some months before, and she is not present in the play, so in her place Olive has invited Pearl Cunningham to partake in the tradition. The other women present in the play are Kathie \\"Bubba\\" Ryan, a 22-year-old girl who has been coveting Olive and Nancy's lifestyle from her neighbouring house almost all her life, and Emma Leech, Olive's cynical, irritable, but wise mother. As the play progresses, it becomes obvious that, for many collective reasons, this summer is different from others; it is full of tensions, strains to recreate lost youth, and from what is said of previous years, not a fraction of the fun that others have been. Steadily things become worse; Roo is revealed to be broke and is forced to take a job in a paint factory. He is disillusioned with his age and weaknesses, while relations between Barney and him are in doubt, due to a recent question of loyalty. The situation is agitated in part by Pearl's uptight indignation and refusal to accept the lifestyle she is being presented with as \\"proper\\" or \\"decent\\". The play ends with a bitter fight between Olive and Roo after he proposes marriage to her and she is affronted, threatened by the prospect of any lifestyle other than the one to which she is accustomed. In the final scene, the two men leave together, the summer prematurely ended and the characters' futures uncertain. Summer of the Seventeenth Doll is part of a trilogy generally referred to as the Doll Trilogy; the story of The Doll is preceded by the prequels Kid Stakes (1975), set in 1937, which tells the story of the first year of the tradition and the origin of the gift of the Kewpie doll, and Other Times (1976), which is set in 1945 and includes most of the same characters. Productions=Melbourne= The Summer of the Seventeenth Doll had its world premiere on 28 November 1955, where it opened at the Union Theatre in Melbourne, Australia. This production of the play was directed by John Sumner and featured the following cast: * Roma Johnston as Pearl Cunningham * Fenella Maguire as Kathy \\"Bubba\\" Ryan * June Jago as Olive Leech * Ray Lawler as Barney Ibbot * Carmel Dunn as Emma Leech * Noel Ferrier as Roo Webber * Malcolm Billings as Johnnie Dowd =Sydney= The play opened in Sydney, Australia, approximately two months later, on 10 January 1956, this time with significant changes to its cast:Production listing at AusStage * Madge Ryan as Pearl Cunningham * Fenella Maguire as Kathie \\"Bubba\\" Ryan * June Jago as Olive Leech * Ray Lawler as Barney Ibbot * Ethel Gabriel as Emma Leech * Lloyd Berrell as Roo Webber * John Llewellyn as Johnnie Dowd =Country tour= On 28 January 1956 a thirteen-week country tour of the play was announced, commencing on 14 February. The play toured New South Wales and Queensland, returning to Sydney for an encore season, and featured the following cast: * Yvonne Lewis as Bubba Ryan * Jacqueline Kott as Pearl Cunningham * June Jago as Olive Leech * Robert Levis as Barney Ibbot * Dorothy Whiteley as Emma Leech * Kenneth Warren as Roo Webber * Keith Buckley as Johnnie Dowd =United Kingdom= After the final Sydney show of the play's country tour, The Doll moved to the United Kingdom, where it spent two weeks showing in Nottingham, Liverpool and Edinburgh before opening in London on 30 April 1957, with the following cast:Production listing at AusStage * Fenella Maguire as Bubba Ryan * Madge Ryan as Pearl Cunningham * June Jago as Olive Leech * Ray Lawler as Barney Ibbot * Ethel Gabriel as Emma Leech * Kenneth Warren as Roo Webber * Richard Pratt as Johnnie Dowd =New York= Encouraged by its wholehearted reception in Australia and Britain, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll took a trip to America, where audiences and critics were, most likely due to drastic cultural differences, rather underwhelmed with the production. The play opened in New York City on 23 January 1958, with no changes made to the cast. The Doll only ran a five-week season in America.Listing of New York production at Internet Broadway Database However, in 1967, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll featuring an all-black cast, was produced to great acclaim as one of four plays in the inaugural season of The Negro Ensemble Company with an international bill that included, Kongi's Harvest by Wole Soyinka, Song of the Lusitanian Bogey by Peter Weiss, and Daddy Goodness by American playwright Richard Wright. =Film adaptation= After continuing to tour Australia through 1958, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll was adapted by Leslie Norman for Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions - whose first film had been Marty with Ernest Borgnine - for United Artists in 1959. The film was retitled Season of Passion for the American market. This decision was severely lamented by some fans of the play, whose complaints were rooted in three essential criticisms: *The \\"Americanization\\" of the text, namely the casting of American actor Ernest Borgnine, who played his character (Roo) with an American accent. Others have thought the film was a recruiting film for migrants with the Englishman John Mills as Barney and Alan Garc√≠a as Dino, an Italian friend and fellow cane cutter who does not feature in the play. The female leads were played by Anne Baxter and Angela Lansbury, though the film featured many Australian actors. *It was set in Sydney rather than Melbourne. *The drastic changes to key plot points, namely the alternative, \\"happy\\" ending that the 1959 film adaptation entailed. This alternate ending was considered by some to be representative of a dire misunderstanding of the play and its message, and by others an attempt to make the film an international success at the box office and critical acclaim similar to the kitchen sink realism of Marty. The producers also added a comedy sequence where a young girl attempted to trick Roo in a tent at Luna Park. =1964 British TV adaptation= The play was adapted for British TV in 1964 as part of Thursday Theatre.1964 TV adaptation at IMDb The cast was: *Lyn Ashley as Bubba Ryan *Madge Ryan as Pearl Cunningham *Sheila Hancock as Olive Leech *Ewen Solon as Barney Ibbot *Grant Taylor as Ron Webber *Hazel Coppen as Emma Leech *George Roubicek as Johnny Dowd =1979 Australian TV adaptation= A version of the play was filmed in 1979 directed by Rod Kinnear.{http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/C415023 Summer of the Seventeenth Doll 1979 Australian TV] at Austlit =Most recent productions= Notable productions include: *1965: Sydney's Q Theatre stages a production of The Doll, one in which Ethel Gabriel, a member of the cast for nearly a decade, gave her last performance as Emma *1973: Sydney's Nimrod Theatre Company stages a production with Bill HunterProduction details at AusStage *1974: Queensland Theatre Company stages a production *1977: Melbourne Theatre Company revives the play as part of The Doll Trilogy (featuring prequels Kid Stakes and Other Times)Production information at AusStage *1988: Brisbane's La Boite Theatre Company stages play in August directed by Don Batchelor. *1983: Melbourne's Australian Nouveau Theatre (Antill) directed by Jean-Pierre Mignon *1985: Sydney Theatre Company revives the play as part of The Doll Trilogy directed by Rodney Fisher (which also plays in Melbourne) *1988: Sydney Theatre Company production travels overseas to New York\\"Australians Adrift in a World of Kewpie Dolls\\" by Stephen Holden, The New York Times, 30 July 1988] *1990: Birmingham Repertory Theatre in the UK directed by John Adams *1995: Melbourne Theatre Company directed by Robyn Nevin, which also played a national tour through 1995 and 1996 *2008: Brisbane's La Boite Theatre Company directed by Sean Mee. *2011: Belvoir production directed by Neil Armfield which toured Sydney, Melbourne (for Melbourne Theatre Company), Brisbane (for Queensland Theatre Company), Wollongong and Canberra through 2011 and 2012Summer of the Seventeenth Doll at Belvoir St Theatre *2015: State Theatre Company of South Australia at the Dunstan Playhouse, Adelaide Festival Centre directed by Georgie Brookmanhttp://www.statetheatrecompany.com.au/ *2020: Upcoming production by State Opera of South Australia in Her Majesty's Theatre, directed by Joseph Mitchell The iPad app In 2013 Currency Press released an iPad app which charts the 57-year history of Summer of the Seventeenth Doll.

During the later 1980s it was Norway's fifth-largest airline by revenue, operating a fleet of three Convair CV-580 and six Beechcraft Super King Air. The airline was based at Oslo Airport, Fornebu, as well as operating a base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. The airline was established as Paralift in 1968 to allow a group of friends to operate a Cessna 182 for parachuting. The company went commercial in 1971 and acquired four Cessna twin-props by 1975. The airline focused on business charters. During the late 1970s the fleet was replaced with Piper PA-31 Navajos. The Partnair name was adopted in the mid 1970s. The first of what would eventually be eight Beechcraft King Air and the later Super models was bought in 1978. Partnair briefly operated two Cessna 550 Citation II corporate jets in 1983. The airline merged with Nor-Fly Charter in 1984, acquiring two CV-580s. A third was added in 1986. It built a new hangar and office complex in 1985. The only spell of scheduled traffic, out of Notodden Airport, Tuven, took place between 1985 and 1986. The company went into a period with severe financial difficulties and went bankrupt in 1987, but soon revived. The crash of Partnair Flight 394 on 8 September 1989 was the final blow for the company, which filed for bankruptcy on 11 October. Operations were restarted in what became Air Stord. History=Paralift= The airline has its background in a group of parachuters who in 1968 established Paralift Air Service. The intention was to establish a company to own and operate an aircraft so they did not have to rent an aircraft each time they were parachuting. It took delivery of a Cessna 180 in February 1969, which it kept until August that year.Hagby: 300 It then took over a Cessna 182.Hagby: 299 These aircraft were both tailored as parachute-only aircraft. The following year the fleet was doubled with the arrival of a Cessna 310.Hagby: 287 The company was incorporated on 30 June 1971 and received a commercial air operator's certificate in the fall. The airline took delivery of a de Havilland Dragon Rapide in August, configured for parachuting. The aircraft was kept until 1973.Hagby: 120 Until the 1975 retirement of the Cessna 182, Paralift continued to operate parachuting flights. However, it increasingly focused on ad hoc and corporate charter. It targeted a growing market for executive charters using smaller twin-prop aircraft. Although slightly slower, they were significantly more economical that corporate jets. Paralift was able to operate many routes cheaper than scheduled services given that the entire aircraft was filled up. In addition, nonstop flights were available on any conceivable route combination, unlike scheduled services. Paralift was therefore successful at targeting smaller groups of executives traveling as a group. Paralift operated out of Oslo Airport, Fornebu. It subcontracted maintenance to Fred. Olsen Airtransport and catering to Scandinavian Airlines System. For the business charter market the airline bought a Cessna 310 in 1970, a Cessna 320 and Cessna 401 in 1972.Hagby: 152Hagby: 305 The Cessna 310 was replaced with a Cessna 402 in 1975. The Cessna 320 was sold in 1976 and replaced with the airline's first Piper PA-31 Navajo. Within three years Paralift was operating five such aircraft,Hagby: 270Hagby: 272 and had also bought a Piper PA-31T Cheyenne and a Cessna 404 Titan. =Partnair operations= Partnair Beechcraft Super King Air at EuroAirport Basel‚ÄìMulhouse‚ÄìFreiburg in 1986 Sometime between 1975 and 1977 the airline changed its name to Partnair. It saw increased business particularly from the booming oil industry. By 1977 the airline was the second-largest light twin-prop operator in the country. The airline flew 5,200 hours with its five aircraft in 1978. The Cheyenne was retired in 1980, replaced by a new Cheyenne a year later which remained in use until 1985.Hagby: 275 The first Beechcraft King Air 100 was delivered in 1978, followed by a second in 1980.Hagby: 273 That year Partnair also took delivery of its first Beechcraft Super King Air 200. The airline would gradually order more of these until operating six Super King Airs. A British Aerospace Jetstream 31 was ordered in July 1981, along with a further option, for delivery in October 1982. However, the order was canceled before delivery.Hagby: 376 Instead, Partnair took delivery of two used Cessna 550 Citation II corporate jets, but these were retired within a year.Hagby: 196Hagby: 311 Partnair started using simulators to train their pilots from 1982. The shipping company Tenvig bought the airline in 1983. In the following three years, they invested 43 million kroner in the company. From 15 May 1984 the former military terminal at Fornebu was converted into an executive terminal, named Terminal 2. In addition to Partnair moving its flights there, it signed a two-year contract to operate the terminal on behalf of the Civil Aviation Administration. Partnair Convair CV-580 at EuroAirport Basel‚ÄìMulhouse‚ÄìFreiburg in 1987 Partnair bought Nor-Fly Charter in September 1984. Nor-Fly operated two Convair CV-580s. Partnair used the aircraft to fly domestic charter for oil companies, mostly to And√∏ya Airport, Andenes, as well as larger corporate groups internationally. Nor-Fly had bought the two aircraft in 1980 and 1981, respectively; one was based at Fornebu and the other at Stavanger Airport, Sola. With the merger, Partnair relocated both aircraft to Stavanger. Maintenance on the Convairs was subcontracted to Fred. Olsen Airtransport. A new hangar and office building was completed at Oslo Airport, Fornebu in May 1985, having cost 15 million Norwegian kroner. The hangar measured while there was of office space. At the time the airline had 75 employees. The company stated that the merger had allowed it to operate better in two separate market sizes and was able to better sustain the volatility in the air taxi market. About half the company's revenue came from each size of aircraft. In September 1985 Partnair started talks with Norving with the aim of a merger, but the talks never led to anything. A third Convair 580 was bought in May 1986.Aircraft Accident Investigation Board Norway: 11 In the second half of 1984 the airline developed plans to start scheduled traffic, and applied for concession to operate out of Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Gothenburg and Copenhagen. They also applied to operate a route from Oslo via Notodden Airport, Tuven to Stavanger. The Notodden concession was granted in March 1985, and the route was started on 15 August using Super King Air and flew twice a day, five days a week. This route was made possible after an instrument landing system was installed at the airport. The upgrades also included a new terminal. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyr√•, a subsidiary of the Norwegian State Railways. Partnair Convair CV-580 at EuroAirport Basel‚ÄìMulhouse‚ÄìFreiburg in 1987 After five months, Partnair had lost 1.2 million kroner on the route. In average, they were selling three to four tickets per flight to Stavanger, and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to Stavanger reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month. The company had a deficit of 6.5 million kroner in 1986. After having lost 10 million kroner of its investment, Tenvig decided to withdraw from the airline and closed it down in April 1987. However, seventy percent of the company was bought by Helikopter Service. The airline started operations again in August, legally as a new company, Nye Partnair A/S. It soon reverted to the former name. After about a year the company was again running without a deficit and Helikopter Service sold its shares to the brothers Terje and Rolf Thoresen. From then the company started losing money and had a poor financial result in 1988. That year the airline operated three Convairs and six Super King Airs. In terms of revenue, it was the fifth-largest airline in Norway, with 80 employees. Parnair was one of several companies discussing a take-over of Norsk Air in 1988.Tjomsland: 149‚Äì150 The following year Partnair bought two smaller airlines, Fjellfly/Viking Air based in Kristiansand and 52 percent of Fonnafly based in Stord. =Accident and bankruptcy= The Convair CV-580 LN-PAA was the accident aircraft in Partnair Flight 394, here at Aberdeen Airport in 1987 Partnair Flight 394 crashed in Skagerrak near Hirtshals on 8 September 1989, killing all 55 people on board.Aircraft Accident Investigation Board Norway: 2 A central cause of the accident turned out to be the use of unapproved aircraft parts, specifically unapproved bolts fastening the vertical stabilizer to the fuselage. The findings would spur international attention to the issue of unapproved parts. Immediately after the accident Partnair grounded the other two Convairs and laid off 17 of its 45 employees. The King Air fleet remained in operation. The company had a poor financial situation before the accident, which was severely aggravated with the accident. By October the airline was attempting to sell the Convairs. The company filed for bankruptcy on 11 October 1989. At the time the airline had few assets and about 15 to 20 million kroner in debt. All the aircraft were at the time leased. The assets from Partnair were taken over by a new company, Nye Partnair A/S (\\"New Partnair\\"), which was owned by the Thorsen brothers along with Jostein Nerhus and Eirik M. Eide. Nye Partnair was incorporated in January 1990 and bought large portions of the estate in bankruptcy. This gave it an initial fleet of four Beechcraft Super King Air and one Beechcraft King Air.Resser: 45 Nye Partnair was initially based at Haugesund Airport, Karm√∏y,Reitan: 94 but relocated to Stord Airport, S√∏rstokken in May 1991Resser: 47 and took the name Air Stord.Resser: 48 The airline remained in business until 19 February 1999.Resser: 74 Fleet The following is a list of aircraft operated by Paralift and Partnair.

It carries the Lostwithiel and Fowey branch line across a stream on Shirehall Moor at Lostwithiel Promoters of an independent company conducted negotiations with the Cornwall Railway in 1861, regarding the construction of a branch line from that railway at Lostwithiel to a location at Caffamill Pill, Fowey, where deep water berthing was available for shipping. The route would run alongside the River Fowey and so would have gentle gradients and few engineering problems, apart from some bridges across small tributary rivers; new jetties were to be built at Carne Point, a short distance north of Fowey.Alan Bennett, The Great Western Railway in Mid Cornwall, Kingfisher Railway Publications, Southampton, 1988, An Act of Parliament was obtained on 30 June 1862, and the Lostwithiel and Fowey Railway was incorporated, with capital of ¬£30,000. The railway was to be 5 miles and 15 chains (8.4 km) in length. Money proved difficult to come by, and there was some delay in construction, and the line eventually opened on 1 June 1869, on the broad gauge. It did not carry passengers, and it was worked by the Cornwall Railway Joint Committee.R J Woodfin, The Cornwall Railway to its Centenary in 1859, Bradford Barton, Truro, 1972 There were close links with the Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway; some directors and officers served both companies, and offices were in a shared building at Par.Bradshaw's Railway Manual, Shareholders' Guide and Directory. (1871). The principal traffic was expected to be china clay and other minerals from the area around St Austell, but the financial performance of the company was dependent on the buoyancy of the mining activity. Difficult trading conditions were followed by the opening of a more direct route to Fowey by the Cornwall Minerals Railway on 1 June 1874, and the two companies engaged in a bitter price war. The company's finances became increasingly strained and the necessity to reconstruct a number of timber bridges proved impossible to fund, leading to suspension of the line's activity from 1 January 1880. The line was leased to the Cornwall Railway for use as storage sidings but traffic never resumed, despite several attempts to attract new business. The Cornwall Minerals Railway (CMR) itself had experienced financial difficulties and from 1 October 1877 had leased its lines to the Great Western Railway (also lessee of and operator of the Cornwall Railway), but as trade improved its income from the lease and a financial arrangement with creditors resulted in the CMR having cash available, and it made arrangements to purchase the Lostwithiel and Fowey line. The purchase was confirmed by Act of Parliament of 27 June 1892. The L&FR; Company was dissolved and the line and jetty accommodation were transferred to the Cornwall Minerals Railway. The CMR reconstructed the line and converted it to the standard gauge, rebuilding and extending the jetties at Carne Point also. The CMR had a Fowey station a short distance south of the L&FR; terminal, and the CMR constructed a connection to link the two railways. The line reopened on 16 September 1895, for both goods and passenger traffic, and passenger trains ran to the CMR passenger station at Fowey.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, vol II, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931, page 410 An intermediate station was opened at Golant. The Cornwall Minerals Railway sold its line to the Great Western Railway, and this took effect on 1 July 1896, from which date the Lostwithiel and Fowey line was simply the Fowey branch of the GWR. Loaded mineral trains from Fowey were usually routed on the line in preference to the Pinnock Tunnel route due to the challenging gradients on the latter.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Wenford Bridge to Fowey, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1998, The passenger service on the line was interrupted in both World Wars: it closed from 2 April 1917 \\"for security purposes\\", reopening on 1 November 1917. During the Second World War passenger services were withdrawn once again for \\"security reasons\\". The railway closed on 1 January 1940 and reopened on 9 February 1942; it closed again on 24 August 1942 and reopened on 3 October 1942; it closed again on 2 May 1944 and reopened on 2 October 1944 after the D-Day landings had happened. Fowey was the main port for loading ammunition for the US 29th Division which landed on Omaha Beach on D Day. In early September 1943 the US were unloading an average of 49 wagons of ammunition a day with a peak of 103 wagons in a day. From 6 June 1944 to the end of the month they handled DWT of 13828 tons. (Source: US Naval documents) The World War II period also enabled reuse of sidings at Woodgate Pill near Fowey. These were used for a munitions store.Maurice Dart, East Cornwall Mineral Railways, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2004, http://www.cornwallrailwaysociety.org.uk/lostwihiel-to-fowey-branch.html Visit to the War Department sidings at Woodgate Pill March 2014 Never heavily used, the passenger service from Lostwithiel to Fowey was withdrawn on 4 January 1965, and the line now carries only mineral traffic to Carne Point. The CMR line from Par to Fowey closed on 1 July 1968, and the Lostwithiel and Fowey route is now the only rail route to Fowey. Locomotives An agreement was signed with the Cornwall Railway for that company to work the line once it was complete. As the line when opened in 1869 only went as far as Carne Point, and that only for goods traffic, the Cornwall Railway would not fulfil the agreement and so hired a locomotive to the railway instead. The Lostwithiel and Fowey considered this arrangement as too expensive. In February 1870 the directors reported that \\"the temporary arrangement made with the Cornwall for carrying on the traffic did not leave the company sufficient profit to pay the cost of maintaining the permanent way. The directors had hired an engine - the only one they could obtain at so short a notice - it is not, however, of sufficient power, and it has become necessary to obtain a more efficient one. With this view, the directors were negotiating for the purchase or hire of an engine of greater power.\\" Present day trains are usually powered by DB Schenker's locomotives. Plans to re-open passenger service In 2014 a plan was proposed to reinstate passenger trains on the line, funding to upgrade the track and reinstate a station at Fowey would be required. The project had the support of Fowey mayor John Berryman and some councillors in Lostwithiel, Fowey, and Cornwall Council.

(2017). Cyber and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, explosives challenges : threats and counter efforts. Springer. Due to the logical limitations of security testing, passing security testing is not an indication that no flaws exist or that the system adequately satisfies the security requirements. Typical security requirements may include specific elements of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, availability, authorization and non- repudiation.\\"Introduction to Information Security\\" US-CERT https://www.us- cert.gov/security-publications/introduction-information-security Actual security requirements tested depend on the security requirements implemented by the system. Security testing as a term has a number of different meanings and can be completed in a number of different ways. As such a Security Taxonomy helps us to understand these different approaches and meanings by providing a base level to work from.  Confidentiality  * A security measure which protects against the disclosure of information to parties other than the intended recipient is by no means the only way of ensuring the security.  Integrity  Integrity of information refers to protecting information from being modified by unauthorized parties * A measure intended to allow the receiver to determine that the information provided by a system is correct. * Integrity schemes often use some of the same underlying technologies as confidentiality schemes, but they usually involve adding information to a communication, to form the basis of an algorithmic check, rather than the encoding all of the communication. * To check if the correct information is transferred from one application to other.  Authentication  This might involve confirming the identity of a person, tracing the origins of an artifact, ensuring that a product is what its packaging and labeling claims to be, or assuring that a computer program is a trusted one.  Authorization  * The process of determining that a requester is allowed to receive a service or perform an operation. * Access control is an example of authorization.  Availability  * Assuring information and communications services will be ready for use when expected. * Information must be kept available to authorized persons when they need it.  Non-repudiation  * In reference to digital security, non-repudiation means to ensure that a transferred message has been sent and received by the parties claiming to have sent and received the message. Non-repudiation is a way to guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message.  Taxonomy  Common terms used for the delivery of security testing: * Discovery - The purpose of this stage is to identify systems within scope and the services in use. It is not intended to discover vulnerabilities, but version detection may highlight deprecated versions of software / firmware and thus indicate potential vulnerabilities. * Vulnerability Scan - Following the discovery stage this looks for known security issues by using automated tools to match conditions with known vulnerabilities. The reported risk level is set automatically by the tool with no manual verification or interpretation by the test vendor. This can be supplemented with credential based scanning that looks to remove some common false positives by using supplied credentials to authenticate with a service (such as local windows accounts). * Vulnerability Assessment - This uses discovery and vulnerability scanning to identify security vulnerabilities and places the findings into the context of the environment under test. An example would be removing common false positives from the report and deciding risk levels that should be applied to each report finding to improve business understanding and context. * Security Assessment - Builds upon Vulnerability Assessment by adding manual verification to confirm exposure, but does not include the exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain further access. Verification could be in the form of authorized access to a system to confirm system settings and involve examining logs, system responses, error messages, codes, etc. A Security Assessment is looking to gain a broad coverage of the systems under test but not the depth of exposure that a specific vulnerability could lead to. * Penetration Test - Penetration test simulates an attack by a malicious party. Building on the previous stages and involves exploitation of found vulnerabilities to gain further access. Using this approach will result in an understanding of the ability of an attacker to gain access to confidential information, affect data integrity or availability of a service and the respective impact. Each test is approached using a consistent and complete methodology in a way that allows the tester to use their problem solving abilities, the output from a range of tools and their own knowledge of networking and systems to find vulnerabilities that would/ could not be identified by automated tools. This approach looks at the depth of attack as compared to the Security Assessment approach that looks at the broader coverage. * Security Audit - Driven by an Audit / Risk function to look at a specific control or compliance issue. Characterized by a narrow scope, this type of engagement could make use of any of the earlier approaches discussed (vulnerability assessment, security assessment, penetration test). * Security Review - Verification that industry or internal security standards have been applied to system components or product. This is typically completed through gap analysis and utilizes build / code reviews or by reviewing design documents and architecture diagrams. This activity does not utilize any of the earlier approaches (Vulnerability Assessment, Security Assessment, Penetration Test, Security Audit)  Tools  * CSA - Container and Infrastructure Security Analysis * DAST - Dynamic Application Security Testing * DLP - Data Loss Prevention * IAST - Interactive Application Security Testing * IDS/IPS - Intrusion Detection and/or Intrusion Prevention * OSS - Open Source Software Scanning * RASP - Runtime Application Self Protection * SAST - Static Application Security Testing * SCA - Software Composition Analysis * WAF - Web Application Firewall  See also  * National Information Assurance Glossary  References  Category:Computer security Category:Software testing ","title":"Security testing"},{"id":"3943133","text":"Pagurus bernhardus is the common marine hermit crab of Europe's Atlantic coasts. It is sometimes referred to as the common hermit crab or soldier crab. Its carapace reaches long, and is found in both rocky and sandy areas, from the Arctic waters of Iceland, Svalbard and Russia as far south as southern Portugal, but its range does not extend as far as the Mediterranean Sea. It can be found in pools on the upper shore and at the mean tide level down to a depth of approximately , with smaller specimens generally found in rock pools around the middle shore and lower shore regions, with larger individuals at depth. P. bernhardus is an omnivorous detritivore that opportunistically scavenges for carrion, and which can also filter feed when necessary. Illustration by Augusta Foote Arnold. Pagurus bernhardus uses shells of a number of gastropod species for protection, including Littorina littorea, Littorina obtusata, Nassarius reticulatus, Gibbula umbilicalis, Nucella lapillus and Buccinum. In the warmer parts of its range, the sea anemone Calliactis parasitica is often found growing on the shell occupied by Pagurus bernhardus. In colder waters, this r√¥le is filled by Hormathia digitata. Hermit crabs fight one another for gastropod shells and have a preference for shells of certain species.

It is down-line from via . It is managed by Great Western Railway, which also operates the train service. It was known as Barnstaple Junction from 1874 to 1970 as it was the junction between lines to , , and Exeter. History Barnstaple and its railways. \\\\- Black lines: in use \\\\- Grey lines: closed and lifted A railway for goods traffic was operated from Fremington Quay, opening in August 1848. On 1 August 1854 the North Devon Railway opened from Barnstaple to Crediton. Trains were extended via Fremington to Bideford on 2 November 1855. This route was eventually extended to loop back to Okehampton via Torrington and Halwill Junction.Nicholas, John, The North Devon Line, Oxford Publishing Company 1992, The North Devon Railway was amalgamated into the London and South Western Railway on 1 January 1865. The station was enlarged and became known as Barnstaple Junction on 20 July 1874 when the railway opened the Ilfracombe branch line. The line crossed the river on a large bridge to a station at Barnstaple Quay which in turn was replaced by Barnstaple Town on an adjacent site in 1898 when the narrow gauge Lynton and Barnstaple Railway was opened. This station is now a smart school. On 1 June 1887 a loop line was laid to connect the station with the Devon and Somerset Railway, later taken over by the Great Western Railway, which had opened its own Barnstaple station at Victoria Road as the terminus of the line from Taunton on 1 November 1873. The station was further enlarged in 1924. The station in 1964. In the foreground, the Ilfracombe branch line tracks diverge to the left; the tracks to the right lead to Bideford. The station saw a reduction in services from the mid-1960s. The first services to be withdrawn were the passenger trains to Torrington on 2 October 1965. Passenger services had been transferred from Victoria Road in January 1960 and the line to Taunton closed on 3 October 1966. Victoria Road remained open for goods traffic, accessed via the loop line from Barnstaple Junction, until 5 March 1970, when it closed entirely. The line to Ilfracombe was closed later that year, on 5 October, and so the station became plain Barnstaple once more. On 21 May 1971 the track was simplified and the line to Umberleigh was reduced to just one track. A new booking office was opened on 10 November 1981 but goods trains beyond on the Fremington line were withdrawn on 31 August 1982 leaving the station as a terminus. In 2006 the bridge that carried Sticklepath Hill (the A3125) across the former Torrington and Ilfracombe lines was demolished to make way for a road junction for the Barnstaple Western Bypass, which opened in May 2007. The roundabout here has been built on a raised platform in order to allow for the reopening of the line to Bideford should this be proved viable in the future. Work from the bypass has also included a larger station car park and better bus access ‚Äì a large number of Barnstaple town services, as well as services to Bideford, Ilfracombe and South Molton now call at the station. During the year ended March 2009, passengers using Barnstaple station exceeded ¬º million. In 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies included the Barnstaple to Bideford route in its Connecting Communities: Expanding Access to the Rail Network. This recommended some closed lines ought to be rebuilt to restore a railway service to large communities. =Motive power depot= The North Devon Railway opened a motive power depot at the station in 1854. A larger building was erected alongside in 1864 by the London and South Western Railway. This building was re-roofed by the Southern Railway in the 1940s, but closed by British Railways in 1964 and demolished.Roger Griffiths & Paul Smith, Directory of British engine sheds: 1, (OXford: OPC, 1999), p.30. =Station Cafe= The cafe at Barnstaple station was opened in 2008 by Mike Day in one of the 'closed' areas of the station building, and it appeared in a list of the ten best station cafes published in The Guardian just one year later. =James May's Toy Stories= This line to Bideford was recreated in miniature for one day in 2009 using OO gauge track for episode 6 of James May's Toy Stories, an attempt to build the longest ever model railway orchestrated by James May. Although the track was restored between the two towns the model railway trains were only able to reach the site of Instow signalbox before failing.James May's Toy Stories, Hornby May stated that he chose the location for the attempt due to his desire to see the line restored. He repeated the experiment in 2011, using Hornby R603 rails laid as double track by a mechanical track layer. A competition saw a British team, led by May, racing three trains from Barnstaple to Bideford against a German team running the route in the opposite direction.James May's Great Train Race: Tarka Trail 2 All six trains completed the 10-mile run, with the British team claiming a 2:1 victory. Description Looking towards Exeter The single platform is on the east (right) of trains arriving from Exeter. There is level access to the station car park. The centre of Barnstaple is reached by crossing the Long Bridge over the River Taw from the station. A footpath from the station leads onto the cycleway along the abandoned railway line to Bideford which forms part of the South West Coast Path. Engineers sidings remain just before the terminus, with a run around loop accessed from a ground frame. The connection to the second platform also remains however the platform itself is no longer in use. Services A pair of s at Barnstaple going to Barnstaple is served by seventeen trains each weekday (approximately once each hour), eighteen on Saturdays (due to a 00:06 service) and thirteen on Sundays (approximately once each hour) since the December 2019 timetable change. Most services run to St James' Park with some terminating at Exeter St Davids and Exeter Central.

The Association of Reform Zionists of America is the American Reform movement's Zionist organization. Their mission ‚Äúendeavors to make Israel fundamental to the sacred lives and Jewish identity of Reform Jews. As a Zionist organization, the association champions activities that further enhance Israel as a pluralistic, just and democratic Jewish state.‚Äù In Israel, Reform Zionism is associated with the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism. History Historically, Zionism was a secular ideology that was opposed by Orthodox and Conservative and Reform. While Orthodox and Conservative groups opposed Zionism for being more nationalist than religious, Reform Judaism opposed a return to Zion for theological reasons. Reform theology conceived of Judaism as the universal religion of the prophets. In 1845, Samuel Hirsch, David Einhorn and Samuel Holdheim passed a resolution at the Frankfurt Conference that removed references to Palestine and a \\"Jewish State\\" from prayers on the grounds that nationalism and statehood were not compatible with Reform theology. Similar resolutions in 1869, 1885 and 1897 rejected the idea of \\"restoration of the Jewish State\\". As early as 1890 the Central Conference of American Rabbis had publicly opposed Zionist ideology. In the early 20th century many Jewish leaders accepted the ideal of Americanization, which was an undivided political, economic and cultural affiliation with America. Underlying the anti-Zionist views of many American Reform rabbis was their acceptance of Americanization. Zionism was, to them, an ideology of foreign origins that was associated with newly arrived Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Wise said the Zionist movement in America was sponsored by refugees who had been persecuted in Europe. These views were echoed in Jewish newspapers like The American Israelite. The Pittsburgh Platform of 1885 rejected Jewish nationalism: \\"We consider ourselves no longer a nation but a religious community, and therefore expect neither a return to Palestine,...nor the restoration of any laws concerning a Jewish state\\". This position did not change until the Columbus Platform of 1937 which affirmed the \\"obligation of all Jewry\\" to build a \\"Jewish homeland\\" in Palestine and to make it \\"not only a haven of refuge for the oppressed but also a center of Jewish culture and spiritual life\\". In the San Francisco Centenary Perspective of 1976 the State of Israel is described as the land to which Reform Jews have \\"innumerable religious and ethnic ties\\". However, with the establishment of the State of Israel, many Progressive/Reform Jews saw a need for a Jewish national home in the Biblical Land of Israel. In 1978, the Association of Reform Zionists of America began working to conceptualize a Zionism that took the universalistic ideals of Reform Judaism, as well as the particular needs of all Jewish people, into account. In 1997, the association solidified thinking regarding the acceptability of Zionism within the Reform Movement through the acceptance of the Miami Platform of the Central Conference of American Rabbis.Reform Judaism and Zionism: A Centenary Platform The Miami Platform makes the distinction between Medinat Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael. The platform says, in part, > During two millennia of dispersion and persecution, Am Yisrael [people of > Israel] never abandoned hope for the rebirth of a national home in Eretz > Yisrael. The Shoah [Holocaust] intensified our resolve to affirm life and > pursue the Zionist dream of a return to Eretz Yisrael. Even as we mourned > for the loss of one-third of our people, we witnessed the miraculous rebirth > of Medinat Yisrael, the Jewish people's supreme creation in our age. > Centuries of Jewish persecution, culminating in the Shoah, demonstrated the > risks of powerlessness. We, therefore, affirm Am Yisrael's reassertion of > national sovereignty, but we urge that it be used to create the kind of > society in which full civil, human, and religious rights exist for all its > citizens. Ultimately, Medinat Yisrael will be judged not on its military > might but on its character. While we view Eretz Yisrael as sacred, the > sanctity of Jewish life takes precedence over the sanctity of Jewish land. Through the ideal of Tikkun Olam (healing the world), Reform Zionism sees the role of the State of Israel as the means by which the messianic era can be achieved, by acting as a \\"light unto the nations\\", a national example of ideal prophetic principles of justice and peace. For the Reform Zionist, this means that by working to make Israel a better place, one can lead the world in working towards a state of perfection. Due to this, the Reform Zionist movement is heavily involved in social activism in Israel. As a religious, rather than political, ideology, Reform Zionism and its organizations do not see themselves as inherently political, and do not align with any Israeli political party or movement. =Hebrew Union College= In 1897 Hebrew Union College President and founder Isaac M. Wise described Judaism as \\"eternal\\" and \\"not tied down to a piece of land here or there\\". In 1903, Kaufmann Kohler replaced Wise as President of Hebrew Union College. Kohler believed that American Judaism \\"stands for American thought and American spirit, and not for Zionistic Neo-Hebraism or the language of the Jewish ghetto\\". The College adopted the position that \\"America is our Zion\\". Between 1905 and 1907 several faculty members resigned. Louis Lipsky said he was forced to resign over his support for Zionism. In 1907 three pro-Zionist instructors resigned their positions: Henry Malter, Max L. Margolis and Max Schloessinger. Both Malter and Schloessinger had published papers that were critical of Reform theology's rejection of Zionism. Schloessinger was particularly influenced by Ahad Ha'am. Zionists accused the College of forcing the men out because of their views. Margolis said that Kohler had told him that a Zionist could not be trusted to teach biblical exegesis. Public perception, including among the students of the College, was that Margolis was a victim of bigoted prejudice against Zionism. The Jewish Exponent wrote that a Zionist professor could not be allowed to turn the universal teachings of Judaism into \\"crude and nationalistic utterances\\". In 1920 after the San Remo Declaration on Palestine the College reaffirmed their anti-Zionist views in a statement: \\"We declare that no one land, Palestine or any other, can be called 'the national home of the Jews'\\". =The Union of American Hebrew Congregations= The Union of American Hebrew Congregations was founded in 1873 by Isaac M. Wise. In 1898 it adopted a resolution opposing Zionism which said: \\"The Jews are not a nation, but a religious community\\". They called Zion a \\"holy memory\\" but mainted that \\"America is our Zion\\". They said the mission of Judaism was spiritual, rather than political. This position was reaffirmed in 1919: \\"We, therefore, do not seek Israel for any national homeland, it being our conviction that Israel is at home in every free country and should be at home in all lands\\". Union member Isaac Wolfe Bernheim was opposed to political Zionism supported the establishment of the Reform Church of American Israelites made up of \\"100 percent Americans\\" so that the \\"voice of the real American Israel may be heard\\". Bernheim and publications like The American Hebrew suggested replacing the term \\"Jewish\\" to avoid association with Zionist ideology, which they feared could create doubts about their loyalty to America. These proposals were unpopular and unsuccessful.  Youth  The Reform Zionist movement has an international youth wing, represented by its youth movement, Netzer Olami, which includes branches in many countries across the world.  Affiliated communities in Israel  There are two Reform Zionist Kibbutzim in Israel, Kibbutz Yahel and Kibbutz Lotan in the Arava. There is a Reform Zionist agricultural community in the north called Har Halutz.

Early years Arison was born Theodore Arisohn on 24 February 1924 in Tel Aviv (in the then British Mandate of Palestine) to Meir, a wealthy businessman, and Vera Arisohn. He was a third-generation sabra of Romanian descent and studied commerce and economics at the American University of Beirut and fought as a member of the Jewish Brigade of the British Army during World War II. After the British departure, he served as an officer in the IDF during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, eventually achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. From 1946 to 1951, he managed M. Dizengoff & Co., a shipping company. Career Frustrated by the lack of business opportunities, Arison wrapped up his business and moved to the United States after 1952. He took his family to New York in 1954 and moved to Miami, Florida, in 1966, where he co-founded Norwegian Cruise Lines in 1966 with Knut Kloster.Beyond Ships In 1971 the partnership broke up on bad terms and Arison formed Carnival Cruise Lines in 1972 with the help of Meshulam Riklis, in which he would make his fortune. In 1981, he established the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts based in Miami. He brought professional basketball to South Florida with the formation of the Miami Heat in 1988, and established the Arison Foundation, a philanthropic institution, in Israel and the United States. In 1986, Arison's condominium neighbor, Count de S.G. Elkaim (Vice President at E.F. Hutton & Company, Inc.), advised him to go public before an impending big correction in the stock market. Following his advice and guidance, Carnival Cruise Lines was floated on the American Stock Exchange in July 1987, one month before the stock market top and the infamous crash of October 1987. (Hutton was one of the four underwriters.) No competition was able to raise money, which gave Carnival an advantage. In February 1989, Arison awarded in the strictest of confidence the exclusive sale of the company at $30 per share to Elkaim. The stock market recovery from the emotional shock on the 1987 crash was not able to absorb this transaction. Consequently, having Carnival in the stock market and the ensuing rally until 1999 catapulted Arison to one of the world's richest people. Return to Israel In an effort to avoid estate tax in the United States, in 1990 Arison renounced his U.S. citizenship and residence, and returned to Israel where he founded Arison Investments. In 1997, Arison Investments headed a consortium that purchased the controlling share in Bank Hapoalim for more than $1 billion, the largest privatization in Israel's history. Family Arison married Mina Wasserman (1927-2012), who immigrated to Israel from Romania, in 1948 and they had two children: a son Micky (born 1949) and a daughter Shari (born 1957). The couple divorced after moving to Florida in 1966. In 1967 he married Marilyn \\"Lin\\" Hersh and later adopted her son Michael (born 1961). Death Arison died in Tel Aviv on 1 October 1999. Micky Arison was Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation & plc until August 2013 and is currently chairman of the company. Shari Arison is Israel's wealthiest woman, and is the owner of Arison Investments that comprises several business companies, the largest among them Bank Hapoalim, and of several philanthropic organizations that are subsidiaries of The Ted Arison Family Foundation. At the time of his death, Arison failed by approximately nine months to meet the requirement of being outside of United States territory for 10 years for the tax benefits of his renunciation of U.S. citizenship to be realized.

Their variation reflects the diversity of Indian culture and food habits. Ingredients Most flat breads from northern India are unleavened and made primarily from milled flour, usually atta or maida, and water. Some flatbreads, especially paratha, may be stuffed with vegetables and layered with either ghee or butter. In Maharashtra and Karnataka breads are also made from grains like jowar (Sorghum bicolor), ragi, a finger millet (Eleusine coracana) and bajra or pearl millet, and is called \\"rotla\\" in Gujarat and \\"bhakri\\" in Maharashtra. In southern India and the West Coast, most flat breads are made from peeled and split black lentils (urad dal) and rice. Popular varieties include dosa, appam, uttapam and rice rotis and ragi rotis. Most Indian breads make use of the yeast spores in the atmosphere for fermentation. Preparation In northern India, a dough of the main ingredient is prepared and flattened by rolling. Most Indian breads, such as roti, kulcha and chapati, are baked on tava, a griddle made from cast iron, steel or aluminum. Others such as puri and bhatura are deep-fried. The dough for these breads is usually made with less water in order to reduce oil soaked up when frying. In Southern India, a batter of rice and black lentils is prepared and ladled in small amounts onto a hot greased skillet, where it is spread out into a thin circle and fried with oil or ghee until golden brown. In Western India (including the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan) bread may be made from coarse grains such as bajra, sorghum or ragi, though wheat is the staple in these regions. The grains or cereals are usually milled into a fine powder, and mixed with a little water to make a smooth dough. This dough is patted into a circle by hand, either by holding it between the two hands or by placing it on an upturned plate or other flat surface. In Maharashtra a multi-grain flat-bread called \\"thalipeeth\\" is also prepared. It contains many grains and cereals like wheat, rice, bajra, jowar, ragi, horsegram, green gram, black gram, chickpeas and so on. Each grain or cereal is roasted separately and then milled together into a fine powder. Spices and chopped onions are added along with water to make the dough, and it is patted into circles, after which it is roasted on a griddle with some ghee or oil. It is often served with homemade butter. Indian breads of Central Asian origin, such as naan and tandoori roti, are baked in a tandoor. Naan is usually leavened with yeast. Varieties Different varieties of Indian bread include Chapati, Phulka, Puri, Roti, Bajra Rotla, Thepla, Paratha, Naan, Kulcha, Bhatoora, Appam, Dosa, Luchi, Puran Poli, Pathiri, Parotta and many more. Some of these, like Paratha and Roti have many varieties. Some varieties depend on the kind of grain used to prepare them, and others depend on the fillings they contain. * Adai ‚Äì a typical dish in South India and Sri Lanka.

Li√®ge was part of the Holy Roman Empire for 800 years. ' (, \\"small-state-ery\\") is a German word used, often pejoratively, to denote the territorial fragmentation in Germany and neighboring regions during the Holy Roman Empire (especially after the end of the Thirty Years' War), and during the German Confederation in the first half of the 19th century.Historian J. Whaley defines as \\"A (pejorative) term coined in the early 19th century to denote the extreme territorial fragmentation of the Reich\\". J. Whaley, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire (1493‚Äì1806), Oxford University Press, 2011, vol. 2, p. 653 (Glossary). It refers to the large number of nearly sovereign small and medium-sized secular and ecclesiastical principalities and free imperial cities, some of which were little larger than a single town or the surrounding grounds of the monastery of an Imperial abbey. Estimates of the total number of German states at any given time during the 18th century vary, ranging from 294 to 348The Times, Atlas of European History, Harper Collins, 1994, p. 127 or more. Territorial fragmentation was compounded by the fact that, due to the haphazard territorial formation of many states or the partition of dynastic states through inheritance, a very large number of Holy Roman Empire states were constituted of non-contiguous parts, which resulted in countless enclaves or exclaves. In the summer of 1789, young Wilhelm von Humboldt and some friends, leaving Brunswick, capital of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, for France to observe the revolutionary events unfolding in Paris, needed to enter and exit six duchies, four bishoprics and one free imperial city (Aachen) before reaching the French border.E. D. Brose, German History 1789‚Äì1871, From the Holy Roman Empire to the Bismarckian Reich, Berghahn Books, 1997, p. 4. History The powerful and autonomous German stem duchies, that already existed before the demise of the Carolingian Empire and the formation of East Francia during the 9th century have basically shaped the federal character of the kingdom. Unlike in other European kingdoms, a college of the Imperial princes elected the king from among the territorial dukes after the Carolingian line had died out around the year 898. This system prevented the development of a strong centralized monarchy as local rulers, who sought to promote their own interests and autonomy often rebelled against the sovereign ruler and conflicts had to be solved on the battlefield. The imperial interregna between 1245 and 1312 and between 1378 and 1433 increased political instability and strengthened the communal movements, such as the Swabian League of Cities, the Hanseatic League and the Swiss Confederacy. Feuding among the lesser Territorial nobility, who received their fief from the territorial princes lead to conflicts such as the Thuringian Counts' War and further territorial fragmentation. The Free imperial cities, many of them founded by the German kings and emperors during the 10th to 13th century, had initially been administered by the Imperial nobility ('), direct vassals of the emperor. These towns gradually gained independence as their patrician city magistrates assumed full control of administration and justice. > The political fragmentation of the Empire was the single most salient > characteristic of German history throughout the early modern period; it > underlay and conditioned development in all areas of public life.John > Gagliardo, Germany Under the Old Regime, 1600-1790, Longman, 1991, p. viii. While in other European kingdoms such as France, coherent nation states emerged as a result of early modern ideas of political concentration and centralisation, the Habsburg dynasty, who already controlled the Duchy of Austria, Bohemia and Hungary, ruled the Holy Roman Empire since 1438 and managed to permanently occupy the imperial throne until 1806 (with a brief exception between 1742 and 1745). The Habsburg family, however pursued its Grand Strategy policy, that focused on long-term dynastic reign at the center of a vast, multi-layered and multi-ethnic realm against Bourbon France and the Ottoman Empire. The imperial lands rather served to retain buffer zones, that were at odds with any concepts of patriotism and national identity. In 1495 emperor Maximilian I attempted to reform the empire. An Imperial supreme court (Reichskammergericht) was established, imperial taxes were levied, and the power of the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) was increased. The reforms, however, were frustrated by the continued territorial fragmentation of the Empire. The Protestant Reformation represented a major threat to imperial integrity. Emperor Charles V stated in 1546: ...if we failed to intervene now, all the Estates of Germany would be in danger of breaking with the faith.... With the 1548 Augsburg Interim he attempted to reconcile the religious schism in Germany, but instead only prompted new Protestant defiance. Since the 17th century the Kingdom of Prussia emerged as the second dominant power, that also incorporated substantial non-German territories and lands beyond the borders of the empire, while excluding major parts of Germany proper. Apart from these two states, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of hundreds of small, German- speaking principalities, most of which derived from successive dynastic splits (feudal fragmentation), sometimes reflected in compound names such as Saxe- Coburg; some of these were united through royal marriages, although the resulting entity was often not a contiguous territory. During the early modern period, these small states modernised their military, judicial, and economic administrations. These hardly existed at the imperial level, and the emperor was little more than a feudalistic confederal figurehead, without political or military clout. After the Reformation, the Empire's small states were divided along religious lines. Those headed by Roman Catholic dynasties faced those ruled by Protestant dynasties in the Thirty Years' War and other conflicts. After French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte forced the Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II, to dissolve the Empire in 1806, Kleinstaaterei was altered, but not eliminated. Through the elimination of territories ruled by prince-bishops (secularisation) and through the consolidation of neighbouring principalities, enclaves and exclaves, Napoleon reduced several hundred states into a relative concentration of a little over two dozen states in the Confederation of the Rhine. This confederation did not survive Napoleon's military defeat at the hands of the allies, but the previous principalities were not entirely restored. Prussia and the Austrian Empire‚Äîthe successor state to the Habsburg Monarchy‚Äîwere the only major German powers, and neither had been part of the Confederation of the Rhine. The victorious allies, including Prussia and Austria, decided at the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì15) on widespread dynastic restorations, although some of Napoleon's consolidations were maintained, and Austria and Prussia helped themselves to some formerly independent territories. The resulting territorial division resulted in a consolidated version‚Äîaround 40 states‚Äîof the pre-Napoleonic Kleinstaaterei. The rise of nationalism across Europe brought movements striving for \\"nation-states\\", each governing an entire (ethno-cultural) people. German nationalists began to insist on a unified Germany. The call for a unified nation-state was one of the central demands of the Revolutions of 1848, but the ruling dynasties of the smaller German states and of multinational Austria and Prussia managed to resist nationalist efforts at unification. Also German writer and statesman Goethe had always opposed this, writing: \\"Frankfurt, Bremen, Hamburg, Luebeck are large and brilliant, and their impact on the prosperity of Germany is incalculable. Yet, would they remain what they are if they were to lose their independence and be incorporated as provincial cities into one great German Empire? I have reason to doubt this.\\" Only after Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck gradually built a unified German state under the Prussian royal house of Hohenzollern did Kleinstaaterei largely end in 1871 with the founding of the German Empire. (The only surviving petty states‚ÄîLuxembourg and Liechtenstein‚Äîlie at the periphery of the German-speaking world.) The founding of the German Empire created a largely German nation-state. While the German Empire excluded the partly German but multinational Habsburg domains of Austria‚ÄìHungary, it included a substantial Polish minority in parts of eastern Prussia and other minorities along its northern and western borders. The unification of the German Empire put Germany on the map as a major European power, albeit too late to become a major colonial presence. Internally in the nation some of these fragmented boundaries and small political units continued to exist until the modern States of Germany were established in the Federal Republic after World War II. The decentralised nature of Kleinstaaterei made it difficult for the German economy to live up to its potential. Varying systems of weights and measures, different currencies and numerous tariffs impeded trade and investment, although the creation of the German Customs Union had begun to lift these barriers. The startling rapidity of Germany's economic growth after unification under Bismarck provided further evidence that the Kleinstaaterei had been economically repressive. The system did contribute to cultural diversity within Germany, and the numerous rival courts‚Äîthough usually politically insignificant‚Äîoften gained some renown through patronage. Modern German usage Today, the term Kleinstaaterei is sometimes used in the German media and elsewhere in a figurative sense to describe the German political system of federalism in a critical way, especially referring to its seeming inefficiency to decide on reforms in political fields that are the responsibility of the L√§nder (states of Germany) and thus are under the auspices of sixteen different administrations. As of 2010, Kleinstaaterei is most often invoked in matters of educational policy, such as the difficulties caused by the different school systems for children of families that move from one state to another.

Career  Lorenz was born in D√ºsseldorf, and studied with Ernst Grenzebach in Berlin in the 1920s. He made his debut at the Semperoper in Dresden in 1927, becoming a principal tenor. From 1929 to 1944 he was a member of the ensemble at the Berlin State Opera, appearing also at the New York Metropolitan Opera (1931‚Äì34), the Bayreuth Festspielhaus (1933‚Äì39, 1952, 1954) and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden (1934 and 1937). He sang, too, at the Vienna State Opera (1929‚Äì33, 1936‚Äì44, 1954). Audiences at the Salzburg Festival also heard him, and he created roles in such post-World War II works as Gottfried von Einem‚Äôs Der Prozess (Josef K, 1953), Rolf Liebermann‚Äôs Penelope (1954) and Rudolf Wagner-R√©geny‚Äôs Das Bergwerk zu Falun (1961). Lorenz's operatic and recital career lasted almost three decades. He became known as one of the world's leading heldentenors, particularly renowned for his performances as Tristan. At his best in the 1920s and 1930s and 1940s, Lorenz possessed a powerful, ringing voice which he used in an impassioned manner. Some of his recordings of operatic arias have been issued on CD. Notably, he was recorded live in a performance of Die Meistersinger at the Bayreuth Festival (1943), under the baton of Furtw√§ngler; and, in a performance of G√∂tterd√§mmerung, also at Bayreuth (1952), under the baton of Josef Keilberth. He was also a notable Otello, Bacchus and Herod.  Personal life  Lorenz was homosexual, but from 1932 he was married to Charlotte (Lotte) Appel, who was Jewish and was aware of his homosexuality. His homosexuality was mostly tolerated by the Nazis as a well-known secret. When Lorenz had to appear in court because of an affair with a young man, Joseph Goebbels advised Winifred Wagner, the director of the Bayreuth Festival, that Lorenz would not be suitable for the Festival. Wagner answered that in that case she might close the Festival because, without Lorenz, \\"Bayreuth can't be done.\\" Documentary, 45 mins., Wagner's Mastersinger, Hitler's Siegfried: The Life and Times of Max Lorenz As for his Jewish wife, Lorenz insisted on being open about his marriage, which was taken as a provocation by the Nazis. When Lorenz was away from his house, the SS burst in and tried to take his wife and mother-in-law away. At the last moment, they were prevented from doing so when Lotte Lorenz was able to make a phone call to the sister of Hermann G√∂ring. The SS was ordered to leave their residence and not to bother the two women. G√∂ring stated in a letter of 21 March 1943 that Lorenz was under his personal protection and that no action should be taken against him, his wife, or her mother.

They are currently members of the . History Blidworth Welfare was initially formed in 1926 as Folk House Old Boys F.C., but changed to Blidworth Welfare F.C. in 1982. Since 2008, the club has played in the Central Midlands League. They first entered the FA Cup in the 1993‚Äì94 season. In the beginning Folk House Old Boys Football Club was formed in 1926 with the intentions being that it gave local miners and residents a football club in which they could play organised and competitive matches against other local football clubs. Change to Blidworth Welfare FC The 1982-83 season was a big one for the club as they changed their name to Blidworth Welfare FC and became founding members of the newly formed Northern Countries East League, a competition founded from the merging of the old Midlands Counties league and the Yorkshire League. Blidworth joined the Division One South of the NCEL when it was recognised starting in the 1984-85 season and then twelve months later the club joined the NCEL Division Three following further re-organisation of the leagues. The 1986-87 season saw the club leave the NCEL to join the Central Midlands League starting in their Premier Division, the move was a successful one as the club were soon promoted to the Supreme Division in 1990. The 1990s and the FA England National Team Invitation In 1994 Blidworth were promoted back to the Northern Counties East League for the following 94-95 season where they competed in Division One. It did not last long though as the club were relegated back to the Central Midlands Supreme Division at the end of the 97-98 season as they finished bottom. They lost all 28 league games, conceding 186 goals and scoring only eight in that season, a campaign so bad that The FA invited them to a training session with the England national football team.BBC News ‚Äì Mission Impossible The club were invited to the FA's Lilleshall Centre of Excellence for a tour of the facilities and then the afternoon of training from England's coaches. John Slater was in charge for the 1998-1999 season as the club were relegated to the lowest point of the football pyramid, the Central Midlands Premier Division. Slater resigned and the club were close to folding. At the last minute the club was rescued thanks to the efforts of Steve Spencer, who after initially spending time maintaining the ground decided to take over as the new first team manager. His efforts kept the club alive but despite the club boasting facilities capable of being used at a much higher level, the club struggled to attract the players to match it. 2000-10 In 2001, a local influential manager called Rudy Funk was appointed as the new first team manager by incoming chairman Alan Whitworth as the pair set about the task of turning the club around both on and off the field. The following two seasons were a successful re-building operation but Funks departed in 2003 and Blidworth returned to struggling in both league and cup competitions for a number of seasons under a number of different management teams. The club gained silverware in 2007 when under the management of Dave Hughes the club won the Nottinghamshire Intermediate Cup beating Bulwell FC 2-0 at Hucknall Town's Watnall Road Ground in April. In 2007 the Central Midlands league was reshuffled which saw Blidworth move to the Supreme Division and again under the management of Dave Hughes the club reached the final of the Quartet Catering League Cup where they were unfortunate to lose 1-0 in extra time to Dunkirk. This defeat followed an extraordinary cup run where Blidworth beat holders of the cup Heanor Town, league leaders and champions elect Askern Welfare plus Holbrook Miners Welfare in the semi final. After two successful seasons at the helm, Dave Hughes reluctantly resigned as manager of the first team before the start of the 2008-09 season after his brother Rob was attacked whilst on holiday in Crete. The Manager felt he could not continue whilst his brother was in a serious medical condition in hospital. This resulted in Chairman Alan Whitworth appointing the management duo of Kevin Chappell & Keith Easom, assisted by ex-Blidworth player Simon Ward. The pair had previously worked together at Shirebrook Town looking after the Reserve & A sides. Easom had been a player at Shirebrook Town whilst Chappell had experienced football management at Worksop Town, Matlock Town, Matlock United and had been assistant to Rudy Funk during his days in charge at Blidworth. The club appointed Graeme Rodger & Chris Bullock to manage the reserve side that played in the Supreme Reserves Division of the Central Midlands League. The first team had to manage without Kev Chappell during the second part of the season as ill health forced him to leave his role at the club so Easom ran the first team virtually on his own till the end of the season and managed to keep Blidworth in the Supreme Division finishing in a very respectable 14th position with the reserves finishing in 10th. The start of season 2009-10 saw Keith Easom promote Chris Bullock to join him as assistant manager with Graeme Rodger left to run the reserves alone. Stan Matthews a qualified Level 2 coach was appointed as the under 19's manager assisted by Chris Bullock. The season also saw the removal of the old wooden tea bar at the ground that had been in place since the club began, the management team purchased a redundant porta cabin which they developed into a more usable hospitality area. In January 2010 the club's old wooden changing rooms which had not been used for a number of months for health & safety reasons were demolished and the football club moved into the cricket pavilion until their own facilities were built. Plans & funding applications were well underway for a brand new football changing facility overseen by vice chairlady Helen Wilford which were hoped to be in place for the season after. Blidworth finished in 17th place at the end of season which was a respectable position considering the lack playing staff the manager had at his disposal but after this Keith Easom, Chris Bullock and Stan Matthews resigned from their positions at the club and it was then decided not to run an under 19 side for season 2010-11. Graeme Rodger had resigned from running the reserves in Feb 2010 so players Dave Voller & Jez Wright supported by former referee Darren Wragg stepped up to run the reserve side for the remainder of the season but despite a great effort they finished bottom of the Supreme Reserve Division. 2010-present Former Southwell City and Kirkby Town Manager Brett Marshall was appointed Blidworth First Team Manager for season 2010-11 assisted by Steve Roebuck. Marshall has had a successful playing career at clubs such as Retford United and can count Blidworth as one of his old teams. Ambitious to progress with a good knowledge of the game with the ability & reputation to attract the right players Blidworth were hoping Marshall's appointment would see them challenging for promotion at the end of the season. Former player Liam Best assisted by Darren Wragg were appointed by Marshall to run the reserve team. Best left the club after a few months due to work commitments so reserves captain Dave Voller stepped up to help Wragg to the end of the season which was a great success with the reserves finishing a credible 4th in the league whilst Marshall led the first team into runners up spot but only after a final day defeat to eventual champions Sheffield Parramore denied Blidworth the title. In July 2011 after Marshall's departure to Retford United and also the sudden departure of Chairman Alan Whitworth after 12 years at the club, Dave Voller a local & loyal servant to the club was promoted to first team manager, working alongside Mick Gould as his assistant the pair worked hard to rebuild the club from scratch bringing in a whole new squad & backroom staff. Despite this the team finished the season in 12th place in the CML South division after the league split to North & South. The reserve team was scrapped for the season due to lack of funds but on a brighter note saw the return of an under 19 squad led by Martin Bower. Bower assisted by Kevin Heathcote brought a fine squad to the club and finished the season in 6th place along with a late quarter final defeat in the under 19's shield. On 7 October 2012 the changing facilities at the new look Welfare Ground opened for use after local resident Don French took over the stalling project from Helen Wilford in September 2011 and within 10 months dug the first spade on site, a fantastic achievement for the club after nearly 3 seasons sharing the cricket pavilion. Gary Shelton joined the club as the new chairman with Dave Voller, Mick Gould and Mike Wain left to run the first team. Voller and Gould stepped down from their roles as the season began so Mike Wain brought in Richard Preston and Lee Cook to steady the ship. Wain & Preston left the club in November after a terrible start to the season leaving Cook along with Gareth Briggs & Scott McMillan the tough task of reviving the club's fortunes but unfortunately could not gain enough points to lift the club off the bottom of the table. Martin Bower & Kevin Heathcote ran the reinstated reserve team after impressing at under 19 level and finished the season in 3rd position. Season 2013/14 saw Martin Bower & Kevin Heathcote promoted to run the first team after Cook, Briggs & McMillan left the club at the end of the season for Pinxton FC. The pair introduced local youth to the team but struggled to compete in a competitive league finishing 3rd from bottom. Scott Ward left the club in November 2013 for a role at Heanor Town FC but Paul Holmes, Andy North & Andy Ellis joined the club to run an under 19 squad and the reserve team, both sides produced some great results with a youth team squad fresh from winning the Mansfield Chad Under 16 league the year before. The under 19 squad finished 2nd behind Mansfield Town in a strong league and 5th place in the reserve premier division was a fantastic achievement using under the age of 18 players. The season after saw big changes at the club, Bower & Heathcote moved to Pinxton FC and Holmes left football altogether so Rainworth MW reserve team manager Ady Smith bought his championship winning reserve squad to the Welfare Ground for the new season. Smith bought with him Ian Cotton from Sherwood Colliery to run the reserve team and the pair set about reviving the club's fortunes on the pitch. The season went well with first team finishing in an improved 7th place in the league after Smith left for Shirebrook Town midway through the season with players Rob Camm & Danny Bacon taking over. The real stars though were Cotton‚Äôs reserve team who won the Reserve Premier Division title and the Reserve League Cup but lost in extra time to Thoresby CW reserves in the President‚Äôs Cup final after extra time to deny them the treble, however Thoresby were later found to have played ineligible players in the game so the cup was handed to Blidworth by the league committee. Chairman Gary Shelton left the club on the last day of the season to pursue other interests. The season 2015/16 saw Ian Cotton‚Äôs treble winning reserve squad make the step up to challenge for honours in the CML South Division, Cotton bought in Ian Birtley to assist him and Jason Lilliman to run the reserve side, Rachael Swinney also joined the club as secretary replacing Pete Dean. Cotton‚Äôs squad adapted well finishing 6th in the league and narrowly missed out on victory in the league cup with a late 2-1 defeat to Hucknall Rolls Leisure in the final. However the highlight of the season was the fantastic run in the FA vase where Cotton‚Äôs squad beat higher league opposition twice before being made to replay St Andrews on a technicality and losing in extra time. The reserve team though struggled in the league finishing in 11th place with a very young squad before disbanding at the end of the season. Season 2016/17 started where Blidworth left off the season before with Ian Cotton and Ian Birtley in charge of the first team. Scott Ward returned to the club to help out in the backroom and Dave Voller rejoined as chairman to guide the club forward. The campaign started slowly but began to gain momentum with key players returning from injury and suspension along with the return of ex manager Michael Wain as coach. Again Blidworth fared well in the FA Vase beating higher league opponents Teversal, Shirebrook Town and Heanor Town before losing to a late goal from AFC Mansfield in the second round of the competition in front of an impressive 146 spectators at the Welfare Ground. Cotton, Wain and Birtley all left the club in February 2017 to save Cotton‚Äôs home town club Clipstone from folding so Goalkeeper Steve Smith stepped up and took over the manager‚Äôs role guiding the club to a 12 place finish. In the summer of 2017 Scott Ward and Chris Wain again started to rebuild the club from the bottom, with stability a big factor in their decision the pair appointed Lewis Saxby as first team manager after Steve Smith had stepped down from temporary charge after the last game of the season at Southwell City. Saxby brought in Dan Machin and Dan Hatfield as his assistants along with Keiran Booker as Media Manager to help promote the club. Saxby brought in a whole new squad of players to start the 2017/18 season in the CML South but promised to use the club's youth system to blood local talent in men‚Äôs football so asked Blidworth Welfare Junior chairman Adam Gullett to join his coaching staff. Saxby used the season to build a competitive squad and finished in a very respectable 7th place in a tough South division. Season 2018/19 saw Lewis Saxby, Dan Machin and Adam Gullett attempt to build on their good start to life at Blidworth by resigning most of the squad that ended the previous campaign. The introduction of a new midweek Under 21 team at the Welfare Ground managed by Lee Richardson and his coach Adam Gullett will gave the manager an avenue to blood young local talent in men‚Äôs football and support his squad on Saturdays. Saxby left Blidworth in October after 9 straight wins after being tempted by Rainworth MW to try his luck at step 6, most of the squad left with the manager so Chairman Chris Wain appointed Scott Rogers as the new first team manager assisted by Danny Staley and Richard Hannigan who brought in a young team to fight the cause until the end of the season finishing a credible 7th place in a tough CMFL South division. Season 2019/20 sees young local manager Scott Rogers in charge at the Welfare Ground for what will be his first full season at the club. Richard Hannigan will again assist Rogers and joining the management team as coach is Dean Mitchell. All three will attempt to produce a young team that can be competitive in the CMFL. The club will compete in the South division along with the FA Vase, league cup, Floodlit Cup and the Nottinghamshire Senior Cup.

Today, these four districts combined together are also known as ‚ÄòEastern Nagaland‚Äô. History The Tuensang area was originally made up of all the present four districts of Eastern Nagaland. Even after the British conquest of India, the Tuensang tribal region remained unadministered due to lack of sufficient men and money. However, in 1902, the area was brought under the nominal control of the British. It was called Tribal Area and was administered by the Governor General of India. In 1948, a separate division called Tuensang Administrative Circle was created. When the Constitution of India was first released in 1950, Tuensang Division was placed in \\"Part B\\" category of tribal districts as per the Sixth Schedule. It became part of the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). Subsequently, in 1957, it was merged with the Naga Hills District to form a new administrative unit under the Ministry of External Affairs.

Despite not being a violation of the rules of basketball, \\"ball-hogging\\" is generally considered unacceptable playing behavior at all levels of basketball competition. The term is highly subjective, and any individual player might be considered a ball hog by some observers but not by others. Ball-hogging usually involves excessive shooting of difficult shots, especially when other players are in advantageous positions. Ball hogs attempt to monopolize their play of the ball, frequently dribbling excessively and infrequently passing the ball to a teammate. Ball- hogging tends to manifest itself statistically as an abnormally high percentage of team shot attempts by the ball hog and often low percentages of shot accuracy and assists. They also tend to have a very poor assist-to- turnover ratio, used as the main statistical indicator of how well a player \\"shares\\" the ball. Ball-hogging can be detrimental to a team both immediately and in the long term. For instance, a player with ball-hogging tendencies may overlook or neglect a teammate who is open for a relatively easy shot, choosing instead to take a more difficult shot himself, often at the team's expense. Additionally, repeated ball-hogging by a player can damage a team's cohesiveness and alienate the player from his teammates, coaches, and fans. Another example of a ball hog is a player whose aim is to boost his statistics. This could be done even through assists. A player who tries to do the most of everything - holding the ball and executing all the plays, from scoring to assisting, when it is detrimental to the outcome of the game - can also be known as a ball hog. In professional leagues, when an exceptionally competent player takes control of the ball a large amount of the time, but it is in the team's best interest due to the player's very high shot percentage and low turnover rate, and low availability of similarly skilled players on the team, he is not usually considered a ball hog. The expectation of a professional team is to play in the manner which will produce the most team wins, which will naturally lead to an imbalance among teammates of differing skill levels. However, in amateur and children's basketball, monopolizing the ball is often considered unsportsmanlike regardless of the effect it has on the team's wins. A gym class variation of a ball hog is a student who wants to handle the ball when it is unnecessary, i.e. a student who intercepts a between-play pass such as returning a ball to a pitcher or volleyball server for a new pitch or serve. The ball hog will intercept the pass from another player so he or she can hand the ball to the pitcher or server.

Cuba's meteorological institute has 15 provincial offices. They share data with US scientists and project storm tracks. Around 72 hours before a storm's predicted landfall, national media issue alerts while civil protection committees check evacuation plans and shelters. Hurricane awareness is taught in schools and there are practice drills for the public before each hurricane season. State-run television and the civil defense authority broadcast to the population with information and instructions about what measures to take. Each residential block has a person assigned to take a census on who is being evacuated to which shelter, with special attention paid to the elderly and pregnant women, and as efforts are organized locally, compliance is increased. The response system has four stages. In Stage I, which takes place 72 hours before landfall, the Civil Defense Structure is placed on an alert, and the media begins broadcasting warnings of the impending storm. At Stage II, 48 hours before the storm, the DCN (National Civil Defense) in each municipality or zone begins to organize hurricane preparation efforts, such as sending students home from schools. Shelters are inspected and supplied, and evacuations begin. Once the hurricane makes landfall, Stage III begins, during which the media continues to provide coverage of the hurricane, and the DCN attempts to maintain lines of communication. After the hurricane has passed, Stage IV begins, and people return to their homes, after they have been certified as sound by the DCN. Rescue operations and tallies of damages begin.

Directed by Fernando Trueba, Two Much stars Antonio Banderas, Melanie Griffith, Daryl Hannah and Danny Aiello. It was released in the United States by Touchstone Pictures and Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer in other countries. Lew Soloff performed music for the film. Plot Art Dodge (Antonio Banderas), a former artist, is struggling to make ends meet with his art gallery, ignoring bills and delaying to pay his assistant Gloria (Joan Cusack) and his artist Manny (Gabino Diego). To survive, he is reading the obituaries and trying to convince the widows that the deceased purchased a painting shortly before dying. Things take an ugly turn when Art is trying this scam with mobster Gene (Danny Aiello) whose father just died. Not only does Gene not fall for it, but he tries to have his henchmen beat Art up. Art barely escapes by hiding in the Rolls Royce of Betty Kerner (Melanie Griffith), Gene's estranged two-time ex-wife and wealthy heiress. Betty is excited about helping the handsome stranger, and the two end up shortly thereafter making love. Betty being very impulsive, she wants to marry Art in two weeks. Because of the heiress fortune the news immediately makes the tabloids. Stuck between Betty who won't change her mind and Gene who still loves his ex-wife, Art doesn't like the idea of getting married with such short notice but decides to play along for now. One morning, at Betty's mansion, Art seductively enters her shower naked, only to realize it's not Betty who's in there but her sister Liz (Daryl Hannah), an art professor. If Art is attracted to Liz, she stays very cold and distant, seeing him as nothing more than a gigolo who hit the jackpot. Art decides to invent a fake twin brother Bart (who wears glasses and has his hair down instead of wearing a ponytail) who is allegedly a painter who just got back from Italy. Bart and Liz instantly hit it off while Gene still tries to romance Betty. Bart and Liz can't stop talking about everything, he plays with her dog and even invites her to Manny's studio when he's not in, pretending to show her his art. When Liz's favorite painting in the studio turns out to have been actually made by Art (who gave it to Manny as an \\"advance\\" on what he owes him), Bart gives her the painting. Thanks to his imaginary twin brother, Art manages to pursue a romance with both sisters. Because the two \\"twin brothers\\" must never be in the same place at the same time, it however involves a lot of running around, coming up with a lot of excuses and enlisting a very reluctant Gloria's help. One evening he needs to go out two separate dates with both Betty and Liz. At the restaurant with Betty, he decides to drug her wine, much to the horror of the sommelier (Vincent Schiavelli). This allows him to cut the date short and put a very sleepy Betty to bed. He then goes out with Liz (who chooses the very same restaurant) and ends up making love to her. The next morning, Art/Bart has to run back and forth between the two sister's bedrooms (whose two bathrooms share a private swimming pool) as he's supposed to be with them both at the same time. In the evening before the wedding, Art spots Gene's two henchmen around his house and manages to escape them thanks to his dad's help (Eli Wallach). He tries to spend the night at Gloria's but he discovers she started dating Manny. Manny however gives him the keys to his studio where he can spend the night. At the studio, Art starts to paint again when he is interrupted by Gene's henchmen who found him and start beating him up, before Gene shows up. When Art proposes Gene to leave town, Gene tells him to go ahead with the wedding and threatens to break one bone for each tear Betty cries. After they leave, Liz arrives to the studio, thinking Bart got beat up. When Bart tells her he is Art, that he fell in love when he saw her in the shower and tries to kiss her, Liz thinks Art is trying to make a pass at her, not realizing Bart doesn't exist. On the wedding day, Liz tells Bart his \\"brother\\" tried to kiss her, and that the wedding should be called off. Bart needs to \\"confront\\" Art in a study alone, with Liz and Gene listening outside -and, unbeknownst to anyone, also by Betty through the phone. When Gene enters the study, he confronts a lonely Art, and again threatens him if he doesn't marry Betty. He tells him that what Art or even himself want is irrelevant, and that the only thing that matters is Betty's happiness. During the wedding ceremony, Betty, shaken by Gene's selfless devotion, calls the wedding off and falls in Gene's arms acknowledging she still love him too. Gene and Betty elope. In the general confusion, Liz sees her dog wanting to play with Art and realizes Art and Bart are the same person. Bart then goes to see Liz, telling her a fake excuse to \\"go back to Italy\\" (which she of course doesn't buy), adding he's not worthy of her. A few months later, Art's gallery has experienced a dramatic turnaround (Gloria owns and manages it, and Art is the artist) and is now very successful. At the inauguration of his work, Art notices Liz who still has feeling for him but is not sure who he is really. Art manages to convince her he is the one she had feelings for, and the movie ends with the two happily walking in the street, hand in hand.

The first section, known as the Western Freeway, is a four- to six-lane freeway that runs from U.S. Route 17 (US 17) in Suffolk east to the Pinners Point Interchange, which was its previous terminus. However, when the extension to the Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway opened in December 2016, the terminus was relocated to an interchange with Interstate 264. Although SR 164 is a freeway, bicycles and pedestrians, but not mopeds, are allowed over the West Norfolk Bridge between West Norfolk Road and a pair of special ramps to Bayview Boulevard and Florida Avenue. Route description View west along SR 164 in Portsmouth SR 164 begins as a pair of two-lane flyover ramps from southbound US 17 (Bridge Road) and to northbound US 17, in the direction of the James River Bridge, in the Belleville area of the independent city of Suffolk. Eastbound SR 164 receives another ramp from US 17, then the freeway meets I-664 (Hampton Roads Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange that includes a flyover ramp from southbound I-664 to eastbound SR 164. Just east of the interchange, the eastbound carriageway crosses over the Commonwealth Railway, which settles into the media of SR 164. The state highway has a partial diamond interchange with SR 135 (College Drive) that allows access to the crossroad to and from the direction of Portsmouth, which the freeway enters immediately to the east of the interchange. SR 164 and the railroad pass to the north of the community of Churchland, which is served via a diamond interchange with Towne Point Road and a partial cloverleaf interchange with Cedar Lane. East of Cedar Lane, a spur of the Commonwealth Railway splits to the north to serve the Port of Virginia's Virginia International Gateway terminals while the main line exits the median and begins to parallel the south side of the freeway. Truck access to the terminal is provided by a diamond interchange with Virginia International Gateway Boulevard. Within the West Norfolk neighborhood, SR 164 crosses the railroad and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with West Norfolk Road. The state highway crosses the Western Branch Elizabeth River on the West Norfolk Bridge, which passes through an S-curve as it crosses the channel of the river then parallels the shore of the residential Port Norfolk neighborhood. SR 164 expands to six lanes at the south end of the river crossing part of the bridge. East of the bridge, the freeway enters the actual Port Norfolk, which is accessed via ramps with Railroad Avenue within the Pinners Point Interchange where US 58 is exiting the Midtown Tunnel. After the interchange, SR 164 East and US 58 west both continue south as the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway, connecting to London Boulevard in a full interchange, where it loses its US 58 concurrency. It then continues through a partial interchange at High Street before the ending with a full interchange at I-264/US 460 Alternate. History In 1968, Congress passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, which expanded the Interstate Highway System by . The Commonwealth Transportation Board resolved in its August 1968 meeting to apply for five new stretches of Interstate: the future I-195 and I-664 plus an expansion of the Berkley Bridge on I-264 were submitted to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and approved, while two other segments were instead built as SR 164 and SR 288. AASHTO has no record of Virginia ever making a formal application to add SR 164 to the Interstate system from 1968 through the 1978 opening of the Elizabeth River bridge. The still-unbuilt road was first referred to as SR 164 in 1971. Exit list All exits are unnumbered.

The Suisunes' main village, Yulyul, is believed to be where Rockville, California is located today. Father Abella, visitor to the tribe in 1811, indicated they resided in the present location of Fairfield, north of the Suisun Bay.Milliken 1995:255. One of the Suisunes' primary food sources was acorns. Their diet also included fish as well as miner's lettuce. Their huts (as recorded by the Spaniards in 1817) were conical wikiups made of rushes or tule thatch. History The Suisunes were one tribe of the Patwin Indians, who were the southern branch of the Wintun group, who had lived in the region for up to 4000 years. Few records have been handed down; approximately 2500-5000 Patwins existed in all. =Mission Era= By 1800, Spain had taken control of most of the Bay Area, having erected seven missions in the Ohlone region south and west of the Suisunes' region. The closest mission to the Suisunes was across the San Francisco Bay, Mission San Francisco de As√≠s. Franciscan missionaries wanted to bring all tribes into the Spanish-controlled missions, pueblos and presidios, however the Spanish had not yet reached north of the present-day Carquinez Strait to the Suisunes. The Suisunes lived sufficiently far away from the first missions to rebel from the incoming Spaniards, and over time they joined with the other Patwin tribes in the central valley region to resist the incursion on their lands and maintain their freedom. They acquired horses from mission runaways and mission outposts. The Suisunes might have avoided contact for several more decades with the missionaries, however in the early 19th century, Indian runaways from the missions began to seek shelter with the Suisunes. The missions would send Mission Indians to round up \\"Christian\\" runaways. The interaction set in motion a chain of Indian battles and growing distrust. =Battles= *In 1804, 14 Mission Indians identified as Saclan and Jalquin ventured into the Suisun homeland to recapture mission runaways, and were either killed or died in an unfortunate drowning accident. The facts are unclear. The mission statement of their deaths included this note: \\"It is not possible to affirm whether they died by drowning or at the hands of the pagans (i.e., the Suisunes)... I am inclined to believe they died by drowning. If the pagans (Suisunes) had killed them, their relatives would have told me about it.\\"Milliken 1995:181. *By the year 1807, 62 runaways from the missions lived in the regions of Suisunes. In February 1807, 40 Mission Indians ventured in Suisun territory looking for January runaways, particularly to reclaim one man's wife. The runaways fought for their freedom, the Suisunes defending them. 12 of the attacking Mission Indians died, the rest retreated. *In May 1810, three more traveling Mission Indians were killed by Suisunes. In retribution, the Spaniard Gabriel Moraga led an attack on 125 Suisunes and \\"a fierce battle took place\\". 125 Suisun men in this battle were driven into three huts and killed. Two huts of men died in battle, one hut was consumed by fire. The soldiers returned to San Francisco with \\"6 boys and 6 girls of Suisuns and Chupcans.\\"Milliken 1995:210. =Migration= The next year in 1811, perhaps due to the loss of 125 men, a large group of Suisunes gave up the resistance and moved into Mission San Francisco de As√≠s in present-day San Francisco. A total of 326 Suisunes were baptized at this mission between 1810 and 1816. =Village perishes= In 1817, Jose DeArguello, the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco sent his lieutenant Jose Sanchez to lead another attack against the Suisun tribe, believed to have taken place in the hills behind Benicia. The Spaniards subsequently gained ground in present-day Fairfield and Suisun City today, reaching the Suisun village of Chief Malica, sachem of the tribe. At this village, probably with imminent defeat of his people, Chief Malica and the majority of the tribe chose to end their lives in a tragic mass suicide. The Spaniards witnessed the village's brushy huts burst into flames. The chief chanting and singing, leapt into the flames, followed by the people of the village, including the women with children and babies. The Spaniards tried to save some while several Indians fled into the hills. The remaining tribe survived in the hills or through assimilation, reemerging under the leadership of Chief Sem-Yeto, also known as Chief Solano. =Era of Chief (Sem-Yeto) Solano 1823-1850s= Sem-Yeto (later known as Chief Solano), born about 1800, emerged as the next in line to be the chief of the next generation of Suisunes. Sem-Yeto was described as tall, 6 feet 7 inches, handsome and brave. Sem-Yeto was baptized in the San Francisco Mission in July 1810 at roughly age 10 with the name \\"Francisco Solano\\" and lived there until adulthood. He became known as Chief Solano. His baptism took place 2 months after the tragedy of 1810. Sem-Yeto was possibly captured as a child in Moraga's raid of 1810 or his family brought him within two months of the battle. In 1823, Sem-Yeto and the Suisun people at Mission San Francisco moved into the new mission in the town of Sonoma, California, the Mission San Francisco de Solano, to help build and populate this final Franciscan mission built north of the San Francisco Bay. In 1834, General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo of Sonoma, as the comandante of the new pueblo projects in the region, became a very valuable patron and friend to Chief Solano, and formed an alliance with the Suisunes. The mission system was closing down. Chief Solano and the Suisunes led many expeditions with the object of quelling the other tribes of the region, particularly \\"the Wappo, the Satisyomis (aka Sotoyomes, a Wappo tribe)Lewis & Co., 1891. Source mentions the Satisyomis were generally known as the Guapo. This would be the Wappo. and the Cainameros (aka the Pomo Indians of Cainama in the region toward Santa Rosa)\\", who were attempting to throw off Mexican domination. Chief Solano eventually helped to secure peace between the region's Native Americans and the Mexicans. A peace treaty was signed in 1836. With the alliance with General Vallejo, the tribe was relatively powerful. On a political venture, Vallejo even arranged for and sent Chief Solano and 100 warrior Suisunes to travel down to Monterey, California to impress and seek military support from Juan Bautista Alvarado, governor of Alta California (1836‚Äì1837, 1838‚Äì1842).Fink 1972:74-75. In 1837, a smallpox epidemic decimated the native population of the Sonoma region, as well as from other diseases brought in from the Spaniards as well as the Russians at Fort Ross.Cook 1976:213-214.Silliman, 2004. Chief Solano was one of the few natives to receive a vaccination. Chief Solano was also one of a handful of natives to receive a land grant in the mission secularization and parcelling out of Mexican-American lands. The Suisunes who survived the epidemic began to earn their livelihoods through farm labor or fishing. Some chose to work as seasonal or year-round ranch labors for Vallejo at the Rancho Petaluma Adobe or other area ranches. In 1846, at the end of the Bear Flag Revolt when California was ceded to the United States, General Vallejo was taken prisoner by Americans at Sutter's Fort, Sem-Yeto fled north, and the people continued to earn their living on the ranches of California.

The marsh land is part of the San Francisco Bay tidal estuary, and subject to tidal ebb and flood. The marsh is home to many species of birds and other wildlife, and is formed by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers between Martinez and Suisun City, California and several other smaller, local watersheds. Adjacent to Suisun Bay, the marsh is immediately west of the legally defined Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as well as part of the San Francisco Bay estuary. The Suisun Marsh is named for the Suisunes, a Patwin sub-tribe, who inhabited the area around 200 years ago. Overview Suisun Marsh, 116,000 acres (470 km2) of land, bays, and sloughs, is one of the largest estuarine marshes in the western United States. Geologically, the Suisun Marsh is the product of water-borne sediment deposition, carried from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers into the San Francisco Bay. This process‚Äîthe weathering of the parent rock of the Sierra Nevada and Vaca Mountains, transport of the weathered material via rivers and creeks, and ultimate deposition into San Francisco Bay‚Äîhas taken place over thousands of years and has resulted in the patchwork nature of the marsh. The marsh areas consist of peat soils formed by the decay of emergent plants over time. Originally, Suisun Marsh was a vast stretch of tidal wetlands broken by branching tidal channels and ponds. The area alternately flooded and drained with the rise and fall of the tides. In winter, the ponds supported high numbers of migratory waterfowl. From the years of the Gold Rush to about 1880, the marsh was extensively used by market hunters to provide fresh waterfowl and feathers to San Francisco markets. From the 1880s until the 1930s, however, this area was gradually converted to agriculture, made possible by the construction of levees and dikes to hold back the water. Eventually, increasing soil salinity made cultivation and even cattle grazing unprofitable and cultivation ceased on all wetland areas. Most of the marsh was then purchased by public and private interests as habitat for waterfowl, mainly to support hunting. Later, the construction of water development projects (specifically, the federal Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin watersheds altered the natural salinity regime of the marsh, making it more saline. In an effort to maintain the wetlands, the marsh landowners sought legislation to preserve the area from residential or commercial development. In addition, they pursued relief from the impacts of the water projects on the salinity regime of the marsh. As a result, the parties entered into agreements to offset the impacts of the water projects on the managed wetlands. Today, Suisun Marsh supports a diversity of fish, wildlife and plants, including a large population of river otters, a number of native fish species, and birds ranging from marsh wrens to American white pelicans. Rush Ranch has only been recently acquired and is managed for both historic and biological values.A VR of the Center of Rush Ranch Retrieved January 28, 2018. However, its habitats are being enhanced and many tidal marsh plants and animals can be seen there. Rush Ranch is a 2070-acre (8.4 km2) remnant tidal marsh preserve within Suisun Marsh that was acquired for wildlife habitat and public access to the marsh by the Solano County Farmlands and Open Space Foundation in 1988. The non-profit organization, dedicated to protect and preserve farmland, ranchland and open space in Solano County, has since been renamed Solano Land Trust. A component of the Solano Land Trust located at Rush Ranch is the Rush Ranch Educational Council, more commonly known as RREC. RREC is an all volunteer, non-profit organization that offers an educational program to 3rd and 4th grade students who visit the ranch on field trips. The program is offered at no charge, made possible by a grant from the Nature Conservancy in partnership with the Solano Land Trust. The program‚Äîdesigned to meet California K-12 education standards for history-social studies‚Äîteaches children about the original inhabitants of the ranch, the Patwin Indians, on a recreated Patwin village located on the ranch. The interactive program is divided into six stations, each focused on a facet of Patwin culture and daily life. At these stations, RREC docents use replicated tools and materials to demonstrate the ways in which the Patwins were able to thrive and ensure generational survival using seasonally available resources and by employing sustainable harvesting and natural resource conservation. Another public part of the marsh is Grizzly Island Wildlife Area which is managed primarily for waterfowl, although over 230 species of birds have been seen here as well as many mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and fish. Grizzly Island has an unusually dense population of river otters, which can be seen swimming in its numerous sloughs, ponds, and roadside ditches. In the fall, the Grizzly Island Wildlife Area herd of tule elk breeds. The bugling of bull elk can be heard especially in the early morning and evening. Access to certain areas of the Wildlife Area is limited during the first nine days of pheasant hunting season around November, and on Wednesdays and Saturdays during the waterfowl hunting season from October through January. Recent studies by the CALFED Suisun Marsh Levee Investigation demonstrate that the current configuration of the 230 miles of levees in the Marsh prevent salinity intrusion into the freshwater of the Delta used by 22 million people for drinking water.Suisun Marsh Facts . Environmental Services Office, Department of Water Resources, State of California. Flooded ponds Schedule for flooding ponds during the fall hunting season, then leaching, and finally drying them during the summer. As noted above, the dikes, or levees, of Suisun Marsh were originally built by nineteenth century farmers seeking to create farmland from tidal marsh. While this system is still in use on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta islands to the east, it failed in the Suisun Marsh due to unacceptably high soil salinities. Portions of the marsh were subsequently converted from farming to permanently and seasonally flooded wetlands in the twentieth century. Today, approximately 230 miles of levees maintain seasonally and permanently flooded wetlands. Between approximately mid-October and mid-January, managed seasonal wetlands are flooded to a depth of 8 to 12 inches to attract waterfowl. The rest of the year, the ponds are flooded and drained on a schedule designed to optimize conditions for plants which provide seeds preferred by waterfowl, namely alkali bulrush, fat hen, and brass buttons. Ponds left flooded through at least the spring provide brood rearing habitat. The flood-and-drain cycle is also designed to minimize soil salinity by leaching and flushing salts. Today, this flood management program also supports plants such as tules, cattails, saltgrass, and pickleweed, which may not yield preferred waterfowl food seeds, but do provide habitat for invertebrates important to pre-breeding waterfowl and other wildlife. When Suisun agricultural lands reverted to wetlands, they provided habitat for waterfowl displaced decades earlier by reclamation. In addition, the presence of these \\"new\\" wetlands eased waterfowl crop depredation in the Central Valley. It also provided habitat no longer available in the Central Valley due to extensive reclamation for agriculture and urbanization. By about 1930, waterfowl hunting had become the primary use of the Suisun Marsh. It is the dominant use today, with 158 private duck clubs and large public hunting areas. Water management Montezuma Slough, to the north and east of Grizzly Island, is the key to wetland management. Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates, open to allow freshwater into the Montezuma Slough. The wetland managers for both the private hunting clubs and the state's public land take water from major and minor sloughs throughout the marsh. Montezuma Slough, one of the largest, is open at both ends, and its flood tide current is longer and stronger than its ebb tide current, causing a net west-to-east flow which draws higher saline water eastward from Grizzly Bay. The flood tide pushing through the slough takes half an hour longer to traverse the marsh than does the matching flood tide following the more direct route in the main Suisin Bay channel.Tide Location Selection for California Retrieved June 28, 2018. Thus, high tide at the east end of the slough arrives out of phase with high tide in the main channel, and rather than being pushed back, as it would be in the main channel or in a dead-end slough, the slough water keeps flowing eastward, drawing more saline water with it. To meet the salinity requirements stipulated by the California Water Resources Control Board to support \\"beneficial uses\\" in Decision-1485, the California State Water Project and the federal Central Valley Project built the Montezuma Slough Salinity Control Gates. They began operation in 1989. The gates span Montezuma Slough near the Roaring River intake and are periodically operated from October to May to meet the more recently established salinity standards set by Decision-1641, to block the salty flood tide from Grizzly Bay but allow passage of the freshwater ebb tide from the mouth of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Because the Salinity Control Gates are more effective than anticipated other proposed salinity control measures were abandoned. The gates operate as needed from October through May. Fish Although the Suisun Marsh is managed for waterfowl, it is also an important fish habitat, especially for wild salmon. Monitoring stations throughout the marsh measure the impact of water management activities on fish populations, and fish screens prevent the diversion and entrapment of fish in the waterfowl ponds. The Marsh supports 80% of the state's commercial salmon fishery by providing important tidal rearing areas for juvenile fish allowing them to grow twice as fast as those reared in the upper watershed, thus, greatly enhancing their survival. And is an important area for native fishes including the delta smelt which is protected by the federal Endangered Species Act. Flora Suisun Marsh is home to the only two known occurrences of the Suisun thistle, Cirsium hydrophilum var. hydrophilum, a variety of thistle which is a federally listed endangered species.California Native Plant Society: Cirsium hydrophilum var. hydrophilum The Suisun thistle is perennial and stays in its juvenile stages of life until it is ready to flower and once the rosette reaches its mature phase it can take up to a year or more to develop the leafy stem.

While with Watford he scored in three successive games after coming off the substitutes bench, greatly helping the club's escape from the relegation zone. Bailey was loaned to Brentford in January 1995, before signing for Gillingham in August of the same year, helping them win promotion from Division Three that season. He subsequently played for Lincoln City, before moving into non-league football for a second spell with Farnborough Town. He then moved on to play for Cheltenham Town, Forest Green Rovers, League of Wales side Aberystwyth Town, Tamworth, Stafford Rangers, Moor Green and Stratford Town. He retired as a player in November 2006. He then went on to do coaching, often helping coach a Saturday morning football group in Monkspath in the West Midlands. In 2011, Bailey was coaching and playing for his local church team, Renewal Christian Centre in Solihull, in the West Midlands Christian Football League.

The film is conceived as a documentary, but incorporates lengthy sections of experimental films produced by the filmmakers. The premise is that von Trier has created a challenge for his friend and mentor, J√∏rgen Leth, another renowned filmmaker. Lars von Trier's favorite film is Leth's The Perfect Human, and von Trier gives Leth the task of remaking The Perfect Human five times, each time with a different \\"obstruction\\" (or obstacle) imposed by von Trier.A. O. Scott (26 May 2004). \\"The Five Obstructions (2003)  Movie Review; A Cinematic Duel of Wits For Two Danish Directors\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 15 June 2015. It has been said that \\"[b]oth this film and Dogville show a more mature von Trier, one who is more aware of and accountable to the full implications of the torture, suffering and victimization he has employed in his films, especially in exploring how easily those who victimize others in the name of righteousness become victims [of] their own self-righteousness.\\" The obstructions #Leth must remake the film in Cuba, with no set, and with no shot lasting longer than twelve frames, and he must answer the questions posed in the original film; Leth successfully completes this task. #Leth must remake the film in the worst place in the world but not show that place onscreen; additionally, Leth must himself play the role of \\"the man\\". The meal must be included, but the woman is not to be included. Leth remakes the film in the red light district of Mumbai, only partially hiding it behind a translucent screen. #Because Leth failed to complete the second task perfectly, von Trier punishes him, telling him to either remake the film in any way he chooses, or else to repeat it again with the second obstruction in Mumbai. Leth chooses the first option and remakes the film in Brussels, using split-screen effects. #Leth must remake the film as a cartoon. He does so with the aid of Bob Sabiston, a specialist in rotoscoping, who creates animated versions of shots from the previous films. As such the final product is technically an animation but not a cartoon. Nevertheless, von Trier considers the task to be completed successfully. #The fifth obstruction is that von Trier has already made the fifth version, but it must be credited as Leth's, and Leth must read a voice- over narration, ostensibly from his own perspective but in fact one written by von Trier. Collaboration with Martin Scorsese In 2010 Variety reported rumors that Lars von Trier, Martin Scorsese, and Robert De Niro planned to work on a remake of Scorsese's film Taxi Driver with the film made with same restrictions as were used in The Five Obstructions. In 2014 Paul Schrader, the screenwriter for Taxi Driver said that it was not being made. He said, \\"It was a terrible idea\\" and \\"in Marty's mind, it never was something that should be done.\\" Reception The Five Obstructions received strongly positive reviews from critics. It holds a 79/100 on Metacritic, and Rotten Tomatoes reports 88% approval among 59 critics. It was later voted one of the 30 best films of the 2000s in a poll for Sight & Sound.

It overlooks the lake of Loweswater to the south and to the north is bordered by its neighbour Fellbarrow. It is usually climbed from the villages of Loweswater or Thackthwaite. The fell is largely occupied by grassed enclosures, although there are some rocky outcrops near the top. Low Fell has fairly steep slopes to the south and east. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards, the hills diminish towards the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Low Fell and Fellbarrow stand remote from the end of the northern arm. Loweswater is unique amongst the major lakes of the District in emptying towards the centre of the National Park. Its waters flow out eastwards into Crummock Water before beginning their northward journey as the Cocker. Loweswater does not therefore represent any watershed between the fells on either side of its valley, as might be supposed from a quick glance at the map. A low ridge circuiting the western end of the lake joins Burnbank Fell to Low Fell and Fellbarrow, confirming them as the last outpost of the Western Fells. Low Fell and Fellbarrow form a ridge two miles long, with the somewhat contrarily named Low Fell being the higher. Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells was forced to estimate the elevation of Low Fell and considered it (albeit doubtfully) to be inferior to Fellbarrow. New mapping by the Ordnance Survey has now settled the issue. The lowest col on the ridge occurs immediately south of Fellbarrow, and the intervening tops are therefore usually considered satellites of Low Fell. These lower summits, working southward, are Smithy Fell (1,296 ft) and Sourfoot Fell (1,350 ft). The southern terminus of the ridge, looking down on Loweswater village, is rough on all sides, rising to a small neat top. This was considered the summit by Wainwright, although again he was unsure and ill-served by the maps of the time. Birkett refers to this 1,352 ft top as Loweswater Fell, although without any particular justification.Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): North of this point is a slight depression before the smoother and more elongated true summit. A subsidiary ridge breaks off south-west from Sourfoot Fell, crossing the slight hump of Loftbarrow before reaching Darling Fell (1,282 ft). This stands over the northern shore of Loweswater, about halfway up the lake. Between Darling Fell and Low Fell is the little valley of Crabtree Beck. In general, the western slopes of the Low Fell ridge are long and gentle, while some rock appears along the steeper eastern and southern flanks. The western boundary of the fell proper lies at Leady Moss, the low point on the connecting ridge to Burnbank Fell. From here, the Dub Beck flows into Loweswater while the Black Beck flows north-west into the River Marron. The open fellside is circumscribed by a minor road which runs from the shore of Loweswater north to Mosser. In the east, the slopes fall quickly to the cultivated lands of the broad Vale of Lorton. Raven Crag below the summit and Watching Crag on Sourfoot Fell are the main features. Geology The rocks beneath the summit are of the Loweswater Formation, composed of greywacke sandstone turbidities. Beneath this and occasionally outcropping on the eastern flanks are the laminated mudstone and siltstone of the Kirk Stile Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Summit Wainwright described the view from the lower southern top, noting that two cairns lower down the southern face gave better vantage points for the Loweswater Valley. From either summit, there are views to Grasmoor, across the Lorton Vale and down the Buttermere valley in which you can see Crummock Water and Buttermere. Both tops are marked by cairns; the true summit top being on a small outcrop amid short fell grass and large rocks. Ascents The gentlest way onto the ridge is from Thackthwaite in the Vale of Lorton. A footpath leads away from the settlement climbing to the intake wall. Beyond is a drove road, curving up the hillside to emerge at the top of Sourfoot Fell. The ridge from here is easy. An alternative start is from the Mosser road, climbing Darling Fell before joining the main ridge. Wainwright also suggests following Crabtree Beck for a direct ascent of Low Fell.

He was voiced by Peter Sellers. Basis of character Bloodnok's army career is notable for cowardice and monetary irregularities. He was discharged after being found dressed as a woman, although he claims it was carnival night. He is repeatedly implied to be a womaniser. A prime example of this is in \\"Drums Along the Mersey\\" where he is thrown out of a boat for being caught with the captain's wife. Another example is featured in \\"The Histories of Pliny the Elder\\", when he says: \\"You know that saying 'Caesar's wife is above suspicion'? Well, I put an end to all that rubbish!\\" Also, in \\"The Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI\\", when Moriarty arrives at his tent to bribe him into blowing up said NAAFI, he catches Bloodnok saying supposedly to a woman he was romancing, \\"Good night darling, I'll see you later\\", to which Milligan, playing Throat, replies \\"Good night, darling\\". In addition, during \\"Tales of Men's Shirts\\", he appears obsessed with women, answering a request for a favour with \\"What's her name?\\" Bloodnok was based on the memories of Spike Milligan who remembered an old Colonel who used to come to their shows in Italy. The Bill Hall Trio (which Spike was a member of at the time) got friendly with him and also found he was notorious at missing his wallet every time he had to pay for a round of drinks and used to make up probably exaggerated stories of his military experiences. Spike has stated in his memoirs that one night they put the Colonel in the wings, and whenever it got quiet, the Colonel shouted \\"These boys were at Cassino you know!\\" This probably got the biggest laugh of the night so Spike brought the Colonel to the Stage to take the applause. Spike was in contact with him up until the Colonel died. Regiments He introduces himself in \\"Napoleon's Piano\\" as \\"Major Denis Bloodnok, late of the 3rd Disgusting Fusiliers, OBE, MT, MT and MT\\". Seagoon questioned him on the MT's, to which Bloodnok responded \\"I get tuppence on each of them\\" (MT's meaning \\"empties\\", as in empty bottles). Also said to be a former member of the 3rd Mounted NAAFI, and the 3rd Regular Army Deserters. In \\"The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler (of Bexhill-on-Sea)\\", Major Bloodnok is officer commanding of the 56th Heavy Underwater Artillery (the real 56th Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery was Milligan's regiment during WW2). The Affair of the Lone Banana sees Bloodnok as \\"Major Bloodnok, late of Zsa Zsa Gabor's Third Regular Husbands\\". In \\"The Mummified Priest\\", when Seagoon explains that he has come to Egypt to look for the tomb of a priest belonging to the third or fourth dynasties, Bloodnok replies, \\"Fourth Dynasties? My old regiment!\\" He has also claimed to have been a member of the 3rd Heavy Nudists (\\"Oh, what a cap badge they had!\\"). It is possible that he was at one time a member of a cavalry regiment: Roper's Light Horse are mentioned in more than one episode. In \\"The Last of the Smoking Seagoons\\", Major Bloodnok hides Ned of Wales in the Bloodnok Patriotic Military Museum; in doing so, he hears the cash register's ring, and reminisces: \\"Oh, that tune how it haunts me; it's my regimental march for the Third Mounted Cash Registers, you know\\". In \\"The Fear of Wages\\", Seagoon is the commander of the Third Armoured Thunderboxes (\\"who vanished in Burma ten years ago\\"), while Bloodnok is an officer in the regiment. In \\"Dishonoured\\", Bloodnok recruits Seagoon and Eccles into the 3rd Bombay Irish to fight the Red Bladder. Running gags Denis is plagued by chronic gastro-intestinal problems and his entrance is usually accompanied by explosions or flatulent sound effects, the sound being created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop (on the one occasion it wasn't played, Bloodnok cried, \\"I'm Cured!\\") and quotes such as: :\\"The screens, nurse! Quick, the screens!\\" :\\"No wonder I can't go to parties any more...\\" :\\"No more curried eggs for me.\\" :\\"It's a river steamer! And what a steamer...\\" In \\"The Policy\\" Bloodnok sings a song called \\"The Indigestion Waltz\\". Catch phrases * \\"It's Hell in there!\\" - typically about somewhere hot, crowded etc. or his own quarters and/or latrine. * \\"I say, you're cutting it rather fine, aren't you?\\" - after another character has uttered seemingly contradictory statements. * \\"I don't know who you are sir, or where you come from, but you've done me a power of good.\\" - often shortened to \\"you've (or \\"that's\\") done me a power of good\\". In \\"The Gold Plate Robbery\\" the catchphrase was set to music. Other characters In several episodes Bloodnok has an Indian manservant called Singhiz Thing. Bloodnok's arch enemy is \\"The Red Bladder\\", voiced by musician Ray Ellington.

Personal life He was the fifth child of Jan Joseph Godfried van Voorst tot Voorst sr.‚Äîlieutenant general and president of the Senate of the Netherlands‚Äîand Anna Cremers. With his first wife, Jkvr. Octavia Ottine van Nispen tot Pannerden (1885‚Äì1947), he had six children. His second wife, Jkvr. Joanna Maria Alfrida Louisa (1910‚Äì1992), was a daughter of the Dutch Prime Minister Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck. Military career After he completed his secondary education, he was admitted to the Royal Military Academy (KMA) in Breda in 1898. In 1901, he graduated first in his class, and enlisted in an infantry regiment in Haarlem. During the general railway strikes in 1903, he was the only lieutenant in charge of a unit protecting the train station of Haarlem. In 1907, he became a personal adjutant of Queen Wilhelmina, and in this function accompanied her on various state visits. During the First World War and the mobilization of the Dutch Army, he served in various ranks. These experiences and his concerns regarding the Schlieffen Plan led him to write a study highlighting the critical importance of the province of Limburg in German strategic planning. The publication was translated into Spanish, English, French and Norwegian. In 1920, Godfried became a member of the general staff and represented the Netherlands in the disarmament conference in Geneva. In the wake of the Great Depression, he managed to restore order after the 1934 riots in Amsterdam. This was the first time that armored vehicles were deployed by the Dutch army. In 1935, he supervised the Dutch troops monitoring the 1935 plebiscite in the Saar. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he was highly critical of the \\"broken rifle\\" movement and the prevailing pacifist mentality of Dutch society and politics, which he deemed na√Øve. In later life, he would comment that this era was the low point in the history of Dutch defense. In 1936, he published a widely read book on the German rearmament an early warning against Nazi militarism. By the late 1930s, Dutch politicians finally realized that their country would not be able to remain neutral in the looming conflict with Nazi Germany. During the hasty and belated military preparations, Godfried firmly rejected the ideas of general Izaak Reijnders. Godfried warned against Blitzkrieg tactics and mechanized warfare, whereas Reijnders believed that a possible German invasion would be preceded by long political and diplomatic tensions. Although, Reinders's plans were initially adopted, his conflict with the secretary of defense Adriaan Dijxhoorn led to the resignation of the former. Since two brothers of the van Voorst tot Voorst family served in the general staff and because their Roman Catholic background was controversial among Protestants, Dijxhoorn appointed the retired general Henri Winkelman, who supported the strategic plans of Godfried. Much time was lost due to these internal arguments, and when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on May 10, 1940, the Dutch armed forces were insufficiently prepared. Godfried attempted to defend the Grebbeberg, but was ultimately forced to withdraw to the West of the Netherlands. After the Rotterdam Blitz and the German threat to annihilate other Dutch cities, he advised Winkelman to surrender. After the Battle of the Netherlands, he refused to pledge an oath of loyalty to the Nazis, and as a consequence, he was sent (together with his brother, H.F.M. Baron van Voorst tot Voorst) to a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany for the five remaining years of the war. Following the end of Nazi Germany, he returned to the Netherlands, where he assumed various military and civil positions. In 1960, on his 80th birthday, he was awarded the titular rank of general.

Development  In Germany during the late 1920s, Hans Hollmann began working in the field of microwaves, which were to later become the basis of almost all radar systems. In 1935 he published Physics and Technique of Ultrashort Waves, which was picked up by researchers around the world. At the time he had been most interested in their use for communications, but he and his partner Hans-Karl von Willisen had also worked on radar-like systems. In 1928 Hollmann, von Willisen and Paul-G√ºnther Erbsl√∂h started a company Gesellschaft f√ºr elektroakustische und mechanische Apparate (GEMA). In the autumn of 1934, GEMA built the first commercial radar system for detecting ships, similar to a system developed by Christian H√ºlsmeyer. Operating in the 50 cm range it could detect ships up to 10 km away. This early version of the system only provided a warning that a ship was in the general vicinity of the direction the antenna was pointed, it did not provide accurate direction or any sort of range information. The purpose was to provide an anti-collision system at night, in fog, and other times of limited visibility. By order of the German navy, in the summer of 1935 they developed a pulse radar with which they could spot the cruiser K√∂nigsberg at a distance of 8 km, with an accuracy of up to 50 m, enough for gun-laying. The same system could also detect an aircraft at 500 m altitude at a distance of 28 km.Earth observation portal, text on History of Earth observation (Kramer), chapter 1.2. Decadal survey, p. 81 (PDF) Radio measurement technology in Germany on www.100-jahre-radar.de, from a lecture of Dr. Wolfgang Holpp, EADS, 2004 The military implications were not lost this time around, and construction of land and sea-based versions took place as Freya radar and Seetakt. The navy's priority at that time was ranging. Detecting targets and obstacles by night or in bad weather were secondary objectives. Actually using it for gun laying, like the W√ºrzburg radar developed for the German army, was initially not a priority for the Kriegsmarine. An Open Source for this text on Greg Goebel / In The Public Domain The two systems were generally similar, although the early Seetakt systems worked on a 50 cm wavelength (600 MHz), while Freya was designed for much longer ranges and used a 2.5 m wavelength that could be generated at high power using existing electronics. These early systems proved problematic, and a new version using improved electronics at 60 cm wavelength (500 MHz) was introduced. Four units were ordered and installed on the K√∂nigsberg, Admiral Graf Spee and two large torpedo boats (which in German service were the size of small destroyers). The Admiral Graf Spee used this unit successfully against shipping in the Atlantic. In Dec. 1939, after heavy fighting during the Battle of the River Plate, the Admiral Graf Spee was severely damaged and the captain scuttled the ship in the neutral harbor off Montevideo, Uruguay. The ship sank in shallow water such that its radar antenna was still visible. These early-model Seetakt systems were followed in 1939 by a modified version known as Dete 1, operating between 71 and 81.5 cm wavelength (368 to 390 MHz) at 8 kW peak and a pulse repetition frequency of 500 Hz. Maximum range against a ship-sized target at sea was up to on a good day, though more typically half that. Performance was otherwise similar to the earlier system, with a range accuracy of about 50 m. This was considerably more accurate than the guns they ranged for, which typically had spreads of over 100 m. It was also much better than the typical optical rangefinding equipment of the era, which would typically be accurate to about 200 m at 20,000 m, albeit some German optical rangefinders were reportedly capable of 40-50 m accuracy at that range, which helps to explain why the Germans continued to rely on optics as their primary maritime range finding equipment for several years into the war.

On 20 January 2017, the HIA inquiry concluded that the abuse which took place at Kincora Boys' Home was limited to the actions of three staff members, and did not take place with the collusion of the state or intelligence services. The head of the HIA suggested that it was a matter of urgency that the victims be compensated up to ¬£100,000. In 2016, Gary Hoy, a former resident of Kincora lost a UK Supreme Court challenge to the powers of the HIA, which could not compel the UK security services to hand over documents or testify. Clint Massey, another former resident, likewise stated in 2015 that due to the scope of the allegations, the HIA was inappropriate and instead Kincora should be investigated by the Goddard Inquiry. Richard Kerr, a former resident of the institute for boys rejected the remarks made by HIA, specifically that the abuse was \\"limited to 3 staff members\\" and in February 2017 started a legal challenge to the veracity of its investigation. History The home was set up in 1958 by the local health authority to provide full-time accommodation for boys of working age (15-18) who faced an abusive or otherwise compromised home life. The Home closed in 1980 following the exposure of serious wrongdoing by staff and others, which started shortly after it opened.Dorman, Nick; O'Cleirigh, Fiona (23 March 2013). \\"Police re- open child sex abuse investigation at Kincora boys home in Belfast\\". Sunday People (London). Sex abuse=First reported= The abuse first came to public attention on 24 January 1980 with a news report in the Irish Independent: \\"Fitt to raise 'cover up' in Westminster - Sex Racket at Children's Home\\". It was reported that no prosecutions had taken place, despite allegations of abuse first surfacing in 1977 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) at Belfast's Strandtown and Donegall Pass stations giving the Director of Public Prosecutions a report detailing allegations of boys being sexually abused and prostituted, and naming prominent businessmen as being involved. On 3 April 1980 three members of staff at the home, William McGrath, Raymond Semple and Joseph Mains, were charged with a number of offences relating to the systematic sexual abuse of children in their care over a number of years; they were all convicted. Mains, who had been the warden, was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, Semple, an assistant warden, to five years, and McGrath was jailed in December 1981 for four years.\\"Kincora file conspicuously absent from government records\\", Sam McBride, News Letter 3 January 2013 =Allegations of cover-up= Allegations were later made that the RUC had been informed of the abuse at the home for years previously, but had not moved to prevent it. In his 1999 book The Dirty War, Martin Dillon claims that McGrath, who was also the leader of an obscure loyalist paramilitary group called Tara, may have been employed by MI5 since the 1960s and was being blackmailed into providing intelligence on other loyalist groups. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church which he founded in 1951, was accused of failing to report McGrath's abuse to the relevant authorities. He initially denied ever being advised by his informant, a church member, Valerie Shaw, that it was taking place. Paisley later gave other versions acknowledging learning from Shaw about McGrath's homosexuality. During this time, it was alleged by the satirical current affairs magazine Private Eye that high-ranking members of the Whitehall Civil Service and senior officers of the British military were involved in the sexual abuse of boys in Kincora. =New policy overturned= In response to increasing coverage in the media, the Eastern Health and Social Services Board decided to institute a policy of not employing \\"homosexuals\\" in any caring roles. Some people working in other homes, who weren't alleged to have participated in abuse, were discovered to be homosexual and dismissed. The policy was later overturned by the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services.Social Work, the Media and Public Relations, Bob Franklin and Nigel Parton, Routledge, 1991 =1982 and 1984 inquiries= A \\"private inquiry\\" was set up in January 1982 by James Prior, the Northern Ireland Secretary, under the Commissioner of Complaints, Stephen McGonagle, to deal with these allegations. However, it collapsed after three of its members resigned because they felt that the RUC had failed to carry out an effective investigation. Debates on Kincora were held in the Northern Ireland Assembly on 22 March and 9 November 1983. In January 1984, another inquiry, under Judge William Hughes with W.J. Patterson and Harry Whalley, was set up by James Prior.Margaret Scanlan, Plotting Terror: Novelists and Terrorists in Contemporary Fiction Judge Hughes's Committee of Inquiry into Children's Homes and Hostels submitted its 355-page report on 31 December 1985. Amongst its 56 recommendations, which related mostly to the operation of children's homes and child care regulation, was one (46) that every criminal allegation made by a resident should be referred to the police. Another (4) was that the legal position regarding the exclusion of homosexuals from employment in residential child care should be established although (p. 294) the committee concluded that \\"the weight of opinion is against a policy of exclusion\\". The news story in the Irish Times that there was a prostitution ring operating from the Kincora home (paras. 5.23‚Äì28) was stated to be unwarranted and sourced inaccurately to a witness who was never resident in Kincora and who had been abused by his uncle. That witness said (p. 200) \\"I have no knowledge of any important or influential men involved in any sex with me or any other boys.\\" Hughes concluded presciently (p. 342) that, \\"The events giving rise to this Inquiry...can no longer be regarded as exceptional. They must perhaps be recognised as earlier symptoms of a general malaise permeating the United Kingdom.\\"Hughes, W.H. (1986) Report of the Inquiry into Children's Homes and Hostels, Belfast: HMSO Joshua Cardwell, an east Belfast Unionist Party of Northern Ireland (UPNI) councillor and Stormont MP who formerly chaired the Belfast Corporation Welfare Committee responsible for children's homes, committed suicide in 1982 after making a statement to the RUC in March over Kincora. Cardwell told the police of one conversation with the Belfast Town Clerk who had mentioned an imprecise allegation of homosexual conduct, but said that no complaints had ever come his way (p. 70). The Hughes report concluded (p. 93), \\"There is no evidence that Councillor Cardwell took steps to prevent an investigation or suppress the matter. Nor is there any evidence that the Ministry of Home Affairs became aware of allegations or rumours of relating to homosexual misconduct at Kincora.\\" =Later revelations= In April 1990 a writer called Robert Harbinson (also known as Robin Bryans) stated in the Dublin-based magazine Now that Lord Mountbatten, Anthony Blunt and others were all involved in an old-boy network which held gay orgies in country houses on both sides of the Irish border, as well as at the Kincora Boys' Home. Harbinson sent letters and postcards to the rich and powerful in British establishment circles but once the postcards began to circulate there were complaints to the police and Harbinson was warned that he would be prosecuted for criminal libel.Chris Moore, The Kincora Scandal, Marino Books (1996) An example of his letter-writing style is copied here. The Belfast News Letter reported that files on Kincora were \\"conspicuously absent\\" from the routine January 2013 release of 1982 government papers by the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) under the 30-year rule. In July 2014 former military intelligence officer Colin Wallace said that any new investigation into the abuse at the home should have access to information from intelligence agencies. Wallace said that he received intelligence in 1973 that boys at the home were being abused, but some of his superior officers refused to pass on information. He also said that the Terry and Hughes inquiries did not examine evidence relating to the intelligence services. In August 2014 another former intelligence officer, Brian Gemmell, said that he also had been ordered to stop investigating allegations of abuse at the home. He said that he learned details of what happened in the home while gathering information on loyalists. He was told he was running two agents who had close links to the home. As well as telling him not to investigate, the senior officer told him to stop running an agent. He had spoken out anonymously before, but dropped his anonymity because he wanted the allegations to be investigated again. It was alleged that extreme Ulster loyalists who were members of a paedophile ring committing offences at the Home were being blackmailed by MI5 and other branches of the security forces during the Troubles. In 2015 campaigners were trying to have Kincora included in a wide-ranging inquiry to establish whether the security services prevented action on the abuse so they could compromise some of the perpetrators. =Legal proceedings= Until 2015, there had been no court hearing about the alleged cover-up with British state involvement, a cover-up that was alleged by victims to have lasted decades. An Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in England and Wales was being set up at the time following revelations of widespread abuse in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile revelations. However, the government intended to keep Kincora out of this process and within the remit of the HIA inquiry only. The Northern Ireland victims wanted a similar inquiry into their case, with fuller powers to compel witnesses to testify, and require the security service to provide documents, then available to the HIA. On 17 February 2015 the High Court in Northern Ireland listed a full judicial review into the decision to keep Kincora out of the wider inquiry, which was heard in the first week of June 2015.McDonald, Henry (17 February 2015).\\"Belfast boys' home abuse victims win legal bid\\". The Guardian (London). On 20 January 2017, the HIA chairman Sir Anthony Hart dismissed claims that MI5 or any other British government agency had any role in covering up the reports of sex abuse which had occurred at Kincora and instead placed the blame on the poor investigating and reporting by the local police.

Overview Kornwerderzand is located approximately 4 kilometers from the coast of Friesland, on a former artificial island which was created during the construction of the dam. The settlement has a population of 22 (as of January 1, 2007). It is part of the municipality of S√∫dwest-Frysl√¢n. The shipping locks at Kornwerderzand, also known as the Lorentzsluizen (\\"Lorentz Locks\\"), provide access to the Wadden Sea from the IJsselmeer, and a complex of discharge sluices control the water level in the IJsselmeer. A second complex of sluices and locks is located at the other side of the Afsluitdijk, near Den Oever. History=Fortifications and military history= The Afsluitdijk provides a road link between the provinces of Friesland and North Holland. Since North Holland was part of Vesting Holland (\\"Fortress Holland\\"), the national redoubt of the Netherlands at the time, and control of the sluices in the Afsluitdijk was necessary for planned defensive inundations in case of a military invasion, Kornwerderzand was considered strategically important by the Dutch government. From 1931 onwards, fortifications consisting of seventeen casemates and three bunkers were constructed. The position was manned with approximately 220 troops in 1939. During the German invasion of the Netherlands in World War II, the Kornwerderzand position was defended by Dutch troops. On May 13 and May 14, 1940, the fortifications were attacked by the German first Cavalry Division, while the Luftwaffe attacked supporting Dutch naval units. The German troops, initially lacking support by heavy artillery, were unable to take the position. The fortifications also withstood attacks by dive bombers. The next day the Dutch military in the Netherlands (except for the province of Zealand) surrendered, and the battle ended with the surrender of the position. In 1943, the occupying German military improved the defenses by building three additional bunkers. Nowadays, some of the fortifications can be visited as part of the Kazemattenmuseum (\\"casemate museum\\"). Before 2011, the village was part of the W√ªnseradiel municipality.

It sits on the northern side of Piccadilly at number 94, in the fashionable district of Mayfair. , the property is being converted into a luxury hotel and seven residences.Former private members' club to become one of London's grandest hotels under new plans from billionaire brothers The current name of the house comes from one of its former owners, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge (1774‚Äì1850), the seventh son of King George III, but it was originally known as Egremont House and then Cholmondeley House. From about 1865 to 1999, it was the home of the Naval and Military Club and was known colloquially as the In and Out Club, due to its prominently signposted one-way carriage drive.  Early history  The house, situated in the fashionable parish of St George's, Hanover Square, Westminster, was built in 1756‚Äì1761 by Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont (1710‚Äì1763), of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset and of Petworth House in Sussex, Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1761 to 1763, and was thus first known as Egremont House. The building is in the late Palladian style, to the design of the architect Matthew Brettingham. It has three main storeys plus basement and attics, and is seven bays wide. As is usual in a London mansion of the period, the first floor (piano nobile, \\"second floor\\" in American English) is the principal floor, containing a circuit of reception rooms. This floor has the highest ceilings and its status is emphasised externally by a Venetian window in the centre. The house changed hands several times. For several years in the 1820s, it was occupied by George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley, and was known as Cholmondeley House. From 1829 to 1850, it was the London residence of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge (1774‚Äì1850), and became known as Cambridge House. Due to his royal status, that name has persisted. As Queen Victoria left the house after visiting her dying uncle Adolphus, Robert Pate hit her on the head with his cane. After the duke's death in 1850, the house was purchased by Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for most of the decade between 1855 to 1865. It was his London townhouse and the site of many splendid social and political gatherings. After Palmerston's death in 1865 at Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, his body was taken to Cambridge House, whence his funeral procession departed to Westminster Abbey. Later that year, Cambridge House was sold to the Naval and Military Club, which had outgrown its previous headquarters. The club came to be known as the \\"In and Out\\", from the prominent traffic-directing signs on its entrance and exit gates. Members included T. E. Lawrence and Ian Fleming.  Recent history  In 1999, the Naval and Military Club moved to new premises, having sold Cambridge House in 1996 to entrepreneur Simon Halabi for ¬£50 million.Sunday Times. Rich List 2004 Halabi planned to convert the property into a private members' club and hotel, part of his Mentmore Towers project, and to build a swimming pool and squash courts underneath the forecourt of the house. However, the building remained vacant after 1999, and it fell into a state of disrepair. Plaster was falling off the ceiling in the first floor rooms, and many floorboards had been pulled up. In 2009, Halabi's companies went into bankruptcy. In June 2010, Cambridge House and its adjoining buildings, 90‚Äì93 Piccadilly (and 42 Half Moon Street), 95 Piccadilly (the former American Club) and 12 White Horse Street (the rear section being vacant land), as well as 96‚Äì100 Piccadilly (on the other side of White Horse Street), were all offered for sale through property brokers Jones Lang Lasalle, collectively referred to as the Piccadilly Estate, for in excess of ¬£150m. In June 2011, the site was acquired by David and Simon Reuben for a reported ¬£130m through their investment company, Aldersgate. In October 2012, applications were submitted for a full refurbishment into private homes (Numbers 94 and 95) and residential apartments (Numbers 90‚Äì93 and 42). In April 2013, David and Simon Reuben received approval to develop the property into a 60,600 square foot single home. It would likely have become the UK's most expensive home, estimated to be worth about ¬£250 million after renovation.http://www.primeresi.com/londons-first-250m-home-a-history-of-the- in-out/17969/ According to Bloomberg News, \\"the planning application for Number 94 was approved after the two investors offered to contribute ¬£3.85 million to the construction of affordable housing in the borough.\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-16/reubens-win-approval-for- mansion-near-london-s-ritz-hotel.html However, that development plan subsequently changed, and a new plan was conceived to convert the property into the \\"Cambridge House Hotel and Residences\\", with a five-star hotel and seven serviced residences.Reuben brothers‚Äô 94 Piccadilly hotel plans given the go-ahead Work on the project is being carried out by PDP London.PDP LondonCambridge House Hotel and Residences  References  *Pearce, David (1986).

It consists of four quarters: Hoornwijk and Ypenburg on the southwest of the A12 motorway and parallel railway to Utrecht, and Forepark and Leidschenveen on the northeast. Since 2005 the district has its own railway station, Den Haag Ypenburg, situated on the Gouda‚ÄìDen Haag railway. Two highway nodes are located in the district: Knooppunt Ypenburg and the Prins Clausplein.  History  Until 1992 Ypenburg was a military airfield known as Ypenburg Airport. It was the site of the Battle for The Hague on 10 May 1940, at the beginning of World War II. German forces attempted to capture the airfield via an airborne landing. This failed however and Dutch forces recaptured the airfield. After the Netherlands eventually surrendered to Germany, the Luftwaffe made no use of the airfield during the remainder of the war. Very little remains of the airport today, the former air traffic control tower being a notable exception. After the war the field remained a civilian airport until 1955, when it was turned into an Air Base. After 1968, operations decreased significantly; the Air Base was used mainly as a VIP airport for politicians and the royal family. In 1982 it was decided to close the Air Base, but it was not until 1992 that it was abandoned by the Royal Netherlands Air Force. In 1997 the new residential area was constructed on the site of the airport. Initially, Leidschenveen belonged to the municipality Leidschendam, whereas Ypenburg fell under Nootdorp and Rijswijk.

K√∂rber. It provides a platform to discuss present political topics and develops operational projects on social and political issues. Its agenda is focused on key areas of European foreign policy in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe, Russia and the CIS. The foundation pursues this agenda with four discussion fora: Bergedorf Round Table, K√∂rber Dialogue Middle East, Political Breakfasts, and K√∂rber Network Foreign Policy. The organization has its headquarters in Hamburg and maintains an international relations department in Berlin. Since the death of the company founder in 1992, it is the sole shareholder of K√∂rber AG.  Bergedorf Round Table  Chaired by former German president Richard von Weizs√§cker, the Bergedorf Round Table is a confidential, two-day gathering with around thirty participants that is held three times a year. Since 1961 it has promoted international dialogue between the realms of politics, science, business and society, focussing on the dialogue between policy-makers, diplomats and experts in international relations. More than 2,000 politicians and experts ‚Äì among them Pope John Paul II, Vladimir Putin, Helmut Kohl and Helmut Schmidt ‚Äì have participated at one or more of 139 Bergedorf Round Tables. Except for short statements to kick off the discussion, participants do not report prepared speeches, but intervene spontaneously. The discussions take place at venues where the topic under discussion is immediate and tangible. Participants come from Germany, other member states of the EU, from the US and from the region which is concerned. Following the conference a summary is sent to the participants and foreign policy-makers. Every Bergedorf Round Table is published as a protocol in German and English. To ensure confidentiality, the participants edit their contributions before publication.  K√∂rber Dialogue Middle East  Three times a year, the K√∂rber Dialogue Middle East provides a platform for multilateral discussions on topical issues of foreign and security policy in the Middle East. Around ten foreign policy experts from the EU, the US and the Middle East hold discussions and formulate policy recommendations. The inclusion of Iranian representatives into these discussions is given particular importance. The conference venue is either Istanbul or Berlin.  Political Breakfasts  Political Breakfasts in Berlin are high-level and confidential background discussions which seek to help cultivate foreign policy discourse in the German capital. The speakers include presidents, foreign ministers and other high-level political officials from abroad. They have the opportunity to discuss issues with a small group of senior foreign policy decision makers from the Bundestag, the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Chancellery, the Ministry of Defence, other agencies and selected think tanks.  K√∂rber Network Foreign Policy  Since 2005, the K√∂rber Network Foreign Policy has assembled a group of young foreign policy professionals from the German Bundestag, the Federal Chancellery, the Federal Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and selected foreign embassies in Berlin. The Network's members, who are invited on the basis of personal recommendations, explore challenges facing European foreign policy. Once a month, they speak in confidential discussions with foreign politicians and advisors over dinner at the K√∂rber Foundation's Berlin Office. Once a year, the group takes a field trip to gain personal experience with focal points of international politics. Participants meet senior representatives of governments and international organizations, as well as people active on the ground ‚Äì in peace-keeping missions, military structures, and major economic projects. Field trips were organised to Kosovo and Belgrade in 2005, to Georgia (including Abkhazia) in 2006 and to Iran in 2007.  Criticism  Connections between K√∂rber Foundation and politics have been described as too close by some media. A history contest, organized by the foundation, has been under the patronage of the President of Germany. Government politicians have been members of advisory councils for foundation awards and similar activities. According to critics, such connections violate guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the relations between governments and tobacco industry. However, affected politicians have pointed out the foundation's reputation and the social value of its projects.http://www.swr.de/report/presse/-/id=1197424/nid=1197424/did=5286398/1f0tbjl/ http://www.swr.de/report/-/id=233454/nid=233454/did=5137856/1j2xv3e/ References External links  * Category:International conferences in Germany Category:Non-profit organisations based in Hamburg Category:Political organisations based in Germany Category:Organizations established in 1959 ","title":"K√∂rber Foundation"},{"id":"3943715","text":"Graf Zeppelin in the background.

In 1966, Waddell joined Granada Television working with Michael Parkinson on local news programmes. In 1968, he moved to Yorkshire Television. Between 1968 and 1974, Waddell was a producer for over 600 editions of local news programme, Calendar. He also devised the ITV network children's series The Flaxton Boys a historical adventure series that ran for three years from 1969. 1972 was a big year for darts as ITV broadcast the News of the World Darts Championship for the first time. Waddell was an observer at Alexandra Palace during the 1972 News of the World Championship and was particularly impressed with the play and character of the eventual finalist, Welshman Alan Evans, who beat reigning champion Dennis Filkins in the semi finals with a fiery display. Also in 1972, Waddell created the show The Indoor League, which featured various pub games including darts, pool, bar billiards, bar skittles, Table football (aka foosball), arm wrestling and shove ha'penny. The Indoor League was only shown on Yorkshire Television in 1972 but went national on the ITV network from 1973 to 1977, although Waddell had left ITV by the last series of the programme. =BBC= In 1976, Waddell switched to the BBC and his experience with televised darts helped him to become one of the commentators on the first World Professional Darts Championship when it began in 1978. Waddell stayed with the BBC until 1994, commentating on all darts events covered by the BBC from 1978 to 1994, with his last darts commentary on the BBC being the first four sets of the 1994 BDO World Championship Final between John Part and Bobby George. During his time with the BBC, Waddell penned ten episodes of a successful children's television series, Jossy's Giants in 1986. He was also the writer of two series of another children's show Sloggers which ran from 1994 to 1996. His credits also include working with the eccentric scientist Magnus Pyke and he was Alan Whicker's producer on Whicker's Women in 1972. He worked on the Russell Harty Show, and in 1993 did a series for Tyne Tees Television called Waddell's World in which he was a butler to a posh Tweeddale family, a caravanner and on the dole. He made one performance as the \\"Voice of the Balls\\" on the National Lottery Red Alert on BBC in 1999. He said he was sacked for being \\"too Geordie\\". =Sky Sports= From 1994, Waddell became an independently employed commentator, but mainly associated with his work with Sky Sports. The first darts tournament he commentated on for Sky Sports was the 1994 World Matchplay at the Winter Gardens, Blackpool, in August 1994. For the next 17 years, he worked continuously as a commentator on all darts tournaments televised by Sky Sports. In September 2011, Waddell was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Despite this diagnosis and undergoing treatment, he managed to come back to the darts commentary box in the spring of 2012 during some Premier League nights. After commentating on a sporadic basis during the 2012 Premier League, Waddell did not commentate at either the 2012 UK Open nor the 2012 World Matchplay prior to his death on 11 August 2012. Waddell's last darts commentary came in the 2012 Premier League final between Phil Taylor and Simon Whitlock on 17 May, where Phil Taylor won the match 10-7 to take the 2012 Premier League title, although Waddell only commentated on the first part of the match; his last commentary contributing to a full match came in the same evening in the semi final match between Phil Taylor and James Wade, Taylor won the match 8‚Äì6. The World championship trophy has been renamed eponymously in his honour, in recognition of his contribution to darts. Waddell's last interview came in June 2012, where he discussed his life, darts commentary, pool commentary and his bowel cancer. This interview was aired on Sky Sports on 16 August 2012, five days after his death, as a tribute entitled: Sid Waddell ‚Äì A Life in His Own Words. =Pool commentary and other works= Besides darts, Waddell commentated on numerous other sporting events produced by Sky Sports and/or Matchroom Sport over the years. He regularly commentated on the four annual nine-ball pool events on which the two companies collaborated (World Pool Championship; World Pool Masters; World Pool League; and Mosconi Cup), particularly between the years of 1999‚Äì2003. However, as these events began to be hosted further away from the UK, Waddell gradually withdrew from the sport. He is remembered for coining the term \\"Golden Break\\", meaning when the 9-ball is pocketed directly from the break, giving the breaking player an immediate win. In 2004, he was the commentator for the British game show House of Games in which two families competed in various household based challenges.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420411/IMDb page In 2006, he began to host Sid Waddell's Wrestling Show on ESPN Classic. This show featured edited versions of matches from the days of World of Sport Wrestling. In 2007, Waddell and Eric Bristow recorded a series of Bellies and Bullseyes darts programmes about the World Darts Championship from 1978 until 1990 for ESPN Classic, which were later broadcast on the channel in December 2007. =Awards= Waddell was twice nominated for TV awards. He was up for BAFTA best director in 1992 for a documentary in the Ipso Facto series, and in 1994 he was nominated for best scriptwriter in the Writers' Guild of Great Britain awards for his children's cricket series Sloggers. Publications He wrote eleven published books, including biographies of John Lowe, Jocky Wilson and Phil Taylor. His book Bellies and Bullseyes was short listed for the British Sports Book Award for 2008. His racy 1973 novel Bedroll Bella about a Geordie groupie, was banned by WH Smiths and John Menzies. In 2009 he published a memoir of his boyhood in a Geordie pit village The Road Back Home. Personal life Waddell was married to Irene. Waddell was a fervent Newcastle United supporter, and lived in Pudsey. In September 2011, it was announced that Waddell had been diagnosed with bowel cancer. He succumbed to bowel cancer on 11 August 2012, the day after his 72nd birthday, In Harrogate, North Yorkshire. Following his death, the decision was made to rename the PDC World Darts Championship trophy the Sid Waddell trophy from 2013.World Darts Trophy Named After Waddell. Sky News (13 August 2012). Waddell's funeral was held in Leeds on 22 August 2012. Before Waddell's funeral he was cremated earlier in the day in a private ceremony.

Interim management can be seen as the short-term assignment of a proven heavyweight interim executive manager to manage a period of transition, crisis or change within an organization. In this situation, a permanent role may be unnecessary or impossible to find on short notice. Additionally, there may be nobody internally who is suitable for, or available to take up, the position in question. History Historical antecedents come from ancient Roman times, with ancient Roman publicans (Latin: publicanus, plural: publicani) or ‚ÄòRoman contractors‚Äô being engaged to erect or maintain public buildings, supply armies overseas, or collect certain taxes (such as tithes and customs). This system for letting contracts was well established by the 3rd century BC.Britannica Online Encyclopedia, 'Publican' 19/11/2009 The modern practice of interim management started in the mid to late-1970s, when permanent employees in The Netherlands were protected by long notice periods and companies faced large costs for terminating employees. Hiring temporary managers seemed like an ideal solution. Since the 1980s, the concept and use of interim managers as a resourcing tool for organisations has received attention from academic researchers and policy makers as well as practitioners. In 1984, Atkinson postulated the emergence of an organisation design comprising both a core and a peripheral workforce, using differing forms of contractual relationship (flexibility) on an international basis.Atkinson J. (1984): Manpower Strategies for Flexible Organisations: Personnel Management, 16(8): 28-31. Examples of further study include Kalleberg (2000),Kalleberg A. (2000): Nonstandard Employment Relations: Part- time, Temporary & Contract Work: Annu. Rev. Sociol., 26: 341-365 looking at temporary, contract and part-time work; and Bosch (2004)Bosch G. (2004): Towards a new Standard Employment Relationship in Western Europe: British J. of Ind. Relations, 42(4): 617-636 looking at Western European ‚Äúemployment‚Äù relationships. A good example of interim management benefitting from a geo- political change was its use by the German privatization agency after reunification of East and West, post 1989. The demand was created for interim managers in Eastern Germany to apply the required management and leadership competencies necessary to re-structure the formerly state owned companies. Demand continued to grow in the 1990s in Germany as the economy struggled to deal with unification, recession and resultant ambitious economic forecasts for the ‚Äònew‚Äô economy. One prominent example, mentioned by Bruns (2006)Bruns, J: Interim Management in an Innovation Context, pub. by Rainer Hampp Verlag, 2006 was the appointment of Helmut Sihler as interim CEO of German Telekom AG in 2001. The interim management value proposition There are several factors that make the interim management offering increasingly popular and cost-effective to client organisations. These factors are characterised as a ‚Äòvalue proposition‚Äô that interim managers offer to their clients. Although there is some variation at the margins of interim management (with temporary workers, freelancers, contractors and consultants) the following factors are typical of the interim management value proposition:.Institute of Interim Management, Introduction to Interim Management (2009). 19/11/2009 # Interim managers can be in place within days as opposed to weeks or months, which is essential when time constraints are paramount. Being practiced in engaging promptly with the situation, they become effective quickly upon joining a client organisation. Because of their experience and expertise, interim managers also conduct and complete assignments effectively and with due speed. # Interim managers typically operate at a senior level in the client organisation, often being sensibly over-qualified for the roles they take on. They often bring skills and knowledge not otherwise in place, to address a specific skills gap or problem. Their experience and expertise enables them to be productive and make a noticeable impact from the outset, maximising the likelihood of success. # Unencumbered by company politics or culture, interim managers provide a fresh perspective and are able to concentrate on what's best for the business. Being independent operators, they are able to contribute honestly without constituting a threat to the incumbent management team. Not being part of a larger business they are not pressured to unnecessarily extend their assignment. # Rather than taking on a purely advisory role, interim managers are managers responsible managing a particular business or project. They are accountable for results. # Operating at or near board-level gives interim managers the authority and credibility to effect significant change or transition within a company. Unlike a ‚Äòtemp‚Äô, they're not just there to ‚Äòhold the fort‚Äô. They actively add value to the client organisation as a result of their expertise and approach, even when the work and the decisions to be made are difficult. # Interim managers add value by using their skills and expertise to help deliver an outcome, solution, service or mitigate risk that provides a meaningful ‚Äòreturn on investment‚Äô to a client. Interim managers are paid on the understanding of goals and objectives being performed and delivered, and not simply on the basis of attendance. # Interim managers maintain high professional standards because their future work relies upon referrals and a successful track record. They therefore have a stake in the success of the assignments that they undertake. This contrasts favourably with other ‚Äòtemporary workers‚Äô who may also be seeking ‚Äòpermanent employment‚Äô or simply motivated by a day rate or extending their tenure. # Interim managers are available to work on a fractional or part-time basis. Especially in smaller organizations their skills may only be required for one or two days per week. The Fractional Executive saves companies money as they only pay for what they need. The interim management assignment lifecycle Interim assignments vary in scope and requirements, encompassing change management, ‚Äògap‚Äô assignments, project management and turnaround management. The following stages of the ‚Äòassignment lifecycle‚Äô are typical of how interim managers enter into an assignment, reach and carry out the actual implementation, and finally exit the assignment. The assignment should include a plan for making resources available to meet the longer-term goals. The early stages have much in common with consultancy, as do later stages with project management, but the accountability and responsibility that interim managers have for successful analysis and delivery of a fitting solution, is what makes these stages uniquely typical of the interim management approach.Lovegrove, Harley; (2007), The Pragmatic Approach Of An Interim Manager: Making A Difference pp. 23-24, Institute of Interim Management, Introduction to Interim Management (2010). 1/3/2010 # Entry. The prospective client and Interim make initial contact and explore the requirement sufficiently for the client to be able to decide to engage the interim manager (or not) to address the situation. This is likely to involve a ‚Äòpreliminary‚Äô assessment of what the client thinks they want and the scope of the interim manager's contribution. It is also likely to involve a due diligence and interview process to make sure the interim manager is the right fit for the business.Interim Management http://www.practicus.com/en-gb/client-services/interim-management.aspx Typically the entry stage takes place over one or more initial meetings and results in the interim manager's provisional engagement. # Diagnosis. The interim manager researches the current situation in order to understand it, how it came about, what are the requirements of the varying stakeholders. At this stage a more detailed understanding of ‚Äòwhat the situation is‚Äô is formed as well as approaches to address it. Differing issues or problems may come to light at this stage than initially highlighted by the client. On a ‚Äògap‚Äô assignment this diagnosis may run concurrently with the handling of immediate issues. Typically the diagnosis stage takes a few days. # Proposal. The interim manager presents a more detailed proposal that serves as an interim assignment objectives and plan. If this differs significantly from the preliminary plans determined at ‚Äòentry‚Äô, the solution may involve different requirements from the interim manager or possibly the ending of the assignment. It is common that this ‚Äòproposal‚Äô may challenge the client's understanding of the situation, on the basis of the interim manager's expertise. The interim manager takes the responsibility to propose a solution most likely to be effective, not automatically the one originally requested. In the case of a ‚Äògap assignment‚Äô such a proposal may simply outline how the interim manager is a ‚Äòsafe pair of hands‚Äô. # Implementation. The interim manager manages the intervention, project, or solution, tracking progress and conducts periodic feedback reviews with the client. During this stage, interim managers particularly exemplify their expertise, accountability and effectiveness. Depending on the assignment, they get as close to the situation as is necessary, whilst remaining an independent practitioner. They may manage teams and projects, deal with crises and changes, or simply ‚Äòholding the fort'. # Exit. The interim manager, approaching project end, ensures that objectives have been met, that the client is satisfied. This stage may involve ‚Äòknowledge handover and training‚Äô, determining and sourcing ‚Äòbusiness as usual‚Äô successors, and ‚Äòsharing lessons learnt‚Äô in the process. The interim manager is focused on the success of the assignment and not simply the length of his/her own tenure, which means that this stage can be carried our professionally and objectively. Often this is the end of the interim manager/client relationship. Sometimes interim managers may continue to give occasional 'ad hoc' consultancy. Sometimes the interim manager is re-engaged on a follow-on or further assignment, starting the ‚Äòlifecycle‚Äô again.Clutterbuck, David; Dearlove, Des; (1999), The Interim Manager, pp. 144,158-160 Uses of interim management There are a number of different business situations that could result in the need for an interim manager. Typically these could be situations such as crisis management, sudden departure, illness, death, change management, managing change or transition, start-up and scale-up businesses, sabbaticals, MBOs and IPOs, mergers and acquisitions, and project management. The functions of an interim manager are almost endless, thus the scope of an interim manager's skill set is quite unique. The interim management concept has taken root in the UK, Germany, and Belgium, and is spreading elsewhere, most notably in Australia, the US, France, and Ireland. In Spain recruitment increased by 68% in 2011, according to Michael Page Interim management, and since 2013 there is a first association called \\"Association Interim Management Spain\\". In Nigeria, the Institute Of Corporate and Interim Management has been approved by The Federal Ministry Of Education and established under Federal Government Decree No. 1 of 1990, to promote Corporate and Interim Management practice in Africa.

Life Born in Aberdare, Glamorgan, one of the six children of William Phillips, Phillips was brought up in Bargoed. He left school when he was 12 to become a colliery surface worker. When he was 18, Phillips became a member of the Caerphilly divisional Labour Party, and served as secretary of the party in Bargoed, 1923‚Äì25. He was chairman of the Bargoed Steam Coal Lodge, 1924‚Äì26. He was able to attend the Labour College, London for a two-year course in economic and social subjects. He remained in London and became secretary of the Labour Party in West Fulham, 1928‚Äì30. and later in Whitechapel, 1934-37. He became a councillor on Fulham borough council, 1934‚Äì37. In 1937 he was employed at the party's headquarters as propaganda officer, then as secretary of the party's research department from 1941. He soon rose to become secretary of the party in 1944, formally renamed general secretary in 1960. Phillips revolutionised the organisation of the Party and aimed to appeal to a wider set of people and professions, a professional basis for the election victories in 1945 and 1950, that saw fewer trade unionists and more professionals elected to Parliament. He called for recognition of middle class aspiration for wealth, home ownership and leisure opportunities, and warned against excessive emphasis on nationalisation. Nevertheless, Phillips and the party organization he led were blamed by some for the defeat in the 1955 general election: a post-mortem conducted by Harold Wilson labelled the party's organization as a \\"penny farthing [an antiquated model of bicycle] in a jet age\\". In 1957, Phillips joined Aneurin Bevan and Richard Crossman in suing The Spectator magazine for libel. An article had been published by The Spectator describing the men as drinking heavily during a socialist conference in Italy.\\"Messrs Bevan, Morgan Phillips and Richard Crossman...puzzled the Italians by their capacity to fill themselves like tanks with whisky and coffee... Although the Italians were never sure the British delegation were sober, they always attributed to them an immense political acumen.\\" See Bose, Mihir, \\"Britain's Libel Laws: Malice Aforethought\\", History Today, 5 May 2013. Having sworn that the charges were untrue, the three collected damages from the magazine. Many years later, Crossman's posthumously published diaries confirmed the truth of the magazine's charges.Roy Jenkins wrote of his former colleagues (in \\"Aneurin Bevan\\" in Portraits and Miniatures, 2011) that they \\"sailed to victory on the unfortunate combination of Lord Chief Justice Goddard's prejudice against the anti-hanging and generally libertarian Spectator of those days and the perjury of the plaintiffs, subsequently exposed in Crossman's endlessly revealing diaries.\\" Geoffrey Wheatcroft wrote (in The Guardian, 18 March 2000, \\"Lies and Libel\\"): \\"Fifteen years later, Crossman boasted (in my presence) that they had indeed all been toping heavily, and that at least one of them had been blind drunk.\\" Mihir Bose (in \\"Britain's Libel Laws: Malice Aforethought\\", History Today, 5 May 2013) quotes Bevan's biographer, John Campbell, to the effect that the case had destroyed the career of the young journalist involved, Jenny Nicholson. Phillips' reputation rose in the unsuccessful 1959 general election campaign. His daily press conferences were seen as an outstanding success, attracting much interest. He understood journalists and gave concise and insightful answers. He presented a clear analysis of what had happened during the election defeat and constructive proposals for the future, many of which are included in his paper, Labour in the Sixties (1960), that laid foundations for the return to power of the Labour Party in 1964. He also published East meets West (1954) and various political and economic pamphlets. Phillips was a key figure in the international Labour movement and presided over several conferences of the International Socialist Committee from 1944 onwards. He served as chairman of the Socialist International from its formation in 1948 until 1957. He suffered a stroke in August 1960, at the height of his career, and retired as General Secretary in 1961, dying in early 1963. Legacy The Labour History Archive and Study Centre at the People's History Museum in Manchester has the General Secretary papers of Morgan Phillips in their collection. Family In Fulham Labour Party Phillips met Norah Lusher, later Baroness Phillips, whom he married in 1930. They had a son and a daughter. The latter, Gwyneth Dunwoody, was a long-serving Labour MP from 1964 until her death in 2008; she married John Dunwoody, who would also become a Labour Member of Parliament. Their daughter, Tamsin Dunwoody was a Member of the National Assembly for Wales from 2003 to 2007.

Biography He was born on July 15, 1836 in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Winter graduated from Harvard Law School in 1857. William Winter wore many literary hats during his long, illustrious career: theater critic, biographer, poet, essayist, among them. He is known for his Romantic style poetry, and for his long career as an editor and writer for some of New York City's great papers. Winter was a tour de force in the original Bohemian scene of Greenwich Village, going on to become one of the most influential men of letters of the last half of the 19th century and the pre-eminent drama critic and biographer of the times. Winter became the unofficial biographer of the Pfaff's Circle of Greenwich Village of which he was a part. The Pfaffians spawned the careers of such writers as Walt Whitman and Mark Twain. By 1854 Winter had already published a collection of verse and worked as a reviewer for the Boston Transcript; he befriended Pfaffian Thomas Bailey Aldrich after reviewing a volume of his poetry. He relocated to New York in 1856. Winter became a regular at the center of Greenwich Village's Bohemian hotspot, Pfaff's, where artists, renegades, and radical thinkers of all kinds converged. This was where Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Winslow Homer, Edwin Booth, Adah Isaacs Menken, Ada Clara, Horatio Alger Jr and an endless list of the Bohemian crowd came to mix with the journalists and radical political thinkers of the times. It was where one came to explore a new counter-culture in the Village, a salon of the Civil War era where the unconventional literati would gather-a place where no topic was off limits and all eccentricities were embraced. Winter was at the heart of this influential circle known as The Pfaffians who gathered weekly at the Vault at Pfaff's Beer Hall on Broadway and Bleeker. The Pfaff Bohemians would lay the foundation for Winter's entire life and career as both a poet and a writer. He later described some of his life as a young Pfaffian, describing the extraordinary scene and the many great minds he encountered in his biography Old Friends (1909). He also wrote introductions and brief biographies for the editions of the collected works of Pfaff's regulars like Fitz James O'Brien, John Brougham, and George Arnold. \\"The vault at Pfaffs where the drinkers and laughers meet to eat and drink and carouse.\\" ‚ÄîWalt Whitman At Pfaff's, Winter quickly was embraced due to his great wit and writing talents, becoming the right-hand man to Henry Clapp Jr's circle of Pfaffian's. Clapp soon made him assistant editor and literary critic to one of the first truly Bohemian publications in America, the literary and social commentary weekly, The Saturday Press, in print from 1858-1866. Here is where Walt Whitman and Mark Twain published their earliest works, and was the main publication of the Pfaffian Circle. In 1860 Winter married Scottish poet and novelist Elizabeth Campbell, raising their five children in Staten Island, New York. Winter went on to a stellar writing and editorial career at some of New York City's most influential papers, working as a dramatic and literary critic for the Albion and Harper's Weekly, as well as Horace Greeley's Tribune for more than 40 years. His piercing wit and brilliant writing made him the leading stage historian and theater critic of the 19th century (W. Eaton, \\"William Winter\\"). In the 1880s he began publishing biographies of thespians like the Jefferson family and Edwin Booth. Winter opposed the modernist theater of playwrights like Ibsen, and maintained that drama should be a moral force. His 1912 The Wallet of Time offers a fascinating retrospective look at the development of nineteenth-century theater; in the preface, he states that \\"[a] ruling purpose of my criticism has been... to oppose, denounce, and endeavor to defeat the policy which, in unscrupulous greed of gain, allows the Theatre to become an instrument to vitiate public taste and corrupt public morals\\" (xxiv). Winter's work on New York's theatrical scene details the careers, pursuits, and tastes of the major players and plays. He encouraged actors and writers to acknowledge the \\"use of a power manifestly greater in modern society than it ever was before in the history of civilization... and, if possible, to exert a beneficial influence on the mind of the rising generation,  the generation that will support the Drama, determine its spirit, and shape its destiny\\" . He died in New Brighton, Staten Island on June 30, 1917 after a bout of angina pectoris. He was buried at Silver Mount Cemetery. Archives Winter left two significant archives of biographies and essays on stars like Edwin Booth and Sir Henry Irving, in addition to career papers documenting his work as a writer and critic. Part of his archive was purchased by theatre and film producer and collector Messmore Kendall, who donated his collection of William Winter's papers and books along with Harry Houdini's archive to the University of Texas at Austin, where it is now available for research at the Harry Ransom Center. His enormously prolific legacy is also preserved at the Folger Shakespeare Library's Robert Young Collection on William Winter. In 1886, in commemoration of the death of his son, he founded a library at the academy in Stapleton, New York.

It was an Australian development of the North American NA-16 training aircraft. The Wirraway has been credited as being the foundation of Australian aircraft manufacturing. During the Second World War, both the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) deployed a number of Wirraways into combat roles, where they served in a makeshift light bomber/ground attack capacity, striking against the advancing forces of the Empire of Japan. While the type had been primarily used as a trainer and general purpose aircraft, being present in small quantities within the majority of front-line squadrons for these purposes, the aircraft was often pressed into combat when required. Typically, fighter versions of the Wirraway were operated over theatres such as New Guinea to perform ground attack missions and other Army co-operation tasks over extended periods until more advanced aircraft had become available in sufficient quantities. On 12 December 1942, the Wirraway achieved its only shoot-down of an enemy aircraft‚Äîthought to be a Mitsubishi A6M Zero at the time, but later determined to be a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusahttps://acesflyinghigh.wordpress.com/2018/02/17/australian-war- memorial-cac-wirraway-the-unlikely-zero-killer/‚Äîwhile flown by Pilot Officer John S. \\"Jack\\" Archer. Following the end of the conflict, the Wirraway was operated for over a decade as a trainer by the RAAF, the newly formed RAN Fleet Air Arm, and the squadrons of the Citizen Air Force. During 1957, the last of the RAN's Wirraways was retired, having been replaced by the newer jet-powered de Havilland Vampire; as the CAC Winjeel came into squadron service, the RAAF phasing out its remaining fleet of Wirraways during the late 1950s. Officially, the last military flight to be performed by the type was conducted on 27 April 1959. Notably, the Wirraway had also functioned as the starting point for the design of a wartime \\"emergency fighter\\", which was also developed and manufactured by CAC, known as the Boomerang. Development=Background= During the mid 1930s, some political leaders observed that both the Empire of Japan and Nazi Germany had the appearance of having been making strides towards a heavy preparedness for war, which in turn led to several other countries commencing their own preparations in response. However, in the case of Australia, the nation had no domestic aircraft industry, partially due to a historical preference for the procurement of both civil and military-orientated aircraft to be sourced overseas from manufacturers based in the United Kingdom, which had come about through strong political and cultural ties between the two nations. Around the same time, the Australian government decided to embark upon the development and expansion of the RAAF into a fighting force capable of defending the nation against external aggressors, in line with recommendations made by a formal evaluation compiled by Sir John Salmond in 1928. Allegedly, the move in Australia had been heavily influenced by a British decision taken in May 1935 to massively increase the front-line strength of the Royal Air Force (RAF). However, it was recognised that, while Britain had traditionally been the main source of aircraft for Australia, comprising around 50 per cent of all operational aircraft at one point, British industry was already coming under strain to meet the demands for the RAF, let alone satisfying major orders from other nations. Coincidentally, figures such as the industrialist Essington Lewis had taken an interest in the development of a domestic aircraft industry within Australia. These factors cumulated in a special conference held by the Australian government at which the first plans for syndicate-operated factories to produce both aircraft and aero engines were formulated. Accordingly, during early 1936, three Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) officers, led by Wing Commander Lawrence Wackett, were sent on an overseas evaluation mission to inspect aircraft production in Europe, Britain, and the United States, as well as to support the selection of an aircraft design for local production in Australia. In light of the industrial circumstances, the production of cutting-edge high performance fighter aircraft, such as the Supermarine Spitfire, were viewed as being too ambitious and a potential jeopardy to the whole venture. The government's position focused on the establishment of an industrial base capable of producing aircraft; thus, it was determined that the first aircraft to be domestically manufactured should be a reliable and established general purpose aircraft, while a long-term goal of proceeding to locally produce high-performance fighters would take around five years to attain. The question of what specific aircraft should be manufactured was a more complex question, as it was quickly recognised that there was no existing aircraft in RAAF service that was attractive to pursue local production of. On 17 October 1936, with the encouragement of the Government of Australia, three companies came together to form a joint venture, registered as the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC), which had the initial goal of assessing the viability for developing a self-sufficient aircraft industry in the nation.Francillon 1967, p. 3. Early on, CAC set about planning for the establishment of both engine and aircraft manufacturing and testing facilities at Fishermans Bend, Melbourne, Victoria, purchasing tooling and equipment from manufacturers in both Britain and the United States. The newly formed company quickly decided that it would initially pursue the development and production of a single-engine armed advanced trainer aircraft, which would likely be a licence-built version of an existing aircraft. An investigation of various European and American-sourced aircraft was conducted to judge candidate designs for suitability. =Selection= The aircraft selected by CAC was the North American Aviation (NAA) NA-16, upon the recommendation of Lawrence Wackett. The selection was heavily fuelled by the relatively low level of difficulty involved in the manufacture of both the airframe and its Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp radial engine. The application for the NA-16 was often viewed as being suitable for the trainer aircraft role, but that it could also play some role as a fighter-bomber as well, although there were doubts voiced by senior figures over its combat suitability. The selection was not without controversy as some voices within the Australian government were keen for aircraft manufacturing and development to be kept within the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1938, an inspection by Sir Edward Ellington of the then in-development Wirraway in 1938 led to him to express his opinion that the type should only serve temporarily in combat roles, and that the choice should be delayed to await the testing of a suitable British aircraft for the mission. Nevertheless, the proposal of producing a modified variant of the NA-16, known as the Wirraway, received official approval. During 1937, CAC was informed to prepare for the production of an initial batch of 40 aircraft, if the type proved satisfactory. In late June 1938, the Australian government announced that it had placed an order for 40 Wirraways; it stated at the time that the price involved was competitive with comparative imported aircraft.{{harvnb{harvnbProfile number 1541967pp=4‚Äì5}} Ellington's report on the aircraft's suitability was hotly contested, especially by the Australian Air Board, which had been subject to considerable criticism by Ellington; the board defended the Wirraway as being the best available aircraft in its class. During 1937, production licences for the type were obtained from North American Aviation along with an accompanying arrangement to domestically produce the Wirraway's Wasp engine from Pratt & Whitney. Additionally, a pair of NA-16s were purchased directly from North American to act as prototypes. The first of these two aircraft was the fixed undercarriage NA-16-1A (similar in design to the BT-9); the second was the retractable undercarriage NA-16-2K (similar to the BC-1). These two aircraft were also known by their NAA project accounting codes (NA-32 for the NA-16-1A and NA-33 for the NA-16-2K) sometimes leading to confusion; these accounting codes (or \\"charge\\" codes) were used internally by NAA to track their projects and were not the actual aircraft model numbers.Smith 2000, p. 8. During August 1937, the NA-16-1A arrived in Australia and, following its re-assembly, flew for the first time at Laverton on 3 September of that year, exactly two years before war was declared on Nazi Germany by the United Kingdom and France. During September 1937, the NA-16-2K arrived in Australia and likewise flew shortly afterwards. These aircraft were given the RAAF serials A20-1 and A20-2 within that organisation's numbering system. =Production= Wirraway aircraft under construction at a CAC factory in 1940 The NA-16-2K model was the type selected for initial production. The design featured several detail and structural changes, such as provisions for the fitting of a pair of forward-firing guns instead of the NA-16's single gun, and the strengthening of the tail and wings to better facilitate dive-bombing operations. Other modifications included the adoption of a single gun set on a swivelling mount to the rear of the cockpit, along with the installation of cameras and radio sets. On 27 March 1939, the first CA-1 Wirraway, RAAF serial A20-3, performed its maiden flight. This aircraft was subsequently retained by CAC for evaluation and trials for a number of months; on 10 July 1939, the first pair of Wirraways to be delivered to the RAAF, serials A20-4 and A20-5, were received by the service. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the RAAF had received a total of six Wirraways. Early on, it became clear that CAC's rate of manufacture of the airframes outstripped Australian capacity to produce the Wasp engines to power the type. During 1940, having observed an excess of Australian capacity, Britain issued an offer to procure any Wirraway airframes that could be produced that had not already been allocated to fulfil RAAF orders, intending to fit US-built Wasp engines to power them. This led to the placing of an initial British order for 245 aircraft, the last of which was to be delivered before the end of 1942. During October 1940, this order was expanded to cover 500 aircraft, 300 of which being scheduled for delivery during 1943. While these orders were ultimately unmet due to the implementation of the extensive American-led Lend-Lease arrangement, the British government did finance the procurement of aircraft for Australian use within the Empire Air Training Scheme. Forty CA-1 Wirraways were constructed before the improved CA-3 variant entered production. Although there were detail changes to the design, the change in designation had more to do with the next batch of Wirraways being built to a different government contract than any real difference between the two sub-types. During February 1942, the Australian War Cabinet issued its approval for the production of 105 Wirraway interceptors as \\"reinsurance against [an] inability to obtain fighter aircraft from overseas\\". Around this time, the War Cabinet also decided to reject an order for 245 Wirraways that had been received from Britain.War Cabinet Minute, Melbourne 2 February 1942, (1845) Agendum No.46/1942 ‚Äì Aircraft Production Policy. In July 1940, at which point the United Kingdom was the sole European nation fighting against German in the war, the Australian Government issued a statement advising that \\"from this date onward Australia can rely on England for no further supplies of any aircraft materials or equipment of any kind. The CA-5, CA-7, CA-8 and CA-9 models were all broadly similar to the CA-3; only the CA-16 variant featured substantial design changes; amongst other purposes, several wing modifications had been made to allow for the carriage of a heavier bomb load, along with the addition of dive brakes for dive-bombing. Sets of 'dive bomber' wings (as fitted to the CA-16) were built under the designation of CA-10A (the CA-10 model was a proposed dive-bomber variant that remained unbuilt), and retrofitted to CA-3s, ‚àí5s, ‚àí7s and ‚àí9s; 113 Wirraways were converted. Seventeen Wirraways were modified post- war and delivered to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the modifications were incorporated under the CAC designation CA-20. These 17 aircraft included a CA-1, a CA-5 and numbers of all subsequent variants; they were operated under their original RAAF serials. Production of the type continued even after the end of the Second World War. In July 1946, CA-16 A20-757, the last aircraft to be built of a total of 755 Wirraways, was delivered to the RAAF. Design The CAC Wirraway was a training and general purpose military aircraft. The fuselage comprised a welded framework composed of chromium steel, which was construction from four separately produced sections bolted together during final assembly. The sides of the fuselage featured fabric covering supported by aluminium alloy frames, while the underside and decking has metal coverings instead. The single-spar wings, which were built in five individual sections, were composed of spaced ribs and a stressed skin. The control surfaces were metal-framed with fabric covering; the split-flap arrangement of early Wirraways were supplemented on later-built aircraft via the addition of dive brakes. An all-metal stressed skin construction was used for the tailplane and fin; both side of the tailplane were interchangeable. The Wirraway was powered by a single 600 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp radial engine, licence-built by CAC. the engine drove a three-bladed variable-pitch propeller developed by de Havilland Propellers. Fuel was stored within a pair of 45 gallon tanks. The two-man crew sat within a tandem cockpit, complete with a fully enclosed sliding canopy; both positions were fitted with flying controls. In addition, the rear cockpit featured a rotatable folding seat for the gunner/bomb-aimer, as well as a prone bombing position in the floor of the aircraft. The Wirraway could carry a light armament of a single 500 lb bomb or a pair of 250 lb bombs under the wings; light bombs or flares could also be carried underneath the centerline section. Additionally, a pair of forward-firing Vickers Mk.V machine guns were fitted along with a single swivel-mounted machine gun positioned at the rear of the cockpit. Operational history=Wartime service= In June 1939, in light of the declining situation in Europe and the increasing likelihood of a major conflict, the Chief of the Air staff recommended the expansion of the RAAF to a total of 32 squadrons; of these, preparations for 9 general purpose squadrons, which were intended to be equipped with the Wirraway, were immediately put into motion. On 25 August 1939, one month after the first deliveries of the Wirraway had occurred, an official State of Emergency was declared; on 3 September 1939, as the Second World War broke out in Europe, Australia decided to mobilise the entirety of its air force, placing all squadrons on short call for combat operations. However, during the first year of the war, the Wirraway was still being introduced in quantity within many squadrons; this effort was delayed by a temporary shortage of available spare parts. As its American \\"cousin\\" the T-6 (both types having been derived from the NA-16) did for many Allied Air Forces during the Second World War, the Wirraway served as one of the RAAF's main trainer types from 1939. Beside serving as a trainer aircraft they were also operated in combat roles, including as an emergency fighter. At the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941 Wirraways equipped seven RAAF squadrons: Nos 4, 5, 12, 22, 23, 24 and 25. A group of five Wirraways based at Kluang in Malaya for training purposes was pressed into combat against Japanese ground invasion forces; these were generally flown by New Zealanders with Australian observers, and had some successes. As early as 1941, reports on the capabilities of Japanese fighter aircraft fuelled the perception that the Wirraway would be incapable of effectively engaging such aircraft; however, the type was judged to possess some merits in combat despite being considered to be obsolete. Regardless, the type was often put into action against the advancing Japanese forces. On 6 January 1942, Wirraways of No. 24 Squadron attempted to intercept Japanese seaplanes flying over New Britain; only one managed to engage an enemy aircraft, marking the first air-to-air combat between RAAF and Japanese forces. Two weeks later, eight 24 Squadron Wirraways defended the city of Rabaul from over 100 Japanese attacking bombers and fighters, resulting in the destruction or severe damage of all but two of the Australian aircraft. On 12 December 1942, Pilot Officer J. S. Archer shot down a Japanese fighter aircraft (thought at the time to be an A6M Zero, but found after the war to be a Ki-43) after having spotted it around 1000 feet (about 300 metres) below him and dived on it, opening fire and sending the Zero hurtling into the sea. This was the only occasion that a Wirraway shot down another aircraft (and is one more than the total of aircraft shot down by its fighter offspring, the Boomerang). In response to a request by Sir Thomas Blamey for an army cooperation squadron operating a relatively slow aircraft, No. 4 Squadron, equipped with the Wirraway, was dispatched to Port Moresby during early November 1942. Operating over New Guinea, the type performed aerial reconnaissance, photography, artillery spotting, communication, supply drops, dive-bombing, ground attack and propaganda drops. In this capacity, the Wirraway proved to be fairly suitable; however, due to the risk of being misidentified as a hostile Zero, altitude restrictions were often imposed to deter incidents of friendly fire from Allied anti-aircraft gunners. Having become known for its versatility, fighter versions of the Wirraway operated over New Guinea for some time on ground attack and other Army co-operation tasks until other RAAF aircraft such as the Boomerang and American Curtiss P-40s were made available in sufficient quantity to replace them. By mid-1943, nearly all frontline use of the Wirraway had come to an end, having been replaced by the newer Boomerang, itself a fighter-orientated derivative of the Wirraway. The majority of front-line squadrons of the RAAF had at least one Wirraway attached to serve as a squadron 'hack', that is, an aircraft employed on errands such as visits to headquarters or other bases. At least one aircraft (formerly A20-527) flew as part of Headquarters Flight 5th Air Force in full United States Army Air Forces markings. =Post-war and civil service= Post-war the Wirraway continued in RAAF service as a trainer at Uranquinty and Point Cook and was taken on strength by the newly formed RAN Fleet Air Arm in 1948. Wirraways also served with the squadrons of the Citizen Air Force (a flying reserve force of the RAAF established in 1948) alongside CAC Mustangs, partially equipping No. 22 (City of Sydney), No. 23 (City of Brisbane), No. 24 (City of Adelaide) and No. 25 (City of Perth) Squadrons. Duties were not limited to training flights: a Wirraway patrolling for sharks crashed on a beach at Maroochydore on 30 December 1950, killing three children and injuring 14 other people. The RAN retired its Wirraways in 1957, replacing them with de Havilland Vampires. After CAC Winjeels started to enter service, the RAAF commenced phasing out its Wirraways on 4 December 1958 with a farewell flypast held at Point Cook to mark its retirement from that base. The last military flight was on 27 April 1959 when CA-16 A20-686 was flown to Tocumwal for disposal. A surviving CA-16 Wirraway operating as a warbird In 1954, Super Spread Aviation, based at Moorabbin Airport, bought two CA-16 Wirraways and modified them to perform aerial application operations. Both were almost brand-new, one having flown 9 hours and the other 12 hours; the modifications included the fitment of a hopper and spraying equipment. In a reflection of much of what was asked of the type during wartime, the two aircraft proved to be inadequate for the task and both were de-registered on 10 April 1956 and later scrapped.Rolland, Derrick. \\"Aerial Agriculture in Australia: a history of the use of aircraft in agriculture and forestry\\". Aerial Agricultural Association of Australia Ltd. 1996. Despite the scrapping of these two aircraft and hundreds of others, a healthy number of Wirraways survive today, in aviation museums in Australia, Papua New Guinea and in the United States; and with 10 on the Australian civil aircraft registerAustralian civil aircraft register searches, conducted using \\"CA-3\\", \\"CA-5\\", \\"CA-7\\", \\"CA-8\\", \\"CA-9\\" and \\"CA-16\\" as search parameters.

It is a mass-produced product that is often produced using a hot extraction method, and juice concentrate is typically produced using a low- temperature extraction method. It is used by some as a dietary supplement to act as a laxative and to alleviate constipation. It is also sometimes used as a flavor enhancer in tobacco products.

It is considered to be a high-fiber food. = Phytochemicals = Prune juice and plums contain phytochemicals, including phenolic compounds (mainly as neochlorogenic acids and chlorogenic acids) and sorbitol.  Production  Prune juice is often produced using hot extraction methods, whereby the prunes are cooked in hot water, becoming a liquid extract, which is then processed into juice. The process of heating and extraction may occur several times with the same batch of prunes, with the collective extracts from each processing then mixed together to create the final product. Prune juice is a mass-produced product. Prune juice is also produced as a concentrate, whereby low temperature water is used to create a liquid extract. The concentrate has a high sugar content, and is used by food processors to enhance the flavor of and sweeten products, as a humectant to retain moisture in cookies and cakes, and as an ingredient in cereal bars to bind the ingredients.  As a dietary supplement  Prunes may provide a natural laxative effect, and prune juice may serve as a natural laxative for cases of mild constipation. In 1990, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated that \\"the common prune was not an effective laxative\\".  History = United States = Duffy-Mott began producing prune juice in 1933, which was purveyed under the Sunsweet brand name. The commercial distribution of prune juice in the United States first occurred in 1934, which \\"began with an output of only 40,000 cases\\".  Other uses  Prune juice concentrate, prune extracts and plum extracts are sometimes used as an additive in tobacco products to enhance flavor.  Toilet water  In central Pennsylvania during the early days of prohibition in the United States, some bootleggers sold a dangerous concoction facetiously referred to as whiskey, which was also called \\"toilet water\\", that consisted of colognes, perfumes and prune juice mixed together.

The most interesting property of the F.V was that it could be configured either as a biplane or a monoplane, as the lower wing could be removed. It was not a success and only one was built. Design and development There are no surviving records of the early thinking of Anthony Fokker that lead to this unusual aircraft, designed by Reinhold Platz. The idea was that the biplane configuration would be able to lift greater loads because of the greater wing area, whereas the monoplane version would suffer lower drag and be faster. The upper wing was a typical Fokker thick, internally braced design, with ailerons projecting beyond the wingtips, all in the style of the earlier F.III and F.IV aircraft. However, with the F.V it was mounted as a parasol wing, connected to the fuselage by four struts on each side. The biplane conversion was designed to be simple, with the lower wing connected to the upper by simple N type struts, uncomplicated by bracing wires. Plywood fuselage cover on the F.V Fokker's earlier machines had fabric covered tube steel fuselages, but in the F.V the fabric was replaced by an inner and an outer layer of plywood (both triple-ply) to increase stiffness. The fuselage was flat and deep sided, contributing to yaw stability and in its earliest form no vertical stabiliser was provided, only a rudder. Later the rudder was revised and a fin added. The engine was a 268 kW (360 hp) Rolls- Royce Eagle water cooled in-line. This drove what was effectively a four- bladed propeller, though it was made by mounting two two-bladed propellers at right angles one behind the other on the single drive shaft. The increased number of blades meant that the diameter, thus tip velocity and noise was less than with a larger two-blade propeller. The design reflected the realisation that airliners were going to fly further and longer: it had dual controls, toilet and wash facilities and cabin heating. The later was provided by running the engine exhaust pipes horizontally along the aircraft sides above all the cabin windows, where vents allowed the warm air heated by the outside of the exhaust to flow inboard. Seating for eight passengers was provided. The first flight took place on 7 December 1922 from Schiphol. One characteristic emerged immediately: the plywood panelling of the fuselage made the aircraft vibrate and the cabin extremely noisy. During trials the F.V reportedly flew mostly as a biplane. The sole F.V left the Dutch aircraft register in May 1926, marked \\"Sold to Austria\\". SpecificationsReferences *R. de Leeuw (ed.) Fokker Commercial Aircraft (1994).

It stars Rutger Hauer as presenter and John Woolvett as the fictional Dr. John Templeton. Other members of the cast include actress Sharon Lloyd as a fake volunteer and magician Paul Andrews as Head of Experiments. In this show, four volunteers are challenged to stay for 48 hours in a disused mental asylum and endure a series of mental challenges designed to test their courage. Such challenges include facing violence, snakes, electricity, the dark, drowning, disgust, heights, spiders, pain, and inflicting pain on others. A cast of actors and stuntmen are used to increase the realism of the challenges, while psychological tricks and illusions aim to convince the volunteers that they are really facing their worst fears. They can forfeit a challenge at any time by pressing a buzzer which they hold with them. When not performing a challenge, the volunteers are escorted to their cells by unknown masked men who never talk, to create an environment of stress and panic. The volunteers also have to stay the night in their cells in complete darkness, while screams and shouts further unsettle the volunteers. The volunteers are also allowed to leave the asylum at any time should they be unable to continue, but those that stay to the end are rewarded with the knowledge that they have faced their greatest fears.

It is also a brand that has been used by the BBC to mean: *The large BBC North region, centred on Manchester, that was active from the late 1920s until 1968 and was based upon one of the four UK regional radio transmission stations. *The BBC North region, centred on Leeds, that was active between 1968 and 2004 and which was split to form BBC Yorkshire and BBC Yorks & Lincs. *The operational department called BBC North that combined the output of the BBC's northern regions between 1990 and 1996. *The BBC North Group of major BBC departments that have already moved or are moving from London to MediaCityUK in Greater Manchester from 2011 onwards. As part of the BBC North Project. BBC region 1920s‚Äì1968 Dickenson Road Studios, Manchester The first BBC North operation was a large region, based in Manchester and covering the areas now served by BBC North West, BBC North East and Cumbria, BBC Yorkshire and BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Regional radio broadcasting was largely based at a leased studio complex above a bank known as 'Old Broadcasting House' at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester city centre. These studios became the base for radio output from the region in 1929. The BBC's first regional television studio, studio A, would be based elsewhere in the city - at a converted church on Dickenson Road in Rusholme, which opened in 1954 after being owned and operated by Mancunian Films.History of the Mancunian Film Studios It's a hot'un Regional television news bulletins began from Piccadilly's studio N in 30 September 1957 and served the entire North of England. Two years later, the northern half of the region (the North East and Cumbria) began receiving its own TV news bulletins from Newcastle (BBC North East and Cumbria) while the two distinct areas either side of the Pennines continued to receive what eventually became Look North from Manchester until 22 March 1968. Regional radio output for this area continued on an opt-out of BBC Radio 4 until September 1980 (by which time, six BBC Local Radio stations had been set up to cover the North West & Yorkshire regions). BBC region 1968‚Äì2004=Programmes= Based at the Broadcasting Centre at Woodhouse Lane in Leeds, BBC North was the production centre for regional television output, including the nightly news programme Look North and BBC Local Radio station BBC Radio Leeds. =History= Old Broadcasting House, Leeds. The Leeds island site went on air on 25 March 1968 as a response to the imminent opening of Yorkshire Television, the new ITV contractor based in Leeds serving the area east of the Pennines, formerly part of the Granada Television area. And in a similar manner to the impending ITV east-west Granada-Yorkshire split, the BBC divided the old North Region (based in Manchester) into BBC North West (Manchester) and the new BBC North (Leeds). This enabled a separate edition of Look North to be produced, initially from All Souls in Blackman Lane - a church hall near Woodhouse Lane - using equipment from a redundant OB scanner plus \\"mobile\\" telecine and film processing vans (the latter obtained from BBC TV News in London). Until this time, BBC viewers here had only the Manchester edition of the regional opt-out to watch, just as on ITV, where Granada had been the only choice of regional news magazine programme for the entire Lancashire & Yorkshire viewing area. The launch of Yorkshire Television four months later would mark the launch of ITV's own regional news programme for the new region, Calendar. Leeds was to have the third incarnation of the BBC programme called Look North; the others continued to be produced in Newcastle, another island site, and in Manchester, which was also the BBC Network Production Centre (NPC) for the north of England. In 1974\\"A Geographical List of Television Studios\\", Royal Television Society, p12 the programme moved into a new colour studio equipped with EMI 2001 cameras in the newly built Broadcasting Centre adjacent to Broadcasting House, in Woodhouse Lane, where it remained for thirty years until the studio was demolished in 2004.Corporation shall speak destruction unto demolition contractor asperceived.com During 2001 an opt-out service was introduced for viewers in East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, consisting of a news summary within the main 6:30pm edition of Look North and a full length late bulletin on weeknights. The 6:30pm opt-out was extended into a full length 30 minute programme in November 2002. In June 2004, the BBC North region was fully split to form the BBC Yorkshire and North Midlands region and the BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire region. BBC Yorkshire and North Midlands is based in St. Peter's Square, Leeds, and is transmitted from Emley Moor and its associated relays, as well as by satellite from SES Astra 1N at 28.2 East on 10.803 GHz, SID 6441, Freesat EPG 966 to a population of around 4 million. BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire is based in Queen's Court in Hull and is transmitted from Belmont and its associated relays, as well as by satellite from SES Astra 1N at 28.2 East on 10,788 GHz V, SID 10303, Freesat EPG 967 to around 1.7 million. Operation 1990‚Äì1996 Between 1990 and 1996, the three northern regions of BBC North West, BBC North East and BBC North merged their administration and managerial departments as a cost-saving measure. The new service was centred on New Broadcasting House in Manchester. The new service produced all of the regional programming, and all the regions used BBC North on-screen branding, but still retained the unique identity of the regional news programmes. The operation also became head of the Network Production Centre at Manchester, making BBC North one of the biggest producers of network television outside London. The regions were separated in 1996 in a drive to serve the regions better, which could not be done from Manchester alone. BBC North Group (2004‚Äìpresent) BBC North Group is one of eight major operational divisions of the BBC the others being BBC Television, BBC Radio, BBC News Group, BBC Executive Board, BBC Management Board, BBC Digital and BBC Finance & Business and comprises a number of BBC departments (25 in all), that are located and operating at the 200 acre (80ha) development MediaCityUK built by the Peel Group, as part of the \\"BBC North Project\\", also called \\"Out of London\\". This group is directly answerable to the Director General's Office and the BBC Trust. The group contains BBC Sport, along with CBBC, CBeebies, BBC Learning, BBC Breakfast, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Philharmonic, BBC Research & Development, BBC Digital, BBC R & D (North Lab), BBC Radio 4 (programme production), BBC Radio 6 Music (programme production), BBC Radio Manchester, BBC Manchester network production centre and BBC North West. The project began in 2006 when Salford was named as the chosen location by the Board of Governors and in 2007 the go-ahead was given to the project by the BBC Trust. The previous BBC Director General Mark Thompson indicated that either BBC One, BBC Two or BBC Three could also move by 2015.

It is a non-profit foundation functioning both as a public museum and a specialized research center. The archives of the museum contain around 70,000 documents related to science fiction or utopia (books, art pieces, toys, etc.), including some very old (as early as the sixteenth century) or unique pieces. The collections of the museum are used for iconographic purposes or research (literature, history of ideas, design, etc.). The Maison d'Ailleurs thus represents an important research and documentation center. In parallel, the museum presents from two to three temporary exhibitions per year, around the main themes of science fiction (cities of the future, space travel, lost worlds, etc.) and its artists: H. R. Giger, John Howe, James Gurney, Caza, Jean Fontaine, etc.. The exhibitions favour diversity and openness towards the world, in order to reach a broad audience. The museum also offers itinerary exhibitions and regularly presents its work in Switzerland and abroad. Half a dozen exhibitions are rented per year on average. The Maison d'Ailleurs is the only public institution of its kind in the world. It has the status of a non-profit foundation, and therefore isn't directly a communal museum. The Foundation manages the collections owned by the city of Yverdon-les-Bains in the building it has been provided with. Five to seven members of the Foundation board are chosen by the municipality of Yverdon-les-Bains, while two others come from the association Amis de la Maison d'Ailleurs (Friends of the House of Elsewhere). History The Maison d'Ailleurs originates from the work of the French encyclopedian Pierre Versins, who dedicated his life to writing and the study of what he named \\"rational romanesque conjectures\\" (\\"conjectures romanesques rationnelles\\" in French). For more than twenty years, he gathered a very important collection of science fiction works. Based on this corpus, he wrote one of the major books in this domain, the Encyclop√©die de l'utopie, des voyages extraordinaires et de la science-fiction. In 1976, he donated his assets to the city of Yverdon-les-Bains and the Maison d'Ailleurs was created. Pierre Versins acts as its curator until he moves back to France in 1981. Initially, the Maison d'Ailleurs only occupies a three-room flat, and doesn't have the ambition of a museum. After a lethargy period (during which the direction is held by Pascal Ducommun), the municipality of Yverdon-les-Bains decides in 1989 to install the Maison d'Ailleurs in the renovated old prison, a historical building built in 1806 and well-situated in the center of the city. The journalist Roger Gaillard (1947‚Äì2010) is chosen as its curator and the new museum opens in 1991. By the end of 1995, the communal council of Yverdon decided to cut more than 70% of the budget for the next year, which dramatically reduced the organizational slack of the Maison d'Ailleurs and generated a lot of negative reactions. The majority of the staff was dismissed. In 1998, a foundation is created to manage the museum. Its first decision is to give the direction to historian Patrick Gyger, who takes over in February 1999. Espace Jules Verne The Jules Verne Exhibition Space In 2003, collector Jean-Michel Margot decided to donate one of the most important collections dedicated to Jules Verne to the city of Yverdon-les-Bains. The Maison d'Ailleurs was given the task to manage and present this collection. This Jules Verne collection contains about 20,000 documents, including rare pieces such as posters dating from the end of the nineteenth century, hand- written notes, ancient iconography linked to discovery and scientific adventure, as well as the complete collection of the Voyages Extraordinaires, owned by the granddaughter of Pierre-Jules Hetzel, Jules Verne's publisher. To host these pieces, a new Espace Jules Verne (Jules Verne Exhibition Space) has been built in the old casino of Yverdon-les-Bains. In addition to the public presentation of the collection, a workspace is reserved to researchers, with a privileged access to documents. The Espace Jules Verne is connected to the rest of the museum by a footbridge. The administration of the museum and a large collection of pulp magazines have also been moved to the new building. This will allow the creation of a permanent exhibition at the Maison d'Ailleurs, in addition to the temporary exhibitions. The Espace Jules Verne opened in October 2008. Partnerships The Maison d'Ailleurs represents an ever-expanding research and documentation center, which has built a large network of partners over time. The museum collaborates with the European Space Agency (ESA), the University of Lausanne, the Cit√© de l'Espace in Toulouse (France), the International Trade Event in Bordeaux, the \\"Utopiales\\" festival in Nantes (France), the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival, and it is part of the Science et Cit√© network in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Among its studies, the Maison d'Ailleurs has coordinated an important research funded by the ESA to try to find, in science fiction works, imaginary inventions related to astronautics and space conquest technologies. In a partnership with the ESA and the Agence Martienne (Martian Agency), the Maison d'Ailleurs has realised the most important science fiction image library in the world. The museum has also been mandated by Pro Helvetia to prepare an important itinerary exhibition project about Swiss artists working in cinema and video games.

Clark led the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) from 1999 until it was effectively disbanded in 2004.  Personal  Clark was raised by his grandmother, Alice, in an Aboriginal community in western Victoria. He was a keen boxer, boxing in Jimmy Sharman's tent when it came to Warrnambool. At age 20 Clark moved to Western Australia and until he was 26 he worked as a builder's labourer and as a gardener; he also played Australian rules football for West Australian Football League (WAFL) clubs Claremont and Subiaco. Geoff also represented Norwood Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) for three games in 1978.  Political career  In 1979 Clark became the administrator for the Framlingham Aboriginal Community Trust. He co-founded the Aboriginal Provisional Government in 1983. Between 1983 and 1996, he was active locally and internationally in indigenous affairs. In December 1996 Clark was elected to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) board as the Native Title spokesman. In December 1999 he became the first chairperson of ATSIC to be elected to that position. Clark served two terms in this position before the organisation was disbanded in 2004. Clark's tenure was increasingly overshadowed by allegations of misconduct and ongoing criminal proceedings against him. In August 2003, Clark was suspended as ATSIC chairperson by the Indigenous Affairs Minister, Amanda Vanstone. The suspension was later overruled in court. In 2004, the Howard Government abolished ATSIC.  Court proceedings  In 2000 Clark was charged with the 1981 rape of his cousin, Joanne McGuinness, but a magistrate found there was insufficient evidence to bring the case to trial. In 2001, press reports in The Age claimed that Clark was responsible for four rapes that took place in the 1970s and 1980s. McGuiness and Carol Stingel launched separate civil cases against Clark in 2002. Both alleged that he raped four women including McGuiness and Stingel. In 2003 further criminal charges of rape were filed by the Victoria Police but the charges were dismissed due to discrepancies in the evidence. In 2003 it emerged that ATSIC had agreed to allocate $45,000 to fund Clark's legal defence relating to a pub brawl where he was present. Nineteen charges were initially filed, with all but 'riotous behaviour' and 'obstructing police' eventually dropped. Clark was convicted on both in his first trial, with the riotous behaviour charge later dismissed on appeal. In January 2007 a County Court of Victoria civil jury found that he had led two pack rapes in 1971. The victim, Carol Anne Stingel, suffered from post traumatic stress syndrome, was awarded $20,000 in compensatory damages and around $71,000 to cover legal costs. No exemplary damages were awarded, although this is not unusual in Australian civil law. In response to the question of whether it was \\"the lowest point in his life\\", Clark described the ruling as \\"the lowest point in the history of this country\\". In February 2007 Clark appealed the findings of the jury in the Stingel matter. His notice of appeal alleged the verdict to be 'perverse', that the trial judge misdirected the jury regarding failures to call corroborative witnesses on the part of the complainant, that the trial judge erred in ruling against the admission of certain evidence, and that the fairness of the trial process had been compromised by pre-trial publicity. In December 2007 he lost his appeal against the damages awarded against him. Clark never paid the $20,000 compensation to Stingel and owes more than $300,000 to her lawyers.\\"Clark in funds at property auction\\" by Stuart Rintoul, The Australian, 22‚Äì23 June 2013 Although Clark declared bankruptcy in 2009 which was extended by five years in June 2012, he made an unsuccessful $1.25 million bid in June 2013 for a hotel in Warrnambool. In September 2011, Clark was one of the successful complainants in a racial discrimination case involving Herald Sun journalist Andrew Bolt, who in a 2009 article claimed that Clark had used his 'part Aboriginal ethnicity' (not consistent with Australian definition of Aboriginality) to gain social benefits. Clark said he took part in the action because of the general \\"tone\\" of Bolt's writing.

By the end of February, the newly activated squadron arrived in San Pedro de Macor√≠s, Santo Domingo for duty with the 2nd Brigade where it served until July 1924. During its deployment to Santo Domingo, the squadron was designated Marine Observation Squadron One (VO-1M) on 1 July 1922. Vought VE-7F from VO-1M in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic c. 1922. From Santo Domingo the squadron traveled to San Diego, California and became the first Marine squadron on the West Coast and was designated as the aviation asset to accompany Marine Expeditionary Forces. During the West Coast interlude, the late Major General Ross E. Rowell, then a Major and Commanding Officer concentrated on training in dive-bombing tactics. Such tactics were to prove invaluable to the squadron in Nicaragua, during July 1927, where the squadron had been ordered the previous February. Shortly after its redesignation on July 1, 1927 to VO-8M, the squadron participated in the Battle of Ocotal on 16 July when ten personnel of the squadron came to the rescue of the beleaguered Marine garrison at Ocotal and executed the first recorded dive bombing attack against an organized enemy, dispersing the insurgents and saving the garrison. Among the first Marine aviators ever to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross were Major Rowell and Lieutenant Hayne Boyden, to whom it was awarded for their participation in the Battle of Ocotal. Vought SU-2 Corsairs from VO-8M c. 1934. SB2U-3 of VMS-2 at MCAS Ewa, in 1941. Returning to San Diego in 1928, the squadron traded in its World War I-era O2B-1s for new Curtiss F8C-1s and F8C-3s, which were soon redesignated OC-1s and OC-2s. Shortly after receiving the F8C/OCs, the squadron, along with VO-10M took part in the filming of the 1929 movie Flight. As Marine aviation reorganized and consolidated in the early 1930s, several long established squadrons ceased to exist, and on July 1, 1933, VO-8M was deactivated. Unlike the fate that befell her sister squadrons, VO-8M was reactivated on November 15, 1934 when it was decided to deactivate VS-14M and VS-15M and use the aircraft and personnel from these two carrier squadrons to reorganize VO-8M. Equipped with Vought O3U-6 \\"Corsairs\\" the squadron continued to operate from San Diego and participated in the annual Fleet Problems, operating from the aircraft carriers , , and at different times, and participated in the filming of the 1935 movie Devil Dogs of the Air. In 1936, the squadron was selected to represent Marine aviation at the National Air Races was still flying the O3U-6 when it was redesignated Marine Scouting Squadron Two (VMS-2) on 1 July 1937. Later that year, the squadron traded in its \\"Corsairs\\" for Curtiss SOC-3 Seagulls a type it would operate for the next four years. With the rest of Marine Air Group Two, the squadron deployed to Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Hawaii in January 1941, and was the second squadron to receive the new Vought SB2U-3 Vindicator eventually receiving 27 of the type in 1941. Along with the new aircraft came a new designation, and on July 1, 1941, the squadron was redesignated Marine Scout-Bombing Squadron 231 (VMSB-231). With the prospect of war growing, the squadron, under the command of Major C.J. Chappell, embarked upon the aircraft carrier during the first week of December 1941 and was on its way to Midway Atoll when word of the attack on Pearl Harbor reached the carrier. =World War II= Although the squadron was aboard the Lexington during the attack on Pearl Harbor, the rear echelon, still at MCAS Ewa suffered the loss of seven spare SB2U-3s which had been left behind. The squadron returned to MCAS Ewa on December 10, 1941,{{sfnSherrod1952pp= but one week later it was headed back to Midway, but not aboard a carrier. Fitted with an extra fuel tank and accompanied by a PBY Catalina flying boat acting as a plane guard, the squadron conducted the longest overwater flight by single-engine aircraft on record at that time and arrived at Midway without the loss of a single aircraft or crew. The squadron flew routine patrols and awaited the expected Japanese attack. On March 1, 1942, while still at Midway, the squadron was split in two when VMSB-241 was created and the two squadrons operated side by side, even flying the same aircraft. Shortly thereafter, VMSB-231 was officially transferred back to Ewa, but a majority of its personnel and all of its aircraft remained at Midway.

Glidden Reorganizing at MCAS Ewa, the squadron received Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and was transferred to Marine Aircraft Group 23 (MAG-23). Slowly receiving new SBD-3 Dauntlesses and pilots, the squadron was notified in July 1942 that it would be deployed for duty overseas. Along with VMF-224, the squadron constituted the rear echelon of MAG-23 and was loaded aboard the aircraft transport during the last week of August 1942 and shipped to the South Pacific. Arriving at Efate, the squadron spent the night there and the squadron's aircraft were craned over to the escort aircraft carrier . The next day, the SBDs were catapulted from the 'Long Island and flown to Espiritu Santo. After another night's layover, the flight echelon flew to Henderson Field on Guadalcanal on August 30, 1942, arriving right before the daily Japanese air raid on the field and becoming the second Marine dive bomber squadron to operate ashore Major Leo Smith, and Captains Ruben Iden and Elmer Glidden led the squadron during the stay on Guadalcanal. Captain Iden died in combat on September 20, 1942, a day after he assumed command. While on Guadalcanal, eleven of the squadron's twelve original SBDs were lost or rendered inoperable between August 30 and October 3, 1942. During this time Lieutenant Glen Loeffel was awarded the Navy Cross for heroism for his lone attack on the Japanese heavy cruiser Furutaka on October 4, 1942, causing substantial damage and leading to her eventual sinking on October 11, 1942. VMF-231 operated on Guadalcanal as part of the Cactus Air Force from August 30 until November 2, 1942. It then was shipped back to Naval Air Station San Diego, California, arriving there on November 19, 1942, and then moved further north to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California, in January 1943. The squadron again deployed to the Pacific Theater and began operations bombing by-passed Japanese garrisons in the Marshall Islands on February 4, 1944. In October 1944, it was redesignated VMBF-231 and converted to the F4U Corsair fighter. Two months later, on December 30, 1944, it reverted to the name VMSB-231 and remained in the Marshalls until the surrender of Japan in August 1945. During the course of World War II the squadron was credited with downing seven Japanese aircraft in air-to-air combat.Sherrod (1952), pp. 430, 464. =Post-war years= Following World War II, the squadron served as an element of the United States Marine Corps Reserve as VMF-231 in Akron, Ohio, and Grosse Ile Township, Michigan, until it was deactivated on August 31, 1962. =1970s & 1980s= A Marine VMA-231 AV-8A with a camouflage paint during pre- flight operations. Harrier has two napalm bombs on its right wing. VMA-231 was reactivated on May 15, 1973, and the Marine Corps' oldest squadron became the Corps' newest, flying the Corps' newest aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley AV-8A Harrier. The AV-8A was a high performance, high speed jet aircraft that was uniquely capable of vertical and short take off and landing (VSTOL). October 4, 1976 saw VMA-231 deploying to the Mediterranean aboard with Carrier Air Wing 19. VMA-231's journey included visits to Spain, Italy, Sicily, Kenya, and Egypt. Highlights of the cruise included a transit of the Suez Canal aboard and participation of VMA-231 in Kenya's Independence Day celebration by twelve AV-8A aircraft. VMA-231 rejoined the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing on April 20, 1977, as the squadron safely returned to MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina. Also in 1977, VMA-231 was named V/STOL Squadron of the Year, becoming the first recipient of this award. During =The Gulf War & the 1990s= June 1990 found VMA-231 deployed to Western Pacific as a squadron for the first time since World War II. Training continued in Iwakuni and Okinawa, Japan, as well as the Philippine Islands and Korea. Notably, the squadron weathered the July earthquake in Northern Luzon. Their deployment was extended when they received orders directing them to Southeast Asia for Operation Desert Shield. The move necessitated an unprecedented around-the-world trip as the Ace of Spades flew 18,000 NM in 14 days to join MAG-13 (forward). During the trip the squadron accrued 904 flight hours in December, a record for fleet Harrier squadrons. On the morning of January 17, 1991, Operation Desert Storm began and VMA-231 was flying combat missions to silence Iraqi artillery batteries, which were indiscriminately shelling the Saudi Arabian border town of Khafji. On February 9, 1991, a newly promoted captain, pilot Russell A.C. Sanborn‚Äôs aircraft was shot down over the Iraqi-occupied Kuwaiti desert by a surface-to-air missile during a combat mission. With the uncontrollable jet hurtling inverted toward the sand, he ejected safely but was quickly captured by Iraqi troops. For 26 days, he was held in a small, dank, and unsanitary cell and tortured viciously by his captors until his release on March 6, 1991 when he was repatriated with fifteen other Americans. During February 1991, when the air war intensified and the critical ground campaign began, Marine Attack Squadron 231 accumulated 966.2 hours. This monthly total is a United States Marine Corps Harrier record. The \\"Ace of Spades\\" flew a total of 987 combat sorties and 1,195.8 hours during the conflict. In total, 1,660 Mk-82s, 62 Mk-83s, 969 Mk-20 Rockeyes, 78 Mk-77 fire bombs, and 22,709 rounds of 25-millimeter munitions were expended. A grand total of 1,692,000 pounds of ammunition was delivered against enemy positions and equipment. In September 1991, a six-plane detachment was sent out with HMH-362 aboard the amphibious assault ship where it served as part of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit in the Persian Gulf. During November 1992, the squadron embarked on a two-site deployment by taking part of the squadron and fourteen jets to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, and leaving six jets at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina, to support the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard the Saipan. From February 1995 to August 1996, VMA-231 would participate with the 24th MEU aboard the amphibious assault ship in rescuing downed United States Air Force pilot Captain Scott O'Grady and also with the 26th MEU aboard the amphibious assault ship participating in Operation Deny Flight. In April 1999, the Ace of Spades deployed with the 26th MEU on board the Kearsarge. They were involved in many operations, such as Operation Allied Force, bombing targets in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They also participated in Operation Joint Guardian, Operation Shining Hope, and Operation Avid Response. =The Global War on Terror= AV-8B Harrier II from VMA-231 landing in 2003 In April 2003 a detachment from the squadron took part in the invasion of Iraq as part of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. In the spring of 2007 they deployed to Al Asad Airbase again in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this time they flew 1738 combat sorties totaling over 5158 flight hours.VMA-231 Squadron History In November 2009 the squadron deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). They were part of Marine Aircraft Group 14 and were based out of Kandahar International Airport flying close air support missions in support of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade (2nd MEB).VMA-231 Remains in the Sky After 90 Years They returned home in early summer 2010. = Future Plans = VMA-231 plans to start transitioning to F-35Bs in 2026.

It allows the user to specify tasks and describe dependencies as well as to group tasks in a namespace. It is similar to SCons and Make, but it has a number of differences. The tool is written in the Ruby programming language and the Rakefiles (equivalent of Makefiles in Make) use Ruby syntax. It was created by Jim Weirich. Rake uses Ruby's anonymous function blocks to define various tasks, allowing the use of Ruby syntax. It has a library of common tasks: for example, functions to do common file-manipulation tasks and a library to remove compiled files (the \\"clean\\" task). Like Make, Rake can also synthesize tasks based on patterns: for example, automatically building a file compilation task based on filename patterns. Rake is now part of the standard library from Ruby version 1.9 onward. Example Below is an example of a simple Rake script to build a C Hello World program. file 'hello.o' => 'hello.c' do sh 'cc -c -o hello.o hello.c' end file 'hello' => 'hello.o' do sh 'cc -o hello hello.o' end For further examples, see the Rakefile format documentation. =Rules= When a file is named as a prerequisite but it does not have a file task defined for it, Rake will attempt to synthesize a task by looking at a list of rules supplied in the Rakefile. For example, suppose we were trying to invoke task \\"mycode.o\\" with no tasks defined for it. If the Rakefile has a rule that looks like this: rule '.o' => '.c' do t sh \\"cc #{t.source} -c -o #{t.name}\\" end This rule will synthesize any task that ends in \\".o\\". It has as a prerequisite that a source file with an extension of \\".c\\" must exist. If Rake is able to find a file named \\"mycode.c\\", it will automatically create a task that builds \\"mycode.o\\" from \\"mycode.c\\". If the file \\"mycode.c\\" does not exist, Rake will attempt to recursively synthesize a rule for it. When a task is synthesized from a rule, the source attribute of the task is set to the matching source file. This allows users to write rules with actions that reference the source file. =Advanced rules= Any regular expression may be used as the rule pattern. Additionally, a proc may be used to calculate the name of the source file. This allows for complex patterns and sources. The following rule is equivalent to the example above: rule(/\\\\\\\\.o$/ => ->(t_name){ t_name.sub /\\\\\\\\.o$/, '.c' }) do t sh \\"cc #{t.source} -c -o #{t.name}\\" end NOTE: Because of a quirk in Ruby syntax, parentheses are required around a rule when the first argument is a regular expression. The following rule might be used for Java files: rule '.class' => ->(t_name){ t_name .sub(/\\\\\\\\.class$/, '.java') .sub(/^classes\\\\//, 'src/') } do t java_compile(t.source, t.name) end Below is an example of a simple Rake recipe: namespace :cake do desc 'make pancakes' task :pancake => [:flour,:milk,:egg,:baking_powder] do puts \\"sizzle\\" end task :butter do puts \\"cut 3 tablespoons of butter into tiny squares\\" end task :flour => :butter do puts \\"use hands to knead butter squares into 1 cup flour\\" end task :milk do puts \\"add 1 cup milk\\" end task :egg do puts \\"add 1 egg\\" end task :baking_powder do puts \\"add 3 teaspoons baking powder\\" end end See also * Make * Apache Maven * Apache Ant  External links  * Rake documentation  Using the Rake build language by Martin Fowler * Ruby on Rails Rake tutorial at railsenvy.com * Custom Rake Tasks at railscasts.com * Rake Tutorial at lukaszwrobel.pl Category:Computer programming tools Category:Build automation Category:Software using the MIT license Category:Ruby (programming language) ","title":"Rake (software)"},{"id":"3943878","text":"The tuftedcheeks are passerine birds in the genus Pseudocolaptes of the ovenbird family.

The most common forms of high motion are NTSC and PAL video (i.e., \\"normal television\\") at their native display rates. Movie film (at the standard 24 frame/s) does not portray high motion even when shown on television monitors.  History  In the early 20th century when 35mm movie film was developed, producers found that 18‚Äì24 frames per second was adequate for portraying motion in a movie theater environment. Flicker was still a problem at these rates, but projectors solved this by projecting each frame twice, thus creating a refresh rate of 36‚Äì48 Hz without using excessive amounts of film. However, when television was developed, there was no corresponding way to capture a video frame and project it twice. The solution to this was interlace, which had a side effect that 50 to 60 images per second were presented to the viewer. Television producers found that these higher image rates made certain shots possible that were unacceptable on film. Camera pans and text scrolls could be faster. Handheld camera work seemed less objectionable, and most importantly, sports action was much clearer ‚Äî particularly when following a ball was critical.  Definition of high motion  There are no commonly used imaging systems that run at rates higher than 30 frame/s but lower than 48 Hz, so 48 Hz or higher is the de facto standard for high motion. The effects of high motion can be reduced or negated by converter lag when NTSC video is converted to PAL, or vice versa (a particular problem for coverage of international sporting events such as the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup, for example); however, more recent motion adaptive converters can minimize this. Showscan's research indicates that an average of 66.7 frames per second is the upper limit of what the human eye can perceive, and higher frame rates have no further effect, except in reducing flicker. (See refresh rate.)  High motion and the \\"video look\\"  Until the late 1990s, programs shot on video always possessed high motion, while programming shot on film never did. (The exceptions: Certain motion simulators and amusement park rides included film projected at 48‚Äì60 frames per second, and video recorded on kinescope film recorders lost its high motion characteristic.) This had the result of high motion being associated with news coverage and low-budget programming such as soap operas and some sitcoms. Higher-budget programming on television was usually shot on film. In the 1950s, when Hollywood experimented with higher frame rates for films (such as with the Todd AO process) some objected to the more video-like look (although the inability to convert such films for projection in regular theaters was a more serious problem). High motion is often criticized as interfering with the suspension of disbelief, and making it difficult to forget that the viewer is watching actors performing a scene. Some feel that this is an inherent advantage to lower frame rates, while others suggest that it is due to the historical availability of high motion only in programs that are least able to use the medium artistically, and the evolution of acting techniques based on lack of high motion. In areas where high-motion drama is more common, such as Britain, viewers tend to tolerate the look better.  Effects of new technology  In the mid and late 2000s, digital video technology had started to make it possible to shoot video at the \\"film look\\" rate of 24 frame/s at little or no additional cost. This had resulted in less high motion on television and on the internet on Video sharing applications such as YouTube in the early to mid 2010s. The future presence of digital projectors in theaters opens up the possibility that Hollywood movies could someday include high motion‚Äîperhaps in action films intercut with 24 frame/s for non-action scenes. The MaxiVision48 3-perf film format promotes this use with its ability to switch from 24 frame/s to 48 frame/s on the fly during projection. However, 3-perf has not seen much adaptation as a projection format. Director Peter Jackson's three-part Hobbit film series was shot at 48 fps, using the Red Digital Cinema Epic video camera system. Many action cameras of the 2010s take video at High-Motion frame rates. GoPro, Sony and other action camera competitors record video at 1080p and 2.7k at 120 fps, 720p and 1080p at 240 fps, and 4k at 60 fps. Although the video formats were designed for slowing down in post-production, the cameras generally record very high frame rates in high definition with generally clear audio. Alongside action cameras, gaming monitors often display very high refresh rates as high as 240 Hz as of 2017, while generally the standard is 144 Hz. This means gaming displays can display videos shot at high motion and play them back at their proper frame rates in real time at up to 240 fps, achieving basically an authentic high motion look. The human eye can perceive anywhere from 480 fps to 4000 fps , and see it as looking completely realistic or immersive naturally. While 120 fps looks 'realistic', the stroboscopic look can still be seen, which also happens on 60 Hz monitors playing 60 fps video and sometimes excessive motion blur, depending on the camera and shutter speed that was used when the video was recorded. Otherwise, videos over 200 fps are more preferred, since they look more fluid and realistic naturally or by simply changing the shutter speed with an ND filter at frame rates between 50 fps and 120 fps.. YouTube in October 2014 started to allow for the beginning of High-Motion content or High Frame Rate content, as well as videos before 2014 uploaded at over 30 fps, up to 60 fps.  Alternate use of the term  In the context of digital video compression, \\"high motion\\" is sometimes used to describe footage in which frames change too rapidly for motion prediction techniques to be effective. This article describes only the high frame rate definition.

The Advanced Light Source (ALS) is above in the background. The JGI and KBase completed their move to the IGB in December 2019.alt= The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute (JGI), first located in Walnut Creek then Berkeley, California, was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). As a DOE Office of Science User Facility of Berkeley Lab, the JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The JGI also collaborates with other DOE-supported programs and facilities, such as the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, or NERSC, and the DOE Bioenergy Research Centers. History In 1999, the University of California, which manages the three national labs for the DOE, leased laboratory and office space in a light industrial park in Walnut Creek, California to consolidate genome research activities. Led by biotechnology industry veteran Nigel Mouncey, who assumed the position of Director in March 2017, the DOE JGI receives its funding from the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in DOE's Office of Science. Originally established to work on the Human Genome Project‚Äîthe JGI generated the complete sequences of Chromosomes 5, 16 and 19‚Äîthe JGI has since shifted its focus to the non-human components of the biosphere, particularly those relevant to the DOE's science mission. Since 2004, the JGI has been a user facility that advances genomics research in a broad range of disciplines where DNA sequence information is likely to drive scientific discoveries. In February 2004, the JGI launched the Community Sequencing Program (CSP), known as the Community Science Program, which provides the scientific community at large with access to high-throughput, high-quality sequencing, DNA synthesis, metabolomics and analysis capabilities. The projects involve many important multicellular organisms, microbes and communities of microbes called metagenomes (or microbiomes) related to the DOE mission areas of bioenergy, understanding global cycles such as the carbon cycle, and biogeochemistry and are chosen primarily based on scientific merit as determined by outside review. In 2019, the JGI had 1,933 active primary users worldwide and over 10,000 data users (those who login and download data sets or use the online tools). Genome sequencing milestones Plant genomes and fungal genomes that can inform the development of sustainable biofuels and bioproducts, and microorganisms such as those that thrive under extreme conditions such as high acidity, radiation and metal contamination are of particular interest to the DOE. Investigations by the JGI and its users are shedding light on plant biomass breakdown mechanisms and the cellular machinery of microbes and how they can be harnessed to clean up contaminated soil or water, capture carbon from the atmosphere and produce potentially important sources of energy such as hydrogen and methane. In 2006, the JGI published the genome of the first tree sequenced‚Äîthe cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). In partnership with other federal institutions and universities, the JGI has also published the genome sequences of sorghum; the microbial community in the termite hindgut, which could provide enzymes useful to biofuel production; microbes such as the bacteria Desulfovibrio that clean up sites contaminated with radioactive or toxic compounds; and algae involved in the global carbon cycle. In 2009, the JGI reached a sequencing capacity milestone, generated more than a trillion bases (Tb) generated annually. In 2011, the JGI generated nearly 30 Terabases of sequence and in 2019, the JGI generated more than 326 Tb of sequence. The JGI makes the high-quality data from genome sequencing, DNA synthesis, and metabolomics freely available to the greater scientific community on its website and on other public databases. Data management systems The JGI also supports programs dedicated to functional and evolutionary genomics related to the organisms and environments being sequenced and the development of computational and bioinformatic tools for data management and mining. These genome and metagenome/microbiome analysis systems include Genome Portal, Phytozome, IMG and the Genomes OnLine Database. The Integrated Microbial Genomes System (IMG), which provides a framework for comparative analysis of primarily microbial genomes, though the system also supports eukaryotic genomes and environmental samples. Its goal is to facilitate the visualization and exploration of genomes from a functional and evolutionary perspective.

The island forms part of the Khortytsia National Park. This historic site is located within the city limits of Zaporizhia, Ukraine. The island has played an important role in the history of Ukraine, specially in the history of the Zaporozhian Cossacks. The island has unique flora and fauna, including oak groves, spruce woods, meadows, and steppe. The northern part of the island is very rocky and high (rising above the river bed) in comparison to the southern part, which is low, and often flooded by the waters of the Dnieper. Geography and location A Neolithic altar reconstructed at Khortytsia View from space Zaporizhia (direct translation is \\"beyond the rapids\\") takes its name from a geographic area downstream of the Dnieper river pass the ninth rapid (see Dnieper Rapids). In the 1930s when the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station was built, these rapids were flooded. Only granite cliffs, rising to the height of , testify to the original rocky terrain of the region. History Khortytsia has been continuously inhabited during the last five millennia. Other islands in the immediate vicinity also contain indications of intensive occupation during the Proto-Indo-European and Scythian periods. The island of Small Khortytsia is known for its Scythian remains and a derelict Cossack fortress. The islet of Sredeny Stih (to the northeast of Khortytsia), excavated during construction of the hydroelectric station in 1927, gave its name to the Sredny Stog culture. In the Early Middle Ages, Khortytsia was a key centre for the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. In his treatise De Administrando Imperio, Emperor Constantine VII mentions the island of St. George immediately downstream from the rapids. He reports that, while passing through the rapids, the Rus would be easy prey for the nomadic Pechenegs. Indeed, the Kiev Rus' prince Svyatoslav I was attacked and killed during his attempt to cross the rapids in 972. View of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station from Khortytsia The earliest record about a stronghold known as a sich refers to the one was located on the island of Small Khortytsia (Mala Khortytsia Island) and was established by the Volhynian prince Dmytro Vyshnevetsky. The Small Khortytsia Island is 20 times smaller than Khortytsia itself. The first Khortytsia Sich existed six years (1552‚Äì1558). There are few others locations downstream past the rapids (Zaporizhia area) where the Zaporizhian Sich was located. There are eight of them: Bazavluk (1593‚Äì1630), Mykytyn (1628‚Äì1652), Chortomlyk (1652‚Äì1709), Kamin (1709‚Äì1711), Oleshkiv (1711‚Äì1734), Pidpilna (1734‚Äì1775). All these places were at river crossings. The uprising led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky was started at the Mykytyn Sich in 1648. Legends state, that cossacks wrote the notorious Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of the Ottoman Empire on Khortytsia. In the 1775, the Sich was destroyed by the Russian general Tekhely on the order of Catherine the Great. The Zaporozhian Cossacks as a result were displaced, many eventually settling on the Kuban river in the Caucasus area. These Cossacks became known as Kuban cossacks. A part of the Zaporozhian Cossacks escaped to beyond the Danube to become vassals of the Ottoman Sultan. They dwelt at mouth of the Danube river. In 1830 many of these Cossacks moved and established a new Sich on the Azov sea shore (between Mariupol and Berdiansk). The last Kosh Otaman (leader) of Zaporizhian Sich Petro Kalnyshevsky was imprisoned at Solovetsky Island Monastery. At that time he was 85 years old. After 25 years in prison he was released and died almost blind at the monastery at age of 113 years. In 1789, Danzig Mennonites from Prussia were invited by the czar to form settlements on the vast steppes of the Russian Empire. One of these settlements was located on the island of Khortytsia. They farmed on the rich island soil. Some of their profitable business was trade in lumber from the Khortytsia groves and woods. In 1916 the Mennonite colonists sold Khortytsia Island to the Olexandrivsk (Alexandrovsk) city council (see Chortitza Colony). In 1965 Khortytsia Island was \\"proclaimed a historical and cultural reserve\\". The Dnieper Rapids state historical and cultural reserve was established in 1974; this included both Khortytsia Island, adjacent islands and rocks and part of the right bank of the Dnieper. The total area of the reserve is . The reserve was given national status in 1993. National Reserve Museum of Zaporizhian Cossacks The major part of the reserve (historic park) covers the Zaporizhian Cossack Museum that includes the Cossack horse show. The museum building is modern, nestling low in the landscape with dramatic views of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station to the north. The museum was built on October 14, 1983 as the Museum of Zaporizhia History although its project was approved by the Ministry of Culture and Derzhbud of Ukraine in December 1970. The expo area of the museum was accounted for portraying the following themes: Khortytsia in ancient times, history of Zaporizhian Cossacks, history of Zaporizhia at times of construction of socialism. There also existed four dioramas: \\"Battle of Sviatoslav at rapids\\" (author - M.Oviechkin), \\"Uprising of the impoverished cossacks at Zaporizhian Sich in 1768\\" (M.Oviechkin), \\"Construction of Dnieper HES\\" (V.Trotsenko), \\"Night storm of Zaporizhia city in October 1943\\" (M.Oviechkin). Part of the museum became also the Zaporizhian Oak located at the Upper Khortytsia. In 1992 the exposition of the museum was redesigned. The museum contains exhibits dating from the Stone Age through the Scythian period (c.750 - 250 BC) down to the 20th century. Other objects On Khortytsia at Savutyn summit close to the same name the ravine is a 74.5m tall three electrical transmission towers, called Zaporizhzhia Pylon Triple, which is a part of a 150 kV powerline crossing Dnieper river.

History The regional operation from Leeds began in 1968, when the original BBC North region was broken up into BBC North, BBC North West and BBC North East, with the BBC North name being transferred from Manchester to the new operation in Leeds. The new operation was called BBC North until 2002. Old Broadcasting House on Woodhouse Lane BBC Yorkshire Studio, Leeds In 2002, viewers on the Belmont transmitter transferred to the BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire service, and the service began to use the on-screen name of BBC Yorkshire. This was made official in 2004, when both the Leeds operation, and the East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire operation in Hull, moved into new premises. Studios The first Leeds base for BBC North, upon the launch of regional television was a converted studio in All Souls Church, where the service was based until 1974. From then, the television service moved into Old Broadcasting House at Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, where some services such as BBC Radio Leeds had already been broadcasting. This building was originally the Society of Friends' (Quakers') Carlton Hill Meeting House;A Short History of Leeds Quakers, accessed 5 August 2017 the building itself was of two ages, one part made of stone with columns, and another made of concrete, and featuring the BBC Coat of arms moulded into the front of the building. In 2004, however, the equipment required replacing and new premises were built by Birse Group. All of BBC Yorkshire's Leeds-based facilities moved to the new building, located in St. Peter's Square at Quarry Hill, which included state-of-the-art computer systems, new digital studios for BBC Radio Leeds, and new technology that allowed the programme to be broadcast in widescreen.

The poem is conceived as a chess game in which the opponents are Franci de Castellvi, as White (in modern chess), (Mars Mar√ß, Love Amor and red pieces in the play), and Narcis Vinyoles, playing Black (Venus, the Glory Gloria, and green pieces).Francesco di Castellvi vs Narciso Vinyoles, Valencia, Spain, 1475, Chessgames.com. They debate about love, and Bernat Fenollar comments and establishes the rules. The opening in the game would, centuries later, be called the Scandinavian Defense. Green and Red are still used in xiangqi as colours for the pieces. The poem uses the game as an allegory for love. Its structure is based upon sixty-four stanzas (the same as the number of chessboard squares), nine verses each. The stanzas are grouped three after three: The first stanza in the group represents White's move, the second one Black's move, and the third one a comment on the rules by the arbiter.

The ship was carrying about 1400 passengers and crew. The majority are thought to have been Egyptians working in Saudi Arabia, but they included pilgrims returning from the Hajj in Mecca. The ship was also carrying about 220 vehicles.AP Wire  02/03/2006  Most of 1,400 on doomed ferry feared lost, SanLuisObispo.com. No Mayday had been heard from the ship and poor weather conditions hampered the search and rescue operation. 388 people were rescued. The immediate cause of the sinking appears to have been a build-up of sea- water in the hull, when the fire-fighters were trying to extinguish a fire in the engine-room. This was compounded by design faults inherent in Ro/Ro vessels, where minor flooding of the deck can gain rapid momentum due to the free surface effect. When the captain asked permission to return to port, the ship's owners ordered him to continue, despite knowing that there had been a fire. The owners were jailed in 2009 after their original acquittal was overturned.  Ship history  Tirrenia livery. The vessel was built by the Italian company Italcantieri in 1970 with IMO number 6921282 and named Boccaccio at Monfalcone, Italy for Tirrenia di Navigazione. She was originally intended for Italian domestic service.Overview Press Ltd, Ferries 2004 Southern Europe. Her dimensions were 130.99 m length overall with 23.60 m beam and 5.57 m draft. The main engines were rated at 16,560 kW for a maximum speed of 19 knots. The vessel had an original capacity of 200 automobiles and 1000 passengers. Five sister ships were built. The vessel was rebuilt in 1991 by INMA at La Spezia, maintaining the same outer dimensions albeit with a higher superstructure, changing the draught to 5.90 m. At the same time her automobile capacity was increased to 320 and the passenger capacity was increased to 1,300. The most recent gross registered tonnage was 11,799. Boccaccio was purchased in 1999 by El Salam Maritime Transport, headquartered in Cairo, the largest private shipping company in Egypt and the Middle East, and renamed al-Salam Boccaccio 98 (, Salam ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ means \\"peace\\"); the registered owner is Pacific Sunlight Marine Inc. of Panama. She is also referred to as Salam 98.  The sinking  Its last known position was from Duba, when it lost contact with the shore at about 22:00 EET (20:00 UTC). First reports of statements by survivors indicated that smoke from the engine room was followed by a fire which continued for some time. There were also reports of the ship listing soon after leaving port and that, after continuing for some hours, the list became severe and the ship capsized within 10 minutes as the crew fought the fire. In a BBC radio news broadcast an Egyptian ministerial spokesman said the fire had started in a storage area, was controlled, but started again. The significance of the fire was supported by statements attributed to crew members, who were reported to have claimed that \\"the firefighters essentially sank the ship when sea water they used to battle the fire collected in the hull because drainage pumps were not working.\\" = Weather conditions = The Red Sea is known for its strong winds and tricky local currents. The region had been experiencing high winds and dust storms for several days at the time of the sinking. These winds may have contributed to the disaster and may have complicated rescue efforts. The closest maritime weather reportNational Data Buoy Center. for 3 February 2006 00:00 UTC was from MV Glasgow Maersk, call sign MZGK7. Reporting from 27.00¬∞N 34.40¬∞E, approximately 150 km north-north- west of the sinking, the container ship shows winds of 24.1 kt (13 ms‚àí1) from 320 degrees, with a surface pressure of 1005 hPa. Sea temperature was 25 ¬∞C and a significant wave height of only 45 cm. Visibility was good (10 km), with 7/8 cloud cover. There was also an active weather front overlying the area,:Image:Gfs10.prp.012.tropio.gif clearly visible in METEOSAT imagery.http://oiswww.eumetsat.org/~idds/images/out/SDDI-20060202-2100-BNW-08-IR_108-03-600.jpg = Numbers on board = The ship was carrying 1,312 passengers and 96 crew members, according to Mamdouh Ismail, head of al-Salaam Maritime Transport Company. Earlier an Egyptian official had mentioned 1,310 passengers and 105 crew (however, the Egyptian presidential spokesman mentioned 98 crew, while the Transport Minister said 104). = Possible causes = The reported point where the ship was last observed by coastal radar Several theories have been put forward about possible causes of the sinking. * Fire: Some survivors reported that there was a large fire on board before the ship sank, and there are eyewitness accounts of thick black smoke coming from the engine rooms. * Design flaws: al-Salam Boccaccio 98 was a roll on-roll off (ro-ro) ferry. This design allows vehicles to drive on one end and drive off the other, meaning, in theory, neither the ship nor any of the vehicles onboard need to turn around at any point. It also means that the cargo hold is one long chamber going through the ship. To accomplish this, the vehicle bay doors must be near the waterline; unless these are sealed properly, water may leak through. Even a small amount of water moving about inside can gain momentum and capsize a ship, a phenomenon known as the free surface effect. * Modifications: In the 1980s, the ship was reportedly underwent several modifications, including the addition of two passenger decks and the widening of cargo decks. This may have destabilized the ship past its design limitations, particularly as its draught was only 5.9m. Combined with high winds, the tall ship could have been toppled easily. * Vehicle movement: Another theory is that the rolling of the ship caused one or more of the vehicles in its hold to break loose and puncture a hole in the hull, thereby allowing seawater to flood into the vessel. = Search and rescue = An infrared image from a U.S. Navy aircraft showing a rescue vessel alongside a life raft from al-Salam Boccaccio 98 At 23:58 UTC on 2 February 2006 the air-sea rescue control room at RAF Kinloss in Scotland detected an automatic distress signal relayed by satellite from the ship's position. The alert was passed on via France to the Egyptian authorities. On 3 February 2006 some lifeboats and bodies were seen in the water. At least 314 survivors and around 185 dead bodies were recovered. Reuters reported that \\"dozens\\" of bodies were floating in the Red Sea. Rescue boats and helicopters searched the area, including four Egyptian frigates. Italian Coastal Patrol Unit Ships patrolled for more than 90 hours in severe weather conditions, and eight survivors were rescued by MFO Esploratore-class vessels Vedetta and Sentinella. The United Kingdom diverted the warship HMS Bulwark which would have arrived in a day-and-a-half, but reports conflict as to whether or not the ship was recalled. Israeli sources report that an offer of search and rescue assistance from the Israeli Navy was declined. Egyptian authorities accepted a United States offer of a P-3 Orion maritime naval patrol aircraft after initially having said that the help was not needed. Many survivors reported seeing the captain of the vessel being the first to leave the ship in a lifeboat [AP 2-04-06]. = Similar incidents = *In 1915 the SS Eastland was raised from the Chicago River after capsizing earlier the same year when the ship's limit of 2752 passengers was exceeded; a total of 845 passengers and crew were killed. *The sinking of al-Salam Boccaccio 98 was compared to that of the 1987 MS Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, which killed 193 passengers. *In 1991 another Egyptian ferry, Salem Express, sank off the coast of Egypt after hitting a small habili reef. 464 Egyptians lost their lives. The bodies were recovered and buried on land, as Islam forbids burial at sea. The ship is now a landmark shipwreck for scuba divers along with the SS Thistlegorm. *In 1994, the MS Estonia sank, claiming 852 lives. *On 26 September 2002 the MV Le Joola, a Senegalese government-owned ferry, capsized off the coast of Gambia killing at least 1,863 people. *On 17 October 2005, Pride of al Salam 95 also sank in the Red Sea after being struck by the Cypriot-registered cargo ship Jebal Ali. In that accident, two people were killed and another 40 injured, some possibly during a stampede to leave the sinking ship. After evacuating all the ferry passengers and crew, Jebal Ali went astern and Pride of al Salam 95 sank in about 3¬Ω minutes.  Trial of owners  In July 2008 the owner of al-Salam Boccaccio 98, Mamdouh Ismail, along with his son Amr Ismail and two others were acquitted of wrongdoing in connection with the disaster by an Egyptian court. An earlier parliamentary inquiry blamed Ismail's company for the disaster, saying they had operated the ferry despite serious defects. Also, the recovered data recorder proved that the ferry's owner knew there had been a fire on board but gave orders to continue on instead of returning to port as the captain had requested. Family members of the victims felt the ruling was brought about by corruption as Ismail is a member of Egypt's upper house and is very well connected. On 11 March 2009, after the initial acquittal was overturned in a hearing presided over by Judge Khaled Badereldin, Mamdouh Ismail was sentenced to seven years in prison. Two other employees of the company were sentenced to three years in prison each.

In 2017 China's Beijing Skyrizon Aviation purchased a 41% holding in Motor Sich, but in September 2017 a Ukrainian court froze the holding for national security reasons. Beijing Skyrizon Aviation had agreed to invest $250 million in the Ukrainian plants, and to set up an assembly and servicing plant in Chongqing in southwest China.

It was first established in Baden bei Wien near Vienna by Hungarian musicians who had fled their homeland after it was invaded by Soviet troops. This refugee ensemble gathered together some of Hungary's finest musical talent and was directed by Zolt√°n Rozsnyai, former conductor of the Hungarian National Philharmonic. Through the ardent efforts of Rozsnyai and honorary president Antal Dor√°ti, the Philharmonia Hungarica quickly matured into one of Europe's most distinguished orchestras. During the 1970s, Dor√°ti and the orchestra, under contract with Decca Records, made a recording of the complete cycle of Joseph Haydn's symphonies; only one other ensemble, the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra, conducted by √Åd√°m Fischer, has since repeated this feat. Dor√°ti's recording has been widely reported as a world-first. However, this was not the case. Ernst M√§rzendorfer earlier recorded the complete Haydn symphonies with the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, although it was given a very limited release.Music Web International In 1976 the Philharmonia Hungarica recorded Jon Lord's critically acclaimed 'Sarabande' album, an original collection of movements inspired by the baroque dance suites. From the orchestra's inception, the West German government sought to harness its anti-Soviet propaganda potential. As a result, the government generously funded the orchestra throughout the Cold War and continued extending subsidies even after the Iron Curtain fell in 1990. The full withdrawal of state subsidies at the start of 2001, combined with the long-term decline in concert attendances, aggravated the financial problems that threatened the orchestra's survival. The beleaguered Philharmonia Hungarica finally disbanded after giving a farewell concert in D√ºsseldorf on 22 April 2001, featuring a performance of Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 9 including the Finale (Ed. Nicola Samale, John A. Phillips, Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs and Giuseppe Mazzuca) conducted by Robert Bachmann, as well as the German first performance of the Documentation of the Finale Fragment, edited by John A. Phillips, conducted and presented by Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs. The concert was attended by an estimated audience of 150 in a concert hall meant to hold 2000 (Tonhalle D√ºsseldorf), after members of the German Orchestral Union had falsely announced in public that the concert would be cancelled. Plans to rescue the orchestra failed, because there was no political interest any longer to keep it alive.

The poker variant played on the show is no limit Texas hold 'em. The first 4 seasons ran from January 16, 2006 to December 17, 2007. The last 3 seasons ran from March 1, 2009 to May 21, 2011, and was simulcast in 3DTV on N3D.GSN's 'High Stakes Poker' Joins DirecTV 3D Channel Multichannel News February 7, 2011 The participants on the show include both professional poker players and amateur players. The show was hosted by AJ Benza in the first five seasons, alongside Gabe Kaplan. In the sixth season, Kara Scott replaced Benza as Kaplan's co- host, with Scott conducting interviews from the poker room floor. In the seventh season, Norm Macdonald replaced Gabe Kaplan as Scott's co-host.  Overview  The first season of High Stakes Poker, taped at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, was first broadcast on January 16, 2006, at 9:00 p.m. and consisted of 13 episodes until April 10, 2006, hosted by A. J. Benza and comedian/actor-turned-poker pro Gabe Kaplan. The second season, taped at The Palms and consisting of 16 episodes, premiered on June 5, 2006, and ended on September 18, 2006. The third season, consisting of 13 episodes, was taped at the South Point Casino at 9:00 p.m. and premiered on January 15, 2007, at 9:00 p.m. and ended on April 9, 2007. New players for the third season included Jamie Gold, Phil Ivey, Chris Ferguson, Patrik Antonius, Paul Wasicka, David Benyamine, Brian Townsend and others. Returning players from previous seasons included Doyle Brunson, Daniel Negreanu, Sammy Farha, Phil Laak, Jennifer Harman, Barry Greenstein, Erick Lindgren, Mike Matusow, Brad Booth and others. On April 2, 2007, GSN announced that High Stakes Poker would return for a fourth season, again taped at South Point. Taping was completed in May, with the season premiering on August 27, 2007, at 9:00 p.m. Returning players included Patrik Antonius, David Benyamine, Doyle Brunson, Eli Elezra, Sam Farha, Jamie Gold, Barry Greenstein, Phil Hellmuth Jr., Jennifer Harman, and Daniel Negreanu. Newcomers for the fourth season include Brandon Adams, Mike Baxter, Brian Brandon, Phil Galfond, Guy Lalibert√©, Bob Safai, Antonio Salorio, and Haralabos Voulgaris. The later episodes of this season featured a $500,000 minimum buy-in (compared to the regular $100,000 minimum) and these games saw more than $5 million in play on the table at one time. Season four finished airing on December 17, 2007, and featured 17 episodes. The network cited the show's strong ratings performance in younger demographics. Season five, which ran from March 1, 2009, to May 24, 2009 at 9:00 p.m., was taped at the Golden Nugget on December 19, 2008, to December 21, 2008, and featured a minimum cash buy-in of $200,000. The format for season 5 differed slightly from its predecessors by having Kaplan and Benza not appear on camera until after the first commercial break in the show, rather than at the outset. Season six premiered at 8:00 p.m. on February 14, 2010, and ended on May 9, 2010, with Gabe Kaplan and Kara Scott. It was taped for a second straight season at the Golden Nugget.

The series was filmed in December 2010 at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Sponsored Full Tilt Poker pros were required to boycott the show this time around, as rival site PokerStars became its official sponsors. Thus, \\"High Stakes Poker\\" Season 7 is devoid of such Full Tilt pros as Phil Ivey, Jennifer Harman, Tom Dwan, Patrik Antonius, David Benyamine, Mike Matusow, and Eli Elezra. GSN later announced it would be scaling back its airings of High Stakes Poker after PokerStars pulled out of the U.S. market following the indictments in United States v. Scheinberg et al. crackdown on online gambling.  Format  When it first aired, High Stakes Poker was unique among televised poker series because it did not take place in a tournament setting. Instead, the program showed a high-stakes cash game. The minimum buy-in to the game is US$100,000, but players have bought in for as much as $1,000,000, such as Daniel Negreanu in Season 1 and Brad Booth in Season 3. For part of the fourth season, the minimum buy-in was $500,000. The first episode with the minimum $500,000 buy- in was broadcast on November 5, 2007. The minimum cash buy-in for the fifth season increased to $200,000 ‚Äì the largest buy-in for an entire run of a television series. Unlike in poker tournaments, the chips involved represent real money. If a player loses his or her initial buy-in, that player may rebuy a minimum of $50,000. In addition, players may use cash instead of casino chips. Cash plays and stays as cash in the pot; it does not have to be converted into casino chips. Unlike tournament poker, blinds and antes are constant, instead of increasing as time goes on. High Stakes Poker has $300/$600 blinds with a $100 ante. The fourth season features three forced blinds of $300, $600 and $1,200, with a \\"straddle\\" or optional fourth blind of $2,400. The players include poker professionals along with amateurs such as Jerry Buss and Fred Chamanara. The show was created by executive producer Henry Orenstein. In season one, Daniel Negreanu confirmed in a post on his website's forums that all players were paid $1,250 per hour for taking part and that 13 episodes were edited down from 24 hours of actual play. 2006 WSOP Main Event Champion Jamie Gold commented that players were paid for participating, though they had to put much more money at risk to get to play the game. Gold also spoke about his interactions with other players, particularly Mike Matusow. The theme song for the show is titled \\"I'm All In\\", written and performed by John Pratt, Los Angeles.  Notable hands = Large pots = In Season 2, Gus Hansen won $575,700 with four fives, beating Daniel Negreanu's full house. Hansen raised to $2,100 with , and Negreanu re- raised to $5,000 with , which Hansen called. The pot was $11,700, and the flop came . Hansen checked his set of fives with a 4% chance of winning the hand, and Negreanu bet $8,000 with his set of sixes and a 94% chance of winning. Hansen raised to $26,000 and Negreanu called, bringing the pot to $63,700. The turn came , making Hansen quad fives, leaving Negreanu a 2% underdog with his full house. Hansen bet $24,000, and Negreanu called, slow playing his full house. The pot was now $111,700. The river came . Hansen checked, and Negreanu bet $65,000. Hansen then went all in for his remaining $232,000, bringing the pot to $408,700. Negreanu called, and Hansen won the pot of $575,700. This was the largest pot before the $500,000 minimum buy-in game played during Season 4. In the November 12, 2007, episode of Season 4, Jamie Gold won $495,867 of a $743,800 pot that developed between Gold with three Kings on the turn card, and Patrik Antonius with a straight on the turn card. Antonius held and Gold had pocket K. After the flop and turn, Antonius was a 4-to-1 favorite with his straight vs. Gold's three kings. Gold moved all-in and Antonius called. With such a large amount at stake, the players agreed to run the river (deal the river card) three times. The first river card, , and the second river run, , both paired the board to give two wins to Gold with a full house. The third river run, , kept Antonius' straight in front. As a result, Gold won $495,867 from the pot and Antonius won $247,933. Antonius' calm demeanor after the hand prompted host A.J. Benza to comment, \\"I'll tell you one thing: Patrik can take a punch. Imagine if that was Phil Hellmuth.\\" In Season 5, Tom Dwan (pictured) won a $919,600 pot against Barry Greenstein In the November 26, 2007 episode of Season 4, Doyle Brunson won a $818,100 pot against Guy Lalibert√©. Brunson held and Lalibert√© . The flop came and the turn was . Brunson bet the turn, and Laliberte raised and Brunson moved all-in and was called. The players agreed to run the river twice. Brunson was a 75% favorite with his better kicker and flush draw, and he won both times to take the entire pot. After the hand, Brunson said, \\"When you don't make a pair for eight hours, you go crazy.\\" Later in that same November 26, 2007, episode of Season 4, Patrik Antonius won $749,100 from a $998,800 pot that developed between Antonius with a pair of nines on the flop, and Sammy Farha with a king-high flush draw. Antonius went all-in after the flop and Farha called. The odds were roughly even, and the players agreed to run the turn and river four times. Antonius won three times to take three-quarters of the pot, $749,100, while Farha won $249,700. In Season 4, Guy Lalibert√© and David Benyamine created a pot of $1,227,900 ‚Äî the largest in High Stakes Poker history ‚Äî before negotiating a reduction of the pot to \\"only\\" $238,900. David had and Lalibert√© had and the flop came giving Lalibert√© top two pair and Benyamine the nut flush draw. Acting after Farha, Benyamine raised to $43,000 and Lalibert√© reraised to $168,000. Farha folded his , Benyamine went all-in, and Lalibert√© called, bringing the pot to $1,227,900. After turning the respective cards over, Lalibert√©, knowing he was the favorite, offered to run it once or twice. After further negotiation, Lalibert√© offered to take the pot previous to the raises of $238,900. Benyamine agreed. Antonio Esfandiari and a couple of other players wanted to see the turn and river, but Lalibert√© and Benyamine refused. In Season 5, Tom Dwan won the biggest pot ‚Äî $919,600 ‚Äî to be played straight up (with no side-deals or multiple runs). Dwan won with three Queens, beating Barry Greenstein's two pair ‚Äì Aces and Queens. Peter Eastgate was the original raiser with , with Greenstein re-raising to $15,000 with , Dwan calling with and Eastgate calling behind him. The flop came , causing Dwan to bet on his pair of Queens and a King high flush draw, Eastgate to fold, Greenstein to raise with his pair of Aces and backdoor straight draw, Dwan to reraise, and finally Greenstein to push all-in, which Dwan quickly called. Greenstein had turned down Dwan's offer to run it twice on an earlier hand (in which Dwan had the best hand when they went all-in, though Greenstein ultimately won), and this time Greenstein again wanted to run it only once, but offered to take some of their money back, which Dwan turned down stating \\"sorry...no\\" Commentator Gabe Kaplan noted the comparison with the earlier hand when Greenstein would not run it twice. At this point, it was almost an exactly even race. The turn was the , and the river the , so Dwan won the pot of $919,600. = Large bluffs = In Season 3, Brad Booth with executed a successful bluff against Phil Ivey, (then) leading with , in a pot that stood at $31,100 pre-flop. The flop came ; Ivey's overpair was a 79% favorite to Booth's inside straight draw and backdoor flush draw. After Ivey bet $23,000 on the flop to make the pot $54,100, Booth raised to $300,000. Ivey folded. At the beginning of Season 4, the players agreed that anyone who won a pot while holding the weakest possible hold 'em hand (2‚Äì7) would be paid $500 by every other player at the table. This led to several five-figure bluffs that were calculated to pick up the $3,500 bonus (and the respect of the table). Phil Hellmuth won the 7-2 bonus in the second televised hand of the season, making a $40,000 bet on the river that caused Mike Matusow to lay down pocket Kings. The biggest unsuccessful bluff occurred as a result of this $500 for 2‚Äì7 rule. Amateurs Antonio Salorio and Brian Brandon went to a raised flop with 2‚Äì7 and K-K respectively. When Brandon flopped the best possible hand with K-4-K, Salorio continued to bet hard on his 2‚Äì7 bluff, eventually losing more than $100,000 of his own bets before giving up when Brandon raised on the turn. In Season 5, Tom Dwan executed a successful bluff against Barry Greenstein and Peter Eastgate in a pot that stood at $133,500 pre-bluff. Dwan won with a pair of tens against Barry Greenstein's higher pair of Aces and Peter Eastgate's (then) leading trip deuces. Greenstein, with , opened the play under the gun to $2,500 and was quickly called by all players. Before the flop came out there was $21,400 in the pot and at this point, Dwan jokingly offered to chop the pot. The flop was . Eastgate, with trip deuces on his , and Doyle Brunson with , both checked. Greenstein led out with $10,000 after some thought, and with seven people behind him, Dwan raised the pot to $37,300. David Benyamine (), Eli Elezra (), Ilari Sahamies () and Daniel Negreanu () all quickly folded. The action came back to Eastgate, who called, as did Greenstein. With the pot already at $133,500, the turn came a , and Eastgate and Greenstein quickly checked. After some thought, Dwan (a 95% underdog at this point) bet $104,200, causing Eastgate and Greenstein to reluctantly fold. Following the hand, Dwan was quick to announce he was bluffing by stating, \\"Peter had the best hand, I'll make a sidebet that Peter had the best hand.\\" Doyle Brunson accepted, and eventually lost $9,000 when Peter, after a $1,000 bribe from Dwan, announced he had a trip deuces a few episodes later. After the hand was done, commentator Gabe Kaplan said that the only other person he knew who would have made a similar move was \\"maybe the late Stu Ungar\\". In Season 6, Tom Dwan executed a successful bluff against Phil Ivey in a pot that stood at $408,700 pre-bluff. Tom Dwan () raised $25,000 preflop and got called by Phil Ivey with (). After a flop of (), Dwan fired another $45,800 and Ivey called, making the pot $162,300. The turn came (), and Dwan fired again, this time $123,200. Ivey again called with his flush and inside straight draws, creating a pot of $408,700. The river came (), leaving Ivey with a small pair and Dwan with 9 high. Dwan bet another $268,200. Ivey considered calling for over 3 minutes (according to the TV show), but ultimately folded. In Season 7, amateur player Bill Klein opted to see the river in a $192,800 pot, by calling the re-raise to $67,000 by professional Phil Galfond of his $28,000 bet. Klein held for a flush draw, and Galfond, holding , had a straight on a board that read . The river card was the , which prompted Klein to take a glance at Galfond from under his hat. \\"Looks like Klein's creative juices may be flowing\\", quipped commentator Norm Macdonald, as Klein slid a tower of 30 $5,000 chips forward equalling $150,000. After Galfond folded, Bill Klein showed the bluff and received a standing ovation and fist-bumps from around the table. = Quick loss = In a single episode of Season 6, Daniel Negreanu lost a total of $380,000 in two hands, both to Mike Matusow. In the first hand, Negreanu went all-in on trip nines, holding on a board. Matusow, however, had flopped a full house since he held .

St. Augustine met him at Milan about 383, or perhaps a little later (St. Augustine, Ep. ccxxii). He composed a catalogue of heresies (Diversarum Hereseon Liber) about 384. He died before 397. Among the writings of St. Gaudentius was a sermon purporting to be preached on the fourteenth anniversary of St. Philastrius's death. According to this sermon, Philastrius's life began with a great act of renunciation, for which he might fitly be compared to Abraham. Later he was ordained priest, and travelled over nearly the whole Roman world (circumambiens Universum pene ambitum Romani Orbis), preaching against pagans, Jews, and heretics, especially the Arians. Like St. Paul he carried in his body the \\"stigmata\\" of Christ, having been scourged for his zeal against the last-named heretics. At Milan he was a great stay of the Catholic party in the time of St. Ambrose's Arian predecessor. At Rome he held both private and public disputations with heretics, and converted many. His wanderings ceased when he was made Bishop of Brescia. Doubts were first raised by Louis Ellies du Pin as to the genuineness of this sermon, and these have been reiterated by Marx, the latest editor of Philastrius, who thinks the sermon a forgery of the eighth or ninth century. The chief objection to its genuineness, rather a weak one, seems to be that it is not found in the manuscripts containing the undoubted sermons of St. Gaudentius. Marx was answered by Knappe, \\"Ist die 21 Rede des hl. Gaudentius (Oratio B. Gaudentii de Vita et Obitu B. Filastrii episcopi pr√¶decessoris sui) echt? Zugleich ein Betrag zur Latinit√§t des Gaudentius\\" (Osnabr√ºck), who endeavours to prove the genuineness of the sermon in question by linguistic arguments. His Bollandist reviewer thinks he has made a strong case (Anal. Boll., XXVIII, 224). Richard Adelbert Lipsius discovered that in Philastrius's \\"Catalogue\\" of heresies, for the Christian heresies up to Noetus, the compiler drew from the same source as Epiphanius of Salamis, i. e. the lost Syntagma of Hippolytus. By the aid, therefore, of these two and the Pseudo-Tertullian Adversus Omnes Haereses it has been possible in great measure to reconstruct the lost treatise of Hippolytus. Philastrius' comments and spellings do not always accord with those of Epiphanius or Pseudo-Tertullian, for example his description of Nazaraei does not match well with either the Nasaraioi or Nazoraioi which Epiphanius attempts to distinguish.Edwin K. Broadhead Jewish Ways of Following Jesus: Redrawing the Religious Map of 2010 p178 \\"52 Filaster apparently has another group in mind when he refers to Nazaraei. His description of them elsewhere does not match well with the Nazarenes of Epiphanius. Even if Filaster means the Nazarenes, he may be dependent on Epiphanius\\" ReferencesEditions *The first edition of the \\"Catalogue\\" was published at Basle (1528) *F.

In 2005, Sands' book Lawless World catalysed legal and public debate in the UK on the legality of the 2003 Iraq War. The book addresses a range of topics including the Pinochet trial in London, the creation of the International Criminal Court, the War on Terror and the establishment of the detention camp at Guant√°namo Bay. In the second edition of Lawless World (2006) Sands revealed that the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair had told President George W. Bush that he would support US plans to invade Iraq before he had sought legal advice about the invasion's legality. Sands exposed a memorandum dated 31 January 2003 that described a two-hour meeting between Blair and Bush, during which Bush discussed the possibility of luring Saddam Hussein's forces to shoot down a Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, an act that would cause Iraq to be in breach of UN Security Council Resolutions. The memo disclosed that Blair told Bush that he would support US plans to go to war in the absence of a second UN Security Council Resolution, apparently contradicting an assurance given by Blair in the UK Parliament shortly afterwards on 25 February 2003. Sands has maintained the view that there was no basis in international law for military action in Iraq.Philippe Sands' Letter to the Chilcot Inquiry (10 September 2010) ; accessed 18 April 2016. Sands' 2008 book Torture Team sets out in detail the role of senior lawyers in the Bush administration in authorising torture (including so-called ‚Äòenhanced interrogation techniques‚Äô at Guant√°namo Bay). As a result of his work on Torture Team, Sands was invited to give oral and written evidence to the UK and Dutch Parliaments, as well as to the US House of Representatives and the US Senate: * UK House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs (1 June 2004) * UK House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs (April 2006) * US House of Representative Committee on the Judiciary (6 May 2008)Philippe Sands Evidence to the US House of Representatives , 6 May 2008; accessed 18 April 2016. * US Senate Committee on the Judiciary (19 June 2008)Philippe Sands Evidence to the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 19 June 2008; accessed 18 April 2016. * Dutch Parliamentary Inquiry: Davids Commission (September 2009) In 2009 Jane Mayer reported in The New Yorker on Sands' reaction to news that Spanish jurist Baltazar Garzon had received motions requesting that six former Bush officials might be charged with war crimes. From 2010 to 2012, he served as a Commissioner on the UK Government Commission on a Bill of Human Rights. The Commission's Report was published in December 2012.A UK Bill of Rights? The Choice Before Us, nationalarchives.gov.uk; accessed 18 April 2016. Sands and Baroness Kennedy disagreed with the majority, and their dissent (\\"In Defence of Rights\\") was published in the London Review of Books. Sands and Kennedy expressed concern that support for a UK Bill of Rights was motivated by a desire for the UK to withdraw from the European Convention of Human Rights. Writing in The Guardian in May 2015, Sands argued that plans for a British Bill of Rights could leave some people in the UK with more rights than others and that this would be \\"inconsistent with the very notion of fundamental human rights, in which every human being has basic minimum rights.\\" On 17 September 2015 Sands gave a public lecture at the UK Supreme Court entitled \\"Climate Change and the Rule of Law: Adjudicating the Future in International Law\\".Climate Change and the Rule of Law: Adjudicating the Future in international Law, kcl.ac.uk, 17 September 2015. He expressed the view that a ruling by an international judicial body, such as the International Court of Justice, could help resolve the scientific dispute on climate change and be authoritative and legally dispositive. In December 2015, Sands (and two colleagues at Matrix Chambers) drafted a Legal Opinion on the legality of UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia for Amnesty International, Oxfam and Saferworld. The Opinion concluded that by authorising the transfer of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the UK government was acting in breach of its obligations under the Arms Trade Treaty, the EU Common Position on Arms Exports and the UK's Consolidated Criteria on Arms Exports. On 16 April 2018, Sands co-authored a piece in The Times in which it is argued that the UK had no established legal basis for the 2018 missile strikes against Syria. Writing, theatre and film Sands is a contributor to the Financial Times and The Guardian and occasional contributor to the London Review of Books and Vanity Fair. Sands frequently comments on issues of international law and is a contributor to BBC programmes, Sky News, CNN, Al Jazeera and national radio and TV stations around the world. His written work has formed the basis for three staged productions exploring the public and historical impact of international law: * Called to Account, a staged inquiry into the legal issues surrounding the Iraq War (performed at Tricycle Theatre in April 2007); * Staged readings of Torture Team (performed at the Tricycle Theatre in 2009, Hay Festival in 2010, and the Long Wharf Theatre in 2011); * A Song of Good and Evil (performed at South Bank's Purcell Room on 29‚Äì30 November 2014, Stockholm's Berwaldhallen on 14 January 2015, Nuremberg Courtroom 600 at the invitation of the German Government to mark 70th anniversary of the opening day of the Nuremberg Trials on 21 November 2015, and Montauban's Th√©√¢tre Olympe de Gouges on 28 November 2015). It has also been performed at Kings Place in London, and in Australia, Istanbul, Brussels, The Hague and New York. Sands' book East West Street: On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity (2016) has been translated into twenty languages. It formed the basis for the documentary My Nazi Legacy: What Our Fathers Did. The film is directed by David Evans and premiered in April 2015 at the Tribeca Film Festival. It was released in the US on 6 November 2015 and in the UK on 20 November 2015. Sands wrote the script and appears in the film alongside two sons of prominent Nazi officials, Niklas Frank (the son of Hans Frank, the Governor-General of occupied Poland) and Horst von W√§chter (the son of Otto W√§chter, the Governor of Krak√≥w in Poland and Galicia in Ukraine). The documentary, which explores the relationship between the two sons and their fathers, won the Yad Vashem Chairman's Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival and was nominated Best Documentary at the Stockholm Film Festival and at the Evening Standard British Film Awards. In 2018, Sands wrote and presented the BBC Radio 4 documentary Intrigue: The Ratline about the disappearance of senior Nazi Otto W√§chter, investigating the \\"ratlines\\" by which he escaped justice.. Sands has since published a book on this topic. In 2019, he published an Introduction to Franz Kafka's The Trial. In 2020, he published The Ratline: Love, Lies and Justice on the Trail of a Nazi Fugitive.

L√≥pez (born 1942) is an American painter, printmaker, educator and film producer living in San Francisco, California. She is known for works focusing on the experiences of Mexican-American women, often challenging the ethnic stereotypes associated with them. Biography Yolanda L√≥pez was born in 1942 in San Diego, California, USA, and is a third-generation Chicana. Her grandparents migrated from Mexico to the United States, crossing the R√≠o Bravo river in a boat while avoiding gunfire from the Texas Rangers. L√≥pez and her two younger siblings were raised by her mother and maternal grandparents in San Diego. After graduating from high school in Logan Heights in San Diego, she moved to San Francisco and attended San Francisco State University (SFSU). She became involved in a student movement called the Third World Liberation Front,, which shut down SFSU in a 1968 strike called the \\"Third World Liberation Front Strikes.\\" She also became active in the arts. During this time, L√≥pez became aware of how her ethnicity determined her position in society. She is quoted saying, \\"I did not become aware of our own history until 1968 when there was a call for a strike at San Francisco State, a strike for ethnic studies. I heard the men and women who led that Third World Strike speak and I understood at that point what my position was being part of this long legacy of being part of the oppressed people, just like black people.\\" In 1969, L√≥pez was instrumental in advertising the case of Los Siete De Le Rasa, in which seven young Latin American youths accused of killing a police officer. She designed the poster \\"Free Los Siete,\\" which juxtaposed the jailed Latin Americans with the ideals of America. This poster, as part of L√≥pez's efforts on the Los Siete Defense Committee, helped garner much community support, and win their eventual acquittal. During the 1970s, L√≥pez returned to San Diego, and enrolled at San Diego State University in 1971, graduating in 1975 with a B.A. in painting and drawing. She enrolled at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), receiving a Master of Fine Arts in 1979. While at the University of California, San Diego, her professors Allan Sekula and Martha Rosler encouraged her to focus on conceptual practice with social, political, and educational impact. In 1978, L√≥pez and conceptual artist Ren√© Ya√±ez moved to San Francisco's Mission District, and in 1980 she gave birth to R√≠o Ya√±ez.Davalos, Karen Mary (2008). Yolanda L√≥pez. Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press. . A few years later, L√≥pez moved into the apartment next door and maintained a professional relationship with Ya√±ez. After 40 years of living in her home, in 2014, she and her family faced eviction through the Ellis Act. In response, she created a series of \\"eviction garage sales\\" to comment on issues of gentrification and cultural heritage in San Francisco. According to the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Press (2009), \\"L√≥pez‚Äôs artwork aims to offer new possibilities for Chicanas and women of color living under conditions of patriarchy, racism, and material inequality.\\" Her contributions to the Chicana society and feminism are seen as significant. Work L√≥pez became an international celebrity for her iconic Virgen de Guadalupe series of drawings, prints, collage, assemblage, and paintings. The series, which depicted \\"ordinary\\" Mexican women (including her grandmother, her mother and L√≥pez herself) with Guadalupan attributes (such as the mandorla), attracted praise for \\"sanctifying\\" average Mexican women, who were depicted performing domestic and other labor. The 1978 triptych oil pastel drawings depict herself and her family members as reimagined Virgin de Guadalupe figures, wherein L√≥pez depicts herself clutching a snake while stepping on an angel, a symbol of the patriarchy. The Virgen De Guadalupe series depicted the range of domestic womanhood to Chicana womanhood, to intersectionality. The series also revealed the close bond in L√≥pez's family and demonstrated the cycle of life as a whole. Different paintings in the series give completely different feelings according to the message she wanted to bring to the viewers. She touched on the role of women in generations, with respect to the society's expectations on them. In terms of Chicana womanhood, the series emphasized traditional cultural values, and advocated new perceptions of gender and cultural identity. L√≥pez further integrated internationalist in to the series by embedding the overlapping of roles regarding gender difference and cultural stereotypes. Woman's Work is Never Done is another set of prints. One of them, entitled The Nanny, attempted to study some problems faced by immigrant women of Hispanic descent in the United States. The work was featured at the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art. Her famous political poster titled Who's the Illegal Alien, Pilgrim? features an angry young man in an Aztec headdress and traditional jewelry holding a crumpled-up paper titled \\"Immigration Plans.\\" This 1978 poster was created during a period of political debate in the U.S. which resulted in the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1978 that limited immigration from a single country to 20,000 people per year with a total cap of 290,000. L√≥pez has also curated exhibitions, including Cactus Hearts/Barb Wired Dreams, which featured works of art concerning immigration to the United States. The exhibition debuted at the Galer√≠a de la Raza and subsequently toured nationwide as part of an exhibition called La Frontera/The Border: Art About the Mexico/United States Border Experience. L√≥pez has produced two films: Images of Mexicans in the Media and When you Think of Mexico, which challenge the way the mass media depicts Mexicans and other Latin Americans. She served as Director of Education at the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts in San Francisco, and has taught at University of California, Berkeley, Mills College, and Stanford University. According to L√≥pez, \\"It is important for us to be visually literate; it is a survival skill. The media is what passes for culture in contemporary U.S. society, and it is extremely powerful. It is crucial that we systematically explore the cultural mis-definition of Mexicans and Latin Americans that is presented in the media.\\"  Selected artwork =Things I never told my son about being a Mexican= Things I never told my Son about being a Mexican was a featured as a piece in L√≥pez's exhibition Cactus Hearts/Barb Wired Dreams in 1988. The piece touches on identity, assimilation, and cultural change; it consists of different three- dimensional items attached to a large yellow backdrop with a zigzag border on the top and a barbed wire border on the bottom. The bottom text reads: \\"THINGS I NEVER TOLD MY SON ABOUT BEING A MEXICAN\\". Items in the work vary from cactus cutouts, to children's clothing, to pictures. The work's message ranges from embracing one's culture to addressing the oppression and discrimination faced in America, as the two borders can represent the literal borders between the United States and Mexico. It can also be connected to L√≥pez's \\"culture shock\\" experience after going to college, where she realized that she knew nothing about her own Mexican heritage or cultural history.Laduke, Betty. ‚ÄúYolanda L√≥pez: Breaking Chicana Stereotypes.‚Äù Feminist Studies, vol. 20, no. 1, Spring 1994, p. 117. EBSCOhost, doi:10.2307/3178436. Things I never told my Son about being a Mexican is also another one of L√≥pez's art pieces that emphasizes the breaking away of the typical Chicana/o art style. Things I never told my son about being a Mexican addresses her son, R√≠o Ya√±ez, who was only nine years old at the time. In terms of relevance to the Chicana/o art scene this piece stands towards the end of the current peak of the movement. The typical Chincana/o art style normally consists of bright colorful paintings or murals. However, in this work, the atypical color scheme of Chicana/o art is eye catching; the work does not use a large amount of colors at all and can be considered simplistic. What also makes the piece unique is the message, arrangement, and the bright background color. The traditional Mexican children's clothing possibly represent the innocence she held before her \\"culture shock\\" in college. In terms of flow with positive and negative space, the artwork moves vertically from the top to the bottom from a positive space to a negative space, starting with a playful red zigzag pattern that stands out and ending with a grey barbed wire pattern that is seemingly hidden in comparison to the sharpness of the red. The piece depicts the unawareness of L√≥pez's own culture and possibly serves as a warning or lesson for her son, warning him not to let American culture drown out their heritage and cultural history. The work is textured and three dimensional, as it is a mixed media collage, rather than a painting. The children's clothes stick out and protrude from the warm yellow background wall, even the barbed wire is brought to life as a result of the angles of the barbed edges being drawn from an aerial perspective. As Karen Mary Davalos argues, \\"L√≥pez intentionally selected these objects for their mundane or everyday quality so that she could support her argument about the ubiquitous nature of stereotypical images. The images of sleeping Mexicans, smiling se√±oritas, and dancing fruits and vegetables are made absurd through unexpected placement, juxtaposition, and repetition. Her work interrogates images of Mexicans and Chicanos, and it challenges not only the context in which fine art is displayed but also the assumptions about who should be invited into such elite spaces.\\" =The Guadalupe series= Beginning in 1978 and ending in 1988, Yolanda L√≥pez's Virgen de Guadalupe series gained L√≥pez a high amount of recognition by depicting not only people close to her as the Virgen de Guadalupe, but also by reimagining the image in different forms. This drew in the public eye with these new, albeit controversial, depictions of the Virgen de Guadalupe. However, starting a controversy was not L√≥pez's intention. In \\"American Women: Great lives from History\\", Mary K. Trigg offers a perspective into the lives of American women spanning from colonial time up to the present day, and discusses their work in politics, civil rights, literature, education, journalism, science, business, and sports. In a section on L√≥pez, Trigg writes, \\"L√≥pez's formal education and burgeoning feminism contributed to her growing interest in the politics of representation, resulting in work that progressively examined the social and cultural invisibility of women\\". L√≥pez wanted to depict the Virgen de Guadalupe in numerous ways: to give women, specifically those originating from Chicana culture, new forms of representation along with L√≥pez's own comments on society. As Guisela M. Latorre argues, \\"[i]mages such as Ester Hern√°ndez‚Äôs 1976 etching Libertad depicting a young Chicana resculpting the Statue of Liberty to resemble a Maya carving, and Yolanda L√≥pez‚Äôs pastel drawings (1978) that depicted herself, her mother, and her grandmother in the role of the Virgin of Guadalupe were examples of early Chicana art that placed women at the center of discourses on liberation and decolonization\\". Virgen de Guadalupe The Virgen De Guadalupe To better understand why L√≥pez wanted to depict the Virgen de Guadalupe in multiple ways, one must understand what the religious figure stood for. It is one of the most recognizable religious figures in the world and one of the most important figures to the people of Mexico. She is a symbol of love, faith, and identity. However, not all the symbolism could be perceived as purely positive; the Virgen de Guadalupe also symbolizes motherhood, virginity, and femininity, which L√≥pez felt the need to not only address but also critique in her work. In \\"Yolanda L√≥pez: Breaking Chicana stereotypes\\", Betty Laduke goes into more detail about L√≥pez's true goal for her Virgen de Guadalupe series. Laduke quotes L√≥pez saying: \\"I feel living, breathing women also deserve the respect and love lavished on Guadalupe ... It is a call to look at women, hardworking, enduring and mundane, as the heroines of our daily routine... We privately agonize and sometimes publicly speak out on the representation of us in the majority culture. But what about the portrayal of ourselves in our own culture? Who are our heroes, our role models?... It is dangerous for us to wait around for the dominant culture to define and validate what role models we should have.\\" L√≥pez aims to not only praise women through her Virgen de Guadalupe but to offer young women a role model with a familiar face. When looking at the original depiction of the Virgen de Guadalupe one notices a luminous light that outlines the virgin. This light represents God's heavenly light, and that the Virgen de Guadalupe is indeed blessed by his light. The crescent moon symbolizes her virginity, the angel that supports her and carries her is a symbol of her importance as the heavenly queen. In the Christian faith, her turquoise shawl with golden stars symbolizes her eternal life, while the bow around her waist is a symbol of her virginity, and the swelling of her abdomen shows that she is indeed carrying a child. However, she most importantly symbolizes maternity. It could even be argued that the Virgen de Guadalupe establishes gender roles, which works with the idea of a holy women who is a virgin untouched by sin, a woman carrying a child from God, and a mother ready to give her child love and affection. Although many artists opt to make original artwork, some, like L√≥pez, redesign an impactful cultural image in order to change a viewer's point of view and offer an alternative interpretation. Her paintings did the opposite, showing how Mexican women should look and it bothered her. The painting shows how Mexican women should be gracefully, skinny, young, and \\"good\\". L√≥pez explains in the original Virgin that she is \\"bound by the excess cloth around her legs that makes her immobile\\". L√≥pez was tired of seeing stereotypical paintings of Mexican American women so she made her own three-piece series to truly capture the beauty of Mexican women, and two important women in her life, her mother and grandmother. She wanted to show the three generations for her series going from young, to middle, and to old age. The Artist as the Virgen of Guadalupe painting shows L√≥pez herself running out of the picture frame, smiling with her running shoes as if competing in a race, wearing Mary's shawl as a cape, and jumping over the red, white, and blue angel, showing pride in her culture, and finally holding a snake to demonstrate the strength she holds. L√≥pez explains this imagery, saying \\"[s]he holds the Guadalupe cloak like a cape at the end of a race and jumps over the angel with red, white, and blue wings a symbol of the United States capitalism\\". In \\"Yolanda L√≥pez: Breaking Chicana Stereotypes\\" Laduke explains, \\"L√≥pez not only commands her body but seems but seems to predict her role as an artist who is not afraid of encountering social and political issues or using her skills to promote social change\\". L√≥pez is not afraid to challenge society or to change what has been falsely represented in Mexican culture, through images of the Virgin Mary, and through images projecting how young women and mothers should look or behave a certain way. Through her art, L√≥pez challenges her culture. As Karen Mary Davalos asserts, \\"L√≥pez consistently confronts predominant modes of Latino and Latina representations, proposing new models of gender, racial, and cultural identity\\". L√≥pez says of her intended viewer: \\"Over the years as I have created my art, I have tried to address an audience, a Chicano audience, specifically a California Chicano audience\\". She addressed this audience with her work, gearing it towards Mexican American/Chicana women in California. Alma L√≥pez says, \\"Yolanda stated that by doing these portraits of her mother, grandmother, and herself she wanted to draw attention and pay homage to working class women, old women, middle-aged overweight women, young, and self- assertive women\\". L√≥pez's Nuestra Madre (1981‚Äì88, acrylic and oil paint on masonite, 4 x 6 feet), is one of the portraits in her Virgin of Guadalupe series in which she transformed original images of the Virgen de Guadalupe to offer viewers new insight. Her depiction of the virgin in Nuestra Madre depicts an older and more ancient stone figure, harkening back to the importance of the Mexican and Chicano/a community today. In Nuestra Madre L√≥pez likens the portrait to an ancient goddess. During the 16th-century, people saw the Virgin of Guadalupe as connected to the ancient goddess Tonantzin. Tonantzin is an ancient Aztec goddess the people of Mexico would worship in Tepeyac when the Spaniards had not yet colonized Mexico. Later, she was then disguised to look different so that the Spaniards would allow them to keep her as a religious image that was acceptable to their newer foreign religion of Catholicism. L√≥pez decided to remove the disguise of the Virgin of Guadalupe that was placed on Tonantzin, before she was covered to assimilate into the church of this new religion being forced onto the people of Mexico. L√≥pez wanted to bring that part of Mexican history back because she wanted Chicano/as to know their history and she does not want them to forget that part of themselves that was hidden. Not only is the Virgin of Guadalupe an ancient goddess but she is also a feminist symbol, but she is seen as a protector and a leader to the people in poverty. Even though the Virgin de Guadalupe is seen as a gentlewoman, she is strong and powerful, and someone for men look to for help because she is their savior and they see her as an equal. As Karen Mary Davalos explains, L√≥pez's \\"intent was not to explore the Virgen de Guadalupe‚Äôs divinity but to deconstruct the image 'to see how we present ourselves'. L√≥pez‚Äôs deconstruction of images of women such as the Virgen de Guadalupe was an effort to acknowledge the complex social and historical conditions that inform the experiences of Mexican and Mexican American women\\". L√≥pez's Virgin of Guadalupe series is one that shows women as powerful beings who are not simply caregivers, objects, housewives; instead they are powerful goddesses who are capable of so much more, which is powerful within itself.  ¬øA Donde Vas, Chicana?  While attending the University of California, San Diego, Yolanda Lopez created ¬øA Donde Vas, Chicana?, English for ‚ÄúWhere are you going, Chicana?‚Äù, Getting through College series as part of her MFA exhibition in 1977.http://www.chicano.ucla.edu/files/LopezGuide.pdf The four by five feet canvas painted with acrylic and oil portrays a toned Lopez as the runner jogging intensely across a college campus in a tank top and shorts with her hair pulled back. She based this painting on her experience of running to get in shape and have control over her body. In the journal article ‚ÄúYolanda Lopez: Breaking Chicana Stereotypes‚Äù, Betty LaDuke interviews Lopez and she informs us that the series was presented from the perspective of \\"a woman calling on her body in an assertive and physically disciplined manner as a power ally. She also comments on the runner‚Äôs noteworthiness saying, \\"It is female. It is Chicana. It is a self-portrait. The metaphor extends from the symbolic fortitude of women to the literal image of a Chicana's struggle in a formidable institution.\\" Lopez then analyzes a runner‚Äôs ‚Äúshort-lived speed with women's psychological and physical sustaining power of endurance.\\" She ends the interview with a strong and clear message, \\"Endurance is one of our greatest survival tools.\\"  Select exhibitions  1993 - La Frontera / The Border: Art about the Mexico/United States Border Experience, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, San Diego, California 1997 - Mirror, Mirror...

He was the younger son of Vallabhacharya, who founded the Pushtimarg religious sect of Hinduism.  Names  The name Vitthalanatha is also pronounced as Vitthalnath in modern vernaculars because of schwa deletion. His other names include Vitthaleshvara (IAST: Vi·π≠·π≠hale≈õvara), Vitthala Dikshita, or Agnikumara. In addition, he is known by the title Gosvami (Gosain-ji or Gusain-ji).  Early life  Vitthalanatha was born around 1516 (between 1515 and 1518), as the second son of the religious scholar Vallabha. His devotees consider him an incarnation of the god Vithoba (Vitthal) of Pandharpur. He was brought up by Vallabha till the age of 15, and after that, by Vallabha's disciple Damodara-dasa. He was proficient in the Vedas, the Brahma Sutra, and the Mimansa philosophy. He studied nyaya at Navadvipa.  Religious activities  After the deaths of his father Vallabhacharya (c. 1530), his elder brother Gopinatha, and Gopinatha's son Purushottama (c. 1550), Vitthalanatha emerged as the main leader of the religious sect established by his father. Initially, he faced some opposition from Krishnadasa, a manager of the Shrinathji Temple. Krishnadasa banned Vitthalanatha from entering the temple because of personal disputes, but later, reconciled with him. Vitthalanatha forgave him, and made him in-charge of the Govardhan Hill temple. Vitthalanatha propagated the teachings of his father, and established a religious centre at Gokul.

After giving birth to a still-born baby at age 19, she found spiritual comfort listening to sermons by a preacher of a church centered on the brotherhood of man. It was these sermons that formed the nucleus of the creation of The Guiding Light, which began as a radio show. From 1937 to 1946, the show was broadcast from Chicago on the NBC radio network. Cast of the show in December 1940. Front row from left: Ruth Bailey (Rose Kransky), Gladys Heene (Torchy Reynolds), Dr. John Ruthledge, Mignon Schreiber (Mrs. Kransky), Muriel Bremner (Fredericka Lang), Betty Arnold (Iris Marsh), Back row from left: Bill Bouchey (Charles Cunningham), Paul Barnes (Jack Felzer), Phil Dakin (Ellis Smith), Seymour Young (Jacob Kransky) The show was cancelled by NBC twice, once in 1939 and once in 1946. The first time on October 13, 1939, it was brought back by popular demand of the listening audience and began again only four months later on January 22, 1940. (Although some of the characters, Rose Kransky and part of her family, briefly transitioned to another Phillips' creation, The Right to Happiness, with Phillips bringing back the characters to The Guiding Light when NBC restarted the show.) The November 29, 1946 NBC cancellation coincided with the Federal Communications Commission forcing a split of NBC and the creation of the ABC network. CBS would pick up the show seven months later on June 2, 1947. CBS would be where the show would stay until its cancellation on television in September 2009. Procter & Gamble was the original sponsor of The Guiding Light until March 16, 1942, when General Mills started sponsorship. Procter & Gamble would again sponsor the show when CBS picked up the show on June 2, 1947. The show started in the locale of Five Points, a fictional enclave neighborhood of Chicago, but in 1947 when CBS brought back the show the locale transitioned to the fictional suburb of Los Angeles, Selby Flats. From 1943 to 1946, The Guiding Light and two other Phillips-created soaps (Woman in White and Today's Children) were aired as a programming block known collectively as The General Mills Hour, with Guiding Light cast member Ed Prentiss acting as master of ceremonies. Major characters made crossover appearances between the three shows, and at one point during this period, Phillips considered the experiment of running the individual program segments longer or shorter than the then- traditional quarter-hour. However, the Hour was disbanded before Phillips could proceed further with the idea. From 1947 to 1949, the show was broadcast from Hollywood, but in the fall of 1949 the show moved to New York City where it remained or was based until the show was canceled in September 2009.

John Ruthledge and all the people of a fictional suburb in Chicago called Five Points. The townspeople's lives had revolved around him. The show's title refers to a lamp in his study that family and residents could see as a sign for them to find help when needed. Early ongoing storylines contrasted Ellis Smith (nicknamed Mr Nobody from Nowhere) with Rev. Ruthledge, the former's cynicism often acting as a foil to the optimism of the latter. Rev. Ruthledge's daughter Mary also embarked on a secret romance with her foster brother Ned Holden. Ned and Mary would eventually marry in a 1941 episode of the soap with Rev Ruthledge's blessing, but not before a series of complications arose, such as the return of Ned's parents, Frances and Paul Holden (a storyline which resulted in Frances shooting Paul dead when he made his plans to extort money from Ned known) and Ned's marriage to and subsequent divorce from lounge singer Torchy Reynolds (who later ended up in a relationship with Ellis Smith). Storylines in this era also touched on topics rarely discussed up to that point  for example, the character of Rose Kransky had radio's first out-of-wedlock baby. During the radio years, succeeding preachers carried on the work Rev. Ruthledge had started, thus becoming keepers of the \\"guiding light.\\" The show's setting moved to another fictional suburb in 1947, Selby Flats, in the Los Angeles, California area. The Bauers became central to the storyline in 1948.

From June 30, 1952 to June 29, 1956, The Guiding Light ran on both CBS television and radio, with the actors performing, the same scenes but for different audiences, live twice each weekday. The live television performances were in the morning, and then in the afternoon the actors read for the live radio show. On July 2, 1956, The Guiding Light became a CBS television show, only, and the show no longer was heard on radio. Episodes continued at 15 minutes in length. In 1953, CBS strongly persuaded Irna Phillips to let The Guiding Light experiment with television's first color broadcast. Phillips was not thrilled with the concept of color television, and thwarted the effort by CBS by having that day's episode take place entirely in a hospital setting with gray walls and white uniforms. The Guiding Light was broadcast in black and white for the remainder of the decade. In 1956, Phillips created As the World Turns, which first started airing on April 2, 1956 on CBS. When the workload of writing both that show and The Guiding Light became too much for her, Phillips handed the reins at The Guiding Light to her prot√©g√© Agnes Nixon. There is some indication that Procter & Gamble and CBS may have forced Phillips out of writing for The Guiding Light when on the March 31, 1958 episode, popular heroine Katherine \\"Kathy\\" Roberts Lang Grant Holden (played by the equally popular Susan Douglas Rube≈°) was killed off in a Phillips-created story. Kathy, confined to a wheelchair, was killed after being struck by a car. CBS was deluged with protest letters.

The Bauers, living in the fictional suburb of Los Angeles, Selby Flats, were headed by a wise patriarch, Friedrich \\"Papa\\" Bauer, the father of three children, William \\"Bill\\" Edward (originally a pharmacist), Meta, and Gertrude \\"Trudy\\". Papa Bauer, who immigrated to this country from Germany with little more than a dream, and was a hard worker who was full of wisdom. He imparted his wisdom to his children in a folksy tone, commonly interweaving German words. The original primary focus of the Bauer story line was on Meta, who at one point earlier in the 1940s had left the Bauer household to pursue a career in modeling under the alias Jan Carter Meta as Jan had gotten involved, romantically, with the British Theodore \\"Ted\\" White, who headed for his father the California advertising agency that handled Jan's modeling career. Jan found herself pregnant with Ted's child and decided to get her son up for adoption to Ray Brandon and his wife, the former, Charlotte Wilson. Around the time Jan found out that Ray and Charlotte were the adoptive parents of her son, Charles \\"Chuckie\\", Ted reentered her life and she married him, so she could sue Ray and Charlotte for custody, despite the advice of her friends, pediatrician and the married Dr. Ross Boling and Dr. Mary Leland (Ross' wife) not to do so. Jan and Ted did win custody of Chuckie, but at the time they did Mary told Jan (who revealed her true identity as Meta) that her mother \\"Mama\\" Bauer was ill with cancer and soon died and Papa was continuing to ask for her and to make amends to Meta for what had happened to drive Meta out of the household. Meanwhile, Bill had married a woman who was striving for material success and thought Bill should as well, Bertha \\"Bert\\" Miller, who convinced Bill to give up his job working at the pharmacy to go into the work he had trained for, advertising. Meta, still as Jan to him, convinced Ted to hire Bill at his father's advertising agency. Ted did so, but later became mad at Meta for covering up who she really was. Meta and Papa did make amends, although Trudy was jealous of her older sister and her lifestyle and was in love with the married Dr. Ross Boling. Ted then started turning violent to her and Chuckie, and Meta sued for divorce and then Ted and Meta ended up in a custody battle over Chuckie which Meta won, but Ted was granted some lenient time of visitation and to take Chuckie on outings of his own. That's when Ted left the now, five-year-old, Chuckie to die in a freak boxing accident. Meta then left her house and then the Bauers in a daze and ended up in front of Ted's house and shot him dead. In 1950, on the radio version at one point listeners got the chance to choose whether or not to find Meta guilty of murdering her ex-husband Ted White. Ray, on Charlotte's urging, who defended Meta despite the previous custody battle, must have been convincing because the radio audience had Meta acquitted due to temporary insanity. Ray and Charlotte Brandon and Dr. Ross Boling and Dr. Mary Leland faded into obscurity shortly after this, with the only mention of the Brandon's being with Bill and Bert bought their house in the Hollywood Hills. Meta and Trudy later became best friends, with Trudy later marrying the well-off Clyde Palmer and they moved to New York City. The conflicts between the Bauer clan and Bill's headstrong wife Bert were an integral part of the plot in the television show's first decade. Although Bert and her sister-in-law Meta eventually became very close, initially there was a considerable amount of hostility between them. An additional plot-line in this period focused on Bill Bauer's alcoholism and his career difficulties, which were exacerbated by Bert's materialistic nature: she wanted to live much more extravagantly than Bill's salary allowed. Enter to all of this, in 1951, were two people who were going to cause this marriage much turmoil for the next four years of Bill and Bert's marriage. After Ted White's death, Bill had to seek employment with another advertising agency and worked with show business manager, Sid Harper, who was trying to get a singer named Gloria LaRue to sign with him and sought Bill's help. What neither one of the men knew was that Gloria was also an alcoholic and she and Bill started an affair. Gloria nearly had Bill divorce Bert, but Bert refused to let him go and then Bert discovered she was pregnant. When Bill discovered that Bert was pregnant, he agreed to stay with her. Gloria then fell off the wagon, and Sid offered her a new radio and television career which gave her the strength to get sober. Gloria and Sid were then married, and with Bill back with Bert and her expecting their first child, things seemed to stabilize for the Bauers. Bert gave birth to a boy named Michael (later named, \\"Mike\\", and named after Charita Bauer's first son who was also named Michael.) Later in 1952, Bill kept a secret from Bert when he was instrumental in signing Gloria LaRue Harper and new television contract. Soon both Bert and Sid had to watch in anger as Gloria became more emotionally dependent on Bill for her new career. However, Gloria developed vocal problems and had to abandon her new show and she and Sid moved to New York City. Things might have been fine after this, but in 1953, a new wrinkle was added to this problem via Meta's new stepdaughter and her former roommate. During Meta's murder trial, she acquired a champion for her cause to be acquitted, via City Times newspaper reporter Joseph \\"Joe\\" Roberts, Sr. who wrote a series of articles that helped Meta get acquitted. They quickly fell in love and it was found out that Joe had two children from a previous marriage, Katherine \\"Kathy\\" Roberts, an older teenager who was the oldest, and Joseph \\"Joey\\" Roberts, Jr., who was a pre-teen. Kathy and Joey's mother, and Joe's first wife, had died a few years earlier. A nanny, who was also a nurse, named Peggy Ashley Regan had been hired to look after the family, and Kathy and Joey had become quite fond of Peggy. But then Meta started hanging around Joe and the household, as Joe started dating Meta, and Joey liked Meta, but Kathy definitely did not. That's how innocent the problems Kathy was about to face started, and was reminiscent to Meta in many ways to what she had just faced in going to trial for shooting and killing Ted White. Joe wanted to marry Meta, but Meta kept putting him off, feeling that if both of his children were not comfortable with her being their new stepmother (i.e., Kathy), she was unwilling to proceed with a marriage. Meta even tried to escape to New York City and to her sister Trudy and her husband Clyde, to sort out her feelings, and she even started to become involved with one of Clyde's friends, Dr. Bruce Banning, who wanted to marry Meta. But Joe followed Meta there and wore down her defenses and finally she and Joe married, but they decided to keep the marriage a secret to everyone (Bill, Bert, Papa, Kathy and Joey) with only Trudy her bridesmaid and Clyde the best man knowing about this union. Meta, although thrilled to be married to Joe, who she truly loved, knew that they were in for some troubles with Kathy and Joe agreed that when they returned to Selby Flats that Meta was to live separately from Joe and his children, until they could win over Kathy. But once back in the Los Angeles area, Meta continued to struggle to get along with Kathy. Unknown to everyone else, including Meta and Joe, Kathy was having her own romantic difficulties. Kathy first became involved with a garage automobile mechanic several years older than her named, Bob Lang. Bob Lang tried his best to take Kathy to bed with him, but the teenaged Kathy wisely continued to feel that might not be for the best, but Kathy's defenses were weakening where Bob was concerned. Then Kathy suffered an illness for a few days and was taken to Cedars Hospital and that's where she met the eligible bachelor and first cousin to Peggy Ashley Regan, Dr. Richard \\"Dick\\" Grant, Jr. who had just moved from San Francisco. (Peggy was the niece of Dick's mother, Laura Ashley Grant, who was married to Dick's father, Richard Grant, Sr.) Dick was everything Kathy dreamed about when it came to a man, but although Meta and Joe approved of Dick, and Richard approved Kathy, the rich snobby Laura did not. Dick even proposed marriage to Kathy, but seeing how Laura disapproved her, she turned him down. Meta and Joe were still not be forthcoming about their marriage, until Kathy overheard them talking one day and found out about the whole marriage. Kathy was livid that her father betrayed her and Joey and their feelings regarding Peggy and wound up moving out of Joe's house and getting an apartment with a model that worked for Bill's advertising agency, Alice Graham. Then Kathy decided to accept Bob Lang's marriage proposal only telling Alice and Dick that she was marrying the man. Dick was not thrilled about this union, and when Kathy ended up getting pregnant with Bob's child, neither was she. For Bob, in marriage, became abusive and Kathy was his main target for the abuse. Finally having enough of the abuse, in the spring of 1952, Kathy moved out of the house she shared with Bob, and moved back in with Alice, who wasn't too thrilled to have a mother- to-be, as her roommate. Dick tried to get Kathy to divorce Bob, but she refused. But unknown to Kathy, Joe found out about his daughter being pregnant and then had her and Bob's marriage annulled. But in the summer of 1952, Bob was very unhappy about the marriage being ended and tried to force Kathy back into their sham of a marriage, but Kathy refused. So Bob tried to woo her, by becoming as romantic as he could, but Kathy still didn't budge, but agreed to see Bob, even while she was dating Dick. Caught in the middle of all of this was both Alice Graham and Meta Bauer White Roberts. Alice was caught in the middle, because she was the only one who knew that the pregnant Kathy was seeing both Bob and Dick, and Meta was caught in the middle, because Meta could wisely see that Kathy's actions were a direct result of Meta and Joe's marriage, so Meta ran off again to New York City and Trudy and Clyde. Then on September 12, 1952, a tragedy occurred that was to set the stage for Kathy to face a similar legal troubles as Meta had two years earlier. Kathy agreed to go for a driving date with Bob Lang, and during this date, Bob's car ended up having brake trouble. Bob got Kathy to leave the car shortly before it ended up going off a cliff near the Hollywood Hills, but Bob Lang ended up going, with the car, off the cliff to his death. Kathy was beside herself and had no idea what to do, but realized she needed to get away from the accident. Now a very much pregnant Kathy was not sure what to do or whom to turn to. Dick, going against Laura's wishes, agreed to marry Kathy, not only for the sake of her unborn child, but also to keep her from possibly getting into legal trouble over Bob Lang's death. Kathy realized she left one of her gloves in the crime scene, Bob Lang's car, the night he went over the cliff and the police found it. Then to top it all off, Kathy's new uncle and aunt, by marriage, Bert and Bill Bauer were dragged into the whole mess, when Alice Graham (Kathy's now former roommate) ended up being in breach of contract when she signed a deal to do television commercials without telling Bill's advertising agency. Then when Bill tried to force Alice to do the right thing and disavow the commercials, which Alice was unwilling to do, Alice spilled all the beans to Bill as to what and how much trouble Kathy was in including about Bob Lang's death and she was going to the police with the information, which would make Bill an accomplice after-the-fact to Kathy's \\"crimes\\". Meta, reading all about this in New York City, agreed, it was time for her to come back home, but the first few months of 1953 were going to be anything but comfortable for the Bauers or the Roberts or even the Grants. Kathy of course was put on trial for the murder of Bob Lang, with the District Attorney, Richard Hanley out for blood. The articles in the newspapers, both in the City Times (which had to be done, despite Joe pleading to his boss his editor not to do so) and the Times competition, had the effect of causing problems in the marriage of not only Joe and Meta (who finally had to reveal they were married to everyone), but also the marriage of Bill and Bert (with the latest episode with Alice Graham reminding Bert way too much of Bill's problems with Gloria La Rue Harper. Alice backed off her naming Bill as Kathy's accomplice, but she still testified at Kathy's trial and her testimony was nearly damaging enough to send a pregnant Kathy to prison), and the marriages of Kathy and Dick and Laura and Richard, with Richard trying to be lenient to the young couple, but Laura trying to take pound-of-flesh against Kathy at every chance she could. Bill was fired by the advertising agency due to all of this, and had to deal with a demanding Bert trying to get him to get another job, soon. Kathy was acquitted, by the end of March 1953, when Joe discovered that another mechanic who had claimed he had repaired Bob Lang's car's brakes, had really not done so, so it wasn't actually Kathy who caused Bob's tragic and fatal car accident. Shortly after this Meta, Joe and Joey faded into supporting roles, as Kathy and Dick's romantic difficulties started to take center stage on the show, with some story still given to Bill and Bert and their young child, Michael \\"Mike\\". However, Joe died in his sleep, peacefully, on Christmas Eve 1955, and she had to begin again. Joe's funeral was the last time that Joey Roberts appeared. Joey, who had never had problems with Meta and Joe's marriage, had since become a successful member of the Air Force had moved away to Arizona with his wife, Lois. Joe's death, finally showed Meta that she and Kathy were finally the mother-and-daughter team that Meta had hoped for from the beginning as both women consoled each other over the man both of them loved. Bill soon found another job at an advertising agency, but it required many hours and days away from his family and Selby Flats (although Bert was thrilled when they were able to afford to buy the Hollywood Hills home formerly occupied by Ray and Charlotte Brandon, and Papa moved out of Selby Flats and in with them.) Bert started relying more on Papa's sage advice and actually started feeling as his daughter as Papa had said for years she was to him. A young, slightly SORASed Michael though was another issue. With Bill spending so much time alone, Michael started feeling as though he was abandoned by his father. He even started telling Bert and Papa that he had no father and that he had died, which greatly hurt and confused the two of them. Bert took Michael to a child psychologist, despite Papa saying he had enough of advice to help, but the psychologist could do nothing but agree with Papa that Michael was headed for many problems down the road, unless Bill spent more time with him, soon. Bill finally on persuasion of Papa and Bert, took Michael on one of his advertising agency trips and in the hotel Bill made a game out of Michael trying to find his father, which Michael did and soon he and Bill bonded and became best of pals and Michael never spoke of his father being dead, again. (Well, at least not until the summer of 1969.) On New Year's Eve 1954, Bert gave birth to her and Bill's second son, named, William Edward or at the time \\"Billy\\" for short (later in the 1960s, as he aged, he'd refer to himself as Edward or \\"Ed\\" for short.) Coming from Arizona to help out was Bert's recently widowed mother, Elsie Miller, who Michael took an instant disliking too and acted up around, but Michael had every reason to do so, because Elsie herself started to turn the Bauer household upside down. Even Bill and Papa started to dislike her and her demands. And eventually even Bert became fed up with her own mother. Elsie was soon taken care of when the new man in her life, that she was actually escaping, Albert Franklin, came for a visit and quickly broke down her defenses and she and Albert soon married and left the Hollywood Hills home for Arizona. For a time, peace reigned in the Bauer household, but not for long, as Michael who was soon to go by the name of Mike was to face SORASing yet, again, and quickly become a teenager by the end of 1957. Meanwhile, Kathy's marriage to Dr. Dick Grant took some rather interesting twist and turns. Kathy gave birth to Bob Lang's child, whom she named Robin, for the spring time that she was born into. It wasn't an easy childbirth, with Kathy needing to be hospitalized both before, during and afterwards. Dick agreed to adopt Robin, despite his mother's protest, but Kathy faced an internal infection that caused her to hallucinate that many people were out to get her, and actually one was out to get something of hers, her new second husband, Dr. Dick Grant. Hired by Laura to look after and care for Kathy, was private nurse Janet Johnson, who took an instant shine to Dick and she was encouraged to go after him and break up his marriage by Laura herself. And Dick, waiting for Kathy to get better, nearly succumbed to the charms of Janet Johnson. Kathy's health improved, and so did the marriage of Dick and Kathy Grant, that is until Dick faced personal and professional crises at work, where he was overworked at Cedars and had to face a father and son team of doctors, who didn't realize for a while were father and son, that caused Dick to want to give up both his marriage to Kathy and also his profession as a world class surgeon. Soon, Dick left Cedars (during a middle of an operation) and then left Los Angeles and moved to New York City, where for a while he lived under an assumed name and met a young woman who became his new love interest, artist Marie Wallace. Laura, finally agreeing Kathy was not as bad as she had once seemed, rallied with both Kathy and Richard to try and figure out a way to get Dick back home, but none of them knew where he was and eventually Kathy sought a divorce due to abandonment of affection from Dick. Soon after this, Laura and Richard Grant were not seen again, in storyline or on air. Dick soon showed up in Los Angeles, and then Marie also did, and it was soon realized by all that they truly loved each other when Marie went temporarily blind, and Dick was the one who helped Marie regain her eyesight. By this time, it was 1957, and a new wrinkle entered the lives of the newlyweds Dick and Marie Grant. Cedars hired yet a new surgeon named, Dr. Paul Fletcher, and despite Dick and Marie's new marriage, Paul and Marie instantly hit it off, much to Dick's chagrin. Marie was also feeling less than a woman, when it was learned she couldn't get pregnant, and adoptions were not easy to move along enough to satisfy Marie's maternal instincts. Marie nearly had an affair with Dr. Paul Fletcher, but not all was as it seemed for his rival. Dr. Paul Fletcher was actually his assumed name that he adopted during the Korean War, based on what his mother Marion Winters Lipsey had told him about his biological father, Fred Fletcher, who had abandoned him and his mother many years earlier (or that's what he thought.) Paul had thought up to that point that the man who adopted him, his mom Marion Winters' husband, John Lipsey had done so because Fred had abandoned him and his mom, but as it turned out Marion left Fred. Paul did get to finally meet and forgive Fred a few short months before Fred died of cancer in April 1958, but for a time Paul felt he was less deserving of love than others. (Bert Bauer nicknamed Paul a \\"sour apple\\" due to Paul feeling this way during the first two years she knew him, 1956 to 1958.) Another woman soon entered Dr. Paul Fletcher's life, Anne Benedict from San Francisco, who soon became the love of his life and made him realize that he did deserve love. And the change in Paul even made Bert realize his personality wasn't bad as she first thought it was. Anne and Paul soon married, despite for a while Anne's rich father Henry disapproving. Anne Fletcher gave birth to Dr. Paul Fletcher's son, that they named Johnny, which sealed Henry, as well as his wife Helene approving of their daughter's marriage to Paul. In 1959, Dick and Marie Grant were caught up in criminal Joe Turino's illegal adoption scam ring, although quite innocently for them. One of Dick's patients was a run away drug addict by the name of Amy Sinclair, who gave birth in the spring of 1959 to a daughter she named Nora. Feeling as though she couldn't raise Nora on her own, she agreed to let Dick and Marie Grant adopt little Nora who they renamed Marie, but this adoption was set up through Joe Turino's scam ring. In 1960, the district attorney's investigation into this scam led Dick and Marie Grant heartbroken, when they lost custody of Marie and she was returned to Amy. (Dick gave Amy money to hide from Joe Turino and skip town in the process.) Later in the fall of 1960, Dick and Marie Grant tried again to adopt, and succeeded, adopting a boy by the name of Phillip Collins. Dick and Marie Grant left town with their adopted son, Phillip Collins Grant, in 1962, and were not heard from again. After Joe Robert's funeral, Meta, started seeing a man named Mark Holden, who was a rich well-off structural engineer friend of her brother-in-law, Clyde Palmer, hired at Cedars to do some work on the building. Bert tried to set up Meta with Mark, who took a shine to Meta's stepdaughter, Kathy. Meta agreed to step aside for Mark and Kathy, on the advice of Dr. Bruce Banning, who continued to have romantic feelings for Meta. Kathy soon married her third and final husband Mark Holden. It didn't take long for Kathy to find out that the old adage of \\"the apple doesn't fall far from the tree\\" was very true when it came to her daughter with Bob Lang, Robin's personality, was concerned. By the time Kathy married Mark, Robin had also been SORASed into a pre-teen and she acted every bit the brat around Mark, at first. Kathy and Mark couldn't understand why, until she told him that she wanted Kathy to still be married to Dr. Dick Grant. That time, once both Meta and Dick had talk with the young girl, Robin turned around and agreed to accept Mark, just in time for Mark to agree to adopt Robin and Dick allowing that. Meanwhile, Mark's younger sister, a rebellious 16-year-old, Alice Holden showed up in Selby Flats to live with Kathy, Mark and Robin. Right away it was clear that Alice and Robin mixed like water and oil, nearly not at all. Alice was resentful how spoiled Robin appeared to be, and Robin couldn't stand having the older more worldly-wise Alice living in the same household. Enter into all of this a just turned teenaged Mike Bauer, the \\"cousin\\" of Robin, who Robin had a crush on and Mike did allow her some flirtations. But for the 13-year-old Mike, his hormones made him fall under the spell of the older Alice. And Alice picked up on that. This stalemate of constant tension between Robin, Mike and Alice was going to soon lead to a tragedy that compounded for the helpless Kathy. And all of this started just as Kathy found out she was pregnant, again, this time with Mark's child. One day to get back at Robin and to treat her as the spoiled brat she was, Alice took a kitchen chairchairman that Mike, being the young gentlemen he was, usually pulled out for Robin and decided to screw out some of the bolts used to hold the chair together, so it fell apart when Robin sat in it‚Äîso Robin would be embarrassed and perhaps keep her spoiled bratty mouth shut. At that exact time, a pregnant Kathy decided to use that chair to do some work in one of the kitchen cabinets and when Kathy stood on the chair, sure enough as Alice had intended (but for the wrong victim), the chair gave way and Kathy fell hard on to the kitchen floor. Kathy was taken to Cedars and it was clear the injury Kathy sustained was serious and she miscarried her and Mark's child. Kathy then developed another infection and soon found herself permanently restricted to a wheelchair as she developed paralysis. Alice was soon sent packing back to Mark's parents home, and then a year later to a school whose living arrangements were closer to where Mark lived with Robin. In March 1958, Kathy was killed when bicycling children accidentally pushed her wheelchair into oncoming traffic. Mark had to raise the now SORASed to a teenager Robin on his own. Robin and Mike as teenagers soon became more seriously romantically involved. But Robin also became a terribly troublesome to Mark and Meta, trying to break up Meta's romance with Bruce and get her to marry Mark so Meta would become her stepmother. Robin also took an instant disliking to Mark's new romantic involvement with housekeeper Ruth Jannings, a widow herself. On New Year's Eve 1959, Robin found out very harshly she couldn't control everything when she came to Mark's hotel only to discover there was a new Mrs. Mark Holden, and they were on their honeymoon. It only worsened for Robin when she went to Mark's hotel room and when the door opened to the hotel room the new Mrs. Mark Holden answered and it was revealed to be the former Mrs. Ruth Jannings. But Robin was soon to cause more trouble, in the New Year and first year of the new decade, 1960, by getting involved romantically, more, with Mike Bauer, but also Ruth's son, Karl.

Birthhouse of Sinodi-Popov in Taganrog. Dmitri Sinodi-Popov was born in the city of Taganrog, where he received a good education at home: violin, French, Italian and Greek languages and was very good at the visual arts. In 1870, Sinodi-Popov entered the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, where the amateur artist acquired good practical skills, but he had to interrupt his studies because he was suffering from epilepsy. In late 1870s, the artist returned to his home city of Taganrog, continued his art studies and painted a lot. Most of the sketches available at the Taganrog Museum of Art and Taganrog State Museum date back to late 1870s - early 1900s. Most of the visual heritage left by the artist is in the form of drawings. His portraits of local Greeks are very expressive: Portrait of Doctor Divaris, Greek Boy and An Old Greek (1870). Starting from the 1880s, the artist worked in the context of Peredvizhniki traditions. The portrait of the artist Seraphima Blonskaya goes beyond the boundaries of its genre and transforms into a portrait-painting. The image of the young woman conveys seriousness and simplicity.

One story, which involved Bert's battle with uterine cancer gave many female viewers the incentive to see their gynecologists. In 1965, Nixon left the show to become the headwriter of NBC's Another World, at the behest of her mentor, Irna Phillips, who created both GL and AW.'' On March 13, 1967, the show was first broadcast in color. On September 9, 1968, the show expanded from 15 to 30 minutes as did CBS' then other 15 minute daytime drama, Search for Tomorrow. Following the industry trend, the show also switched from broadcasting live to pre-taping in 1968.

The decade began with Meta Roberts marrying Bruce Banning, by the mid-1960s, the focus of the show slowly moved to Bill and Bert's children, Mike and Ed. Their lives and loves provided high drama for many years. Other popular characters of the time included Robin Lang Holden. By winter 1960, Mike and Robin were Seniors in high school and were growing more closely romantically. The only thing standing in their way to that continued romance was Robin's stepbrother, Karl Jannings, also a Senior in high school, who himself had romantic feelings for Robin. But Robin's romantic feelings were definitely aimed at her \\"cousin\\", Mike Bauer. In spring 1960, Mike proposed marriage to Robin and they got engaged. When Karl found out about this he went and told his mother Ruth and stepfather Mark Holdin, who quickly went to both Bill and Bert Bauer, as well as Meta and Bruce Banning who were all livid at the thought that Mike and Robin would marry well they were still in high school. Bert was the worse, and complained to Meta about how Robin was ending up like Kathy was at the same age, and Bert became like the Gestapo spying on Mike's every move. Mike and Robin having enough of Bert and the adults around them decided to elope in May 1960. Karl also found out about this and with the backing of Ruth got into fights with Mike, and Bert and Bill didn't know what to do, but had to take the young newlyweds into their home with Bert continuing her Gestapo-like policies on to the couple much to the chagrin of Papa Bauer. Tragedy soon struck with the fights between Mike and Karl escalating. On the July 4th holiday 1960, hosted by Meta and Bruce at their penthouse apartment, a drunk Karl picked a fight with Mike on Meta and Bruce's patio where in his defense he shoved Karl really hard with Karl landing head first onto one of Meta and Bruce's patio tables! For a couple of minutes Karl laid there not moving with the back of his head all bloody with no one sure what had happened, Bruce and Dr. Dick Grant checked Karl out and it turned out he was in a coma. Ruth Holden was beside herself, and when the police came, not sure of all the facts, yet, but Mike admitting he had shoved Karl, Mike was arrested for attempted murder. Robin and the Bauers stood by Mike as he went to trial for murdering Karl, after Karl died of his injuries at Cedars hospital. Ruth started to admit that Mike might not have been at fault as Dr. Dick Grant pointed out how much alcohol Karl had consumed that night. Fortunately before the end of the year 1960, Mike was charged and later acquitted of the death of Karl Jannings, when it was proved by his uncle Bruce and Dr. Dick Grant that Karl was way to drunk that night for Mike to have caused most of the damage that killed the young man. Once he was cleared of the death, Mike and Robin's marriage was annulled, by Bert. Mike still felt guilty for letting the tension between him and Karl escalate so much that Karl ended up dead even if he wasn't at fault. So, in January 1961, Mike decided to leave Bill and Bert and move to New York City and to his aunt Trudy and uncle Clyde and attend Columbia University as a pre-law student. Bill, Bert and Papa were happy for Mike, but just as with Robin sad to see him go. In the summer of 1961, Bill and Bert received a letter from Mike stating that he was taking a hiatus from his pre-law studies and moving to Venezuela to work on an oil rig which he would do so until January 1962 when he moved back to the Hollywood Hills home of his parents. Meanwhile, in November 1960, Robin met Alex Bowden an art dealer and art museum owner. After Mike left, Robin married Alex Bowden which surprised many people around her, as Alex had the personality of Svengali. Later after Robin learned how much Alex was as bad as everyone said, and after losing their child in miscarriage she divorced him. Dr. Paul Fletcher struggled to run a free clinic in a run- down area of Los Angeles' near the suburb of Selby Flats. Anne his wife, and later Paul's sister nurse Jane Fletcher, objected, especially when Alex Bowden's estranged first wife, the alcoholic Doris Crandall, who got involved temporarily with criminal Joe Turino, showed up in town and became one of Paul's patients. Things came to ahead one evening, in October 1962, when Doris got a hold of a gun, that Turino had given her for protection, and threatened to commit suicide inside the Fletcher's garage. Anne misinterpreted the whole situation and got into a struggle with Doris for control of the gun and it misfired and Anne was shot and killed with her and Paul's son, Johnny, witnessing the whole tragic event. This set Johnny into becoming a spoiled kid, with Anne's father, Henry, spoiling him the most‚Äîsending him money setting up a well-funded trust fund for when he became 18 years old, something that Paul would object to for years. Paul's sister Jane also started doting on Johnny to the point that Auntie Jane also started spoiling him. Joe Turino left for parts unknown shortly after Anne's death, and Doris Crandall left and returned to San Francisco. Mike, after returning from Venezuela and dealing with Bert having uterine cancer (discovered by Paul Fletcher) and having an operation, got a job as a legal assistant to attorney George Hayes. While finishing law school, Mike first fell for Paul's sister, Jane Fletcher and then Jane's roommate‚Äîwho was also George's secretary, Julie Conrad. Bert loved Jane and became friends with her, but Bert found Julie to be nothing but a money grubbing floozy. Julie did taunt Mike with sexual suggestions and flirting, and Mike was willing, until a scorned Jane found out and tried to give both of them a hard time by telling all to Bert. Julie then moved out from Jane and then took the very willing Mike to her bed. When Julie wouldn't go to bed with him a second time, Mike forced himself on Julie, and then Julie ended up pregnant! Bert found out about the pregnancy and forced Mike and Julie into an old-fashioned shotgun wedding! And to top it all off, Bert forced Mike and Julie to live with her, Bill, Ed and Papa! Bert restarted her Gestapo type spying on Mike and Julie that she had used on Mike and Robin, earlier. And Mike, with a child on the way and a mother who was becoming increasingly overbearing (to the chagrin of both Papa and Bill), had a difficult time getting through law school studies. After her difficult pregnancy and then delivery of Hope, Mike's daughter, Julie started a downhill spiral into mental instability, especially when she couldn't get pregnant, again, after suffering a miscarriage of what would have been Mike's second child. As Julie became distant to Hope, Bert doted on Hope and acted as a surrogate mother to the young girl (a role she would take on as Hope got older, as well.) Mike didn't know what to do, but started to agree with Bert, Papa and Bill that Julie was not in the best of shape emotionally and eventually agreed she needed to be sent to a mental institution. Robin left town after divorcing Alex Bowden, and Alex left and returned to Doris Crandall in San Francisco. Robin then became involved with Dr. Paul Fletcher, but Paul's sister Jane was opposed to this union and decided to use Johnny to guilt Paul and Robin into not getting married. Jane after causing problems for Robin and Paul and keeping them apart as long as she could and by giving into young Johnny's demands to be treated special, reformed, and married George Hayes after George suffered severe injuries when saving Jane from getting hit by a car. Robin Lang Holden Bowden and Paul Fletcher then married, and Robin soon found herself pregnant with Paul's child. Around that same time, in a bit of \\"retroactive continuity\\", the show's writers changed the name and location of the series' locale from Selby Flats, which had been described as a suburb of Los Angeles, to Springfield, U.S.A.‚Äîno state designated, but apparently in the Midwest. Cedars Hospital (so named to suggest the real Cedars of Lebanon Hospital‚Äînow Cedars Sinai‚Äîin Los Angeles), introduced in Selby Flats on radio in 1947, remained a central location in Springfield. Springfield as a new locale was first introduced, in the summer of 1965, via Bill Bauer opening a new office of a New York City advertising agency, Carson & Associates, in Springfield, with Bill actually being the only associate. His secretary, at the new agency, Maggie Scott was a widow (or so she thought at that time) whose husband Ben had supposedly been killed in the Korean War. Maggie was raising her and Ben's teenage daughter, Peggy, and Maggie was romantically involved with the young Jason Weber, who started working with Bill at the agency. (This change of locale from Selby Flats to Springfield was clearly intended as a transition and not a move by all of the characters due to later 1966 script writing that aired. For example, Peggy would in dialogue tell others she enjoyed working with Dr. Paul Fletcher at his free clinic in the summer of 1965, although the clinic never did really move locations. And Papa Bauer would tell others he had lived in Springfield all his life that he lived in the United States, even though earlier radio and television episodes would not have been in support of Papa's assertions on that matter.) Mike Bauer was written off the show after becoming estranged from Bert's overbearing presence in his marriage to Julie and finally graduating law school and passing The Bar in the spring of 1965. Julie became mentally unstable and later committed suicide, in January 1966, in a mental facility just outside the town of Oakdale. (In later conversations, Mike is said to have worked in Oakdale and helped the characters of attorney Mitchell Dru, as well as lawyers Chris and Donald Hughes on some cases, but there seems to be very little evidence that the character of Mike ever appeared on As the World Turns.) In 1966, Mike and his daughter Hope moved to Bay City and the characters crossed over to Another World. Mike and Hope would return to The Guiding Light and its new locale of Springfield in 1968. While in Bay City, Mike got involved romantically and engaged to his boss, attorney John Randolph's daughter, Lee Carter Randolph. Lee Carter Randolph was the daughter of John and his deceased first wife, Lee Dwyer Randolph. Mike met John's second wife, the former Patricia \\"Pat\\" Matthews and Lee's stepmother who Lee already was not thrilled about. Mike and Pat found themselves falling in love with each other, despite trying to resist the attraction for John and Lee's sake, but one day they ended up kissing which Lee witnessed. And although Lee didn't tell her father, she became more estranged from Pat and then estranged from her father John who could not fathom the reason as to why. Mike after a confrontation with Lee, where Lee returned her engagement ring, left Bay City with Hope in February 1967. During the year 1967‚Äì1968, when the characters were not either on Another World or The Guiding Light, Mike and Hope would be listed, later, as working, going to school and living in Philadelphia. Mike's time and romantic entanglements, with Lee Carter Randolph and her stepmother Pat Matthews Randolph, in Bay City would not be without consequences in Bay City. Lee would end up getting involved, later, with mechanic, later turned attorney, Samuel \\"Sam\\" Lucas, who Lee's father John and her stepmother Pat objected. too, and they had good reasons. Sam Lucas was dealing drugs during the height of the drugs experimentation by younger people of the late-1960s. One day in 1969, Lee, unaware, would have her coffee laced with LSD by Sam Lucas. This would lead to Lee having her fatal car accident at that time. And much later, in the 1970s, Pat Matthews Randolph would give birth to her and John's son that she would name, Michael, possibly after Mike Bauer. Bill and Bert's younger SORASed son Ed began his residency at Cedars Hospital in Springfield under the tutelage of Dr. Stephen \\"Steve\\" Jackson, Cedars Chief of Surgery. Dr. Ed Bauer had to contend with two other interns at Cedars who were vying to become Steve's new prot√©g√©, Dr. Joseph \\"Joe\\" Werner and Dr. Jim Frazier, with Jim soon becoming a new resident. Furthermore, Bert was upset that her youngest son would be going by the name of Edward or \\"Ed\\", his given middle name, instead of the name she had been calling him since he was first born, \\"Billy\\" for William his first name. Unfortunately this would not be the only thing that Bert would find to be disappointing about her younger son. Meanwhile, Jason Weber started cooling things off with Maggie Scott in January 1966, with Maggie confused as to why. Then Jason, who Maggie realized was hiding something from her in his breaking things off, died in a car accident. Soon after that, Maggie and Bill Bauer started an affair, which Bill soon felt regrets and guilt about as Bert arrived in Springfield. Then in March 1966, Maggie Scott got a big shock, and soon realized why Jason had called off their relationship because Jason knew about this, when her thought to be dead husband, Ben Scott, showed up still very much alive! Apparently Ben had not died in the Korean War, after all, and was hiding out embarrassed that others might have died in his place. Ben then opened a new restaurant in Springfield and served as the restaurant's owner and manager. Soon Ben was ingratiating himself into Maggie and Peggy's life playing the role of the doting father and husband to the hilt. But Maggie, still carrying on her affair with her boss, Bill, started to suspect that Ben had ulterior motives. Soon enough, Maggie, much to her chagrin, would learn that she was right. Maggie was hoping and pleading with Bill to leave Bert and marry her, so she could be done with Ben. But Papa added to Bill's guilt by telling him that it would hurt Bert deeply, if he were to leave her and Bill decided to stay married to Bert and told a very disappointed Maggie that. Ben soon found out about the affair when Bill told Maggie to write a love letter to him, where she would break things off with him, so she might not feel so bad being rejected by him. Unfortunately Ben found this love letter and made a photocopy of it and decided he would blackmail the two of them. Also moving to Springfield from Selby Flats were the married couples of Dr. Paul Fletcher and his wife, Robin Lang Holden Bowden Fletcher and attorney George Hayes and his wife, nurse Jane Fletcher Hayes. Paul and Jane both got high-powered jobs at Cedars Hospital in Springfield and were prominent in story line at the hospital in the mid-1960s. For a while, Meta became a nursing assistant, answering phones, at Cedars, well Bruce became Chief of Staff at Cedars. The romantic troubles, of two young couples, Ed and Steve's daughter, Cedars nurse Leslie Jackson and Maggie and Ben's teenage daughter Peggy and Paul's son (Robin's stepson) Johnny and how the adults dealt with those romantic troubles became center stage in the show's story line in 1966‚Äì1967. Around this time, Meta left with her husband, Dr. Bruce Banning, for Bruce to get a high-powered job at New York City's Presbyterian Hospital as that hospital's Chief of Staff, with Dr. Paul Fletcher becoming Chief of Staff at Cedars. Ben Scott started blackmailing Bill and Maggie and forced Maggie to remarry him and forced her and Peggy to move into a new house and forced Maggie to stop working at Carson & Associates. Ben also forced Bill to remain married to Bert. Ed also found out about Bill and Maggie's affair and told Bill in no uncertain terms to cut it off or else he'd go to Bert and tell her all. Bill soon fell off the wagon and ended up drinking, again, much to Bert's horror. Maggie soon expressed boredom at being relegated to housewife status, but Ben told her he had her hogtied, due to the photocopy of the love letter, and she couldn't do anything else but be the doting mother and wife! Unknown to Ed and Ben, though, Bert found out about the affair anyway! First, in April 1966, Bert had gone to the offices of Carson & Associates and then found out from Bill's other secretary at the time, Carol, that Bill had gone to lunch without her and when she went to the restaurant she got to see Maggie and Bill having lunch together and getting all romantic in front of her. (What Bert didn't know at the time was that was when Bill told Maggie that they had to end the affair due to Ben's blackmailing of the two of them.) Then in July 1966, while Bert was waiting up for Bill to come home, Bill came in and blabbed about it during an alcoholic stupor. Bert decided to stay married to Bill, and expressed to her sister-in-law, before Meta left with Bruce, that she wanted to change her ways and be less demanding of Bill and agreed to stay with Bill through his latest return to the bottle. Bert also confronted Maggie, who had started working as George Hayes' part-time secretary in spite of and to spite Ben, about the affair at George and Jane Hayes' home, and told her to stay married with Ben and make him happy and not restart anything with Bill or 'else'. Meanwhile, the departure of Meta and Bruce, put Papa in a quandary as to where to live. Papa wasn't necessarily as enthused to live in New York City, and give up his efficiency apartment in the same neighborhood as where Paul and Robin lived, with his daughter and son-in-law and expressed this to a drunk Bill. Bill feeling bitter that Papa was nagging him over both the affair with Maggie and his alcoholism actually bitterly told off his father, as he had never done before, and Papa decided to temporarily move with Meta and Bruce to New York City. Unfortunately, when Papa came back to Springfield and again moved into the efficiency apartment and only told Ed this, Ed would go and gloat over this to Bill which set Bill to drinking again. Meanwhile, at the same time, Paul found out about Papa's living situation and was livid and suggested that Papa speak to Bert. And when Bert found out from Ed what he had said to Bill about Papa's living situation she was livid at him. Peggy also got a volunteer job as a part-time candy striper at Cedars. When Peggy overheard Ben and Maggie arguing, she confronted Ben at his restaurant office and Ben lied to her that the argument was about his Will that he had a photocopy of and that argument also had to do with Maggie not wanting to take a family trip to the Canadian Rockies so soon after getting the job with George Hayes. (Maggie later expressed to Peggy she'd reconsider.) Maggie would later express relief at Ben that he made up such a story. Unfortunately for Maggie and Ben, Peggy found out about the affair anyway, when one night she got stuck at Bill's office in an attempt to recover her mother's purse and Social Security card that George Hayes needed for employment papers for Maggie. Bill had stayed late at the office and was, again, in an alcoholic stupor where he started to believe that Peggy was Maggie and ended up blabbing about the affair to Peggy, who was in total shock and disbelief. Peggy turned more towards the continued to be spoiled Johnny for comfort, although Peggy didn't tell Johnny as to the whole reason why. Meanwhile, in the home of Paul and Robin Fletcher, Johnny was becoming a handful for Robin, especially in terms of him not cleaning after himself. Robin liked Peggy, but was resentful, of Maggie, after Peggy learned the truth of Bill and Maggie's affair, that Peggy would spend so much time with Johnny instead of at home. Robin, while pregnant, one day was cleaning Johnny's room when she had an accident and fell off a ladder and lost the child in a miscarriage. Robin then went into a severe depression, and Johnny blamed himself for what happened, although Paul tried to make his son see that it wasn't all his fault. Johnny moved out, and moved in briefly with his Uncle George and Aunt Jane and got a job as an orderly at Cedars, after he went to his grandfather Henry Benedict with how bad things were and despite Paul's disapproval became more spoiled due to Henry's giving Johnny his trust fund money earlier than when Johnny turned 18. Johnny then admitted to Peggy that he had felt resentment towards Robin, but not to the point that he wished her any harm or to what would have been his half-sibling. Johnny tried to turn to his Aunt Jane, but even the once giving in to Johnny's every whim, Jane Fletcher Hayes was dismayed how spoiled her nephew had become‚Äîeven as another well-off daughter, Leslie Jackson was willing to do extra work and make extra money, beyond being a nurse at Cedars, was babysitting her and George Hayes' adopted daughter, Amy. Paul though thought that Peggy was becoming a stabilizing influence on his son, although Ben Scott was not of the same mind. Jane's turning Johnny down for any more help, then made Johnny move out on his aunt and uncle, which totally made Paul think he was losing his son, except for the grace of Peggy. In the later half of 1966, Agnes Nixon started a story that she only gave the genesis of before she left as head writer. Leslie Jackson would discover part of the reason why her father Steve would not talk about her mother, Victoria, that much despite him having a painted portrait of her in his living room (the portrait bore a striking resemblance to Lynne Adams who also played Leslie.) Steve told Leslie that Victoria had left the two of them and Springfield when Leslie was a toddler. But in flashbacks of Steve the audience got more: Victoria (played in the flashbacks by Adams) had enjoyed partying, dressing up and being seen. One night Victoria had embarrassed Steve and he ordered her to get out and stay away. As far as Steve knew Victoria was far away and that's how Steve hoped it would stay. In 1974, later writers of the show would pick-up this story from Nixon and expand on it. But from 1966 to 1974, Leslie believed as Steve told her that her mother, Victoria, was dead. This bit of feeling slightly estranged from Steve, because of her dead mother and Steve's ambivalence about talking to her about her mother, led Leslie to be open to romance to Ed, despite his soon to be turn towards alcoholism. Leslie also had had another would-be suitor at Cedars, by then resident Dr. Joe Werner, who for a while was in competition with Ed to get the most patients. Joe would continue to complain for a while in conversations with Ed and his mutual good friend, Dr. Jim Frazier, but eventually realized Ed was a very capable doctor. Ed though would win Leslie's heart and the two of them would marry in September 1967, with Steve's approval. In January 1967, Dr. Sara McIntyre arrived in Springfield and Cedars. Sara's specialty was psychology and she was known as a psychologist who would soon be called upon to help many of the residents in Springfield through some rather harsh emotional crisis. But Sara also did work in other areas of medicine, including in operations with Dr. Steve Jackson, Dr. Joe Werner and Dr. Ed Bauer. At this time, Joe considered Sara somewhat of usurper when it came to being involved in medicine. As it turned out Joe was actually quite chauvinistic when it came to Sara and woman in medicine, thinking that a woman's place was in the home not in an operating room or anywhere else in a hospital other than as a nurse. Sara though knew how to put Joe in his place and eventually started to win him over that she was just as capable as he was as a doctor. Sara also had a romantic past with Dr. Paul Fletcher. This romantic past between Sara and Paul, caused the already severely depressed Robin Fletcher to sink further into depression. This depression of Robin's would get so severe, that by October 1967, the writers of The Guiding Light recycled a story line and device used to kill off Robin's mother, Kathy, nearly a decade earlier, by having Robin Lang Holden Bowden Fletcher throw herself into oncoming traffic, which was just as unpopular with viewers as it was in 1958 when what happened to Kathy happened. After Ed and Leslie were married all was not happy with this young couple. As Bert started becoming more attentive to Bill and their marriage started to stabilize and Bill started going to AA and getting sober and with both of them getting Papa to move back in with them (although Papa did keep his efficiency apartment when he wanted to give Bill and Bert privacy or get away from them for his own privacy), Ed would begin drinking heavily and then became alcoholic after he discovered the affair between his father and Maggie Scott. Ed became verbally violent not only to Bert and Bill, but also towards Leslie and Papa. Ed became even more confused and more of an alcoholic, when Bert trying to change her old ways of being so demanding defended Bill towards Ed! And that's when Ed started to become emotionally and physically violent towards Leslie. Ben Scott continued to be very opposed and antagonistic towards the budding romance between the now 18-year-old Johnny Fletcher and his daughter, Peggy. Johnny and Peggy obtained a marriage license on Peggy's eighteenth birthday, in April 1967, that Ben found out about and then confronted Johnny and Peggy, about, and died of a heart attack. Peggy then got an annulment, disappointing Johnny. (Peggy's mother Maggie would die nearly a year later, after they became close after the tragedy of Ben's death and Peggy's annulment, in March 1968, from a stomach ailment while on the operating table while a drunk Ed was operating, forcing Peggy to live for a while with Bert.) Paul also forced Henry Benedict to stop funding Johnny and so Johnny lost the funds from Henry. In March 1968, Mike Bauer, with his daughter Hope, moved to Springfield and Mike began working as a partner with his former boss, George Hayes, until George Hayes and Jane Fletcher Hayes stopped appearing and disappeared from story line later that year. Mike immediately was dismayed at Ed's being abusive to Leslie. Leslie found a life line via Mike and then they became romantically attached to each other. Soon Mike and Leslie started an affair, despite Leslie still having romantic feelings for Ed. During this time, Peggy met Marty Dillman, a gang leader, when he was in Cedars after a gang fight and Peggy the nurse want-to-be, found herself falling in love with her patient and then a short-time later they married. Johnny during this time met another woman that he became romantically attached to named Tracey Delmar, who was already causing problems for another resident of Springfield, and would soon be involved with many more via her real name of Charlotte Waring. (Tracey Delmar also flirted with Dr. Ed Bauer, in the spring of 1967 when she first arrived in Springfield, several months before he married Leslie Jackson.) Tracey Delmar was originally introduced as the \\"niece\\" of Dr. Sara McIntyre. But \\"Tracey Delmar\\" wasn't really Sara's niece. But before Sara could find this out, Tracey had already swindled the good doctor McIntyre out of much money. One of the two men who found out, at first, that Tracey was really Charlotte Waring was none other than Marty Dillman, who Tracey started flirting with despite his marriage to Peggy (Charlotte was resentful that Johnny and Peggy were still hanging around each other, at Cedars, as Johnny started to want to become a doctor like his father.) Johnny and Tracey, though, did marry. But then the other man who found out who Tracey really was, garage mechanic Flip Malone, started putting the screws to both Marty and Charlotte and hit them up for his share of the money in the fleecing of Dr. Sara McIntyre. One person who soon recognized who Tracey really was, was Dr. Joe Werner, who had had romantic past with Charlotte. (Joe and Charlotte had dated while he was in medical school.) Joe was able to cue Sara into that \\"Tracey\\" might not be her niece and soon the gig was up for Charlotte. But in the meantime, Charlotte being ousted as not being \\"Tracey\\", would have to contend with both Marty Dillman and Flip Malone being angry that the money was drying up from \\"Tracey\\"'s former \\"aunt\\" Sara. Johnny soon asked \\"Tracey\\" for a divorce, with Mike successfully suing for Johnny for the divorce. Charlotte was now considered the town pariah by many. Soon though, Charlotte would find a way to redeem herself to many. In September 1968, after an alcoholic Ed, got into physical fight with Bill, Ed pushed Bill hard and Bill suffered a heart attack. Bill Bauer soon became a candidate for a Cedars first ever heart transplant. Bill was given only nine years to live after the successful surgery. Sara helped Bert through the difficult emotional turmoil that this transplant caused her. In January 1969, Marty Dillman eventually wound up being murdered and his pregnant wife Peggy was wrongly put on trial for it. (The actual murderer was Flip Malone, but Peggy was the last person who people saw Marty with and it was during a fight where Peggy was very visibly angry at him, because she had discovered how much Marty had been in cahoots with her rival Charlotte.) While in jail, Peggy gave birth to a son she named William Bauer Dillman, or Billy for short, in honor of Bill Bauer. Mike defended and exonerated Peggy of the crime. Peggy ended up being treated as a daughter by Bert and got help through the emotional turmoil via Sara. Peggy and Johnny would also reconcile and get married and Johnny would adopt Billy as his own as he started out as a surgeon at Cedars. Peggy also started as a registered nurse at Cedars at this time. Johnny also started to go by the name of Dr. John Fletcher. Dr. Paul Fletcher was thrilled to see his son, John, get his life straight and go into the profession that Paul also called his own. Despite Dr. Sara McIntyre doing well helping her friends, Bert Bauer and Peggy Scott Dillman through emotional storms, Sara's life post Charlotte trying to fleece her as her \\"niece\\" \\"Tracey\\" was anything but as easy for her to deal with. Dr. Paul Fletcher still expressed interest in Sara, but in the end nothing came of it due to how he still felt about the loss of his wives Anne and Robin. Dr. Joe Werner developed romantic feelings for Sara, but Sara held him off still concerned that Charlotte and Joe might restart their romantic past and also having romantic ideals on relationships that seemed old- fashioned to many that Joe should just never be with another woman then her if he was truly in love with her. Joe even proposed marriage to Sara and agreed to take her on a year-long sabbatical to England, but Sara turned him down and Joe went off to England alone. While Joe was, in England, sorting out his feelings for Sara, he met an attractive widow named Cindy Brown, an American living in London, who suffered from a mysterious illness and was not getting the help she needed in England, and Joe talked her into returning to Springfield with him for treatment. This made Sara very uneasy seeing the two of them together. Soon Joe, realizing Sara would still put him off, started a relationship with Cindy, who recovered from her illness. Joe and Cindy ended up having a brief affair with, and Cindy changed her last name back to her maiden name of Gardner because of the affair with Joe. Charlotte found out about the affair between Joe and Cindy, while at the courthouse during Peggy's trial with Cindy changing her last name legally, and blabbed about it to Sara just to get Joe in trouble with her rival, and so it did and Sara decided to move on to other men. Unfortunately the next man who she turned to nearly was her undoing and also nearly deadly to the good doctor McIntyre. Enter Lee Gantry, a malaria patient at Cedars at this time, who Sara found very attractive as well as charming and erudite. Lee Gantry soon recovered from malaria, and this prompted Sara to find out more about the man. Lee Gantry was also an American who had spent a comparatively large amount of time in England. Sara soon found herself attracted romantically to Lee and once he was cured of malaria she decided to take a trip with him to Great Britain, and on the trip they stayed at his English country estate, where she let herself be charmed even more by Lee Gantry, who the audience was let on to was a man who had a habit of being on the prowl for lonely women such as Sara. It also turned out that Lee had been widowed by a rich English woman named Alice Rawlings that he had married. What Sara didn't realize at that time, in late 1968, was that Lee had already gaslighted his Alice and was actually responsible for her death. Lee was also moving slowly, and incorporating into the architecture of his just outside Springfield farmhouse much of the architectural work of the Alice's English country estate. Enter Miss Mildred Foss. Miss Mildred Foss was Alice Rawlings Gantry's house hold manager and knew of Lee's killing of Alice and so she blackmailed him into rehiring her in Springfield. Sara also met Miss Mildred Foss, who decided this time to work with her boss Lee to gaslight Sara for all of her money. Surprisingly to all in Springfield, although none more than Dr. Joe Werner, Sara soon married Lee and, through, until the end of the decade, sure enough Miss Mildred Foss and Sara's first husband, Lee Gantry, were gaslighting Dr. Sara McIntyre by trying to make her think she was going insane. Lee and Miss Foss first started their gaslighting by changing appointments in Sara's appointment book. They also created noises in Lee's house's attic, that they claimed were squirrels on the roof. Then they started their work on her checkbook. When Lee took Sara on another trip to England, in the summer of 1969, with Miss Foss going with them, Miss Foss set up quite a scare for Sara by not introducing her to the country estate's groundskeeper, Tyler Meade, who could be quite a scary presence with his well built soccer player style form. Sara wasn't sure what to make of Tyler who was peeking into rooms, at the estate house, from outside, but it did make her scared out of her wits for several weeks. (It didn't help matters that Miss Mildred Foss and Tyler Meade were former lovers.) And when Sara got back home to Springfield, things got worse when she consulted another psychiatrist for anxiety and was prescribed medication that Miss Mildred Foss tampered with. Sara soon bought a gun, and Joe was very disconcerted, so much so that he sought out the advice of, and hopefully investigative work of, Springfield police Lieutenant Pete Stassen, who did a preliminary investigation but was convinced nothing was wrong and thought Joe was just being a nuisance, since Lt. Stassen's wife, Judy, had been one of Joe's past lovers. Frustrated by the lack of help from Lt. Pete Stassen, and getting a clue over the phone from his former lover, Cindy Gardner who turned out knew Miss Mildred Foss, Joe went back to England and discovered from one of Cindy and Mildred's shared former lovers, Dusty McGuire, that Miss Foss had previously been fired by Lee Gantry. Something bad was about to happen at Lee Gantry's house, and it would involve Sara. In March 1969, Ed's alcoholism finally caught up to him, when Leslie asked him to move out and gave him an ultimatum to either get sober or get a divorce! Ed ended up moving back in with Bill and Bert, but even a now sober Bill couldn't reason with Ed to go to AA and get sober. Shortly afterward, in April 1969, he was involved in a traffic accident that caused one of Sara's pregnant patients, Margie Wexler, who was driving the car Ed hit, to have a miscarriage and lose her and her husband, Peter Wexler's child. Peter Wexler was an attorney who was working with Mike Bauer in their law practice and had to later, in December 1969, watch as Margie would commit suicide due to the miscarriage and how busy Sara was dealing with Lee Gantry and Miss Mildred Foss. Ed didn't help matters any, by originally leaving the scene of the accident and originally resisting arrest by Springfield police Lt. Wally Campbell and Springfield police Sgt. DeMarco. Mike and Bill would post bail for Ed, but then Mike and Bill got more of a surprise when Ed would end up skipping town telling himself he couldn't face any of his family or his wife any longer. In July 1969, Bill took a plane trip for work to Alaska, and the plane crashed. Bill was then presumed dead. Sara again tried to console emotionally her friend, Bert, who was also dealing with the missing Ed. Mike and Leslie's romantic relationship went into a state of limbo as no one had any clue where Ed had gone, too. Hope, though, was hoping that Leslie would soon be her new stepmother because she really liked Leslie. During this time, Mike Bauer started to hang around Charlotte and in waiting for Leslie to reconcile how she felt about Ed, developed romantic feelings towards Charlotte. Although Charlotte was still considered by many in town the town pariah, Mike was much more lenient towards her, for Charlotte had been the one who would turn over evidence to Mike Bauer that would exonerate Peggy, by seducing Flip Malone. Charlotte, though, was still not over her feelings for Dr. Joe Werner, and Joe over his for Sara. This and Ed being missing, left an impasse over relationships for Mike, Leslie, Charlotte and Joe heading into the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970. To field out how she felt about Joe, Charlotte was able to get a job as vice administrator of Cedars, which made more than a few people very unhappy. Before the end of 1969, Mike proposed marriage to Charlotte, but Hope was still hoping for Leslie to be her new stepmother. Hope told Bert that Charlotte would be bad news for her father, and Bert agreed with her granddaughter about the woman. Also in 1969, the rich businessman Stanley Norris was introduced. Stanley was divorced from his first wife, cookbook writer Barbara. Barbara was left alone to raise their three children, Kenneth (\\"Ken\\"), Andrew (\\"Andy\\") (who was listed as fighting in the Vietnam War), and Holly. Stanley would soon divorce his second wife, Katherine \\"Kit\\" Vestid, a Cedars volunteer, when she found out that he was carrying on affairs with several other women. One of those women was Deborah Herbert Mehren, who was the wife of one of Stanley's employees, Gilbert \\"Gil\\" Mehren. (Gil and Deborah Mehren were the second major African-American married couple seen on The Guiding Light played by David Pendleton and Olivia Cole.) Kit herself ended up having an affair with her stepson, Ken, who was an attorney who eventually went into practice with Mike. Kit also found herself falling for Dr. Joe Werner, despite befriending Charlotte Waring, who was also Kit's boss at Cedars. In September 1969, a sober, going to AA, Ed surfaced in nearby Clayton, working at Hastings Electrical Supply as the company's doctor, and got involved with the company's secretary, Janet Mason, from the nearby town of Tarrywood. Ed didn't know while in Clayton, that Bill had been declared dead in the Alaska plane crash and wouldn't learn of this until December 1969. Janet's father, Colonel Grove Mason, was the manager of Hasting Electrical Supply and therefore Ed and Janet's boss there. At first Grove was not happy to see his daughter involved with Ed. Ellen at first was also not happy with Janet's involvement with Ed, and then Janet also contacted, via phone, a friend of hers in Springfield named Debra Mehren (yes, that Debra Mehren), who told Janet she was aware of Ed and some of his romantic past (as well as his alcoholic past‚Äîalthough she didn't tell Janet that) and warned her cryptically to be on guard about starting a romance with Ed. But although Janet was warned she eventually had her defenses worn down and decided to take the romantic plunge into a deep romance with Ed. Ellen also came around quickly and realized how much of a great young man Ed was, and thought he was perfect for her daughter. Janet and her mother Ellen worked on Grove to change his mind, on the subject, and after a work accident where Ed saved many lives, Grove changed his mind. But Grove would be a bit concerned when he found out why Ed was returning to Springfield in December 1969. (Ed also wanted to find out if his wife Leslie wanted him back, Ed alluded to this to the Masons, but didn't tell them everything before he left.)

Its population in the 2011 census was 261. History Harrington Harbour was founded near the end of the 19th century by fishermen from Newfoundland.Tourism Lower North Shore: Harrington Harbour The primary activity is commercial fishing for crabs, lobster, turbot, halibut, and cod. Harrington Harbour was named after Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Harrington. It is also known locally as \\"Hospital Island\\", from its earlier role as a medical centre for the area. Local tradition claims that this is the island on which 16th century French noblewoman Marguerite de La Rocque was marooned by her relative Jean-Fran√ßois Roberval as punishment for an affair. \\"Marguerite's Cave\\" is one of the attractions on the island. Another attraction is the Jacques Cartier Monument, commemorating the French explorer and surveyor of the Gulf of St Lawrence. Harrington Harbour is a small village on average 300 residents. Harrington Harbour was originally settled by Newfoundland families in search of fish stocks in the second half of the 19th century. Dr. Wilfred Grenfell, founder of the famous medical mission in the region, visited Harrington Harbour starting in the late 19th century. Grenfell built a hospital on the island, earning the village its nickname of Hospital Island. Present day Today, fishing is still the main activity, with a bustling public wharf and fish plant. A heliport is located in the village and wharf facilities located in the village are also used to service the village of Chevery, where a regional airport is located. Models, panels and local artifacts interpret traditional activities, fishing, and local history. The village was the principal filming location for the Quebec film Seducing Doctor Lewis (La Grande s√©duction).

The first half of the decade was mainly dominated by the story lines that were written by the head writing married couple of Robert Soderberg and Edith Sommer who wrote for the show from near the end of 1969 to the spring of 1973 and were long time and reliable soap scribes. And then the head writing team that replaced Soderberg and Sommer, James Gentile, Robert Cenedella and former The Guiding Light cast member James Lipton continued most of the stories in the same direction as started by Soderberg and Sommer from the spring of 1973 to near the end of October 1975. Under Soderberg and Sommer, several memorable story lines either concluded in big ways or kept many viewers very riveted to the action in Springfield, which continued to remain the main locale for the show for this decade. They also created several memorable characters, two in particular one that would last until the show ended in September 2009 and another that would be one of the most talked about characters on all of daytime. In 1970, Soderberg and Sommer concluded the story line of Dr. Sara McIntyre being gaslighted by her first husband Lee Gantry and his housekeeper Miss Mildred Foss, with Foss meeting a gruesome end in January 1970 and Gantry one in August 1970. Soderberg and Sommer then moved on to setting up the killing of Stanley Norris, in November 1971, and great mystery for several months and a trial where heroine, Leslie Jackson Bauer Norris, who had married Stanley earlier that year, was accused of the crime and Soderberg and Sommer presented a very memorable last minute confession of the crime by another woman, who was the mother of one of the young women that Stanley was having an affair with, who would end up dying in the court from heart attack. Soderberg and Sommer also wrote most of the set-up to how both the characters of Katherine \\"Kit\\" Vestid and Charlotte Waring Bauer would become one of the most interesting pair of villainess seen on television up to that point, that would be concluded by the next writing regime. On April 1, 1971, a new character was introduced, by Soderberg and Sommer, who would become one of the most major and remembered characters in daytime, Roger Thorpe, played by Michael Zaslow, originally a junior executive employee of Stanley Norris', off-an-on until the spring of 1997. (Thorpe would stay on the canvas until the spring of 1998, but at that time from the spring of 1997 with an unpopular recast. Roger Thorpe would die off-screen in the fall of 2004.) During the 1970s, into April 1, 1980, the character of Roger Thorpe became more and more of a villain, but a complicated, multi-faceted one. It seemed the more bad Roger became, the more the audience grew and wanted more of him. And Roger's on-and-off again tortured romance with another character started under Soderberg and Sommer, Holly Norris Bauer Thorpe, Stanley Norris' daughter (played by Lynn Deerfield and then more memorably by Maureen Garrett), who was supposedly the \\"love of Roger's life\\". became one of the most popular and riveting romances on television period. (Holly was the character that was created by Soderberg and Sommer who would last, on-and-off until the show's end in September 2009.) Shortly before Soderberg and Somer's exit as head writers, long time cast member (on 24 years at the time, both on radio and television), Theo Goetz who played Papa Bauer, the patriarch of the Bauers, as well as most of the rest of the citizens of both Selby Flats and later Springfield, died on December 29, 1972 at the age of 78 years. Goetz had been considering retirement at age 75 in 1969, but was persuaded by then Executive Producer of The Guiding Light, Luci Ferri Rittenberg to stay on at the show as Papa Bauer. Soderberg and Somer wrote a fitting tribute episode, after having Papa die in his sleep, to both Goetz and Papa that aired on February 27, 1973, with a memorial service, with Mart Hulswit playing Dr. Ed Bauer, Papa's grandson, giving a very memorable eulogy and Don Stewart, playing Michael \\"Mike\\" Bauer, Papa's other grandson, singing one of Papa's favorite songs, I'll Walk With God. Not that the writing of Soderberg and Sommer didn't have its critics, one being long time cast member, Charita Bauer. Under Soderberg and Sommer, to spice things up just a bit, the already airing romantic triangle between the two Bauer sons, Mike and Ed, and the character of Leslie Jackson Bauer Norris heated up, with Charita Bauer's character of Bert, who was the mother of both of the men, finding out about the romance (finally) in a most shocking way‚Äîduring Leslie's trial, via a nosy television news reporter, for supposedly murdering Stanley Norris! This story line was criticized by Charita Bauer, whose role moved in time from Bauer matriarch to the beacon of support for the entire town. Bauer was quoted as saying, \\"Now [the show's producers] don't really care about the idea of the family anymore. That used to be the main theme of the show, but now it's gone.\\" Feeling pressure from newer, more youth-oriented serials such as The Young and the Restless, All My Children, and Ryan's Hope, Procter & Gamble hired head writers Bridget and Jerome Dobson in 1975. The Dobsons first started writing in November 1975 taking over from Gentile, Cenedella and Lipton. The married duo focused on core characters, giving Bert her first real story line in years when her husband Bill came back from the dead. The Dobsons also gave a last name to a character introduced near the end of the last writing regime, in September 1975. Under The Dobsons this character became one of the sexiest and most complicated \\"vixens\\" (The Dobsons are credited with making her a complicated \\"vixen\\") in the show's history when nurse Rita Stapleton arrived in Springfield and later was joined, in the summer of 1976, by her sweet sister Eve and mother Viola. The Dobsons also created two families that were to become prominent in story lines all the way to the show's end in September 2009, the Spauldings and the Marlers. A matter of fact, Ross Marler (introduced by The Dobsons on March 23, 1979) would remain part of the show's canvas, until later writers killed him off, in 2006 (the actor who played Ross, Jerry verDorn would stay with the show until the fall of 2005 which made him the longest running {consecutively} cast member, at that time, of all time 26 years and which only became second for all-time only eclipsed by Charita Bauer's record of 34 years that she set in the fall of 1984), and the character of Alan Spaulding (introduced by The Dobsons on November 7, 1977) would remain part of the show's canvas off-and-on until September 2009, although with two major recasts. Also the longest running recurring character began under The Dobsons, Cedars Hospital's OB-GYN Dr. Margaret Sedwick. Dr. Sedwick first made her appearance in September 1979 during Jackie Scott Marler Spaulding's difficult pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage. Dr. Sedwick and the actress who played her from the beginning, Margaret Gwenver (Sedwick was Gwenver's married name) would help many women characters through pregnancies and miscarriages through the years (as well as being a major part of Lillian Raines' diagnosis and recovery from breast cancer) and would last be seen in 2009 a few months before the show ended. The Dobsons also are credited with writing, and then the producers presenting, the first ever marital rape story line in daytime, when by then married couple Roger Thorpe raped his wife, Holly Norris Bauer Thorpe on the March 5, 1979 episode of Guiding Light. And the rape was considered one of the most realistic looking rapes in daytime (a few months earlier, in October 1978, Roger had raped Rita Stapleton, with actor Michael Zaslow and actress Lenore Kasdorf both complaining that that rape was made to look like to the audience as though it was very romantic, instead of an act of violence.) This story line was considered one of the most controversial and most thought provoking story lines in daytime history (on ABC's General Hospital, the character of Luke had already raped the character of Laura, but those two characters were not yet married at that time, so Guiding Light Roger raping Holly still holds as the first ever marital rape on a soap opera), with a very interesting follow-up of a major trial (where the then new character of attorney Ross Marler defended Roger), and then in June 1979 Holly would shoot Roger (with his gun), three times in the chest, when it looked like he was going to be acquitted, he threatened to take their daughter Chrissy out of the country and fought with Holly's former husband (and Rita's current husband, Dr. Ed Bauer) and Ed was losing the fight. (This shooting would be one of the two events on the videotape presented to the Daytime Emmy Award voting panel in 1980 for the Guiding Light to win its first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Daytime Drama in May 1980.) Roger was secretly taken out of the country with the help of his boss Alan Spaulding and declared dead and Holly would become the first major female soap opera character to spend an appreciative amount of time (6 months) in a woman's prison for supposedly murdering her husband (until Mike Bauer had the body exhumed and it turned out not to be Roger's.) The Dobsons though were criticized for two major story line moves. The first of those was their killing off of Leslie Jackson Bauer Norris Bauer, in June 1976 (by then part of what appeared to be a stable couple that could have made Leslie a tent pole character for many years later.) There is disagreements over what made The Dobsons kill off Leslie via a drunk driver, but many in the audience considered this move of killing off of a well-liked heroine the beginning of the end for the show. Another unpopular and to some of the audience odd move, and the direction the story took, by The Dobsons was the bringing back of Bill Bauer from the \\"dead\\" in the fall of 1977. This move was met with an unpopular backlash and thought of as odd, because much of the long time audience had remembered in September 1968, before Bill Bauer was supposedly killed off in an Alaskan plane crash in July 1969, that he was given only nine years to live post a heart transplant. Also it appeared to much of the audience that The Dobsons themselves seemed to lose interest in the coming back from the dead of Bill Bauer, when by May 1978, the character was gone out of story line, only to return for brief appearances in November 1978, April 1980, August 1983 (when the character was killed off) and November 1983 (in flashbacks of another character.) In early 1974, the theme of the show and its background music was changed from acoustic organ-based to orchestra-based. The version of the opening and closing themes, \\"La Lumi√®re,\\" by Charles Paul, first used in 1968 (and scored for piano and organ), was re-scored by Mr. Paul in an orchestral version, and the billboards and titles, were changed as well.See https://www.youtube.com/soapluvva#play/all/uploads-all/0/3es3Yk2O4Zc for some recordings of the piano-organ version and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2LlUzOH4fE for a recording of the orchestral version. On November 5, 1975, the name was changed in the show's opening and closing visuals from The Guiding Light to Guiding Light in an attempt to modernize the show's image, and, at the same time, the show adopted the harp- and-string-laced \\"Ritournelle,\\" by Charles Paul, as its theme song, accompanied by a somewhat abstracted visual of sunlight filtering through leaves on a tree. The serial was still called The Guiding Light by CBS (and the show's staff announcers, most notably Alan Berns who began his tenure with the program in 1969 and would last as show announcer until the spring of 1997) until fall 1981, when \\"The\\" was completely dropped from references and a more upbeat musical theme was adopted. On November 7, 1977, the show expanded to a full hour. Although there had been one remote location shooting on The Guiding Light both in the summer of 1969 and the summer of 1970 in the English countryside of Great Britain, remote location shooting picked up speed in the last two years of the 1970s on Guiding Light starting with shooting of a pair of story lines, one that took place in Nassau, Bahamas in June 1978 and then Santo Domingo in July to September 1978. This was also another pressure that CBS and Procter & Gamble put the Guiding Light under in the last two years of the 1970s due to the other more popular soaps doing the same. (Prior to 1975, when the last two soaps, As the World Turns and The Edge of Night went from airing live to tape, remote location shooting was considered rare in soaps and also too expensive for their budgets.) In the fall of 1978, the show would have some of the cast shoot outside the studios in New York City and also shoot in upstate New York at the same time. (Ed Bauer's mansion house and the Spaulding mansion house, had some of the location shooting done in upstate New York at the time, and that would be seen, again, in the 1980s and 1990s.) In 1979, there would be further remote location shooting for the show done in Saint Lucia, Puerto Rico, Florida and other parts of the Caribbean. The pioneering new wave band Television paid tribute to the show in 1977 by including a song entitled \\"Guiding Light\\" on their debut album Marquee Moon.

The sounds that Sara continued to hear up on the roof continued with Lee and Miss Mildred Foss continuing to chalk them up to squirrels on the roof. One night in January 1970 with there being a lot of thunderstorms, while Lee was out of town, the sounds on the roof were particularly frightening to Sara and so she decided to go upstairs to the attic to investigate taking her gun with her. When Sara walked into the attic she saw a shadowy figure by the bay window and took a shot at it. The figure fell, and when Sara approached it, it ended up being the dead body of Miss Mildred Foss! Fortunately for Sara, the District Attorney's office ruled the incident an accident and dismissed any charges against Sara. But that didn't mean things with Sara at the farmhouse were copacetic, because Lee Gantry was still after her money and continued alone the gaslighting actions set in motion by him and Miss Mildred Foss a year earlier on his own. Sara spent a brief amount of time \\"resting\\" in the mental ward at Cedars where her former boyfriend, Dr. Paul Fletcher was still sympathetic, but thought Sara was blowing things out of proportion that were going on at the farmhouse. But Dr. Joe Werner continued to expect otherwise. Although Joe was fighting off the attentions of both Charlotte Waring and Kit Vestid at this time, Joe's main romantic interest remained the married Sara Gantry. With that romantic interest of Joe's and Sara's continuing problems at the farmhouse, enter the returning Meta Bauer Banning who told Joe she remembered visiting, as a child, Lee's first wife, Alice Rawlings' rambling family estate just outside Springfield, Meta recalled playing games at the farm as a child with Alice. Joe also enlisted Mike Bauer to help investigate the strange going on's at the farm and was able to poke some holes into some of lies that Lee was telling regarding Sara enough where Joe informed a disbelieving Sara that, \\"Lee Gantry married you for your money.\\" But Joe found out he needed to do a little more investigating in England at the Rawlings estate there and when he went in July 1970 to do so, he wasn't disappointed to discover more evidence that Lee was up to no good as both Miss Mildred Foss' boyfriend Tyler Meade and another English private detective Dusty McGuire (James Donnelly) both informed Joe that there had long been suspicions about Lee and that he murdered Alice, just because of him moving the English estate house over to the farm outside of Springfield. On the August 1970 day that Joe returned to Springfield, Sara remembered Meta mentioning one of the games she used to play with Alice revealed to Meta a loose brick in the chimney in the farmhouse barn that Lee had transferred into the new architect of the house, itself. Sara went up to the attic to investigate and sure enough found the loose brick and found behind it Alice's diary that came open and Sara found that Alice had written about her suspicions about Lee. At that moment Lee came home and discovered Sara upstairs reading the diary and tried to murder Sara with one of loose floor boards knocking her out and leaving her for dead, fortunately Joe showed up and accessing the situation fought with Lee nearly losing when Lee started to choke him. Joe fought Lee off and pushed him hard backwards that made Lee going flying and then falling out of the glass of the bay window and three stories to his death! After Sara recovered at Cedars from her injuries, Sara was indeed grateful to Joe for saving her life and Joe was also exonerated in the death of Lee with it being ruled an accident and self-defense. And despite Kit and Charlotte wishing otherwise on New Year's Eve 1970 (December 31, 1970), Sara and Joe were married. Nurse Leslie Jackson Bauer's marriage to Stanley Norris ended up being a somewhat not very funny joke, as Leslie attended to her and Ed's new son Frederick \\"Freddy\\" (later Rick) and Stanley continued to have affairs all over town. Then in September 1971, Stanley Norris was found in his office shot to death. There were many suspects to the murder in Springfield, as many people were identified as having threatened him. But put on trial for the murder of Stanley was his third wife, Leslie, who was discovered by an employee of Stanley's over his dead body. (Charles Eiler also told the police that while he was walking his dog out in the rain, he saw Leslie running through the park in the pouring rain, earlier that evening, crying and shouting, \\"I could kill that man!\\") Mike Bauer would defend Leslie (as he had Peggy almost two years earlier). In the end, Marion Conway would confess to shooting Stanley because she was deeply troubled that her daughter, Linell had fantasies about her boss, Stanley, divorcing Leslie and marrying her. Stanley treated Linell like garbage. After Marion's eleventh-hour confession, she would suffer a heart attack and die in the courtroom. After Leslie was acquitted of Norris' murder, Linell left Springfield to make a fresh start. Through all of this, Mike's marriage to Charlotte continued to go down hill as all the stories that Mike was hearing from Hope and Bert about Charlotte being an awful stepmother to Hope were revealed to Mike to be true. During Leslie's trial, Charlotte also could tell that Mike was still very much in love with Leslie and Mike made no attempt to hide his true feelings for Leslie and that he wanted to divorce Charlotte and marry Leslie. But Charlotte was going to have none of that, she was growing accustomed to the life style of being a lawyer's wife. Charlotte became so jealous of Leslie and resentful of Mike's time with her, that she threw Mike's law books out in the pouring rain. And then she attempted to become pregnant by Mike. Unfortunately another party soon came into the picture, in the summer of 1972, Flip Malone escaped prison and then kidnapped Charlotte who had just told Bert that she was pregnant. Bert and Papa were angered by Mike when they found out that he and Leslie had started back up their affair, and Bert forced Mike's hand that he needed to go and rescue Charlotte, which he did. Unfortunately while Flip Malone was holding her hostage, Charlotte had a miscarriage and lost the child (Flip ended up dead in a shoot out with Mike.) Mike and Leslie looked like they were going to be able to get married anyway, until unfortunately, for them, Charlotte picked up a very interesting new ally in her quest to stay married to Mike, Dr. Steve Jackson, who told Mike he better not cause a scandal for his daughter by divorcing Charlotte who had just suffered a miscarriage. Mike and Leslie were forced to wait when Steve exhibited signs of having another heart attack. Charlotte then claimed she was pregnant, again, but was really not and the court, in winter of 1973, granted Mike a divorce from Charlotte. But for a while, Steve still thought that Charlotte might be pregnant and kept up that he was not going to let Mike and Leslie marry. Eventually though Steve gave-in and in the late spring of 1973, Mike and Leslie were finally wed. Although Johnny Fletcher was a good husband to Peggy and a good stepfather to Billy, Peggy and Johnny Fletcher's marriage hit the skids when he started to become overworked at Cedars with everyone telling Peggy that Johnny's work, as a doctor, was becoming erratic. (Peggy was surprised when she was confronted on that issue by a trio of Sara, her old nemesis Charlotte Waring Bauer and Dr. Steve Jackson.) Peggy was at wit ends, as Johnny became even more mentally unbalanced. Then in December 1972, Johnny just up and left town for parts unknown. For a long time Peggy had no idea what to do, to go ahead and have the marriage annulled or declare Johnny legally dead? For a while, Peggy just had to become the best both father and mother to Billy and work at Cedars as a nurse the best she could. Although they deeply loved each other, Sara and Joe's marriage became strained and Joe began having an affair with Sara's nemesis Charlotte Waring. Joe soon confessed the affair to Sara, but in the meantime, in August 1973, Charlotte was rushed to Cedars after suffering an apparent heart attack. Joe tried to save her life, but she did not pull through, and he was blamed for her death, which caused Cedars to deny him privileges and he was fired as a doctor which catapulted him into a self-destructive affair with the unstable Kit Vested, who'd had an obsession with Joe for some time. Joe made plans with Kit to leave Springfield. It would later come out that Kit had caused Charlotte's death by poisoning her tea, and, in an attempt to get her out of the way so she could be with Joe, she later poisoned Sara, poisoning her coffee. Fortunately, Joe learned of Kit's plans at the airport and was able to make it to Sara to get her to the hospital in time. Unfortunately Joe discovered that Kit was still in the house and Kit pointed a gun at Sara's head. Joe tried to talk Kit into giving him the gun, but they ended up in a struggle for the gun. During the struggle Kit was shot dead instead in April 1974, and Joe was shot and injured. When it was revealed to all that Kit had killed Charlotte, Joe was exonerated of Charlotte's death and was reinstated at Cedars. After Kit's death, Sara and Joe tried to resume their relationship, adopting a son, Timothy \\"T.J.\\". But Joe had a developed a heart condition, due to his being shot by Kit, and eventually had a heart attack in December 1976, while in India, and Sara was once again a widow. Papa Bauer died in his sleep in February 1973, a few months after Goetz died in December 1972. Religious matters gave way to cementing the bonds of family. In the 1970s, Bert Bauer's two sons fought over the lovely Leslie. Although Leslie loved Ed, her marriage to him didn't work, due to his alcoholism, and she became involved with his brother Mike. When things seemed to have finally resolved and she was happy with Mike, Leslie was tragically killed in a hit-and-run accident in June 1976, leaving behind her and Ed's young son Freddie (known in later years as \\"Rick\\"). Mike and Leslie had overall an idyllic marriage (with the only two problems, besides Leslie's being put on trial falsely for Stanley's murder, being that Leslie would find out that Roy Mill's and not Dr. Steve Jackson was her biological father, and Mike being somewhat unsatisfied with Leslie wanting to better herself education wise). However, the lives of Ed, and Barbara and Stanley's children, Ken and Holly, took some rather interesting twists and turns. In December 1969, Ed had returned to Springfield after having learned of his father's presumed death in a plane crash, and Janet soon followed. Unfortunately, Janet was to learn that Ed was still in love with Leslie. Then Janet's father, Grove Mason also showed up in Springfield. When Grove discovered that Ed had been unfaithful to Leslie with his daughter, Grove confronted Ed at Cedars hospital and collapsed and died from a heart attack. Leslie would then grant Ed a divorce and married, first Stanley and later, Mike. Ed would be pursued by several women, but Janet cooled things off, still upset about her father's death. For a while, Ken Norris started a relationship with his former stepmother, Kit Vestid, but later would be attracted to the now available Janet Mason. It was a shock when Ken, who was Mike Bauer's law partner, ended up marrying Janet, because Ken was known to be somewhat mentally unstable. Janet seemed to love the man despite this knowledge. Meanwhile, Holly ended up in Cedars after nearly being run into by a car, and Ed became her physician. After having a series of uneventful relationships, the now 30-year-old Ed was wowed by Holly and, in late 1973, agreed to go to Las Vegas with her. Holly, not realizing that Ed was an alcoholic, got him drunk and then married him. When Holly and Ed returned to Springfield everyone was also shocked, none more than Ed's aunt Meta, who vehemently took a dislike to Holly. Meta's third husband Bruce Banning and Bert tried to tell Meta to not interfere, but Holly heard what Meta felt about her and was concerned that Ed might leave her at any moment. For his part, Ed, who felt somewhat remorseful over how he'd treated Leslie during their marriage, resolved to make his marriage to Holly work, despite the circumstances of their union. Janet found out that her mother, Ellen Mason had become an alcoholic after her husband's death. Janet asked Ed to help get her mother into Alcoholics Anonymous, and Ken seeing the two of them together started to become pathologically and violently jealous. While Kit was going after Joe and Sara Werner, Ken started to become violent with Janet, forcing her to have sex with him so she would get pregnant, which she did. She gave birth to a daughter named Emily. After the birth of Emily, Ellen started to go to AA, Janet developed back problems due to the difficult delivery of Emily, and Ken started to seem more mentally stable after Janet forced Ken to see a psychiatrist. Then he truly became loving and devoted to both Janet and Emily. But one evening when Ellen had an alcoholic relapse, Ken caught Janet and Ed talking privately to each other and Ken became even more jealous and stopped going to see his psychiatrist and stopped taking his medications. Ken did not tell Janet or his partner Mike about this. A few evenings later, while he and Janet were out on a date, Ken drove the car into a tree. Ken and Janet were taken to Cedars emergency room, and although bruised Janet seemed fine, Ken appeared to be blind. But none of the doctors could see any reason for Ken's blindness. Of course, Ken was faking his blindness. When Janet desperately started clinging more closely to Ed, Ken became even more jealous. Ken also talked his then pregnant sister, Holly, into believing the worst about Ed and Janet's renewed closeness, with their mother Barbara scolding both of them about how they were treating their spouses. Although Holly seemed to agree with her mother, secretly Ken did not. Then one evening, in April 1975, things came to ahead when Ken (who had secretly bought a revolver) went to Holly and Ed's house and waited outside in the bushes in front of the house. When Ed came home with Janet, Ken came out of the bushes and shot Ed in his right hand. Ed was taken to Cedars, and it would be learned that he could no longer perform surgery with his right hand. Ken was taken to a mental hospital and would not be seen again until 1998. Janet left town with Emily and Ellen, and relocated to San Francisco, although from time to time throughout the remainder of the 1970s, Barbara was said to be visiting them. Emily and Ellen remained living in San Diego with Ellen dying in 1995 prior to Barbara Norris returning to Springfield. Ken Norris was said to be living near his daughter Emily in 1999 after he too left Springfield again. After Joe Werner's untimely death in December 1976, Sara started dating Joe's former cardiologist Justin Marler, but decided to take things more slowly when Justin's first wife, the former Jacqueline \\"Jackie\\" Scott showed up in town and Sara could tell there was still feelings between Justin and Jackie despite protesting to the contrary. Jackie also started a dalliance with the now available Mike Bauer after she hired him as her attorney. Although Mike would later break up with Jackie partly because Mike thought Jackie was too wild for his taste. Sara would ultimately end things with Justin in 1977, when she learned that he'd had a one-night stand with an ex-girlfriend, Brandy Shelloe, a writer visiting Springfield to gather information for an article she was working on. In November 1977, Alan Spaulding arrived at the long vacated Spaulding summer estate with his emotionally distant wife, Elizabeth. Elizabeth doted on young Phillip, whom she believed to be her son. In reality, her baby had been stillborn, and Alan had obtained Phillip from an unknown woman. That woman would turn out to be none other than, Jackie Marler! Although Jackie was still in love with Justin Marler, she married Alan after he and Elizabeth divorced in 1978 to make sure she was close to her son. (Justin had no idea he was a father; Alan had no idea Jackie was Phillip's mother.) Through all of this, Alan also carried on an affair with hard-boiled Diane Ballard. Originally Phillip's governess, Elizabeth fired Diane when she sensed inappropriate interactions between her and Alan; almost immediately, Alan then hired her as his personal assistant at Spaulding Enterprises. Diane, a sometime vindictive but shrewd businesswoman, harbored fantasies of being the next Mrs. Spaulding, but would continually be let down when Alan married two other women. Also brought to town for a while was Alan's personal attorney, the smooth talking Dean Blackford. Dean met the widowed Dr. Sara McIntyre, whom he romanced and married in Hawaii. Sara had attempted to romance Justin, but Justin was in over his head dealing with trashy journalist Brandy Shelloe, who had broken up his and Jackie's marriage eight years earlier. Mike Bauer tried to warn Sara that Dean was a shady character, and indeed Dean was. He tried to win sole custody of Phillip for Alan by paying off a man named Ramon de Vilar to falsely testify that Elizabeth had had an affair with him. This ploy did work for a while, and Alan was awarded sole custody after he married Jackie. Later it would be learned that Dean would have kept the de Vilar affidavits, that de Vilar had lied in court, and Dean would start being threatened. De Vilar threatened Dean that he'd admit that he had perjured himself, and Alan told Dean to deal with it as Dean saw fit. Dean then ended up shooting and killing de Vilar. Sara started having suspicions about her third husband, and Dean tried to do away with her on their honeymoon in January 1979, but Mike showed up and Dean ended falling to his death from a cliff. Elizabeth fell in love with Mike Bauer. However, she ultimately could not marry him because, thanks to Alan, Phillip blamed Mike for his parents' breakup and hated him as a result. In September 1975 a new nurse, Rita Stapleton, arrived in Springfield and began working at Cedars. Beautiful, but a bit of a social climber, Rita came from a modest upbringing in West Virginia, but was motivated to make a better life for herself. She briefly dated hotshot surgeon Tim Ryan, but didn't pursue a relationship with him, when she realized how much her friend and coworker, Cedars employee and unwed mother Pam Chandler loved him (and she even went so far as to push Tim in Pam's direction). Soon after breaking things off with Tim, Rita caught the eye of the recently separated Dr. Ed Bauer. On the rebound from neurotic Holly Norris, and depressed over his inability to perform surgery due to his hand injury, Ed had begun drinking heavily again, but he became infatuated with Rita, and was able to become sober with her help. Rita also apparently had a secret romantic past with Ed's nemesis, Roger Thorpe. Pam Chandler left Springfield, in the summer of 1976, after her former boyfriend and the father of her daughter returned to her. Tim was left without another fall back to Rita for love and pressured her to marry him. But despite her past with Roger and Tim's pressure, Rita had one man on her mind, Ed! And Ed, getting closer to divorcing Holly, was definitely willing to pursue Rita. Ed and Rita became even closer when Rita's younger sister Eve arrived in Springfield with their elderly mother Viola, who'd just suffered a stroke. Eve for a while ended up being wooed by Tim Ryan, until Eve found out that he and Rita had earlier been involved and for a few months, and blamed Rita when Tim left her and left town. Ed recruited stroke specialist Dr. Emmett Scott (Jackie Marler's father), and the two were able to help Viola make a complete recovery, and she and Eve decided to remain in Springfield. Unfortunately for Rita, a newly reformed Holly started to realize her mistakes in letting Ed and their marriage get away from her. But the divorce decree, with Holly's signature, from Mike and Holly's lawyer was about to hit Ed's desk at Cedars and Holly made one more phone call attempt at getting Ed back. But Rita discovered the phone message left in his apartment, by Holly, for Ed and ended up throwing the tape out into the garbage with Ed never hearing the message (Barbara would suspect that Rita did this and would continue to hold a grudge against Rita for the rest of the time the two were on the show.) During this time, 1975‚Äì76, Hope came back to town all grown-up and a somewhat naive college student. While at college in nearby Bay City, Hope had developed a relationship with one of her professors, Alex McDaniels. Mike was livid when he found out that Professor McDaniels was married! Bert tried to tell her son not to get involved in her granddaughter's love-life (as she had done with his in the previous decade), but Mike refused to listen. Eventually Mike went to San Francisco to confront McDaniels, and he showed up in Springfield to dump a confused and angry at her father when she found out why, Hope. Hope even moved out on Mike and Leslie and found her own apartment and a job at Roger Thorpe's night club, The Metro. A little later in 1976, Hope became infatuated with artist Ben McFarren who originally dated Pam Chandler, before she left town (Pam had also worked at The Metro when Sara had to let her go due to the rough economy. Pam told Ben she didn't feel any love for him as she did Tim Ryan.) When Hope told Mike she was over Alex McDaniels and was now seeing a much better man, Mike was happy and relieved, at first. Then Mike found out who the young man was, Ben McFarren, who Mike had defended in a robbery at a Deli several months earlier! Mike was now livid, and tried to get Hope to stop seeing this troubled young man. Although at first hesitant, Ben who was still paying restitution for the robbery, told Mike it was his younger brother Jerry who he was covering for and had actually committed the robbery. Mike then started to respect Ben for being willing to help his younger brother, as Mike had done for Ed on several occasions. But then Ben wanted Hope to pose in the nude, and Mike and Hope were both disturbed by this. Hope refused to do so, but then found one of Ben's painting was a nude of her, that Ben had painted from memory. This time, it was Mike who tried to tell Hope to have patience for Ben, but Hope refused to listen and dumped Ben and then decided to leave town to attend a design school. Ed asked Rita to marry him, but on the same day he proposed she was arrested and charged with murder. Rita, as it turned out, had a sordid past with bad boy Roger Thorpe which, unfortunately for her, came out during her ensuing murder trial. Rita was accused of murdering Cyrus Granger, an elderly rich rancher from Waco, Texas, for whom she'd worked as a private duty nurse a year earlier, as well as his son Malcolm Granger, who'd followed Rita to Springfield, and was admitted to Cedars after suffering a heart attack, where he later died under mysterious circumstances. During the lengthy trial, it was revealed that Rita could not have murdered Cyrus, as she was engaged in a sexual tryst with Roger at the time; with a solid alibi and no motive for wanting Malcolm dead, the jury also found her not guilty of his murder. The events taking place in Waco happened off-camera in 1974 and early 1975, prior to Rita's arrival in Springfield, and during a three-month-long period where Zaslow was absent from the show, so the story was told largely in flashbacks. Rita was exonerated, but at the cost of her budding relationship with Ed, who already hated Roger for his affair with Holly during their brief marriage. (Roger was, in fact the biological father of the child Holly had while married to Ed, Christina, who was born in July 1975; the truth about this came out when Chrissy needed a blood transfusion and Holly couldn't provide it because she had had hepatitis as a child. Roger had also at one point attempted to rape Holly's sister-in-law, Janet Mason Norris). On the rebound from Ed, Rita briefly dated Dr. Peter Chapman, but things did not progress when she realized that he was much more attracted to her nemesis Holly Norris Bauer. For a time, Rita was a subject of a stalker who pushed her down a flight of stairs, tampered with her brakes and set her apartment on fire (while her blind sister Eve was inside; she barely escaped). The stalker turned out to be Cyrus' mentally deranged daughter-in-law, Georgene Belmont Granger, who, regardless of the verdict, still blamed Rita for the deaths of her father-in-law, and her husband. While holding Rita and Eve at gunpoint in their apartment building laundry room in March 1978, Georgene would confess to being the real murderer of Cyrus, as well as being responsible for her husband Malcolm's death. Georgene had killed Cyrus for fear that he would change his will to leave the bulk of his fortune to Rita, unaware that he had, in fact, already done so; her husband Malcolm, admitted to Cedars following a heart attack in late 1976, died as result of a second, fatal heart attack, suffered in the midst of an argument with Georgene (who'd secretly followed him to Springfield), in which she incorrectly accused him of having had an affair with Rita. Ed and Springfield Police Chief Larry Wyatt were hiding outside the laundry room and overheard the confession, and so were able to overtake Georgene. She was arrested and Rita was then finally able to put the ordeal behind her. (Wanting no further connection to the Grangers, Rita donated the inheritance left to her by Cyrus to Cedars for construction of their proposed new pediatric wing.) Around the same time, a strange man started appearing around Springfield, following various members of the Bauer family around. A short while later, it was revealed that he was the father of Hillary Kincaid, a student nurse who'd recently moved to Springfield to do her internship at Cedars. However, Hillary became mystified when her father refused to meet any of her friends or colleagues from Cedars (particularly Ed and Rita). Shortly after this, Mike was honored as Man of the Year by the Springfield Chamber of Commerce. Rita attended the ceremony, but decided to watch from backstage so as not to run into Ed (from whom she was still estranged), and from where she was standing, she saw this same man, tearful, watching Mike receive his honor. Remembering having seen him around town, Rita followed him out and demanded to know who he was and what he was doing in Springfield. The man, \\"Bill Morrey\\", confessed to Rita that he was, in fact, Bill Bauer, Ed and Mike's presumed- dead father. He explained that during his last few years with Bert, he had also been having an affair with another woman, Simone Kincaid, in Vancouver. Although the plane he was to have been on eight years earlier had indeed crashed, Bill had actually missed the flight. In a drunken stupor, and tortured over his double life, he did not contact Bert to tell her he was alive; eventually he made his way to Simone, who got him sober, and he had remained with her ever since. Eventually he did reveal himself, first to Mike and then to Ed and then to Bert. Although he did not remain in Springfield, he was able to make peace with the Bauers. Ed and Mike also accepted Hillary as their half-sister. Bert, though, had to pay back the expenses on the life insurance payout that had happened back in 1969 when Bill had been thought of as dying in the plane crash. Roger Thorpe had been on the show and in a self- destructive relationship with Holly since 1971, but only when the Dobsons arrived did the character become truly malevolent. The meaner he got, the more popular he became with viewers. For a while, though, Roger seemed to be an upstanding citizen and even became involved with Peggy. Roger eventually even made Peggy see that it was time to have Johnny Fletcher declared legally dead. But during this time, in 1974, not everything was rosy for Peggy and Roger. Roger decided to open up a night club, The Metro, but borrowed heavily from loan sharks. Eventually he took back up with Holly, who he had been involved with off and on since his arrival on April 1, 1971. And Holly ended up bailing him out with the loan sharks (paying off the loan), after Roger was beaten-up and was afraid to go to Peggy. Holly and Roger ended up having an affair while she was married to Ed (who didn't know that he and Holly had never consummated their marriage, because he had been too drunk the night of their honeymoon and then too busy to be with her.) Holly, of course, found out she was pregnant with Chrissy and then lied to everyone that she was Ed's child (of course that would all come out after Chrissy needed a blood transfusion when she came down with hepatitis.) During all of this, Roger never told Peggy about the affair with Holly or about Chrissy. But out of a sense of guilt, not wanting to hurt Peggy or Billy, he told her anyway and then she told Ed! That is what led up to Ed and Holly's divorce. Peggy for a while kept her distance from Roger, but after Adam and Roger talked to her, she gave in and agreed to marry him with them marrying in the spring of 1976 with only Adam and Bert in attendance. Adam and Barbara's marriage though suffered through all of this, and they ended up getting a divorce when Barbara's \\"migraines\\" became too much and she blurted how angry she was at Roger and as to why (Chrissy's true parentage that Adam didn't know about up to that point.) During Rita Stapleton's trial and just before Roger made his last minute confession of their one-night stand in Waco, Roger found out that Jerry McFarren, who he had briefly hired at The Metro, had taken out his own loan against The Metro and needed to pay off loan sharks. When Jerry skipped town to let his older brother Ben take the blame in a robbery at a Deli, Roger was left to deal with loan sharks and came home to Peggy and Billy beaten up. Then Roger started to become verbally abusive to Peggy. And then when it came out about the one-night stand (Peggy expressed she could feel sympathy for Rita who was going through a similar ordeal in her trial as Peggy had eight years earlier), Peggy finally told Roger that their marriage was over! Peggy took Billy to live in Boise, Idaho. (Although in November 1977, Peggy returned to town, but left Billy in a Boise boarding school. Peggy would remain in town and working at Cedars until November 1979, but had very little interaction with Roger, and mainly was a support to all of her friends at Cedars. Peggy would end up moving back to Boise, Idaho and living with Billy.) Roger took up briefly with Hillary Kincaid Bauer, who was still vulnerable from having learned of her father's double life. Rita, who had grown close to Hillary and felt protective of her, saw that Roger was merely seeing Hillary to get to Ed and Mike (since she had been revealed to be their half-sister). On October 9, 1978, Rita confronted Roger about his misguided relationship with Hillary. Roger became enraged, blaming Rita for his own failed marriage to Peggy (due to his providing Rita an alibi during her murder trial) and raped Rita. By this time, she had patched things up with Ed and they were engaged. Rita, afraid to tell Ed for fear that he wouldn't believe her (given her and Roger's history), remained silent and they were married in November 1978. Roger also was involved with Dean Blackford, after Roger discovered the de Vilar affidavits. Dean tried to run down Roger with his car, in the Spaulding garage, but Dean didn't succeed. After Dean died, Roger stole the affidavits and would blackmail his then-boss, Alan, with them. Roger also bought a revolver, for protection, and stayed briefly in Katie and Hillary's apartment to investigate the hit-and-run (Roger assumed it was Rita wanting revenge for the rape, until he stumbled upon evidence pointing to Dean), until he wooed Holly into marrying him. (This would cause Hillary to break-up with Roger, despite the fact at the time she was working briefly at Spaulding Enterprises and had to continue to see him at work.) Holly would get mad at Roger for having a gun in the house, and Roger took it and put it in his desk drawer at Spaulding Enterprises. Zaslow was unhappy with his earlier rape scenes with Rita, which he felt came across as a seduction. The Dobsons crafted a full-fledged marital rape (at the time this was not considered a crime) in a March 1979 episode involving Roger and Holly who had married in January 1979. This rape scene was a counterattack against rival network NBC's soap opera Another World, whose much ballyhooed expansion to 90-minute telecasts (complete with the death of a major character) happened that same day. Holly bravely took Roger to court, but Justin's sleazy lawyer brother Ross, hired by Alan, got Roger acquitted. (Ross would quickly reform and became a core character, remaining on the show for the next twenty-five years.) In June 1979, when it looked as though Roger was going to be acquitted, Rita could no longer bear the guilt and came forward to confess to Ed that Roger had also raped her. Upon learning of Rita's rape, Ed angrily stormed off to confront Roger in his office at Spaulding. Meanwhile, as this was happening, Holly learned that Roger had told Chrissy (within earshot of Barbara) that he planned to take her out of the country, and also headed to Roger's office at Spaulding, walking in on Ed and Roger engaged in a fist fight. Holly pulled the gun out of Roger's desk and pointed it at Roger telling him to \\"Stop!\\" Afraid that he would be acquitted and terrified that he would take their daughter Christina out of the country, and also flashing back to the rape, Holly shot Roger three times! (The sequence of events of the shooting was the first set of scenes that were submitted that would help the show win its first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Daytime Drama in May 1980.) Roger was taken to Cedars, and then taken by Alan to a specialist out of the country and was declared legally dead. Holly was convicted, despite the extenuating circumstances and sent to prison (she'd had flashed back to the rape). While Holly was in prison, Ed and Rita raised Christina. Rita felt an enormous sense of guilt at not having come forward when Roger raped her, and felt that Ed also blamed her for Holly's troubles. To make matters worse, Ed seemed to be more concerned for Holly, and later Elaine \\"Lainie\\" Marler, Justin and Ross' younger sister (who had been a victim of a hit-and-run while training for a marathon), making Rita feel all the more neglected. She started having an affair with a former boyfriend from high school, Dr. Greg Fairbanks, who had just relocated to Springfield. Fairbanks was also dating Rita's younger sister Eve at the time, though neither sister initially knew that he was seeing the other. (Eve had just divorced her husband, artist Ben McFarren.) When Rita later found out she was pregnant, she wasn't sure if the baby was Ed's or Greg's; she initially planned to abort the pregnancy, but after discussing her situation with her mother, Viola (who offered to raise the baby herself, if Rita would go through with the pregnancy), she decided to have the baby. Shortly before Christmas 1979, Holly was released from prison when Sara and Mike showed the court that Holly had indeed flashed back to the rape the day she shot and \\"killed\\" Roger and Roger's \\"body\\" was exhumed and it turned out not to be Roger in the grave. Roger was very much alive and moved to Paris, France trying to get a woman doctor named Renee DuBois to give him, going by the name of Arthur Green, a face lift. (Renee gave him only surface face changes, realizing that Arthur Green was a suspicious character.) Then in February 1980, Roger attempted to abduct Christina from a charity carnival for Cedars at a nearby park, but instead, in an Emmy-winning sequence (the second set of scenes submitted), circumstances led to his chasing a pregnant Rita through a hall-of-mirrors as the Donna Summer/Barbra Streisand hit \\"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\\" played in the background. Roger kidnapped Rita, holding her captive in the Bauer cabin for several days. When in haste to escape Mike and Ed who were closing in, he knocked over a kerosene lantern, setting the cabin on fire. Ed and Mike were able to rescue Rita, but the baby did not survive the ordeal. (The baby would turn out to be a boy and be Ed's son‚Äînot Greg's as Rita had feared.) Kasdorf was also pregnant in real life at the time and later said that she found the emotional scenes were tough to play; the actress would take several months of maternity leave shortly after filming the miscarriage scenes. (It was explained that Rita returned with her mother, Viola, for a visit to West Virginia.) Roger would later attempt to kidnap Christina, in Santo Domingo but ended up kidnapping Holly, leading her into the Island of Lost Soul's jungle with Ed and Mike in pursuit. Roger would also be responsible for the death of Dr. Renee DuBois, who had arrived in town to testify at some future point that Arthur Green was indeed Roger. Renee in her short time in Springfield developed romantic feelings for Mike Bauer (he did as well back), but one evening Roger entered her hotel room and shocked her. As a scared Renee was backing out away from him she ended up falling backwards to her death, dying in Mike's arms. The Bauers' and the Spauldings' lives grew ever-more complicated as Alan married Mike's daughter Hope, against the wishes of her father. (Mike still resented Alan for sabotaging his relationship with ex-wife Elizabeth Spaulding, by poisoning his son Philip against Mike, and also because he felt certain that Alan was involved in criminal activity, possibly working with Roger.) Upon Rita's return to Springfield during the summer of 1980, she and Ed tried to resume their marriage, but were forced to admit that they'd grown too far apart; Rita and Alan became close during this time, and eventually, their relationship evolved into an ongoing affair (despite the fact that Rita was, by marriage, Hope's aunt). When the affair finally was exposed by blackmailer Andy Norris in June 1981, Rita left town for good. In 1977, the character Nurse Katie Parker was introduced around the same time that Roger's first wife (and longtime Bauer friend) Nurse Peggy Scott Dilman Fletcher Thorpe (still played by Fran Myers) left town with her teenage son Billy Fletcher, after learning about the tryst Roger had had with Rita. (Peggy and Myers though did make a return to the show from November 1978 to November 1979 when she came for Ed and Rita's wedding and stayed on staff at Cedars while others were busy with several other activities.) Kind natured, though somewhat insecure and weight-conscious, Katie became roommates with Hillary Bauer and, for a time, struck up a romance with Dr. Mark Hamilton who kept putting off marrying Katie. Hillary was also not bereft of suitors after her nasty break up with Roger Thorpe. Katie's rough-edged younger brother, Floyd Parker, showed up on Katie and Hillary's doorstep in March 1979 and took an instant shine to Hillary. Hillary though found Floyd not to be to her liking and still felt gun shy to get involved in relationship post her break-up with Roger. Floyd also found himself falling for Justin and Ross' younger sister, Lainie Marler, who had to learn to walk again (let alone run track and field as she had done before) after being run into by a van. Lainie briefly became enamored of both Ed and Mark while in recovery at Cedars. Katie for a time became a television personality involved with a children's show and later learned that Mark was two-timing her with other women and dumped him. Lainie briefly worked for Mike and another attorney, Derek Colby introduced in 1980, after Ann Jeffers left for another job offer. Lainie would later get involved with Chicago art gallery owner Carter Bowden and would marry him in February 1981 and they would move to Chicago. Lainie was briefly seen in June and July 1982. Mike got Holly's friend and former prison inmate, Clara Jones (played by Anna Maria Horsford) released from prison. Horsford was one of the first African-American characters on the show to be given a substantial story line. Mike proved that Clara had not shot her husband, but that he was killed by drug dealers with whom he had gotten involved (the same ones that had driven the van that hit Lainie Marler.) Hillary, though, would turn down both Floyd. During 1979, and early 1980, Hillary, Floyd, Katie and Mark provided much of the comic relief on the show. In July 1978, Lucille Wexler and her daughter Amanda Wexler were introduced via Eve Stapleton and her husband, artist Ben McFarren. Ben had originally been romantically involved with Mike's daughter, Hope, back in 1976. But when Hope found out that Mike and Ben were covering up crimes involving Ben's younger brother, Jerry McFarren, Hope dumped him and left Springfield for a while, until she returned in 1979. (Hope and Jerry did make a brief visit to Springfield for Ed and Rita's wedding in November 1978.) Unfortunately, as she left town, Eve caught sight of Ben kissing Hope (not realizing they were saying goodbye), and ran out in the pouring rain, tripped and fell. This was the onset of a disease that had an 80% chance of leaving Eve blind. Not wanting to be a burden to Ben and against his strenuous objections, Eve insisted on canceling their November 24, 1977 wedding. Eventually, the couple found their way back to one another. Eve was still blind when she and Ben were married on May 26, 1978. Later, a risky surgery helped regain Eve's eyesight. After they returned to Springfield from a second honeymoon, Ben and Eve moved into the Wexler Estate's small guest cottage. Lucille, an insecure, controlling woman, disapproved of Eve and her friends and family's rather liberal ways, and started becoming suspicious of the McFarrens. Lucille was harboring a secret that confused both Amanda and Amanda's first husband, architect Gordon Middleton, who Amanda left on her honeymoon when she couldn't be intimate with him. Later, Eve would find out from Gordon that the reason for Amanda's lack of intimacy stemmed from watching Lucille being raped by a man, when Amanda was a young girl. But Lucille was apparently harboring more secrets than that, because when Ben tried to show his art work at the Binnoker art gallery to raise funds to send Eve to college to fulfill her dream of becoming a teacher (as her mother had been), Lucille secretly burned down the gallery. With no funds to send Eve to school, Lucille hired Ben and Eve to do various odd jobs around the main house at the Wexler Estate, and Ben was hired as a graphic artist at Spaulding Enterprises. Eve and Ben became virtual slaves to Lucille. Ben also met up with the wild Diane Ballard, who, in her loneliness waiting for Alan, seduced Ben and they had an affair. At the same time Ben got Amanda to put away her dolls and stop acting like a child, and restart her dream of becoming a concert pianist. Amanda herself was falling for the worldly Ben, and Lucille started becoming nervous that Ben was going to find out all her secrets. She started to find ways to get Ben in trouble, and even kill him. The first thing Lucille did was make sure that in a visit to the Wexler Estate by Diane, Amanda found out about Ben and Diane's affair. A livid Amanda told Eve, which caused Eve to leave Ben, and move out on her own. Eve would first start a relationship with Dr. Greg Fairbanks (who was simultaneously having an affair with her sister Rita) and then surprisingly, with Ross Marler. Ross would be hired by Lucille as her attorney, and Ross would fall for Amanda, creating a very interesting quadrangle between Eve-Ben-Amanda-Ross. Amanda also helped Ben get a gallery showing of his art work at Carter Bowden's Chicago gallery. Meanwhile, Lucille continued to look for ways to kill Ben, even though Lucille apparently had a debilitating stroke. Then in the November 1979, Lucille was summoned by Alan Spaulding's father, Brandon Spaulding to his \\"death\\" bed, and the audience would learn the startling secret that Lucille was hiding: that Amanda was actually the product of an affair between Alan and a woman that Alan had known when he was younger, Jane Marie Stafford. When Ben started to become suspicious of Lucille's involvement in Brandon's \\"death\\", Lucille continued to find even more bizarre ways to kill her nemesis, Ben McFarren. Of course Lucille couldn't stop Ben and Amanda from eventually marrying in March 1980.

He was the successor of Saint Philastrius. Biography Gaudentius had studied under Philastrius, and was a preacher in Italy and the Middle East. When Philastrius died around 387, the people of Brescia elected Gaudentius as bishop ‚Äìevidently against his will. He was on pilgrimage to Jerusalem when Philastrius had died.CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Gaudentius The Catholic Encyclopedia states that ‚Äúthe people of Brescia bound themselves by an oath that they would accept no other bishop than Gaudentius; and St. Ambrose and other neighboring prelates, in consequence, obliged him to return, though against his will. The Eastern bishops also threatened to refuse him Communion if he did not obey.‚Äù He was consecrated by Saint Ambrose in 387. A record of the discourse made by Gaudentius on the occasion of his consecration survives. Gaudentius reported upon his consecration that he had brought back with him from the Holy Land relics of Saint John the Baptist, the Apostles, relics of saints from Milan, and of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. The nieces of Saint Basil had given him the relics of the Forty Martyrs at Caesarea in Cappadocia. He deposited these relics in a basilica that he named Concilium Sanctorum, and wrote a sermon upon its dedication. Writings Twenty-one tractates attributed to Gaudentius survive. Gaudentius also wrote many pastoral letters. Ten of his sermons have survived.Patron Saints Index: Saint Gaudentius His Easter sermons were written down at the request of the Brescian nobleman Benivolus, who had been too ill to listen to Gaudentius speak. Defense of Saint John Chrysostom Gaudentius and the Archbishop of Constantinople, Saint John Chrysostom, were friends; the two may have met at Antioch.‚ÄúFrom a letter of St. Chrysostom (Ep. clxxxiv) to Gaudentius it may be gathered that the two had met at Antioch.‚Äù http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06393c.htm Gaudentius joined a delegation in 405 sent by Innocent I and Honorius to defend Chrysostom. The delegation was sent to speak with the Eastern Emperor Arcadius to defend Chrysostom after the latter had been accused by the member of what was considered a heretical sect, and exiled. Gaudentius and his companions, two bishops, encountered many difficulties and never reached their goal of entering Constantinople. At the start of their journey Gaudentius and his two companions had been seized at Athens. They were sent to Constantinople, a journey of three days on a ship without food. However, they were not allowed to enter the city, and were imprisoned in the fortress of Athyra, in Thrace. An attempt to bribe them into speaking with Archbishop Atticus of Constantinople, the man who had replaced Chrysostom, failed, but one of the thumbs of the three travelers was broken during a scuffle in which Byzantine officials had seized the bishops‚Äô credentials by force. Gaudentius and his two companions were then put on board an unseaworthy vessel; it was alleged that the ship‚Äôs captain had orders to wreck them. The travelers arrived safely, however, at Lampsacus. They departed for Italy and arrived at Otranto after twenty days. Despite the failure of the mission, Chrysostom sent a letter of thanks to Gaudentius. Palladius of Galatia preserved an account by Gaudentius of his four-month adventure (Dialogus, 4). Veneration Gaudentius's relics were kept at Brescia in the church of San Giovanni, built on the site of the ancient Concilium Sanctorum. Gaudentius was depicted in altar-pieces by painters of Brescia, including Moretto, Savoldo, and Romanino.
