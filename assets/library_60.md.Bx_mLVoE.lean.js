The man Lyrics to Cadet Rousselle on the back of a 19th-century dinner plate from France. Other side of the plate Guillaume Rousselle was born in Orgelet, Jura on April 30, 1743, and died in Auxerre on January 28, 1807. In his 1945 book on Cadet Rousselle, Pierre Pinsseau details Rousselle's life in Auxerre beginning with his 1783 arrival in the town. The circumstances and exact date of Guillaume Rousselle's arrival in Auxerre are unknown, but it is believed to be 1763, one year after the death of his father. His first jobs included work as a domestic servant and lackey and later he worked as a bailiff's clerk.Pinsseau, P. \\"Cadet-Roussel (1743-1807)\\", Paris, R. Clavreuil, 1945. On March 15, 1780, he petitioned the Lieutenant General of the Bailiwick of Auxerre for the position of head bailiff of the Bailiwick and Courts of Auxerre. His eligibility for this position was confirmed by his Majesty on March 8, 1780, which shows that he had been living in the town for several years. His appointment in 1780 as a Court bailiff provided sufficient income to allow the purchase of a small house, which had an old porch on top of which he added a construction in the shape of a narrow loggia. He was seen as a jovial bon vivant, a little eccentric, but he enjoyed the sympathy of his fellow citizens. In Auxerre, he was seen as \\"good revolutionary\\", perhaps a little too much so. After a stint in prison between 1794 and 1795, he carefully limited his activities to his official duties as bailiff. In his 1874 novel Ninety-Three, Victor Hugo has Danton mock Robespierre for monopolizing the floor at the Convention for two hours: :Cadet Rousselle made speeches :That are not long when they are short. The song In 1792, Gaspard de Chenu, a writer of spiritual and satirical songs, wrote the song \\"Cadet Rousselle\\" to the tune of a song about Jean de Nivelle. The song spread beyond the limits of the city when volunteers from Auxerre introduced it to the Arm√©e du Nord. It later spread through all levels of society. In 1919 John Ireland, Arnold Bax, Frank Bridge and Eugene Goossens wrote Variations on \\"Cadet Roussel\\" as an encore piece for voice and piano. In 1930 Goossens arranged this composite work for small orchestra, publishing it as his Op. 40.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. (1951), Vol. III, p. 715 Cadet Rouselle was also used by Tchaikovsky in his ballet The Nutcracker, along with other children's songs. The film Cadet Rousselle was the title of a 1954 French film by Andr√© Hunebelle. It is a freely interpreted film that based itself on the song and the recurrence of the number 3 in many aspects of the character's adventures.

The series is about four friends who pool their skills together to crack San Francisco's toughest murder cases. The women each have different jobs: Lindsay Boxer, a homicide inspector for the San Francisco Police Department, Claire Washburn, a medical examiner, Jill Bernhardt, an assistant D.A., and Cindy Thomas, a reporter who just started working the crime desk of the San Francisco Chronicle. Plot summary The prologue introduces main character Inspector Lindsay Boxer, San Francisco P.D., who is in a depression and holding a gun to her head as a result of losing a love interest on a case called \\"The Honeymoon Murders\\". Book One begins with David and Melanie Brandt, freshly married, in their hotel room at the Grand Hyatt. A man outside the door calls \\"Champagne\\" and David opens the door. The man, Phillip Campbell, then violently kills the bride and groom and immorally brutalizes the corpse of Melanie. The book then cuts to Inspector Lindsay Boxer in her general practitioner's office. The doctor, Dr. Roy Orenthaler, tells Lindsay that she has a rare, and deadly, blood disease called Negli's aplastic anemia. Throughout the book, Lindsay struggles with the physical side-effects of getting blood transfusions for Negli's, and the emotional aspect of having a life-threatening disease. During the appointment, she is called to the crime scene of a double murder at the Grand Hyatt. At that scene she is introduced to Cindy Thomas, covering the story. A second pair of bodies are found, and after Lindsay is told she has a new partner due to the sensitivity of the case, Cindy, Lindsay and medical examiner Claire Washburn join forces to attempt to solve the case. A 3rd pair of bodies is found in Cleveland, Ohio, which are thought to be connected to the San Francisco cases. As Lindsay and company go through the case they acquire a fourth friend, Assistant D.A. Jill Bernhardt. Together, the four friends attempt to pin down a suspect, leading to the shocking conclusion. A subplot features Lindsay's attraction to Chris Raleigh, her new partner, but will the attraction last until she soon realizes that there is nothing to lose?

It is used to refer to the loss of Iranian cultural identity through the adoption and imitation of Western models and Western criteria in education, the arts, and culture; through the transformation of Iran into a passive market for Western goods and a pawn in Western geopolitics. The phrase was first coined by Ahmad Fardid, a professor of philosophy at the University of Tehran, in the 1940s. it gained common usage following the clandestine publication in 1962 of the book Occidentosis: A Plague from the West by Jalal Al-e-Ahmad. Fardid's definition of the term as referring to the hegemony of ancient Greek philosophy, differed from its later usage as popularised by Al-e Ahmad. Gharbzadegi - from a Negligible Neologism to a Catch-Phrase. In 1965, Peter Avery referred to the topic of Al-e Ahmad‚Äôs essay as the ‚Äúdisease of Westernism,‚Äù and Al-e Ahmad himself reportedly equated it with ‚ÄúOccidentalization‚Äù. In the early 1970s, Michael Craig Hillmann used the term ‚ÄúWeststruckness,‚Äù and by the late 1970s Paul Sprachman considered ‚ÄúWeststrucktedness‚Äù archaic and ‚ÄúWest-strickenness‚Äù as cacophonic and stylistically problematic. Since then, post-revolutionary Iranian discourse has produced an impressive collection of neologisms that have, in turn, fostered lively scholarly debate. Attempting to render ‚Äúgharbzadegi‚Äù while preserving the various ideas encapsulated in Persian, Edward Mortimer in Faith and Power used ‚ÄúWestities,‚Äù a term also used in Sprachman‚Äôs translation to distinguish between the noun (gharbzadegi) and the essay‚Äôs title (‚ÄúPlagued by the West‚Äù), which is often included in German references as well (Geplagt vom Westen). ‚ÄúOccidentosis‚Äù appears in the title of Robert Campbell‚Äôs English translation and L‚Äôoccidentalite in the French. Hamid Algar opts for the term ‚ÄúXenomania‚Äù in his notes to the translation of Ayatollah Khomeini‚Äôs Islamic Government, while ‚ÄúWestomania,‚Äù is preferred by Reza Baraheni in The Crowned Cannibals, and was also chosen by Farzaneh Milani in Veils and Words. Although Roy Motaheddeh used the term ‚ÄúEuromania‚Äù in The Mantle of the Prophet, Hamid Dabashi stressed that it ‚Äúleaves much of the weight of ‚Äògharb‚Äô‚Äì which is ‚ÄòWest‚Äô not ‚ÄòEurope‚Äô ‚Äì behind‚Äù. He also emphasizes, ‚Äúthe construction of ‚Äòthe West‚Äô as a monolithic ‚ÄòOther,‚Äô quintessentially different from the historical experiences of ‚ÄòEurope,‚Äô is central to the ideological disposition of Al-e Ahmad and all other Muslim ideologues in modernity‚Äù. Assuming Al-e Ahmad was ‚Äúplaying on the word senzadegi, the affliction of wheat by an aphid[-]like pest quite common in Iran,‚Äù Brad Hanson found other renderings of gharbzadegi to be too literal. He chose ‚Äúwestoxication,‚Äù by far the predominant translation in English references, and argues that it seeks to convey both intoxication (the infatuation with the West) and infection (Westernization as the poisoning of an indigenous culture). Following Hanson, Mehrzad Boroujerdi added, ‚Äúit most closely resembles Al-e Ahmad‚Äôs usage of gharbzadegi as a medical metaphor denoting a social illness‚Äù. In contrast, John Green argued that ‚Äúwestoxication‚Äù misses both the disease and contagion in Persian, and the sense of blow. He further emphasized that the Persian participle ‚Äúzadeh‚Äù has broad semantic latitude and morphological flexibility, ‚Äúwhich carries the meanings of being struck, smitten, incapacitated, stupefied, sabotaged, diseased, infested, and infatuated, all at once‚Äù.Hendelman-Baavur, Liora, \\"The Odyssey of Jalal Al-Ahmad's Gharbzadegi - Five Decades After,\\" in Kamran Talattof ed., Persian Language, Literature and Culture: New Leaves, Fresh Looks (London and NY: Routledge, 2015), pp. 258-286. Al-e Ahmed's idea Al-e Ahmed describes Iranian behavior in the twentieth century as being \\"Weststruck.\\" The word was play on the dual meaning of \\"stricken\\" in Persian, which meant to be afflicted with a disease or to be stung by an insect, or to be infatuated and bedazzled. \\"I say that gharbzadegi is like cholera [or] frostbite. But no. It's at least as bad as sawflies in the wheat fields. Have you ever seen how they infest wheat? From within. There's a healthy skin in places, but it's only a skin, just like the shell of a cicada on a tree.\\" Al-e Ahmad argued that Iran must gain control over machines and become a producer rather than a consumer, even though once having overcome Weststruckness it will face a new malady - also western - that of 'machinestruckness'. \\"The soul of this devil 'the machine' [must be] bottled up and brought out at our disposal ... [The Iranian people] must not be at the service of machines, trapped by them, since the machine is a means not an end.\\" The higher productivity of the foreign machines had devastated Iran's native handicrafts and turned Iran into an unproductive consumption economy. \\"These cities are just flea markets hawking European manufactured goods ... [In] no time at all instead of cities and villages we'll have heaps of dilapidated machines all over the country, all of them exactly like American 'junkyards' and every one as big as Tehran.\\" The world market and global divide between rich and poor created by the machine - \\"one the constructors\\" of machines \\"and the other the consumers\\" - had superseded Marxist class analysis. Al-e Ahmad believed the one element of Iranian life uninfected by gharbzadegi was religion. Twelver Shia Islam in Iran had authenticity and the ability to move people. Discourse of authenticity Ali Mirsepasi believes that Al-e Ahmad is concerned with the discourse of authenticity along with Shariati. According to Mirsepasi, Al-e Ahmad extended his critiques of the hegemonic power of west. The critique is centered on the concept of westoxication with which Al-e Ahmad attacks secular intellectuals. He believes that these intellectuals are not able to effectively construct an authentically Iranian modernity. For that purpose, he posed the concept of ‚Äúreturn‚Äù to an Islamic culture which is authentic at the same time. Al-e Ahmad believed that avoiding the homogenizing and alienating forces of Western modernity it is necessary to return to the roots of Islamic culture. Of course this discourse was a few complicated politically. In fact, Al-e Ahmad wanted to reimagine modernity with Iranian- Islamic tradition. Impact The phrase was revived after the Iranian Revolution as the Islamic Republic sought to legitimize its campaign of nationalization and Ruhollah Khomeini's push for \\"self-sufficiency\\". =Western popular culture= \\"Gharbzadegi\\" is the title of a political song by British avant-garde musician Robert Wyatt, which appears on Old Rottenhat (Rough Trade, 1985) and can also be heard on the tribute LP Soupsongs Live: The Music of Robert Wyatt. =Eastoxification= \\"Gharbzadegi\\" has now been superseded by a new term commonly used in reference to China's growing presence in Iran. Called \\"Sharqzadegi\\", the new term is classed as fear of China's dominance.

Early family life and education Born at \\"Giant Poplars\\" in Houston, Virginia (now Halifax) to the former Hallie Bailey Craddock, and her husband, William D. Barksdale Sr. His paternal grandfather, Elisha Barksdale (1812-1887), had represented Halifax County in the Virginia House of Delegates during the final years of the Civil War (1863-5), after purchasing the Union Iron Works with partners Jonathan B. Stovall and John P Barksdale in 1862.Faye Royster Tuck, YesterdayGOne Forever: a collection of articles (Halifax County Historical Society 2004) p. 260 Though too young to enlist in the Confederate Army, as a militia cadet William Barksdale had fought at the Battle of Staunton River Bridge in 1864 before receiving his degrees and becoming a Virginia lawyer, circuit judge (initially perhaps the youngest at age 24, but elected to successive terms until his death in 1925), South Boston bank president and state senator (1897-1905) Albert Barksdale 's mother died in 1900 but he had four elder brothers, one younger brother and four older sisters, and his father remarried. One brother become a surgeon in Lynchburg, another a Richmond Bank president and one of his sisters was supervisor of elementary education and Sunday school superintendent in Halifax County.Pocahontas Wight Edmunds, History of Halifax vol. I pp. 276, 404 Educated at the local public schools and the Cluster Springs Academy, Barksdale received his college education in Lexington, Virginia, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree from Virginia Military Institute in 1911 at the age of 18.Halifacts p. 198 He then earned a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Virginia School of Law, where he was president of his class, in 1915. Barksdale practiced law in Lynchburg, Virginia, from 1915 to 1916 before leaving to enter military service. Military service Barksdale served in the United States Army from 1916 to 1922, with the Virginia-based 116th Infantry Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division in Europe during World War I. Rising to the rank of captain, Barksdale received the Distinguished Service Cross, the Croix de guerre, and the Chevalier Legion of Honor. =Distinguished Service Cross citation= \\"Alfred D. Barksdale, captain, 116th Infantry. For repeated acts of extraordinary heroism in action near Samogneux, France, October 8, 1918; near Molleville, France, October 12; and in the Bois de la Grand Montagne, France, October 15, 1918. Commanding a support company during the attack of October 8, Capt. Barksdale discovered that his battalion had advanced ahead of the unit on the right flank, and was suffering heavy losses from machine gun fire. Without orders he attacked and captured the guns, taking many prisoners. On October 12 he worked for over an hour, exposed to a terrific bombardment, binding the wounds of his men. On October 15 he advanced alone in a thick wood and, with the aid of his pistol, put out of action a destructive machine gun which was pouring such a deadly fire his men could not raise their heads.\\" =University of Virginia presentation= At the centennial ceremonies for the University of Virginia, Captain Barksdale on behalf of the alumni presented the University with a plaque listing the names of 80 graduates killed in World War I. Virginia lawyer, state senator and judge Barksdale returned to private practice in Lynchburg from 1922 to 1938. He aligned with the Byrd Organization, and won election to the Senate of Virginia, representing the 12th Virginia senatorial district (then Lynchburg and Campbell County and still a part-time position) from 1924 to 1928.Leonard pp. 630, 635 Following the Great Depression, the Virginia General Assembly elected Barksdale as Judge of the Virginia Circuit Court for the Sixth Judicial Circuit, where his father had served for so many years, and he served from 1938 to 1940. Federal judicial service Barksdale received a recess appointment from President Franklin D. Roosevelt on December 19, 1939, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia vacated by Judge Armistead Mason Dobie. He was nominated to the same position by President Roosevelt on January 11, 1940. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 1, 1940, and received his commission on February 5, 1940. He assumed senior status on August 1, 1957. His service terminated on August 16, 1972, due to his death. Assigned a school desegregation case involving Pulaski County, which had no high school for black students, but three secondary schools for white students, as well as manifestly unequal elementary schools, Barksdale insisted that no two schools are ever precisely equal, and that the arguments of Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill concerning desegregation would be the death knell for consolidated high schools (black students were bused up to sixty miles per day to attend a training academy in Christiansburg). The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals soon reversed him in 1949, which stunned the Richmond News Leader, which printed an editorial by Douglas Southall Freeman acknowledging that 44 Virginia counties and cities had no accredited black high school. Personal life Barksdale married Louisa Estill WInfree on December 15, 1934, and they had two daughters.Halifacts p. 198  Death and legacy  Barksdale died on August 16, 1972 in Lynchburg, and is buried at its historic Spring Hill cemetery.findagrave no.9170755 His wartime papers from his World War I service are held by the VMI library, and those from his federal judicial service are held by the University of Virginia library.

The band, commonly known by the initials APTBS, play a heavy, atmospheric Wall of Sound‚Äìinfluenced blend of psychedelic rock, shoegaze and space rock. History =Early days= A Place to Bury Strangers were formed in 2002 by David Goffan and Tim Gregorio. Current frontman and guitarist Ackermann had moved to New York following the disbanding of his previous group, Skywave, to join APTBS, and become the primary songwriter after the departure of Goffan. They played their first show at Luxx in Brooklyn in 2003. Jason \\"Jay Space\\" Weilmeister and Jonathan \\"Jono Mofo\\" Smith, both from the New York City-based band Mofo, joined the band when Gregorio left. In 2006, APTBS self-released three different EPs, handmade with different color schemes: Breathe, Missing You and Never Going Down. In 2006, APTBS gained acclaim following their Webster Hall performance with the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The band returned to Webster Hall in 2007 to play with one of their major influences, the Jesus and Mary Chain. Throughout these formative years, the band's live shows became increasingly chaotic, which earned them the title of New York City's \\"loudest band\\" from various indie reviewers and bloggers, as well as \\"the most ear-shatteringly loud garage/shoegaze band you'll ever hear\\" by The Washington Post. The New York Times applauded their revival of \\"the ominous, feedback-drenched drones of the 1980s\\". =First album and touring= In 2007, Jon Whitney from the Killer Pimp label wrote the contract for their first album, A Place to Bury Strangers, on a napkin. In August 2007, the band gained national attention after a favorable Pitchfork review of this album. In 2007, the band joined Black Rebel Motorcycle Club on the \\"Holy Fuck\\" tour. In April 2008, it was announced that APTBS would open for Nine Inch Nails on several dates of the latter's US tour. Following several UK gigs, the first album was issued in the UK in October 2008 by Rocket Girl, and they received strong praise from the British media including NME and Kerrang!. In November 2008, the band returned to Europe and the UK on tour supporting MGMT. =Exploding Head= In early 2009, APTBS signed to Mute Records. The band also announced another European tour and appearances at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Seaport Music Festival and Siren Music Festival. Their second album, Exploding Head, was released by Mute in October 2009. In spring 2010, Smith decided to leave APTBS for personal reasons rather than participate in their US tour supporting the Big Pink. He was replaced for that spring tour by Lunadon, formerly of the bands the D4 and the True Lovers. On July 5, 2010, APTBS visited Bogot√°, Colombia for the first time, and played at Rock al Parque, the largest free rock festival in South America. =Worship= On February 14, 2011, Ackermann stated that the band had begun working on their third full-length album. On January 10, 2012, A Place to Bury Strangers released an all-Hipstamatic video shot on an iPhone for the song \\"So Far Away\\" from the Onwards to the Wall EP. On February 12, 2012, the band announced that Robi Gonzalez had replaced Weilmeister as drummer. On May 2, 2012, it was announced that the band's third album, Worship, was scheduled for release on the Dead Oceans label, on June 11 in the UK and Europe and on June 26, 2012 in the US. The band announced plans to support the release with a full North American tour in October 2012. =Strange Moon and Transfixiation= In early March 2013, APTBS announced that they had recorded covers of songs by Portland band Dead Moon for release on Record Store Day 2013 as an EP titled Strange Moon. Gonzalez decided to retire from touring, and during the subsequent 2016 tour, John Fedowitz (Skywave, Ceremony) played drums for the band. In March 2013, the band began recording their fourth studio album, Transfixiation. They recorded for several days at ABC Studios in Etne, Norway, with Emil Nikolaisen of Serena Maneesh. The album was released on February 17, 2015 on Dead Oceans. =Pinned= In February 2018, the band announced that Lia Simone Braswell would be a permanent replacement for Gonzalez as the band's drummer. Their fifth studio album, Pinned, was released on April 13.

Named for counties in Iowa and Virginia, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Initially known only as LST-1076, the ship was deactivated following the war. Renamed Page County in 1955, the ship was reactivated in 1960 and saw service during the Vietnam War. Decommissioned in 1971, Page County was transferred to the Hellenic Navy and renamed Kriti. Her fate is unknown. Service history Originally laid down as LST-1076 on 16 March 1945 by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Hingham, Massachusetts, the ship was launched on 14 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Lillian J. Ostler. LST-1076 was commissioned on 1 May 1945, with Lieutenant Grover L. Rawlings, USNR, in command. After shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, LST‚Äì1076 embarked troops in New York and sailed, 14 June 1945, for Pearl Harbor. She arrived Pearl Harbor on 19 July and began several weeks of rigorous training in the Hawaiian operating areas. LST‚Äì1076 stood out from Pearl Harbor on 29 August loaded with occupation troops bound for Sasebo, Japan. She disembarked her passengers on 22 September and by 17 October, she was returning to the United States with war veterans. She arrived at San Diego on 11 December and shortly thereafter went into overhaul. LST‚Äì1076 was sent to Vancouver, Washington in April 1946 for inactivation, and decommissioned on 13 June to be assigned to the Columbia Group of the U.S. Pacific Reserve Fleet. =1960-1966= Named USS Page County (LST-1076) on 1 July 1955 the LST remained at Astoria, Oregon on the Columbia River until July 1960 when she was towed to San Diego for modernization and reactivation. Page County was recommissioned on 28 November 1960 and following shakedown carried out local operations off the coast of Southern California through 1961. On 3 January 1962 Page County sailed for Pearl Harbor to provide logistic support for the United States Army. Page County operated within the Hawaiian Islands in support of the Army through January and shifted to operational control of Commander, Hawaiian Sea Frontier on 1 February for operations in the southern mid-Pacific. On 1 April she was assigned to Joint Task Force 8 in support of nuclear tests being conducted by the U.S. Government. She transported civilian construction crews and their equipment to islands such as Palmyra, Malden, Penrhyn, Washington, Fanning, and Christmas. She completed these assignments on 5 August and returned to San Diego on the 20th. On 27 October Page County was called on to participate in the Cuban Missile Crisis quarantine. She transited the Panama Canal on 8 November and reached Vieques, Puerto Rico on the 16th. After shuttling troops between Roosevelt Roads and Vieques, she was detached on 1 December to return to San Diego. On 16 March 1963 Page County put into San Francisco to undergo an extensive MK II FRAM overhaul which was completed in July. She returned to San Diego on 5 August and was assigned to coastal operations. Between 18 January and 16 February 1965 she participated in \\"Operation Silver Lance\\" (one of the largest Navy-Marine Corps training exercises ever held in peacetime). Deteriorating conditions in Vietnam caused her immediate departure on 17 February, for Pearl Harbor, to transport elements of Marine Air Group 13 to Okinawa. She returned to San Diego on 7 May. =Vietnam, 1966-1970= Page County deployed to Adak, Alaska from 6 July to 21 October, returning to San Diego for coastal operations until 19 July 1966, when she prepared for deployment to Vietnam. Operating principally between Chu Lai, Da Nang, and also helped land the Army on the beach of Nha Trang, she supported the struggle in South Vietnam until returning to the United States in mid- December. Resuming local operations, Page County provided services to MiD Pac in evaluating the capabilities of LSTs for mine sweeping, and to Pacific Fleet Command for training exercises and administrative lifts for Hawaiian-based Army and Marine Corps personnel. Early 1968 found Page County participating in EastPac exercises, training Camp Pendleton Marines and Seabees from Port Hueneme. During the spring she again joined the 7th Fleet for operations in Southeast Asia. From 11 September through 6 November she operated out of Da Nang and returned to San Diego on 24 December, via Hong Kong, Yokosuka, and Pearl Harbor. After operations on the West Coast, Page County returned to the Western Pacific in the autumn and served in the 7th Fleet into 1970. =Greek service= Decommissioned on 5 March 1971, she was transferred to Greece (date unknown) under the Security Assistance Program and renamed Kriti (L171). The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 April 1978 and sold under the Security Assistance Program to Greece on 1 July 1978. Her final fate is unknown. Awards Page County earned five campaign stars for Vietnam War service.

In typical usage of the term, the ABD graduate student has completed the required preparatory coursework, passed any required preliminary, comprehensive, doctoral qualifying examinations, and met all other requirements except for the research requirements, typically including the writing and defense of a dissertation. The informal ABD designation also indicates that someone is no longer simply a doctoral student, but rather has formally upgraded their status to a doctoral candidate and has entered the most advanced phase of their research and dissertation development. A student attaining this level also may be granted a formal Candidate in Philosophy degree or status at a few institutions. Some universities, including Columbia, Yale, and George Washington, may award a formal Master of Philosophy (MPhil) degree for these achievements. The use of ABD or the similar PhD(c) for PhD candidate (also PhD-c or PhDc) as a credential has been criticized as potentially misleading by some writers as the terms are not widely understood outside of academia or indeed outside of the US.

In the branch of mathematics known as order theory, a semimodular lattice, is a lattice that satisfies the following condition: ;Semimodular law: a ‚àß b <: a implies b <: a ‚à® b. The notation a <: b means that b covers a, i.e. a < b and there is no element c such that a < c < b. An atomistic (hence algebraic) semimodular bounded lattice is called a matroid lattice because such lattices are equivalent to (simple) matroids. An atomistic semimodular bounded lattice of finite length is called a geometric lattice and corresponds to a matroid of finite rank.These definitions follow Stern (1999). Some authors use the term geometric lattice for the more general matroid lattices. But most authors only deal with the finite case, in which both definitions are equivalent to semimodular and atomistic. Semimodular lattices are also known as upper semimodular lattices; the dual notion is that of a lower semimodular lattice. A finite lattice is modular if and only if it is both upper and lower semimodular. A finite lattice, or more generally a lattice satisfying the ascending chain condition or the descending chain condition, is semimodular if and only if it is M-symmetric. Some authors refer to M-symmetric lattices as semimodular lattices.For instance Fofanova (2001). Birkhoff's condition A lattice is sometimes called weakly semimodular if it satisfies the following condition due to Garrett Birkhoff: ;Birkhoff's condition: If a ‚àß b <: a and a ‚àß b <: b, :then a <: a ‚à® b and b <: a ‚à® b. Every semimodular lattice is weakly semimodular. The converse is true for lattices of finite length, and more generally for upper continuous (meets distribute over joins of chains) relatively atomic lattices. Mac Lane's condition The following two conditions are equivalent to each other for all lattices. They were found by Saunders Mac Lane, who was looking for a condition that is equivalent to semimodularity for finite lattices, but does not involve the covering relation. ;Mac Lane's condition 1: For any a, b, c such that b ‚àß c < a < c < b ‚à® a, :there is an element d such that b ‚àß c < d ‚â§ b and a = (a ‚à® d) ‚àß c. ;Mac Lane's condition 2: For any a, b, c such that b ‚àß c < a < c < b ‚à® c, :there is an element d such that b ‚àß c < d ‚â§ b and a = (a ‚à® d) ‚àß c. Every lattice satisfying Mac Lane's condition is semimodular. The converse is true for lattices of finite length, and more generally for relatively atomic lattices. Moreover, every upper continuous lattice satisfying Mac Lane's condition is M-symmetric. Notes References * . (The article is about M-symmetric lattices.) * .

The Husaynis follow the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, in contrast to the Shafi school followed by most of the Arab Muslim population of Palestine.The Rise and Fall of the Husainis Pappe, Ilan. Institute of Jerusalem Studies History Kamil al-Husayni was the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammad Amin al-Husayni was the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and President of the Supreme Muslim Council Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni led Palestinian irregular forces against the Haganah and other Jewish militias during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. He died in combat in al-Qastal. The Husaynis migrated to Jerusalem in the 12th century after Saladin drove out the Crusaders from the city and much of the Levant. The Husaynis were a major force in rebelling against Muhammad Ali who governed Egypt and Palestine in defiance of the Ottoman Empire. This solidified a cooperative relationship with the returning Ottoman authority. The clan took part in fighting the Qaisi tribe in an alliance with a rural lord of the Jerusalem area Mustafa Abu Ghosh, who clashed with the tribe frequently. The feuds gradually occurred in the city between the clan and the Khalidis that led the Qaisis, however these conflicts dealt with city positions and not Qaisi-Yamani rivalry. The Husaynis later led opposition and propaganda movements against the Young Turks who controlled the Ottoman Empire. By the time of the British Mandate the clan had hundreds of members and its several branches encompassed thousands. They were mostly concentrated in the Old City, however a large number of clan members also lived in the neighborhoods of Sheikh Jarrah, the German Colony, Katamon, Baka and Musrara. Several members of the clan were appointed to important political positions such as Mayor and Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Musa al- Husayni was mayor of Jerusalem, 1918‚Äì1920. Mohammed Tahir al-Husayni was Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, 1860s-1908, followed by his son Kamil al-Husayni, 1908-1921, and then another son Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, 1921-1937. The main political rivals for the clan was the Nashashibi clan of Jerusalem, especially during the Mandate period. Before the formal commencement of the British Mandate, Musa and Amin al-Husayni incited the 1920 Palestine riots, resulting in many deaths. As a result, Musa was replaced as mayor by the head of the rival Nashashibi clan. Amin al-Husayni and Aref al-Aref were arrested, but when they were let out on bail they both escaped to Syria. A military court sentenced Amin in absentia to 10 years imprisonment,. and he failed to qualify for a general amnesty in early 1921 because of his absence. Unlike the Nashashibi clan, many Husayni clan members continued to lead opposition and propaganda movements against the British Mandate government and early Zionist immigrants. The clan founded and led many Palestinian Arab Islamist groups such as the Palestine Arab Party and the Arab Higher Committee. The clan was directly involved in disturbances including the 1920 Palestine riots and the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. As a result of continuing disturbances and violence, the Arab Higher Committee was outlawed in October 1937 and Arab national leaders were rounded up by the British. One member of the clan, Amin al-Husayni, escaped arrest by fleeing to Syria. During World War II he went to Iraq then Iran and eventually to Italy and eventually arrived in Berlin. In Berlin, Amin al-Husayni was photographed with many important Nazi leaders including Adolf Hitler and Amin al-Husayni went to the Balkans on behalf of the Nazis to give speeches to recruits of the 13th Waffen SS division. Amin al-Husayni also broadcast pro-Axis statements into the Middle East on Nazi radio stations. During 1947 Palestinian Civil War, the clan formed the Holy War Army led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama.Hourani, Albert Habib, Philip S. Khoury, and Mary C. Wilson. (2005).

The Holy War Army was also active during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and Abd al-Qadir al- Husayni died in combat on 8 April 1948 at Qastal. After the 1948 War, most of the clan relocated to Jordan and the Gulf States. Many family heads that remained in the Old City and the northern neighborhoods of East Jerusalem fled due to hostilities with the Israeli government.

It premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on October 17, 2007.Episode guide. South Park Studios. Retrieved on 2008-11-07. The episode was rated TV-MA LV in the United States. It is the first episode in a three- part story arc that won the 2008 Emmy for \\"Outstanding Animated Program for One Hour or More\\". The three episodes were later reissued together, along with previously unreleased footage, as the uncensored Imaginationland: The Movie. In the episode, Cartman swears that he has seen a leprechaun. Then, Stan and Kyle visit \\"Imaginationland\\", a land with imaginary beings.  Plot summary  The episode begins with Cartman directing the other boys through a forest in search of a leprechaun. A skeptical Kyle is there, having made a bet that if Cartman can prove leprechauns exist, Kyle will suck Cartman's balls, but if not, Cartman will owe Kyle $10. To Kyle's shock, they do spot a leprechaun and give chase. They eventually and successfully catch it in a trap. The leprechaun says he was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, and that being chased by the boys has made him late, before vanishing. A triumphant Cartman declares that Kyle must now suck his balls, but Kyle initially refuses, asking why a leprechaun would be warning of a terrorist attack and insisting that there has to be a logical explanation. The next day, as Kyle is conversing with Stan, Kenny, Jimmy and Butters, a strange man suddenly appears, asking them if they have seen the leprechaun. When Kyle argues that leprechauns are just imaginary, the man tells him that just because something is imaginary doesn't mean it is not real. He then invites the boys for a ride in his magical \\"Imagination Flying Machine\\" while he serenades them with \\"The Imagination Song\\" (consisting simply of the word 'imagination' sung repetitively in various tonal inflection). The group arrives in a place called Imaginationland, where all the beings created by human imagination reside. The imaginary creatures are all fascinated by the presence of \\"creators\\", and ask them about the leprechaun. At that moment a band of Islamist terrorists suddenly appear and set off a series of bombs, which kill hundreds of the imaginary creatures and destroy most of the city, with Stan watching. The boys flee on the back of Draco who flies them to safety. Butters, however, gets left behind, and he and the surviving imaginary characters are taken hostage by the terrorists. The next morning, Kyle wakes up in his bed, and is at first sure the whole thing might have been a dream ‚Äî until he calls Stan who tells him the same story. They also discover that Butters is missing, much to his parents' shock. Meanwhile, Cartman, angry that Kyle has refused to fulfill his part of their agreement, takes Kyle to court, where the judge sees the contract Kyle signed and orders Kyle to suck Cartman's balls within twenty- four hours or he will be arrested. The United States Department of Defense has received a video from the terrorists, which shows they are holding the survivors of the attack hostage, including Butters. Butters reads a note from the terrorists at gunpoint, and cries out to Stan and Kyle as the video ends. Unsure of how to counter the terrorists, they turn to Hollywood, hoping that they can use their creativity to get ideas. After being disappointed by several directors, including M. Night Shyamalan, who could only come up with twist endings, and Michael Bay, who could only come up with special effects sequences, they seek the advice of Mel Gibson, who suggests that they examine the video the terrorists sent and determine if there is anyone in it that somehow doesn't fit. The officials at the Pentagon immediately perform a background check on the video and realize that Butters is not an imaginary character. The general orders his men to locate both Stan and Kyle. In Imaginationland, the terrorists take one of the creatures, \\"Rockety Rocket\\", and launch him at \\"the Barrier\\", the wall that separates the good and evil halves of Imaginationland. Despite Butters' attempts to stop them, the terrorists destroy the wall and unleash the evil imaginary creatures. Cartman, meanwhile, dons a Sultan's robe and throws a huge party, during which the other kids will watch Kyle suck his balls. Kyle has resigned himself to the task, and is about to walk into Cartman's house with Stan when members of the military arrive and take them away for questioning about Imaginationland. Cartman screams in anger about his plan being foiled, then quickly leaves home and hitchhikes with a trucker to Washington, D.C. to force Kyle to fulfill his end of the bet. He ends the episode stating, \\"Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls.\\" Production Production for the episode began in July 2007, nearly three months before the final airing. This was uncharacteristic for South Park, as most episodes are produced in one week or less. The original intention was to make the story into a feature-length film, created as a theatrically released sequel to South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, but there were myriad factors that led it to becoming a regular episode: they didn't feel it was a \\"big\\" enough idea, and the usage of licensed characters made it feel derivative. In addition, the driving schedule of producing new episodes contributed to its adoption as a mid-season show. On the Monday preceding this episode's broadcast, Parker decided to make the episode a trilogy. Stone felt it fun to create a three-parter, as many television dramas at that time‚Äî24, Lost‚Äîwere based on serialization. The day after \\"Imaginationland Episode I\\" aired, Parker completed the rest of the trilogy's story in a swift fashion: \\"I remember that Thursday morning writing every beat of the show on the board. It was the first time on a Thursday I stepped back from the board and the whole show was there. It felt so good.\\" Shortly after \\"Imaginationland\\" was originally broadcast, the site also featured T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode. It featured Butters in a floating bubble, asking \\"Do I have to be the key?\\" Reception and release Episode I had over 3.4 million viewers and was the most watched program in all of television for Wednesday night among men between ages 18‚Äì24 and 34-49 and ranked #1 in cable among persons 18-49. IGN gave the episode a rating of 9.1/10 and praised it for being \\"smart, inventive and provides a number of moments that'll stick with you long after it's over\\". 411Mania also gave the show a positive review, calling it \\"a great episode\\", praising it as an improvement over what the site perceived to be two weak episodes, and awarding it 7/10. TV Squad also gave a positive review saying that \\"They're still on a roll with another great episode.\\" Josh Modell of The A.V. Club gave the trilogy a B grade, criticizing the slow pace of the main plot and calling it \\"more like an excuse for a nostalgia trip than a good arc.\\" However, he praised Cartman's endless pursuit of his bet with Kyle and the return of the Christmas critters, calling their appearance, \\"some of the funniest moments in South Park's recent history,\\" The Imaginationland Trilogy won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming One Hour or More). \\"Imaginationland Episode I\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's eleventh season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 12, 2008. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.  Cultural references  The Mayor of Imaginationland is a pastiche of two characters. Aspects of his appearance and the \\"Imagination Song\\" allude to both Dreamfinder from Disney's Journey into Imagination and to Mr. Sophistication from The Killing of a Chinese Bookie. The scene after the bomb goes off in Imaginationland, silently showing the devastation, is a parody of the beach storming scene in Saving Private Ryan.http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/south-park/257956/south-park- the-25-greatest-and-geekiest-episodes The creators used the TV shows 24 and Battlestar Galactica as templates for plotting the structure of the trilogy.http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movie-reviews/2008/03/13/TV-on-DVD- Stargate-The-Ark-of-Truth-and-South-Park-Imaginationland/stories/200803130457  Film  South Park: Imaginationland, or Imaginationland: The Movie, is all three episodes merged into a compilation film. The movie is uncensored and includes previously unreleased footage. It was released direct-to-video in March 2008 for the United States and a year later in the United Kingdom in May 2009.http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/26/south-park-imaginationland- uncensored-directors-cut-dvd-review A few months later the movie was released for free online as a streaming video.South Park Studio News.

The video is available here For reference, the DVD includes two bonus full-length episodes from previous seasons, \\"Woodland Critter Christmas\\" and \\"ManBearPig\\", as they feature the imaginary characters that reappeared in this film. Shortly after \\"Imaginationland\\" was originally broadcast, the website featured T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode. It featured Butters in a floating bubble, asking \\"Do I have to be the key?\\" Having a theme of good versus evil, the compilation movie (or the trilogy story arc) parodies fairy tales, fantasy films and horror films, and includes their affiliated superheros, supervillains and legendary creatures. Being a social satire of events, the movie also lampoons the American military, American politics, movie directors, hippie culture and the mass media regarding terrorism.

In addition to its football side the club had departments for athletics, badminton, basketball, dance and rhythmic gymnastics. The merger of the three clubs made SV the second-largest club in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania with some 1400 members. The club had a strong focus on youth football and had links to a number of area schools. It also had a DFB-affiliated training centre and had sent on several players to FC Hansa Rostock and state select teams.

The family landed the boat to retrieve the deer and were ambushed by ten Native Americans, who were hiding in the canebrake. The first to board the boat was killed by Mrs. Barnard with an axe. Mr. Barnard shot and killed two before he was killed. The son, James, ran away with a corn knife, pursued by two. When one fell behind, James turned to fight and the last pursuer fled.

The sculpture was commissioned by Brian Maxwell of Powerbar the Maxwell Family Foundation for the late environmentalist David Brower and its name was often used by Brower referring to mankind traveling through life in a common vehicle. Today the sculpture is located at Kennesaw State University adjacent to the Social Science building, the first LEED-certified building at the University System of Georgia. The 175-ton chunk of rock was formed from 88 individual pieces of quartzite and bonded with specially made polyepoxide. After these pieces were in place, Eino attached a life-size bronze model of the late Brower. Additionally, 2,400 bronze pieces were added to the exterior to outline land masses on the earth. Spaceship Earth was completed in August 2006 and unveiled in October. The sculpture broke apart and started spilling over just two months later. First reports cited poor adhesive and unsound construction contributed to its demise while Eino argued that it had to have been an act of vandalism. The sculpture was rededicated in November 2006. History A few months before the November 2000 death of the first Executive Director Sierra Club and lifelong environmentalist David Brower, the founders of PowerBar, Brian and Jennifer Maxwell, commissioned the 175-ton tribute in his honor. It was during a morning run with photographer Galen Rowell and PowerBar's Brian Maxwell that the tribute was conceived. Shortly after Maxwell met with his friend, environmentalist and Finnish-American artist Eino, to create such a sculpture. Eino was sent stone samples from a rock quarry in Brazil at the start of the project and \\"[he] thought, oh my, this is three times harder than marble. But immediately I understood this was the right stone. It is more permanent than anything else. No pollution can hurt it. No graffiti will harm it. It was the right stone to be here for 1,000 years.\\" Over 175 tons of Brazilian blue quartzite was shipped and stored in a parking lot while Eino and Maxwell sought to secure a home for the sculpture. Locations in Berkeley to Washington, D.C., were proposed, but all were turned down by local art commissions or city councils. For nearly a year, Eino argued to have the sculpture placed in the streets of San Francisco, but the San Francisco Arts Commission‚Äôs Visual Arts Committee turned it down by saying it \\"not only had little or nothing to do with the city\\" but \\"was too big and did not represent Brower's ideals.\\" Later, in 2004, Jennifer Maxwell, then the widow of Brian Maxwell, contacted the City of Berkeley to find a home for the tribute. A few members of the Berkeley Arts Commission spoke out against the sculpture's design and how it seemed to be forced on the city. In October 2004, the commission voted 7-2 to accept the sculpture with conditions. For final approval by the Civic Art Commission sculpture could not be adorned with the bronze statue of Brower, and the Maxwell family had to pay the entire installation cost. By 2005, with a push from the Mayor, the Civic Art Commission found nearly 30 different locations the sculpture could live. In August 2005, two Berkeley area commissions voted to consider another location. While negotiations were dragging on with bureaucrats in Berkeley, officials at Kennesaw State University contacted Eino and accepted the memorial. Today the sculpture resides at Kennesaw State University, adjacent to the Social Science building. Nearly six years after its conception, Spaceship Earth was finished and unveiled on October 20, 2006. In late December 2006, only three months after its installation on campus, Spaceship Earth collapsed. The sculpture was intended to be a permanent reminder to future generations to take care of their delicate planet. After the collapse, Eino attributed the disaster to vandalism, but later reports associated the collapse with poor construction. Reconstruction was to begin in February 2007 but was delayed until July and was completed by November 2007. Image:Fallin Spaceship Earth.JPG Image of Spaceship Earth days after its 2006 collapse.

He served as the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury from 2001 to 2011, first appointed by Liberal Party Treasurer Peter Costello in April 2001, reappointed by Costello in 2006, and retained by the Rudd government. He chaired the Australia's Future Tax System Review, informally known as the Henry Tax Review, which was published in 2010. He retired in March 2011, and on 1 June 2011 was appointed as Special Advisor to the Prime Minister. He chaired the committee which produced a White Paper on \\"Australia in the Asian Century\\", released in mid-2012. Henry is the chairman of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the Sir Roland Wilson Foundation at the Australian National University, and is the outgoing chairman of the National Australia Bank. Education and early career Ken Henry studied economics at the University of New South Wales, graduating in 1979. After, he lectured in economics at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand while studying for his Doctor of Philosophy degree at the same institution.https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/4887 From September 1986 to June 1991, Dr Henry worked as a senior adviser to the Labor Treasurer, Paul Keating, providing advice on taxation policy and administration, retirement incomes policy, industry policy and microeconomic reform (including telecommunications reform). In June 1991 he returned to the Treasury, becoming head of the Microeconomic Modelling Unit. In July 1992 he took up the position of Minister-Counsellor (Economic and Financial Affairs) in the Australian Delegation to the OECD in Paris. During this time, he has served as an Australian representative to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (1992‚Äì94). He was the Treasury department secretary from April 2001 until March 2011; and therefore an ex-officio member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Henry remained head of Treasury in the transition from Liberal to Labor Governments in 2007. In 2008 he headed Australia's Future Tax System Review Panel, charged with examining all aspects of the Australian tax system with a view to reform. Treasury =Climate change= In 2004, Henry recommended a National Emissions Trading Scheme to thwart climate change, however the advice at the time was ignored. His recommendations have since been praised. =Consumption tax modelling= Ken Henry has been criticised for his role in modelling the Hewson Liberal opposition reform package known as Fightback!. That package contained as a central element a goods and services tax, similar to both the Option C developed by Henry for the Hawke Labor government in 1985, and the GST developed for the Howard Liberal Government in 1997. Henry rejects the claim that Treasury acted improperly, saying \\"We rejected that charge at the time. I would always reject it. There was nothing improper in what we did.\\" He did concede, however that \\"it is the case that our work was used by the Government to attack publicly an Opposition policy.\\"* In reference to the Option C modelling he had previously worked on, Henry said: When Fightback! came out, the model the team had developed enabled the identification of a major failing in the package. Income tax bracket creep had been used to fund the package but bracket creep had not been used in the analysis of the after tax income various taxpayers would receive. Treasury was accused by the Coalition of having acted improperly. =Pre 2007 election speech= In April 2007, the Australian Financial Review's Laura Tingle ran a story about Henry's semi- annual speech to staff. In the wake of the Howard Government's development of an A$10 billion policy proposal, Henry was reported as saying that there was a 'greater than usual risk of the development of policy proposals that are, frankly, bad' in the lead-up to the federal election.' Former Howard Government ministers suggested that it was a deliberate attempt to have Henry's critical views aired publicly to the detriment of the Howard Government, and called it 'a deliberate piece of political positioning by Henry' prior to the 2007 federal election. Following the initial controversy, Henry released the full text of the speech, along with clarification. It said, in part, that: > The Government, our ministers and other agencies are under no compulsion to > rely on our advice. In respect of water, that point is all too obvious. We > are competing for influence with other central agencies, line agencies and > independent policy advisers, such as think-tanks, commentators and > consultants.... As I have noted on other occasions, I have never known the > Treasurer to not welcome frank and honest advice when it is provided in- > confidence and in good faith. =Bank Deposit Guarantee Scheme= Immediately prior to Henry's appearance at a Senate hearing into the Rudd Government's unlimited Bank Deposit Guarantee Scheme, an email from the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, to Henry was reported on in the media. No text was published, however the Australian newspaper alleged that the email expressed concerns of the Reserve Bank about a 'flight to safety' caused by the unlimited guarantee of deposits in Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions, and the consequent loss of liquidity in secondary credit markets. It claimed that Stevens called for a cap on the amount of a deposit guarantee ‚Äò...the lower the better' and that he also said 'If this situation is allowed to continue, foreign bank branches will not be able to source funding in the local market as a flight to guaranteed deposits occurs.' In the Senate hearing, Henry denied there had been any disagreement between Treasury and the Reserve Bank, and that the two bodies were ‚Äòof one mind‚Äô on the Bank Deposit Guarantee Scheme. Henry said that the Opposition's claim that Mr Rudd had ignored Reserve Bank warnings was based on a report in The Australian newspaper. Dr Henry called that report unfortunate, fallacious, unhelpful, and \\"W-R-O-N-G\\" The Reserve Bank Governor backed Henry, stating that \\"steps in these directions, in the context of what other countries were doing, were sensible, and the RBA supports them.\\" =Stimulus package= Treasury, under Henry, gave advice supporting the Rudd Government's stimulus package, which was designed to lessen the size of an economic recession in Australia following the global financial crisis. The package has been described by Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist Joseph Stiglitz as 'one of the most impressive economic policies I've seen, ever'. The stimulus package foreshadowed $42 billion in spending measures. The classical Keynesian response embodied in the stimulus package, the desire to maintain expenditure in the economy, and the desire to avoid the destruction of human capital from a recession was encapsulated in the phrase attributed to Henry: Henry stated that the stimulus package would either reduce future Government spending or drive up taxes, but he also said that this would occur in \\"a period of faster growth in private sector activity and the judgment that has been made is that in those circumstances . . . the Government will have the ability to repay debt without doing damage to gross domestic product growth\\". Henry provided advice to the Rudd Government that without the continuation of the stimulus package, 100,000 jobs would be lost, and GDP would reduce by 1.5 percent. No modeling was made public to support either of these contentions. After the release of advice, Shadow Treasurer and Minister in the former Howard Government, Joe Hockey, commented that he had never seen a piece of Treasury advice so clearly designed to be released to the media. Further, graphs were subsequently printed in the budget papers purporting to show that there was a statistically significant correlation with the size of G20 member countries' stimulus packages and their respective economic performances, however the data had been cherry picked and only 11 G20 economies had been included in the analysis. When all G20 economies were analyzed, no correlation existed. Treasury later withdrew the graph. IMF research showed statistically significant links between the form of stimulus, and the success or otherwise of various countries through the recession. Notwithstanding this criticism, a raft of economic advice and analysis has subsequently supported Australia's actions. The OECD's 2009 employment outlook said that while \\"generally have not had a strong effect in cushioning the initial decline in employment caused by the crisis...Australia is a notable exception.\\" Australia's unemployment figures remain about 3% lower than the OECD average, and it also avoided recession throughout the GFC. Henry's advice throughout the GFC has been characterised as \\"within the mainstream of economic orthodoxy\\". As of December 2009, Australia's unemployment rate is thought to have peaked at 5.8 percent after several months of job growth. This is much lower than previous Treasury estimates of up to 8.5 percent. =Henry Tax Review= The Australian Government released the contents of the Henry Tax Review on 2 May 2010. The review proposed changes to superannuation, a resource rent tax on the mining sector and tax reform for small businesses. The Resource Super Profits Tax (RSPT) proposed by Henry proposed to tax the super profits of mining companies. Following criticisms of the measures proposed in the Henry Tax Review, Henry said: > Whenever an idea is ventured publicly by a person, whether that person is a > policy advisor or whether it's a government minister, there's at least a > handful of academics who will contest it. I've seen it on both sides of > politics - this is not a partisan comment at all - but for governments, > government ministers who are seeking to get ideas legislated - it is > unbelievably frustrating, incredibly frustrating. But I think there are > occasions on which economists might, at least for a period, put down their > weapons and join a consensus. Henry was criticized for wanting to avoid debate of his ideas. =Resource Super Profits Tax= Ken Henry proposed a Resource Super Profits Tax (RSPT) on all mining companies' super profits. The government claimed that miners paid as little as 17 percent tax on their profits, mining companies claimed they paid 43%, but Australian Taxation Office figures indicate that \\"the average tax take across the mining industry is about 27 percent\\" with many paying much less than this. During negotiations with mining companies, Henry advised that the initial estimates of A$12 billion had been revised up to A$24 billion due to higher commodity price estimates in the two months since the release of the initial RSPT proposal. Post-Treasury career =Special Adviser to the Prime Minister= On 1 June 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced Henry had been appointed by the Governor General as a Special Adviser on a part-time basis in her portfolio. He was directly appointed by the Governor General under section 67 of the Constitution of Australia, and outside the Public Service Act 1999. \\"Australia in the Asian Century\\" Henry led the writing of a White Paper on the topic \\"Australia in the Asian Century\\", publicly released in mid-2012. He was assisted by Professor Peter Drysdale, Catherine Livingstone, Chair of Telstra, and John Denton, CEO of Corrs Chambers Westgarth. Dr Gordon de Brouwer, Dr David Gruen, Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Treasury and Dr Heather Smith, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade form a Secretariat. =National Australia Bank= Henry was appointed as an executive director of the National Australia Bank (NAB) in 2011; and in 2015 was appointed as Chairman. Under Henry, NAB received the largest ever vote of 88.1 percent against its remuneration report. Appearing before the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry in November 2018, Henry was defensive, with some tense exchanges with Counsel Assisting, Rowena Orr. In his final report, Royal Commissioner The Honourable Justice Kenneth Hayne singled out Henry and NAB for particular criticism: On 5 February 2019, NAB announced to the ASX that Henry acknowledged the Commissioner's comments and he seemed unwilling to accept criticism. He denied that this was the case. Two days later Henry announced that he would resign as chairman after overseeing the selection of his replacement. =Other= Henry was also appointed a director of the board of the Australian Securities Exchange in January 2013. He is chair of the Sir Roland Wilson Foundation Board at the Australian National University. Henry is the part-time Executive Chair of the Australian National University's new Institute of Public Policy; and chair of the SMART Infrastructure Facility Advisory Council at the University of Wollongong. =Activism= In 2011, Henry joined the council of Voiceless, the animal protection institute. \\"There are few pursuits more noble in life than giving voice to those who would otherwise suffer in silence.\\" He proudly proclaims his rural upbringing around Taree as contributing to his early realisation about the value of conservation and animal rights. He has a specific interest in the preservation of the endangered Hairy-nosed wombat. Awards and honours In 2007 Henry was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for service to the development and implementation of economic and taxation policy, to the finance sector through a range of banking and regulatory bodies, and to the community in the area of welfare and care of native wildlife, and received the Centenary Medal in 2001.

The order, which was previously considered a suborder of Perciformes, is made up of about 2,211 species that are divided between seven families. Phylogenetic relationships of the Gobiiformes have been elucidated using molecular data. Gobiiforms are primarily small species that live in marine water, but roughly 10% of these species inhabit fresh water. This order is composed chiefly of benthic or burrowing species; like many other benthic fishes, most gobiiforms do not have a gas bladder or any other means of controlling their buoyancy in water, so they must spend most of their time on or near the bottom. Gobiiformes means \\"Goby-like\\". Families The 5th Edition of the Fishes of the World reclassified the former superfamily Goboidei as the order Gobiiformes and also rearranged the families within the order compared to the previous edition. The largest change is that the Oxudercidae and the Gobiidae are split into two families, with the Oxudercidae containing the species formerly classified as the Gobiidae subfamilies Amblyopinae, Gobionellinae, Oxudercinae and Sicydiinae while merging the families Kraemeriidae, Microdesmidae, Ptereleotridae and Schindleriidae into the family Gobiidae, though no subfamilies within the Gobiidae were proposed. Under this classification system the Gobiiformes is divided into the following families: =Rhyacichthyidae= The loach-gobies are a small family, with only three species split between two genera, which inhabits marine and fresh water in Oceania and the western Pacific. These are thought to be among the more primitive species of the Gobiiformes. =Odontobutidae= The Odontobutidae, or freshwater sleepers, contains 22 species between 6 genera from eastern Asia. This family is the sister to all the other Gobiiformes in a clade with the Rhyacichthyidae. =Milyeringidae= The Milyeringidae contains two genera of cave fish, one in Western Australia and one at the other side of the Indian Ocean in Madagascar; both genera contain three recognized species. This family forms a second clade of the Gobiiformes. =Eleotridae= The sleeper gobies are a family of twenty six genera and 126 species found in freshawater and mangrove habitats throughout the tropical and temperate parts of the world as far north as the eastern United States and as far south as Stewart Island, New Zealand, except for the eastern Atlantic. Fossils of Eleotrid gobies are known from the Late Oligocene. The families Milyeringidae and Butidae were formerly classified as subfamilies of the Eleotridae but are not found to be close to the Eleotridae senus stricto in this system. =Butidae= The Butidae are one of the two families which are given the common name \\"sleeper gobies\\", and indeed were formerly classified as subfamily of the traditional sleeper goby family Eleotridae, although some phylogenies have placed them closer to the Oxucerdidae and the Gobiidae than to the Eleotridae. They are found in the Indo-Pacific and in West Africa, and contains 10 genera with 46 species split between them. =Thalasseleotrididae= The family Thalasseleotrididae is considered to be a sister group to the family Gobiidae and is separated as a family by the authors of this classification based on recent molecular studies. It comprises two genera of marine gobies from the temperate waters of Australia and New Zealand, with a total of three species between them. =Oxucerdidae= Oxudercidae is a family of gobies comprising species previously split between four subfamilies of the family Gobiidae. The family is sometimes referred to as the Gobionellidae, but Oxucerdidae has priority. The species in this family have a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and tropical areas and are found in marine and freshwater environments, typically in inshore, euryhaline areas with silt and sand substrates. The family contains 86 genera and about 600 species. Many species in this family can be found in fresh water and a number of species are found on wet beaches; some are able to survive for extended periods out of water, most famously the mudskippers. =Gobiidae= The Gobiidae as recognized in this classification now includes the former members of several families which other classifications have regarded as valid families. As classified in this work the family remains one of the most speciose families of marine fish, as well as being one of the most numerous groups of fishes in freshwater habitats on oceanic islands. Many species have fused pelvic fins that can be used as a suction device; some island species, such as the red-tailed stream goby (Lentipes concolor), are able to use these pelvic fins to ascend rock faces alongside waterfalls, allowing them to inhabit waters far from the ocean. Some of the species that are found in fresh water as adults spawn in the ocean and are catadromous, not unlike the eels of the family Anguillidae. With the blennies, the Gobiidae constitute a dominant part of the benthic, small fish fauna in tropical reef habitats. They are most diverse in the tropical Indo- West Pacific but the family is well represented in temperate waters in both the northern and southern hemispheres. They are mostly free living fishes found alone or in small schools, but some form associations with invertrebrates, especially in coral reefs. About 120 species are known to form such symbiotic relationships; members of the genera Amblyeleotris and Cryptocentrus, for example, cohabit in burrows with alpheid shrimps, while other species live as cleaner fish, e.g Elacatinus. They can be sequential hermaphrodites and numerous species are known to exhibit parental care. Species status The tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi) was listed as an endangered species in 1994; it is the only species of goby in the genus Eucyclogobius. E. newberryi is native to the coastal region of California, in marshes and lagoons with brackish water, predominately in waters where the salinity is less than 12 parts per thousand (ppt), but has been documented in waters with a salinity of 42 ppt. E. newberryi prefers water with mild temperatures (8 to 25 ¬∞C) and waters with a depth from 25 to 200 cm. These gobies often use thick patches of aquatic vegetation to hide in if threatened or disturbed. The average lifespan of E. newberryi is only one year. Spawning and reproduction is at its peak during spring and into late summer. However, in the southern region of its range where waters remain at a warmer temperature, E. newberryi will reproduce year round. The females lay between 300 and 500 eggs into a burrow dug out vertically by the male, which is 10 to 20 cm deep. Spawning locations are usually located out in the open away from any vegetation. The male then guards the eggs until they hatch, which is 9 to 11 days. Habitat loss and modification are the main threats to E. newberryi. The brackish areas where saltwater and freshwater meet are where they live usually, such as along the coast of California; this area has been altered by development. Barriers such as dikes and levees have been built to protect residents from potential flooding, but the creation of these barriers has reduced habitat for E. newberryi. Other reasons for population declines are attributed to exotic fish and amphibians which have been introduced to the region. Many of these fish prey on E. newberryi, and others outcompete them for food and habitat. The altering of streams flow with diversions has affected the salinity of the water and changed the habitat at creek mouths where E. newberryi has historically lived. Restoration projects have been started to bring populations back to a more stable number by making more habitat available, as well as providing protective areas. Some levees have been removed and exotic species reduction programs are being initiated.

S. Cardone. Plot NASA Captain Hickock arrives at Jackass Flats Proving Ground, a subterranean research facility. Mostly abandoned in 1962, it now houses ‚ÄúProject Shadowzone‚Äù. Hickock has been sent to investigate the death of a Shadowzone test subject and Tommy Shivers, the last of the maintenance staff, escorts him through the facility where they meet Dr. Erhardt, the second in command under Dr. Van Fleet. She introduces Dr. Kidwell, Wiley (the sole computer engineer) and finally Dr. Jonathan Van Fleet. The experiment consists of inducing extended deep sleep (EDS) in the two remaining patients while they‚Äôre in sleep chambers. Hickock insists the test be done again with all the same parameters, only longer this time, to prove it isn‚Äôt life threatening and Van Fleet reluctantly complies. The male subject‚Äôs veins begin to swell and eventually his head explodes. The computer system malfunctions and blows the site‚Äôs main power transformer causing an emergency shut down, sealing off the lab. Van Fleet, Kidwell and Hickock enter the test lab and move the female subject‚Äôs sleep chamber into the computer lab when Wiley notices a 5th life form present on the heat signature screen. Erhardt tells them to get out, that ‚ÄúJohn Doe‚Äù has arrived. Van Fleet seals himself in the lab and is attacked and killed. Erhardt explains their sleep experiment uncovered a gateway through the unconscious mind to a parallel dimension where they made contact with a life form (dubbed John Doe). She theorizes that John Doe has entered their dimension through the remaining male test subject. Wiley finds John Doe is no longer on the lab‚Äôs heat signature and theorizes the creature can expand/contract its molecular structure at will, (essentially a shapeshifter) and escaped through a drain pipe. The creature, also mildly radioactive, triggers the site‚Äôs emergency airlock installed as a failsafe for the nuclear research done in the 60‚Äôs, sealing them underground. Wiley and Hickock go to fix the transformer and Shivers and Kidwell go to get the site cook Mrs. Cutter, while Erhardt stays with the female subject (who cannot be woken until the main power‚Äôs restored) to monitor her. When Kidwell investigates one of the lab monkeys screeching, she finds the cage mangled and radios to Shivers to help her search. Meanwhile, Cutter hears one of her rat traps go off. When she reaches into the wall, a massive deformed rat bursts through and tears her arm off. Kidwell finds the monkey and radios to the others but Shivers replies that he already has the monkey with him. Kidwell‚Äôs screams are heard over the intercom as the monkey she found mutates and attacks her. Shivers finds Mrs. Cutter‚Äôs body and panics, shooting his shotgun wildly in all directions. Wiley and Hickock abandon repairing the transformer and try to find Shivers from the noise he‚Äôs making but only find chunks of flesh splattered on the walls and ceiling. Wiley manually powers up the elevator but it shorts out and only Hickock is able to get inside. Wiley‚Äôs blood splatters the elevator window as he‚Äôs pulled off screen. Hickock climbs through the top of the elevator and up to the lab‚Äôs level. In the computer lab, Erhardt is fascinated by the creature and theorizes that John Doe not only shape shifts but can take the form of human thought; Kidwell was searching for the monkey when encountering it and Dr. Van Fleet, before he ran off, called out a phobia that was recorded in his psych evaluation, indicating it took the form of his worst fear before killing him. The power suddenly returns as does the creature to the test lab. It takes control of the computer system and tells them it‚Äôs dying and needs to return to its own dimension, willing to spare them if they help it get home. Hickock hooks up the female subject to the test lab and they induce EDS, opening a portal to the other dimension. Erhardt insists on seeing it in person and sticks a metal rod into portal, watching as it‚Äôs pulled through. She steps in, briefly disappearing, before stepping back out saying excitedly ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs thousands of them!‚Äù. The metal rod is shoved out the portal and through her chest. The creature steps out, roars at Hickock and pulls Erhardt‚Äôs body through the portal with it. Hickock sets to destroying all the computers with a fire axe before an electric shock throws him back and he‚Äôs knocked unconscious. He wakes up to find the female subject awake and he lets her out of the sleep chamber as the credits roll.

After these three films, the company adopted the moniker \\"Full Moon Entertainment\\". The film saw an initial release sometime in January or February of 1990 distributed by Castle Hill as it was included in a list of new films expected to be released in 1990 in a \\"Coming Soon\\" article from the Los Angeles Times published January of that year. It saw a home media release on VHS by Paramount Home Entertainment on February 22, 1990. Full Moon released the film onto DVD in 2000, but it was discontinued for copyright reasons. It has since been re-released (by Full Moon Entertainment) on DVD several times and in the Full Moon Classics, Volume 1 box set, containing other Full Moon films like Arcade, Bad Channels, Seedpeople, and Netherworld. Reception Starburst Magazine gave the film a positive review and 7/10 stars in 2014, calling it a ‚Äúlittle-known offering‚Äù but a ‚Äúpleasant surprise‚Äù nonetheless. Reviewer Julian White specifically praised the film‚Äôs production design as ‚Äúattractively rusty and rickety‚Äù, the characters as ‚Äúcomplex and flawed‚Äù, and the script for creating ‚Äúcredible conundrums for the characters to worry about‚Äù. He goes on to further commend the film‚Äôs casting, praising Hong‚Äôs over-the-top performance as Dr. Van Fleet‚Äîthe scientist who will stop at nothing to see his experiment through as well as Beecroft‚Äôs leading man, despite his lack of star power. The pinnacle of the film however, is Fletcher‚Äôs performance as ‚Äúthe morally compromised but well intentioned‚Äù Erhardt, who White calls ‚Äúso good it makes you weep with frustration that she wasn't better appreciated by Hollywood‚Äù. The review also covers the quality of the DVD itself. Critic Phil Wheat called the film his \\"favorite non-franchise Full Moon flick\\" in a review written for Nerdly in 2014. He specifically praises the creature/gore effects by Mark Shostrom (Evil Dead II & A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors) as well as the casting of Fletcher and Hong. HorrorNews.net gave the film 4/5 stars in their review published in 2012. The review argues the film has all the right elements for a good science fiction/horror genre entry, but the execution is lacking. It goes on to commend the special effects and concludes that the films is \\"overshadowed by films like The Thing which tackle the subject matter a bit more effectively\\". The film was also covered as part of \\"Full Moon Friday\\" at Cinema-Crazed.com, although it was not recommended. The review mostly argues that the film is boring and is confusing in tone.

He is also known for being the author of Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). A strict advocate for limited government, Bruce wrote and promoted TABOR, a spending limitation measure approved by Colorado voters in 1992; his name is so associated with the measure that attempts to bypass its restrictions are known as \\"de-Brucing.\\" After two unsuccessful campaigns for the Colorado State Senate in 1996 and 2000, Bruce was eventually elected to the El Paso County, Colorado county commission in 2004. While a county commissioner, Bruce was noted for frequently falling on the losing sides of 4-1 votes, and for disputes with county staff and fellow commissioners on numerous occasions. Bruce was appointed to a vacant seat in the Colorado House of Representatives in December 2007 and represented House District 15, which encompasses eastern Colorado Springs. After kicking a Rocky Mountain News photographer on the day he was sworn in, Bruce became the first legislator in Colorado history to be formally censured; he was later removed from a House committee overseeing veterans affairs after refusing to sponsor a ceremonial resolution honoring veterans. Although defeated for election to a full term in the August 2008 Republican Party primary, Bruce continued his activism to reduce government expenditures and taxes in Colorado and in Colorado Springs. He was later indicted for a decades-worth of criminal activity for \\"cheating\\" Colorado out of millions of dollars under the guise of charity and anti-tax activism. In 2011, Douglas Bruce was convicted of all counts in the indictment, including four counts of felony criminal activity including money laundering, attempted improper influence of a public official, and tax fraud. He was discovered to be using a small-government charity he founded to hide millions of dollars from the state department of revenue. He was sentenced on February 13, 2012 to a total of 180 days in jail, ordered to pay a total of $49,000 in fines, and subject to six months of probation which included extensive disclosure requirements. Early career Born in Los Angeles, California, Bruce graduated from Hollywood High School, at the age of 16 and then from Pomona College with a double major in history and government. He completed a law degree from the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law in 1973, and worked as a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney from 1973 to 1979, resigning amid frustration with the court system. In 1980, Bruce ran a largely self-financed campaign for the California State Assembly, running in the Democratic Primary for the 38th Assembly district, which, at that time, centered on Pacific Palisades and Malibu. Running with the campaign slogan \\"Specifics, Not Safe Generalities,\\" Bruce ran what a local newspaper described as \\"something of an anomalya law and order primary campaign by a Democrat.\\" Bruce lost by five percentage points in a high- turnout primary; his opponent, Steven Afriat, narrowly lost the general election to Republican Marian la Follette. =Move to Colorado and rental properties= During the late 1970s, Bruce acquired a number of rental properties in the Los Angeles area, which he managed full-time after leaving the district attorney's office. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bruce was embroiled in several protracted tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service. In 1986, Bruce acquired several properties in Colorado Springs and moved to Colorado permanently. Shortly before moving to Colorado, Bruce changed his political party affiliation from Democrat to Republican. In addition to his Colorado Springs properties, Bruce acquired rental properties in Denver and Pueblo, Colorado. He has been cited repeatedly by law and code enforcement officials regarding the upkeep of his properties, although most of the dozens of citations brought against him have been overturned. In connection with charge of operating an unsafe building, Bruce spent eight days in jail in 1995 on a contempt of court citation. In response to the numerous complaints filed against him, Bruce has questioned the constitutionality of city code provisions, and accused city officials of selective prosecution and carrying out a \\"vendetta\\" against him personally. In 2003, Bruce announced that he intended to sell his rental properties in order to devote more time to political activism, but was cited by Colorado Springs for keeping dilapidated properties as recently as 2007. In 2008, Bruce was cited by Colorado Springs for two properties they considered \\"dilapidated,\\" in part because of windows boarded up under orders from the city, but the charges were ultimately dropped when Bruce sold the buildings. Shortly before his August 2008 legislative primary, Colorado Springs declared a four-plex owned by Bruce as \\"dilapidated;\\" Bruce responded that he had put money into repairing the building and readying it for sale. In early 2010, Colorado Springs told Bruce that it would charge him $40,000 to restart water service at seven of his rental properties, a charge that Bruce said amounted to political retaliation, but that city staff justified by noting of the properties had been abandoned. =Taxpayer's Bill of Rights= Although similar tax-limitation measures had been rejected by voters over the previous decades, in 1988, Bruce authored and led the campaign that was eventually successful in enacting TABOR, a \\"Taxpayer Bill of Rights,\\" in Colorado. Among other provisions, TABOR mandated voter approval of any tax increases and constrained state government spending to grow at a rate no greater than the rates of population growth and inflation. Although TABOR did not pass in 1988, garnering only 42% of the vote in a statewide reference, Bruce revised the measure and it was placed on the ballot again in 1990, when it received 49% support. A third attempt in 1992 was successful, and TABOR was passed with 54% of the vote and became part of Colorado's constitution.\\"Conference by Douglas Bruce\\" at Francisco Marroquin University. Guatemala, May 2004 In 1997, TABOR's restrictions on state spending were triggered for the first time, resulting in refunds to taxpayers. During these campaigns, Bruce was the primary spokesperson for TABOR, often trading barbs with TABOR opponent and Colorado governor Roy Romer. In one frequently-cited incident, Romer likened the TABOR proposal to \\"economic terrorism;\\" in response, Bruce printed personal business cards reading \\"Douglas Bruce: Terrorist.\\" The passage of TABOR was Bruce's most prominent political accomplishment; years later, Bruce's personalized license plate read \\"MRTABOR.\\" Bruce also wrote and successfully passed a similar spending limitation measure in Colorado Springs in 1991. The statewide and local effects of TABOR on government finances led Colorado College political science professor Bob Loevy, in 2009, to call Bruce \\"the most influential Colorado politician of his time.\\" Since the passage of TABOR in 1992, hundreds of local jurisdictions in Colorado have sought voter approval to temporarily or permanently exceed the spending limitations of TABOR, measures which became known as \\"de-Brucing,\\" in reference to TABOR's author. By 2007, over half of Colorado's school district and counties had \\"de-Bruced,\\" as had many municipalities. TABOR's budget restrictions were frequently cited by officials in Bruce's native El Paso County as resulting in deficiencies in health, law enforcement, and administrative services, and on the state level, creating financial difficulties for higher education. In 2005, after several years of tight budgets brought about by recession, the spending limitations of TABOR, and other budgetary obligations, the Colorado General Assembly referred Referendum C, a statewide \\"de-Brucing\\" measure, to Colorado voters. Bruce was a vocal opponent of Referendum C, facing off against supporters including Gov. Bill Owens, who had supported the original passage of TABOR. Referendum C, which was ultimately passed by voters, authorized a five-year \\"time-out\\" from some of TABOR's spending restrictions. Although Bruce threatened a lawsuit against the state of Colorado if the referendum passed, the measure was ultimately enacted into law, raising state revenue by several billion dollars. In 2008, following his term in the state legislature, Bruce argued against a measure to reverse some of the spending restrictions of the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights. The initiative, known as the Savings Account for Education, would divert refunds given to taxpayers under TABOR to a special fund for K-12 education. Bruce opposed the measure in legislative hearings and then filed a legal challenge once House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, its primary proponent, sought to place the measure on the Colorado ballot as a citizen initiative. The measure was ultimately placed on the November 2008 statewide ballot as Amendment 59, and Bruce launched a website opposing it. =State Senate campaigns= Bruce's first attempt to seek elected office in Colorado came in 1996, when Bruce challenged incumbent Republican state senator Ray Powers in the Republican Party primary. Bruce lost to Powers, who went on to become the Colorado State Senate President. Because of the negativity of Bruce's campaign against Powers, Bruce was the only person banned from Powers' ranch, a frequent site for Colorado Springs Republican fundraisers. Bruce also ran unsuccessfully for the Colorado State Senate in 2000, losing a hotly contested Republican party primary to Ron May in the solidly Republican district. Running with the slogan \\"Ron May, but Bruce will,\\" Bruce faced institutional opposition from statewide Republican leaders, including Governor Bill Owens, who had once supported Bruce's TABOR initiatives. May ultimately won by only 112 votes. =El Paso County Commissioner= 2004 election Bruce sought election to the El Paso County, Colorado, county commission in 2004, winning the Republican Party nomination by defeating Colorado Springs councilwoman Maraget Radford in the party primary. In the general election, Bruce defeated Democrat Stanley Hildahl and two Republicans who ran as write- in candidates with the backing of some party leaders. Bruce won the general election with 58% of the vote. Bruce self-funded his campaign, refusing to accept outside donations. Policy positions While serving on the El Paso County Commission, Bruce was frequently the only opposition to measures supported by the other four county commissioners. He cast the only vote against implementing mail ballot elections, against county interference in the proposed incorporation of Falcon, Colorado (although he also opposed the incorporation), against a package of road improvement projects recommended by the Colorado Department of Transportation, against the appointment of County Administrator Jeff Greene, against stricter building codes for mobile homes, and against awarding a county grant to an anti-poverty agency, calling it handouts for \\"deadbeats.\\" He was unsuccessful in attempting to reduce the number of paid holidays taken by county employees, but was instrumental in lowering property tax rates and in negotiating the expansion of a gravel pit operation. He also spoke in favor of turning over management of the county fair to a volunteer organization and called for the number of volunteer boards and commissions to be reduced. Bruce was also outspoken in support of deportation for illegal immigrants, and went against his normal practice of refusing to support ceremonial resolutions to support a resolution in favor of the creation of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in El Paso County. Conflicts with county staff and commissioners When Bruce joined the commission, he sought to have his salary of over $60,000 per year directed to charity, per a campaign promise. Designating Active Citizens Together, an educational non-profit he helped found, as the recipient, Bruce sought to have the county not withhold income tax from his checks, as the money would go directly to charity and he would receive no direct personal benefit. After ten months of disputing arrangements with county staff, Bruce agreed to accept checks with taxes and deductions withheld. In 2007, Bruce attempted to use the non-profit group to donate copies of the U.S. Constitution for local school districts to distribute to graduating seniors; several districts refused his donation on logistical grounds or policies forbidding distribution of external material. The nonprofit group has purchased tens of thousands of copies of the constitution, with the goal of giving one to every graduating high school senior in Colorado. Because of his opposition the methods used to finance its construction, Douglas Bruce, as a county commissioner in 2005, objected to the placement of his name on a plaque marking county support of the El Paso County Terry R. Harris Judicial Complex. (pictured) He also refused to accept a VIP pass from the Colorado Springs Airport, characterizing it as a \\"bribe;\\" he also objected to the introduction of public prayer during county commission meetings. Bruce also objected to the inclusion of his name (alongside other county commissioners) on a plaque marking county support of a new courthouse expansion, threatening to physically remove his name from the plaque; his opposition to financing methods for the courthouse had been a driving factor behind his 2004 county commission campaign. Bruce's debating and speaking style during county commission meetings led to occasional conflicts with county staff and other commissioners. During his first year, an escalating series of disputes with Commissioner Sallie Clark led to her ruling, at a meeting which she chaired, that Bruce was not allowed to discuss Colorado Springs city politics. In 2006, Bruce was also accused of intervening in a county bidding process for a copying contract in favor of a campaign supporter. In 2006, El Paso County Attorney Bill Louis denounced Bruce as a \\"narcissist, sociopath and crackpot enabler\\" for supporting Colorado's Amendment 38, a referendum designed to ease rules for petitioning measures onto election ballots. Bruce and Louis verbally tangled after Louis called Bruce's tactics \\"guerrilla\\" and Louis announced: \\"I plan to do everything in my limited power to make sure that [Bruce's tenure in elected office] comes to an end at some point for the good not only of this community but for all of Colorado and the nation.\\" Tensions also rose during Bruce's final weeks on the county commission, as he sought a vacancy committee's appointment to the state legislature. Bruce criticized county staff for being unresponsive to his inquiries, and Sheriff Terry Maketa responded by accusing Bruce of harming the morale of county staff, and told Bruce that he supported his bid for the legislature in order \\"to put you in an environment that will match your ineffectiveness,\\" a statement applauded by other county staff. During his final commission meetings, Bruce was also repeatedly cut off by other commissioners during his comments; other members of the commission described his behavior as an increase in \\"grandstanding\\" prior to the vacancy committee's meeting. =Activism in Colorado Springs= In June 2000, Bruce was called to appear as a potential juror for a sexual assault trial in Colorado Springs. During the jury selection process, Bruce distributed leaflets written by the Fully Informed Jury Association in support of jury nullification. After defense attorneys objected to Bruce's actions, the presiding judge dismissed Bruce and 50 other potential jurors who had received the fliers, resulting in a two-week delay for the trial. Bruce authored two measures, Issues 200 and 201, which appeared on the November 2006 Colorado Springs election ballot, and would have reduced the city's sales tax rate, eliminated its property tax, and restricted the city's ability to borrow money. The legality of the measures was challenged by city officials; the dispute rose to the Colorado Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the measures' placement on the ballot. Bruce also unsuccessfully contested both the editing of statements of support for the measures in ballot summaries mailed to voters, and what he claimed was deceptive wording in other taxation measures that election. Bruce was also the subject of several criminal citations  first in May 2006, stemming from charges that he campaigned against a tax increase for the Falcon Fire Protection District at a polling place closer than the legal limit, and then in August 2009, when he and another man were charged with trespassing after being asked by police to stop soliciting signatures outside a Costco for the second time in a year. Bruce alleged that the City of Colorado Springs attempted to \\"bully\\" him and violate his First Amendment rights, a charge city officials denied. A trial was eventually held after paperwork errors, a tainted jury pool, and claims by Bruce of selective prosecution; after a three-day trial, both were acquitted. Bruce later filed an unsuccessful complaint alleging professional misconduct by the case's prosecutor and judge. Colorado House of Representatives =Appointment, swearing-in, and censure= On the morning before being sworn in, Bruce kicked a Rocky Mountain News photographer while on the floor of the Colorado House of Representatives (pictured). For this action, Bruce became the first legislator in Colorado history to be officially censured. In October 2007, Bruce was chosen over two other Republican contenders for the state house seat vacated by Rep. Bill Cadman, following a short but contentious battle for the appointment. Bruce received two-thirds of the votes from the 66-member vacancy committee. Although eligible to be sworn in immediately after his appointment was certified, Bruce postponed the oath of office in order to be eligible to serve a full four terms beyond the partial term under Colorado's term limits rules, an action which was criticized by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. His delay led to the enactment of legislation requiring legislators to be sworn in within 14 days of their selection. Bruce cast the only dissenting vote on the measure. Bruce also demanded to be sworn in in front of the full house, a request denied by both Republican and Democratic leadership. He acquiesced to an individual swearing- in ceremony on January 14 after House Republicans voted 22-1 to call for a representative to be named for District 15 if Bruce did not take the oath of office by the end of the day. On the morning before he was sworn in, Bruce kicked a Rocky Mountain News photographer who took Bruce's picture during the prayer; Bruce accused the photographer of \\"violating the order and decorum\\" of the house, and refused to apologize, describing his action instead as a \\"nudge or a tap.\\" A six-member legislative panel recommended 6-0 that Bruce be censured by the House for his actions. On January 24, the full House of Representatives voted 62-1 to censure Bruce. He became the first representative in the recorded history of the state house to be formally censured. =Legislative agenda= For the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Bruce was named to seats on the House Finance Committee and the House State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee. Before the session began, Bruce denounced much of the House Republican caucus' legislative agenda as \\"streamlining socialism.\\" Bruce was similarly critical of the proposed state budget debated during the 2008 legislative session; however, his budget amendment proposals were unsuccessful. All of the legislation introduced by Bruce died in House committees, including proposals to distribute copies and require instruction on the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution to high school seniors,l to prohibit counties from assessing any charges other than property taxes on property tax bills, to raise legislative pay and index pay to inflation, and to create a bipartisan panel to draw up Colorado's congressional and legislative districts. Bruce routinely objected to the practice of attaching a \\"safety clause\\" to bills, the inclusion of which declares the bill as \\"necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety,\\" enacting it into law sooner and prohibiting challenges to the legislation via the petition process. He offered amendments to a number of bills to remove the safety clause, which often failed on account of legislators' personal hostility towards him; however, in 2008, 41% of bills passed had no safety clause, up from 25% the previous year. Bruce also opposed proposals to raise signature requirements for citizen-initiated constitutional amendments, and opposed a bill to impose new requirements on landlords, despite criticism that voting on the measure constituted a conflict of interest. =Removal from committee= Consistent with Bruce's practice as a county commissioner, Bruce opposed ceremonial resolutions in the legislature, and on February 13, was the lone legislator who refused to sign on as a cosponsor to a resolution recognizing Military and Veterans Appreciation Day. Other Republican legislators denounced Bruce in a public letter for \\"callous indifference\\" towards veterans, and Republican Minority Leader Mike May removed Bruce from the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee. Bruce offered as evidence of his support for veterans his successful amendment to a house bill to include interest in a state repayment to the Colorado Veterans Trust Fund, a move which resulted in an additional $636,000 repaid to the fund. Bruce would later cite this as one of his major accomplishments during the 2008 session. =\\"Illiterate peasants\\" comments= On April 21, 2008, Bruce voiced opposition during house debate on a bill sponsored by Rep. Marsha Looper (R) to create a guest worker program to facilitate temporary employment visas for agricultural workers from Mexico. After speaking against illegal immigration and being advised to restrict comments to the bill by debate chair Rep. Kathleen Curry, Bruce took the floor a second time and commented: Bruce was immediately gavelled to order by Rep. Kathleen Curry, who ruled that he would no longer be recognized during debate on the bill. Bruce's comments were denounced by legislators on both sides of the aisle, as well the Mexican consulate in Denver. Bruce proudly defended his remarks as being factually accurate, citing dictionary definitions of \\"illiterate\\" and \\"peasant.\\" Legislators responded to Bruce's propensity for generating controversy by declaring that they would \\"start ignoring him.\\" The following weekend, Bruce's comments were the target of a local protest in Colorado Springs. =2008 election= Air Force veteran Mark Waller (pictured) defeated Bruce for the 2008 Republican Party nomination for the state house. Bruce announced in November 2007 that he would stand in the 2008 general election for the House District 15 seat. He faced a challenge for the Republican nomination from attorney and Iraq War veteran Mark Waller. Bruce funded his own campaign with over $30,000 of personal funds, refusing to accept private campaign donations; Waller, however, received endorsements or contributions from at least five sitting state representatives, and Colorado Attorney General John Suthers. Waller received 57% of the vote at the Republican assembly in March, claiming the top line on the August Republican primary ballot; he did not differ publicly with Bruce on political positions, but argued that Bruce's temperament caused him to be an ineffective legislator. Both Bruce and Waller accused each other of inappropriate conduct while campaigning; Bruce was accused of inappropriately distributing campaign flyers to Republican representatives on the House floor, of mailing flyers promoting his charity shortly before the primary, and of inappropriately listing endorsements on his web site. In turn, Bruce filed several campaign finance complaints against Waller, one of which resulted in Waller's campaign being fined for failing to properly disclose a campaign contribution. Ultimately, Bruce was defeated for the Republican nomination in the August 12 party primary, taking 48 percent of the vote to Waller's 52 percent. Post- legislative activism =Colorado Springs= In 2007, Bruce began a series of challenges to the City of Colorado Springs' creation of a Stormwater Enterprise Fee, which he contended amounted to an illegal tax collected by a government entity. After his first attempt at a ballot measure to end the fee was held to violate Colorado's single subject rule, Bruce gained permission for a second petition following a year-long battle over wording, and placed the measure on the November 2008 ballot following struggles to collect the necessary number of signatures but were rejected by voters. Bruce was again successful at placing a measure targeting the Stormwater Enterprise on the ballot in 2009, despite challenges from the city that signatures were not submitted in time, but not after Bruce lost disputes over the wording of the ballot measures. Bruce's Issue 300 was passed by voters with about 55 percent of the vote, and mandated that enterprise payments to Colorado Springs be phased out over eight years. Bruce and city officials disputed, even before the election, as to whether his measure would apply to the city's Stormwater Enterprise Fee; and after threatening to launch a ballot initiative to cut property taxes after an initial 5-4 vote by the city council over two years, the city council then voted 5-4 to phase out the authority immediately. Bruce, however, objected to the city council's proposed implementation of the initiative, which would allow the city to collect payments from the authority in exchange for services rendered. Bruce claimed that this would \\"undo the plain meaning of issue 300,\\" and made similar claims regarding a local government restructuring proposal made by Colorado Springs mayor Lionel Rivera. In March 2010, Bruce filed suit against the city of Colorado Springs and its city council, charging that they had illegally hired outside legal counsel. He also accused the council members of receiving benefits greater than that authorized by law. In June 2010, Bruce filed a ballot measure to dramatically expand the powers of the city's mayor, including eliminating the positions of city manager, chief financial officer, and communications staff, as well as giving the mayor power to veto ordinances, lower taxes, and excuse city code violations. =Statewide ballot measures= Although Bruce attempted to distance himself from three statewide ballot measures aimed at limiting Colorado governments' power to raise and borrow money, several petitioners for the measures were linked to Bruce through records showing that they temporarily resided at one of his Colorado Springs apartment buildings, and through their past work on TABOR initiatives in other states and petitioning for Bruce's Issue 300 in Colorado Springs. The three measures  Amendment 60, Amendment 61 and Proposition 101  would impose restrictions or tax cuts, eliminate governments' ability to borrow money without voter approval, cut the state income tax from 4.63 to 3.5 percent, and eliminate vehicle ownership taxes. Opponents of the ballot measures filed a complaint alleging the backers violated Colorado campaign finance laws by failing to disclose contributions and expenditures. Bruce was subpoenaed to testify in a hearing related to the case in March, but contested the summons unsuccessfully. During the month of May 2010, the state attempted 29 times to serve a notice of a court order testify to Bruce at his Colorado Springs residence; Bruce stated that he was out of town at the time, although both notices and delivered newspapers were removed during that period. At a hearing in late May, one of the ballot measures' sponsors, Michelle Northrup, testified that she had met with Bruce before the measures were filed and that he provided advice on submitting the initiates and other legal matters. In early June, an administrative law judge ruled that the evidence showed Bruce was behind the three measures and imposed fines on their proponents, and state attorney general John Suthers' office stated that they would seek a contempt citation against Bruce in district court. Crime, trial, conviction and sentence In 2010, Bruce was charged with money laundering, attempted bribery of a public official and tax fraud, after he was discovered to be using a small-government charity he founded to hide millions of dollars from the Colorado department of revenue, pocketing interest and using the funds to further his political agenda. The case went to trial during which Bruce acted as his own attorney and, after eight days of trial, on December 22, 2011, after only four hours of deliberation, jurors convicted Bruce on four counts. On February 13, 2012, he was sentenced to two consecutive 90-day jail terms and six months of probation, during which he would have to make extensive financial disclosures to the court aimed to ensure he did not become a repeat offender. That was less than the two years of prison the District Attorney had asked for. Bruce was also ordered to pay around $21,000 to cover the cost of prosecution, and about $29,000 to cover the taxes that were owed. State Assistant Attorney General Robert Shapiro said, \\"Mr. Bruce, for personal, selfish and narcissistic reasons, took advantage of our charitable-giving process. He was able to cheat Colorado for the better part of a decade.\\" Bruce defiantly denounced the trial, saying without contrition, \\"This was the dirtiest trial I have seen in 38 years, regardless of the outcome.\\" On February 13, 2012, Denver District Judge Anne Mansfield sentenced Bruce to six months in jail and six years on probation, imposing strict conditions that required him to disclose in detail his financial life, even allowing the government access to his personal computers.The Durango Herald 02/14/2012  Doug Bruce gets jail time in tax case Mansfield said she doubted Bruce would successfully complete his probation because he had showed up late to his trial and introduced evidence by throwing documents onto the floor. \\"The defendant has absolutely no regard for the rule of law. His behavior during trial was reprehensible,\\" Manfield said. Assistant Attorney General Robert Shapiro said the outcome was fair: \\"Mr. Bruce‚Äôs life is going to be extremely transparent. That‚Äôs all we ever wanted,\\" he said. Bruce remained defiant, saying, \\"They will be able to have my body, but they cannot have my soul\\". Bruce began serving his sentence February 17, 2012. He spent 104 days in jail, and was paroled under 20 terms and conditions. After a year, the probation department of the Denver District Court brought two complaints against Bruce. It claimed that he failed to submit financial disclosures and tax filings, didn't disclose a financial deal with Colorado Springs Councilwoman Helen Collins, and didn't report code violations and court cases related to six properties he owns in Ohio, Wisconsin and Illinois, nor nearly $22,000 in delinquent taxes on three Ohio properties. On March 11, 2016, Bruce was found in violation of his probation and sentenced to two years. He served his sentence in several locations, including the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility in Ca√±on City, Colorado and Delta, Colorado. On July 28, 2016, Bruce appeared before the Colorado State Board of Parole, where he was granted parole on his eligibility date of September 3, 2016. Bruce was quoted as saying \\"I accept responsibility for all my actions. I deeply regret them. It will never happen again.\\" References External links * Douglas Bruce - personal web site * El Paso County Commission web site Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Colorado House of Representatives Category:County commissioners in Colorado Category:Colorado Republicans Category:Pomona College alumni Category:USC Gould School of Law alumni Category:Politicians from Colorado Springs, Colorado Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:American anti‚Äìillegal immigration activists Category:American politicians convicted of fraud Category:American people convicted of tax crimes Category:People convicted of money laundering Category:Prisoners and detainees of Colorado Category:Colorado politicians convicted of crimes ","title":"Douglas Bruce"},{"id":"13882338","text":"A training school is an official designation, awarded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, to schools in England that provide exceptional facilities for in-service and work experience training of teachers.

Located near a freshwater spring above the floodplain of Dancing Rabbit Creek in the southwestern part of the county, it was the site of a treaty negotiation between the Choctaw and the federal government in 1830, resulting in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, in which the Choctaw agreed to surrender their ancestral lands for territory in what is now Oklahoma. It was the first treaty negotiated after passage of the Indian Removal Act, and served as a model for other treaties passed pursuant to that act. It also led to the Choctaw Trail of Tears. The site, now marked by a stone memorial and a small Choctaw cemetery, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996. and Description and history The Dancing Rabbit Creek Treaty Site is located in a remote wooded area of southwestern Noxubee County, on the southeast side of Dancing Rabbit Creek. It is accessed via Monument Road, where the commemorative marker and cemetery mark the center of the landmarked area. There are no historical structures standing in the area, although there was at the time of the treaty negotiation a Choctaw meeting house which was the central point of the meeting that culminated in the treaty signing. The granite marker was placed in 1928 by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. It soon became the focus of Choctaw commemorative activities, including the burial of some of their dead. The marker's placement was based on research conducted in the late 19th century by Henry S. Halbert, a Choctaw historian, that included oral histories from witnesses and individuals who had known witnesses to the proceedings. The Choctaw were one of the \\"Five Civilized Tribes\\" of the southeastern United States, which had to some extent adopted Euro-American customs, and developed an independent tribal government system including a constitution. Despite this, pressure from white settlers for their lands (historically including parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana) had prompted the tribe to ceded some of its lands in the 1820s. President Andrew Jackson, upon taking office in 1828, sought the removal of the Choctaw and other southeastern tribes to lands in what was then termed the Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. The treaty negotiations with the Choctaw took place between September 15 and 27, 1830. The proceedings were attended by several thousand Choctaw, a number of opportunistic white entrepreneurs, who offered gambling, drink, and other vices to the assemblage, and John H. Eaton and John Coffee, the federal government representatives. Many Choctaw expressed disapproval of the treaty offered for consideration on September 22, and a large number left the encampment over the next few days. Three major chiefs signed the treaty, under a questionable set of conditions that may have included threats, bribery, and extortion. The vast majority of Choctaw were removed to Oklahoma in 1831-33.

It is located on a peninsula along the Houston Ship Channel and surrounded on three sides by Burnet Bay, Crystal Bay, and Scott Bay. The Baytown Nature Center is both a recreation area and a wildlife sanctuary that is home to hundreds of bird species, mammals, reptiles, and aquatic species. The City of Baytown created this Nature Center in 1994. The SWA Group's Houston office provided land planning and landscape architectural services.  History  View of the wetland trails The Baytown Nature Center was, for many years, a highly desirable residential neighborhood known as Brownwood with nearly 400 substantial homes on a peninsula.Baker (2005), pg. 20. In 1961, Hurricane Carla devastated the Texas Gulf Coast, flooding most of Brownwood and ending any new development in the area. Afterwards, subsidence became a serious problem as industrial and municipal water users along the Houston Ship Channel and in the general Houston area pumped out groundwater faster than natural forces could replenish the aquifer(s). Thus, during the 1970s and 1980s, much of the Texas Gulf Coast (including most of Brownwood) sank a total of 10 to . Brownwood, which had previously been high and dry, was repeatedly inundated by high tides and storms. In 1983, extensive damage from Hurricane Alicia finally led to the abandonment of most of Brownwood's homes.Baker (2005), pg. 21. The City of Baytown started buying out the properties of neighborhood residents. In 1984, the City prepared its first master plan to transform these properties into a public park and wildlife sanctuary. By 1990, the steadily encroaching waters had submerged many Brownwood streets. In 1991, Baytown's voters approved $300,000 in bonds for the Brownwood Marsh Restoration Project. Although the bonds were sold in 1994, the $300,000 was hardly enough to meet the master plan's $1.4 million budget. The short-fall was made up by the French Limited Task Group, a Superfund consortium of 200 companies, headed by ARCO Chemical Company. A United States District Court had ordered the Task Group to carry out a marsh restoration project to replace natural resources that were damaged or destroyed by members‚Äô illegal dumping activities. The City of Baytown carried out the phased restoration project. Crouch Environmental Services, a Houston-based environmental consulting firm which specializes in wetlands design and construction, was the prime consultant and contractor. The Houston office of The SWA Group‚Äîan international land planning, landscape architecture, and urban design firm based in Sausalito, California‚Äîprovided land planning and landscape architectural services.  Planning and development  In 1994, the Brownwood Marsh Restoration Project's master plan, which had been prepared by Crouch Environmental Services and The SWA Group, was approved by a Project Review Group consisting of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Texas General Land Office. In late 1994, work on the Brownwood Marsh Restoration Project began. First, work crews sealed the inlets into nearby Scott Bay so that they could temporarily pump the water out of the property. Then, workers removed the remaining roads, houses, and utilities from the site. Afterwards, they graded the property and dug three -wide channels through the property. Once work was complete, these channels were used to re-flood the site and provide good crosscurrent flows to encourage natural restoration activity and feed the returning wetlands wildlife. The channels also provided the necessary tidal exchange (with its nutrient-rich, oxygenated waters) to help create important ‚Äúedge‚Äù habitats for crustaceans, fish, and birds. In their grading operations, the crews also transformed two elevated areas, which included hundreds of mature trees, into islands and created four new small freshwater ponds. These freshwater ponds and the planting of cabbage palmettos, live oaks, as well as beneficial bottomland shrubs and trees like red maple and green ash, were designed to lure a wide variety of migrant and indigenous birds, reptiles, and small mammals to the site. For the Baytown Nature Center's watery edges and its inland areas, Crouch Environmental Services and The SWA Group selected flora with high value for wildlife, like nesting areas and food. They also specified plant species like Smooth cordgrass, Sedge, Wiregrass, and live oaks that already thrived in this coastal area. As early as Fall 1995, with just one phase of construction largely completed, deer, fish, crustaceans, and 275 bird species had already appeared in the new wetlands, including two endangered species: the Osprey, a fish-eating hawk, and the three-foot-tall wood stork.  The Baytown Nature Center today  Today, the Baytown Nature Center has two peninsulas. Absolutely all dogs/pets are banned - even those remaining within their owners vehicle. The smaller of the two peninsulas‚ÄîSan Jacinto Point‚Äîis designated as a recreation area. In addition to large oak trees and grass lawns, San Jacinto Point has three fishing piers, an observation platform, a Children's Nature Discovery Area playground, picnic tables, benches, and a concrete walkway along the bay shoreline. The much larger peninsula‚Äîknown as the Natural Area‚Äîhas two islands with mixed woodlands, a saltwater marsh, freshwater marsh, several ponds, as well as mixed woodlands and tall grass habitats for birds, mammals, and other wildlife. The Crystal Bay Butterfly Garden near the entrance is planted with native plants and wildflowers that attract butterflies and hummingbirds. The Brownwood Education Pavilion‚Äîa covered shelter atop a -high hill surrounded by wetlands‚Äîhas panoramic views of the Natural Area's wetlands and the three surrounding bays. Five nature trails of varying lengths loop through the peninsula. The Natural Area's observation blinds and platforms overlook the ponds. They, along with wood duck boxes and trails, are far enough away from the islands and nesting areas to avoid disturbing the burgeoning wildlife, yet close enough for Baytown residents and visitors to observe nature's beauty and diversity. Currently home to 317 species of resident and neo-tropical migratory birds, the Baytown Nature Center is part of the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail, a trail of bird watching sites from Beaumont to Brownsville. Operated by the City of Baytown and open to the public (for a fee), the Baytown Nature Center has also become an important nursery area for a variety of aquatic species, including shrimp, crab, and various fish.

Expandable batons in general are sometimes referred to as \\"Asps\\". The batons come in three sizes: , and , and the company has adopted a European measurement standard. They are available with several variations, such as color (black being the most common, but some have nickel-plated shafts), grip pattern and material, and metal composition, the most common being 4140 high carbon steel, with an \\"airweight\\" line using a light-weight alloy with a combination of steel and aluminum. ASP batons are friction-lock in design, and are opened by swinging the handle forcibly through the air. To close this type, the baton's tip is driven into a hard surface to break the friction. A version introduced in 2010 but since discontinued is called \\"LeverLoc\\", opened the same way was as friction-lock, but closable by twisting the shafts with both hands, and slightly longer when collapsed state due to the mechanism; a LeverLoc designed for plain-clothes concealment was also produced.

The machine had a rudimentary intelligence and the ability to survive on its own. As it wandered through the white halls of the laboratory, it would seek black wall outlets. When it found one it would plug in and recharge. The robot was cybernetic. It did not use a computer. Its control circuitry consisted of dozens of transistors controlling analog voltages. It used photocell optics and sonar to navigate. The 2N404 transistors were used to create NOR logic gates that implemented the Boolean logic to tell it what to do when a specific sensor was activated. The 2N404 transistors were also used to create timing gates to tell it how long to do something. 2N1040 Power transistors were used to control the power to the motion treads, the boom, and the charging mechanism. The original sensors in Mod I were physical touch only. The wall socket was detected by physical switches on the arm that followed the wall. Once detected, two electrical prongs were extended until they entered the wall socket and made the electrical connection to charge the vehicle. The stairway, doors, and pipes on the hall wall were also detected by physical switches and recognized by appropriate logic. The sonar guidance system was developed for Mod I and improved for Mod II. It used two ultrasonic transducers to determine distance, location within the halls, and obstructions in its path. This provided \\"The Beast\\" with bat-like guidance. At this point, it could detect obstructions in the hallway, such as people in the hallway. Once an obstruction was detected, the Beast would slow down and then decide whether to stop or divert around the obstruction. It could also ultrasonically recognize the stairway and doorways to take appropriate action. An optical guidance system was added to Mod II. This provided, among other capabilities, the ability to optically identify the black wall sockets that contrasted with the white wall.

It was built by her parents in 1925. In it she did all her writing, in an upstairs bedroom. Welty and her mother built and tended the garden over decades. The house was first declared a Mississippi Landmark in 2001, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, and declared a National Historic Landmark in 2004. This was part of a raised awareness of the significance of authors and literary life in the United States. The house was restored by the Eudora Welty Foundation and the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. In 2006 the house and garden were opened to the public as an author's house museum. The renovation of the house and garden is part of a larger effort to celebrate and promote Mississippi's literary heritage as a means of developing tourism to the state. In 2009, the Education and Visitors Center was opened next door at 1109 Pinehurst Street. There, visitors can purchase tickets to tour the Welty House, see a selection of Welty's literary awards, and explore exhibits based on the author's memoir, One Writer's Beginnings.

The Cen√©l Conaill, a branch of the northern U√≠ N√©ill, had been excluded from the alternating succession to the High Kingship which had been largely dominated by the northern Cen√©l nE√≥gain kings of Ailech and the southern Clann Cholm√°in kings of Mide since the early the 8th century. Ruaidr√≠ was a descendant in the seventh generation of the previous Cen√©l Conaill High King, Flaithbertach mac Loingsig. In the period before Ruaidr√≠ ua Canann√°in rose to prominence, the Cen√©l nE√≥gain heir apparent to the High Kingship, Muirchertach mac N√©ill, was killed in battle in 943, while the High King, Donnchad Donn of Clann Cholm√°in, died the following year. The deaths of Muirchertach and Donnchad appear to have left the field open to less likely competitors. The U√≠ N√©ill king lists make Congalach Cnogba of the southern S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine, a kin group long excluded from the succession, Donnchad's successor. Congalach was Donnchad's sister's son. However, Donnchad's apparent policy of making strategic marriages to rising families also made Ruaidr√≠ his kinsman. His aunt, Cainnech ingen Canann√°in (d. 929), had been Donnchad's first wife. Ruaidr√≠, whose home base was in the south of modern Donegal, first comes to notice after the death of Muirchertach. In 943 he defeated the Cen√©l nE√≥gain and the northmen of Lough Foyle, killing M√°el Ruanaid mac Flainn, Muirchertach's cousin. With the loss of M√°el Ruanaid after Muirchertach, the Cen√©l nE√≥gain were eclipsed, leaving Ruaidr√≠ as master of the north at Donnchad's death. Most sources make Congalach Cnogba High King in succession to Donnchad. Sources claiming that Ruaidr√≠ assumed the High Kingship after Donnchad, either alone or jointly with Congalach, are: the Prophecy of Berch√°n, an 11th-century historical poem presented as a prophecy; the southern, anti-U√≠ N√©ill Annals of Innisfallen; and the 12th-century Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib (The War of the Irish with the Foreigners) a wildly successful work of propaganda authored on behalf of the descendants of Brian B√≥ruma. The form of the Prophecy of Berch√°n makes identifying the subjects, who are referred to by often obscure epithets rather than names, sometimes difficult. In the case of Ruaidr√≠ ua Canann√°in, the identification is obvious: > After that a king from the North takes sovereignty...; Red [ruad] will be > the name of that king (r√≠), he puts Ireland into anxiety. The record shows both men active in the midlands of Ireland. Men of Ruaidr√≠'s were killed by Congalach and Amla√≠b Cuar√°n, king of Dublin, in 945. In 947 Ruaidr√≠ led an army to Slane in County Meath in 947, defeating Congalach and Amla√≠b. The Cen√©l nE√≥gain were again the target in 949 when Muirchertach's son Flaithbertach was killed. In 950 Ruaidr√≠ ua Canann√°in led an army into the midlands and campaigned there for six months. He defeated Congalach and his ally Gofraid mac Sitriuc, King of Dublin, and set up camp, probably somewhere between Donaghpatrick and Kells, from which he raided Brega and Meath. According to the Annals of Ulster, his army defeated an attack by the foreigners of Dublin on his camp on 30 November 950, but Ruaidr√≠ himself was killed in the fight along with his son Niall. At his death he is called \\"heir designate of Ireland\\" by the Annals of Ulster, the same title as was used of Muirchertach at his death in 943. The Prophecy of Berch√°n, apparently following a different tradition, has Ruaidr√≠ killed by a Leinsterman. Ruaidr√≠'s reign was the high point of Ua Canann√°in power. In the years following his death various of his kinsmen were killed by Congalach and Cen√©l n√âogain, and these deaths, together with the rising power of their Ua M√°el Doraid kinsmen largely excluded the Ua Canann√°in even from the kingship of Cen√©l Conaill.

Main characters =Casper= Casper is new to the school, serves as a main character. He is a ghost who is friendly and kind. He lives with his three uncles, Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso. In Scare School, Casper's closest best friends are Mantha, an independent Zombie girl, Ra, a not too smart Mummy whom he loves like a family and he continuously faces the dangers of Thatch, a vampire bully and the Headmasters, Alder & Dash. Casper is voiced by Devon Werkheiser in the film, Robbie Sublett in the first season and Matthew G√©czy in the second season. =Ra= A mummy far away from his tomb but he fits in at Scare School. He is more than 2000 years old (in the episode 2,500 Candles for Ra he celebrates his 2500th birthday) and is royalty. His full name is Ra Neferhefu Saraoftonni Sereftefnefgeranebu which is revealed in 2,500 Candles for Ra. Ra also once disobeyed his parents and forged his Dad's signature on a permission slip to go with his friends on a camping trip. He was caught but his parents allowed him to stay in Scare School. Another time, Ra, with Casper's help, showed off in front of students, making him popular, which went to his head. Thatch dared him to make a jump over the Void of lost Souls, but he didn't go through it and admitted to being a fake. In the episode Curse of the Sandwich it is revealed that Ra can also be quite gullible. Throughout the episode Ra was convinced that he was turning into a vampire after accidentally taking a bite out of Thatch's sandwich despite Casper and Mantha telling him he wasn't. When Thatch overheard Mantha and Casper talking he convinces Ra that he was becoming his mindless minion. Casper was able to convince Ra that he wasn't becoming a vampire when he pointed out Ra still had his reflection in a mirror. Of course Thatch took out the mirror in the middle of the night and by morning Ra was now convinced he was Thatch's mindless minion when he couldn't see his reflection. He was only able to finally be convinced he wasn't a vampire after seeing his reflection in a pool of water inside the caverns. His best friends are Casper, Mantha and Jimmy. Ra is allergic to poison and flowers. He is also a good singer and dancer. Ra is voiced by Kendr√© Berry in the film, Carter Jackson in the first season and Sharon Mann in the second season and sounds similar to Aelita Schaeffer from Code Lyoko. =Mantha= A zombie. Mantha is able to remove parts of her body at will. Despite lacking any physical connection between her head and those parts of her body removed in this fashion, Mantha remains able to control said parts at all times (e.g., she is able to see using eyes removed from their sockets and detached from their optic nerves). She is sometimes unable to keep them attached to her body, Mantha once required a replacement for her arms. She successfully proves that zombies can be scary too by defeating Thatch in a scaring contest, a feat accomplished by her luring of unsuspecting humans into Casper and his Uncles' haunted house. Mantha is very proud to be a zombie and sets out to prove that zombies are more than just \\"lumbering, mindless things that fall apart\\". In the episode You Oughta Be In Pictures she helped a group of zombies (not realizing they were actors filming for a movie) fight off some humans (also actors) that were attacking because she wanted zombies to defend for themselves and not let others push them around anymore. In the end of the episode she was the inspiration for 'Z, Queen of the Zombies' for a movie, which could help the reputations of other zombies. Her best friends are Casper, Ra and Jimmy. Mantha is voiced by Christy Carlson Romano in the film, Vanessa Bellardini in the first season and Mirabelle Kirkland in the second season. Her voice is similar to Yumi Ishiyama from Code Lyoko. =Thatch= Thatch is the school bully at Scare School who is a vampire, mainly an antagonist in the film. He says he is, and seems to be popular, but a jerk instead, as he is conniving, selfish and mean. He is always looking for things to exploit and use to his advantage. His gang usually includes Slither, Dummy Girl, Mosshead and occasionally Harpy. In the film, he deputized the Skeletwins (Mickey and Monaco) to help him watch over Casper. Thatch displays vampiric traits, mostly his ability to shapeshift into a bat and having no reflection. Unlike most stereotypical vampires, all of his teeth are sharp and he seems to have no aversion to sunlight as he has been in Deedstown several times during the day. He apparently has acid for tears as he once cried for not having the respect of his gang, his tears burning holes through his cape. Although he's a bully, once in a while he finds common grounds with Casper and his friends, and even occasionally helps them (he even wished Ra a happy birthday), but goes right back to being the way he was before, as if nothing happened. Thatch likes to collect toy ducks. Thatch has grey skin, black hair streaked with a single line of white, violet eyes, pale black lips. He wears a white shirt and a black cape with black jeans with a chain In the film, Thatch was voiced by Matthew Underwood and in the TV series, voiced by Carter Jackson in the first season and Matthew G√©czy in the second season. Geczy's portrayal gives Thatch a voice similar to his previous role Odd Della Robbia from Code Lyoko. =Kibosh= A green ghost who is the large-and-in-charge ruler of the underworld, usually seen terrorizing fleshies or at the scare school, he is feared by all, Alder & Dash especially. In the movie it is revealed that the reason he is so tough on Casper is because he used to be just like him when he was his age. Kibosh once posed as a monster that steals creatures' powers with the use of a magic crystal in order to get Scare School to work together, but things went out of control when his leprechaun servant Raznik stole the crystal and tried to take over. But he was thwarted and Kibosh apologized for the whole mess and congratulated the students on their teamwork even without their powers and used the crystal to restore them to their rightful owners. He is voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson in the film, Mike Power in the first season and Matthew G√©czy in the second season. =Fatso, Stinky and Stretch= Their bio will be revealed in Casper's bio. These incarnations of the Ghostly Trio is unique as they actually treat Casper as their nephew, and not a slave they're disappointed of; though they still love scaring humans and fear Kibosh. They make several appearances during the series, sometimes to make money or to help their nephew. Dan Castellaneta voiced Stretch, John DiMaggio voiced Stinky and Billy West voiced Fatso in the film. In the TV series, Fatso is voiced by Joe Sheridan while Stinky and Stretch are voiced by Matthew G√©czy. =Jimmy Bradley= Casper's human friend. Casper would occasionally leave the school to hang out with him. Jimmy is also friends with Ra and Mantha. He doesn't appear to have any human friends. His parents are at first unaware of their son's friendship with a ghost, but Jimmy's dad finds out in the special \\"Power Outage\\". Jimmy is one of the few humans who ever visited scare school. In the episode \\"A Real Little Monster\\", Casper took him to scare school, disguised as a creature named Jimbacca. Jimmy is voiced by Brett Delbuono in the film, Adam Carter in the first season and Mirabelle Kirkland in the second season. His voice in the second season was more like the movie, unlike the first season and sounds similar to Milly from Code Lyoko. =Alder and Dash= Scare school's 2 headed headmaster(s) who wants world domination. Alder, the shorter right head, liked the quarter behind the ear trick and Dash, the taller left head, liked music. Alder can be seen with a fez and Dash can be seen with a long straight forehead topped with an Academic Cap. Dash is the smarter, more conniving of the two, while Alder is slower on the uptake, but occasionally has good ideas. They are both rude and manipulative, and delight in causing the students misery. In the movie, they were fed up with being the headmasters of Scare School and concocted a plan, and a potion, to usurp Kibosh and take over the underworld. Their plans were stopped by the return of their \\"Ankle\\" (Aunt & Uncle), Belle and Murray. Their names are a pun on balderdash. Alder is voiced by James Belushi and Dash is voiced by Bob Saget in the film. Alder is voiced by Graham Thomas in the first season. Dash is voiced by Robert Williams in the first season. Matthew G√©czy voices both of them in the second season. =Wolfie= Wolfie is a shy but clever werewolf and one of Casper's closest friends, although the relationship seems on and off as he is not seen in Casper's company as often as Mantha or Ra, possibly because he's not an undead monster like Casper (Ghost), Mantha (Zombie), or Ra (Mummy). Wolfie is just like a puppy he likes to fetch, chase his tail and can't resist bones. He is usually picked on by Thatch and his gang, but every full moon, he goes berserk and has to eat in the corner of the cafeteria for the other students' safety; when this happens he grows 15 times his original size and he becomes very strong, very fast, and out of control and ferociously vicious. He once conducted an experiment in efforts to capture and harness moonlight when the moon was full, but it caused an energy surge that caused everyone in the school to act the opposite of how they normally would. Wolfie turned savage while Thatch turned nice, and Mickey and Monaco both turned smart. Casper, Thatch, Mickey and Monico had to find a way to reverse the effect without getting eaten by Wolfie. Wolfie once walked a mile in another's shoes when he turned into a human (\\"fleshie\\") and was banished from the school. Unfortunately, Alder & Dash plotted to turn him to stone, fearing he may reveal the secrets of Scare School to the humans. Luckily, Casper discovered that, by making Wolfie angry, he could become a Werewolf again. And Thatch, while insulting and scaring some other humans, got Wolfie angry when he had learned more about humans, and angrily stood up for them, bringing him back to his werewolf self, and he was allowed back in the school. He is voiced by Pat Fraley in the film, Johann Geoffrey Nelson in the first season and Matthew G√©czy in the second season. =Prof. Thurdigree Burns= Scare school's dragon science teacher who thinks sweat is \\"scare juice\\". His name is a play on words for \\"Third-degree burns\\" which are caused by fire or intense heat, which he is able to breathe at will. He has a tendency to bark untrue facts about \\"Fleshies\\" (the creatures' word for humans), which Casper politely tries to correct, which only aggravates Burns. He once attacked a restaurant with a Medieval theme, mistaking the employees and customers for actual knights as an act of revenge for his ancestors. But thanks to Casper, who'd come to \\"help\\" Burns, no one was injured and Burns got a satisfied \\"victory\\". He even saved Casper from expulsion at Alder & Dash's hands when they thought Casper had taken off, but Burns said Casper had been assisting him. He is voiced by Maurice LaMarche in the film and Matthew G√©czy in the second season. =Hedy Hopper= Scare school's history teacher who can be only seen in a crystal ball with her head floating together with a small table, and she possesses the power of Levitation. She greatly resembles Madame Leota of Haunted Mansion fame. She's in love with Frankengymteacher. Her name is probably a play on Hedda Hoppper‚Äôs. She is voiced by Debi Derryberry in the film, Goldie Zwiebel in the first season and Sharon Mann in the second season. =Frankengymteacher \\"Coach\\"= Scare school's Frankenstein gym teacher. His lightbulbs glow red by anger. He usually tries to teach the students to avoid angry villagers with torches, made as a reference to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but usually scares himself through a wall (literally). He's in love with Hedy Hopper. He is voiced by John DiMaggio in the film and Matthew G√©czy in the second season. =Cappy= Cappy is the captain of the flying pirate ship which provides the main form of transport between Scare School and the mortal world. His species is not revealed but judging by his skin color he is some sort of undead creature. He dresses in a traditional pirate costume, has a hook for a right hand and has eye patches in front of both his eyes given he is blind but he needs this blindness to use his special sensory powers to navigate the ship. He has a talking parrot called Beaky who is apparently more intelligent than he is and who often helps him. He is voiced by Maurice LaMarche in the film and Joe Sheridan in the first season. =The Gargoyles= The Gargoyles are somewhat of a security force for Scare School, as well as disciplinarians to the students. They also have a magic brew that turns whomever's dipped into it into a statue, which they usually use on Fleshies. Other characters =Mickey & Monaco= Mickey & Monaco are twins who are a, usually nice, pair of skeletons. The twins are Thatch's henchmen until in the end of the film. The make-up on the twins faces resembles Mexican Day of the Dead calavera. They're the show's example of vain stereotypical dumb cheerleader girls who always talk about make-up, their hair, and their weight even though they are just bones, etc. Mickey is blonde while Monaco dyed her hair pink. In the second season they are revealed to have the ability to share bones with each other and to control their bones when they are detached, like Mantha can with her body parts, although they find it easier when they are angry. Mickey is voiced by Candi Milo and Monaco is voiced by Nika Futterman in the film. In the first season, Shelley Shenoy voiced Mickey and Juanny Paulino voiced Monaco, and in the second season, both of them were voiced by Sharon Mann =The Cafeteria Thing= A purple monster that resembles an octopus who is usually seen in the cafeteria serving the students food at meal times. The only part of her seen on-screen most of the time are massive, magenta-purple tentacles and her dialog is restricted to shrieking and purring. Her whole body is first seen in the episode Disarmed and Dangerous when she is shocked by Mantha's temporary tentacle arm. She is sensitive to criticism as seen in Master Blist when Master Blister criticizes her which causes her to go berserk wrecking the school. She calms down when Alder praises her swamp burgers. =The Nurse= The Scare School Nurse is a Gorgon, evident by her snakes for hair, but her gaze doesn't turn people to stone. But that does not mean she isn't scary because she often prescribes painful or dangerous treatments for her patients, which she seemingly has no idea of the fear she instills. =The Sea Monster= The Sea Monster lives in the moat around Scare School. He's a long, purple, reptillian serpent with a dragonish head, but despite his monstrous demeanor he's actually friendly but pretends to be vicious. He's also friends with Casper. =Mosshead= Mosshead is usually a background character, and a part of Thatch's gang. Casper once invited him to his manor for vacation but he proved to too much of an annoyance, but he and Casper made amends. He also finds out Casper's friends with Jimmy. He seems to be some sort of swamp creature, speaks with a southern accent, and is always praising Thatch. He is voiced by Kevin Mahr in the first season and Matthew G√©czy in the second season. =Slither= A background character who is part of Thatch's gang. He appears to be Goth, and some kind of snake creature, hence his name. He has tentacles for arms, one of the few creatures that have tentacles. He has a crush on Dummy Girl. Slither and Dummy Girl's relationship were mentioned of romance in the Casper's Scare School franchise, as well as Mantha and Casper's relationship, only more friendship related. He is voiced by Matthew G√©czy in the second season. =Dummy Girl= A background character who is part of Thatch's gang. She's a living marionette/puppet/ventriloquist dummy. Her special \\"creature\\" power is her ability to be funny, although the other students said they wouldn't be able to tell if she lost it, meaning they probably don't think she's that funny. She has a crush on Slither. Speaks with a Brooklyn accent. Dummy Girl is voiced by Shelly Smith Shenoy in the first season and Sharon Mann in the second season. =Quasi= A background character who is basically your typical hunchback ogre monster. He is friends with Casper and gets stuck with the job of turning on and off the lights and ringing the school bell, the latter he hates doing. In one episode it is revealed that Quasi wants to be a professional ballet dancer but is unable to because he has two left feet. He speaks with a French accent. Quasi is inspired by Quasimodo from The Hunchback of Notre Dame. He is voiced by Johann Geoffrey Nelson in the first season and Matthew G√©czy in the second season. =Flyboy Maggoty= A background character who got stuck between the teacher's door. His name is mentioned by Ra. In one episode, his father told flyboy and his friends that he used to be human, and then tried changing himself and his son into humans but stopped after realizing that his son liked being a fly. Flyboy was voiced by Jason Harris in the film and Shelly Smith Shenoy in the TV series' second season. =Triclops= Triclops is a three-eyed shy girl, but is usually a background character. She was once a victim of Thatch, who was suffering a toothache, after he stuffed her in a cupboard. Although she is a background character, she is friends with Casper, Ra and Mantha. Triclops' first and only main role is in the episode \\"Triclops: Mistress of Dark\\" where she takes revenge of Thatch, Mickey and Monaco for their bullying and Alder & Dash for confiscating her balaclava and supposedly burning it. Triclops is voiced by Sharon Mann in the second season. =Pumpkinhead= A student with a jack-o-lantern for a head, usually a background character. Like Mantha, his head sometimes falls off. He can also breathe fire, but to a lesser extent than Prof. Thurdigree Burns. He is voiced by Scott Menville in the film and Matthew G√©czy in the second season. =Harpy= A female bird creature student and Ra's one-time girlfriend, usually a background character in which she is sometimes part of Thatch's gang. She first appears in the film, where she was in the Valley of the Shadows. She is shown to not usually speak, like the other students, with her dialogue limited to clucking, however she speaks in the second season. She dated Ra in a dance, initially too forceful, but with Casper, Mantha, and Wolfie's help, she and Ra were crowned the dance's king & queen, after displaying excellent dancing and teamwork. Harpy is voiced by Debi Derryberry in the film, Justin Pavia in the first season and Shelly Smith Shenoy in the second season. =Blodge= Blodge is a monster made of green slime who things can flow through similar to how Casper can go through walls. Without his flowing power his slime is clear as reveaved in Power Outage: Part 2 when his power is stolen. =Spitzy= Spitzy is the aunt of the Ghostly Trio and the great-aunt of Casper. She was banished to the Valley of the Shadows for being too friendly. She loves her nephews dearly. She often spits when she eats or drinks. Spitzy is voiced by Phyllis Diller in the film. =Bell and Murray \\"The Ancle\\"= Alder and Dash's aunt/uncle (ancle). Murray likes playing magic tricks and Bell loves singing. They look a lot like Alder and Dash except their clothes. Bell and Murray are voiced by Captain and Tennille who looks and sounds like them. =Banana Lady= She works at a grocery store dressed up as a banana giving free samples, first seen in the movie, she kept saying \\"banana cheese.\\" She's apparently not happy with her job. She got scared by Fatso, and later seen running from the Ghostly Trio. Once in the show she says \\"would you like a poo with that!\\" Banana Lady is voiced by Debi Derryberry in the film. =Razznik= A leprechaun and the servant of Kibosh, Razzik, sick n' tired of being treated like a slave, stole a crystal from Kibosh to steal the powers of the creatures in Scare School, stealing Thatch's power to turn into a bat, Heady's Levitation, Frankenteacher's Franken Strength, Burns's Fire-breathing, Wolfie's Werewolf powers, Mantha's Zombie powers, and scores more. But what he wanted was Ghost powers so no Creature would be able to escape him (A Ghost's Intanability), and take over the Underworld. The students figured out Razznik's weakness as a leprechaun: He must obey the one who gets his Pot of Gold at the End of the Rainbow. Exploiting this, the students stopped the greedy leprechaun and everything was set right while Razzik was imprisoned. =Norman= A bully who picks on Jimmy. His appearance seems inconsistent; he is either a brown mullet-haired boy (\\"What Possessed You?\\") or a blond skater (\\"Shrinky Dust\\" and \\"A Real Little Monster\\"), however both boys appear to be seen together (\\"Bands On The Run\\", \\"What Possessed You?\\" and \\"Power Outage Part 3\\") so its likely they have the same name. The mullet-haired Norman first appeared in the movie eating in the store, and was scared away by the Ghostly Trio. The blond Norman has a sister named Bethica who would stop him from bullying or threatens to tell their parents. The mullet-haired Norman appears to be pretty much aware of Casper's relationship with Mantha as he threatened to mail her head to China, which made Casper show him how to get back home (\\"What Possessed You?\\"). Comic exclusive characters =Jackie Hyde= A new student that appeared in the second story of the first issue (\\"The New Kid\\"). He may appear human, but in reality he becomes monstrous when frightened or angered. Jackie is somewhat a parody of Edward Hyde from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

He was 11 years old when he was shot and killed by loyalist Ebenezer Richardson in Boston on February 22, 1770. His funeral became a major political event, with his death heightening tensions that erupted into the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. Life The Bloody Massacre, Paul Revere's engraving of The Boston Massacre of March 1770. At background right, the Customs House has been renamed \\"Butcher's Hall\\" and a gun can be seen firing from a window, an oblique reference to the death of Seider Seider was born in 1758, the son of poor German immigrants. On February 22, 1770, he joined a crowd outside the house of Ebenezer Richardson in the North End. Richardson was a customs service employee who had tried to disperse a protest in front of the shop of Loyalist Theophilus Lillie. The crowd threw stones which broke Richardson's windows and struck his wife. Richardson fired a gun into the crowd, wounding Seider in the arm and the chest. The boy died that evening. Samuel Adams arranged for the funeral, which was attended by more than 2,000 people. He was buried in Granary Burying Ground; the victims of the Boston Massacre are buried near him. Seider's killing and large public funeral fueled public outrage which reached a peak in the Boston Massacre 11 days later. Richardson was convicted of murder that spring, but then received a royal pardon and a new job within the customs service on the grounds that he had acted in self- defense. This became a major American grievance against the British government. In popular culture Christopher's death, his funeral, and the subsequent Boston Massacre are featured in the 2015 television miniseries Sons of Liberty and season 2 of the 2016 television docuseries Legends & Lies: The Patriots.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5784268/ References * Zobel, Hiller B., The Boston Massacre, (1970, reissue 1996) W.

At its founding, Balanchine was the Artistic Director and Kirstein served as the Secretary. The president of Ballet Society is Nancy Lassalle, an original Board member of both the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet, currently Emerita.  History  The first performance took place on November 20, 1946 at the Central High School of Needle Trades in New York City. In its first season, it opened with The Four Temperaments and the Spellbound Child. Ballet Society's purpose was to develop an historical and pedagogical foundation for the art of ballet and dance. In its first two decades it received $200,000 in grants to research and expand the reach of ballet in the United States. With these funds Ballet Society published programs and held seminars and workshops with dance scholars, artists and dance teachers. It also commissioned and presented choreography by George Balanchine, Todd Bolender, Merce Cunningham, Lew Christensen, Francisco Moncion, and William Dollar.  School of American Ballet  Balanchine and Kirstein opened the School of American Ballet in 1934 before starting any of the ballet companies they went on to found over the years. Prior to and including 1946, when they began Ballet Society, Balanchine was able to utilize the dancers from his school for his ballets.  New York City Ballet  On April 28, 1948 Orpheus premiered at City Center, prompting Morton Baum, Chairman of the Finance Committee of City Center of Music & Drama, to invite Balanchine and Kirstein to establish a resident company, renamed the New York City Ballet. Once the dance company was given a stable home at New York City Center, Ballet Society continued to operate separately as a non-profit organization in the service of the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet, publishing dance books and developing and funding projects related to the sustenance and encouragement of dance in the United States, while continuing to commission new ballets.  Grants & Sponsorships  In 1949, Ballet Society received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation for $2500 for the completion of a book, published as The Classic Ballet: Basic Technique and Terminology, with a text by Muriel Stuart, illustrations by Carlus Dyer, and a foreword by George Balanchine. Lincoln Kirstin is credited with the historical development. This book remains in print today. In 1958 Ballet Society received two significant grants from the Ford Foundation: a) $25,000 to conduct a survey and evaluate the state of ballet training in America, and b) $1 50,000 for the purpose of establishing scholarships for students at the School of American Ballet over a three-year period (the San Francisco Ballet School, and five other ballet schools, also received significant funds from Ford Foundation at this time for the same purpose). These grants helped establish a strong foundation and best practices for teaching dance and supporting a merit system that allowed dance schools to recruit the most gifted dancers regardless of financial restrictions. In 1960 Ballet Society raised funds to implement a new program at the New York City Ballet. This program allowed for 3000 underprivileged children to come to a matinee performance of the ballet, meet the dancers and have exposure to live performance. The program continues to this day at the New York City Ballet. In 1961 Ballet Society sponsored a Teachers Seminar, based on the findings of the Ford Foundation grant survey, for the purpose of upholding the highest standard of excellence in the quality of teaching ballet across the country. George Balanchine presided over the seminar through lectures and demonstrations. Ballet school directors and teachers came from all over the country to participate. In 1964 Ballet Society received a $5000 grant from the New York State Council on the Arts to conduct lecture-demonstrations in high schools across New York City. Two teams of NYCB dancers, headed by Melissa Hayden and Edward Villella, delivered these lectures. In 1986 Ballet Society sponsored travel for 21 New York City Ballet dancers to attend the International Ballet Festival of Nervi in Italy, where they performed works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and Peter Martins. Through 1990‚Äì1995, Ballet Society sponsored two different museum exhibitions: Les Ballets 1933 at the National Dance Museum in Saratoga Springs in 1990, and in 1993 an exhibit called Art, Craft, Creativity in the Theatre Through the Costumes of Barbara Karinska. The exhibit was followed up two years later by a book, Costumes by Karinska, with a chronology compiled for Ballet Society by Edward Bigelow, a former dancer of the NYCB who met Karinska in 1947. In 2014, Ballet Society produced an interactive app on the Apple platform, to foster knowledge of Ballet's beginnings, history and evolution as told through its relationship with art, history and classicism.

Background In 1972, Public Press (a subsidiary of United Grain Growers) expanded its activities in commercial printing through acquisition of a web press, and hired Wallace, who had experience in selling such products. As Wallace was 46, he sought and received assurances that he would be treated fairly and have a guarantee of security in employment until at least his 65th birthday. Wallace was the company's top salesperson throughout his employment, which was terminated in 1986 without explanation. In a letter issued after termination, UGG claimed that \\"the main reason for his termination was his inability to perform his duties satisfactorily.\\"SCC, par. 6 The termination and allegation caused great emotional distress for Wallace, and he was unable to find similar employment elsewhere. Prior to his termination, Wallace had filed for bankruptcy in 1985, from which he was discharged in 1988. He sued UGG for wrongful dismissal, claiming: :* loss of income, including salary and commissions which would have been earned during the unexpired term of a fixed-term contract, or alternatively, :* such amounts that would have been earned under a period of reasonable notice, plus :* damages for mental distress or aggravated damages, punitive or exemplary damages and special damages. In its defense, UGG asserted: :* the dismissal was for cause (which was withdrawn on the opening day of the trial), :* the employment was not for a fixed term, and :* the claim with respect to mental distress was barred under Manitoba law relating to limitation of actions, as the description of its nature was inserted as an amendment made out of time. The courts below =Court of Queen's Bench= At the initial hearing, Lockwood J held that, as Wallace was an undischarged bankrupt, he had no capacity to commence an action on his own.(1992), 82 Man. R. (2d) 253 His appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal was stayed pending completion of the trial,(1993), 85 Man. R. (2d) 40 which was resumed subject to the outcome of the appeal on the bankruptcy issue.SCC, par. 9 In his resulting judgment, Lockwood J found that, subject to the above: :* the contract was not in the nature of a fixed term, as such a variation in company policy required the approval of the general manager, the president or the head of human resourcesMBQB, pp. 1214 :* in this case, a reasonable notice period for Wallace would be 24 months, with damages calculated accordingly,MBQB, p. 15 :* claims for mental distress were made both in contract and in tort,MBQB, pp. 1629 :* the restatement of the claim for mental distress was not made out of time, as it was a clarification made in consequence of Vorvis,MBQB, pp. 3031 and :* UGG's conduct was not sufficiently reprehensible to warrant an award of punitive damages.MBQB, pp. 3234 Accordingly, he awarded damages of $157,700 for wrongful dismissal and $15,000 as aggravated damages for mental distress. =Manitoba Court of Appeal= The Court allowed an appeal and cross-appeal. In his ruling Scott CJM held that: :* Wallace had capacity to sue in the matter, not on the basis that wages are exempt from property that vests in the trustee under Canadian bankruptcy law, but on the principle that property acquired after the date of bankruptcy does not automatically vest in the trustee in such a way as to prevent the bankrupt from maintaining an action.SCC, par. 23MBCA, pp. 1733 :* 15 months was a more reasonable period of notice, as 24 months was indicative of an element of aggravated damages having crept into the trial judge's determination,SCC, par. 28MBCA, pp. 3941 and :* aggravated damages did not apply. as Vorvis held that any damages beyond compensation for breach of contract for failure to give reasonable notice \\"must be founded on a separately actionable course of conduct.\\"SCC, par. 29MBCA, pp. 4951 Wallace appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada as to whether:SCC, par. 36 #a fixed-term contract existed, #the Court of Appeal erred in overturning the award for aggravated damages, #the appellant can sue in either contract or tort for \\"bad faith discharge\\", #the appellant was entitled to punitive damages, and #the Court of Appeal erred in reducing the appellant's reasonable notice damages from 24 to 15 months. UGG cross-appealed as to whether an undischarged bankrupt had capacity to sue in this matter.SCC, par. 36 At the Supreme Court of Canada In a 6‚Äì3 decision, the appeal was allowed. The Court unanimously dismissed the cross-appeal. =Cross-appeal= In contrast to the facts in Cohen, Wallace did not become involved in any good-faith transactions for value with a third party after his assignment in bankruptcy. Iacobucci J described damages arising from wrongful dismissal as forming part of the wages exemption under the Bankruptcy Act, stating: =Majority ruling in the appeal= In the appeal, Iacobucci J declared: :* the courts below did not err in holding that a fixed-term contract did not exist,SCC, par. 3871 :* where the manner of dismissal has caused mental distress but falls short of an independent actionable wrong, the trial judge has discretion to extend the period of reasonable notice to which an employee is entitled,SCC, par. 7374 :* an employee cannot sue in either tort or contract for \\"bad faith discharge\\", as the law does not recognize any requirement for good faith or fair dealing,SCC, par. 7678 :* there is no foundation for an award of punitive damages, as UGG did not engage in sufficiently \\"harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious\\" conduct for that to arise,SCC, par. 79 and :* the trial judge's award of 24 months was reasonable, as bad faith conduct in the manner of dismissal is another factor that is properly compensated for by an addition to the notice period.SCC, par. 80109 In expanding on the last point, he stated: =Dissent in the appeal= While agreeing with the majority in most respects, McLachlin J (as she then was) differed on two points: #An award of damages for wrongful dismissal should be confined to factors relevant to the prospect of finding replacement employment. It follows that the notice period upon which such damages are based should only be increased for manner of dismissal if this impacts on the employee's prospects of re-employment.SCC, par. 115132 #The law has evolved to permit recognition of an implied duty of good faith in termination of the employment.SCC, par. 136146 As a result, in addition to restoring damages for reasonable notice to 24 months, she would have also restored the award for aggravated damages. She explained her reasoning thus: Impact The increase in reasonable notice that was suggested by the SCC came to be known as the \\"Wallace bump,\\" and claims that included it became so frequent that the courts began to criticize the practice. It was subsequently restricted by the Court in Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays to the following circumstances: :* where damages are awarded for the conduct of the termination, they should not be awarded by extending the notice period, :* all damages arising out of the manner of dismissal should be recoverable if they arise from the circumstances set out in Wallace, but :* the damages awarded must reflect the actual damages sustained and not be an arbitrary extension of the notice period, :* damages for mental distress will be available, as long as they arise naturally from the contract breach and the manner of dismissal, and :* an independent actionable wrong will not give rise to punitive damages, as they will only arise where conduct is harsh, vindictive, reprehensible, malicious and extreme in nature. Most lawyers consider Wallace not to be dead, but to have evolved, and others point out that Keays damages may result in higher monetary awards in certain circumstances. Subsequent jurisprudence has identified several key areas where an employer's conduct will constitute bad faith that will attract Wallace damages: #Making false accusations, #Damaging the employee's prospects of finding another job, #Misrepresenting the reasons for termination, #Firing the employee to ensure deprivation of a benefit, and #Firing the employee in front of coworkers.

It combines research, documentation, and other techniques to achieve the diffusion and preservation of the art. Origin of the term The term was coined in 1955 by Spanish Argentine author Anselmo Gonz√°lez Clement in a publication of the same year utilizing the term as its title. The Real Academia Espa√±ola included the term in a revision of the Spanish dictionary through the efforts of the Granadine writer Luis Rosales. The term was diffused as early as 1958 by a group of erudites known as the C√°tedra de Jerez in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. Institutionalization The Discipline is institutionalized throughout the Andaluc√≠a region in southern Spain. Institutions such as the Universidad de Sevilla (University of Seville) and the Universidad de C√≥rdoba (C√≥rdoba University) offer specialization in this discipline. In Modern Practice The discipline is put into practice through various publications or lectures. Some examples of publications are Revista Alma 100, Revista El Olivo, and Flamenco World.com. Propagation The extent to which the discipline is practiced varies on the growth of general knowledge of the Flamenco arts. Since the beginning, it has been the purpose of Flamencologists to diffuse the art both locally and abroad, and with the diffusion of the art later come the methods of documenting and researching the art thus putting Flamencology into practice. In practice, people are first exposed to Flamenco as an art be it music or dance. This can be either inherited through family ties or acquired by an aficionado. As in other disciplines, first comes the practice then comes the analysis, methods, techniques, and theory related to an \\"ology\\". The e has become more formal and taken root outside of Spain, wherever the art is cultivated to the point that documentation can be performed on relevant topics related to respective regions. Countries such as Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico have reached this point with Chilean writers contributing to Flamenco publications in Spain and Chile and in Mexico with the creation of the Instituto Mexicano de Flamencolog√≠a. In 2005 Argentina, held its first \\"Jornada de Flamencolog√≠a\\" with a number of lectures.

In 1988 Ingersoll Publications purchased The Alton Telegraph and Mississippi Valley Offset, where the paper would be printed. Ingersoll Publications Company announced its Post-Dispatch competitor in March 1989. The tabloid newspaper would be modeled after other papers such as the Rocky Mountain News and Barron's. The Sun began publishing on September 25 with Ingersoll as editor in chief. The paper was the first American metropolitan daily since The Washington Times was published in 1982. For the first three months of 1990, the newspaper claimed sales averaging over 100,000 a day. The Sun earned much local notoriety for a full-tabloid-page headline which read \\"He Bit Hers, She Sued His\\", which had to do with a lawsuit by a woman against a man who bit her buttocks. Growth of the Sun's circulation nonetheless fell short of the company's expectations in the critical month of April. The paper's business strategy backfired, cannibalizing ad revenues at its sister publication, the Suburban Journals. Ingersoll announced the newspaper's closure April 25, 1990, the newspaper's last edition.

They are considered one of the \\"Casane Astigiane\\", the major familial banking \\"houses\\" that powered the economy of medioeval Asti. Their accession to noble status can be traced to their increased wealth through banking, lending and property investment, starting in the 11th and 12th centuries. They were renowned as Ghibelline supporters throughout the Middle Ages. Their economic prestige dropped at the end of the 16th century and the family eventually fell from nobility.la famiglia Turco Origins The noted historian Napione relates the family to the birth of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, affirming that Gherardo Turco, signore of Tonco, was among the founders of the order in 1084. In 1189 Riccardo Turco became the successor to the first English Prior of the Knights Hospitaller.Araldica AstigianaTurco United in hospitium as \\"De Castello\\" with the influential ghibelline Isnardi and Guttuari families, they became one of Asti's major patrician families. By the early 12th century, Turco family members became lords (signori) of Serralunga, Malamorte, Neive, Barbaresco, Monfalcone, Sarmatorio and Manzano. By the end of the 12th century, they also became lords of Tonco and Frinco. The family's first renowned individual was Giovanni Turco, who in 1278 appears as the lieutenant (luogotenente) to the podest√† Mellano Solaro. Of note was also Guglielmo Turco, who in 1300 reportedly murdered Emanuele Solaro, to vindicate the guelf government, starting a new phase of the civil war. Once peace was restored in 1309, Guglielmo was sent off in exile. The first member of notable economic activity was Palmerone Turco, who established banks in Savoy (Thonon and Sembrancher) between 1335 and 1363.A.M. Patrone, Le Casane astigiane in Savoia, Dep. Subalpina di storia patria, Torino 1959 Giovanni Turco, son of Antonio, became the General Capitain of the March of Montferrat, but he was accused of cowardliness and was hanged in Moncalvo in 1430. Della Chiesa writes that in the 17th century, \\"the family fell in disgrace and was forced to relinquish its properties, maintaining however its titles of nobility. A count Turco is cited in 1906, as \\"the possessor of an ancient feudal mill once owned by the family\\".Gabiani N., Le torri le case-forti ed i palazzi nobili medievali in Asti,Pinerolo, 1906, pg. 89 Family crest Composed of a silver shield with a black eagle, with a golden crown. The motto reads \\"la virt√π pu√≤ accompagnarsi alla buona fortuna\\" (Virtue will bring good fortune). Economic and feudal activities The Turco's economic rise began locally in the early 12th century where through financial gains they increased their land holdings and expanded serfdom. By 1270 they began to operate at an international level, receiving privileges in Flanders (in particular the towns of Valenciennes, Binche and Maubeuge), and in Savoy, and by lending to the Counts of Hainaut and Namur. In 1342 Antonio and Turchetto Turco took over Frinco from the Pelletta family, as well as the castle in Montemagno from the comune of Asti. In 1375 Antonio Turco expanded his feudal holdings. Oliviero Turco was given lordship of Revigliasco from the marquis of Monferrato in 1367, however he was forced to abdicate when it was restored to Asti. A branch of the family established itself in Flanders at Hainaut where, in 1337, Rolando Turco de Castello acquired the lordship of Iwuy. As Asti's control by the Angevin Kingdom of Naples began to be challenged by the Visconti of Milan in the 14th century, a branch of the family established itself in Naples under the auspices of Queen Joan I, with some venturing to take positions in Calabria.cfr. Giovanni Fiore, Della Calabria illustrata opera varia istorica del r.p. Giovanni Fiore da Cropani, predicatore, lettore di sacra teologia, Naples, 1691-1743, Book II, p. 249 In 1431 Pietrino Turco was given rights to Quattordio by Filippo Maria Visconti. By the end of the 16th century the dynasty of the Turco family began to lose economic prestige and, eventually, they fell from nobility. Turco in Verona It is not clear if the Turco family of Verona is connected with the family of Asti. Nonetheless, in 1393 the Turco family was invested with the title in Visegna (Salizzole) and, a few years later, the church of S. Caterina di Alessandria was constructed. There were four families which in the seicento that owned property in Bionde di Visegna and were titled as having jurisdiction.Comune di Salizzole See also * Asti * Casane Astigiane References External links * La famiglia Turco * Storia di Asti, i Turco * The Turco Family Category:Italian families Category:People from Asti Category:Banking families ","title":"Turco (family)"},{"id":"13883261","text":"Abdul Aziz ibn Saud may refer to: *Abdul-Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud (died 1803), second imam (leader) of the First Saudi State * Abdulaziz ibn Abdul Rahman Al Saud (1876‚Äì1953), known as Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, founder and first king of modern-day Saudi Arabia ","title":"Abdul Aziz bin Saud"},{"id":"13883263","text":"The beginning of the work's score, with its unusual tempo and time signature Comme le vent (Like the wind) is the first of the √âtudes in the minor keys, Op. 39 for solo piano by the French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan.

This list of prehistoric sponges is an attempt to create a comprehensive listing of all genera that have ever been included in the phylum Porifera, excluding purely vernacular terms. The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (nomina dubia), or were not formally published (nomina nuda), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered to be sponges. Naming conventions and terminology Naming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include: * Junior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen. *Nomen nudum (Latin for \\"naked name\\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen. *Nomen oblitum (Latin for \\"forgotten name\\"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal. *Preoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list. *Nomen dubium (Latin for \\"dubious name\\"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list. { id=\\"toc\\" border=\\"0\\" ! :  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  See also } A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  References  Prehistoric sponges List ","title":"List of prehistoric sponge genera"},{"id":"13883375","text":"Crossman Pond is a pond in Kingston, Massachusetts, located off Wapping Road (Route 106) and South Street.

A partial capo may appear to have a similar effect to alternate tunings, but there are differences. A common example is a capo which covers the top five strings of a guitar, leaving the bass E string uncapoed. When played at the second fret, this appears to create a drop D tuning (where the bass E string is tuned to a D) raised one full tone in pitch. In fact, these are often marketed as \\"drop D capos\\". However, this affects only the open tuning of the strings, and thus, when used at the second fret, an E chord using the \\"D shape\\" will have the \\"Drop D sound\\" with a low E note. However, a G-shape chord can be played as well, as the fretted E string will not be affected as it would be if the string was retuned. Background Various kinds of partial capos A capo is a tool which clamps across all the strings of a string instriment, to raise the pitch of all the strings. This is done to achieve a brighter timbre, or to transpose the music to a higher key. Guitarists have also used many alternate tunings to change the pitch of the open (unfretted) strings. Recently, guitarists have begun to use capos that only clamp some of the strings, usually called a \\"partial capo\\", which offer similar options to guitarists as alternate tunings, with drone strings and new chord voicings. Although partial capos are most commonly used in standard tuning, creating \\"simulated\\" open tunings, they are also used in combination with many different tunings, and are also combined with other full and partial capos. A number of manufacturers incorrectly call them \\"open tuning\\" capos. What they do for the guitar resembles what a tuning does, but the open strings are changed by varying the length of the strings and not the pitch. Origins A six-string Planet Waves capo and a homemade \\"cut\\" version A device similar to the partial capo surfaced in Europe in the early 19th century, but that seems to have died out and is likely unconnected to contemporary partial capo use. Modern use of the idea does not turn up before the 1960s. There are unconfirmed anecdotes from the 1960s and 1970s indicating that some people may have started to use some basic kinds of partial capos. \\"5th string capos\\", commonly used by banjo players, are a type of partial capo. Manufacture The first partial capo for guitar released, in 1976, was called the \\"Chord- Forming Capo\\". It was invented by Lyle Shabram, and called \\"A Tool For the Creative Musician\\". Harvey Reid and Jeff Hickey started the Third Hand Capo Co. in Nashville, renaming Shabram's invention \\"Third Hand Capo\\". A popular style of partial capo is the \\"Esus\\" style, which clamps the A, D, and G strings of a guitar. When placed upon the second fret, it forms an Esus chord, and when turned upside down, it forms an A chord. There are many partial capos on the market today that clamp anywhere from 1 to 5 strings. Many musicians have made their own partial capos by cutting or otherwise modifying existing capos. The Third Hand Capo and the SpiderCapo (appearing in 2008) are the only universal capos. Each can clamp any of the 63 combinations of strings at any fret of any guitar. Only the SpiderCapo can produce any combination at a given fret without repositioning the capo. Shubb and Kyser each make a 3-string \\"E-sus\\" capo as well as a 5-string \\"Drop-E\\" capo. Woodie's G-Band capos clamp 1 or 2 outer strings, and Kyser now makes a series of \\"K-Lever\\" capos that incorporate a spring lever to allow temporary fretting of some notes that lie under the capo. Harvey Reid Guitarist and songwriter Harvey Reid is a prominent partial capo popularizer. He pioneered most of the known capo configurations, wrote books, and composed and recorded songs using partial capo. Reid published a book in 1980, A New Frontier in Guitar, detailing 25 ways to use a Third Hand Capo, at the time the only partial capo on the market. Reid recorded 2 albums in 1982 and 1983 in Washington DC, which were the first commercial recordings to use the partial capo, and he published the Duck Soup Guitar book in 1982, which was the first published use of the partial capo in music education. Sleight of Hand: Guitar Magic followed in 1983, and was the first book of solo guitar arrangements for partial capoed guitar. Both books are still in print. Reid also co-wrote the first college textbook for folk guitar, Modern Folk Guitar, which has been in print since 1984 and is used in university music education and music therapy programs. It contains a chapter on using the partial capo for beginning guitar.

Christian August of Saxe-Zeitz was a Teutonic Knight, the Primas of Hungary and finally a cardinal. On 22 May 1712 he crowned Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor as the King of Hungary and on 18 October 1714 also his wife Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in St. Martin's Cathedral.  Life  He was the third (but second surviving) son of Maurice, Duke of Saxe-Zeitz, and his second wife, Dorothea Maria of Saxe-Weimar. A Teutonic Knight, he converted to Catholicism in 1696 and became Provost of Cologne (1696‚Äì1725), then Bishop of Raab (1696‚Äì1725) and finally on 17 May 1706 was created a Cardinal by Pope Clement XI. He was chosen to convert his kinsman, the King-Elector August the Strong of Poland to the Catholic faith. Christian August instructed him secretly and on 1 June 1697 baptized him secretly in the Court Chapel (Hofkapelle) in Baden bei Wien, then publicly and solemnly in the German Piekar in Oppeln. When the conversion was finally formalized, Christian August issued a certificate to the king, which was authenticated by the Papal nunzio. In 1707 Christian August was elected Archbishop of Esztergom (Gran) and consequently, Primas of Hungary. He used the office of a deputy of the Emperor as Principal Commissioner (Prinzipalkommissar) in the Perpetual Imperial Diet (Reichstag) of Regensburg. On the occasion of the victory over the Turks in Belgrade in 1717 Christian August, as representative of the Emperor Charles VI, organized a magnificent celebration in the Imperial Diet realm. During the festivities, the Order of St. Emmeram was created in the knight's hall on 26 October. The death of his brother Maurice Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Zeitz, on 15 November 1718 without surviving male issue, made him heir to the duchy of Saxe-Zeitz, but because he took the monastic vows (and the next in line to the inheritance, Christian August's nephew Maurice Adolf, was also a priest), Zeitz was merged into the Electorate of Saxony in accordance with the will of Elector Johann Georg I.  Death  Christian August of Saxe-Zeitz died on 23 August 1725 in Regensburg. He is buried in the crypts of St. Martin's Cathedral in Bratislava the capital of present-day Slovakia.

It was designed by PTC Therapeutics. Medical use Ataluren is used in the European Union to treat people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who have a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene, can walk, and are more than five years old. Contraindications People who are pregnant or breast feeding should not take ataluren. Adverse effects More than 10% of people taking ataluren in clinical trials experienced vomiting; more than 5% experienced diarrhea, nausea, headache, upper abdominal pain, and flatulence; between 1% and 5% of people experienced decreased appetite and weight loss, high levels of triglycerides, high blood pressure, cough, nosebleeds, abdominal discomfort, constipation, rashes, pain in their arms, legs, and chest muscles, blood in their urine, urinary incontinence, and fever. Interactions Aminoglycosides should not be given to someone taking ataluren, as they interfere with its mechanism of action. Caution should be used with drugs that induce UGT1A9, or that are substrates of OAT1, OAT3, or OATP1B3. Pharmacology While a large number of studies failed to identify the biological target of ataluren, it was discovered to bind and stabilize firefly luciferase, thus explaining the mechanism by which it created a false positive effect on the read through assay. Ataluren is thought to make ribosomes less sensitive to premature stop codons (an effect referred to as \\"read-through\\") by promoting insertion of certain near-cognate tRNA at the site of nonsense codons with no apparent effects on downstream transcription, mRNA processing, stability of the mRNA or the resultant protein, thereby making a functional protein similar to the non-mutated endogenous product. It seems to work particularly well for the stop codon 'UGA'. Studies have demonstrated that ataluren treatment increases expression of full-length dystrophin protein in human and mouse primary muscle cells containing the premature stop codon mutation for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and rescues striated muscle function. Studies in mice with the premature stop codon mutation for cystic fibrosis demonstrated increased CFTR protein production and function. Extending on this work, a mechanistic study with yeast and human cells has elucidated the details of ataluren-mediated nonstandard codon-anticodon base pairings which result in specific amino acid substitutions at specific codon positions in the CFTR protein. The European Medicines Agency review on the approval of ataluren concluded that \\"the non- clinical data available were considered sufficient to support the proposed mechanism of action and to alleviate earlier concerns on the selectivity of ataluren for premature stop codons.\\" Chemistry Ataluren is an oxadiazole; its chemical name is 3-[5-(2-Fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl]benzoic acid. History Ataluren was discovered by scientists at PTC Therapeutics in a collaboration with Lee Sweeney's lab at the University of Pennsylvania, which was initially funded in part by Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy. The team used phenotypic screening of a chemical library to identify compounds that increased the amount of protein expressed by mutated genes, and then optimized one of the hits in the screen to create this drug. As with the results of many cell-based screens, the biological target of ataluren is not known. Phase I clinical trials started in 2004. In 2010, PTC Therapeutics released preliminary results of its phase 2b clinical trial for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with participants not showing a significant improvement in the six minute walk distance after the 48 weeks of the trial. This failure resulted in the termination of a $100 million deal with Genzyme to pursue the drug. In May 2014, ataluren received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and received market authorization from the European Commission to treat people with nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy in August 2014; a confirmatory phase III clinical trial was required. By December it was on the market in Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, Spain and a number of other European Union countries. In February 2016, FDA declined to accept PTC Therapeutics new drug application for ataluren, which was based on a clinical trial in which ataluren missed its primary endpoint; PTC appealed and the FDA declined again in October 2016. In July 2016, NHS England agreed a Managed Access Agreement (MAA) for Translarna providing reimbursed patient access to Translarna in England via a five-year MAA. This followed a positive recommendation from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in April 2016, subject to PTC and NHS England finalizing the terms of the MAA. NICE issued its final guidance later in July with implementation of the MAA for patients following within two months. In March 2017, PTC terminated development of ataluren for cystic fibrosis due to lack of efficacy in the Phase III trials.

The decree was issued by the Governor of the Province of Quebec, Frederick Haldimand, on October 25, 1784, three days after the Treaty of Fort Stanwix was signed between others of the Six Nations and the American government. Proclamation text The text of the proclamation reads: > Whereas His Majesty having been pleased to direct that in consideration of > the early attachment to his cause manifested by the Mohawk Indians, and of > the loss of their settlement which they thereby sustained that a > convenient tract of land under his protection should be chosen as a safe and > comfortable retreat for them and others of the Six Nations, who have either > lost their settlements within the Territory of the American States, or wish > to retire from them to the British  I have at the earnest desire of many > of these His Majesty's faithful Allies purchased a tract of land from the > Indians situated between the Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron and I do hereby > in His Majesty's name authorize and permit the said Mohawk Nation and such > others of the Six Nation Indians as wish to settle in that quarter to take > possession of and settle upon the Banks of the River commonly called Ours > [Ouse] or Grand River, running into Lake Erie, allotting to them for that > purpose six miles deep from each side of the river beginning at Lake Erie > and extending in that proportion to the head of the said river, which them > and their posterity are to enjoy for ever.\\" > Given under my hand and seal at arms, at the Castle of St Lewis at Quebec, > this twenty-fifth day of October one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four > and in the twenty-fifth year of the reign of Our Sovereign Lord George The > Third by the Grace of God of Great Britain, France and Ireland, King, > Defender of the Faith and so forth. > Fredk Haldimand > By His Excellency's Command > R. Mathews Background Joseph Brant and Guy Johnson, who had been ejected from his post as Superintendent of Indian Affairs a few months before, traveled to London, England in November 1775, on the eve of the American Revolution, to obtain a promise from the Crown that if the Iroquois fought on the British side, they would obtain a land grant in Canada. During and after the American Revolution, American colonists confiscated land and property from those who were Loyalists during the war. The British government compensated both Indian and non-Indian Loyalists with cash payments for their losses. By early 1783, Brant had selected the valley of the Grand River as a place of settlement; in 1784 Frederick Haldimand agreed. The land was acquired from the Mississaugas in May 1784, with Lieutenant-Colonel John Butler acting as an agent of purchase on behalf of the government. Later, the Crown adopted the position that it had failed to obtain title to the entire valley at the time of its purchase from the Mississaugas. Interpretation =Nature of the grant= On April 26, 1784, Frederick Haldimand wrote: \\"The mode of acquiring lands by what is called Deeds of Gift is to be entirely discontinued, for, by the King's instructions, no Private Person, Society, Corporation or colony is capable of acquiring any property in lands belonging to the Indians, either by purchase, or grant or conveyance from the Indians, excepting only where the lands lie within the limits of any colony the soil of which has been vested in Proprietaries or Corporations by grants from the Crown; in which cases such Proprietaries or Corporations only shall be capable of acquiring such property by purchase or grants from the Indians.\\"Cases Decided on the British North America Act, 1867... Government officials originally interpreted the grant as prohibiting the Indians from leasing or selling the land to anyone but the government. Joseph Brant countered that Haldimand had promised the Indians freehold land tenure equal to that enjoyed by the colony's Loyalist settlers. As freeholders, the Indians could lease or sell land to the highest bidder. In 1793, Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe stated that the Indians could not lease their land since British subjects could lease land only from British subjects. Brant considered the right to lease or sell land as a litmus test for Indian sovereignty. The Crown said that the grant was for all members of the Six Nations, but Brant said the land should be only for members of the Six Nations who lived on the land. =Extent of the lands= Thomas Ridout survey of 1821 Although the overall limits of the lands mentioned in the proclamation were clearly defined, \\"extending in that proportion to the head of the said river\\", the Crown contended that the grant was limited by the extent of land they had previously purchased and that they could not grant land which they did not already own. In May 1784, Haldimand had purchased a tract of land from the Mississaugas, which was referred to in the grant as generally \\"situated between the Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron\\". In fact, the head of the Grand River is located some thirty miles beyond the limits of land that the Crown maintained that it had previously purchased from the Mississaugas. In 1791, at the request of the Six Nations, an initial survey was completed. It was agreed between Joseph Brant, Henry Tekarihoga, and other chiefs with the Nassau District land board that the middle of the grant should not follow the exact windings of the river, but that it should be drawn from an easterly bend near the river's mouth straight to the Mohawk village. Although the government alleges that the Six Nations agreed to the accuracy of the information gathered during the 1791 survey, the resulting documentation in the form of a map signed by the Land Board and the Six Nation chiefs was subsequently \\"believed lost or destroyed\\". The Crown's position was that the extent of the land was as determined in the subsequent Thomas Ridout survey of 1821, drawing a northern boundary near the present location of Elora, Ontario, referred to at the time of the survey as \\"The Falls\\". In this survey, the size of the grant was described as As early as July 4, 1819, Six Nations chief John Brant (Tekarihoga), son of Joseph Brant, in a speech at a council held near present- day Hamilton, Ontario to deal with land issues, stated, \\"We are surprised to find that [the] Government says that we own the Lands to the Falls only as we have the Writings to prove otherwise.

It was built from 1858 to 1860 and is one of the best preserved examples of Richard Upjohn's distinctive asymmetrical Italian villa style. It is the only surviving residential example of Upjohn's Italian villa style that was especially designed to suit the Southern climate and the plantation lifestyle. It has a massive four-story tower, windows of variable size and shape with brownstone trim, and a distinctly Southern division of family and public spaces. The building was designed and constructed for Edward Kenworthy Carlisle as his primary family residence and the centerpiece of his estate. It, along with some of its surrounding ancillary structures, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2004. The house and a purported ghost are featured as a short story in Kathryn Tucker Windham's 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey. History Edward Kenworthy Carlisle was born in 1810 near Augusta, Georgia. He migrated with his mother, Susan Curry Carlisle, to Perry County, Alabama as a young man. His mother had family members who were established cotton planters in the area. He married Lucinda Wilson Walthall in 1841. Carlisle eventually became a large landholder and also established himself as a cotton factor. In 1858 he decided to build an estate indicative of his family's Black Belt social standing. He first wrote to Upjohn on 4 May 1858 in a letter that stated \\"Desiring to build a house, a country residence, and at a loss for a plan, we address you as a well known Architect to ask you to draw us a plan, a rough sketch at first, which we hope may result in a suitable plan.\\" The plans for Kenworthy Hall evolved over the course of the next several months, with the plans continuing to be worked on through correspondence even as the brownstone trim, shipped from New York, began to arrive at the site. Carlisle had difficulty in finding labor skilled enough for such an ambitious house, but he finally found a master mason, Philip Bond, in November 1858 and work then commenced. Bond estimated that the brickwork would be completed by June 1859. The family had moved into the house by 1860. Architectural watercolor of Kenworthy Hall done in 1858 by Upjohn's firm. Note the design for the original front porch. The American Civil War arrived in 1861 and Carlisle continued to have success in his many business ventures. One of his cotton trading firms, Carlisle and Humphries, actually saw profits increase during the Union blockade. His fortunes abruptly changed after the war, however, and his taxable property was valued at less than $20,000. The Kenworthy Hall property itself was valued at only $9000 in 1867. He entered into a business relationship in nearby Selma with his son, Edward Carlisle, Jr., and his son-in-law, Alexander Jones. They went on to found the City National Bank in 1871. Carlisle then died in 1873, leaving the property to his wife, Lucinda, who divided her time between it and a home in Selma. She increasingly used Kenworthy as a summer residence only and gave it to her only surviving child, Augusta Carlisle Jones, in 1899. Lucinda died in 1912 and in 1914 Augusta sold the property. The property went through a series of owners after that and went into a general decline. The house lost both of the original porches during this period. The house had various times that it stood vacant. The house was completely vacant for much of the 1950s and experienced a great deal of vandalism. It was at that time that the plasterwork was mutilated, many marble mantles were broken, and the stained glass destroyed, though it all had been partially documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1934. During these various periods of vacancy the local population began to tell stories of the house being haunted and one of these stories was later recorded by Kathryn Tucker Windham in a short story entitled \\"The Faithful Vigil at Carlisle Hall,\\" which she printed in her first book of ghost stories, 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey. The story involves the purported ghost of a young woman in the fourth floor tower room, who awaits the return of her lover. The house and was purchased by Karen Klassen of Birmingham for $4000 in 1957 and for the next decade she did what she could to restore the house. In 1967 the Martin family bought the property and spent the next thirty years restoring it. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 and the Historic American Buildings Survey spent the part of the summer in 1997 preparing drawings and taking new photographs. The Martins both died not long afterwards. The Martin heirs sold the house in 2001 to a new family. The house, along with four surviving ancillary structures, was declared a National Historic Landmark on August 18, 2004. Description Front elevation of Kenworthy Hall in 1934. Kenworthy Hall is closely related to a series of Italian villa style residences that Upjohn designed in the Atlantic Northeast, most notably the Edward King House in Newport, Rhode Island. But in this house Upjohn designed a residence adapted to a hot, humid climate and a plantation lifestyle. The most obvious adaptations were the wide cross hall at the rear of the main entrance hall, the detached kitchen, and the full width rear porch. Edward Carlisle's correspondence with Upjohn stressed that the house use the finest materials and the best construction. The house is built in brick, including the interior walls. The original standing-seam terne roof survives to the present. Kenworthy Hall features a partial basement, three separate stairways, three large hallways, seven major rooms on the first floor, six major rooms on the second floor, a large attic, a third floor tower room, and a fourth floor tower room. Ancillary structures that contribute to the National Historic Landmark status of the house include the detached two-room brick kitchen, a brick smokehouse, a partially buried brick water cistern, and a brick and wood well house. The house also originally had its own gas plant for gas lighting, though this is now marked only by a brick and brownstone platform. Rear elevation of Kenworthy Hall in 1934. View of the entrance hall, a portion of the cross hall, and the main staircase. The exterior walls of the house are built from a dull red brick that was locally made. The bricks are laid in a stretcher bond pattern, with belt courses of brownstone above the foundation and at each floor level. The windows on the house, all sixty-four of them, feature brownstone headers and windowsills. Most of them, except for those under the original first floor porches and in the kitchen building, feature round or segmental arches. Brick panels are inserted below the windowsills of the parlor, sitting room, and all twelve of the fourth-floor tower windows. The tower features a bracketed balcony at the second floor level, with a metal canopy roof. This type of balcony was a signature of Upjohn's Italian villa style. The roof is a low- pitched hipped and truncated structure with wide eaves. The eaves have an overhang of three feet and are decorated by flat wooden brackets. Two skylights, original to the house, are mounted on the flat portion of the roof. The roof also features four brick chimneys, capped with brownstone and serving twelve fireplaces. The original porches, both originally referred to as piazzas, featured multiple arched wooden bays separated and supported by miniature Corinthian columns on pedestals. The front piazza was replaced by a far simpler structure after 1912, the rear one was taken down in the 1940s and was never rebuilt. Some of the components were stored at that time and have survived, with reconstruction contemplated by the current owners. The rear piazza originally connected to the detached kitchen by means of an elevated covered walkway, of a slightly simpler design than the piazzas. The main entrance doors are set into a Serliana brownstone arch. The doors are set under an arched glass fanlight with the sidelights placed in straight-topped transoms to either side. The front of the house also has a \\"family\\" entrance to the left of the tower, entered through a small arched loggia. The rear elevation has a centrally placed set of entry doors that enter the building behind the main staircase. The rear of the house also has an exterior service entry that opens into the servant's hallway and staircase. An extensive use was made in the interior of decoratively carved cabinetry, oak moldings, decorative plasterwork, and one of the Deep South's first uses of ornamental stained glass. The stained glass is believed to have been produced by an early American ornamental stained glass company, that of Henry Sharp and Company of New York City. It was featured in the arched transom and sidelights of the main doors, as well as the large arched window over the main staircase landing. The glass was destroyed by vandals in the 1950s, as was many of the plasterwork ceiling medallions. The entire house has original heart pine floors. Built-in bookcases in the library. The ground floor features a by entrance hall that is joined to form a T-shape with a cross hall at the back measuring 13 feet wide and 27 feet long. The cross hall is centered on the main oak staircase. Both halls employ large ornamental oak arches to visually define the spaces. The parlor is entered from the right side of the entrance hall and has an ornate plasterwork cornice with a central ceiling medallion. It measures roughly 18 by 26 feet. The sitting room is across the hall on the left and measures 18 by 18 feet. The octagonal library is entered from the east end of the cross hall. The library is furnished by a pair of built-in arched bookcases, features an elaborately molded plasterwork cornice, and measures roughly 18 by 22 feet. The dining room is on the opposite end of the cross hall and is the same size as the parlor. Other rooms on this floor include the smoking room, sewing room, a large butler's pantry and adjacent storage room. The upstairs cross hall. In addition to the main staircase, there is a servant's hall with its own staircase and an elliptical family staircase just off of the family entrance. The second floor features a central cross hall that corresponds exactly to the one below. Around it are clustered an upstairs sitting room, five bedrooms, and a linen room. The upstairs sitting room has a small adjoining chamber and direct access to the servant's staircase. Two of the front bedrooms have large adjoining dressing rooms that are original to the plan. A large trunk room between the upstairs family hall and the two front bedrooms has been converted into a bathroom. The family staircase on this floor continues up to a landing that opens into a former servants room measuring roughly 19 by 19 feet on the third floor of the tower. This landing also has an entrance door into the attic. The fourth floor tower is accessed by a straight flight of stairs located just outside the servants room and the third floor landing. This room measures the same as the servant's room below and has three arched casement windows on each wall for a total of twelve.

The marten was listed as endangered by the COSEWIC in 2001 and has been protected since 1934, however the population still declines. The Newfoundland marten has been geographically and reproductively isolated from the mainland marten population for 7000 years. The Newfoundland pine marten is similar in appearance to its continental cousin, but is slightly larger, with dark brown fur with an orange/yellow patch on the throat. Females are an average weight of 772 grams and males have an average weight of 1275 grams. The Newfoundland subspecies is also observed to inhabit a wider range of forest types than its mainland counterparts. The population characteristics suggest that the Newfoundland marten is a product of unique ecological setting and evolutionary selective factors acting on the isolated island population. The Newfoundland pine marten is omnivorous, feeding on mainly small mammals, along with birds, old carcasses, insects and fruits; it is currently found in suitable pockets of mature forest habitat, on the west coast of Newfoundland and in and around Terra Nova National Park. The Pine Marten Study Area (PMSA) is located in southwestern Newfoundland and is a 2078 km2 wildlife reserve that was created in 1973 to protect the Newfoundland Marten. Habitat The Newfoundland marten range is now condensed into approximately 13,000 square kilometers in the western part of the island, with a large portion of key habitat in the Little Grand Lake area. Due to the unregulated pulpwood harvest during the last century, the forest age-class distribution is skewed to the younger regeneration stage of forest succession, which led to the majority of the island being contiguous blocks of second-growth forest. The behavioral patterns of habitat use by Newfoundland martens are altered by the ecological conditions of low prey biomass and high natural forest fragmentation that occur in Newfoundland. A wide spectrum of habitat types are used throughout the geographic range, however, it has been found the Newfoundland Marten has a strong association with old successional forest. Old-growth forest is defined as unharvested stands that are older than 80 years of age. The stand-scale habitat use includes mature coniferous forest being the dominant cover types used proportionately more than the availability, along with coniferous scrub and insect-defoliated stands used in proportion to the availability, whereas open areas and fire disturbed area are avoided. However, the fire disturbance is minimized because of the lack of prolonged dry periods on the island. Due to infrequent fires, the episodic defoliation by the spruce budworm and hemlock looper are the primary form of natural stand-replacing disturbance. Newfoundland martens have a preference to mature (61‚Äì80 years old) and over mature (>80 years old) coniferous stands since it is critical for foraging habitat. More recent studies have found that martens will use forests with a variety of height and canopy closure conditions creating a wider variety of habitat types than previously thought; this variety includes areas that are disturbed by insects, mid-successional forests, precommercially thinned forests, along with the areas of mature and overmature forests. Home range requirements for the Newfoundland Marten are extremely large due to the larger body size. Males hold larger home-ranges (29.54 km2) than females (15.19 km2) which are significantly larger than other species of martens across most of the geographic range. These larger home-ranges reflect the larger body sizes and the lower diversity and abundance of prey. Martens will also adjust their behavior and home-ranges to suit the habitat needs since the average home- range of the marten is typically larger than the average defoliate parch size and therefore will need to adjust for defoliation disturbance. Newfoundland martens are also intrasexually territorial and show home-range fidelity. Home- range size have variation between years for both sexes based on the changes in the food abundance as well as the individual's ability to obtain their prey. Within the year, martens may modify their movements during the winter because it is an additional energetic constraint that they have to respond to the harsher weather conditions and lower resource availability. Newfoundland martens are forest-dependent species because they require overhead canopy for security and avoidance of predation, structurally complexity with abundant coarse woody debris and large diameter trees for winter resting sites, maternal dens, and access to small mammal prey in winter, as well as martens are more successful at catching prey in the older, structurally complex forest which is not necessarily where the prey are abundant. The older coniferous forest is not needed just for escape from predation, prey availability, and den sites but also for thermoregulation. Tree height is important to provide this thermally neutral area from resting sites as well as escape routes from predators. Canopy closer is a critical element of marten habitat, studies have shown that the presence of vertical stem structure and down woody debris is adequate to provide the security needed even if over head cover is absent; though marten still typically avoid the areas that are devoid of trees. Down logs and other woody debris are important to the marten habitat, not just for cover from predators, but also for access to prey and for suitable sites for resting and maternal dens. The determinant of suitable habitat may be forest structure over the species composition or age. The reduced number of larger mammalian predators on the island compared to mainland martens slightly reduces the necessity to have escape cover which releases the selective pressure for Newfoundland martens to expand their habitat into areas that have higher prey densities, but with less secure cover relative to the mainland populations of martens. Essentially the Newfoundland marten needs the jumble of dead and down timber that is provided by the old growth forests, where it allows for access under the snow during winter to small mammals providing the martens the resources needed to survive until spring; resources clearcuts cannot provide. Habitat structure required for a healthy marten population needs decades to develop and have individual home range requirements that are large for the small carnivore. Due to the changes in the stand-level dynamics and landscape-level phenomena shows that serious management is necessary to get the forests of Newfoundland to be prime habitat. However, the conflict between the valuable economic resource of the timber and the preservation of the Newfoundland Marten will continue, suggesting that the system of permanent habitat reserves may not be a stable management strategy. Diet Newfoundland has a small diversity of small mammal prey species, only topping out at 8. Out of these 8 only three small mammal prey species are found within the marten's forested range, including: meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), masked shrew (Sorex cinereus), and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). Historically, meadow voles were thought to comprise the diet of the Newfoundland marten because the meadow vole is the only endemic small mammal species that occurs in the forested habitat used by the martens. New studies have shown that the Newfoundland Marten's diet is more generalized, with their diet in the winter being primarily Snowshoe Hare. Hares occur at high densities in regenerating forests and meadow voles occur at low densities in the forests and therefore the movement patterns of the Newfoundland marten may be a response to the fluctuating hare abundance in the habitat. On the island, Meadow Voles occur in the coniferous forest as well as the open, grassy areas. The Newfoundland martens primary diet in the summer consists of the meadow voles, and switch to primary diet of snowshoe hares by an increase of 10-fold. A study showed that the Meadow Voles occurred at 80% of the diet during the summer, then dropping to 47.5% of the diet during the winter, where as Snowshoe Hare increased to 28% during the winter. The introduced Snowshoe Hare is a critical food source during winter, which is the energetically stressful period during the year. Other food types that are included in the marten's diet includes Masked Shrews, Red Squirrels, Moose and Caribou carrion, insects, birds, and berries, however, these food items only occur less than 10% of the overall diet. During the summer with the primary food source being Meadow Voles, the next common food types was berries. This study shows a highly diverse diet and a generalist foraging strategy for the use of available prey. Southern Red-backed Voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) may have been deliberately introduced to increase the small mammal prey population available for the Newfoundland Marten. This management option was debated during the Newfoundland Marten recovery plan because the Southern Red-backed voles are a common prey for the American marten's diet elsewhere. While the positive aspect is having a greater prey abundance to facilitate the Newfoundland Marten population increase, there are some negative aspects to the introduction of the Southern Red-backed Vole. The Southern Red-backed Vole competes with the Meadow Vole and therefore will have an effect by decreasing the distribution and densities of the Meadow Vole, which are an important prey species. The introduction of the Southern Red-backed Vole could also pull in the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations which compete with the Newfoundland Marten because of a major dietary overlap therefore increasing competition for food. Red Fox are also the most important natural predator of the Newfoundland Marten and with the increase in food competition will also lead to an increase in intraguild predation. Reproduction Newfoundland Martens reach sexual maturity at 15 months, breeding once a year. Behavioral interactions and patterns of scent-marking suggest that the female influences the male marking and activity. Marking often happens in the same locations and is thought to facilitate social interaction. The breeding season begins early July continuing until late July to August. During this time period there is an increase in scent-marking, intersexual body contact, and intrasexual female aggression. Martens scent-mark with anal and abdominal scent glands that they drag over the ground and trees, as well as by spraying. The scent-marking brings individuals together for mating, which includes mock wrestling. The female martens seem to control the timing and duration of mating, sometimes encourage the male on some occasions. The young are born in April in litter sizes of 1-5 inside dens sometimes underground, usually on steep slopes. Den sites have also included rock piles, squirrel middens, and tree cavities. The kits are born blind, deaf, and fur-less getting weaned at about 42 days. The dens are protected from April 1 to June 30. Fecundity is thought to be particularly low because of the reduced diversity and abundance of prey that historically occur on the island. Population The Newfoundland marten is genetically distinct from the American marten. Populations have declined drastically since the 1800s as a result of habitat loss from logging and overtrapping. The population census from 1986 was at 630-875 individuals decreased to 300 animals in 1995 creating the concern that inbreeding could become a problem in the population. The Newfoundland marten's population appears to be several small metapopulations that have limited interpopulation dispersal there is a large concern for the viability of the species. The recent population census in 2007 estimates that the individual numbers are between 286 and 556 adults that are spread across 5 subpopulations with mean densities ranging from 0.04 to 0.08 marten per km2. Status The Newfoundland marten is considered to be endangered and is protected in Canada under the Species at Risk Act (SARA), the Canada National Parks Act, and the Newfoundland and Labrador Endangered Species Act. The animal was first designated as Threatened in 1986, and was redesignated as Endangered in 1996 and 2000, with an estimated population of 300. COSEWIC re-evaluated the species in April 2007, and changed the designation to Threatened. =Threats= Clear-cut harvesting techniques that are practiced throughout the boreal forest impact the Newfoundland marten directly because of habitat loss and at the scale cutting is occurring it is the greatest impact. Habitat loss is not just from forest harvest, though it is the greatest, it also occurs from agricultural development, mining operations, expansion of development areas, and construction of roads and utility corridors. The Newfoundland marten depends on the forested area for denning and resting sites, foraging habitat as well as breeding habitat. The habitat that then follows is often a much lower quality habitat because it is second-growth forest. Within this lower quality forest, martens must spend more energy to defend a larger area in order to have the resources necessary, but still have increased risk of predation and lower foraging success in these stands. Clear- cut size is determined by the economic logistic constrains including road accessibility, topography and the areas of mature timber. Typically cutting will harvest all merchantable timber, near 1000 ha, leaving small stands as residuals. Adjacent areas are harvested during the next successive years, and adding in the new roads, the area of clear-cuts over time is very large. The areas of treeless land inhibits marten dispersal, which decreases genetic variation and dispersal in areas with barriers. Historically, overtrapping had been the cause of decline for the Newfoundland marten. During the mid-1800s it was documented many thousands of marten pelts were exported to the United Kingdom from communities on Newfoundland. Legal trapping season for the Newfoundland marten has been closed since 1934. However, accidental mortality of the Newfoundland marten in snares continues at a rate of 1.45 marten per year since 1970, which out of 300 individuals is too high as well as the possibility of unreported kill. Snares set for snowshoe hares cause 92% of juvenile mortality and 58% of adult mortality in the marten. Other threats for the Newfoundland Marten also include diseases that can be spread my farmed mink or other mustelids, as well as disease from domestic animals. There is also the unknown effect of the introduction of the Southern Red-backed Vole, including the potential impact of increasing predators including red fox, coyote, and raptors, all of which will kill marten and compete for food and den sites. =Recovery= In 1996, a captive breeding program was started at the Salmonier Nature Park, near St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, producing litters in 1999 and 2002; this program has since ceased. The attempts to breed martens in captivity have failed or produced inconsistent results to continue the program. In 1999, four captive-breed martens were released to the wild near Terra Nova National Park. The remaining habitat on Newfoundland was designated as \\"Pine Marten Study Area\\" (PMSA) due to the major decline by 1973 and within this area all trapping and snaring was prohibited because it was thought to be the major cause of mortality. Logging within the PMSA area continued until 1987, by which about half the forest portion was logged. Outside of the PMSA, population continued to decline leading the Committee on the status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) to list on April 1986 the Newfoundland marten as threatened. The Western Newfoundland Model Forest (WNMF) is not a land-holding agency but instead collaborates with provincial agencies, local governments, timber corporations and environmental groups to develop management plans for all resources within its administrative boundary which includes the PMSA area. A Recovery Plan was created by a recovery team to protect the Newfoundland marten by seven objectives including: 1) maintain and enhance existing populations and support the natural historical dispersal, 2) identify the distribution of critical and recovery habitat, 3) manage critical and recovery habitat for survival, 4) reduce incidental mortality by reducing incidental snaring and trapping, 5) continue understanding marten ecology for effective management, 6) continue population monitoring to assess recovery success, and 7) obtain stakeholder support and involvement. The National Recovery Plan aimed to establish 2 discrete populations on the island with a minimum size of 350 animals each with 100 satellite animals. In order to reduce incidental mortality by snaring and trapping and habitat loss by timber harvesting critical habitat for the Newfoundland marten was placed in groups for legal protection. Therefore, 100% of the critical habitat for the marten has at least partial form of legal protection. A total of 29% of critical habitat is fully protected where all forestry harvesting, traps and snares are legally prohibited. The remainder of the areas have partial protection from both harvesting and trapping and snaring, as well as using the approved snaring and trapping techniques. Snare mortality has also been reduced by a modified snare mechanism that was developed. The modified snare is designed to exploit the behavioral differences between the hare and marten where hare tend to pull against a snare but martens tend to twist. The modified snares in a controlled setting successfully retained 100% of hares and released 100% of martens tested. However, this modified snare still if improperly set will reduce the effectiveness at releasing trapped marten, therefore education and training programs have begun to improve correct setting and increase participation in snare regulations.

Lithium is generally present in brown dwarfs and not in low-mass stars. Stars, which by definition must achieve the high temperature (2.5 √ó 106 K) necessary for fusing hydrogen, rapidly deplete their lithium. 7Li Burning of the most abundant isotope of lithium, lithium-7, occurs by a collision of 7Li and a proton producing two helium-4 nuclei. The temperature necessary for this reaction is just below the temperature necessary for hydrogen fusion. Convection in low-mass stars ensures that lithium in the whole volume of the star is depleted. Therefore, the presence of the lithium line in a candidate brown dwarf's spectrum is a strong indicator that it is indeed substellar. 6Li From a study of lithium abundances in 53 T Tauri stars, it has been found that lithium depletion varies strongly with size, suggesting that lithium burning by the P-P chain, during the last highly convective and unstable stages during the pre‚Äìmain sequence later phase of the Hayashi contraction may be one of the main sources of energy for T Tauri stars. Rapid rotation tends to improve mixing and increase the transport of lithium into deeper layers where it is destroyed. T Tauri stars generally increase their rotation rates as they age, through contraction and spin-up, as they conserve angular momentum. This causes an increased rate of lithium loss with age. Lithium burning will also increase with higher temperatures and mass, and will last for at most a little over 100 million years. The P-P chain for lithium burning is as follows :{ border=\\"0\\" - style=\\"height:2em;\\" + ‚Üí (unstable) - style=\\"height:2em;\\" + ‚Üí + - style=\\"height:2em;\\" + ‚Üí (unstable) - style=\\"height:2em;\\" ‚Üí 2 + energy } It will not occur in stars less than sixty times the mass of Jupiter. In this way, the rate of lithium depletion can be used to calculate the age of the star. Lithium test The use of lithium to distinguish candidate brown dwarfs from low-mass stars is commonly referred to as the lithium test. Heavier stars like our Sun can retain lithium in their outer atmospheres, which never get hot enough for lithium depletion, but those are distinguishable from brown dwarfs by their size. Brown dwarfs at the high end of their mass range (60‚Äì75 MJ) can be hot enough to deplete their lithium when they are young. Dwarfs of mass greater than 65 MJ can burn off their lithium by the time they are half a billion years old; thus, this test is not perfect.

The name of the island alludes to the folklore inhabitants, the Naga people. It is home to the Hindu shrine of Nagapooshani Amman Temple; one of the prominent 64 Shakti Peethas, and the Buddhist shrine Nagadeepa Purana Viharaya. Historians note the island is mentioned in the ancient Tamil Sangam literature of nearby Tamil Nadu such as Manimekalai where it was mentioned as Manipallavam (, and ancient Buddhist legends of Sri Lanka such as Mahavamsa. Ptolemy, a Greek cartographer, describes the Tamil territory including islands around the Jaffna peninsula as Nagadibois in the first century CE. History NƒÅka Tivu / NƒÅka Nadu was the name of the whole Jaffna peninsula in some historical documents. There are number of Buddhist myths associated with the interactions of people of this historical place with Buddha. The two Tamil Jain and Buddhist epics of the second century - Kundalakesi and Manimekalai - describe the islet of Manipallavam of NƒÅka Nadu, this islet of the Jaffna peninsula, from where merchants came to obtain gems and conch shells. The protagonists of the former story by Nathakuthanaar, visited the island. In the latter poem by Sƒ´thalai SƒÅttanƒÅr, the sea goddess Manimekhala brings the heroine to the island, where she worships Lord Buddha. She is also told of the petrosomatoglyph atop the mountain of the main island and a magic bowl Amudha Surabhi (cornucopia bowl) that appears once every year in a lake of the islet. The Manimekhalai and the Mahavamsa both describe Buddha settling a dispute between two Naga princes over a gem set throne seat on an island known as Manipallavam or Nagadeepa, identified as Nainativu by several scholars. The Tamil language inscription of the Nainativu Hindu temple by Par√¢kramab√¢hu I of the 12th century CE states that foreigners landing at new ports must meet at Kayts and they must be protected, and if ships to the islet carrying elephants and horses get shipwrecked, a fourth of the cargo must go to the treasury.K. Indrapala. (1963). The Nainativu Tamil Inscription of Parakramabahu I. UCR Vol XX1. No. 1. pp.70 The epic Manimekalai tells the story of the Chola king Killi who on a visit to the island fell in love with the naga princess Pilivalai, the daughter of king Valaivanan of Manipallavam. The prince born out of this union was Tondaiman Ilamtiraiyan. When the boy grew up the princess wanted to send her son to the Chola kingdom. So she entrusted the prince to a merchant who dealt in woolen blankets called Kambala Chetty when the latter's ship stopped in the island. During the voyage to the Chola kingdom, the ship was wrecked due to rough weather and the boy was lost. He was later found washed ashore with a Tondai twig (creeper) around his leg. So he came to be called Tondaiman Ilam Tiraiyan meaning the young one of the seas or waves. When he grew up the northern part of the Chola kingdom was entrusted to him and the area he governed came to be called Tondaimandalam after him. He is considered by some scholars to be the progenitor of the Pallava dynasty and the dynasty he founded took its name after the native place of his mother, that is Manipallavam.. Naga People Naga people were snake-worshippers, a Dravidian custom, and spoke Tamil based on Ptolemy's description of the Naga people.Laura Smid (2003). South Asian folklore: an encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka. Great Britain: Routledge. 429.Chelvadurai Manogaran (1987). Ethnic conflict and reconciliation in Sri Lanka . United States of America: University of Hawaii Press. 21. They also likely spoke Prakrit, a language of the school of Amaravathi village, Guntur district with which the early Tamils of Jaffna had strong cultural relations during the classical period. The NƒÅkas were a branch of the Dravidian community, and were at that time part of the Chera kingdom, and of ancient Tamilakam. Archaeological excavations and studies provide evidence of palaeolithic inhabitation in the Tamil dominated Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka and in Tamil Naadu and Chera Naadu (Kerala region). The findings include NƒÅka idols and suggest that serpent worship was widely practised in the Dravidian regions of India and Sri Lanka during the megalithic period.http://keraladotpark.com/pdf/Archacological%20wonders.pdf A research paper from archaeologist Dr. P. Rajendran showing evidence of paleolithic age human inhabitation in Kerala. This includes the pictures of serpent idols made of clay and metal which belong to the mesolithic age.Department of Archaeology, Kerala University confirms paleolithic age findings in KeralaGeneral article for palaeolithic age findings in ancient Chera regionA very detailed article including palaeolithic age in Kerala which was then part of Chera Naadu, one of the three Tamil kingdoms of that era The NƒÅkas lived among the Yakkha, Raksha and Deva in Ceylon according to the Manimekalai and Mahavamsa. Cobra worship, Tamil speech and Keralan cuisine extant in Jaffna Tamil culture from the classical period attests to the NƒÅka's heritage. Sangam literature details how the ancient Tamil people were divided into five clans (Kudi) based on their profession during the Sangam period, where the NƒÅka clan, who were in charge of border security guarding the city wall and distant fortresses, inhabited the Coromandel Coast - South Tamil Nadu, East Tamil Nadu and North Sri Lanka. The name NƒÅka was either a corrupted version of the word Nayinaar or may have been applied to this community due to their head covering being the shape of a hydra-headed cobra in reverence to their serpentine deities. British historian and author of \\"Ancient Ceylon\\" considers the NƒÅka to be an offshoot of the Nayars of KeralaH. Parker (1909). Ancient Ceylon. New Dehli: Asian Educational Services. 7. Ancient Tamil epic Manimekalai and the Sri Lankan history book Mahavamsa both mention a dispute between two Naga kings in northern Sri Lanka.http://www.lankalibrary.com/heritage/naga.htm Some scholars derives the origin of the Pallava dynasty of Tamilakam from an marriage alliance of the Cholas and the Naga from Jaffna Peninsula. This incident is mentioned in the Tamil epic, Manimekalai. =Decline of Naga identity and assimilation = According to scholars did the Naga people, also known as Nayanair, assimilate to Tamil language and culture, forming one of descendants of the Sri Lankan Tamils. They continue to worship their patron Nayinaar deity (a five headed cobra) and Nagapooshani Amman even today within the sanctum sanctorum of the Nainativu Nagapooshani Amman Temple. Demography The population of the island is approximately 2,500 Sri Lankan Tamils and about 150 Muslims. Many Tamils of Nainativu origin, live in various cities and towns of India, Europe, Australia, and North America as part of the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora.

Sarkies grew up in the South Island city of Dunedin. He attended Kaikorai Valley College. His three feature films to date have been set in Dunedin, or in the lower South Island. After his debut feature Scarfies, Sarkies followed it in 2006 with Out of the Blue, based on the 1990 Aramoana Massacre, then black comedy Two Little Boys, starring Bret McKenzie and Australia's Hamish Blake. Short films Sarkies began making short films as a teenager with fellow filmmaker Simon Perkins and Lindsay Chalmers. After winning an international award for his short Dream-makers, Sarkies began work on his most ambitious short to date: adventure comedy Signing Off (1996), which won four international awards and helped attract funding for Scarfies (1999), his feature debut. Feature films Sarkies co-wrote the Scarfies script with his younger brother, playwright and performer Duncan Sarkies. Winner of seven awards including Best Picture and Best Director at the NZ Film Awards, and a local hit, the film is part comedy, part thriller, and partly a celebration of being a university student in Dunedin. Scarfies was later released on video in the United States under the title Crime 101. Sarkies' second feature was drama Out of the Blue based on the 1990 Aramoana Massacre, in which a gunman killed thirteen people in a seaside town close to Dunedin. The film emphasizes realism over melodrama, partly through handheld camerawork and a naturalistic acting style. Some of those living in Aramoana expressed opposition to the film being made; others who lost people in the tragedy agreed to do interviews with scriptwriters Sarkies and Graeme Tetley.Out of the Blue Presskit NZ Film Commission website Accessed February 6, 2008 In New Zealand, Out of the Blue became the tenth most successful local film yet released theatrically (not accounting for inflation). It also won six Qantas Film and Television Awards in September 2008, including \\"Best Picture - budget over $1 million\\". As of October 2008, Out of the Blue's rating on critics' website Rotten Tomatoes was 91 per cent.Rotten Tomatoes review Accessed October 10, 2008 Sarkies' third feature was 2012 black comedy Two Little Boys, starring Bret McKenzie and Australian television personality Hamish Blake. The film is based on a book by Duncan Sarkies, about two sometime friends trying to hide the body of a tourist one of them has accidentally killed. Before making Out of the Blue, the Sarkies brothers collaborated on the script for a proposed fantasy film called The Magnificent Magic Fingers. The budget for Magic Fingers was estimated to be at least NZ$20 million. It is unknown whether Magic Fingers is still in development or not. Television In 2010, dystopian TV series This Is Not My Life debuted on New Zealand Television. The series centres around a man (played by Charles Mesure) who wakes up with no knowledge of the woman he appears to be married to, his children or job. Directed by Sarkies and Peter Salmon, it won a 2011 New Zealand television award for best drama series.

Ochraceae is a valid botanic name for a taxonomic series within the plant genus Banksia. It was published by Kevin Thiele in 1996, but discarded by Alex George in 1999. Cladistics The name came about after a cladistic analysis of Banksia by Thiele and Pauline Ladiges yielded a phylogeny somewhat at odds with the arrangement of Alex George. They found George's B. ser. Cyrtostylis to be \\"widely polyphyletic\\", with six of its fourteen taxa occurring singly in locations throughout the cladogram; these were transferred to other series or left incertae sedis. The remaining eight taxa formed a clade, which further resolved into two subclades: Taxonomy Thiele and Ladiges preferred to give series rank to the subclades, rather than the entire clade, so they transferred the taxa of the second clade into a new series, retaining only the taxa of the first clade in B. ser. Cyrtostylis. The new series was given the name B. ser. Ochraceae, from the Latin ochraceae (\\"ochre-coloured\\"), in reference to the colour of the inflorescences of most species in that series. It was formally defined as containing those species with \\"linear-terete pollen-presenters that are scarcely distinct from the style, very small, narrowly flabellate-tridentate early seedling leaves, and often browning-orange inflorescences\\". B. benthamiana (Bentham's Banksia) was designated the type species. The placement and circumscription of B. ser. Ochraceae in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement of Banksia may be summarised as follows: B. laevigata subsp. laevigata B. laevigata subsp. fuscolutea :Banksia ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) ::B. elegans (incertae sedis) ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. ser. Tetragonae (4 species) :::B. ser. Lindleyanae (1 species) :::B. ser. Banksia (2 subseries, 12 species) :::B. baueri (incertae sedis) :::B. lullfitzii (incertae sedis) :::B. attenuata (incertae sedis) :::B. ashbyi (incertae sedis) :::B. coccinea (incertae sedis) :::B. ser. Prostratae (8 species) :::B. ser. Cyrtostylis (4 species) :::B. ser. Ochraceae ::::B. benthamiana ::::B. audax ::::B. laevigata :::::B. laevigata subsp. laevigata :::::B. laevigata subsp. fuscolutea :::B. ser. Grandes (2 species) :::B. ser. Salicinae (2 series, 11 species, 4 subspecies) :::B. ser. Spicigerae (3 series, 7 species, 6 varieties) :::B. ser. Quercinae (2 species) :::B. ser. Dryandroideae (1 species) :::B. ser. Abietinae (4 subseries, 15 species, 8 varieties) Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement remained current only until 1999, when it was overturned by George. Recent developments Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements. With respect to B. ser. Ochraceae, Mast's results differ somewhat from the arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges. B. benthamiana and B. audax appear to be closely related, but B. laevigata forms only one of three polytomous sister clades to it, and the clade corresponding to Thiele and Ladiges' B. ser. Cyrtostylis is not particularly close. Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by transferring Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. All members of B. ser. Ochraceae fall within Mast and Thiele's B. subg. Banksia, but nothing further has been published. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete. References ser.

The First Nation have reserved for themselves the 67 ha Chapleau 61A Indian Reserve, 64.7 ha Chapleau 74 Indian Reserve and the 799.3 ha Chapleau 74A Indian Reserve. In September, 2007, their total registered population 39, of which their on-reserve population was 30 (24 on their main Reserve). History The people of Chapleau Ojibwe First Nation live on the only Ojibwa-language reserve in the Chapleau area. Their historical kinship and relationship with the land therefore draws them west to the shores of Lake Superior and south to the shores of Lake Huron, rather than north into Cree territory to the shores of James Bay. As such, much of their traditional territory was ceded to the Crown under the 1850 Robinson Treaties. These treaties cover all land whose waters drain into the north shores of lakes Huron and Superior. Chapleau Ojibwe forefathers were not, however, signatories to the Robinson Treaties, partly because William Benjamin Robinson did not take the time to meet with inland First Nation communities and partly because inland First Nation leaders were reluctant to travel as a result of a cholera outbreak in 1849. After visiting Chapleau in 1905, the Treaty No. 9 commissioners reported that it would not be necessary to negotiate a treaty with the Indian people of Chapleau as they belonged to bands residing at Moose Factory, English River and other places already under treaty. Treaty No. 9 covers all land in the Chapleau are that drains north into James Bay. Since large reserves had already been established in other parts of the province for the bands from which people at Chapleau had immigrated, the commissioners recommended that a small area be set aside for Chapleau Ojibwe so that they could build small houses and cultivate garden plots. The Chapleau Ojibway Reserve was established in 1950. Governance The First Nation is led by Chief Anita Stephens and two Councillors: Johanne Wesley and Joshua Memegos. Chapleau Ojibway First Nation is member of Wabun Tribal Council, a regional tribal council affiliated with the Nishnawbe Aski Nation. Chapleau Ojibway First Nation is policed by the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service, an Aboriginal-based service.

They are mostly known for their time in WWE, where they performed as The Ascension using the names Konnor and Viktor, respectively. The Ascension was formerly a stable from 2011 to 2012. The Ascension originally started out in Florida Championship Wrestling as a stable consisting of Conor O'Brian, Kenneth Cameron, Ricardo Rodriguez, Tito Colon and Raquel Diaz. After several membership changes, Conor O'Brian and Rick Victor (their respective ring names were also shortened to Konnor and Viktor), then became established as a tag- team in NXT. Their 364-day NXT Tag Team Championship reign is currently the longest in the history of the title. In 2019, the duo were released from WWE after months of inactivity.  History  = First incarnation (2011‚Äì2012) = At Florida Championship Wrestling's August 28, 2011 event, Ricardo Rodriguez announced the formation of a stable called The Ascension, with members including Kenneth Cameron, Conor O'Brian, Tito Colon, and Raquel Diaz. The first match to include all members in some capacity came on September 1, 2011, and saw Cameron, Colon and O‚ÄôBrian, accompanied by Diaz, defeating CJ Parker, Donny Marlow, and Johnny Curtis. On September 30, Cameron and Colon had a shot at the Florida Tag Team Championship but lost to then champions CJ Parker and Donny Marlow. In October, The Ascension was no longer associated with Rodriguez, as video packages promoting The Ascension with new darker characters only featured the other four Ascension members without Rodriguez. By the end of November, The Ascension had all but disbanded, as O'Brian fell to injury and Colon was called up to WWE main roster to team with his cousin Primo, meanwhile Diaz became Queen of FCW and distanced herself from the stable. This left Cameron as the sole survivor of The Ascension and he continued to use The Ascension gimmick during his appearances. However the disintegration of the group would prove to be beneficial for Cameron as he would go on a three-month singles winning streak, beating the likes of Jiro and Calvin Raines until he finally lost to Colin Cassady on February 23, 2012. On March 15, 2012 Cameron was accompanied to the ring by the returning Conor O'Brian in his match against Byron Saxton, the match ended in disqualification when O'Brian interfered. Cameron and O'Brian began wrestling as a tag team using the name of The Ascension, with their first tag team match together coming on March 23 when the two defeated Jason Jordan and Xavier Woods. The Ascension suffered their first loss when the pair lost to the Florida Tag Team Champions Corey Graves and Jake Carter in a title bout. After this loss, the Ascension would go on another winning streak including winning a fatal four- way elimination against the teams of Adam Mercer and Chad Baxter, Jason Jordan and Mike Dalton, and Brad Maddox and Rick Victor. On June 20, 2012, The Ascension made their debut on NXT, defeating CJ Parker and Mike Dalton with their double team finisher, Downcast. They would later enter a rivalry with The Usos, with the Ascension getting the better end of most of the encounters between the two teams. The Ascension also defeated another main roster team in Justin Gabriel and Tyson Kidd on the October 3, 2012 episode of NXT. However, the team was disbanded after Cameron was released from his WWE contract on November 30, 2012 after being arrested. = NXT Tag Team division dominance (2013‚Äì2014) = From there O'Brian worked as a singles wrestler, keeping the Ascension gimmick on his own for some time. Following O'Brian's victory over Alex Riley on the June 5, 2013 edition of NXT, Rick Victor appeared on the ramp, getting O'Brian's attention. Victor would officially accompany O'Brian to the ring as his partner in the Ascension on the July 3 edition of NXT as O'Brian defeated Andy Baker. After winning a gauntlet match to determine the number one contenders for the NXT Tag Team Championship, the Ascension defeated the team of Adrian Neville and Corey Graves on the October 2 edition of NXT to capture the titles. On November 8 the two were renamed, Conor O'Brian renamed to Konnor and Rick Victor renamed to Viktor. For the majority of their title reign, The Ascension would battle and dismantle local wrestlers in mere minutes with very little to no offense from their opponents. Their first major title defense was against Too Cool (Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty) at NXT's first live special, NXT Arrival, where they emerged victorious. The Ascension began demanding competition in the weeks following, moving up from local wrestlers to various combinations of teams made up from contracted NXT wrestlers. While still disabling and annihilating their opponents week after week, they were confronted by a team of masked wrestlers; El Local and Kalisto, who challenged them for their tag team titles at the second live event, NXT TakeOver. Though they were given their toughest challenge to date, The Ascension successfully defended their gold after hitting Fall of Man on Local. The Ascension had a cameo on the main roster on the September 9, 2014 episode of Main Event to promote their upcoming title defense, defeating Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando) in a match to promote their title defense against The Lucha Dragons (Kalisto and Sin Cara) at the NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way event. At the event, The Ascension lost the titles to Kalisto and Sin Cara, ending their reign a day short of a full year at 364 days. That same night, they were in an altercation with William Regal and the debuting Hideo Itami. After feuding with and assaulting Itami for several weeks, a second international wrestler, Finn B√°lor, joined Itami in his fight against both Konnor and Viktor. This led to a match on December 11 at NXT TakeOver: R Evolution, where The Ascension were defeated by B√°lor and Itami. = Beginnings on the main roster (2014‚Äì2016) = In the main roster, The Ascension changed their look, similar to The Road Warriors. The following night on SmackDown, vignettes began to air promoting The Ascension's call-up to the main roster. They were promoted to the main roster on the December 29, 2014 episode of Raw, defeating The Miz and Damien Mizdow. On the January 2 and 9 episodes of SmackDown and the January 5 episode of Raw, The Ascension easily defeated local preliminary wrestlers in less than a minute, and also cementing their heel status after comparing themselves to prominent tag teams of the past including The Powers of Pain, The Road Warriors and Demolition. By the second week of their main roster run, Mike Tedesco of wrestleview.com lambasted how WWE had made the Ascension lose all credibility for two reasons: firstly, they openly admitted being \\"a rip off of The Road Warriors and Demolition\\", and secondly, all the commentators (including JBL, who was a heel commentator) disparaged the Ascension as \\"nothing compared\\" to the older teams they were copying. On the January 19 episode of Raw, the Ascension confronted the reuniting New World Order members Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and X-Pac. However, the Ascension were then interrupted, attacked by and laid out by two other past-generation teams: the Acolytes Protection Agency and the New Age Outlaws. At this point, various critics were labeling the writing for the Ascension's main roster storylines to be that \\"it seemed WWE gave up on [the Ascension] in week two of their main roster run\\", with WWE making \\"a mockery of the push every single week\\" with \\"criminal booking\\". The storyline culminated in the Ascension defeating the New Age Outlaws at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view. On the February 12, 2015 episode of SmackDown, the Ascension's main roster winning streak (since their call up) ended in a tag team turmoil (gauntlet) match; they entered against Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns and were eliminated via disqualification. On the February 23 episode of Raw, the Ascension suffered their first pinfall loss on the main roster, courtesy of the Prime Time Players. Although they defeated The Prime Time Players in a rematch on the next week's episode of Superstars, the Ascension's fortunes then vastly declined; between early March to the end of July 2015, they appeared regularly on Main Event and Superstars, and started a losing streak. At WrestleMania 31, Konnor and Viktor made their WrestleMania debuts in the Andr√© the Giant memorial battle royal, with neither of the duo winning the match. In May, The Ascension started a feud against The Meta Powers and defeated them at Payback pre-show. At Elimination Chamber on May 31, they participated in an Elimination Chamber match for the tag titles, they eliminated Los Matadores and the Lucha Dragons until they were eliminated by The Prime Time Players. On the September 3 episode of SmackDown, The Ascension attacked Neville as he was making his way to the ring against Stardust, aligning themselves with Stardust in the process and thus forming a group known as \\"The Cosmic Wasteland\\", where in Stardust calls The Ascension his \\"henchmen\\". At Night of Champions, Stardust and The Ascension defeated Neville and The Lucha Dragons in a six-man tag team match in the pre-show, but were subsequently defeated in two rematches. On the Survivor Series kickoff, The Cosmic Wasteland, The Miz, and Bo Dallas were defeated by The Dudley Boyz, Neville, Goldust and Titus O'Neil in a Five-on-five traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match. In May 2016, The Cosmic Wasteland stable disbanded after Stardust left the company. At WrestleMania 32, Konnor and Viktor entered the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal, both with failing efforts. On April 16, 2016, WWE suspended Konnor for 60 days for a second violation of the Talent Wellness policy. Following the suspension, Viktor began competing in singles competition, mainly on Superstars and Main Event. Konnor made his return during the June 20 WWE Superstars taping, teaming with Viktor to face The Golden Truth (Goldust and R-Truth). = Brand switches and departure (2016‚Äì2019) = On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, The Ascension were drafted to SmackDown brand in the eighth round. On July 26 episode of SmackDown Live, both members competed in a WWE World Championship #1 contendership six-pack qualifying battle royal, which was won by Apollo Crews. At SummerSlam, The Ascension competed in a 12-man tag team match, where their team lost. They then entered the SmackDown Tag Team Championship tournament where they were eliminated in the first round by The Usos. On the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pre-show, The Ascension, The Vaudevillains and Curt Hawkins lost a ten-man tag team match against Apollo Crews, American Alpha and The Hype Bros. At the 2017 Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, they fought in a tag team turmoil match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, but were the last team to be eliminated, losing to the reigning champions American Alpha. At WrestleMania 33, they once again entered the Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, but neither were successful. At Money in the Bank, The Ascension lost to Breezango (Tyler Breeze and Fandango) after they claimed responsibility for a vandal attack in their office. On the June 27 episode of SmackDown Live, The Ascension was interrogated by Breezango on \\"Fashion Vice\\", admitting that they didn't commit the crime and only took responsibility, because they wanted a match at the PPV. In September, the duo turned face when they started trying to befriend Breezango during the latters' 'Fashion Files' segments. On the January 9, 2018 episode of SmackDown Live, The Ascension suffered a loss to The Bludgeon Brothers, for a while the duo would only appear as supporting characters in Breezango's Fashion Files skits. At Wrestlemania 34, the duo were participants in the 5th annual Andr√© the Giant memorial battle royal, with Konnor being the first of the duo to be eliminated followed minutes later by Viktor. On April 16, The Ascension were traded to Raw brand as part of Superstar Shake-up. On the April 23 episode of Raw, The Ascension, once again as heels, faced the team of Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt in a losing effort. The two were participants in the Greatest Royal Rumble match, with Viktor being eliminated by Daniel Bryan, and Konnor being eliminated by Elias and The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods). On the April 12, 2019 episode of Main Event, The Ascension lost to Heavy Machinery (Otis and Tucker), in what would be their final match in WWE. On December 8, 2019, after eight months of inactivity, The Ascension were released from their WWE contracts. = Independent circuit (2020-present) = Following their departure from WWE, Konnor (under the ring name Big Kon)https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2020/03/konnor-talks-the-ascension-next- move-following-wwe-release-667831/ and Viktor (under the ring name of Vik) were announced for Wrestling Revolver's Pancakes and Piledrivers event during WrestleMania 36 weekend. On February 20, 2020, The Ascension competed in their first match since leaving WWE at Outlaw Wrestling defeating Bull James and Bill Carr. In June 2020, Big Kon and Vik revealed their new tag team name to be The Awakening.  Other media  The Ascension, consisting of the duo of Konnor and Viktor, made their video game debut as a part of the NXT Arrival DLC pack (Downloadable Content) in WWE 2K15. They are also part of WWE 2K16, WWE 2K17, WWE 2K18 and WWE 2K19 also as a duo.

Mormon folklore includes tales, oral history, popular beliefs, customs, music, jokes, and material culture traditions. In folklore studies, Mormons can be seen as a regional group, since the core group of Mormon settlers in Utah had a common religion and had to modify their surroundings for survival. This historical regional area includes Utah, Southeastern Idaho, parts of Wyoming and eastern Nevada, and a few towns in eastern Arizona, southern Alberta, northwestern New Mexico, southern Colorado, and northern Chihuahua, Mexico. Verbal lore for Mormons includes stories that missionaries tell each other as a part of initiation and also to encourage adherence to mission rules. Members tell stories about Mormon pioneers, The Three Nephites, and unseen benevolent spirits to bolster their faith. In pioneer times, folk songs alternately praised and punished prominent leaders like Brigham Young. Common customs for Mormons include reciting conversion narratives, which is especially common during fast and testimony meeting. Married members also commonly tell how they were inspired to choose their spouse, and some women with children recount that a vision of a future child inspired them to have more children. In the Mormon regional area, creative date invitations are a common way for teenagers to ask each other out. Pioneer Day is a state holiday in Utah, where members patriotically celebrate their religious predecessors. Pioneer handicrafts were inspired by the many cultures that came together in Utah. Handicrafts were initially a necessity, and pioneers developed techniques to adapt their skills to the materials on hand. Later, the Relief Society promoted handicrafts as improving mental health. Along with quilting and needlework, pioneers also made Hair jewellery, human hair wreaths, and silk thread. Towns in the Mormon regional area have a unique combination of features, including unpainted barns, irrigation ditches, wooden moveable hay derricks, and Lombardy poplars as wind breaks. Tombstones in this area commonly depict clasped hands or a Mormon temple. Mormon fundamentalists have different folklore from Latter-day Saints. They draw on their shared heritage of experience in government raids to unify them, and enjoy folk dancing.  Research into Mormon folklore  Alta S. and Austin E. Fife are the founders of research into Mormon folklore, a discipline that has expanded greatly since the couple‚Äôs initial work in the 1930s. Although previous and contemporary scholars had briefly addressed the issue, the Fifes expanded the field, both through their collection, now known as the Fife Folklore Archive, held at the Merrill-Cazier Library on the Utah State University campus in Logan, Utah. Their book on Mormon folklore, Saints of Sage and Saddle, was published in 1956. This book, according to folklorist Jill Terry Rudy, \\"remains the most complete book-length treatment of Mormon folklore\\". Folklorist William A. Wilson also specialized in Mormon folklore, and helped establish the way Mormon folklore is organized in archives.  Verbal lore  = Missionary lore = Missionaries have their own set of folklore. According to folklorist William A. Wilson, missionaries tell stories for four main purposes: to build a sense of comradeship, to cope with the pressures of missionary life, to encourage missionaries to keep mission rules, and to assure themselves of future victory. They commonly tell stories about how new missionaries, or \\"greenies\\", are initiated into the existing missionary group through pranks, even if these pranks never occurred. Learning missionary slang also helps new missionaries feel like part of the missionary community. Missionaries often tell stories in which some missionaries try to escape mission life but are discovered. One common \\"unauthorized trip story\\" tells how two missionaries write their weekly reports in advance, entrust them to their landlady, and embark on a sightseeing tour, only to be caught when their landlady sends the reports all at once. Another common story tells of a missionary who decides to break mission rules and participate in a sports tournament, only to be discovered by their mission president when their picture appears in the news. These stories focus on trickster heroes who fail and embody the group's childish fantasies, acting as \\"an approved steam-valve for the group\\". In some stories that encourage obedience, a missionary disobeys the rules and suffers disastrous consequences. Other stories tell of missionaries miraculously saved from danger. Missionaries also tell stories about getting the best of a hostile world, even if it causes other people to suffer. Missionaries in such stories shake the dust from their feet after leaving a city that was unresponsive to their message. After performing this ritual, the city is destroyed through a natural disaster, war, or economic depression. Stories where people insult missionaries, only to come to an untimely end, are common. = Folk narratives = Mormons tell stories about early church members, The Three Nephites, and spirits of dead people. Mormons often retell stories about how early members of the church endured persecution and hardships in order to inspire other members. Stories about plural wives often tell of the women's plight in having to share a husband, or the opposite, the convenient companionship of her sister wives. J. Golden Kimball was a member of the Seventy and a folk hero known for swearing and undermining authority; stories told about him are often humorous. Stories about Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, Eliza Snow, and other founders have a near-mythic status. The Three Nephites are three Nephite disciples chosen by Jesus in the Book of Mormon to never die. In modern Three Nephites stories, one or more of these men appear to give assistance to those in need and then mysteriously disappear. The assistance ranges from providing childcare to fixing a car. According to William Wilson, Three Nephites stories \\"reflect and reinforce church programs and, by endowing them with mystical values, place them beyond criticism or questioning.\\" Many Mormons engage in genealogy research in order to perform baptisms for the dead. One common folk narrative is for a researcher to have lost hope of finding more information, only to miraculously find it in a book or cemetery. There are also many stories of spirits helping church members to perform their temple work for the dead or conveying their gratitude somehow. = Folk songs = In the 1850s and 1860s, Mormons used secular songs for worship and entertainment. They wrote their own poetry and set it to the familiar, secular tunes. One popular tune was \\"The Sea.\\" Early church leader W. W. Phelps composed lyrics to the tune, as did fellow pioneer Joseph Cain. Some songs satirized other religions, as in \\"The God that others worship\\" set to the tune \\"The rose that all are praising.\\" Mormons also penned songs about persecution and Joseph and Hyrum's death. Many songs about Brigham Young circulated, depicting Young as either a tyrannical leader with a troubled home life or a righteous leader whose guidance led the Mormons into prosperity. In the case of \\"Brigham, Brigham Young,\\" the song was accepted when performed by a Mormon for other Mormons, but incited a riot when performed for mixed company. L.M. Hilton's version of \\"Hard Times\\" emphasized optimism in the face of persecution; Hilton said that it was one of Brigham Young's favorite songs and that he would sing it to Mormons to cheer them up.  Descriptions of customs  = Testimonies = Relating conversion narratives is one of the many ways Mormons express their faith. During monthly fast and testimony meeting held on fast Sunday, some members voluntarily share their dedication to their faith in a ritualized way, including informal ritualized expressions. Some of these informal ritualized expressions are so frequent that members joke about playing \\"testimony bingo\\" when they hear commonly used phrases like \\"I know beyond a shadow of a doubt\\" or \\"I know the church is true.\\" Conversion narratives are commonly related by LDS members in a way that mirrors the conversion of Joseph Smith: as a search for knowledge leading to receiving the \\"gift of true religious knowledge\\" and conversion to the gospel. Folklore student Amy Ward studied the conversion narratives of lifelong members and adult converts to the LDS church. She found that adult converts were more likely to describe their conversion was part of a long, unconscious search for religious truth. Folklore scholar Eric Eliason notes that Mormons tend to prefer sincere, even humorous, conversion narratives over melodramatic or self-serving ones. \\"Latter-day Saints often evaluate conversion narratives and testimonies based on an antiperformance aesthetic. Stories that seem contrived, melodramatic, self-centered, or manipulative can be deemed in violation of the principles of this genre's raisons d'√™tre.\\" Marriage confirmation narratives, told in communal cooperation settings, relate how people let God or a church leader decide whom they should marry. This helped them to overcome their anxiety about whom to choose to marry. The folk belief that there exists only one suitable marriage partner, perpetuated in Mormon media but not supported by Mormon theology, exacerbates this anxiety. Generally, marriage confirmation narratives support the idea that righteous living within Mormon expectations will lead to blessings like receiving spiritual revelation about who should become one's marriage partner and having a happy marriage. Such narratives help reinforce Mormon ideas about Mormons being a chosen community who receive special spiritual experiences, and help establish and fortify socially desirable behavior. Some Mormon women experience a vision of a future child that inspired them to have more children. If the next child is different from the child in the vision, the woman knows that the child is still \\"coming\\" and has another child. Margaret K. Brady documented this narrative type and sees it as a way to relieve Mormon women from the guilt they feel about thinking not to have more children, because the vision encourages them to change their mind and have more children. Sometimes these women share this experience in a visionary narrative. Telling the story reinforces the woman's spiritual identity, thus giving her a measure of power in her religious community. = Courtship and families = Creative date invitations are pervasive in the Idaho, Utah, and Arizona area, starting in the 1970s when young women were encouraged to ask young men to Sadie Hawkins dances. Folklorist Kristi Young writes that creative date invitations allowed young women to feel more comfortable asking young men on dates, since creative date invitations often do not require face- to-face interaction. Sometimes the recipient of a creative date invitation will accept even if they already have a significant other. The LDS Church encourages families to meet together in \\"family home evening\\" on Monday nights. Assignments for prayer, song, lesson, game, and treat are often rotated between family members on homemade charts. Certain rituals are performed during life events. After a baby is born, it is given a blessing, usually by their father with other male relatives and friends joining the blessing circle. Children are usually baptized at age eight, and receive a patriarchal blessing sometime in their teens. Young men and women may volunteer to be a missionary. In LDS funerals, the deceased wears their ceremonial temple clothing to be buried. = Pioneer Day = The first Pioneer Day was celebrated in 1849, with Mormons in Salt Lake City marching in wards, or congregational groups, around Temple Square in a show of patriotism. Many other towns in Utah had their own celebrations. Steven Olson notes that Pioneer Day celebrations reenact an idealized culture, providing a window into Mormon culture. Celebrations in the latter half of the 19th century emphasized how Mormons were a free, blessed, and chosen people. Floats and decorations celebrated agricultural bounties that Mormons saw as God blessing their settlement. Mormon leaders were escorted from their homes to the celebrations, where they participated as speakers. Parades separated participants by age and gender and celebrated traditional gender roles. Dances and sports competitions were common. In Utah where Pioneer Day is an official holiday, the day is celebrated with fireworks and historical reenactments. However, outside of Utah, observance depends on local members; often a congregation will have pioneer-themed talks but no festivities. Dutch Mormons tend not to celebrate it, but in Germany, Pioneer Day is popular among Mormons. = Other customs = In the mid-20th century, several performance art traditions helped revive folk arts. Church-wide folk-dancing festivals taught folk dancing to Mormon youth in the 1970s. Roadshows allowed members to exercise their creative talents on a smaller scale. In some missions, it is common to burn clothing to mark special missionary anniversaries, such as a tie after six months of service and a shirt after one year.  Material objects  = Handicrafts = Pine furniture, pottery, wool textiles, quilts, woodwork, decorative needlework, and toys have unique Mormon elements. In early Mormon history, pioneers gathered in Utah from Europe and other parts of the world, bringing their knowledge of handicrafts with them. Utah pioneers were isolated and had to make most of their own clothes and linens. They adapted the techniques they knew to the materials they had on hand. Local historian Shirley B. Paxman argues that the pioneers's limited materials combined with their isolation resulted in work that was not self-conscious. Since pioneer women did not think of themselves as artists, their decorative work was for their own or their family's simple pleasure. Pioneer women in Utah made their own yarn, linen thread and silk thread. In the 1870s, pioneer women sold their handicrafts in cooperative stores owned by the Relief Society. When handicrafts were no longer a necessity, they were promoted as improving mental health. Handicrafts for Women, published by the Relief Society in 1935, encouraged women to learn handicrafts to relieve them of the monotony of housework. In the early 20th century, Relief Societies held monthly homemaking days to learn and practice household arts and crafts including needlework and quilting. In 1963, handicrafts saw a resurgence in popularity that coincided with the Relief Society Magazine's new feature on arts and crafts. Relief Society crafts are one way that folk art is disseminated between Mormons. In 1963, crafter Ruby Swallow made resin grapes using old Christmas ornaments as molds. She presented the craft at a stake homemaking activity, and soon after taught her technique in a local craft store. The craft remained unusually popular, and many homes in the Intermountain West had a set by the 1970s. Eleanor Zimmerman, who helped popularize the grapes, said that the craft was popular because it was handmade but \\"looked store-bought.\\" Mark L. Staker, a curator for the Museum of Church History and Art, believes that the staying power of resin grapes is partially because they were made as a community, and also because Relief Society Magazine began emphasizing arts and crafts in 1963. One popular genre of crafts turns inexpensive utilitarian objects into decorative ones. Utahns created a Utah quilt guild in 1977 to promote and preserve quilt making techniques. In documenting pioneer quilts, the Utah quilt guild found a wide variety of styles, including paper piecing, applique, and crazy quilt styles. Quilts were a common wedding gift. Pioneer quilts often featured natural imagery, with sego lilies and beehives being special symbols of Mormon pioneers. English and humanities professor Yvonne Milspaw studied contemporary American regional quilting and found that Utah Mormon quilters were the most innovative and relaxed about traditional quilt patterns. Pictoral quilts and quilts that incorporate memorabilia, like boy scout badges and silk-screened photos, were common. The annual Springville Quilt Show accepts both hand-stitched and machine-quilted quilts. Hair jewellery and wreaths were among the popular handicrafts in the 19th century, especially in the 1860s and '70s. Hair flowers made by Mormons, like those in the rest of the United States, traditionally had a woman's hair for the petals and her husband's for the center. Watch chains made from hair were commonly sent to missionaries to remind them of family members. The Salt Lake temple entrance had a hair wreath containing hair from prominent church leaders on display until 1967. Hair wreaths containing hair from multiple people were displayed in public areas, symbolizing community unity. File:Christmas sampler patch quilt.jpgBook Club Friends 4ever quilted by Dixie Davies.

File:Human Hair Bracelet 1.jpgHuman Hair Bracelet belonging to Zina Presendia Young Williams Card Vinyl I Spy.jpgHidden object toy Handmade baby dolls.jpgHandmade dolls = Furniture = Early Utah pioneers in 1847 used wood from hardwood packing boxes as material for furniture. Steam-driven lathes made Roman turned legs and furniture with spool-turned decoration popular. Leaders encouraged craftsmanship, and cabinetmakers made their own designs, usually influenced by fashionable designs like the Empire style. Furniture makers adapted designs to local softwoods like cottonwood, box elder, and red and yellow pine. The legs and spindles of furniture made with soft wood had to be thicker to accommodate the same amount of weight as furniture made with hardwood. In the 1850s and 60s, furniture was in great demand, but by 1869, there were enough cabinetmakers to create a variety of competing styles. William Bell, a cabinetmaker from England, worked for Brigham Young and made a variety of simple yet fashionable pieces. He crafted a few unique pieces, including an octagonal rotating desk with painted graining to simulate other textures, and a reclining chair. Ralph Ramsay, another Mormon pioneer furniture maker, used Bell's workshop to carve a large eagle that decorated the entrance to Brigham Young's property. Ramsay carved many other details iconic to Mormon architecture, including the original oxen supporting baptismal fonts in temples, the casework for the Salt Lake Tabernacle organ, and an ornate personal bed. File:309 MSS P 24 B2 F13.jpgEagle gate made by Ralph Ramsay File:308 MSS P 24 B2 F13.jpgSalt Lake Tabernacle organ in 1901 Other pioneer craftsmen tried to adapt to conditions in Utah. Potters made jars and pots for local needs. Local soil was high in alkali, and traditional glazes were ineffective. Pioneers preferred the cheaper factory-made pottery, and by the end of the 19th century, only Erich C. Henrichsen's pottery remained in business, selling unglazed machine-made flower pots. Blacksmiths recycled any metal they could find and had consistent work to do, shoeing horses and repairing farm equipment. By the 1890s, most craftsmen were struggling to support themselves, as they could not compete with factory-made goods brought by the railway. Since the church's emphasis on emergency preparedness, some Mormons have created storage space for preserved food inside furniture. = Architecture = Rural Mormon settlements have several features that, when found together, distinguish them from non-Mormon settlements. These include wide roads, irrigation ditches, unpainted barns, and special wooden hay derricks. Lombardy poplars were often grown in rows to act as a windbreak, and streets were often numbered in grid fashion. A two-story symmetrical home with a chimney on either end was popular, and called \\"I\\"-style or \\"Nauvoo\\"-style homes. \\"I\\"-style homes were often built adjoining one another in \\"L\\", \\"H\\", or \\"T\\" style homes. Homes were often built using adobe. Brigham Young instructed pioneers to build \\"beautiful\\" houses, and from 1847‚Äì1890, architects experimented with various decorations they found in house pattern books. Greek revival-inspired decorations included window heads in pediment shape, entablature, and plain cornice returns. For Gothic revival decorations, architects used intricate bargeboards and spired finials to traditional house plans. Dormers were popular and were built in many varying styles. Late 19th- century styles like Victorian were not common. Traditional house plans came from Colonial Georgian architecture. External designs were usually bilaterally symmetric, with three distinct components, one of which was centered to preserve symmetry. Second-story windows were built direct above first-story windows in this style. Architectural eclecticism was common, and architects sometimes used unusual solutions to create symmetric facades. Children near a farm in Willard, Utah.jpgWillard, Utah with Poplars in the background File:George M. Brown House.jpgGeorge M. Brown House, built in the 1880s, uses bilateral triparte symmetry in its facade. The decorations are in the Gothic revival style. File:Thomas Taylor House.jpgClark‚ÄìTaylor House, built around 1854 = Gravestones = In the 19th century, the most popular symbol for gravestones in the Mormon cultural region was that of two hands clasped, as if in a handshake. Carol Edison, former director of the Utah Art Council's Folk Arts Program, interprets the symbol as having multiple meanings, representing either a goodbye to living relatives or a greeting to deceased relatives. The clasped hands design was especially popular for upright marble grave markers. Starting around 1910, images of temples on gravestones appeared, reinforcing Mormon beliefs about families remaining together after death. With sandblasting technology in the 1960s, carving images of temples became much easier. Over a quarter of gravestone orders in 2013 included a temple image. Many temple gravestones include the names of husband and wife on the same gravestone and the date of their temple sealing. The names of the children of the couple are sometimes also listed on the gravestone, showing the importance of the family unit.  Mormon fundamentalists  Mormon fundamentalist communities practice polygamy. A few sects practice arranged marriages, but it is \\"probably more common\\" for spouses to court a wife through religious persuasion. Fundamentalists describe their practice of polygamy as a vital part of their religious devotion. Family organization depends on individual style; in some families, the first wife takes a superior role to the younger wives; in others, they are scrupulously treated equally. Traditional dances are popular, especially the double scottische. Modest but modern clothing is common. Fundamentalist communities strongly value frugal cooperative self- reliance, often home-schooling their children and relying on alternative medicine. Many families receive financial assistance from the government. Past government raids provide touchstones for communal memory, and members recount their own and their ancestors' experiences with persecution.

It was founded by research students and academics in 1990 at the London School of Economics, where the headquarters of the Association are based. The objectives of the Association are to establish an international and interdisciplinary network of scholars interested in ethnicity and nationalism; stimulate debate on ethnicity and nationalism through the organisation of seminars, workshops, lectures and conferences; disseminate information on scholarly activities concerning ethnicity and nationalism; and publish research on ethnicity and nationalism in its journals Nations and Nationalism and Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism. Administration Anthony D. Smith was the President of the Association from its founding until 2013, when he was replaced by John Breuilly. The current Vice Presidents are John Breuilly, Eric Kaufmann, and John Hutchinson. The Association also has an Advisory Council, which is composed of more than twenty experts on ethnicity and nationalism from around the world. Publications left The Association publishes two journals: Nations and Nationalism, one of the most cited in the field, and Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism (formerly The ASEN Bulletin), which publishes research from young scholars, junior faculty, post-doctoral researchers and graduate students. The first issue of Nations and Nationalism was published in March 1995. In their editorial for that issue, Anthony D. Smith, Obi Igwara, Athena Leoussi, and Terry Mulhall described the need for a journal devoted to the study of nations and nationalism, and identified the three basic aims of the journal as: \\"(1) to be the vehicle of new research, both theoretical and empirical, and act as a forum for the exchange of views in the field; (2) to identify and develop a separate subject-area as a field of study in its own right, and unify the body of scholars in the field; [and] (3) to bring to the attention of the wider scholarly community, and the public, the need to treat the subject-area as a well-defined field of interdisciplinary study, which requires the collaboration of scholars from a variety of intellectual backgrounds.\\" Nations and Nationalism has been selected to be indexed in the Current Contents: Social & Behavioral Sciences Index and the Social Sciences Citation Index, but the impact factor has not yet been announced. Other activities =Conferences= Each spring, the Association organises one of the largest annual conferences in the interdisciplinary field of nationalism studies, hosted at the London School of Economics. Its 2008 conference, titled Nationalism, East and West: Civic and Ethnic Conceptions of Nationhood, was held in April and was the largest to date. The title of this year's conference is Nationalism and Globalisation. Past conference titles include: The Dark Face of Nationalism: Violence, Extremism and the Nation (2007); Nations and their Pasts: Representing the Past, Building the Future (2006); and Nation and Empire (2005). =Lectures, seminars and debates= The Association organises and hosts a range of different events at the London School of Economics including lectures, seminars and debates that feature prominent scholars. The Ernest Gellner Nationalism Lecture and the Nations and Nationalism Debate are annual, and a number of smaller seminars are held more frequently throughout the year. =Essay prize= The Dominique Jacquin-Berdal ASEN Prize, established to honour the memory of a late ASEN member and editor of Nations and Nationalism, is awarded annually to the author of a submitted paper \\"to encourage young scholars to publish original research in ethnicity and nationalism.\\" The prize includes ¬£250 and 2 years' free membership in the ASEN, and may lead to publication of the article in Nations and Nationalism. =Mailing list= The Association also maintains a mailing list, called Nationalism Research, which \\"provides members information on conferences, including calls for papers; new publications in the field; scholarships for students and researchers; jobs in academia; and events organised by the Association for the Study of Ethnicity and Nationalism at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\\" Similar organisations * Association for the Study of Nationalities (ASN) * Association for Research on Ethnicity and Nationalism in the Americas (ARENA) Notes External links * Category:Academic organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations (nationalism studies) Category:Nationalist organizations Category:Organizations established in 1990 Category:Educational organisations based in London ","title":"Association for the Study of Ethnicity and Nationalism"},{"id":"13884454","text":"Bruce Haywood (30 September 1925 ‚Äì 7 January 2020) was an English-born American academic, who served as a professor of German language and literature, dean and provost of Kenyon College and was president of Monmouth College in Illinois.Publishers Information He died in January 2020 at the age of 94.FORMER MONMOUTH COLLEGE PRESIDENT HAYWOOD DIES AT 94 Early life and education Born in York, England in 1925, Haywood was raised in Allerton Bywater, Yorkshire.

Early life Frederick Bayer was born on Halloween night 1921, in Asbury Park, New Jersey, but spent much of his childhood in south Florida, where he collected seashells and became an amateur naturalist. Bayer joined the Army Air Forces from December 1942 to December 1945. While in the Army Air Forces, he was a photographic technician with the 36th Photo Reconnaissance unit in the Pacific War during World War II. While in the military, he often sketched and collected fish, shells and butterflies throughout New Guinea, the Philippines, and Okinawa. Bayer received his bachelor's degree from the University of Miami. He continued his studies and obtained a master's degree in taxonomy from George Washington University in 1954. In 1958, he completed a doctorate in taxonomy from George Washington University. Career Bayer worked at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History from 1947 until 1961. He returned to work at the museum again from 1975 until 1996. He served as a professor at the University of Miami's marine science school between 1961 and 1975. While at Miami, Bayer participated in a number of soft coral- collecting expeditions in the Caribbean Sea and in the waters off West Africa. Following his arrival at the Smithsonian, Bayer was sent to Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean to study the effects of nuclear testing on the island's marine life, as part of the re-survey conducted one year after the Able and Baker tests of 1946 were carried out. Bayer also spent several months doing field research throughout the rest of Micronesia. Bayer wrote over 130 scholarly papers on the history and taxonomy of soft coral. He focused much of his soft coral research on octocorals, which include sea fans and sea whips. He discovered 170 new species of marine life, 40 new genera, and three new families. Japan's Emperor Hirohito, who was also a marine biologist, actually named a hydroid, Hydractinia bayeri, in honor of Frederick Bayer. Bayer returned the favor while Hirohito was on a state visit to Washington, D.C. in 1975. He presented Hirohito with a rare snail shell which was the \\"size of a hat.\\" Bayer served as a member of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature from 1972 to 1995. He was also an accomplished bio-illustrator. Bayer painted and designed a total of fourteen scientifically accurate marine scenes. These particular scenes were used for a set of Haitian postage stamps in 1973.

Although the workers from Mongolia comprised 3.6% of the foreign workforce , the group has grown over the last decade and numbered 10,236 men and women holding Mongolian nationality by June 2020. By 2011 they had declined both in numbers and in relative size to other foreign populations, having been surpassed by Russians and Moldovans. However, the group began to resume its growth after 2014 once again. Currently, a large group of Mongolians reside in the city of Ceska Lipa and its surrounding area. Migration history In 2005, only 1,900 Mongolians lived in the Czech Republic, according to the local police; by 31 March 2006, that figure had grown slightly to 2,607 individuals, including 2,051 workers and 213 businessmen. The following year would see significant growth in the Mongolian population, which nearly tripled to 7,515 individuals by June 2007. As of July 2008, an additional thirty to forty Mongolians were arriving in the Czech Republic for work every week, many via train. Their population had been expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace, since Mongolia, along with Vietnam, was chosen in 2008 as one of the nations to supply manpower to the Czech Republic to replace North Korean guest workers, whose visas were not renewed after international concern that their wages were being confiscated by the North Korean government and used to support their nuclear programme. However, at the beginning of 2009, the Czech government decided they would no longer grant employment visas to Mongolian or Vietnamese labourers, in response to an economic downturn which had left 380,000 Czech citizens jobless. Visa issuance officially halted on 1 April that year; the government stated it would resume at some unspecified future date. They also announced a plan to offer ‚Ç¨500 and a free plane ticket back to Ulaanbaatar for any Mongolian workers in the Czech Republic who lost their jobs; a spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry stated that the plan was intended to prevent unemployed foreign workers from remaining in the country illegally. From February-April, Mongolians formed 66% of the total 1,345 foreigners who took advantage of such offers from the Czech government. In May 2011, a group of ninety Mongolians sued the Czech government over the restricted access to work visas, and in particular for refusing to process their applications online through the Visapoint system. Demography and distribution Aside from the community in Prague, there are also about 500 Mongolians employed at a steering wheel-cover firm in the South Moravian Region town of Blansko, and a few hundred more in Plze≈à. Illegal migration Mongolians make up one of the larger groups of illegal migrants detained at the border with Slovakia. Previously, Ukraine had been one of the main sources of illegal foreign workers for the Czech Republic, but many had moved on westward to other countries of the European Union, lured by higher wages; Mongolians have been one of the main groups which has replaced them. The Czech government are working with the Mongolian government in efforts to control the illegal migration, in a programme similar to those they already operated with the governments of Moldova, Armenia, and Ukraine, which combined education in the source country about the danger of abuse that foreign workers face, and increased enforcement in the destination country. There are fifteen Czech work agencies with permits from the Czech government to import workers from Mongolia. However, only two such agencies have permits from the Mongolian government to recruit on their territory; many thus operate without authorisation. This lack of registration is the reason why Czech government figures consistently show a large number of migrants from Mongoliasuch as a total of 2,000 in 2007while Mongolian government statistics show just a small number of workers leaving their country with the Czech Republic as their destination.

He is known for his work on the adventure strips Steve Roper (later Steve Roper and Mike Nomad) and Jeff Cobb.  Biography  =Early life= Born in Toledo, Ohio, the youngest of four children of Rose and Abraham Hoffman, Hoffman showed artistic talent early, publishing an Old West-themed drawing in the Toledo Times when just a kindergartner at Warren School. He attended the University of Toledo, where he earned a bachelor's degree in advertising and marketing while cartooning for the student newspaper and serving as art editor of the yearbook. After working for six months as an advertising artist for a local department store, Hoffman served in the U.S. Army Air Corps in England during World War II, achieving the rank of captain and receiving the Bronze Star Medal. Early career Afterwards, he returned to Toledo and stopped by to see Steve Roper authors Allen Saunders and Elmer Woggon; he had met them as a student cartoonist and had been sending them additional sketches during the war. Liking his work, Saunders hired him as a new ghost for Woggon because Publishers Syndicate had complained that the artwork still looked too cartoonish for an adventure strip. The strip continued to appear as \\"Steve Roper by Saunders and Woggon.\\" Hoffman's name was seen only in the sequence of June 9‚Äì14, 1947, when Roper's friend Sonny Brawnski wrestled \\"Poison Pete Hoffman\\" after threatening to throw him into Toledo's Maumee River. Hoffman gave the postwar Steve Roper the more serious look it needed as it settled into a modern urban setting. Hoffman said of his work, \\"The strip was in a transition stage and a more illustrative style of drawing was desired. My style fit their needs. I enjoyed ghost-drawing the characters for nearly nine years.\\" The ghost was no secret, however: a 1953 article on Steve Roper in the Toledo Blade described Hoffman's role in the strip and pictured him working with Saunders and Woggon in their studio. =Jeff Cobb and Why We Say= Pete Hoffman's Why We Say (April 17, 1968) Hoffman launched his own strip on June 28, 1954, leaving Steve Roper to produce General Features' Jeff Cobb, about an investigative reporter for the Daily Guardian.Jeff Cobb at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on October 8, 2016. The parting was amicable, and Saunders and Woggon sponsored him when he joined the National Cartoonists Society in 1955. Hoffman said in said, \\"Hopefully, some of Allen Saunders' expertise rubbed off on me when I worked on Steve Roper.\\" Similarly to Steve Roper, Cobb was an attractive, clean-cut, two-fisted reporter who defended his standards, fought crime, and endured near-fatal threats to his life. On the other hand, Hoffman's Jeff Cobb developed a greater range of expression and a more mature level of fine-line photorealism than his Roper. Like Saunders, he also emphasized characterization in plot development, and said he never ran out of ideas; stories were inspired by newspaper articles he read, and characters were often based on real people. During this same period, Hoffman illustrated the single-panel feature Why We Say (also for General Features; 1950‚Äì78), which was written by Robert Morgan and explained word and phrase origins in laypersons' terms.. = Later career = When Jeff Cobb ended in 1978, \\"a victim of the phase-out\\" of newspaper continuity strips in general, Hoffman turned to freelance work and University of Toledo alumni projects.  Honors  Hoffman continued to live in his native Toledo, and in 2004, on the 50th anniversary of Jeff Cobb, he was honored there by fans and by a collection of fellow cartoonists' caricatures, each sporting a Jeff Cobb eye-patch.  Personal life  Hoffman never married, regarding himself as \\"married to the drawing board\\". He died of a heart attack, aged 94.

The Evenks, Tungusic peoples, tribes, in Russia, Mongolia and China also use chums. They are also used by the southernmost reindeer herders, of the Todzha region of the Republic of Tyva and their cross-border relatives in northern Mongolia.

In the middle there is a fireplace used for heating and to keep the mosquitoes away. The smoke escapes through a hole on top of the chum. The canvas and wooden poles are usually quite heavy, but could be transported by using their reindeer. The chum is still in use today as a year- round shelter for the Yamal-Nenets, Khanty and Todzha Tyvan people of Russia. In Russian use, the terms chum, yurt and yaranga may be used interchangeably.

The band released two full albums, Playdoh Meathook (1987) and Rassafranna (1989), plus an EP, Second Third Time Around (1990).

She then took part in Il bacio (The kiss), a fantasy drama directed by Mario Lanfranchi, and in erotic comedies such as Salvatore Samperi's La sbandata (1974), in which she plays near Domenico Modugno and Luciana Paluzzi, Luciano Salce's Alla mia cara mamma nel giorno del suo compleanno (1974), Pasquale Festa Campanile's Conviene far bene l'amore (U.S. title: Love and Energy) (1975) and Gianluigi Calderone's Appassionata, that definitively gaine her the public acclaim. leftRoles in movies like Franco Brusati's To Forget Venice (1979), Dario Argento's Inferno (1980), Nino Manfredi's Nudo di donna (1981), and Liliana Cavani's Beyond Obsession (1982) are some of her most known and remarkable dramatic performances but in the beginning of the eighties, Giorgi decides to rejoin comedy. She's near Adriano Celentano in Mani di fata and Grand hotel excelsior; for her performance in Carlo Verdone's Borotalco (1982), she won the Nastro d'Argento award and David di Donatello award for Best Actress. In 2003, Giorgi wrote and directed her first film Uomini & donne, amori & bugie (U.S. title: Love, Lies, Kids... & Dogs), with Ornella Muti.

The intent is to illustrate the hierarchical structure and relationship of events, accomplishments, criteria, and tasks. In the United States Department of Defense, the Integrated Master Plan (IMP) and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) are important program management tools that provide significant assistance in the planning and scheduling of work efforts in large and complex materiel acquisitions. The IMP is an event-driven plan that documents the significant accomplishments necessary to complete the work and ties each accomplishment to a key program event. The IMP is expanded to a time-based IMS to produce a networked and multi-layered schedule showing all detailed tasks required to accomplish the work effort contained in the IMP. The IMS flows directly from the IMP and supplements it with additional levels of detail‚Äî‚Äîboth then form the foundations to implement an Earned Value Management System. * The IMP is a bilateral agreement between the Government and a contractor on what defines the ‚Äúevent-driven‚Äù program. The IMP documents the key events, accomplishments, and the evaluation \\"criteria\\" in the development, production and/or modification of a military system; moreover, the IMS provides sequential events and key decision points (generally meetings) to assess program progress. Usually the IMP is a contractual document. * Supporting the IMP is the IMS that is made up of \\"tasks\\" depicting the work effort needed to complete the \\"criteria\\". It is a detailed time-driven plan for program execution that helps to ensure on-time delivery dates are achieved, and that tracking and status tool are used during program execution. These tools must show progress, interrelationships and dependencies. In civic planning or urban planning, Integrated Master Plan is used at the levels of city development, county, and state or province to refer to a document integrating diverse aspects of a public works project.  Purpose and Objectives  The primary purpose of the IMP‚Äîand the supporting detailed schedules of the IMS‚Äîis their use by the U.S. Government and Contractor acquisition team as the day-to-day tools for the planning, executing, and tracking program technical, schedule, and cost status, including risk mitigation efforts. The IMP provides a better structure than either the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) or Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS) for measuring actual integrated master schedule (IMS) progress. The primary objective of the IMP is a single plan that establishes the program or project fundamentals. It provides a hierarchical, event-based plan that contains: Events; Significant accomplishments; Entry and exit criteria; however it does not include any dates or durations. Using the IMP provides sufficient definition for explain program process and completion tracking, as well as providing effective communication of the program/project content and the \\"What and How\\" of the program.  Rationale  The IMP is a collection of milestones (called \\"events\\") that form the process architecture of the program. This means the sequence of events must always result in a deliverable product or service. While delivering products or services is relatively straight forward in some instances (i.e., list the tasks to be done, arrange them in the proper sequence, and execute to this ‚Äúplan‚Äù), in other cases, problems often arise: (i) the description of \\"complete\\" is often missing for intermediate activities; (ii) program partners, integration activities, and subcontractors all have unknown or possibly unknowable impacts on the program; and (iii) as products or services are delivered the maturity of the program changes (e.g., quality and functionality expectations, as well as other attributes)‚Äî‚Äîthis maturity provided by defining \\"complete\\" serves as an insurance policy against future problems encountered later in the program. Often, it's easier to define the IMP by stating what it is not. The IMP is NOT BASED on calendar dates, and therefore it is not schedule oriented; each event is completed when its supporting accomplishments are completed, and this completion is evidenced by the satisfaction of the criteria supporting each of the accomplishments. Furthermore, many of the IMP events are fixed by customer-defined milestones (e.g., Preliminary or Critical Design Review, Production Deliver, etc.) while intermediate events are defined by the Supplier (e.g., integration and test, software build releases, Test Readiness Review, etc.). The critical IMP attribute is its focus on events, when compared to effort or task focused planning. The event focus asks and answers the question what does done look like? rather than what work has been done. Certainly work must be done to complete a task, but a focus solely on the work hides the more important metric of are we meeting our commitments? While meeting commitments is critical, it's important to first define the criteria used for judging if the commitments are being met. This is where Significant Accomplishments (SA) and their Accomplishment Criteria (AC) become important. It is important to meet commitments, but recognizing when the commitment has been met is even more important.  Attributes and Characteristics  The IMP provides Program Traceability by expanding and complying with the program's Statement of Objectives (SOO), Technical Performance Requirements (TPRs), the Contract Work Breakdown Structure (CWBS), and the Contract Statement of Work (CSOW)‚Äîall of which are based on the Customer's WBS to form the basis of the IMS and all cost reporting. The IMP implements a measurable and trackable program structure to accomplish integrated product development, integrate the functional program activities, and incorporates functional, lower-level and subcontractor IMPs. The IMP provides a framework for independent evaluation of Program Maturity by allowing insight into the overall effort with a level-of- detail that is consistent with levied risk and complexity metrics. It uses the methodology of decomposing events into a logical series of accomplishments having measurable criteria to demonstrate the completion and/or quality of accomplishments.  Requirements Flowdown  A Government customer tasks a Supplier to prepare and implement an IMP that linked with the IMS and integrated with the EVMS. The IMP list the contract requirements documents (e.g., Systems Requirements Document and Technical Requirements Document (i.e., the system specification or similar document)) as well as the IMP events corresponding to development and/or production activities required by the contract. The IMP should include significant accomplishments encompassing all steps necessary to satisfy all contract objectives and requirements, manage all significant risks, and facilitate Government insight for each event. Significant accomplishments shall be networked to show their logical relationships and that they flow logically from one to another. The IMP, IMS, and EVMS products will usually include the prime contractor, subcontractor, and major vendor activities and products.  Evaluation of an IMS  When evaluating a proposed IMS, the user should focus on realistic task durations, predecessor/successor relationships, and identification of critical path tasks with viable risk mitigation and contingency plans. An IMS summarized at too high a level may result in obscuring critical execution elements, and contributing to failure of the EVMS to report progress. A high-level IMS may fail to show related risk management approaches being used, which can result in long duration tasks and artificial linkages masking the true critical path. In general, the IMP is a top-down planning tool and the IMS as the bottom-up execution tool. The IMS is a scheduling tool for management control of program progression, not for cost collection purposes. An IMS would seek general consistency and a standardized approach to project planning, scheduling and analysis. It may use guides such as the PASEG Generally Accepted Schedule Principles (GASP) as guidance to improve execution and enable EVMS.  Relationship to other Documents  The IMP/IMS are related to the product- based Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) as defined in MIL-STD-881, by giving a second type of view on the effort, for different audiences or to provide a combination which gives better overall understanding. Linkage between the IMP/IMS and WBS is done by referencing the WBS numbering whenever the PE (Program Event), SA (Significant Accomplishment), or AC (Accomplishment Criteria) involves a deliverable product.  Reporting Formats  The IMP is often called out as a contract data deliverable on United States Department of Defense materiel acquisitions, as well as other U.S. Government procurements. Formats for these deliverables are covered in Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) that define the data content, format, and data usages. Recently, the DoD cancelled the DID (DI-MISC-81183A) that jointly addressed both the IMP and the IMS. The replacement documents include DI-MGMT-81650 (Integrated Master Schedule), DI-MGMT-81334A (Contract Work Breakdown Structure) and DI- MGMT-81466 (Contract Performance Report). In addition DFARS 252.242‚Äì7001 and 252.242‚Äì7002 provide guidance for integrating IMP/IMS with Earned Value Management.

Early work  Rochester received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1941. He stayed on at MIT, working in the Radiation Laboratory for three years and then moved to Sylvania Electric Products where he was responsible for the design and construction of radar sets and other military equipment. His group built the arithmetic element for the Whirlwind I computer at MIT.  IBM 701 computer  In 1948, Rochester moved to IBM where he designed the IBM 701, the first general-purpose, mass-produced computer. He wrote the first symbolic assembler, which allowed programs to be written in short, readable commands rather than pure numbers or punch codes. He became the chief engineer of IBM's 700 series of computers.  Artificial intelligence  In 1955, IBM organized a group to study pattern recognition, information theory and switching circuit theory, headed by Rochester. Among other projects, the group simulated the behaviour of abstract neural networks on an IBM 704 computer. That summer John McCarthy, a young Dartmouth College mathematician, was also working at IBM. He and Marvin Minsky had begun to talk seriously about the idea of intelligent machines. They approached Rochester and Claude Shannon with a proposal for a conference on the subject. With the support of the two senior scientists, they secured $7,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation to fund a conference in the summer of 1956. and see The meeting, now known as the Dartmouth Conference, is widely considered the \\"birth of artificial intelligence.\\" Rochester continued to supervise artificial intelligence projects at IBM, including Arthur Samuel's checkers program, Herbert Gelernter's Geometry Theorem Prover and Alex Bernstein's chess program. In 1958, he was a visiting professor at MIT, where he helped McCarthy with the development of Lisp programming language. The artificial intelligence programs developed at IBM began to generate a great deal of publicity and were featured in articles in both Scientific American and The New York Times. IBM shareholders began to pressure Thomas J. Watson Jr., the president of IBM, to explain why research dollars were being used for such \\"frivolous matters.\\" In addition, IBM's marketing people had begun to notice that customers were frightened of the idea of \\"electronic brains\\" and \\"thinking machines\\". An internal report prepared around 1960 recommended that IBM end broad support for AI and so the company ended its AI program and began to aggressively spread the message that \\"computers can only do what they were told.\\"  Later work  In the 1960s, Rochester continued to work at IBM, directing cutting edge research in cryogenics and tunnel diode circuits. By 1975 he was working at IBM Cambridge Research on the IBM Chord Keyboard. Later he joined IBM's Data Systems Division and developed programming languages and advanced computer science.  Recognition  Rochester was appointed an IBM Fellow in 1967, the company's highest technical position. In 1984 he received the Computer Pioneer Award from the IEEE Computer Society.

This was to be a state institution of higher education. In November 1859, the institution's main building was completed near Pineville, Louisiana. The original location of the Old LSU Site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The institution's first superintendent was Major William Tecumseh Sherman.letter from probably 1859 (before the school opened in January 1860) from the Seminary of Learning of the State of Louisiana to cadets ref. Maj. W. T. Sherman On January 2, 1860, the college opened with five professors and 19 cadets. In March 1860, the school's name was changed to Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy (le Lycee Scientifique et Militaire de l'Etat de la Louisiane). The state's general assembly allowed for as many as 150 cadets, with scholarships for boarding expenses. The total number of cadets eventually reached 73. The cadets were referred to as \\"beneficiary\\" cadets. After the state of Louisiana seceded from the Union in January 1861, Major Sherman resigned as superintendent of the school. In April 1861, large numbers of students and faculty began resigning in order to enlist in the Confederate military. On June 30, 1861, the seminary closed. It later reopened on April 1, 1862 with Rev. W.E.M. Linfield as acting superintendent. Cannons donated by Gen. Sherman from the Civil War in front of LSU's Military Science/Aerospace Studies Building On April 1, 1863, Prof. William A. Seay became superintendent. On April 23, 1863, the seminary again closed down due to the invasion in the area of Union forces in the Red River Campaign. Before being captured, the college's military equipment was donated to the Confederate Army. The school's library and other items were destroyed by order of Gen. T. Kilby Smith of the U.S. Army. The school's building was saved due to a request by Gen. W. T. Sherman. After the end of the Civil War, in April 1865, the seminary was again reopened on October 2, 1865, with Col. David F. Boyd as superintendent. Following the war, General Sherman donated two cannons to the institution. According to legend, these cannons had been captured from Confederate forces and had been used to start the war when fired at Fort Sumter, SC.

It was held on February 22, 1959, in front of 41,921 spectators.Race results; Retrieved October 24, 2007. It was the first race held at the 2.5-mile (4.0 kilometer) Daytona International Speedway.  Background  Map of Daytona International Speedway, the track where the race was held. Daytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that was one of the first superspeedways to hold NASCAR races. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd. The speedway is currently owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation. The track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since 1995, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers. Race report =Qualifying= Cotton Owens had the fastest qualifying lap, at 143.198 miles per hour (mph) (230.45 kilometres per hour [km/h]).

Lee Petty battled with Beauchamp during the final 30 laps of the race, and they were the only two drivers to finish on the lead lap. Petty took the lead with 3 laps left and led at the start of the final lap. Petty and Beauchamp drove side by side across the finish line at the end final lap for a photo finish. Beauchamp was declared the unofficial winner by NASCAR officials, and he drove to victory lane. Petty protested the results, saying \\"I had Beauchamp by a good two feet.

Prospective officers complete Phase I (BOLC A) as either a cadet (United States Military Academy or Reserve Officers' Training Corps) or an officer candidate (Officer Candidate School (United States Army)) before continuing on to BOLC B as Second Lieutenants. If BOLC B is not completed within two years of commissioning, 2LTs will be administratively separated from the service unless there are extenuating circumstances. This a progressive model designed to produce US Army officers with leadership skills, small unit tactics and certain branch-specific capabilities.  BOLC A  All Army officers, Phase I of BOLC consists of pre-commissioning training, either through Reserve Officers' Training Corps, Officer Candidate School, or the United States Military Academy. It is at this stage the officer candidate learns basic leadership skills and basic small unit tactics. Direct commissioned officers (many within AMEDD Corps-such as doctors, nurses, veterinarians and medical service corps- and JAG Corps), who have no commissioning source must attend the Direct Commission Course (DCC). DCC consists of a six-week course at Ft. Benning, Georgia or Ft Sill, OK (AMEDD). The primary purpose of this training is to provide basic military training to obtain the skills necessary to continue on to BOLC B. DCC is required for all direct commissioned officers regardless of prior service experience.  BOLC B  The second phase of the Basic Officer Leader Course - previously referred to as the Officer Basic Course (OBC) and BOLC III - is designed to develop new combat-effective officers and train them to perform their wartime duties as commissioned officers. It is during this phase that they learn the specifics of the systems and equipment they will use in their duty unit. * Chemical, Engineer, and Military Police officers train at the U.S. Army Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE) at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. * Infantry and Armor officers train at the U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) at Fort Benning, Georgia.http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/199th/ibolc/http://www.benning.army.mil/armor/ * Signal Corps and Cyber Corps officers train at Fort Gordon, Georgia. * Military Intelligence officers train at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. * Adjutant General, Finance and Chaplain Corps officers train at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. * Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery officers train at the U.S. Army Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.http://sill-www.army.mil/BOLC-B_1/index.htm * Logistics (Transportation, Ordnance, and Quartermaster) officers train at the Army Logistics University (ALU) at Fort Lee, Virginia. * Aviation officers train at Fort Rucker, Alabama.http://www.rucker.army.mil/usaace/ * Army Medical Department (AMEDD) officers train at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. * Judge Advocate General's Corps officers train at The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School in Charlottesville, Virginia.https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/Sites/tjaglcs.nsf/homeContent.xsp?open&documentId;=1AA8592B56D0ADE585257BB1006B8FA4  Notes  * BOLC II was a 7 week combat preparation course located at Fort Sill, OK and Fort Benning, GA. It was discontinued at the end of 2009, and as of 2010, any required training has now been merged into BOLC B (formerly BOLC III). * Until June 2013, Army Judge Advocates, complete their training in reverse order, first attending BOLC B at The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School (TJAGLCS) in Charlottesville, Va., and then attend the DCC course at Fort Benning. As of the 191st Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course (JAOBC), the direct commissionees will attend DCC first and then attend BOLC B at TJAGLCS. * Chaplains, who are direct commissioned, complete initial training and BOLC in one setting at the US Army Chaplain Center and School (USACHCS) located in Fort Jackson (South Carolina). The initial phase is called Chaplain Initial Military Training (CIMT) with the remaining three phases consisting of Chaplains BOLC (CH-BOLC).

He met his wife Jennifer Joslyn while performing in New York City in 1982, and married her after a short acquaintance. She then moved to Israel to live with him. They had three sons, Eliran, Ariel, and Daniel.http://www.mako.co.il/music-24/tavories- articles/Article-0deba4aa9a56621004.htm One of his songs, Eliran, is named for his firstborn son. After divorcing Joslyn, Tavori married a 17-year-old Israeli model, Aviva Azulai, with whom he had two children, son Ben El Tavori and daughter Bat-El Tavori. Tavori later divorced Azulai and married Osnat Lorber. They had two children, Orel and Elad, before divorcing.Kol Ness Ziona, \\"From 'Big Brother' to Big Comeback,\\" August 14, 2009, vol. 866 (Hebrew)http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3687671,00.html After their divorce, Tavori married and later divorced Sylvia Ziv, a resident of Los Angeles with whom he had a long distance relationship. He later entered a relationship with Yehudit Bauman, who claims to be the daughter of Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni through a brief holiday romance with her mother.http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Entertainment/CELEBRITY- GRAPEVINE-64310 Tavori married her in 2016.http://www.mako.co.il/entertainment-celebs/local-2016/Article- fa0fe3a7831b551006.htm He is rumored to be the father of Bauman's daughter, Karin, who is a model. Several of Tavori's children are also involved in the music world. His son Daniel was a contestant on Kokhav Nolad, and has also performed as a drummer, participating in one of Tavori's singles. His son Eliran works with him in concerts and is a music producer. His son Ben El Tavori is a prominent Israeli singer, and part of a famous musical duo with the singer Liraz Russo, known as \\"Static\\". In 1983, he won 145,000 shekels in the Toto lottery. Singing career Tavori in 1981 Tavori started out singing at nightclubs in Ramla, among them Calipso and Karish. After his service in the Israel Defense Forces, he recorded his first song, Helena, which was coldly received at first but later became a hit. His first major break came after David Halfon heard him perform a song that Halfon had written for another singer. Halfon introduced Tavori to Uzi Hitman in his early days as a songwriter.Collaboration with Uzi Hitman In 1976, the collaboration with Hitman led to Tavori's first record, Chipasti Shirim La'Tzet La'Olam (\\"I searched for songs to go out to the world\\"; ), including his first hit, Eyn Lee Ahavah (\\"I have no love\\"; ), written by Eliezer Rabin. After the records release, Tavori was awarded first place in the Middle Eastern Singing Festival () with his song Shechora Ve'Nava\\" (\\"Black & Beautiful\\"). The following year Tavori placed second at the same festival with his song Kinor David, and in 1979 he once more placed first with the song Moshe, written for him by singer- songwriter Avihu Medina. Collaboration with Medina produced numbers like Shabhi Yerushalayim and Al Tashliheini Le'et Zikna, which became megahits for Tavori and other Mizrahi singers in Israel.Collaboration with Avihu Medina In 1982 Tavori turned down an offer to enter the festival again with the song written for him by Medina, Haperch Be'Gani (which ended up placing first when performed by Medina's second choice, Zohar Argov, launching his legendary career), choosing instead to go perform in New York City. In 1993 Tavori entered the Eurovision Song Contest with the song Chai Et Ma'She Yesh (\\"I Live With What I've Got\\"; ). Known also with the ballad \\"Remember\\" in the 80's (Big hit in Greece 1985-1986). In 2000, he released a triple album in French \\"Oriental Tempo\\" with international contributions of Turkish folk singer ƒ∞brahim Tatlƒ±ses, French entertainer Francky Perez, and Israeli musician and singer Meir Banai. In 2009, he finished second on the TV show HaAch HaGadol (VIP Big Brother).

The striking surface of the glove (facing down in this photo) is studded with nails driven into the glovePelota mixteca (\\"Mixtec-style ball\\") is a team sport similar to a net- less tennis game. The players wear sturdy, elaborately decorated gloves affixed to a heavy flat striking surface, using them to strike a small solid ball. The game has roots extending back hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of years. Today, the game is played in the Mexican state of Oaxaca and Guerrero and in emigrant communities including those in the Mexico City, Los Angeles and Fresno areas. The members of each five-player team take their positions on one-half of a long narrow court‚Äîroughly 100 m long by 11 m wide‚Äîwhich has been measured out on compacted soil. To serve, the ball is first bounced on a flat stone, and then struck on the rebound. The complex scoring system is similar to tennis.

He founded the Central Intelligence Agency's National Photographic Interpretation Center, now part of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Analyzing reconnaissance films, he briefed Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy as well as the nation's top military and diplomatic officials. Mr. Lundahl provided critical intelligence on the arms race and many other international crises, including those involving the Suez Canal; Quemoy and Matsu, islands controlled by Taiwan; Tibet; Lebanon, and Laos. Early career Born in Chicago, he trained in geology at the University of Chicago, obtaining a bachelor's degree in 1939 and a master's degree there in 1942. Early in his career, he combined his academic training as a geologist with his hobby as a photographer, and became expert in interpreting details of pictures and distinguishing natural features from manmade construction. He developed his new skills during World War II while serving in the Navy, studying aerial photographs of targets in Japan and the Aleutian and Kurile islands. Activities after World War II After the war ended, he became \\"Chief Engineer\\" of the Photogrammetry Division of the Naval Photographic Interpretation Center (the original NPIC, which subsequently became known as the Naval Reconnaissance Technical Support Center - NRTSC). In 1953, he moved to the CIA, to lead the \\"Photographic Interpretation Division (PID), manage both general photointerpretation and then the products, in the late fifties, of the U-2 program. In 1954 he served as President of the American Society of Photogrammetry (ASP). =NPIC and the U-2= In that effort, he combined photo interpretation, automatic data processing, photogrammetry, graphic arts, communications, collateral research, and technical analysis into the NPIC. According to his associate, Dino Brugioni, on July 4, 1956 using the U-2 aircraft, and within two months, the NPIC could put to rest the political accusation of a \\"bomber gap\\". Next, the U-2 was used tactically to keep US policymakers informed on the Suez Crisis of 1956. Other U-2 missions analyzed by NPIC included flyovers of Tibet, the offshore islands of the PRC, and Lebanon. Overflights of the USSR continued until a U-2 was shot down in May 1960. =Unidentified Flying Objects= CIA documents indicate that the agency monitored the UFO situation starting in 1952. Lundahl's first meeting with a study group was in 1967. Lundahl meets with Air Force contract team In 1967, the Air Force issued a contract, to the University of Colorado, for the study of unidentified flying objects. BG Edward B. Gillers, USAF, was the contract monitor, Dr. Thomas Rachford was the senior Air Force Scientist on the project, and the principal investigator from the University was Dr. E.U. Condon. \\"On 20 February 1967 at 0915 Dr. Condon and four members of his investigative team visited NPIC. With Dr. Condon were Dr. Richard Love, University of Colorado, Dr. David Saunders, University of Colorado, Dr. William Price, Executive Director of APRST, and Dr. Rachford, USAF. The purpose of this visit was to familiarize Dr. Condon and members of his team with selected photogrammetric and photographic analysis capabilities of NPIC. Lundahl met with investigators of UFO reports .\\" The meeting was allowed to discuss classified material through the SECRET level. NPIC established ground rules: In summary, Condon and the same group met again in May 1967 at NPIC to hear an analysis of UFO photographs taken at Zanesville, Ohio. The analysis debunked that sighting. The committee was again impressed with the technical work performed, and Condon remarked that for the first time a scientific analysis of a UFO would stand up to investigation. The Beginnings of Space- Based Photoreconnaissance Lundahl gathered the NPIC staff on August 19, 1960, to show them the images from the first photoreconnaissance satellite, Discoverer 14, to fly with its camera. Introducing \\"something new and great we've got here.\\" First showing a map of the Eastern Europe USSR, which previously had had a narrow line of photography from a U-2 high-altitude photographic aircraft, the new one had eight broad swaths running north to south across the USSR and Eastern Europe, covering over one-fifth of their total area. They represented the regions that this single mission had photographed, and people broke out in cheers. Some photos were fogged by electrostatic discharges, but the resolution was 20 to 30 feet, which analysts described as \\"good to very good. \\" Cuban Missile Crisis U-2 photographs taken on October 14, 1962, in which analysts, under Lundahl's direction, found visual evidence of the placement of Soviet SS-4 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM), capable of hitting targets, in the continental United States, with nuclear warheads. This triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis, sending the US intelligence community into maximum effort and triggering an unprecedented military alert. His briefing of John F. Kennedy, on October 16, confirmed the Soviet weapons' presence, which had not been expected by the intelligence community or military . Lundahl began the briefing, with assistance from Acting Director of Central Intelligence whose voice is low and often difficult to hear. Lundahl introduced the technical expert on Soviet missiles, Sidney Graybeal (\\"our missile man\\"). Obviously concerned, the president then asks Graybeal when the missiles will be ready to fire. In the oral history interview , Brugioni said that since intelligence tended to be staid, Lundahl encouraged Brugioni, if there was anything at all funny, to put it into the briefing package, so Lundahl could leave Kennedy smiling. Kennedy was known to dislike military jargon, and became annoyed with being told \\"the number of sites that were occupied, meaning each MRBM site had four pads and if there was a launcher on the pad, we'd say that that pad was occupied, meaning that a missile could be fired from that particular pad within four to six hours.\\" He detested that and he got after McCone and he said, there ought to be a better way of telling me this. So, the crisis was over ... the day after the crisis was over, one of our low altitude planes happened to fly over a military latrine and the military latrines are open at the top and ... so I made the briefing broad and Mr. Lundahl gave it to Mr. McCone. By this time, now Kennedy was four ... he knew that four pads and Mr. McCone said, Mr. President, he said, we have a new site in Cuba with three positions, with one position occupied and the President's jaw dropped and he looked at the photograph and of course, having served in the Pacific, and he saw what the site was. And he started laughing and he said, now I understand what occupied, unoccupied is, why didn't I have this primer earlier? So that even in the crisis period, there were humorous things. \\"And one of the things that was very impressive to me was that the photography was driving the crisis. In fact policy papers that were told to be prepared, were coming maybe one day or two days later and by that time, the situation had completely changed. So ... the photography was creating a climate that was demanding that policy stay right with the photography. Now keep in mind, we were on two twelve hour shifts, but the policy-makers were only working eight to ten hours a day. So Lundahl raised the issue, maybe the policy-maker ought to be going into twelve hour shifts and then stay right with us at the centre as we were looking at the photography. Now that never occurred, but Lundahl raised the issue and later that would come up several times in crises in the future in which people did move into the centre.\\" Principally as a result of the photographic information and the diplomatic discussions that resulted from the knowledge, Kennedy pressured the Soviets to take back the missiles. Lundahl received a personal commendation from President Kennedy and NPIC received a Presidential Unit Citation. Continued Development of Satellite Photography After receiving a report from the Panel for Future Satellite Reconnaissance Operations, whose members included Edward Purcell, the chairman, Richard Garwin, Edwin Land, and NPIC director Arthur Lundahl, the CIA Directorate of Science and Technology directed Itek Corporation to stop work on the M-2 followon to the CORONA satellite and concentrate on improving CORONA. During those committee briefings, Lundahl covered the relationship between the resolution of an image and a photo interpreter's ability to extract intelligence from the photo. There was no difference, the CIA's chief photo interpreter told them, in the intelligence that could be derived from photographs with 10-foot resolution than those with 5-foot resolution. The Purcell group concluded that development of a new search system, with resolution between 4 and 6 feet was not justified. Retirement and Afterwards On the occasion of his retirement in June 1973 he received the National Security Medal, the highest honor of the US intelligence community, authorized by the President for \\"distinguished achievement or outstanding contribution in the field of intelligence relating to the national security.\\" Lundal was succeeded by John J. Hicks as director of NPIC.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP76B00734R000100080035-5.pdf He also received the CIA's Distinguished Intelligence Medal, and the DIA Director's Award for Exceptional Civilian Service. He was inducted into the Order of the British Empire, with rank of Honorary Knight Commander, on 17 December 1974. He was also a past president of the American Society of Photogrammetry. Lundahl died at the Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland on June 22, 1992, at the age of 77. He reportedly died of respiratory failure.

The period began with the preemptive coup of 12 March 1934, which Prime Minister Konstantin P√§ts carried out to avert a feared takeover of the state apparatus by the Vaps Movement (League of Veterans). The term \\"Era of Silence\\" was introduced by Kaarel Eenpalu, Prime Minister in 1938‚Äì39 and a strong supporter of P√§ts, Estonia's President during that period. Context In the charged atmosphere that pervaded Europe in 1934, when Adolf Hitler had become a widely admired populist model for authoritarian nationalists, the Estonian elites viewed the threat of takeover by similar groups such as the Vaps movement as credible and imminent. P√§ts, using the authority of the newly adopted Constitution of 1933, proclaimed martial law on March 12. He appointed his trusted colleague Johan Laidoner, hero of the War of Independence but an opponent of the Vaps' leadership, as commander of the armed forces. Events Veterans' organisations were shut down, over 400 of the organisations' members were arrested, and all organised political activity in the country was outlawed. All Vaps members were also purged from local governments, the civil service, and the Defence League. These actions were immediately approved by the lame-duck parliament. However, when P√§ts decreed postponement of the elections for both State Elder and Parliament, scheduled to be held in spring 1934 according to the new constitution, opposition arose in a special session convened by the existing parliament, since the constitution did not allow postponement of elections by decree. In response, he permanently postponed the session and ruled by decree until a new constitution could be drawn up and adopted. Thus, P√§ts' takeover of the government was a coup de facto but also de jure, since the entire process was illegal under the constitution in effect in 1934. Other uses of term The phrase \\"Era of Silence\\" describes the silencing of all opposition to P√§ts' governing circle. However, it also reflects an apparent \\"national conspiracy\\" to go along with the suppression of civil and political rights in the interests of \\"order\\" after a decade of political turmoil. His rule was not an unduly harsh one: nearly all of those jailed in 1934 were released in 1938, and none of the former heads of state (Ants Piip, Juhan Kukk, Jaan Teemant and Jaan T√µnisson) who issued the Four State Elders' Memorandum in a Finnish newspaper in October 1936, calling on P√§ts to immediately end the curtailment of civil and political rights and to reinstitute democratic government, were ever harassed by the government. When elections were held in 1938 under the new constitution of 1937, the opposition gathered more votes than the government, but only managed to secure 16 seats to the government's 64. End of era The era ended either with the elections of 1938, or with the Soviet occupation in 1940. Further reading *Frucht, R. C. (2005).

World Toured Shows (1906‚Äì09), owned by Martin Downs. Cole Bros. World Toured Shows was not associated with the current Cole Bros. Circus or Clyde Beatty Cole Bros. except by name. Formation Shortly after the 1909 season Martin Downs was kicked by a horse and later died, and his show was put on the auction block in early 1910 by Fiss, Doer, and Carroll, New York horse dealers. The Billboard reported that 47 circus men attended the sale, all major shows being represented with the exception of Gollmar Bros. Largest buyer was J. Augustus Jones, who got a ticket wagon, calliope, bandwagons, chariots, cages, three tableaux, railroad cars, baggage stock. Other buyers were 101 Ranch, Ringling, Josie DeMott, Bartell Animal Co., Danny Robinson, Frank A. Robbins, Fred Buchanan, Andrew Downie, and Al F. Wheeler etc. W. E. Franklin and Walter L. Main were there but didn't buy anything. In 1910 J. Augustus Jones operated the \\"Jones Bros. Buffalo Ranch Wild West Show\\", a 14 car railroad show that traveled on 1 advance, 3 stock, 6 flats, and 4 coaches. After just one season Jones proceeded to sell his show. The December 10, 1910 Billboard reported that Thomas Wiedemann had purchased from Jones at Pulaski, Tennessee on November 12, some 29 horses, cars, wagons etc. and these were shipped to Wiedemann's quarters at Harrisburg, Illinois. The January 7, 1911 Billboard further reported that Jones had now sold all of his show except two sleepers, the equipment having been purchased by Downie & Wheeler, Masterson Shows, and Thomas Wiedemann. In 1911 Wiedemann used this equipment to start a Wild West Show called \\"Kit Carson Buffalo Ranch Wild West Show\\". This was actually a combination circus and wild west show, and the performance was presented in a tent rather than the usual canvas canopy and open air arena type performance used by most wild west shows. The Kit Carson show had many circus-type acts. For 1911 one train inventory shows a total of 12 cars, 1 advance, 3 stocks, 5 flats, and 3 coaches. Another shows 14 cars, 1 advance, 3 stocks, 6 flats, and 4 coaches. (Both may be right, as it's possible the show enlarged entour.) In 1912 the Kit Carson show was on 17 cars, 1 advance car, 5 stocks, 5 coaches, and 6 flats. After the 1913 season the show didn't go back to Harrisburg, Ill. quarters but wintered in Birmingham, Alabama, and opened the 1914 season in the South. Closure The Kit Carson show had the reputation of being a rough and tumble grift outfit, with plenty of \\"hey rubes\\" fights when the grifters were working. Some sources say that the strong grift was what finally closed the show. On Friday, October 23, 1914 at Harlan, Kentucky, the show was shot out of town by irate locals, and the next day, Oct. 24 at Barboursville, Kentucky the show halted. Creditors had stepped into the picture, closed the show, and had a flyer shipped to the U. S. Printing & Litho. Co. plant at Cincinnati, Ohio where it was advertised for auction. The stock was sold in December 1911, and March 20, 1915 was the time set for the sale of other properties at Cincinnati, except 5 cars and 12 wagons that were still stored at Harrisburg, but these were to be sold by description at the auction. The Kit Carson property at the sale went for very low prices. The Billboard states that the Dodson Carnival got the calliope (which may have been the instrument only) pole wagon, stage coach, 4 baggage wagons, blacksmith wagon, two tableaux, 1 stringer wagon, and a bandwagon. J. A. Jones, Harry Hill (Wild West), and Rice & Dore got other equipment. The report also goes on to say that \\"outsiders\\" got among other things, the ticket wagon, and one tableaux wagon.

Volunteers clean the alleyways of San Francisco's Chinatown, organize monthly programs for seniors and children, and provide tours with Chinatown Alleyway Tours.  History  This project started in 1991 when Reverend Norman Fong, a member of the Chinatown Community Development Center and a Chinatown advocate, recruited high school youth from Galileo High School to help him on his quest to beautify the alleyways in San Francisco's Chinatown. Back in the 1980s, the City of San Francisco did not officially recognize alleyways as city streets, so nothing was done to maintain them, leading to excessive amounts of graffiti and trash in those areas. For this reason, he decided to start the project. As of 2007, alleyways are still not considered to be streets because they do not meet the 32 ft width requirement, although other alleyways outside of Chinatown are. As of 2007, there are about 30+ members in the youth empowerment program, and 10 paid workers.  Volunteer life  Adopt-an-Alleyway (AAA) consists of volunteers (general and cabinet members) and coordinator(s). Monthly general meetings are held on the first Friday of each month, where all the volunteers come together to discuss and review upcoming events for that month. The cabinet will have their own meeting every second Friday of each month, supervised by the coordinator, to plan activities and organize events. The cabinet is composed of a president, vice president, two secretaries, four social chairs, and three to five cabinet leaders. The events/volunteer services done by the organization include: \\"Tenant Services,\\" \\"Super Sunday,\\" and clean-up/graffiti removal. \\"Tenant Services\\" is done twice a month, where the youths go to single room occupancies around San Francisco's Chinatown and interact with the seniors who live there, bridging the intergeneration gap. \\"Super Sunday\\" is an event where the youth take care of kids while their parents are having SRO meetings at Gordon J. Lau Elementary School. Clean-up/graffiti removal is where the youth break into groups, led by the cabinet, to sweep or paint over the graffiti of the alleyways of San Francisco's Chinatown.  Awards  On May 12, 2007, The project won the 2007 Crissy Field Heroes award and has a video spot at the Crissy Field Information Center.AAA Community Heroes As part of the project, the AAA also offers tours of Chinatown's alleyways, beginning at Portsmouth Square.Tour Guides = List of Chinatown Alleyways in English and Chinese= *Commercial Street - Ë•üÁæéÊÖéË°ó *Wentworth Street - Âæ∑ÂíåË°ó *Beckett Street - ÁôΩË©±ËΩâË°ó *Waverly Place - Â§©ÂêéÂªüË°ó *Ross Alley - ËàäÂëÇÂÆãÂ∑∑ *Walter U.

Born to a Hindu khatri family which traces its roots to Raja Todar Mal, Pershad studied at a western school under the patronage of Salar Jung I. He was a childhood friend of the Nizam and was a staunch Nizam loyalist throughout his life. In 1892, Pershad became the peshkar (deputy minister) of the state. Nine years later, Nizam Mahbub Ali Khan appointed him dewan (prime minister) of the state. During his first tenure as dewan, he was credited with increasing the state's revenue and helping victims of the Great Musi Flood of 1908. In 1926, he was reappointed as dewan. During this period, he passed the Mulki regulations, which favoured local citizens over British for administrative positions. A proponent of the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb (culture of the central plains of Northern India), Pershad also wrote Urdu and Persian poems which were influenced by Sufism. He was a patron of poetry, paintings and music. He had seven wives including both Hindus and Muslims. Early life Although Pershad was born in 1864, his exact date of birth is unrecorded. He claimed to have been \\"born two years before his highness [ Mir Osman Ali Khan ]\\". Pershad was a direct descendant of Raja Todar Mal, the finance minister of Mughal emperor Akbar. Pershad's ancestor, Rai Mull Chand, migrated from Delhi to Hyderabad with Asaf Jah I. His grandfather Narinder Pershad served as dewan and peshkar (deputy minister) during the reign of Mahbub Ali Khan. They were Hindu by faith and belonged to the khatri caste and the suryavanshi family. In his youth, Pershad was disinherited by his grandfather Narinder Pershad in favour of his younger brother. Subsequently, he was patronised by Salar Jung I and was educated along with his sons in a western school. Pershad studied accountancy, medicine, religion, astrology and sufism. Besides these, he learned martial arts, Mughal etiquette and court grooming at his school. Pershad studied the Sanskrit language because of his Hindu faith and accountancy because he had the hereditary charge of the royal treasury. Political career In 1892, Pershad was appointed peshkar of Hyderabad, and dewan in 1902. During this ten-year period he played an insignificant role in the administration of the state. He became the military minister in the nizams cabinet. He also fulfilled his responsibilities as a peshkar, which included him constantly attending to the Nizam to help him complete the formalities of state. In 1901, the Nizam appointed Pershad as dewan of Hyderabad and dismissed Viqar-ul-Umra. He was also conferred with the title \\"Yamin us Saltanat\\" (English: right hand of the realm) and his status was raised from that of a raja to a maharaja. In an attempt to improve the economic conditions of the state, he decreased the mansabdars (landowners) income. He also increased revenues from agriculture, railways, and customs. In 1908, a flood occurred in the state when the Musi River overflowed killing people and destroying property. In response, Pershad arranged for aid and made a personal donation to the victims. He paid salaries in advance and waived debts. During Pershad's first tenure as the dewan of Hyderabad, the state's cash reserves quadrupled. Although British historians credit the finance minister Casson Walker, a Briton, for this achievement, Hyderabadi tradition gives credit to Pershad. He also maintained a friendly relationship with the British resident. After Nizam Mahbub Ali Khan's death in 1911, Osman Ali Khan ascended the throne. Under his reign, Pershad found it difficult to continue as the dewan and resigned in 1912. In November 1926, he was reappointed to that position and continued until March 1937. During his second tenure, friction occurred between Pershad and Walker over political appointments. While Walker was in favour of appointing Britons to administrative positions, Pershad was in favour of appointing Mulkies (local citizens). Panic spread amongst the locals because of Walker's preference. They thought that no post, of even moderate or lesser importance, would be available to them. The clash between Pershad and Walker over this matter was continuous and all government departments were affected by it. Pershad passed the Mulki regulations according to which an \\"outsider\\" could not be appointed to any position if a suitably-qualified Mulki was available for the job; their educational qualifications were to be given more weight than their family background and retirement was fixed at fifty-five years of age. Personal life =Marriages= (From left to right): Pershad's grandson Raja Ratan Gopal Saincher, his daughter Rani Sultan Kunwar Bibi and Kishen Pershad Pershad with his children, c.1935 Pershad had seven wives. Three were Hindus of Brahmin caste and four were Muslims (which also included Shia Muslims). His Muslim wives bore him six sons; his Hindu wives bore him nine sons. The wives followed their own religion and the children were brought up in the religion of their mother. The children from Muslim wives had Islamic names; the children from Hindu wives had Hindu names. One of Pershad's favourite wives was Ghousia Begum. She belonged to an orthodox Muslim family. Although she lived under a strict purdah, they managed to court each other using disguises. According to Islamic law, marriage between a Muslim and a Hindu is not allowed. To marry her, he was ready to convert to Islam. However, Nizam Mahboob Ali Khan was not in favour of him converting as he did not want a Muslim peshkar. =Interests and beliefs= Pershad wrote Persian and Urdu poems under the pen name \\"Shad\\" (English: happy). His poetry was influenced by Sufism. He was also a proponent of Ganga- Jamuni tehzeeb (communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims). He wrote Pershad was a patron of poetry, paintings and music. No matter the quality of their work, he encouraged painters, writers and musicians. In the early morning, artists from different parts of India as well as from Persia and Arab countries visited him. He also published an Urdu poetry magazine titled Mahbub Al Kalam. In it the first ghazal was written by Nizam Mahbub Ali Khan, the rest were written by Pershad. The ghazals were written in the form a dialogue between two lovers. Pershad's hobbies included painting, playing sitar, photography and sculpting. He was a childhood friend of the Nizam and throughout his life, he was a staunch Nizam loyalist. The Times of India wrote the following about him: > His charismatic personality and legendary largesse endeared him with the > masses. His eminence as the supreme personification of all that was good in > erstwhile Hyderabad has ensured that 'Maharaja' implies none other than > Kishen Pershad. =Image and character= Despite the fact that Hyderabadi society was feudal in nature and Pershad belonged to an upper caste, during his reign as a minister, his associates consisted of people of every caste and class. According to his family members, he would sit with a beggar on his sofa in his drawing room and would serve him tea. When he was criticised for his acts, he replied, \\"Do not despise anyone. You never know, it may be God himself who visits you in the guise of a beggar\\". Due to his contacts, Pershad was able to understand the sentiments of all sections of society. Even after becoming the prime minister of Hyderabad, he continued his participation in public functions like the inauguration of schools and clinics, and continued to appear as a chief guest in the circus. During the marriage season, he also attended marriages of the common public including the poor when he was invited. =Knighthood= Pershad was conferred with the KCIE in January 1903 and the GCIE in 1910. Death Pershad died at Hyderabad on 13 May 1940. Upon his death, Nizam Osman Ali Khan said \\"society has witnessed the departure of the last vestige of the Mughal empire\\".

During his life he was a member and leader in several different denominations of the Latter Day Saint Movement, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the New Movement (Godbeite) movement, and the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). He played a significant role in the creation of the Salt Lake Tribune. Towards his death, Tullidge was respected even within the LDS Church community for his fair portrayals in his histories. He was a strong advocate for women's suffrage. Historian Claudia Bushman wrote that Tullidge \\"stood alone as a Mormon feminist historian before the revitalization of the women's movement in the 1970s.\\" Biography =Early Life in England= Tullidge was born at Weymouth, Dorset, England as Edward William Tullidge. He was born into a middle class Methodist home, and apprenticed as a coach builder and painter.Claudia Bushman, \\"Edward W. Tullidge and The Women of Mormondom\\" Dialouge Journal V33, No. 4 https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp- content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V33N04_25.pdf His father was John E. Tullidge, who became a noted early musician in the state of Utah.William Frank Lye, \\"Edward Wheelock Tullidge, the Mormons' Rebel Historian,\\" Utah Historical Quarterly 28, no. 1 (January 1960): 56-75. Online at:https://issuu.com/utah10/docs/uhq_volume28_1960_number1/60 At the age of 17 he became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints He spent twelve years doing missionary work for his church in Great Britain, mending shoes for money, and writing articles for the Millennial Star. Among those who he would walk to church with at this time was the later Latter-day Saint poet Emily Hill Woodmansee. In 1852, Tullidge briefly renounced his beliefs in Mormonism and joined a deist society, even requesting his name be removed from Church records, but soon returned to Mormonism. In 1856, the President of the mission, Franklin D. Richards, took note of Tullidge's articles and called him from proselytizing to work in the Liverpool editorial office of the Millennial Star under the incoming president, Orson Pratt. While in Liverpool, he felt a calling to move to Utah and write a biography of Joseph Smith. =Emigration to Utah= Tullidge emigrated to Utah Territory in 1861. He approached Brigham Young enthusiastically with ideas for improving the literary quality of Utah but was disappointingly met with little encouragement or response.Walker, R. (1976). Edward Tullidge: Historian of the Mormon Commonwealth. Journal of Mormon History, 3, 55-72. Retrieved May 25, 2020, from www.jstor.org/stable/23286158 He approached Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith and received permission to use their journals for his planned biography of Smith. Tullidge had been impressed with a story he heard from Orson Hyde, telling of heavenly voices accompanying the appointment of Brigham Young to the first presidency of the LDS Church. He was troubled by the lack of evidence in the journals for this event and after discussion with Woodruff, became convinced this claim was false. On November 15, 1862, he was called as a president of the sixty-fifth Quorum of the Seventy. In October 1864, he began publishing a literary magazine with his friend Elias L. T. Harrison called Peep O'Day, the first to be published west of the Missouri. A purpose of the magazine was to push the church away from perceived theocracy, and create a new culture led by the example of Mormonism.Benjamin E. Park, \\"The Theology of a Career Convert: Edward Tullidge's Evolving Identities\\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought , Fall 2012, Vol. 45, No. 3 (Fall 2012), pp. 38-50 Published by: University of Illinois Press Stable URL: http://www.jstor.com/stable/10.5406/dialjmormthou.45.3.0038 Editorials by Tulidge were criticized by Brigham Young, increasing Tullidge's disgruntlement with what he felt was Young's autocratic style. In a time when animosity between Mormons and non-Mormons was increasing, the magazine advocating for unity was not popular and did not last for a full year, running through just five issues. The failure of his magazine and pressure to produce sent him into a depression and heavy drinking, that in the words of Tullidge, \\"nearly sent me to the grave\\". He was living with Wilford Woodruff at the time, and received several healing blessings from Woodruff. Upon what he felt was a miraculous recovery from an illness in 1866, he went east, and wrote for a New York Magazine called the Galaxy for the next two years. His articles were frequently about Mormonism, portraying them in a positive light and attempting to bridge the cultural divide between Mormons and the rest of the United States. Orson Pratt visited him on his way back from his English mission. In 1867, Tullidge embarked on a four month mission to several eastern cities. On his 1868 journey back to the territory of Utah, he stopped on the way to visit Emma Smith, the widow of Joseph Smith. He came away convinced she was in error, but also sympathetic, promising himself that he would never write about her disrespectfully. Portrait of Edward Tullidge =Godbeite Movement= Upon returning to the Utah territory, he became friends with the future leaders of the Godbeite movement, including William S. Godbe. Tullidge and Elias Harrison were patronized by Godbe, and started a new magazine called the Utah Magazine. When Harrison and Godbe went to New York for a rest, Tullidge continued on alone with the magazine. While in New York, Godbe and Harrison said they received audible revelations convincing them that the LDS Church had gone astray under Brigham Young, neglected spiritual duties and focused too much on worldly kingdom building. When Godbe and Harrison returned to Utah, they formed a revolt against some of the secular policies of Young. Tullidge for his part had been somewhat supportive of Young's economic policies, and had developed a friendly relationship with Young, but joined his friends in the revolt and wrote a history of world figures that differed from Mormonism's historical view.Walker, Ronald W. Wayward Saints: the Social and Religious Protests of the Godbeites against Brigham Young. Brigham Young University Press, 2009. When the seven of the writers of the Utah Magazine were arraigned for a church disciplinary action, Young personally intervened and dismissed the charges against only Tullidge. At the trial of Godbe and Harrison, Tullidge plead with them to reconcile rather than be excommunicated, stating \\"My own heart never yearned so much towards Brigham as on the trial in question,\\" and that Young was \\"the great man who has so long been to us in the position of a father.\\" Godbe and Harrison did not reconcile, and were excommunicated for apostasy. Tullidge resigned his membership in solidarity in an open letter to Brigham Young, writing \\"For years I have tried to shun the issues of this day ... for theoretically I have been a believer in republican institutions and not in a temporal theocracy.\\" The Utah Magazine changed into a newspaper, called The Mormon Tribune, and eventually renamed The Salt Lake Tribune. Tullidge became an influential proponent of the New Movement, particularly in the eastern United States press. The Godbeite's formed a new church, called the \\"Church of Zion\\", and within this church Tullidge was appointed as a President of the First Council of the Seventy and a member of the Salt Lake Stake Presidency. During these years Tullidge wrote disparagingly of Young, to the point that years later he wrote Young an apology for his words. Tullidge participated outwardly in religious organizations but at this time had \\"an unbelief of eight years\\", that he had a \\"philosophical state of religion\\" and did not accept \\"the mission of any special prophet.\\" By the early 1870s, Tullidge's began to participate less in the New Movement. Godbe and Harrison increasingly began to embrace Spiritualism, which Tullidge did not agree with, publicly accusing Godbe and Harrison of betraying the original principles of the movement. Tullidge turned his focus on other projects, including a play on the life of Oliver Cromwell, and went East to promote it. In 1871 he returned to Utah and became an associate editor of what was now the Salt Lake Tribune. Tullidge still hoped the Godbeites and Brighamites factions could be reconciled, but as the Tribune became more oppositional, Tullidge lost his editorship in 1873. Tullidge began to write a series of biographies, his first one on Brigham Young. Although Tullidge self identified as an apostate, he reconciled with his earlier Church. Young wrote that Tullidge \\"had suffered enough\\" and gave him access to historical materials. His book \\"Life of Brigham Young: or, Utah and Her Founders\\" was published in 1876. This was followed by \\"Women of Mormondom\\" in 1877, which included biographies of prominent Mormon women, and advocated for women's suffrage. =Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints= In 1878 Tullidge published \\"The Life of Joseph the Prophet\\".Edward Tullidge, \\"Life of Joseph the Prophet\\", online at: https://archive.org/details/lifeofjosephprop00byu2tull Young had died in 1877, and the new leader of the LDS Church John Taylor was not as sympathetic towards Tullidge. The book gave credit to Joseph F. Smith and Eliza R. Snow for their help reading and revising the manuscript, and Taylor thought it was an opportunistic subterfuge to imply LDS Church sanction of the book. Taylor issued a statement discouraging members from buying the book. Joseph Smith III, the leader of Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) and son of Joseph Smith, wrote to Tullidge expressing his approval of the biography.Joseph Smith and Heman C. Smith \\"History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\", Independence Missouri:Herald House, 1967. 4:282, 287 Tullidge traveled to Missouri and in late 1879 became a member of the RLDS Church. He was ordained an elder, acted as a clerk at general conference, preached in congregations and became the RLDS Historian. He revised his biography of Joseph Smith, adding sections denying polygamy, inferences that Brigham Young was not the rightful successor to Smith, and other expansions on RLDS Church history.Edward Tullidge \\"Life of Joseph the Prophet\\" Board of Publication of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 1880 online at: https://archive.org/details/lifeofjosephprop01tull/page/n11/mode/2up The biography was published by the RLDS Church and became its history up to that time. During this time, Tullidge wrote a letter to the President of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes asking him to appoint Joseph Smith III as governor of Utah, a move that he said would destroy, \\"Polygamic Theocracy.\\" =Return to Utah= The RLDS Church called Tullidge on a mission to Utah in October 1879. Perhaps surprisingly to him, Tullidge was welcomed back by the population of Utah, and his devotion to the RLDS Church fizzled. He was commissioned by leading members of the LDS Church to write an important \\"History of Salt Lake City\\", published a new magazine \\"Tullidge's Quarterly Magazine\\", and in 1889 a history of the intermountain west. It was a difficult time in the state of Utah, and several of these ventures were not financially successful. With a house facing foreclosure, and a possible bankruptcy, he wrote several letters to Wilford Woodruff, begging for assistance. The LDS Church responded by buying fifty copies of his Salt Lake City history, and fifty more copies of his intermountain west history. There is evidence that other assistance was also provided. Tullidge's alcoholism increased and at the age of 65, on May 22, 1894 he died. Marriage and Family Tullidge had two polygamous marriages that both ended in divorce. The first was to his cousin Jane Bowring, who Tullidge said he married out of \\"love of family and Mormons.\\" His second marriage was to Eliza Kingsford Bowring, ten years older than him, the widow of his cousin and friend of his mother, possibly to provide her a home. His final marriage to Susannah Ferguson produced ten children, five of whom survived infancy. Ferguson became poverty stricken after the death of Tullidge, and eight years after his death, she committed suicide, her body found in a tent with frayed blankets and little to protect her from the cold ground.

He then relocated to Sydney and in 1949 went to work for trainer Tommy J. Smith (also known as T.J. Smith) with whom he would have considerable success. In 1950, at the invitation of Johnny Longden, Moore traveled to the United States where he won the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack.Deeds left them yelling for Moore In 1957 and 1958 George Moore won the Jockeys' Premiership at Sydney then in 1959 accepted an offer to ride in Europe for trainer/owner Alec Head of Haras du Quesnay and another major owner, Prince Aly Khan. There, he won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, as well as a British Classic Race, the 2,000 Guineas. Returning to Sydney, Moore continued to win Jockeys' Premierships and in 1967 returned for a time to compete in Europe for trainer Noel Murless where he won the first three 1967 British Classics, the 1,000 Guineas, a second 2,000 Guineas, and his biggest win of all in British racing, the 1967 Epsom Derby. In Australia, George Moore won numerous of the country's top races and was the jockey aboard Tulloch for nineteen of the Hall of Fame horse's thirty-six wins. He retired from riding in 1971 having won 312 metropolitan stakes and a record 119 Group One races. He then turned his talents to training, first in France, then in Australia and for thirteen seasons in Hong Kong where, between 1973 and 1985, he won the training premiership eleven times. After the 1985 racing season George Moore retired to the Gold Coast. He died in Sydney on 8 January 2008.Champion jockey Moore dies Honours Moore was one of the most honoured men in Australian Thoroughbred racing history. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1972It's an Honour: OBE and in 1986 was inducted into the newly created Sport Australia Hall of Fame. In December 1998, Sydney Racing authorities created the George Moore Medal, to be given annually to the most outstanding jockey competing in Sydney. In 2000 he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal \\"for outstanding commitment to Thoroughbred Racing\\".It's an Honour: Australian Sports Medal Moore was part of the 2001 inaugural class inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.

The most basic crop coefficient, Kc, is simply the ratio of ET observed for the crop studied over that observed for the well calibrated reference crop under the same conditions. PET = K_c * RET Potential evapotranspiration (PET), is the evaporation and transpiration that potentially could occur if a field of the crop had an ideal unlimited water supply. RET is the reference ET often denoted as ET0. Even in agricultural crops, where ideal conditions are approximated as much as is practical, plants are not always growing (and therefore transpiring) at their theoretical potential. Plants have growth stages and states of health induced by a variety of environmental conditions. RET usually represents the PET of the reference crop's most active growth. Kc then becomes a function or series of values specific to the crop of interest through its growing season. These can be quite elaborate in the case of certain maize varieties, but tend to use a trapezoidal or leaf area index (LAI) curve for common crop or vegetation canopies. Stress coefficients, Ks, account for diminished ET due to specific stress factors. These are often assumed to combine by multiplication. ET_{estimate} = K_w * K_{s_1} * K_{s_2} * K_c * ET_o Water stress is the most ubiquitous stress factor, often denoted as Kw. Stress coefficients tend to be functions ranging between 0 and 1. The simplest are linear, but thresholds are appropriate for some toxicity responses. Crop coefficients can exceed 1 when the crop evapotranspiration exceeds that of RET.

It is prepared by hot smoking a marinated duck over tea leaves and camphor leaves. Some cookbooks and authors have used leaves and twigs of the camphor plant in smoking due to the dish's name, but this is a misunderstanding. Due to its complicated preparation, Zhangcha duck was eaten more often at banquets or festive events than as a daily household dish. Preparation The duck is first marinated for several hours with a rub containing a typical combination of whole or crushed Sichuan pepper, huangjiu or baijiu (fermented or distilled Chinese wine), ginger, garlic, and salt, with much of it rubbed inside the cavity of the duck. For intensity of taste, sometimes the marinade rub is augmented with choujiu, black pepper, tea leaves, and camphor leaves. Following the marination, the duck is quickly blanched in hot water to tighten the skin, and then towel and air dried. This step ensures that the skin of the duck will not turn bitter during smoking. A wok is then prepared for smoking the duck with black tea leaves. Following a smoke treatment of approximately 10‚Äì15 minutes, the duck is then steamed for another 10 minutes before being deep fried in vegetable oil until its skin is crisp.

It was hosted by Jesse Brown, who also co-produced the show with Geoff Siskind and Andrew Parker. Cory Doctorow, novelist and editor of Boing Boing, was also a regular contributor. The program explored the effects of the Internet on politics and culture. The show has focused on stories involving copyright, video games, and China, as well as the social impact and technology surrounding them.  Overview  Search Engine first aired on September 6, 2007. It discussed Internet phenomena. Unlike other shows, however, Search Engine concentrates on ways in which the Internet influences other aspects of life and culture. Though much of the subject matter he deals with is serious, Brown generally takes a lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek approach to his material. Originally every episode began with a set of keywords - teaser phrases that summarize the major stories for that episode. The term \\"keyword\\" ties into the name of the show as something a search engine uses to categorize things of importance. Other Internet terms were regularly invoked and adapted to the purpose of attempting to describe unusual or unprecedented technology- related cultural phenomena. The program ran for one half-hour. Usually there were three in-depth stories, each of which was separated by a clip of Creative Commons licensed music. Other, smaller topics were occasionally interspersed. Often these consisted of updates on past stories, or addresses to the listeners about the show itself. In keeping with an open source theme, the creators of Search Engine utilized the show's online blog to communicate and collaborate with listeners. The radio stories feed off of opinions or information gleaned from listener commentary. Follow-up pieces are at times justified by direct listener response. Additionally, listeners are often openly encouraged on the air to contribute to the betterment of specific aspects of the show. The show had several occasional features that were periodically played: *The Best of Craigslist: Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster reading selected outlandish posts from his company's site. *Copyfight: Digital rights columnist Cory Doctorow commentary on controversies springing from issues with Internet copyright law. *Flipback: A segment that showcases recordings resurrected from the Internet Archive. *Another recurring topic investigated on Search Engine is the Internet Bill of Rights, a set of universal standards concerning online liberties drafted and spearheaded by the Internet Governance Forum. Original Search Engine Logo This logo, created by Nick Csernack, was used by Search Engine  Program History  The program aired on Thursdays at 11:30 a.m.(12:00 NT), and was repeated on Tuesdays at 3:30 p.m.(4:00 NT, select markets) on stations which did not air extended CBC Radio One local programs. In June 2008, the series was canceled as a separate program on the schedule. In the 2008-2009 season, Brown contributed Search Engine type material as a feature supplement to other CBC programming while producing a weekly stand alone audio podcast of the series along with its blog. Shortly after the announcement some fans of the show created a Facebook Group, ‚ÄúSaving CBC's Search Engine‚Äù to protest the cancellation of the radio show and reformatting of the podcast. After only a few weeks this group had well over 700 members. The Brown and the podcast's association with the CBC was terminated in the face of the corporation's budget cuts in the spring of 2009. As such, Jesse Brown announced on May 1, 2009 that his podcast would be hosted and supported by the Government of Ontario's public broadcasting network, TVOntario. The show ran for many years on TVOntario as a download only podcast. The final episode was on June 26, 2012.  Subjects of Focus  = Canadian Copyright = As well as in regular contributions from Cory Doctorow, Brown focused on the issues surrounding Canadian copyright. Originally mentioning it on one show, he soon realized that many listeners were interested in the issue.

He has also spoken about the lack of a Fair Use law in Canada and controversy surrounding the issue. = China = Since its inception, Search Engine has broadcast stories pertaining to government control of the Internet in China, commented on the citizen journalism efforts in that nation, and criticized the Chinese government for the ways in which its policies restrict access to many Internet venues. In early 2008, it was reported by a number of Search Engine listeners in China that the CBC had been rendered unavailable. The show's crew kept in contact with these listeners through message boards and its Facebook page, and confirmed that the blockage was limited to China and was therefore not a technical problem. Brown broke the story on the air, which prompted the president of the CBC to make an appeal to the Chinese Ambassador, calling for an end to the blockage. Soon after, the site was made available again in China. = The Internet and Identity = In January 2008, Search Engine began reporting on the controversy between the Internet group \\"Anonymous\\" and the Church of Scientology. Brown called Anonymous \\"clowns,\\" and invited them to call his bluff. He later had two members of the group on the show.

In 2003, Brown launched a magazine called Stu under the pseudonym Stuart Neihardt.

Biography LazƒÉr was born in Bucharest in 1938. She graduated from the Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography (where she also obtained a degree in psychology, which she practiced until 1994, dealing mainly in couples therapy) and subsequently played roles in Romanian theatre [notably a run of Right You Are (if you think so) in 1963-64]. She fled her home country to escape communism and eventually settled in Italy in 1965. She managed to learn the Italian language in only a few weeks and had planned to move on to the United States or Israel, but became entranced with Rome. There, she met and married Italian actor Adolfo Celi with whom she had two children, director Leonardo Celi and actress Alessandra Celi. She made her screen debut as Marlon Brando's deceased wife in Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris (1972), and also appeared in some of the director's subsequent films, La Luna (1979), The Sheltering Sky (1990), and Besieged (1998). LazƒÉr is probably best known internationally for her role as the demonic Mater Tenebrarum in Dario Argento's Inferno (1980), as well as the ill-fated Martha in Lucio Fulci's The Beyond (1981). She later appeared in Argento's The Stendhal Syndrome (1996) in a role that was removed from the North American version (though she is still billed in the end credits). Her other films included Michelangelo Antonioni's Identification of a Woman (1982), My Sister and I (1987), Towards Evening (1990), The Prince's Manuscript (2000) and Ginostra (2002). She had an extensive career in (mostly) Italian television, where she was often the lead or one of the lead characters. LazƒÉr headlined the 1978 adaptation of The Elective Affinities, Giacinta (1980) and was a big part of the 1989 BBC miniseries Summer's Lease. Her last role was that of the main character Lorenzo's loving grandmother in Bertolucci's Me and You (2012). Veronica LazƒÉr was a renowned woman of culture and a cultural ambassador between Italian and Romanian cinema (the latter, a position she began in 1989). She was a linguistic interpreter and was seen as a symbolic figure with a protective aura by her countrymen in both Italy and Romania. https://ilmanifesto.it/veronica-lazar-musa-di-grandi-maestri/ She was also president of the Itaro Art Foundation and was instrumental in its 2007 retrospective on Romanian cinema held in Rome and Pisa. She was heavily involved with the acting students at Teatro Valle and often would cook meals for the them at her home and bring them to the theatre. The students there nicknamed her \\"Nonna Veronica.\\" LazƒÉr also coordinated the construction of a hospital in Mali over the course of a year, on orders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When she returned to Italy, she brought with her African fabrics, statues, and carpets, many of which were still in her home when she died. LazƒÉr loved to play cards, share with her friends, and had a special affinity for the sea. At her funeral, she wanted her 18-year-old niece, a career musician already, to play the theme from Schindler's List throughout the Jewish cemetery in Prima Porta where she was laid to rest. https://www.donneuropa.it/cultura-e-spettacoli/2014/07/25/tutte-le-vite-di- veronica-lazar-attrice-icona-di-bertolucci-e-antonioni/ References External links * Category:1938 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Italian film actresses Category:Italian stage actresses Category:Italian television actresses Category:People from Bucharest Category:Romanian emigrants to Italy Category:Naturalised citizens of Italy ","title":"Veronica LazƒÉr"},{"id":"13885458","text":"\\"You See Me Crying\\" is a power ballad by American hard rock band Aerosmith. It was released in 1975 as the last track on the band's breakthrough album Toys in the Attic. A shorter mix of the song was released as the third single from the album in November 1975, but failed to chart. Consequently, the original single (backed with \\"Toys in the Attic\\") is rather rare. Song structure The song is a complex piano ballad and was heavily orchestrated. Aerosmith and producer Jack Douglas brought in a symphony orchestra for the song, which was conducted by Mike Mainieri. The song itself was written by lead singer Steven Tyler and outside collaborator Don Solomon. Some of the band members became frustrated with the song, which took a long time to complete, due to the many complex drum and guitar parts. The band's label, Columbia Records, was nonetheless very impressed with the song and the recording process. Bruce Lundvall, then-president of Columbia, walked in on the recording sessions for Toys when the band was working on the song and remarked: \\"You guys got an incredible thing going here. I just came from a Herbie Hancock session and this is much more fun\\".Douglas, S. and Aerosmith: \\"Walk This Way\\", page 234.

The final version of the song was taken from takes 12, 14, and 15, and the single version of the song was edited down to 3:00.Toys in the Attic 1993 Remastered Liner Notes It has only been performed live once, on June 26, 2009, while in Wantagh, New York's Jones Beach Theater, during the Aerosmith/ZZ Top Tour. While Aerosmith were planning the Back in the Saddle Tour and recording the Done with Mirrors album during 1984, Boston DJ Mark Parenteau of WBCN-FM played the song. Tyler liked the song so much, he suggested his group record a cover version, only to be told by Perry, \\"It's us, fuckhead.\\" Tyler was suffering from memory problems at the time due to heavy drug use.

In the 1980s, Czechoslovakia was Mongolia's second-largest trading partner, behind Russia. After the 1992 dissolution of Czechoslovakia, Mongolia reaffirmed its relations with the newly formed Czech Republic in 1993. The Czech Republic has an embassy in Ulaanbaatar. Both countries are members of the International Investment Bank (IIB) and formerly Comecon. History In the 1980s, Czechoslovakia was Mongolia's second- largest trading partner, behind USSR. After the 1992 dissolution of Czechoslovakia, Mongolia reaffirmed its relations with the newly formed Czech Republic in 1993. However, in the 1990s, trade volumes declined sharply, though the Czech Republic still accounts for about 1% of Mongolia's imports. The Embassy of the Czech Republic in Ulaanbaatar was formally reopened in 1999. As of 2005, annual bilateral trade between the two countries was valued at US$5 million. The Czech government has also been involved in various water supply development programs in Mongolia. In 2002, the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade developed plans to provide drinking water to Dundgovi Aimag through the development of a new water treatment plant at Mandalgovi. Then, in September 2007, the Czech Chamber of Commerce for East Asia signed a memorandum of cooperation agreeing to design and build new sewage processing plants for Ulaanbaatar. In terms of joint scientific expeditions looking for dinosaur fossils in Mongolia, the Mongolian side has also recently shown preference to Czech paleontologists over those from the United States, Germany, and Switzerland. Mongolian and Czech officials note a number of commonalities between the two countries which serve to cement their ties, such as their transitions to market-based economies and democratisation of previously communist-dominated governments. In 2012, the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade announced a new partnership to the value of around four billion Czech koruna involving the supply of infrastructure to Mongolia.

WSYB is home to the local talk show, \\"On the Air with Tim Philbin\\", which has been a strong local staple on WSYB since March 1995 and has been highlighted on national news and entertainment programs. WSYB also carries The Robert Wuhl Show, and Coast to Coast AM. WSYB's weekend lineup includes At Home with Gary Sullivan, Sports Talk with David Tibbs (with occasional co-host Jack Healy), Money Talk, and Handel On The Law. WSYB is also one of the first stations to broadcast Boston Red Sox baseball, and continues to be one of their longest running affiliates. WSYB has remained both viable and stable throughout many ownership and management changes. WSYB is also well known for the \\"all-important weekend weather forecasts\\" by Tim Filben History The station signed on the air on December 10, 1930.Broadcasting Yearbook 1949 page 269 It is the second oldest radio station in Vermont, after WVMT Burlington.

The station broadcast on 1500 kc. at 100 watts in 19351935 Broadcasting Yearbook, page 60 and finally settled on its current frequency in the mid-1940s. The WSYB call sign stands for, \\"We Serve You Best\\". Since the demise of WHWB in the early 1990s, WSYB remains the only AM radio station serving the local Rutland area. WSYB is home to the long based charity, \\"The WSYB Christmas Fund\\", which has been serving needy families in the Rutland community since the early 1970s. WSYB broadcasts with a 5 kW omnidirectional signal with one tower from local sunrise to local sunset. At night, WSYB utilizes two towers with 1 kW and a pattern that is aimed mainly northeast of the transmitter site. While the daytime signal provides ample coverage for Rutland County, the nighttime signal does miss most of the county south and west of the transmitter site. On the other hand, with the night time signal aimed to the northeast, there have been numerous reception reports from very enthusiastic listeners in the Canadian Maritimes, England, and even Finland over the years. Some of the owners for WSYB over the years have included Vermont Radio Inc, All Communications Inc., H & D Media, Excalibur Media, and Clear Channel Communications. WSYB, its FM sister WZRT, and several other Clear Channel properties were swapped out to Pamal Broadcasting in exchange for WRNX in Northampton, Massachusetts.

He is also called Shield Jaguar II by modern writers and commonly referred to simply as Shield Jaguar based on his name glyph before the phonetic name was deciphered. Family Itzamnaaj B ºalam was born in 647 to Lady Pacal and Yaxun B ºalam III and later had a son named Yaxun B ºalam IV who ascended to the throne after Itzamnaaj B ºalam's death. His grandmother was Lady Xibalba, noblewoman of Yaxchilan. Early life Little is known of Itzamnaaj B ºalam's early life except that when he was eleven years old one of his siblings participated in a war that involved Pacal, the famous king of Palenque. Accession and reign In order to become king, Itzamnaaj B ºalam defeated Ah Ahaual (a Mayan noble) in war and took him captive to Yaxchilan. At the age of 34 around October 23, 681, he became king of Yaxchilan. He was married to his aunt, Lady Xoc, and she held a great amount of power. One of Itzamnaaj B ºalam's greatest accomplishments was the construction of what is now called Temple 23. At Temple 23, Lady Xoc is shown performing a bloodletting ritual for three occasions: Itz ºamn√°j B ºalam's accession to the throne, the birth of Yaxun B ºalam, and the dedication of Temple 23. Preparing for an heir Itzamnaaj B ºalam had a second wife named Lady Eveningstar of Calakmul with whom he had a son named Yaxun B ºalam. He chose Yaxun B ºalam to be his successor despite the fact that Lady Xoc, his other wife, had a strategically important bloodline. It is believed by Linda Schele and David Freidel that Itzamnaaj B ºalam had Temple 23 in Yaxchilan constructed to honor Lady Xoc while also gaining public support for his son to become king. He also married Lady Sak B ºiyaan, but she was not of so high status as his aunt. End of the reign The majority of the buildings constructed during Itzamnaaj B ºalam's reign occurred in the last third of his life. He was still leading his troops to battle in his eighties.

The College is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, South Queensland District and is part of the Seventh-day Adventist Church's worldwide educational system. History Northpine Christian College has experienced many major changes since it first commenced with just 26 students in January 1940. It began in the hall at the back of the Albion Seventh-day Adventist Church in Brisbane. As enrolments grew, a small school was established at Zillmere in 1953. Fred Brown was the first school Head Master. In February 1978 a fire completely destroyed the school building at Zillmere. The cause of the fire was never ascertained, however, it was suspected to have started in the sports equipment room. The only item saved from the fire was the school bell, which remains on display in the front office of the current College administrative block. Mel Olsen was Head Master at the time, and, following the fire, for almost two years the school was then conducted in the 'sheds' of the Watson Park Seventh-day Adventist Convention Centre. In August 1980, the new school buildings were officially opened at the current site. The school continued as a primary school until January 1984, when the junior secondary school commenced. Since then, the College has continued to expand with the Resource Centre opening in July 1991 and the addition of Years 11 and 12 in 1996. In 2007, the College added a Childcare & Early Learning Centre, and in 2008 the Performing Arts centre was completed and soon after, a new classroom block. In 2019, a new building with an outdoor amphitheatre was opened to provide new classrooms for the growing high school. The College has a sister college, Noosa Christian College, at Cooroy, approximately one hour north of Dakabin. Spiritual aspects All students take religion classes each year that they are enrolled. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines sometimes begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input. Weekly, the entire student body gathers together for an hour-long chapel service. Outside the classrooms there is year-round spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement.

With 4,400 employees and an annual turnover of around euro 1, 6 billion euro (2008), Ferrostaal serves customers in more than 40 countries worldwide. Ferrostaal provides industrial services in two areas: Projects (Petrochemicals, Industrial Plants, Solar Energy and Power) and Services (Equipment, Piping, Automotive). In 2009, the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) of Abu Dhabi has taken over 70% of the shares of Ferrostaal AG from MAN AG, Munich. Due to the acquisition of the majority shares, the company entered the commercial register as Ferrostaal, underlining its separation from the MAN Group.http://www.ferrostaal.com/uploads/tx_mfsmatrix/MF_JB_08_Gb_sec.pdf History Ferrostaal was founded in The Hague, Netherlands in 1920. The steel trading company was bought by Gutehoffnungsh√ºtte Aktienverein (GHH) in 1926. Ferrostaal expanded into many countries and, from the 1950s onwards, committed itself to worldwide steel trade. During the 1960s the company started to build industrial plants. Until the end of the 1960s, Ferrostaal was also known as manufacturer of diesel railcars and railbuses. In 2004 it was renamed MAN Ferrostaal. Three years later the corporation sold two thirds of its steel business. In 2007 Solar and Biofuels were created as new strategic business areas. As a result of IPIC taking over the majority of shares of MAN Ferrostaal AG, the company changed its name into Ferrostaal AG. In March 2012, MAN SE announced the sale of Ferrostaal AG to the MPC Group. Since March 2012 Ferrostaal's new owner is MPC Industries GmbH and the company's name has been changed to Ferrostaal GmbH.

Perceval DoriaHis first name is also spelled Percival in English, Percivalle in Italian, and Perseval or Persival in Proven√ßal. (born c. 1195, died 1264) was a Genoese naval and military leader in the thirteenth century. A Ghibelline, he was a partisan of the Hohenstaufen in Italy and served the Emperor Frederick II and Manfred of Sicily as vicar of Romagna, the March of Ancona, and the Duchy of Spoleto.Siberry, 184. He was probably a member of the famous Doria family, whose name was originally D'Oria or da Otranto. Between 1228 and 1243 he assumed the character of a podest√† in several Proven√ßal and north Italian cities, such as Arles, Avignon, Asti, and Parma. In 1255 Manfred nominated him to the vicariate general of Ancona and in 1258 that of Romagna. With relations between Manfred and Pope Urban IV deteriorating, Doria was forced to put Spoleto to fire and the sword in 1259. Five years later, in 1264, he led a small army of Saracens and Germans against Charles of Anjou, who contested Manfred's throne. On the ensuing march he drowned in the river Nera di Narco near Arrone with his horse. Doria was also a troubadour of the Sicilian School, composing two cansos in Proven√ßal\\" Perceval Doria, Po√®te italien, √©crit en Langue Proven√ßale \\" in Ulysse Robert, _Histoire lit√©raire de la France ou l'on traite de l'origine et du progres, de la decadence_ , volume 9, 1750, p.177 and table of matters as well as two poems in Italian. In one poem, entitled Felon cor ai et enic (1258/9), he praised Manfred's bravery and magnanimity. His other Proven√ßal poem was a tenso, Per aquest cors, del teu trip, with Felip de Valenza.

It originally opened Feb. 15, 1913 to replace an 1894 swing-span bridge. The bridge connects downtown with the tideflats, it spans the Thea Foss Waterway, originally known as the City Waterway. Designed by noted bridge engineering firm Waddell & Harrington, the bridge has some unusual features: higher above the water than most lift bridges, construction on a variable grade and an overhead span designed to carry a water pipe. The bridge structure also contained a series of switchback ramps that connected what is now Cliff Street with Dock Street. According to the Department of Transportation, the towers are 207' 1\\" (63.14 m) above the water, with the road deck 60' above the water level at zero tide. It was modified and updated in 1957 and was used to route State Route 509 through the tideflats. The bridge was bypassed in the late 1990s when State Route 509 was routed around the edge of the tideflats (see East 21st Street Bridge). While WSDOT wanted to tear down the bridge, the City of Tacoma convinced the state to transfer ownership to the City. In the past, the bridge has been heavily used by commuters and emergency services in connecting the Port of Tacoma with downtown Tacoma. In 2007, the bridge was closed because of safety concerns and the general wear and tear that the bridge had suffered in its near 100-year lifespan. Soon afterwards, the city began a large rehabilitation project to completely overhaul all aspects of the bridge. In 2010, the bridge began periodically opening to bikes and pedestrians. In February 2013, the bridge re-opened to all traffic.  Name  Originally known as the 11th Street Bridge, it was renamed May 21, 1997, to honor Tacoma-born Murray Morgan (1916‚Äì2000), the best-known Pacific Northwest historian of his generation, and author of \\"Skid Road\\", a history of Seattle, Washington. Morgan was a bridge tender on the bridge during the 1950s. In fact, he wrote most of \\"Skid Road\\" during quiet periods on the job.  Closure  The bridge was officially closed to vehicles on October 23, 2007, due to \\"life safety concerns\\".Safety Concerns Close Murray Morgan Bridge WSDOT Press Release The bridge re-opened February 2013 after a large rehabilitation project.  Opening  On February 1, 2013, the bridge re-opened after a large rehabilitation project was completely finished. Down from four lanes to two, the bridge is now solid black (its original color) and features antique-esque lighting (actually LED bulbs) to celebrate the bridge's centennial anniversary. The outer two lanes were converted to larger pedestrian paths and bike lanes. An elevator connects pedestrians and bikes to Dock Street below the bridge. The bridge's environmental impact has been lessened; a new water runoff system routes rainwater to tanks that contribute to a rain garden on the east side of the bridge. The computers, cables, and motors that operate the lift in the center of the structure were also updated.  Damage  On December 15, 2010 it was discovered that thieves had broken into the mechanical room and stolen wiring from the control panel used to raise the bridge for ship traffic on the Foss Waterway. As part of the rehabilitation project, the computers and electrics in the bridge were replaced.

Based in Montgomery, Alabama, Stevenson has challenged bias against the poor and minorities in the criminal justice system, especially children. He has helped achieve United States Supreme Court decisions that prohibit sentencing children under 18 to death or to life imprisonment without parole. Stevenson has assisted in cases that have saved dozens of prisoners from the death penalty, advocated for the poor, and developed community-based reform litigation aimed at improving the administration of criminal justice. He was depicted in the legal drama Just Mercy which is based on his memoir Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, which tells the story of Walter McMillian. He initiated the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, which honors the names of each of more than 4,000 African Americans lynched in the 12 states of the South from 1877 to 1950. He argues that the history of slavery and lynchings has influenced the subsequent high rate of death sentences in the South, where it has been disproportionately applied to minorities. A related museum, The Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration, offers interpretations to show the connection between the post-Reconstruction period of lynchings to the high rate of executions and incarceration of people of color in the United States. In November 2018, Stevenson received the Benjamin Franklin Award from the American Philosophical Society as a \\"Drum major for justice and mercy.\\" This is the most prestigious award the society gives for distinguished public service. In 2020, he shared Right Livelihood Award, widely known as \\"Alternate Nobel Prize\\" with Nasrin Sotoudeh, Ales Bialiatski, and Lottie Cunningham Wren. Early life Born on November 14, 1959, Stevenson grew up in Milton, Delaware, a small rural town located in southern Delaware. His father Howard Carlton Stevenson, Sr., had grown up in Milton, and his mother Alice Gertrude (Golden) Stevenson was born and grew up in Philadelphia. Her family had moved to the city from Virginia in the Great Migration of the early 20th century. Stevenson has two siblings: an older brother Howard, Jr. and a sister Christy. Both parents commuted to the northern part of the state for work, with Howard, Sr., working at a General Foods processing plant as a laboratory technician and Alice as an equal opportunity officer at Dover Air Force Base. She particularly emphasized the importance of education. Stevenson's family attended the Prospect African Methodist Episcopal Church, where as a child, Stevenson played piano and sang in the choir. His later views were influenced by the strong faith of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, where churchgoers were celebrated for \\"standing up after having fallen down\\". These experiences informed his belief that \\"each person in our society is more than the worst thing they‚Äôve ever done.‚Äù When Stevenson was 16, his maternal grandfather, Clarence L. Golden, was stabbed to death in his Philadelphia home during a robbery. The killers received life sentences, an outcome Stevenson thought fair. Stevenson said of the murder: \\"Because my grandfather was older, his murder seemed particularly cruel. But I came from a world where we valued redemption over revenge.\\" As a child, Stevenson dealt with segregation and its legacy. He spent his first classroom years at a \\"colored\\" elementary school. By the time he entered the second grade, his school was formally desegregated, but the old rules from segregation still applied. Black kids played separately from white kids, and at the doctor's or dentist's office, black kids and their parents continued to use the back door, while whites entered through the front. Pools and other community facilities were informally segregated. Stevenson's father, having grown up in the area, took the ingrained racism in stride, but their mother noted that this was not right. In an interview in 2017, Stevenson recalled how his mother protested the day the black children from town lined up at the back door of the polio vaccination station to receive their shots, waiting hours while the white children went in first.  Education  Stevenson attended Cape Henlopen High School and graduated in 1978. He played on the soccer and baseball teams. He also served as president of the student body and won American Legion public speaking contests. His brother, Howard, takes some credit for helping hone Stevenson's rhetorical skills: ‚ÄúWe argued the way brothers argue, but these were serious arguments, inspired I guess by our mother and the circumstances of our family growing up.‚Äù Stevenson earned straight A's and won a scholarship to Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania. On campus, he directed the campus gospel choir. Stevenson graduated in 1981. Stevenson earned a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School and a master's degree in Public Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. During law school, as part of a class on race and poverty litigation with Elizabeth Bartholet, he worked for Stephen Bright's Southern Center for Human Rights, an organization that represents death-row inmates throughout the South. During this work, Stevenson found his career calling. Career =Southern Center for Human Rights= After graduating from Harvard in 1985, Stevenson moved to Atlanta, and joined the Southern Center for Human Rights full-time. The center divided work by region and Stevenson was assigned to Alabama. In 1989 he was appointed to run the Alabama operation, a resource center and death-penalty defense organization that was funded by Congress. He had a center in Montgomery, the state capital. =Equal Justice Initiative= When the United States Congress eliminated funding for death-penalty defense, Stevenson converted the center and founded the non- profit Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) in Montgomery. In 1995, he was awarded a MacArthur Grant and put all the money toward supporting the center. He guaranteed a defense of anyone in Alabama sentenced to the death penalty, as it was the only state that did not provide legal assistance to people on death row. It also has the highest per capita rate of death penalty sentencing. One of EJI‚Äôs first cases was the post-conviction appeal of McMillian, who had spent months on death row before being convicted of murder. Stevenson was able to discredit every element of the prosecution‚Äôs initial case, which led to McMillian being exonerated and released from jail in 1993. Stevenson has been particularly concerned about overly harsh sentencing of persons convicted of crimes committed as children, under the age of 18. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Roper v. Simmons that the death penalty was unconstitutional for persons convicted of crimes committed under the age of 18. Stevenson worked to have the court's thinking about appropriate punishment broadened to related cases applying to children convicted under the age of 17. EJI mounted a litigation campaign to gain review of cases in which convicted children were sentenced to life-without-parole, including in cases without homicide. In Miller v. Alabama (2012), the US Supreme Court ruled in a landmark decision that mandatory sentences of life-without-parole for children 17 and under were unconstitutional; their decision has affected statutes in 29 states. In 2016, the court ruled in Montgomery v. Louisiana that this decision had to be applied retroactively, potentially affecting the sentences of 2300 people nationwide who had been sentenced to life while still children. By August 2016, EJI has saved 125 men from the death penalty. In addition, it has represented poor people, defended people on appeal and overturned wrongful convictions, and worked to alleviate bias in the criminal justice system. =Acknowledging slavery= The EJI offices are near the landing at the Alabama River where slaves were unloaded in the domestic slave trade; an equal distance away is Court Square, \\"one of the largest slave auction sites in the country.\\" Stevenson has noted that in downtown Montgomery, there were \\"dozens\\" of historic markers and numerous monuments related to Confederate history, but nothing acknowledging the history of slavery, on which the wealth of the South was based and for which it fought the Civil War. He proposed to the state and provided documentation to three slavery sites with historic markers; the Alabama Department of Archives and History told him that it did not want to \\"sponsor the markers given the potential for controversy.\\" Stevenson worked with an African-American history group to gain sponsorship for this project; they gained state approval for the three markers in 2013, and these have been installed in Montgomery. =National Memorial for Peace and Justice= Stevenson acquired six acres of former public housing land in Montgomery for the development of a new project, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, to commemorate the nearly 4,000 persons who were lynched in the South from 1877 to 1950. Many lynchings were conducted openly in front of mobs and crowds in county courthouse squares. Stevenson argues this history of extrajudicial lynchings by white mobs is closely associated with the subsequent high rate of death sentences imposed in Alabama and other southern states, and to their disproportionate application to minority people. He further argues that this history influences the bias against minorities as expressed in disproportionately high mass incarceration rates for them across the country. The memorial opened in April 2018. Associated with the Memorial is the Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration, which also opened in April 2018. Exhibits in the former slave warehouse include materials on lynching, racial segregation, and mass incarceration since the late 20th century. Stevenson articulates how the treatment of people of color under the criminal justice system is related to the history of slavery and later treatment of minorities in the South. =Author= Stevenson wrote the critically acclaimed memoir Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, published in 2014 by Spiegel & Grau. It was selected by Time magazine as one of the \\"10 Best Books of Nonfiction\\" for 2014, and was among The New York Times \\"100 Notable Books\\" for the year. It won the 2015 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction and the 2015 Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Nonfiction. A film based on the book, called Just Mercy and starring Michael B. Jordan as Stevenson, premiered on September 6, 2019, at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released in theatres on December 25, 2019. =Speaker= Stevenson conducts an active public speaking schedule, in large part for fundraising for the work of EJI. His speech at TED2012 in Long Beach, California brought him a wide audience on the Internet. Following his presentation, attendees at the conference contributed more than $1 million to fund a campaign run by Stevenson to end the practice of placing convicted children to serve sentences in adult jails and prisons. His talk is available on the TED website; by April 2020, it had been viewed more than 6.5 million times. Stevenson has been a commencement speaker and received numerous honorary degrees, including from the following institutions: University of Delaware, 2016, honorary Doctor of Laws degree; Williams College, 2016, honorary doctorate; Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, 2011, Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa;Loyola University Chicago, Office of Registration & Records College of the Holy Cross, 2015; Wesleyan University, 2016, honorary degree; University of Mississippi, 2017s fall convocation; Northeastern University, fall 2017 convocation; Emory University, spring 2020 commencement and honorary doctor of laws degree. In June 2017, Stevenson delivered the 93rd Ware Lecture at the General Assembly of the Unitarian Universalist Association in New Orleans, Louisiana, joining the ranks of previous lecturers including Martin Luther King, Jr. and Kurt Vonnegut. Stevenson is featured in episode 45 of the podcast Criminal by Radiotopia from PRX. Host Phoebe Judge talked with Stevenson about his experiences during his 30 years spent working to get people off of death row, and about his take on the deserving of mercy. On May 24, 2018, Stevenson delivered the Commencement address for The Johns Hopkins University Class of 2018. =Awards= * 1991 ACLU National Medal of Liberty\\"Bryan Stevenson honored with National Civil Rights Museum‚Äôs Freedom Award and ABA‚Äôs Thurgood Marshall Award\\", NYU Law News, August 9, 2016. *1995 MacArthur Fellow * 2000 Olof Palme Prize * 2009 Gruber Prize for Justice * 2011 Four Freedoms Award * 2012 Smithsonian magazine's American Ingenuity Award in Social Progress * 2014 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction and Nonfiction * 2015 Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Nonfiction * 2017 The Stowe Prize for Writing to Advance Social Justice * 2018 The Benjamin Franklin Award for distinguished public service from the American Philosophical Society * 2019 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement * 2020 Right Livelihood Award Personal life Stevenson is a lifelong bachelor and has stated that his career is incompatible with married life.

It was conceived by Richard L. Snyder, Jr., Jan A. Rajchman, Paul Rudnick and the digital computer group at the laboratories of the Radio Corporation of America under the direction of Vladimir Zworykin. Development began in 1941 under contract OEM-sr-591 to Division 7 of the National Defense Research Committee of the United States Office of Research and Development.David A. Mindell Between human and machine: feedback, control, and computing before cybernetics,JHU Press, 2002 , page 292 The numerical function of the Computron was to solve the equation S=(A*B)+C+D where A, B, C, and D are 14 bit inputs and S is a 28 bit output. This function was key to the RCA attempt to produce a non-analog computer based fire-control system for use in artillery aiming during WWII. A simple way to describe the physically complex Computron is to begin with a cathode ray tube structure in the form of a right-circular cylinder with a central vertical cathode structure. The cylinder is composed of 14 discrete planes, each plane having 14 individual radial outward projecting beams. Each of the 196 individual beams is steered by multiple deflection plates toward its two targets. Some deflection plates are connected to circuitry external to the Computron and are the data inputs. The balance of the plates are connected to internal targets and are the partial sums and products from other stages within the tube. Some of the targets are connected to circuitry outside the tube and represent the result. The electronic function of the Computron design incorporated steered, rather than gated, multiple electron beams. Additionally, the Computron was based on the ability of a secondary electron emission target, under electron bombardment, to assume the potential of the nearest collector electrode. The Additron Tube design by Josef Kates gated electron beams of a fixed trajectory with several control grids which either passed or blocked a current. The Computron was a complex cathode ray tube while the Additron was a triode with multiple grids and targets. A subsection of the Computron was prototyped and tested and the concept validated but the building of an entire device was never attempted. A United States Patent was filed 30 July 1943 and granted 22 July 1947 for the Computron.  Modern implications  The Computron design was an early attempt to produce not only a vacuum tube integrated circuit for both size and reliability (lifetime) issues, but to minimize external electrical connections between active elements. The goal of integration is not merely to reduce external signal connections into and out of a package by including multiple active devices in one package, as in the Loewe 3NF tube. It is to merge the functions of the active devices for a technical synergy. A modern example would be the multiple-emitter transistor of transistor‚Äìtransistor logic integrated circuits Another modern construct anticipated by the Computron is the barrel shifter circuit which is used in many numeric computation style microprocessors.  Damning praise  The Computron was an idea born of the necessity of war research. It was to be a key element of the electronic digital computer which had yet to be built. But the project was begun to increase the accuracy of artillery in battle, not to advance the state of the embryonic electronic computer. Its fate was well described in a letter to Dr. Paul E. Klopsteg, Head of NDRC Division 17, dated 6 February 1943 which concludes: > ...As I said above, our entire Division is exceedingly reluctant to see a > development which is scientifically so beautiful and so promising dropped at > this point, though cold reason tells us that we cannot justify the > expenditure of additional Government funds on the basis of Fire Control at > this time. > > Sincerely yours, > Harold L.

He spent his early years at Jan√≥w at a time when Poland was under occupation by Nazi Germany before ultimately arriving in the United States in 1945, where he lived for the remainder of his life until his death. His name came from an archaic Polish word meaning \\"chieftain, knight, prince and hero.\\"Smith, Linell. And Miles to Go: The Biography of a Great Arabian Horse, Witez II Little Brown & Company, 1967. ,  Ancestry  Witez II was by Ofir out of Federacja. Ofir was by the desert-bred stallion Kuhalian-Haifi, foaled in 1923, who was imported from the Jauf region of the Arabian peninsula by Prince Roman Sanguszko of the Gumniska stud. Seeking an outcross for his mares, Sanguszko sent Bogdan Zientarski, accompanied by Carl Raswan, to buy horses from the desert in 1931. Kuhalian-Haifi died in 1935, having only sired 14 foals, of whom Ofir is the best-known. Federacja was a Polish-bred mare with bloodlines tracing to both Polish breeding and that of the Babolna stud of Hungary. The 1938 foal crop was Ofir's first, and contained three colts that became sires of significance in the Arabian breed: Witez II; Witraz (Ofir x Makata), who was the sire of Bask; and the noted broodmare sire, Wielki Szlem (Ofir x Elegantka). During World War II, Ofir and Federacja were among the horses of Jan√≥w that were taken by the Russians during the Soviet invasion of Poland. Ofir was later used at the Tersk Stud in the USSR, where he sired the mare Mammona, a dam of significance in a number of Russian bloodlines.  Early years  Witez II was only a yearling when Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939. With both the Soviet Union and Germany occupying the country, the Jan√≥w stud was temporarily evacuated. However, though Jan√≥w was on the German side of the Curzon line, the Russian military nonetheless confiscated most of the mature breeding stock as spoils of war. Witez II, along with the bulk of the young horses, avoided this fate and ultimately was returned to Jan√≥w, which was soon under the management of the German military. As young horse, he was put into race training, but because of wartime cancellation of horse racing during the occupation of Poland, he was not taken to the track. Instead, he was put to stud, first at Jan√≥w, and then was taken to Hostau in what today is the Czech Republic, where the Nazis had gathered significant bloodstock of all different breeds from across the Third Reich. General George S. Patton, commander of the U.S. 3rd Army, was a lifelong horseman who competed in Modern Pentathlon at the 1912 Olympic Games. He had been tipped off by Alois Podhajsky of the Spanish Riding School that a significant number of Lipizzans and Thoroughbreds, as well as Arabian horses were at Hostau. When Hostau fell behind Soviet lines, captured German officers, under interrogation by U.S. Army Captain Ferdinand Sperl, reported the location of the stud farm and asked the Americans to rescue the horses before they fell into Soviet hands, because it was feared they would be slaughtered for horsemeat. Patton issued orders, and on April 28, 1945, Colonel Charles H. Reed, Sperl's superior officer, with members of Troops A, C and F of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, conducted a raid behind Soviet lines and accepted the surrender of the Germans at Hostau. Reed later said that the surrender was \\"more a fiesta than a military operation, as the German troops drew up an honor guard and saluted the American troops as they came in.\\" Being one of the relatively few horses at Hostau who was broke to ride, Witez II carried a rider throughout the evacuation and came through sound.  Life in America  At the end of the war, Witez II and other horses captured from the Nazis were shipped to the United States, much to the dismay of the Poles, who had hoped to recover the horses they had lost. The journey by ship from Europe to America was quite rough, but the horses arrived safely in Newport News, Virginia in late 1945, and spent the winter at the U.S. Army Remount station at Front Royal, Virginia.Carpenter, Marian K. Arabian Legends: Outstanding Arabian Stallions and Mares Colorado Springs, Colorado: Western Horseman, 1999 In early 1946, Witez II and the bulk of the imported Arabians were shipped to the Army Remount station at the former W.K. Kellogg Arabian Ranch in Pomona, California,Edwards, Gladys Brown The Arabian: War Horse to Show Horse 3rd Revised Edition Denver, Colorado: Arabian Horse Trust 1980 p. 112-116 where he stood at stud until 1948. In that year, the remount service was put under the authority of the United States Department of Agriculture, and the horses were sent off for auction. Witez II was purchased in 1949 by Earle E. and Frances Hurlbutt of the Calarabia Ranch near Calabasas, California, who owned him for the remainder of his life. Because the remount horses had been shipped to a consolidated site in Oklahoma for sale, Hurlbutt flew to Fort Reno, Oklahoma, specifically to bid on the stallion, and paid $8100 for the horse. Witez II lived on the Hurlbutt ranch for many years, but left California from 1960 to 1964 on a lease to Burr Betts of the Betts Circle 2 Ranch in Parker, Colorado. He returned to Calarabia for the final year of his life. Although not shown a great deal in America, he was 1951 Grand Champion at the Southern California All-Arabian show in Pomona, one of the largest shows of the day, and then Pacific Coast Champion Stallion and overall grand champion in 1953, at the age of 15, winning one of the most prestigious awards for Arabian horses at the time. He sired 223 foals, of whom 10 had been born outside the USA prior to his importation. His offspring included 16 national winners in both halter and performance, which was particularly notable because the first U.S. National Championship show was not held until 1958.\\"A Toast to Champions\\", Arabian Horse World, October, 2007, pp. 164‚Äì185 His daughter Ronteza made a significant mark in open competition, winning the 1961 World Champion Reined Cow Horse at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, defeating 50 horses of all breeds. Witez II passed away while sleeping peacefully in his pasture at Calarbia, June 1965, shortly after his 27th birthday.

Biography =Early life= Dunavant was born on December 19, 1932 to William and Dorothy Dunavant. He was educated first at The McCallie School in Chattanooga, then at Vanderbilt University, and received his bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Memphis State University. His maternal grandfather, T.J. White, was a cotton farmer from Tunica, Mississippi. His paternal grandfather, Colonel William P. Dunavant was in the railroad business and created one of the main cotton transporting railroads of the time. His father began working for T.J. White and Company at the age of 21. After White retired, the company was passed to Dunavant's father and renamed Dunavant Enterprises. When the senior Dunavant died in 1961, Dunavant inherited the company at the age of 29. =Career= When Dunavant took over the company in 1961, it handled around 100,000 bales of cotton a year, and ninety percent of their sales were in the United States. Today, the company sells over 4 million bales of cotton to more than 80 countries around the world. Dunavant Enterprises is on the Forbes 400 list of largest private companies (Forbes Ranking) and according to the Memphis Business Journal, it is the largest private company in Memphis. According to a 1976 article in the Memphis Commercial Appeal, \\"Dunavant's company was one of the first to go into 'future contracting,' whereby a farmer agrees to a price before he plants. It's a risky venture speculating on future cotton prices but Dunavant prospered while others floundered.\\" On March 13, 2007 Dunavant was inducted into the Futures Industry Association's Hall of Fame for his work in the cotton futures business. After a successful career in the cotton industry, Dunavant stepped down as chief executive officer in 2005. Before his retirement Dunavant completed gross sale of $225 million to China, the second-largest cotton sale in history. Although Dunavant is no longer the CEO, he intends to remain chairman of the board. Dunavant is active in Memphis-area philanthropy, working with institutions such as Rhodes College, Memphis University School, and Boy Scouts of America. Dunavant's love of tennis inspired him to build the Memphis Racquet Club in 1972. His aspirations for a professional football team resulted in him selling the Racquet Club in 1992. Dunavant was the owner of the Memphis Showboats of the United States Football League and a principal investor in the Memphis Hound Dogs, a proposed National Football League expansion team that was rejected in 1993.

The storm developed south of Sydney on the afternoon of Wednesday, 14 April 1999 and struck the city's eastern suburbs, including the central business district, later that evening.Zillman (1999), 19. The storm dropped an estimated 500,000 tonnes of hailstones in its path.Steingold, et al. (1999), 2.Henri (1999), 16. Insured damages caused by the storm were over A$1.7 billion,Schuster, et al. (2005), 1. with the total damage bill (including uninsured damages) estimated to be around A$2.3 billion.Emergency Management Australia (2006).Coenraads (2006), 229. It was the costliest in Australian history in insured damages, surpassing the A$1.1 billion in insured damages caused by the 1989 Newcastle earthquake. Lightning also claimed one life during the storm, and the event caused approximately 50 injuries.Bureau of Meteorology (2007).Emergency Management Australia (2003), 61. The storm was classified as a supercell following further analysis of its erratic nature and extreme attributes. During the event, the Bureau of Meteorology was constantly surprised by the frequent changes in direction, as well as the severity of the hail and the duration of the storm. The event was also surprising as neither the time of year, time of day, nor the general meteorological conditions in the region were seen as conducive for extreme storm cell formation.Zillman (1999), 29. Conditions and climatology The conditions around Sydney on Wednesday, 14 April were calm, although a slight instability in atmospheric conditions was recorded by the Bureau of Meteorology in the region. Two instability events had been identified in the greater Sydney area, but both were considered minor by the meteorological agencies. A weak cold front was moving north along the coast, and moderate precipitation was falling over the Blue Mountains, southwest of the city. The meteorological reports and figures, however, suggested that the general atmospheric conditions were \\"not conducive\\" to support the formation of a major thunderstorm in the region.Whitaker (2005), 99. Historical records show that the formation of severe thunderstorms for the time of day and year had been rare, and it was improbable that they would maintain their intensity and cause significant damage.Zillman (1999), i.Leigh (1999). This long-standing belief contributed to the Bureau of Meteorology's decision not to issue warnings in the early part of the storm's development. The 1999 event was only the second time in recorded history that hail larger than had fallen in the Sydney metropolitan area in the month of April,Bureau of Meteorology (1999). and only the fifth hailstorm to strike Sydney during April in the 200 years of meteorological records for the city.Collings et al. (2000). Hailstorms have had a history of significant damage in Australia. Since records on insured losses by the Insurance Disaster Response Organisation began in 1967 three other hailstorms ‚Äì Sydney in 1986 and 1990, as well as Brisbane in 1985 ‚Äì feature on the top- ten list of most insured damages caused by a single natural disaster, in addition to the 1999 storm. Hailstorms have caused more than 30% of all insured damages inflicted as a result of natural disasters in Australia during this period, and around three-quarters of all hailstorm damage has occurred in New South Wales. Development of the storm =Formation and southern Sydney= Path of the storm from formation and in the southern regions of Sydney The storm cell formed at 4:25 pm AEST to the north of Nowra, roughly south-southwest of Sydney. After forming, it initially headed towards the coast in a northeasterly direction. The cell passed just to the west of Kiama at around 5:15 pm and gained a 'severe' classification from the Bureau of Meteorology at the same time.Zillman (1999), 17. 'Severe' is a classification used by the Bureau of Meteorology for thunderstorms which meet a specific criteria, namely producing hailstones with a diameter of or more, wind gusts of or greater and flash flooding, or tornadoes. This classification is also used by the Bureau to classify the attributes of a storm at any given time during its life.Zillman (1999), 6. The storm continued to move in a northeasterly direction, crossing the coast just north of Kiama at 5:25 pm. It was downgraded from a severe thunderstorm and proceeded to move further off the coast for another 15 minutes while gaining speed to around . The storm then veered northward at 5:40 pm and continued parallel to the coast. Around 6:00 pm, directly east of Wollongong, the storm changed direction again, this time to north-northeast, and continued parallel to the coastline. Moderate hailstones were recorded falling in Wollongong as the western edge of the storm passed over the area, and the storm was reclassified as severe. The storm moved parallel to the coast in a north-northeasterly direction for the next fifty minutes. It maintained a severe classification though did not impact heavily on the coastal suburbs, because it was entirely offshore. The western edge of the storm, however, recrossed the coastline just east of Helensburgh, south-southwest of Sydney, at about 7:00 pm. Ten minutes later the direction of the storm veered slightly more northward and the centre of the storm crossed back onto land at Bundeena at around 7:20 pm.Zillman (1999), 18 =Immediate Sydney region= Path of the storm over the eastern suburbs area of Sydney The Bureau of Meteorology had not issued warnings for Sydney Airport, located on the northern shore of Botany Bay, or the rest of the eastern suburbs to prepare for large hail. They were not expecting the storm to veer northward again, but rather to continue to head further out into the Tasman Sea in a consistent north-northeasterly direction.Department of the Environment and Heritage (1999), iii. After crossing the coast, the storm continued to move northward, crossing Botany Bay at 7:40 pm and reaching the Airport five minutes later. It travelled across the eastern suburbs between Botany Bay and Sydney Harbour between 7:45 pm and 8:05 pm, dropping massive hailstones on both houses and businesses in the eastern suburbs district and the central business district. Some of the largest hailstones ever to be recorded in the Sydney region fell on the eastern suburbs during this storm. There were reports of diameter hailstones in the eastern suburbs, although the largest confirmed hailstone was in diameter.Zillman (1999), iii. It was the first time in 52 years that stones greater than had fallen in Sydney, with the last reported event being the 1947 hailstorm. The storm continued across Sydney Harbour and changed direction slightly to be heading north. It weakened after travelling over the Harbour, and was downgraded from a severe storm at 8:15 pm. The Bureau of Meteorology had concluded that the storm would weaken after heading across Sydney Harbour, believing it was dissipating and would therefore not produce any more substantial hail as it moved northward; therefore it did not issue warnings for the northern suburbs. =Northern Suburbs and dissipation= Path of the storm after crossing Sydney Harbour until dissipating The storm then continued north for twenty minutes over the North Shore suburbs of Sydney before regaining strength and veering north- northwest again, redeveloping severe thunderstorm characteristics. The storm's redevelopment again caught the Bureau of Meteorology off-guard, who had expected the storm to dissipate and move out to sea without causing further substantial damage. It proceeded to drop large amounts of hail on the northern beach suburbs of Mona Vale and Palm Beach around 8:50 pm, and the centre of the storm again crossed the coast and back out to sea just after 9:00 pm. The storm maintained its intensity, however, and continued to move in a northwesterly direction across Broken Bay. The western edge of the storm had a minor impact on southern suburbs of the Central Coast between 9:15 pm and 9:30 pm. The storm moved entirely off the coastline and into open water at around 9:45 pm. It then dissipated rapidly around 9:55 pm, directly east of Gosford. It was subsequently downgraded from severe status and the storm cell had faded completely by 10:00 pm. Aftermath =Secondary storm cell= The Bureau of Meteorology radar image from 8:10 pm, showing the first cell directly over the Sydney central business district and the second cell approximately south along the coastline A second, far smaller storm cell passed along a similar route to the first later in the evening of 14 April. This cell was never given the classification of 'severe' by the Bureau of Meteorology, nor did it develop into a supercell like its predecessor.Whitaker (2005), 97. Therefore, the route of the second cell was more direct and predictable than the first, following the general movement of the cold front (see conditions and climatology), and the Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings to all residents in the second cell's projected path to expect further storm activity.Whitaker (2005), 101. The secondary cell passed through Sydney two hours later than the first, just after 10:00 pm, having been approximately south of Sydney when the supercell struck. It dropped hail up to in diameter, as well as producing heavy rainfall. Damage caused by the second cell was mostly due to rain coming in through roofs already damaged by hail from the first cell. Hail from the second cell also contributed to the damage.Whitaker (2005), 103‚Äì4. =Damage caused= The downpour of an estimated 500,000 tonnes of hail across Sydney suburbia resulted in widespread damage on the coastal suburbs in its path. Insured losses due to the disaster reached roughly A$1.7 billion, with total costs estimated to be around A$2.3 billion. The storm was the costliest natural disaster ever to hit Australia in terms of insured losses, surpassing the 1989 Newcastle earthquake by around A$600 million. The areas that incurred the most damage were between Lilli Pilli and Darling Point, located apart on the coastline of Sydney.NSW State Emergency Service (2005). The vast majority of damage was done by hail and rain. Approximately 24,000 houses were significantly damaged, with many suffering water damage through the holes in roofs that the large hailstones created. The stones were estimated as travelling at up to in some periods of the storm, causing indentation damage to around 70,000 vehicles.Schuster, et al. (2005), 2. Twenty-three aeroplanes and helicopters at Sydney Airport were reported as having incurred notable damage from the hail, caused by the inability to place them under hangars in time to avoid the storm. This has been significantly attributed to a lack of warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology, who had expected the storm to continue moving further out into the Tasman Sea in the north-northeasterly direction in which it had previously been travelling. The most significant insurance costs were in the areas of residential property damage with 31.8% of total payments, motor vehicle damage with 28.6% and for properties which service the commercial and industrial sectors at 27.5%. Damage to aviation property, mainly planes at the vulnerable Sydney Airport, amounted to 5.9% of the claims, while 5.8% of all insurance payments were made for 'business interruption' and 0.4% for damage to boats as well as other miscellaneous claims. The storm caused one fatality; a 45-year-old man, who was fishing about from the north shore of Dolans Bay in the Port Hacking estuary, was killed when his boat was struck by lightning. Fifty injuries were recorded, caused by flying objects, road accidents due to poor visibility and smashed windscreens and other factors. =Emergency response= The aftermath of the storm on a suburban Sydney street Owing to the magnitude of the storm, the State Emergency Service were aided by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, the New South Wales Fire Brigades and the Australian Capital Territory Emergency Service in recovery work. Within hours of the storm striking the city, all affected areas were declared as 'disaster zones' and the New South Wales Government, under Premier Bob Carr, invoked a state of emergency, which gave control and co-ordination of the response to the State Emergency Service.Emergency Management Australia (2004). In the days following the storm, John Moore (Minister for Defence) approved a request for 300 Australian Defence Force personnel to assist recovery operations, although their assistance was only for one week while resources were stretched. The government, one week later, \\"unexpectedly\\" removed complete control from the State Emergency Service and placed certain suburbs and areas under the control of the Rural Fire Service and Fire Brigade.Head (1999). In the five hours following the storm striking Sydney, the State Emergency Service received 2,000 emergency calls to 1,092 separate incidents.Wilson (n.d.). In total, the State Emergency Service received 25,301 calls for assistance to 15,007 incidents, with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service also receiving 19,437.Geoscience Australia (n.d.). The recovery and clean-up mission used an estimated A$10 million worth of tarpaulin covers while waiting for permanent repairs. After nine days, approximately 3,000 buildings (out of a total of 127,947 initially damaged) were still waiting for assistance and temporary fixes to shattered roofs and windows, while a similar number still required assistance a further week later (as a number of tarpaulins became detached or otherwise ineffective). One month after the disaster, the main priority of the emergency services was ensuring that temporary fixes remained in place, as Sydney suffered further adverse weather in the period immediately following the storm. A study of a sample taken of affected areas suggested that roughly 62% of buildings in the affected areas suffered damage to roofs, around 34% to windows and 53% to vehicles. Construction of infrastructure for 2000 Sydney Olympics in the city's west at the time meant there was a deficiency of tradespeople who could be contracted to repair roofs and windows. Estimates put between 45,000 and 50,000 tradespeople in Sydney at the time of the storm, yet owing to high demand \\"companies were quoting householders [A]$14,000 or more for roof repairs which would normally cost $3,000.\\" The situation led to a warning from Minister for Fair Trade John Watkins on the day following the storm, urging homeowners to ensure that tradespeople working to repair homes were fully qualified and legitimate.Australian Associated Press (1999).

It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common intestinal parasite or helminth, especially in humans.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The medical condition associated with pinworm infestation is known as pinworm infection (enterobiasis)Merriam- Webster: Enterobiasis (a type of helminthiasis) or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae.Merriam-Webster: Oxyuriasis Other than human, Enterobius vermicularis were reported from bonnet macaque. Other species seen in primates include Enterobius buckleyi in Orangutan and Enterobius anthropopitheci in chimpanzee. Enterobius vermicularis is common in human children and transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Humans are the only natural host of Enterobius vermicularis. Enterobius gregorii, another human species is morphologically indistinguishable from Enterobius vermicularis except the spicule size. Throughout this article, the word \\"pinworm\\" refers to Enterobius. In British usage, however, pinworm refers to Strongyloides, while Enterobius is called threadworm.Vanderkooi 2000, p. B-152 & B-225  Classification  The pinworm (genus Enterobius) is a type of roundworm (nematode), and three species of pinworm have been identified with certainty.NCBI taxonomy database 2009 Humans are hosts only to Enterobius vermicularis (formerly Oxyurias vermicularis).dpdx 2009 Chimpanzees are host to Enterobius anthropopitheci, which is morphologically distinguishable from the human pinworm.Hasegawa et al. 2006 Hugot (1983) claims another species affects humans, Enterobius gregorii, which is supposedly a sister species of E. vermicularis, and has a slightly smaller spicule (i.e., sexual organ).Hugot 1983 Its existence is controversial, however; Totkova et al. (2003) consider the evidence to be insufficient,Totkova et al. 2003 and Hasegawa et al. (2006) contend that E. gregorii is a younger stage of E. vermicularis.Hasegawa et al. 1998 Regardless of its status as a distinct species, E. gregorii is considered clinically identical to E. vermicularis.  Morphology  Two female pinworms next to a ruler: The markings are 1 mm apart. The adult female has a sharply pointed posterior end, is 8 to 13 mm long, and 0.5 mm thick.Guti√©rrez 2005, p. 354. The adult male is considerably smaller, measuring 2 to 5 mm long and 0.2 mm thick, and has a curved posterior end. The eggs are translucent and have a surface that adheres to objects. The eggs measure 50 to 60 Œºm by 20 to 30 Œºm, and have a thick shell flattened on one side. The small size and colourlessness of the eggs make them invisible to the naked eye, except in barely visible clumps of thousands of eggs. Eggs may contain a developing embryo or a fully developed pinworm larva. The larvae grow to 140‚Äì150 Œºm in length.Cook 1994, p. 1159 Image:Pinworms in the Appendix (1).jpgPinworms are sometimes diagnosed incidentally by pathology.

Image:Head of Enterobius vermicularis human pinworm 5230 lores.jpgThis micrograph reveals the cephalic alae in the head region of E. vermicularis. Image:Enterobius vermicularis-1.jpgE. vermicularis Life cycle Life cycle of E. vermicularis showing the stages inside and outside of the human body The entire life cycle, from egg to adult, takes place in the human gastrointestinal tract of a single host, from about 2‚Äì4 weeksCook et al. 2009, p. 1516 or about 4‚Äì8 weeks. The life cycle begins with eggs being ingested. The eggs hatch in the duodenum (i.e., first part of the small intestine). The emerging pinworm larvae grow rapidly to a size of 140 to 150 Œºm, and migrate through the small intestine towards the colon. During this migration, they moult twice and become adults. Females survive for 5 to 13 weeks, and males about 7 weeks. The male and female pinworms mate in the ileum (i.e., last part of the small intestine), whereafter the male pinworms usually die,Garcia 1999, p. 246 and are passed out with stool.Caldwell 1982, p. 307. The gravid female pinworms settle in the ileum, caecum (i.e., beginning of the large intestine), appendix and ascending colon, where they attach themselves to the mucosa and ingest colonic contents. Almost the entire body of a gravid female becomes filled with eggs. The estimations of the number of eggs in a gravid female pinworm range from about 11,000 to 16,000. The egg-laying process begins about five weeks after initial ingestion of pinworm eggs by the human host. The gravid female pinworms migrate through the colon towards the rectum at a rate of 12 to 14 cm per hour. They emerge from the anus, and while moving on the skin near the anus, the female pinworms deposit eggs either through (1) contracting and expelling the eggs, (2) dying and then disintegrating, or (3) bodily rupture due to the host scratching the worm. After depositing the eggs, the female becomes opaque and dies. The female emerges from the anus to obtain the oxygen necessary for the maturation of the eggs. Infection E. vermicularis causes the medical condition enterobiasis, whose primary symptom is itching in the anal area. Distribution The pinworm has a worldwide distribution,Guti√©rrez 2005, p. 355. and is the most common helminth (i.e., parasitic worm) infection in the United States, western Europe, and Oceania.Burkhart & burkhart 2005, p. 837 In the United States, a study by the Center of Disease Control reported an overall incidence rate of 11.4% among children. Pinworms are particularly common in children, with prevalence rates in this age group having been reported as high as 61% in India, 50% in England, 39% in Thailand, 37% in Sweden, and 29% in Denmark. Finger sucking has been shown to increase both incidence and relapse rates, and nail biting has been similarly associated.Cook 1994, p. 1160 Because it spreads from host to host through contamination, pinworms are common among people living in close contact, and tends to occur in all people within a household. The prevalence of pinworms is not associated with gender, nor with any particular social class, race, or culture. Pinworms are an exception to the tenet that intestinal parasites are uncommon in affluent communities.

Photo from between 1890-1900. The Nordland boat (or ), is a type of fishing boat that has been used for centuries in northern counties of Nordland, Troms and Finnmark of Norway and derives its name from Nordland county where it has a long history. It has dominated the Lofoten and Vester√•len islands fishing industry for centuries and is closely related to the old Viking longships.  Construction  The Nordland boat has a clinker, or lapstrake hull design and has its rudder on the sternpost. Its length varies from 14 to well over 40 feet and usually has a length to beam ratio of 3-1 to 4-1. It has a high prow and stern, shallow keel, v-hull and has an inboard gunwale, which can be used to drain off the fishing nets when they are drawn on board. Some of the larger Nordlanders have a detachable cabin that is used for shelter, often having a wood-burning stove inside.Christiansen (1968) p.85 The Nordlander normally carries a large single square sail with the largest boats carrying a topsail. It's one of the few types of boats that still carries such a sail to the present day. Oak had been a favorite wood for ship builders for centuries for its resistance to rot, strength, and durability. However, oak is not native to Norway north of the county of Tr√∏ndelag and is also a heavy wood which would make such boats difficult to pull up on shore, which was done on a daily basis. For these reasons, the materials used for the Nordland is almost exclusively pine, and in the northern regions, fir.Christiansen (1968), p.82-3 Pine and fir are lighter woods which would make it easier to be drawn up on shore, but at the expense of durability.  Sami versions  The Nordland boat has a very long history in the north Norwegian coastline, with both Norwegians and Sami, who are first recorded as sailing such boats from about 950 onwards. Around 1000 AD the Sami were described as producing Nordlandbots for their Norwegian customers along the northern coastal farming communities, which the Norwegians soon started to build for themselves.Olsen (2005) One of the biggest differences between the Norwegian and Sami built Nordlands is that the Sami 'sewed' the lapstrakes together using reindeer intestines, while the Norwegians used iron rivets. Nordland boats continued to be built for over 1,000 years, and in the early 20th century it was still used for fishing and coastal transport. The coat-of- arms of Nordland County, Norway is from modern times (1965).  Unique feature  One of the unique features of the Nordland is its ballast system. Dozens of fist size round rocks are placed at the bottom of the boat to keep the boat weighted down. In the event that the boat is either swamped or capsizes, the rocks are designed to roll out of the boat which would lighten the boat and thus keep it afloat.Wooden Boat Magazine, A Nordlandsbat for Maine: An American Sailor Orders a Norwegian Icon, March/April 2003  The Nordland Boat today  Nordland boats today are no longer used as primarily fishing boats but as pleasure craft and have annual races.\\"Treb√•tdagan p√• Rognan\\" (Boat Regalia at Rognan) http://www.hildringstimen.no Retrieved December 25, 2007 The coat-of-arms of Nordland County shows the traditional boat - the Nordlandsb√•t.

After the death of his father, the Zhenzhu Khan Yi'nan, he disputed with and killed his older brother, Yemang (ÊõµËéΩ), and became khan in 645. Then, reversing his father's peaceful policy with the Tang Dynasty, Duomi Khan immediately started incursions into their territory. This drew a heavy response from Emperor Taizong of Tang, who sent the generals Qiao Shiwang (Âñ¨Â∏´Êúõ), Zhishi Sili (Âü∑Â§±ÊÄùÂäõ), and Li Daozong to defend. They proved too strong for Duomi Khan's attacks, so he fled. But he did not live long. He was betrayed by his own vassal, Huige, who rebelled and killed him.

If locally powered, this can also be termed an active loudspeaker, meaning it contains an audio power amplifier that drives the loudspeaker. A network speaker implies the ability to send audio to such a device from a network connection, usually over an Ethernet network or the Internet. In many cases this type of speaker also contains digital signal processing (DSP) to provide the audio crossover and other tonal functions that exist in conventional speakers. Network speakers are also known as IP speakers. In many cases the IP speaker is created from an IP audio endpoint ‚Äî a device as described above with the requisite network connection and ability to process audio packets, but without the actual physical speaker portion ‚Äî that provides amplified audio to a conventional loudspeaker or unamplified audio (i.e. line-out) to an amplified speaker or system.  History  Network audio was first introduced in 1983 by John Detreville and W. David Sincoskie of Bell Labs in an IEEE paper \\"A Distributed Experimental Communications System\\". Subsequently, in 1988, Polle T. Zellweger, Douglas B. Terry and Daniel C. Swinehart of Xerox PARC introduced audio over Ethernet in Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE Conference, entitled \\"An Overview of the Etherphone System and its Applications\\". The very closely related technology (nearly synonymous), Voice over IP (VoIP), which generally consists at a minimum of a microphone on one end, a speaker on the other end, with a network connecting them; began widespread use in 1998 with PCs, followed shortly after by dedicated hardware (phones with built-in VoIP capabilities). Subsequently, the first Squeezebox, using networked audio, was released in 2001 and Philips released its IP audio device also in 2001, the FW-i1000. Countless IP audio devices have since proliferated into most major audio markets.  Designs  IP Multicast IP Unicast The audio content played by the processor in an IP speaker is communicated from its source across a packet-switched data network using IPv4 and IPv6 addressing with a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Real- time Transport Protocol (RTP). The IP Speaker connects to Unicast or Multicast addresses to enable the delivery of streamed data from a source on the network, to arrive at a single speaker or many speakers respectively.

The talks concluded with the signing of the Paris Agreements (Paris Pacts, or Paris Accords), which granted West Germany full sovereignty, ended the occupation, and allowed its admittance to NATO. Furthermore, both West Germany and Italy joined the Brussels Treaty on 23 October 1954. The Agreements went into force on 5 May 1955. The participating powers included France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, and remaining NATO members. Prelude Since the end of World War II, West Germany had been occupied by Allied forces and lacked its own means of defense. On 23 July 1952, the European Coal and Steel Community came into existence, bonding the member states economically. By 1951, fear of possible Soviet aggression in Europe led to preparation of an ill-fated European Defense Community (EDC). EDC was a proposed joint Western European military force, at the time favored over admitting Germany to NATO. The General Treaty () of 1952 formally named the EDC as a prerequisite of the end of Allied occupation of Germany. EDC was, however, rejected by the French National Assembly on August 30, 1954, and a new solution became necessary. London At the London Conference, often called the Nine-Power Conference (not to be confused with the Nine Power Treaty), it was agreed that the occupying powers would make every effort to end the occupation. The limits of German re-armament were also very important especially to France, which was still concerned with a powerful Germany. Belgium was represented by Paul-Henri Spaak, Canada by Lester B. Pearson, France by Pierre Mend√®s-France, Germany by Konrad Adenauer, Italy by Gaetano Martino, Luxembourg by Joseph Bech, the Netherlands by Jan Willem Beyen, the United Kingdom by Anthony Eden, and the United States by John Foster Dulles. Paris The powers met again in Paris on October 20‚Äì23, in an intergovernmental conference followed by a NATO Council meeting, to put the decisions reached in London into formal declarations and protocols to existing treaties. \\"Protocol No. I Modifying and Completing the Brussels Treaty\\" formally added West Germany and Italy to the Brussels Treaty, creating the Western European Union (WEU), which, while not as broad or powerful as the previously proposed EDC, nevertheless was sufficient for the Deutschlandvertrag to come into force and therefore to end the occupation of West Germany and admit it as an ally in the Cold War. Altogether there were as many as twelve international agreements signed in Paris. the Bonn‚ÄìParis conventions ended the occupation of West Germany and West Germany obtained \\"the full authority of a sovereign state\\" on 5 May 1955 (although \\"full sovereignty\\" was not obtained until the Two Plus Four Agreement in 1990). The treaty allowed Allied troops to remain in the country. An agreement expanded the Brussels Treaty of 1948 to include West Germany and Italy, creating the Western European Union. This agreement allowed West Germany to start a limited rearmament program though it banned development of certain weapons, such as large warships. It was signed by the Brussels Treaty countries (Belgium, France, Great Britain, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) and by West Germany and Italy. Another accord accepted West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The negotiations on Saar status, only between France and West Germany, were held on the night before the conference, on 19 October. The territory had been essentially annexed by France and a referendum was set up to determine the will of its people (the outcome was that Saarland rejoined West Germany in 1956-1957). On 27 October 1956 the Saar Treaty officially made Saarland a state of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Like all Frank stories, Frank in the River is virtually wordless and the story is conveyed entirely in pantomime. Publication history It was published by Tundra in 1992 in a special full-color issue of Tantalizing Stories, Tantalizing Stories Presents Frank in the River, and features Woodring's signature character, Frank. The special issue also included a shorter full-color story by Mark Martin featuring his character Montgomery Wart. Plot synopsis While trespassing inside an elaborate ornamental garden, Frank accidentally knocks over a huge statue, destroying it and part of a wall. Receiving a bill for the damages, he takes a job cleaning the inside and grounds of a large building which seems to be a palace. While he is cleaning he notices a red cistern in the center of one of the palace rooms. At the end of the day he is fed a meal of gruel by Manhog, who apparently is also a palace employee. The next morning a swarm of strange monsters clamber out of a nearby river and onto the palace grounds. Frank runs out to do battle with them, and by the end of the day has killed them all. He buries their corpses in a hole which he covers with a large rock. Cleaning up after the battle, he peeks in the cistern and finds a small figurine which resembles the statue he knocked over. At dinner Frank finds that Manhog has chopped up the remains of the monsters he killed and cooked them into a nauseating porridge. Rejecting the food, Frank goes to bed. That night Frank is awakened by a light turning on. Getting up, he sees Manhog moving around, and surreptitiously follows him down a long flight of stairs to an underground canal. Frank's attempts to find out what Manhog is up to are thwarted when he unexpectedly encounters a stop sign, which causes him to tear back towards his room in a panic. After catching his breath he looks in the cistern again, and finds a different figurine shaped like one of the monsters he fought earlier. Getting an idea, Frank makes a figurine that looks like himself and puts it in the cistern. Soon a small squad of Frank clones emerge from the river. The real Frank, pleased with himself, sits back and smokes a pipe, while Manhog is dismayed by the approaching clones. Manhog looks in the cistern and finds the Frank figurine, which he smashes on the ground in anger. Down in the mess hall the Frank clones wait expectantly for food. Manhog again serves up his same monster carcass porridge. Unlike the real Frank, the clones hungrily lap it up. When one of the clones bites down on a hard object in his porridge, all the clones are alarmed to see that it is the figurine of the destroyed statue. They chase Manhog back into the kitchen, where they are appalled to see evidence of the carnage that went into making their meal. The Frank clones seize both Manhog and the remaining monster carcasses and drag them into the river, where they all disappear. The real Frank, observing the scene from a telescope, is happy. He reclaims the statue figurine and puts it back in the red cistern. Having earned lots of money from the work he has been doing, he quits his job and goes to repay the owner of the garden, but the owner (unseen except for his hand, but apparently a normal human being) simply pats him on the head and allows him to keep the money. Frank goes to a real estate agent and buys himself a house, from which he can look out and see the place where he previously toiled. Collected editions Frank in the River is reprinted in the book collections Frank Volume 1 (1996, ) and The Frank Book (2003, ), both published by Fantagraphics Books. Reception Frank in the River was the first full-color Frank story by Woodring, and is still his longest color story to date. Its intense, luminous hues won Woodring the 1993 Harvey Award for Best Colorist, while the special issue it appeared in won the award for Best Single Issue or Story.\\"1993 Harvey Award Winners\\".

It is under the administration of the local government of Para√±aque City and is recognized by the Department of Education. The school offers scholarships to Filipino students who are gifted in the sciences and mathematics. Para√±aque Science High School is ranked the 2nd best school for providing quality education to high school students. It scored an 89.64 average on the National Achievement Test for the school year 2013-2014. National Achievement Test results for Para√±aque City Every January or February, PSHS accepts applications for the following school year. Foremost among its criteria for selection is being a resident of Para√±aque City. Other requirements include an average grade of 85% (with no grade lower than 85% in any grading period), belonging to the top 100 qualifiers in the entrance examination, and being able to pass the interview given by the head teachers and the principal of the school.  History  Para√±aque Science High School (PSHS) was concerned in 1988 by the late Mayor Walfrido N. Ferrer and his sister Mrs. Flor Cordero. It envisioned to provide free quality secondary education to the exceptionally bright elementary graduates of Para√±aque. It‚Äôs specially enriched curriculum in Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics. Their vision was referred to the Principal of Para√±aque Municipal High School (now Para√±aque National High School) Mrs. Rosa V. Sioson, with other school administrator: Miss Narcisa F. Catindig, Assistant Principal and Department Head of Mathematics; Mrs. Teresita Flores, Department Head of English; and Mrs. Elizabeth C. Cabales, Department Head of Science. This was approved by the Division Superintendent, Dr. Ricardo Sibug and the OIC Science Supervisor, Mr. Lino Rom, who signified their support to the notion. Their collaboration marked the birth of PSHS in 1990. With twenty-one (21) students housed in a borrowred classroom of PMHS, and teachers, supervised by the PMHS administrators, PSHS has proven its exceptionality. Under the administration of former Mayor Pablo R. Olivarez, the municipal ordinance 94-31 s.1994, \\"Authorizing the Creation and Operation of Para√±aque Science High School\\" was signed by the council on February 1, 1994; thus, the Para√±aque Science High School. This was housed in a building adjacent to the main building of PMHS. After a year, the staff of this school attempted to apply for nationalization but this was disapproved due to the policy of \\"no school within the school\\". In 2011, former Mayor Florencio M. Bernabe Jr. purchased a property in Barangay Sto. Ni√±o where a two-storey building with twenty-one (21) classrooms was constructed and was officially donated to Para√±aque Science High School on April 5. In May 2011, the whole staff of PSHS, headed by the principal Mr. Pablito S. Vibal, occupied this building. In August 1, 2013, another academic leader has been installed as the new principal of PSHS - Dr. Concepcion C. Bernaldez. She envisions greater structures that would make PSHS maintain its academic reputation and excellence not only as premier science high school in the city of Para√±aque but also in national arena.

Route description Also known as the Central Valley Expressway and the Emmett Highway, Highway 16 begins at the junction of US-20/US-26. It meets at a junction with State Highway 44, with Star to the West, and Eagle to the East. The highway continues north through Jackass Gulch and descends over 500 vertical feet (150 m) on the Freezeout Grade into the Emmett Valley. The highway then curves westward for a short distance, where it terminates at the junction with State Highway 52 just south of the Emmett city limits . History This route has been in existence since 1929. Originally, the alignment terminated in Horseshoe Bend. In 1938, the northern section of the alignment from Emmett to Horseshoe Bend was then replaced by State Highway 52. When this happened, the highway then realigned to the west, terminating in Payette. The route was truncated at its current terminus in Emmett in 1955 when Highway 52 was extended on to its northern section heading toward New Plymouth. While campaigning for a return to Congress in 1934, Robert McCracken died in an automobile accident on the highway in May, near Emmett. His vehicle went through a guard rail and tumbled down Freezeout Hill. Firebird Raceway opened in 1968 on the west side of the highway, between Star and Emmett. In December 2012, construction began on the 2.1-mile Boise River Bridge section between SH-44 and US-20/26. This 4-lane divided limited-access expressway opened to traffic on August 15, 2014. Future In 2007, plans are underway to extend State Highway 16 south of its current terminus to Interstate 84. A new interchange at the interstate is being studied as part of this plan, which will be built somewhere between Black Cat Road and Robinson Boulevard. The new highway is planned to be a 4-lane divided limited-access expressway or freeway. This project is part of the ITD GARVEE Transportation Program. The extension includes interchanges at Franklin Road, Ustick Road, Chinden Boulevard(US-20/US-26), and State Street(SH-44). The project is under design right now, and will go into effect in the next few years.

Early life and education  Bonnie Sherr Klein was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1941 to working class Jewish parents. She attended public schools until high school, when she then attended Akiba Hebrew Academy. She received a bachelor's degree in American studies at Barnard College, and became more active in the Civil Rights and anti-nuclear movements. After a year of teaching high school, she was admitted to Stanford University for their MA program in theatre. There, she attended a presentation by Claude Jutra and Marcel Carri√®re from the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). It inspired her to switched her major from theatre to film. Her thesis film, For All My Students, was completed under the supervision of visiting professor George C. Stoney, and was funded by the US Department of Education. Upon graduation, she was invited to New York to work on some of Stoney's film projects, and gained experience as a freelance editor. She and her husband, Michael Klein, immigrated to Montreal in 1967 as resisters to the Vietnam War. Soon after, she began to work with the NFB.  Career  John Kemeny hired Klein to work at the NFB's Challenge For Change program. One year later, he resigned and she recommended her mentor, Stoney, who led the program till 1970. In the Challenge for Change program, Klein co-directed Organizing for Power: The Alinsky Approach (1968), a five-part film series on community organizer Saul Alinsky. With Dorothy Todd H√©naut, she produced the first citizens' community video project, VTR St-Jacques. They provided equipment and training to residents of one of Montreal's poorest neighbourhoods to facilitate community dialogue and organizing. A short documentary was also produced by Klein and H√©naut. Other projects with Challenge for Change include Citizen's Medicine and Little Burgundy. In 1970, Klein moved to Rochester, New York, and, based on the Challenge for Change model, established Portable Channel, ‚Äúa community-access media and documentary centre‚Äù that was aligned with the guerilla television movement and funded by the New York State Council on the Arts. In 1975, she was invited by her Challenge for Change colleague, Kathleen Shannon, to join the newly formed Studio D, the women's unit of the NFB. As the only government-funded feminist film production agency, Studio D was committed to making films not just about women or by women, but also about social issues from women's point of view. Klein, an avowed feminist, was one of the first film directors assigned to the studio by the NFB. However, due to shortage of funds for the studio and internal politics, she spent a lot of time organizing training programs, developing film series, and advocating for feminist film productions. ‚ÄúStudio D was a total integration of film and the movement. We were inspired by and inspired the movement,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúIt was really heady. Intellectually it was incredibly stimulating. Every idea was a new idea. Discovering the patriarchy behind every corner. The whole movement about violence against women was unheard of. It was just a soup that was constantly bubbling.‚Äù In 1981, Klein made what is probably her best-known film, Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography. It went on to become one of the most popular and commercially successful films the NFB ever made. In 1987, Klein suffered a catastrophic stroke caused by a congenital malformation in her brainstem. She became locked-in, quadriplegic, respirator-dependent, and experienced panic attacks. She spent more than six months in hospital and another three years in formal rehabilitation. She went on permanent disability pension from the NFB and began her work in disability activism, as told in her memoir Slow Dance: A Story of Stroke, Love and Disability (1997) which she co- authored with writer and artist Persimmon Blackbridge. She writes, speaks, consults, and counsels on issues of disability; in particular access, health care, and representation. In 1998, she co-founded kickstART: Disability Arts and Culture, and they held their first festival in 2001. Klein's most recent film is Shameless: The ART of Disability (2006). She is featured in the film, along with poet and writer Catherine Frazee, humourist David Roche, dancer and choreographer Geoff McMurchy, and Persimmon Blackbridge. Vancouver musician Veda Hille contributed music for the film.  Honours  Klein received a lifetime achievement award from Women in Film and Television Toronto and a Governor General's Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case. She was named a YWCA Woman of Distinction in 1996. In 2012, she was invested as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2012. In his remarks, the Governor General of Canada said, \\"Bonnie Sherr Klein has used her talents to shed light on social issues and to give voice to the voiceless.\\" She received two honorary Doctor of Law degrees from Ryerson University in 2003 and from University of British Columbia in 2014.  Personal life  Klein and her husband, Michael, immigrated to Canada in 1967 as resisters to the Vietnam War. The pair have two children.  Praise and criticism  Klein's film Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography (1981) was instrumental in launching a fierce public debate on pornography across Canada. In 2015, the Toronto International Film Festival screened it as part of their Open Vault series and stated \\"it remains both timely and essential viewing today.\\" She has been described as \\"a radical icon\\" and \\"a groundbreaking filmmaker\\" by Point of View Magazine. Reflecting on his time at the NFB, George C. Stoney noted \\"The two women who persuaded us to launch our first community videotape project were no ordinary film-makers. Dorothy H√©naut and Bonnie Klein brought to the task a philosophy about democratic participation that shaped every aspect of the work, from the way to run training classes to the way editorial decisions are made. It is largely their concept, their way of working, which guides social animators, teachers and community leaders generally who are now applying Challenge for Change techniques across Canada.\\"  Filmography  * 1965‚Äì1966 Community Mental Health Series (three docu-dramas) * 1966 For All My Students * 1966 Last- Chance Children * 1966 One Fine Day * 1968 Challenge for Change * 1968 Introduction to Fogo Island * 1968 Little Burgundy * 1968 Organizing for Power: The Alinsky Approach.

He was the son of classical scholar John Henry Wright and novelist Mary Tappan Wright, the brother of geographer John Kirtland Wright, and the grandfather of editor Tappan Wright King. Life and family Wright was born in Hanover, New Hampshire. He married, November 14, 1912, Margaret Garrad Stone. They had four children, William Austin, Sylvia, Phyllis, and Benjamin Tappan. The family lived successively in Berkeley, California, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wright died as a result of an automobile accident near Santa Fe, New Mexico, on September 18, 1931. He was survived by his wife, children and brother. Education Wright entered Harvard College in 1901, graduating with an A.B. degree in 1905. He enrolled in the Harvard Law School in 1906, interrupting his course of study there to attend Oxford University for a year in 1906‚Äì1907 before returning and graduating cum laude with an LL.B. degree in 1908. He was on the editorial staff of the Harvard Law Review during his last year at Harvard. Professional career From 1908‚Äì1916 Wright worked for the law firm of Brandeis, Dunbar and Nutter in Boston, after which he taught at the School of Jurisprudence at the University of California, Berkeley from 1916‚Äì1924. His teaching work was interrupted by a period in which he worked as assistant counsel to the U.S. Shipping Board and U.S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation in San Francisco in World War I. He also practiced law with the San Francisco law firm of Thatcher and Wright after the war, from 1919‚Äì1924. From 1924 until his death in 1931 Wright taught at the University of Pennsylvania. He also taught at Stanford University in 1922, the University of Michigan in 1924, and the University of Southern California in 1931 as a visiting or acting professor. The subjects he taught included Agency, Common Law Procedure, Partnership, Corporations, Damages, Persons, Admiralty, Mortgages, Municipal Corporation, Military Law, and Torts, his own main interests being in Corporation Law and Admiralty. He published extensively in various legal journals, particularly the California Law Review and the University of Pennsylvania Law Review. Literary career Although Wright's professional colleagues were aware he had literary interests outside his field and some anticipated he might eventually branch out into other areas of literature, these possibilities appeared precluded by his early death. During his lifetime he published just one work of fiction, the short story \\"1915?\\" in the Atlantic Monthly for April, 1915. Few people outside Wright's own family knew he had long been working on an extensive Utopian fantasy about an imaginary country he called Islandia, with an elaborately worked-out history, culture and geography, comparable in scope to J. R. R. Tolkien‚Äôs life-long writings of Middle-earth. In his papers he left a 2300-page manuscript of a novel exploring the country, with appendices including a glossary of the Islandian language, population tables, a historic peerage, and a gazetteer and history of each of its provinces. Another book-length manuscript purported to be a general history of the country. After Wright‚Äôs death his widow typed and edited the manuscript for publication, and following her own death in 1937 their daughter Sylvia further edited and cut the text; the novel Islandia, shorn of Wright‚Äôs appendices, was finally published in 1942, along with a promotional pamphlet by Basil Davenport, An introduction to Islandia; its history, customs, laws, language, and geography, based on the original supplementary material. Islandia became a cult classic and ultimately spawned three sequels by Mark Saxton. Papers Wright‚Äôs papers, including carbon typescripts of the uncut version of Islandia and the unpublished Islandia: History and Description, Dreams and Other Verses, college writings, and letters to family members, are in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Some of his wife‚Äôs correspondence is in the Fay family papers at Radcliffe College.

The church is a Gothic Revival structure and has a towering steeple, flanking spires, and an assortment of stained glass. History In 1861 St. Louis Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick invited the Redemptorists, a missionary congregation that was founded by Saint Alphonsus Ligouri in 1732, to establish a permanent presence in the city of St. Louis. The community accepted the invitation and lived in temporary housing until 1866 when they bought at Grand and Cook Avenues. Ground for the church was broken on May 1, 1867, and the cornerstone was laid on November 3 of the same year by the Rev. Joseph Melchers, the vicar general of the archdiocese. The church's Gothic Revival design is attributed to the Rev. Louis Dold, C.Ss.R., working with St. Louis architects Thomas Waryng Walsh and James Smith. Construction on the church continued until 1872 and Archbishop Patrick J. Ryan dedicated the church that year. The church's spire, which reaches , was completed in 1893. The first Mother of Perpetual Help Shrine in the church was blessed on December 7, 1873, during the first public triduum under her name. The church ceased being a mission church in 1881 when it became a parish of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, although it remained under the pastoral care of the Redemptorists. The Redemptorists' St. Louis Province was headquartered in the residence from its founding until the mid 20th-century. There were two noteworthy visitors to the community in the 19th century. The year the property was bought in 1866 Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos visited while on a missionary preaching trip a year before his death. The Rev. Augustus Tolton, the first African-American Catholic priest, said Mass for the School Sisters of Notre Dame in the convent‚Äôs chapel in 1887. The parish has grown over the years to become a predominantly African-American church in St. Louis. The church was struck by lightning on August 16, 2007, sparking a fire that damaged the roof and leading to water damage when the fire was put out.Jeremy Kohler. \\"Fire guts 'Rock' Church.\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

This novel is the second installment of the Greenwich Village Shared World Trilogy, with Chester Anderson writing the first book (The Butterfly Kid) and the third volume (The Probability Pad) written by T.A. Waters. Kurland, Anderson, and Waters wrote themselves as characters in each book.  Plot summary  Michael is watching Chester's band performing in San Francisco in the 1960s, where he meets the girl of his dreams, Sylvia. She tells Michael she needs help finding her unicorn, Adolphus. After Michael and Chester get to know her, Sylvia explains that she lost Adolphus after she had gotten off of the train. Chester and Michael remember that the last train in their area ran 6 years ago. Sylvia explains that she is from the circus and her crew is looking for Adolphus. She got separated from them after she took a winding road. Sylvia asks Chester to play \\"Barkus is Willing\\" while she calls Adolphus because he is fond of woodwind music. When Sylvia sees cars, she doesn't know what they are. Chester and Michael start to wonder if time travel is involved in how Sylvia came to be with them. While searching by a forest, they meet Sylvia's circus friends - Ronald, Arcturian, and Dorothy. The groups decide to split up to search for Adolphus. Sylvia reveals she is from 1936. While in the forest they see a UFO. As it's beginning to move closer, they run away. The UFO disappears in sections and the whole group goes through a blip. They leave the woods they were in and appear in another forest, where they discover a yellow brick road. Sylvia starts crying because going through the blip made her sick. Sylvia reveals that she has been through a blip before, when she was on the train in her own time, that's how she ended up in Michael and Chester's time. Sylvia hears Dorothy signalling her with a whistle, and whistles back to alert Dorothy of where they are. Dorothy reunites with the group after she hears Sylvia's response. They decide to follow the yellow brick road, where Chester notices the deliberate order of the nature around them and realizes that they're in a garden. A horse-drawn carriage approaches them, and a man named Robin gets out of it to speak with the group. Chester assumes they've been transported into Early Victorian Era. Robin's Aunt, who is traveling with him, and Robin offer the group a ride. (This universe was inspired by Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy) On their journey with Robin, they run across an orgy in the grass alongside the road, but unlike Sylvia, Michael, Dorothy, and Chester, Robin and his aunt cannot see the orgy. They reach a town called West Mutton and Robin and his aunt offer them a place to stay at the suite they reserved. They have dinner and get introduced to many Victorians, and all the maids begin to take off their clothes. None of the guests notice the maids, even when they steal jewelry from them. The Victorians accuse the group of stealing the jewelry, so the group begins to flee. They realize that if they remove their clothes, no one can see them, so they do so. Sylvia ends up kissing Michael, and they run to the train to escape the angry mob. Another blip happens while they're on the train, jumping them into another time. In this world, they get stuck with an army troop that demands that Michael and Chester leave Sylvia and Dorothy behind, or else they'll kill them. Sylvia jumps on the commander and kills him, urging the others to launch an attack on the rest of the troop - killing all of them. After looking at the troops, they realize that they've been transported again, this time into a Nazi war zone. Chester and Dorothy are killed by a Tiger tank in the fight. While trying to escape the Nazis, Sylvia and Michael are blipped to a circus, where they run into Tom. After Sylvia and Michael explain what's happened, Tom realizes they blip in moments of crisis. They proceed to crash a circus performance and blip over a lake. Once they get out of the water, they're summoned by soldiers to meet Lord Gart. The New England government is suspicious of all the travelers coming to their area and want to learn more about it, so the group decides to meet with them so they can trade information. They're asked to record all of their travels and then meet with Lord Gart for dinner. They learn that, in this universe, magic is real. They are asked to do experiments to recreate the feeling of blipping with Sir Thomas. New England is experiencing an exponential increase of visitors from other worlds and the government is worried that an ending is coming. They finally find Sylvia's unicorn, Adolphus, in this world when he is brought to them. Chester and Dorothy, no longer dead, find Michael. After talking about their experiences, the group concludes that Chester and Dorothy didn't actually die - the Chester and Dorothy of that other world did. After two weeks, Sir Thomas discovers that all worlds from all universes are merging into one. He tells them they have to destroy a machine to stop the blips and everyone will return to their original world. Michael and Sylvia learn that if they tightly hold hands, they may be able to return to the same world. They blip again to a world filled with dinosaurs, but Chester falls into a beam of light in the process. Reality begins to break apart and Sylvia yells for her and Chester to hold hands, but they don't make it in time. Chester, Tom, and Michael are transported back to their timeline without Sylvia, Dorothy, and Adolphus. Back in his own time, Michael Kurland asks Sir Thomas to contact him through his website or email.

Anderson was a poet in the Greenwich Village; Kurland had recently returned from traveling with the United States Army in Europe. The pair decided to abandon their previous career goals and become science fiction authors. Kurland was influenced by his group of friends, all of whom bore unusual names, such as Bob \\"The Pope\\" Silverberg and Willy \\"The Professor\\" Ley. Together Anderson and Kurland wrote Ten Years to Doomsday, deliberately emulating the style of Poul Anderson. The book was published by Pyramid Books; Ed Emshwiller illustrated the cover. Anderson subsequently wrote The Butterfly Kid, basing the hero and sidekick on himself and Kurland and telling the story from the perspective of the character Chester. He suggested Kurland write the sequel. Kurland's original idea was to retell the story from the perspective of the character Michael, rather than telling a story that followed that of The Butterfly Kid, but eventually settled on writing a more traditional sequel instead.  Reception  James Nicoll reviewed the book, stating that it was \\"exactly the cheerful light comedy it set out to be\\" and noting that \\"Somewhat atypically for the time, the two women in the group‚ÄîSylvia and Dorothy‚Äîmanage to kick serious ass.\\"  References  Category:1969 American novels Category:1969 science fiction novels Category:Novels by Michael Kurland ","title":"The Unicorn Girl"},{"id":"13886758","title":"Party of the Roma"},{"id":"13886773","text":"Gallimard NRF) The Misunderstanding (French: Le Malentendu), sometimes published as Cross Purpose, is a play written in 1943 in occupied France by Albert Camus. It focuses on Camus‚Äô idea of The Absurd. A man who has been living overseas for many years returns home to find his sister and widowed mother are making a living by taking in lodgers and murdering them. Since neither his sister nor his mother recognize him, he becomes a lodger himself without revealing his identity. Plot summary Act 1: The reception hall of a small boarding house, noon Martha and her Mother, together with a taciturn Old Man, run a guest-house in which they murder rich solitary travellers. Martha wants to get enough money to go and live by the sea. Mother is exhausted by killing. Jan returns to the house he left 20 years ago. He has heard his father was dead and has returned with money for his mother. He expected to be welcomed as the prodigal son, but his mother does not recognise him. His wife Maria says a normal person would simply introduce himself, but Jan intends to observe his family from the outside and find what they really need to make them happy. Maria reluctantly agrees to leave him there for one night. Jan registers under a false name. Martha is cold and refuses to answer personal questions. Mother fails to respond when Jan hints at his purpose in coming and asks if she had a son, but she begs Martha not to kill him. Act 2: The bedroom, evening Martha warms slightly towards Jan, but when he becomes interested in her she rejects the shared moment and determines to kill him. She brings him a drugged cup of tea. Mother tries to retrieve the tea but is too late. Jan tries to express his feelings to her, but Mother replies impersonally. When Jan falls asleep, Martha takes his money and they prepare to throw him in the river. Act 3: The reception hall, morning In the morning, Martha is happy but Mother just feels tired. The Old Man finds Jan‚Äôs dropped passport and they realise without emotion what they have done. Mother decides to drown herself, disregarding Martha‚Äôs protests. Martha is left alone with her anger. Maria arrives, looking for her husband. Martha first says he has left, but then admits they drugged and drowned him for his money, saying it was ‚Äúa slight misunderstanding‚Äù that led her to kill her own brother. Maria is distraught. Martha coldly compares it to her own loss of her mother. Then realising she is alone she decides to kill herself. She tells Maria to pray God turns her to stone or kill herself too, then leaves the house. Maria prays for mercy and the Old Man appears. Maria asks for help but he bluntly refuses. Origin Camus wrote Le Malentendu in 1942 and 1943 in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in Nazi-occupied France. Originally the play was to have been entitled Budejovice after the city ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice in Czechoslovakia where Camus stayed briefly during a European trip with his first wife in 1936.Williams, Christopher. The Misunderstanding and Caligula: two plays by Albert Camus, translated by Christopher Williams. Knocklofty Press, Tasmania, 2007. The play ‚Äúis a highly subjective presentation by Camus of the human condition as he saw it in the desperate circumstances of 1942-43‚Äù.Freeman, E. The Theatre of Albert Camus: A Critical Study. Methuen, London, 1971 It reflects several aspects of Camus‚Äôs life: he had left Algeria, to which he was deeply attached, leaving his second wife and friends behind; he was depressed with tuberculosis; as well as living under threat of execution as a propaganda agent of the French Resistance. Camus once described Le Malentendu as ‚Äúthe play that resembles me the most‚Äù. The plot of Le Malentendu resembles the newspaper article that the protagonist of Camus' 1942 novel The Stranger finds under his mattress in his prison cell: it is the story of a man who became rich abroad and comes home to his village where his sister and mother have a hotel. He doesn't reveal his identity (in order to surprise them later), and books a room as a guest. Because he is wealthy, his mother and sister murder him while he is asleep. The plot is also an ironic reversal of the classical theme of the recognition of the brother, from the ancient Greek Electra plays and the New Testament story of the Prodigal Son. Style Le Malentendu ‚Äúis austere in its plot and characterization and claustrophobic in mood‚Äù. Camus ‚Äúdeliberately contrived an effect of polished, articulate, non-colloquial discourse‚Äù, as in a classical tragedy. Through the necessity of writing while under occupation, ‚Äúthe play is cloaked in metaphor, trailing a train of symbols, with Camus styling the drama with all the inevitability of a Greek tragedy. In the Greek style, each character gives the argument for his or her actions, whether for good or ill. Thus Camus is able to air his thoughts on innocence, grief, guilt, betrayal, punishment, integrity, and silence, wrapping all these in what is essentially an existential debate. Although Camus' arguments come thick and fast, the play moves at a deliberate pace as it develops into more of a treatise than an organic drama\\".Levett, Karl. ‚ÄúThe Misunderstanding‚Äù, 3 Nov 2009 ‚ÄúIt is the most poetic of all the works Camus wrote for the stage, but one cannot claim that speech and situation always match perfectly‚Äù.Petersen, C. Albert Camus, Frederick Ungar, New York, 1969 The characters ‚Äúunwittingly express ambiguities that escape their awareness‚Äù, and indirectly express philosophical ideas. Le Malentendu is ‚Äúso heavily laden with ambiguities and multiple levels of meaning that it borders on caricature, a fact that may explain its relative failure as a tragedy‚Äù.Hopkins, P. ‚ÄúCamus‚Äôs Failed Savior: Le Malentendu‚Äù, Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature, vol 39, no 4 (1985), pp251-256 Themes Camus‚Äôs theme is ‚Äúthe sauveur manqu√©, a savior who fails because of his inability to speak a clear language to those he would save‚Äù. Le Malentendu ‚Äúdepicts the destruction of a family fatally incapable of communicating with each other‚Äù.Lea, Simon. ‚ÄúCross Purpose‚Äù. The Camus Society, 2012 Jan does not heed his wife Maria when she advises him to introduce himself plainly. His sister Martha accepts nothing but impersonal communication. Mother is too weary to respond to Jan‚Äôs hints. The play contrasts the love between Jan and his wife with the absence of love from his sister and mother. Mother‚Äôs suicide when she realises her crime deprives Martha of the maternal love she also needs. Maria‚Äôs wish for divine love is also denied. ‚ÄúOne of the most important themes is the impossibility of attaining happiness‚Äù. Despite the success of his marriage, Jan cannot be happy in exile, but wishes to return to his family and be happy together. Martha also longs to be somewhere else, and Mother longs for peace, but these desires are only met in death. The misunderstandings and lack of comprehension that thwart these desires illustrate Camus‚Äô philosophy of the Absurd. These difficulties create the drama ‚Äì Jan‚Äôs choice to conceal his identity, Martha‚Äôs insistence on impersonal conventions, her misinterpretation of his determination to stay, Maria‚Äôs bewildered response to her cold confession, and the Old Man‚Äôs indifference. When Camus revised the play in 1958, he added or modified four very short incidents to transform the indifference of the Old Man into something more sinister. For example, he distracts Martha when she is about to check Jan‚Äôs passport. Camus aimed to ‚Äúintensify the effect of unrelieved metaphysical blackness, culminating in the very last crushing syllable of the play: ‚ÄòNon!‚Äù‚Äù. The play expresses an antipathy to religion, but also a strong concern with religious ideas, including the parable of the prodigal son. ‚ÄúCamus had never cut himself off from conversation with Christian thinkers but stood in a relation of tension to Christianity‚Äù.Marie, C.P. ‚ÄúA Re-examination of Form and Meaning in Camus' Le Malentendu‚Äù, Nottingham French Studies, vol 17(1978), pp60-73. The return of Jan from happiness in Africa to a murderous home, and the yearning of Martha to be in the sun, reflect an antithesis between Northern Europe and the Mediterranean, which informs all of Camus‚Äô work. It is interesting that very similar theme is treated by a Macedonian playwright Risto Krle in his play Money is Murder (–ü–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ —Å–µ –æ—Ç–µ–ø—É–≤–∞—á–∫–∞) written in 1938.http://www.org.mk/struga- heritage/tekst.asp-lang=eng&tekst;=52.htm Philosophy \\"The vision is bleak, with Camus' absurdist creed summed up by one of his characters: 'This world we live in doesn't make sense'\\" Le Malentendu ‚Äúfocused on Camus‚Äô idea of the absurd. The core of this idea is that human desire is in perpetual conflict with a world that is arbitrary, illogical and unfair. A central theme of this play is that life does not distinguish between those who pursue a ‚Äòbad‚Äô path and those who pursue a ‚Äògood‚Äô path. Life, as Camus sees it, is equally cruel to the innocent and the criminal; this is the absurdity of existence‚Äù ‚ÄúIn The Myth of Sysiphus, Camus defines 'The Absurd' ‚Ä¶ as the feeling of being radically divorced from the world and thus a stranger to both others and oneself. The sense of constantly living in a state of exile produces a profound skepticism or distrust in the myths and universal systems of belief, which are alleged to give meaning and purpose to existence but in fact devalue and even negate it‚Äù Kritzman, L.D., Reilly, B.J. & DeBevoise, M.B. The Columbia History Of Twentieth-Century French Thought, Columbia University Press, 2007, p465 ‚ÄúAlthough seen by a number of critics as a bleak piece of work, Camus did not regard Le Malentendu as pessimistic. He said: ‚ÄòWhen the tragedy is done, it would be incorrect to think that this play argues for submission to fate. On the contrary, it is a play of revolt, perhaps even containing a moral of sincerity‚Äô‚Äù It implies that everything would have worked out all right if Jan had done what his wife begged him to do, or if Martha had responded to Jan‚Äôs personal questions or Mother had remembered when asked about her son. The family is destroyed through ‚Äúfailing to realise that values are not dreamed up in isolation but discovered communally‚Äù. ‚ÄúCamus himself remarked that he considered the play to have been a failure for the simple reason that everybody he met kept asking him what he meant. If they needed to ask, he argued, then the play itself was not clear, and he had not been successful as a playwright‚Äù.Thody, Philip, cited by Marie 1978 Performance history Le Malentendu was staged for the first time at the Th√©√¢tre de Mathurins in Paris on 24 August 1944, directed by Marcel Herrand, who also played the part of Jan and with Maria Casar√®s as Martha. The performance coincided with the Liberation of Paris. The play had two short runs, neither particularly successful. It was the first of Camus' plays to be performed, although Caligula had been written two years earlier. ‚ÄúThe French public were ill-prepared in 1945 to appreciate such multi-faceted allegories and such philosophical implications in the absence of rational cogency and psychological realism. In a word, the play was felt to be lacking in logic. Its tragic tone, its refinement, its poetic presentation were no compensation to the audience which insisted ‚Äì particularly in those days ‚Äì on clarity of statement and precision of thought‚Äù. In 2012, a production of Cross Purpose, was performed in English at the King's Head Theatre, London. Produced by AM Media Productions, Jamie Birkett starred as Martha with Christina Thornton as Mother, David Lomax as Jan, Melissanthi Mahut as Maria and Leonard Fenton as the Old Man. The production was revived in 2013 with Paddy Navin as Mother and Kemi-Bo Jacobs as Maria. It was directed by Stephen Whitson with set design by Jenny Gamble, costume design by Ilona Russell, sound design by Tim Adnitt and lighting design by Phil Hunter.

Route description State Highway 44 starts at the junction of Interstate 84 north of Caldwell at Exit 25. The highway heads eastward staying mostly to the north of the Boise River. The highway goes through the cities of Middleton and Star. Just to the east of Star meets its junction with Emmett Highway, SH-16. Highway 44 continues east through Eagle and intersects with State Highway 55. From Eagle eastward, the highway is also known as State Street and continues toward Boise. The highway turns southward onto Glenwood Street in Garden City where it continues for approximately before ending at Chinden Boulevard (US-20/US-26). History This route is believed to have been in existence since 1934. A previous alignment of State Highway 44 continued eastward down State Street past Glenwood Street further into downtown Boise. The highway turned south onto 23rd Street and continued several blocks to Fairview Avenue which, at the time, was also US-20, US-26 and US-30.

Course and Characteristics =Kaweka Forest Park= Floating through the native forest of the upper MohakaUp in the Kaweka range the Mohaka is a twisting grade II river with a bit of grade III. There are several Department of Conservation (DOC) campsites, hot pools and plenty of undisturbed native bush.Charles, G.(1996).New Zealand Whitewater 4th Ed.Nelson, New Zealand:Craig Potton Publishing. After approximately 36 km, it comes out of the Kawekas and farmland becomes more commonLand Information New Zealand.Kaimanawa[Map].1:50 000.Topographic Map 260-U19. New Zealand: Land Information New Zealand, 1999. The river bends itself into an oxbow and shortly after rapids become larger as it leads into the grade III section. DOC campsites are still found along this 68 km stretch.Land Information New Zealand.Te Haroto[Map].1:50 000. Topographic Map 260-V19. New Zealand:Land Information New Zealand, 2000. =Everett's Camp to Te Kooti Bridge= As the more technical grade III rapids begin the river flows past native bush of the Tataraakina block on the left and Waitere Station on the right. This section contains Te Hoe‚Äôs rapid, which is the largest and longest in this section. There are 3 gorges to be appreciated on this run.Waterfall halfway down Long Rapid, Grade V Section =Te Kooti Bridge to Willow Flat= Te Kooti‚Äô s bridge marks the start of the grade V and the end of the grade III. After the bridge, it is an easy grade II float for about 4 km then the banks get steeper and the rapids start off with the largest one on the river, Long Rapid. Scenery on this stretch includes massive boulders, waterfalls falling from the steep canyon walls and fascinating erosion patterns created by the water on the soft stones. The rapids are continuous for the full 18 km with the grade being mostly III+ with some exciting IV/V. =Willow Flat to Mohaka Township= Where the Mohaka meets the ocean The final stretch of the river after the grade V returns to grade II as it mellows and flows into the ocean. More steep walled banks of river and side creeks can be seen down this section as they cascade down, creating substantially high tiered waterfalls and smaller side gorges. The vegetation changes to become more lush, featuring silver fern or punga, eventually easing off to cleared farm land towards the oceanSurvey and Land Information.Mohaka[Map].1:50 000. 260 W19. New Zealand: publisher and date unknown. Flow Water level is usually highest in the spring, dropping naturally throughout the summer but can rise quickly in heavy rains. Slips are common and trees can sometimes be found drifting or jammed between boulders. There is an automatic river gauge which posts water level information (NIWA) or contact the local rafting companies for current conditions. Geology Big boulders creating rapids on the Grade 5Much of the Mohaka runs through sedimentary rock. In the upper sections, greywacke commonly forms the steeper banks with smaller stones and shingle forming shallow beds and beaches. Conglomerate, sandstone and limestone begin to dominate the banks and large boulders create the rapids down through the grade III section.Lee, J.M.;Bland,K.J.;Townsend, D.B.;Kamp, P.J.J(compilers) 2011:Geology of Hawke's Bay Area. Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences. 1:250 000.Geological Map 8 1 sheet+93p. Lower Hutt, New Zealand. GNS Science.Canyon on the Grade 5House Rock Moving closer to the grade V section, the boulders become larger and the banks narrow into a deep gorge. Large conglomerate blocks form the first rapid then the river eases into a sedimentary rock canyon. The boulders, while impressive in size, are even more intriguing because of the holes and depressions the water has carved into them. House rock worth a closer look; the center has been carved out and is accessible only by a hole in the side. Fossilized shells and organic matter have been remarkably well preserved in the stones. After the Willow Flat Bridge, the size and frequency of large boulders decreases to be replaced by steep vegetation covered terraces. Sandstone and mudstone become more prevalent as the river approaches the ocean, as does farmland. Approximately seven fault lines cross the Mohaka river. Most are found in the upper section but the most obvious to untrained observers is found just above a rapid called Red Rock in the grade III section. It becomes apparent a fault has been crossed as the type of rock changes almost instantly. Recreation Kayaking on the Grade 5 sectionCommercial rafting is run on all sections of the Mohaka. Most sections can be run as a day trip or sections can be combined into multi day adventures.Mohaka Rafting.(n.d.).mohakarafting.co.nz.Retrieved Jan. 19, 2014 from http://mohakarafting.com. The Mohaka offers something for any level of kayaking. Beginners will find plenty of eddies and waves on the grade II sections while intermediate kayakers will find the grade III more challenging. The grade V is a technical run for more advanced kayakers. Local rafting companies have the most up-to-date information and can often assist in setting up a shuttle. Fishing between the rapids of the Upper SectionThe upper section is the most popular destination for fishing in Hawke‚Äôs Bay. Trout is a common catch, along with various varieties of native fish. Mainly brown trout are found above Pakaututu bridge and rainbow trout below.Kent.J. (2006). ‚Äò‚ÄôNorth Island Trout Fishing Guided‚Äô‚Äô. (pp.169‚Äì172) China: Reed publishing Ltd. Fishing is not as good on the lower sections but the rapids are more exciting and challenging. Hiking is popular along the upper section. Trails lead to the hot springs and access the river in various places along the way. They are maintained by the Department of Conservation.Department of Conservation.(n.d.).

The genetic basis of coat colour in the Labrador Retriever has been found to depend on several distinct genes. The interplay among these genes is broadly used as an example of epistasis. Background Labrador Retrievers are a popular dog breed in many countries. There are three recognised colours, black, chocolate, and yellow,Carol Coode, Labrador Retrievers Today, Howell Book House: New York, 1993. that result from the interplay among genes that direct production and expression of two pigments, eumelanin (brown or black pigment) and pheomelanin (yellow to red pigment), in the fur and skin of the dog. The recognized colours are due to two genes, while a third gene affects the range of colouration observed within the yellow Labrador. These individual genes do not act independently of each other, and their interaction in affecting the trait of coat colour is used to demonstrate the genetic principle of epistasis, where multiple genes react synergistically to affect a single trait.Jane B. Reese et al., Campbell Biology, 9th Ed., Benjamin Cummings, Boston, 2011, p. 273. The genetics of mammalian colouration has been studied in detail, and similar mechanisms have been identified across many species. For this reason, much of the early work on the colouration of dogs in general and Labradors in particular have relied heavily on analogy to the traits characterized in mice and other mammals.Christopher B. Kaelin and Gregory S. Barsh, \\"Genetics and Pigmentation in Dogs and Cats\\", Annual Review of Animal Bioscience, 1: 125-156 (2013) Initial genetic studies of coat colour in dogs published in the 1950s concluded that there were two main genes involved, one distinguishing blacks from browns, and the other distinguishing blacks from reds and yellows.O. Winge, Inheritance in Dogs with Special Reference to the Hunting Breeds, (Ithaca, NY: Comstock Publishing, 1950)C. C. Little, Inheritance of Coat Color in Dogs, (Ithaca, NY: Comstock Publishing, 1957)Sheila M. Schmuts, Tom G. Berryere and Angela D. Goldfinch, \\"TYRP1 and MC1R genotypes and their effects on coat color in dogs\\", Mammalian Genome, 13: 380-387 (2002) A 1977 study using crosses within a population of purebred Labradors showed the involvement of two specific genes in production of the three main coat colours of Labradors and described the underlying genetics of these colour varieties. Genes for black, chocolate, and yellow colouration =Eumelanin colour= Labradors showing the two eumelanin colour phenotypes: Black (BB,Bb) and chocolate (bb). The three recognised colours of Labrador Retrievers result from differences in two genetic loci that affect pigment expression. The first of these affects the colour of the dark pigment, eumelanin, and is referred to as the B (brown) locus. The variation displayed by this locus is observed in many mammals, reflecting a so-called 'dilution', a lightening, of black eumelanin to a brown colour. Initial genetic research excluded a role for the melanocortin 1 receptor and the Agouti locus as being the cause of the black dilution trait in dogs.J.A. Kerns, M. Oliver, G. Lust and G. S. Barsh, \\"Exclusion of Melanocortin-1 Receptor (Mc1r) and Agouti as Candidates for Dominant Black in Dogs\\", Journal of Heredity, 94: 75-79 (2003) Instead, TYRP1 (tyrosinase related protein 1) was found to be responsible. This enzyme is localised to melanosomes, the cellular organelles that produce and store pigments, and serves to catalyze oxidation of eumelanin precursors. In dogs, three mutations in the TYRP1 gene have been identified, one resulting in a truncation of the protein, the other two leading to an amino acid deletion or a single amino acid substitution in the sequence of the protein. All of these mutations are found across the range of dogs, and hence are thought to have preceded the divergence of distinct breeds, and all three are found within Labrador Retrievers. Each of the mutations appears to eliminate or significantly reduce enzymatic activity, and the colouration phenotypes (the visible traits) produced by the three mutations are indistinguishable. These represent recessive mutations in the TYRP1 gene, and since mammals have two copies of each gene, one from each parent, an animal with at least one copy of the fully functioning TYRP1 protein (represented as 'B') will display the dominant trait, black pigmentation, while to display brown pigmentation, both copies of this gene must be mutant alleles (collectively represented as 'b'). Thus a dog with the genotypes BB or Bb will express black eumelanin, while brown eumelanin will be seen in dogs with the bb genotype. = Eumelanin distribution = Yellow Labrador with the recessive (ee) and black Labrador with dominant (EE or Ee) phenotype for the expression of eumelanin pigment in the fur. A second gene affects whether these eumelanin pigments will be expressed in the fur or solely in the skin. Called the 'extension' (E) trait, this is directed by the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). This receptor signals the pigment-producing cell in response to melanocortins and results in deposition of eumelanin into the hair. Mutations in this protein have been shown to be involved in pale or red colour phenotypes in a range of species, including humans, horses, pigs, cattle, mice, fur seals, mammoths and the Kermode bear, as well as colouration in whiptail lizards. In most dogs, activity of MC1R is modulated by two signaling molecules, a repressor that is a product of the Agouti gene (A locus), and an activator, Œ≤-Defensin 103 (CBD103), recently named the K locus. In Labradors a highly-active mutated version of the K gene, (KB) is invariant, producing uniform eumelanin distribution independent of the Agouti genotype and leaving differences in MC1R to mediate the sole variability of this signaling pathway.Ruvinsky, A., Sampson, J. The Genetics of the Dog, 2001, Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK, ebook. A recessive mutation in this E gene truncates the protein, producing a non-functional receptor incapable of directing eumelanin deposition in the fur. Among dogs, this mutation is unique to yellow Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers and is thought to have arisen in the retriever population before these individual breeds became distinct. The exact mutation has also been found to underlie the colouration of white coyotes found around Newfoundland, having apparently passed into that population through interbreeding with a Golden Retriever. As with the B locus, presence of a single copy of the functional receptor gene ('E') will result in the dominant phenotype: presence of eumelanin in the fur. If both copies of this gene are the recessive mutated variant ('e'), the dog will have no eumelanin in its fur. Such a dog will appear yellow, with eumelanin evident only in the skin of the nose, lips, eye rims and foot pads, of a colour determined by the B locus. A variant of the functional MC1R allele that produces a facial 'mask' in other breeds of dogs (Em) is also present in Labradors, but since the colour of the mask is determined by the B locus, in Labradors the mask this gene produces is indistinguishable from the overall coat colour.E. K. Conant, R. Juras, and E. G. Cothran, (2011) \\"Incidence of the mask phenotype M264V mutation in Labrador Retrievers\\", Research in Veterinary Science 91: e98-e99 = Eumelanin gene interactions = The interplay between these two genes determines the colour of a Labrador Retriever, and is widely used as an example of epistasis. If a dog possesses the dominant phenotype for the extension allele (genotype EE or Ee), then it will display the fur colouration determined by its brown locus genotype, while a dog with the recessive extension trait (ee) will have a yellow coat with either black (BB, Bb) or brown (bb) exposed skin. This results in the three coat colours seen: 600px *Black Labradors can have any genotype with at least one dominant allele at both the B and E loci: BBEE, BBEe, BbEE, or BbEe. *Chocolate Labradors will have a genotype with at least one dominant E allele, but must have only recessive b alleles: bbEE and bbEe. *Yellow Labradors with black skin pigment will have a dominant B allele but must have recessive e alleles: BBee or Bbee. *Yellow Labradors with pale or chocolate pigment, or an absence of skin pigment, can have only recessive alleles at both loci: bbee. These dogs are often referred to as Dudleys, and are disqualified in the showring, although are eligible for registration under current standards. Aging-related declines in eumelanin production can cause the exposed skin in a Labrador with black skin pigmentation begin to appear lighter, but Dudley dogs have this colouration throughout their lives. These genes assort independently, so a single genetic cross involving two black Labradors each with a recessive allele at both the B and the E locus (BbEe) has the potential of producing all of the possible colour combinations, while crosses involving chocolate dogs can never produce black (there being no dominant B allele in either parent) but can give rise to yellow. Yellow Labradors will breed true with regard to fur colour but those with black skin can potentially produce a Dudley. Dudleys breed true for both fur and skin. The ability of the E locus to override the coat colour directed by the B locus is a classical example of epistasis, where multiple genetic loci affect the same observed trait. In a study of Labrador retrievers in the United Kingdom, it was found that chocolate labradors had a shorter average lifespan than either black or yellow labradors. They were also found to suffer from more skin and ear disorders. It is unknown whether this is a direct consequence of their melanin genotype, or is due to other recessive genes, amplified through the inbreeding used to propagate the chocolate phenotype. Pheomelanin in yellow Labradors Colour variation within yellow Labradors due to differences in pheomelanin expression. The E locus also determines whether the phenotype due to the third genetic locus affecting coat colour will be evident. This locus is recognised as affecting coat colour through the expression of pheomelanin, the pigment responsible for red and yellow pigmentation. The effects on pheomelanin pigmentation are only seen if there is no eumelanin expressed in the fur, else the dark eumelanin will mask any pheomelanin present. Thus these differences are visible only in yellow Labradors, which as a result range in colour from light cream to copper-red. It had long been thought that the genetic locus for this trait was the same seen regulating pheomelanin in other mammals, subsequently identified as tyrosinase. This enzyme makes both eumelanin and pheomelanin, and when subject to a knockout mutation results in albinism. A less extreme mutation of the same tyrosinase gene, the so-called Chinchilla trait, produces a dilution that selectively affects pheomelanin alone, similar to the phenotype observed in yellow Labradors. Thus, as with Chinchilla-related pheomelanin dilution in other species, this trait in yellow Labradors has been represented by the letter C. However, genetic analysis of the inheritance of coat colour in yellow Labradors has shown that the locus responsible is entirely distinct from the Chinchilla trait of the tyrosinase gene, and likewise is distinct from SLC45A2,Sheila M. Schmutz and Tom G. Berryere, The Genetics of Cream Coat Color in Dogs, Journal of Heredity, 98: 544-548 (2007) the so-called cream gene responsible for the dilution of pheomelanin in buckskin, palomino and cremello horses and also for the absence of pheomelanin in the white tiger,Xiao Xu, et al., The Genetic Basis of White Tigers, Current Biology, 23: 1031-1035 (2013) while a mutation in SLC7A11 found to cause pheomelanin dilution in mice was not found in a survey of cream-coloured dogs.S. M. Schmutz and T. G. Berryere, Genes affecting coat colour and pattern in domestic dogs: a review, Animal Genetics, 38: 539-549 (2007) The gene responsible for colour variation within the yellow Labrador remains unidentified, but the variation it causes is formally recognised as part of the normal pigmentation spectrum seen within the breed. A pattern of incomplete dominance is observed: individuals with two copies of the more active allele (CC) would be the darkest, those with one copy of each (Cc) would be intermediate, and those having two copies of the lower-expressing version (cc) would be the lightest. The dilute gene in the Labrador Retriever The silver Labrador is not a formally recognised colour variety. A lilac (diluted chocolate) Labrador The American Kennel Club (AKC) and other kennel clubs around the world recognize three coat colours in the Labrador: black, yellow and chocolate. In recent years, other colours have become more prominent in the breed through cross breeding with other breeds. Breeders refer to these colours as 'silver', 'charcoal' and 'champagne'. These dogs typically have a metallic-looking sheen to the hair. These are conformation disqualifications within the breed and are linked with a skin disease known as Color Dilution Alopecia. The gene affecting this colour variation in all dog breeds is the recessive 'dilution' (D) locus. It is possible for each of the standard colour genotypes to be diluted if the dog carries two copies of the recessive dilute allele, dd. Dogs that carry at least one D will not have a diluted coat. If two dogs carrying the Dd genotype are bred, diluted offspring could be produced.Coode, C. 1993. Colour Inheritance. Labrador Retrievers Today. Howell Book House, New York. 28-32. Studies have linked the diluted trait to a mutation in the melanophilin (MLPH) gene. The dilution factor was not originally a visible part of the genetics of Labrador Retrievers, and therefore, controversy surrounds the topic.Kurtz, K. 2013. Genetic aspects and controversies of coat color inheritance in the Labrador retriever. Animal Science 314, Michigan State University. Novel pigmentation can arise through long-masked recessive traits being brought to the fore by inbreeding to select for other traits, through undisclosed outbreeding with other breeds to introduce novel traits, or through spontaneous mutation. There are many breeders in the United States who specialize in breeding these diluted Labradors. The standard for Labrador Retriever does not include dilution colours, and stipulate that any dilute is a breed disqualification, although the American Kennel Club will register purebred Labs that are dilute in colour under the colours of black, yellow or chocolate.Vanderwyk, Jack 2012. Analysis of the ‚Äòsilver‚Äô Labrador population. https://web.archive.org/web/20170724123017/http://labradornet.com/silverlabsanalysis.html The Labrador Retriever Club, Inc. states that there is no silver gene in pure- bred Labrador Retrievers. However, the American Kennel Club has maintained that their registry is based on parentage, not colour. Mosaics and other \\"mis-marks\\" Labrador pup with white face and chest markings characteristic of its ancestor, the St John's water dog. At least one example of a Labrador Retriever mosaic for pigmentation has been described. This male dog exhibited random but distinct black and yellow patches throughout his coat. He was the result of a black female heterozygous for yellow (B_Ee) bred to a yellow male (B_ee), and was mated with Labradors of each of the recognised colours. The resulting puppies were all consistent with the inheritance pattern of a yellow Labrador with black pigment. The most probable cause was either a somatic mutation early in development or a fusion between two zygotes that left some cells with genetics capable of producing dark fur, and others including the reproductive cells incapable of doing so. Other ‚Äúmis-marks‚Äù such as brindle, tan points, white spots, and rings around the tails are not uncommon in Labradors. Each of these conditions have various underlying genetic as well as environmental causes.

Origins and mana  Aside from other connections, he was Ngati Tautahi. His mother was Te Auparo and his father Te Maoi; his brothers the chiefs Moka Te Kainga-mataa and Rewa and sister, Te Karehu. Both Te Auparo and Te Karehu were killed by a Ngare Raumati raiding party and their bodies eaten. The women were working in a keha (turnip) plantation. The war cry \\"Patukeha\\" was used when the raupatu was ordered. Te Wharerahi married Tari, the sister of the Hokianga chiefs Eruera Maihi Patuone and TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene. Tari, Patuone and Nene were all children of the NgƒÅti Hao chief Tapua and his wife Te Kawehau. In one sense, the marriage of Te Wharerahi and Tari cemented an alliance between a key hapu of the Bay of Islands and the Hokianga, just as the marriage of Tapua and Te Kawehau had done.  Musket Wars  Te Wharerahi and his two brothers Rewa and Moka 'Kainga-mataa' participated in the bloody Musket Wars of the 1820s-1830s, which caused wholesale destruction across the North Island; resulting in numerous deaths, imprisonment, and the displacement of a large number of people. Te Wharerahi took part in numerous battles, such as Mokoia, Te Totara, and Matakitaki. (Elder, 1932, p. 342; & Percy Smith, 1910, pp. 218‚Äì343).  Role and stance on the Treaty of Waitangi  Te Wharerahi and his two brothers were original signatories to the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand signed at Waitangi on 28 October 1835, which guaranteed the MƒÅori chiefs their sovereignty with this document being officially recognised by the Crown in 1836. A few years later, the Crown could see the benefits to the British Empire in gaining sovereignty over these islands and in 1839, would decide to attempt to annex New Zealand. The Crown decided to achieve this by introducing a new document which would in effect, revoke the Declaration of Independence. Captain William Hobson was sent to New Zealand with the express aim, of ensuring that this was achieved and arrived in the Bay of Islands aboard on 29 January 1840. A week later, on 5 February 1840, the three brothers attended a large hui at Waitangi (400 people) where they had an opportunity to speak publicly about the agreement which would become known as the Tiriti o Waitangi or Treaty of Waitangi. Rewa and Moka vigorously opposed the signing, whilst Te Wharerahi sided with the Crown. Rewa informed Hobson that they did not need the Crown as they were their own rulers, they held sovereignty over New Zealand, and told Hobson to go back to England. Moka then addressed Hobson and questioned him about the proclamation that he was witness to at the Christ Church on 30 January 1840 and doubted Hobson's ability to effectively enforce Crown control. Moka then publicly challenged the Reverend Charles Baker as to the land Baker had acquired and after receiving what he believed to be an unsatisfactory or unconvincing answer, accused the Europeans of being deceitful.\\"Moka Te Kainga-mataa\\", nzhistory.net.nz Later in the proceedings, \\"...Wharerahi, one of the most important and senior of the northern alliance chiefs, and older brother of Rewa and Moka...now spoke in support of it [Treaty]....He was the first chief to appeal to the idea that having the governor would assist in the creation of peace between the tribes...\\" (Phillipson, 2004, p. 247). Wharerahi said: \\"Is it not good to be in peace? We will have this man as our Governor. What! turn him away! Say to this man of the Queen, Go back! No, no.\\" (Colenso, 1890, p. 23). According to Salmond (1997) '...this speech by a very powerful rangatira marked a shift in opinion at the hui.' (Phillipson, 2004, p. 247). Hokianga chiefs; Eruera Maihi Patuone and his brother TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene, would join Wharerahi and show their support toward the Crown, by arguing for them to remain in New Zealand. The following day, a number of chiefs including Te Wharerahi, decided to sign the Treaty and although Rewa held reservations, eventually he too would sign. However, it appears as though Moka refused to sign this document on principle. There are a number of interesting dynamics here; Te Wharerahi was brother-in- law to TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene and Eruera Maihi Patuone (both of which wished for peace) whilst there is a suspicion that Rewa and Moka may have been close to the Bishop Pompallier, who spoke against the signing of the Treaty to some of the MƒÅori chiefs. William Colenso, the CMS missionary printer, in his record of the events of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi gives an example of Bishop Pompallier's activities with a statement of the chief Te Kemara, when he signed the Treaty: \\"[a]fter some little time Te Kemara came towards the table and affixed his sign to the parchment, stating that the Roman Catholic bishop (who had left the meeting before any of the chiefs had signed) had told him \\"not to write on the paper, for if he did he would be made a slave.\\" References Category:New Zealand MƒÅori people Category:1770 births Category:19th-century deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Year of death unknown Category:Musket Wars Category:Treaty of Waitangi Category:People from the Bay of Islands ","title":"Te Wharerahi"},{"id":"13887051","text":"Albert Holden Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth PC (25 May 1865 ‚Äì 23 January 1942), was a British businessman and Liberal politician.

Its main campus is in Barbados, and separate administrative offices are located in Iselin, New Jersey, and Miramar, Florida, in the United States. Prior to 2018, its main campus was in Portsmouth, Dominica but moved to its present location in Barbados in 2018.https://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/breaking-news-ross- university-to-leave-dominica/ It is owned by Adtalem Global Education Inc., formerly DeVry Education Group, which purchased it in 2003. History The medical school was founded in 1978 as The University of Dominica School of Medicine by Robert Ross, an entrepreneur. At the time, it was housed in leased facilities at The Castaways Hotel, with an inaugural class of 11 students. In 1982, the University of Dominica School of Medicine formally changed its name to Ross University School of Medicine at the request of the government of Dominica. In 1985, California state medical licensing officials (the Board of Medical Quality Assurance), began investigating RUSM, along with other medical schools located in the Caribbean. The officials released a report stating that RUSM had nearly no admissions standards, and that the school was in the business of providing medical degrees to \\"everyone that wants one.\\" RUSM agreed to implement a number of changes recommended by the board and has since graduated over 11,000 practicing physicians. In the late 1990s, RUSM expressed interest in opening a U.S.-based medical school in Casper, Wyoming, but accreditation was denied by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the organization that accredits MD-granting medical schools in the United States. Some local individuals welcomed the economic impact of a new medical school on the town, but critics questioned the quality of education at a for-profit institution. In 2003, RUSM was acquired by DeVry Education Group, which has since renamed itself Adtalem Global Education. In 2017, RUSM hired a PR firm, Edelman, to enhance its image. Later that year, the school was impacted by Hurricane Maria, when the Category 5 storm made landfall on the island of Dominica. The hurricane knocked out communications, effectively isolating RUSM from the outside world. The campus suffered moderate damage from the effects of Maria. Students and faculty were located through a university-initiated roll call, and then were evacuated from the campus to the U.S. mainland. In October 2017, the university announced that classes for the fall semester would resume mid-October aboard the GNV Excellent, an Italian ferry that would be docked off the coast of the island of St. Kitts. The ship was reconfigured as an educational venue. In November 2017, Ross University School of Medicine relocated temporarily to Knoxville, Tennessee, for continuation of medical school classes. Lincoln Memorial University (LMU), based in Harrogate, Tennessee, and with operations in Knoxville, provided the operational capacity and the technical capabilities to support RUSM faculty, students, and staff. Ross University School of Medicine permanently relocated from Dominica to Barbados for the beginning of the 2019 Spring semester due to extensive damage done at the prior campus in Dominica after Hurricane Maria. International medical education collaborations Ross collaborates with Dillard University, Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, and Tuskegee University to educate more African- American doctors in the United States of America. Accreditation According to the university's website, RUSM is accredited and recognized by the following agencies: *National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFMEA) through the U.S. Department of Education, allowing American students to participate in the U.S. Federal Direct Student Loan Program *Barbados Medical Council (BMC) *Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (CAAM-HP) *General Medical Council of Great Britain The university also has state-specific accreditation from California, New York, New Jersey, and Florida. Campus The Ross University School of Medicine pre-clinical campus is located at the Lloyd Erskine Sandiford Centre at Two Mile Hill in Barbados. The campus features a medical and anatomical imaging laboratory, a simulation center, and classrooms equipped with several plasma screens and projection equipment, similar to the previous campus in Dominica. =Housing= The university does not offer traditional dormitory housing options. Most students typically live in off- campus university-approved housing complex within The Villages of Coverley, which features has 2 bedroom, 3 bedroom, and 4 bedroom houses. Curriculum RUSM accepts students for three different entering classes per year: September, January and May. The fall entering class is typically the largest each year. Since September 2010, the university has followed an organ systems- based curriculum for its basic sciences. This is divided into two different tracks, known as \\"Accelerated Curriculum\\" and \\"Curriculum\\" as of May 2013. The accelerated curriculum track covers the basic sciences in 60 weeks of study (four semesters), while the Curriculum track covers the same material in 75 weeks (five semesters) with integrated study breaks. Both tracks share identical first semesters, allowing students more time to decide on the track they wish to pursue. =Clinical training= Unlike many American medical schools, Ross University does not own or affiliate with any particular primary teaching hospital. The university contracts with hospitals throughout the U.S. to accept and place students in clinical rotations. The Bakersfield Californian reported that Ross and Kern County in California agreed to a $35 million deal to enable Ross students to complete clinical rotations at Kern Medical Center. Upon completion of the curriculum, similar to that of U.S. medical schools, students must pass the USMLE Step 2 CS and USMLE Step 2 CK, prior to graduation. =Internal Medicine Foundations (IMF)= Prior to starting clerkships for the third and fourth years of the MD program, students must complete an eight-week clinical semester known as Internal Medicine Foundations (IMF) at the Cleveland Clinic Hospital located in Weston, Florida. Successful completion of this pre-clinical program is required prior to entry into a clerkship. =Clerkships= The university requires students to enter into \\"track\\" programs for clerkships, which would have most students complete core rotations at a single teaching hospital affiliate. The clerkship component of the program is currently composed of 48 weeks of required core rotations and 30 weeks of electives. Students have the option to enter clerkships in the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom. RUSM has \\"leveraged residencies\\" in which it pays hospitals to accept their students for clinical clerkships. Academic outcomes According to the US Department of Education, 64.4% of students completed the program on time in 2017.https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/ross-university-school- medicine.pdf In 2016, the university reported a residency match rate of 86% among first-time eligible applicants. In 2016, the university reported first- time pass rates for the USMLE Step 1, USMLE Step 2 CK, and USMLE Step 2 CS were 93%, 87%, and 94%, respectively. RUSM has a self-reported USMLE Step 1 first-time pass rate of 96%. Student loan debt According to the US Department of Education, the median student loan debt for US students is $334,740. Alumni Since opening in 1978, over 13,000 students have graduated from the university. * Henry Bello ‚Äì shooter in the Bronx Lebanon Hospital attack on 30 June 2017 * Nicole Saphier * Michael R.

Plot summary Martin Barth is a very rich man with a serious overeating problem. When his obesity interferes with his enjoyment of his lifestyle, he goes to a secret clinic, gets himself cloned and then transfers his memories into the clone. After Barth has legally transferred his identity to his replacement and it is too late to change his mind, he is told that he is now the property of the company that runs the clinic. His name is now \\"H\\", because he is the eighth \\"edition\\" of himself to go through the process. He has a choice: immediate death or \\"an assignment\\". Since he doesn't want to die he agrees to work for the company. He is dragged to a camp in the middle of nowhere and forced to do manual labor so that he will be in shape for the unspecified job they want him to do. After two years, with only a brutal overseer for company, \\"H\\" is given his assignment. He leaves the camp, just in time to see his clone \\"I\\" - who is now fat - dragged into the camp to begin the process over again. As his plane is taking off, \\"H\\" thinks about how much he hates himself for repeating this process over and over again. He wishes that the newest clone would suffer even more than he had. After telling this to the businessman, who is his new supervisor, the young man laughs out loud.

Plot summary An entire species of aliens fleeing from a doomed planet sends an agent ahead to the planet Earth to prepare the way for the arrival of their minds, the only part of themselves they have been able to preserve. Since killing another sentient species is against their moral code, their agent decides that the most common and widely beloved non-sentient species on the planet, dogs, are to serve as the new vessels for his fellow aliens' minds. This he arranges for them by designing and selling a small solar power plant‚Äîdisguised as a doghouse‚Äîthat produces enough energy to serve the needs of an entire household with plenty to spare. This product is wildly successful, and soon there are more than enough doghouses with dogs in them to accommodate his people. When he brings his people into their new home, however, neither he nor his people have the foresight to realize that humanity is too blinded by its egotism ever to see its dogs as anything but pets. As such, he has doomed them all to the horrible fate of never being allowed to be anything but servants to the dogs' owners, since the humans are not aware of the aliens' intellectual superiority.

He is best known for taking part in talks with Richard Cumberland in a failed attempt to arrange a peace treaty between Spain and Britain during the American War of Independence. Early life Hussey was born at Ballybogan, County Meath in 1746. Due to the restrictions of the Penal Laws, Hussey went to the Irish College at Salamanca for his religious training, and joined the Trappists upon completion of his studies.O'Donoghue, David. \\"Thomas Hussey.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 21 December 2017 Diplomatic career Given Hussey's ability, the Pope requested him to take Holy Orders. Hussey was associated for a time with the court of the King of Spain, and soon became prominent in Madrid. Around 1767 he was appointed chaplain to the Spanish embassy in London. In 1793-96,Dates according to Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840, 3rd ed., s.v. Joseph Bonomi. shortly after the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 repealed some of the laws affecting Catholic worship, a chapel, St James's, Spanish Place, was built to designs by Joseph Bonomi. Hussey became rector of the chapel. Embassies which maintained their own Catholic chapels provided a safe place for the London Catholic community to worship, and many of them had a number of English-speaking chaplains on staff.Mulhall, Daniel. \\"Dr Thomas Hussey, an Irish Bishop and a Spanish diplomat in London\\", Irish Embassy, London When the Spanish ambassador had to leave London because Spain took sides against England during the American War of Independence, Dr. Hussey became Spain's unofficial diplomatic contact with England. Following discussions with the government of Lord North, Hussey was sent to Madrid to discuss Spain's withdrawal from the American cause. Upon his return to Madrid, he attracted the notice of English Catholics in exile, and was deputed by the English Catholics to go to Rome to lay their position before the pope, but the Spanish embassy would not grant him leave of absence. He was befriended by Irish born politician Edmund Burke while in London. Hussey was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1792.Dr Thomas Hussey DD FRS (1741-1803) Maynooth and Waterford George III, Pitt, and the Duke of Portland entrusted him with a mission to the Irish soldiers and militia in Ireland who were disaffected, but when he heard their grievances, he pleaded in their behalf much to the distaste of the Irish executive. When he returned to Ireland, Hussey played a role in the establishment of Maynooth College, and became its first president in 1795.Webb, Alfred. \\"Bishop Thomas Hussey\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, Dublin. M.H. Gill & Son, 1878 In 1797, he became the Bishop of the Diocese of Waterford and Lismore. Despite his earlier protest at Catholic soldiers being obliged to attend Dublin Castle services, the Protestant authorities honoured his consecration at St. Nicholas of Myra church in Dublin with the presence of an armed detachment. He attracted widespread attention in 1797 by issuing a pastoral letter to his clergy, strongly resenting Government interference in ecclesiastical discipline and the proselytising of Protestants in Ireland through the establishment of religious schools. Death and burial Tombstone of Thomas Hussey Hussey officially opened the first monastery and school of Edmund Ignatius Rice at Mount Sion in Waterford on July 7, 1803. By now in his mid-50s and in poor health, Hussey then settled his estate and had his will drawn up, which amongst other things dealt with the upkeep of Edmund Rice's education of Waterford's poor boys, and ensured the survival of his fledgling religious congregation. After signing the will on July 10, Hussey went on a holiday to nearby Dunmore East. The next morning, he went with Dean Hearn for a swim, but suffered an apoplectic fit and never regained consciousness. Hussey's remains were brought back to Waterford for burial, but his funeral became the focus of sectarian violence. During the funeral procession to the Great Chapel, the coffin and Hussey's mourners were set upon by a group of drunken soldiers returning from an Orange Order meeting. These men abused the mourners and attempted to throw Bishop Hussey's remains into the River Suir that runs through Waterford.

She is neither rich nor poor but somewhere in the middle. She is the middle child in her family and lives between her two sisters who live thirty leagues to the north and to south of her. One day while traveling to see one of her sisters she meets a dragon on the road. He tells her that he will either eat her or grant her three wishes. She decides to take the three wishes and then wishes that her husband‚Äôs farm will produce enough food to support her family forever. The dragon flies to her house and eats her family so that no matter how much food the farm produces it will always be enough. Realizing that the dragon only wants to trick her, the woman wishes that everything in the world would go back to the way it was before she left her house that morning. Instantly she is back in her home and decides not to go see her sister so that she will not meet the dragon again. Although she is now safe, it occurs to the woman that she still has one wish. However, she wisely decides not to use it. Instead she saves it for a day when she needs it.

The model is often characterized as being a local and transparent organization composed of delegates bound by mandates. These delegates would be recallable at any time from their positions. Proponents view the right of recall as a particularly important safeguard against corruption and unresponsiveness among the representatives. Introduction Almost universally, socialists, communists, and anarchists have seen the Commune as a model for the liberated society that will come after the masses are liberated from capitalism, a society based on participatory democracy from the grass roots up. Marx and Engels, Bakunin, and later Lenin and Trotsky gained major theoretical lessons (in particular as regards the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" and the \\"withering away of the state\\") from the limited experience of the Paris Commune. Nonetheless, these very advocates provided critiques of the commune. Marx found it aggravating that the Communards pooled all their resources into first organizing democratic elections rather than gathering their forces and attacking Versailles in a timely fashion. Many Marxists, based on their interpretation of the historical evidence and on Marx's writings on the subject, believe that the Communards were too \\"soft\\" on the non-proletarian elements in their midst. But the idea of the commune as a libertarian social organization has persisted within revolutionary theory. Kropotkin criticized modern representative democracy as merely being an instrument for the ruling class, and argued that a new society would have to be organized on entirely different principles which involved every individual more directly.Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets (1970), Dover Publications. He treats the nation state as a capitalist territorial organization which imposes itself over many communities through the spectacle of participation which elections deceptively provide. Communes on the other hand are expected to endow communities with autonomy from external powers and offer each person within them a part in decision- making processes, through communal assemblies and easily revocable delegates. Within Marxism Karl Marx, in his pamphlet The Civil War in France (1871), written during the Commune, advocated the Commune's achievements, and described it as the prototype for a revolutionary government of the future, 'the form at last discovered' for the emancipation of the proletariat. Thus in Marxist theory, the commune is a form of political organization adopted during the first (or lower) phase of communism, socialism. Communes are proposed as the proletarian counterpart to bourgeois political forms such as parliaments. In his pamphlet, Marx explains the purpose and function of the commune during the period that he termed the dictatorship of the proletariat: Marx based these ideas on the example of the Paris Commune, which he described in The Civil War in France: In addition to local governance, the communes were to play a central role in the national government: Bakunin's Revolutionary Catechism Bakunin eventually diverged sharply both personally and ideologically from Marx and such a divergence is evident in his thought. Bakunin never advocated a dictatorship of the proletariat, but instead a collectivism based on communes and cooperative worker's associations allied together into a decentralized and stateless federation. In his Revolutionary Catechism he laid down the principles on which he believed a free, anarchist society should be founded upon. This included the political organization of society into communes: The autonomous commune is furthermore based upon the complete liberty of the individual and dedicated to its realization. Bakunin's anarchist commune is not organized into a dictatorship of the proletariat but a loose, yet cohesive federation that attempts to achieve the aims of the actively revolutionary class as a whole. The function of mini-communes Jeff Shantz points out in his book Constructive Anarchy: Building Infrastructures of Resistance, in hopes of mass communes one day being a reality, that \\"Mini-communes and squats exist all over the world, but comprise only a marginal pattern of social organization in relation to society at large. However, many of them provide a self-conscious example of how a socialist society would function, even if only on a microsociological level. As they are, socialist mini-communes are, along with workers' associations, the germs for the development of mass, socially complex communist communes.\\".Shantz, Jeff (2010) Constructive Anarchy: Building Infrastructures of Resistance This hypothetical is an example of what organizations like workers-organizations could lead to if brought to sufficient scale. In the case that this gradual progression is true, it would have implications both on the way that workers-organizations and their like are perceived both by those who hope for mass communes to be a reality and those who do not. For those who support communes, it would motivate them at a policy-level to encourage workers-organizations, for those who oppose communes, it would encourage them to abolish workers-organizations at every opportunity. The idea that workers- organizations gradually progress into communes, thus brings into question whether or not workers-organizations are fundamentally healthy or destructive in their long-term function. It is important to note at this point, that some do believe that workers-organizations are part of an inevitable progress towards mass-communes.

A slave woman of African descent, Anastacia is depicted as possessing incredible beauty, having piercing blue eyes and wearing an oppressive facemask. Although not officially recognized by the Catholic Church, Anastacia is still an important figure in popular Catholic devotion throughout Brazil. She is also venerated by members of the Umbanda and Spiritist traditions. She has also been portrayed in Brazil in books, radio programs and a highly successful television miniseries bearing her name.  History of the Saint  Without an official history, stories of Anastacia's life vary. Some place her birth in Africa, where it is stipulated that Anastacia was the child of a black, female slave from the west coast of Africa. Her mother was raped by her owner- and Anastacia was the result -the first black child to be born with blue eyes. The plantation owner had the baby sent away, to hide the evidence of his ‚Äòinfidelity‚Äô from his wife. Others, on the other hand, emphasize her Brazilian origins where she was born in Africa, a Royal Princess who was enslaved and shipped to Brazil. According to Carlos de Lima, a Brazilian historian, the enslaved Princess became a housekeeper on a sugar came plantation. In all versions she is enslaved and cruelly treated by her enslavers. Anastacia stoically bears these traumas and treats all people with love. She is often purported to have possessed tremendous healing powers and to have performed other miracles. Eventually, she is punished by her owners by being forced to wear a muzzle-like facemask, which prevents her from speaking, and a heavy iron collar. The reasons given for this punishment vary: some stories report her aiding in the escape of other slaves, others claim she resisted rape by her master, and yet another places the blame on a mistress jealous of Anastacia's beauty. After a prolonged period of suffering, all the while performing more miracles of healing and peace, Anastacia dies of tetanus from the collar. It is often claimed that she healed the son of her master and mistress, and forgave their cruelty as she died.  History of veneration  While there are reports of black Brazilians venerating an image of a slave woman wearing a facemask throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, the first wide-scale veneration of the Saint began in 1968 when the curators of the Museum of the Negro, located in the annex of the Church of the Rosary of the Brotherhood of St. Benedict in Rio, erected an exhibition to honor the 80th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in Brazil. Among the displays was an engraving of a female slave wearing a punishment facemask. The image soon became the object of popular devotion and members of the Brotherhood began collecting Anastacia stories in the early 1970s. In the 1980s, the cult of Anastacia expanded from her original, poor, black base to include many progressive, middle-class whites. In 1984, an effort funded by the oil company Petrobras to officially canonize Anastacia brought her considerable attention. Seen as a symbol of racial harmony, her popularity expanded rapidly, especially among nurses, black women and prisoners. There were radio dramatizations of her life and on television a popular miniseries and investigative reports were produced. She was also integrated into the Umbanda faith as one of the pretos velhos, \\"old black slaves\\". In 1987, the Catholic Church declared that Anastacia never existed and her image was removed from Church-owned properties. However, by this time, several independent shrines had been erected in Rio which exist to this day. = Veneration today = Like other Saints, devotion to Anastacia is a deeply personal experience amongst those who venerate her. The primary arena of this devotion is the use of small images‚Äîlike prayer cards, medallions, statuettes, candles, etc.through which the devotee prays for Anastacia to intercede on her behalf. Many also say prayers to Anastacia in times of difficulty or crisis. Often, devotees respond to intercessions by pilgrimage to one of several popular shrines. Here small offerings like flowers, jewelry, prayer cards and medallions are given to the image of the Saint.  Mini-series  In 1990, a mini-series entitled \\"Escrava Anastacia\\" was produced for Brazilian television. Directed by Henrique Martins, written by Paulo C√©sar Coutinho and starring √Çngela Correa, it portrayed Anastacia as a Nigerian princess captured by slavers. Anastacia is sold to a cruel master who falls in love with her and eventually tries to rape her. For refusing her master, Anastacia is punished by being forced to wear a face mask. The image of Anastacia healing the son of her oppressors is an innovation developed for this program.

This long structure was finished in 1975 to replace a 1907 bridge at the same location and carries rail traffic for the Portland and Western Railroad. The original bridge was built to carry the Oregon Electric Railway across the river near the Boones Ferry. History The first bridge was built in 1907 for the Oregon Electric Railway line that ran from Eugene to Portland. That bridge was a steel, long structure slightly downriver from the Boones Ferry crossing at a section of the Willamette that runs east-west between Canby and Newberg. Known as the Oregon Electric Wilsonville Bridge, the bridge had a southern approach consisting of a wooden trestle measuring more than in length. This trestle caught fire in July 1939. In 1954, the ferry was discontinued when the Boone Bridge opened to carry U.S. Route 99, now Interstate 5. Ownership of the rail bridge passed to the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway in 1910, and in 1970 it became part of the new Burlington Northern Railroad (BN). In 1972, initial plans for a new bridge were approved by the Coast Guard and construction began on August 1, 1973. Hensel Phelps Construction Company built the new bridge for Burlington Northern, which included constructing new piers in the river. The bridge was completed in July 1975, and opened for rail traffic on August 6, 1975. The rail line was leased to Portland and Western in 1995, which they then bought the tracks in 1997. The land and bridges underneath the tracks of the line were donated to the state by Burlington Northern in 1998. Details Located upstream from the old ferry landings, the bridge is at river mile 38.8. Built of two steel thru trusses each long, the total span is long. This type of truss allowed the new bridge to sit lower than the previous bridge, as the bridge's structure sat above the tracks, whereas the old bridge's girders were located below the track level, and thus the entire bridge needed to be higher in order to allow river traffic to pass. The old bridge stood tall. The structure is supported by four concrete piers in the river, three piers on land, and two abutments. Carrying a single track on a concrete deck, the bridge includes six deck girder spans used on the approaches. The black-colored bridge was designed and built by Hensel Phelps Construction. Constructed of weathering steel, the bridge superstructure is oxidized, which prevents rust. It also means the bridge does not need to be painted.

It appears in his short story collection Maps in a Mirror, but it originally appeared in the July 1977 fine arts issue of Ensign magazine under the pen name Byron Walley. It is Card's first published work.Lifetime Achievement Awards: Orson Scott Card and Susan Elizabeth Howe, by Andrew Hall, at the Association of Mormon Letters; published April 8, 2017; retrieved May 31, 2017 Plot summary A clumsy and imaginative thirteen-year-old girl named Susan Parker is having a very bad day. At school she pokes one of her classmates with a pencil and breaks her teacher's fishbowl. At home things get worse - she continues to make mistakes, knock things over and get into trouble. Although her parents are patient with Susan, she becomes convinced that they all hate her. Upset with herself, Susan begins writing a short novel called Susan the Jerk using her pen name Gert Fram. When Susan's father later goes to her room to talk to her, she lets him read Susan the Jerk. Realizing how badly she feels, her father tells her how much she is loved and that she is not a ‚Äújerk‚Äù. When Susan says that she is having a hard time believing this, her father begins to cry and she realizes how much he loves her. Feeling better, she gives her novel a happier ending and goes to bed. Byron Walley In the Q&A; section of his website, Card said that he published the short story \\"Gert Fram\\" under the name Byron Walley because he had a non-fiction article ‚ÄúFamily Art‚Äù, a poem ‚ÄúLooking West‚Äù and a short play \\"The Rag Mission\\" (published under the name Brian Green) appearing in the same issue of Ensign magazine.Pseudonyms \\"Orson Scott Card's website The Hatrack\\". He used the pseudonym to avoid appearing overrepresented in the single issue of the periodical. Card used the pseudonym again while editing Dragons of Darkness, an anthology. He wanted to include two of his short stories: \\"A Plague of Butterflies\\" and \\"Middle Woman\\". Both stories appeared in the book, but \\"Middle Woman\\" was under the Walley pen name. Origins of Gert Fram In his short story collection Maps in a Mirror, Card said that Gert Fram was the childhood pen name of his sister-in-law, Nancy Allen Black, and that while the idea for the story was his own, the character Gert Fram and all the \\"novels\\" she wrote (except Susan the Jerk) were created by his sister-in-law as a child. Relationship to Gert Fram by Nancy Allen Black Card wrote that, although his short story \\"Gert Fram\\" was based on his sister-in-law Nancy Allen Black, her young adult book Gert Fram - A Kid's Book for Grown-ups (1991) is not based on his short story but on her own childhood experiences.Nancy Allen Black \\"Orson Scott Card's website The Hatrack\\".

Background In 1992, Jagger commented: Reception Music reviewer Bill Janovitz writes, \\"‚ÄòI Just Want to See His Face‚Äô has the band exploring the music of America, specifically the country, blues, folk, and soul of the South... [it] sounds ancient and from another planet; a swampy, stompy gospel song that was recorded to intentionally sound as if it is a field recording document of a long-ago church basement revival meeting.\\" The song's bluesy, murky atmosphere has drawn admiration from other artists. Singer/songwriter Tom Waits names it as one of his favorite recordings: \\"That song had a big impact on me, particularly learning how to sing in that high falsetto, the way Jagger does. When he sings like a girl, I go crazy,\\" Waits says. \\"This is just a tree of life. This record is the watering hole.\\" Covered by Phish, Blind Boys of Alabama, and the Black Crowes. Recording The gospel elements to some songs on Exile have been attributed to the presence of Billy Preston during the final recording sessions in Los Angeles. Preston would take Jagger to Sunday services. Initial recording took place in 1970 at Olympic Studios, with overdubs added in early 1972 at Sunset Sound Studios. With Jagger on lead vocals and electric piano, Mick Taylor plays electric bass and Bill Plummer contributes upright bass.Some sources state the electric piano was played by Bobby Whitlock but this is unverified. Charlie Watts performs drums with producer Jimmy Miller providing percussion. Clydie King, Venetta Fields, Jerry Kirkland perform the backing vocals for the track. Bobby Whitlock claims he played the electric piano on the track in a Facebook post dated July 14, 2019.

He was the first to ride the Alpe d'Huez in the yellow jersey of leadership in the Tour de FranceL'√âquipe, 13 July 2003 and probably the only rider to have wept in distress at accidentally leading the race. Professional career Andrea Carrea was born in Gavi Ligure, Italy, and was a professional from 1948 to 1958. For much of that time he rode as a domestique for Fausto Coppi, of whom he was in awe. \\"He was a gregario par excellence,\\" said the journalist Jean-Luc Gatellier, \\"the incarnation of personal disinterest... showing to perfection the notion of personal sacrifice. He refused the slightest bit of personal glory.\\" Carrea had the face of a \\"wicked fairy and [a] Cyranesque nose,\\" said the broadcaster and historian Jean-Paul Ollivier.Ollivier, Jean-Paul (1990), trad and ed Yates, R., The True Story of Fausto Coppi, Bromley, London Carrea was riding for Coppi in the Tour de France of 1952 when a group rode clear of the main field on the way to Lausanne. Carrea went with it to protect his leader's interests. He said: Carrea had no idea until he crossed the line that he had become the race leader. When officials told him, he looked bewildered, then distressed, and burst into tears. He had to be dragged to the rostrum. He had oustaged Coppi and he dreaded the consequences.Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France He wept as he received his jersey, looking constantly down the road for the main field that included his leader. Jean-Paul Ollivier said: > He did not understand and cried when he put on the livery. He thought the > sky had fallen in. How would Fausto take it? When the champion arrived a few > minutes later, Carrea went towards him in tears to offer his excuses. You > must understand that I did not want this jersey, Fausto. I have no right to > it. A poor man like me, the yellow jersey? Coppi knew before he finished that Carrea had taken the jersey. He crossed the line while he was on the rostrum. He said: \\"I wondered how Carrea, so shy and so emotional, was going to take it. When I went to congratulate him on the track at Lausanne, he didn't know what face he ought to adopt.\\" Carrea feared that Coppi's smile was for public consumption, that his wrath would come when they reached their hotel. Still not knowing what to say, he cried like a child, said Gatellier, and poured out excuses. Coppi, touched by his tears, comforted him. Carrea was pleased to lose the jersey the following day, a day he started by posing for photographers in his yellow jersey while symbolically polishing his leader's shoes. Coppi, who called Carrea \\"the good and wise Sandrino\\", said: > Ours is certainly a very hard profession with terrible demands and painful > sacrifices. Carrea gave everything to me. In return I offered him only > money. I know very well that if he was not my team-mate he would earn much > less, and when all is said and done he is happy and many of his comrades > envy him, but I personally think he deserves more than he has the right to: > a little of intoxication of triumph. I had a way of settling the debt: it > was to let him wear the jersey for a few days. Do you know what he said to > the journalists the next evening after he had taken the jersey? That it was > not right for a soldier to leave his captain. Carrea wore the jersey for just one day. Jean Robic attacked on Alpe d'Huez, which the Tour was riding for the first time, and Coppi countered and with it took the lead. But that still let Carrea, way down the field, to be the first in the Tour's history to ride the Alpe in the maillot jaune. Carrea also won a stage in the Tour de Romandie. For years after retiring, he rode up Alpe d'Huez ahead of the Tour de France, recognised only rarely by spectators. It was, he said: At the time of his death, Carrea lived at Cassano Spinola, close to Coppi's former home.

Barbicane stages a demonstration using a puny cannon and demolishes Nicholl's material (and a portion of the countryside). President Ulysses S. Grant requests that Barbicane cease development of his invention after several nervous countries warn that continuing work on Power X could be considered an act of war. Barbicane agrees, but when he discovers that pieces of Nicholl's metal retrieved from the demonstration have somehow been converted into an extremely strong yet lightweight ceramic, he cannot resist the chance to construct a spaceship to travel to the Moon. He recruits Nicholl to help build the ship. Meanwhile, Nicholl's daughter Virginia and Barbicane's assistant Ben Sharpe are attracted to each other. After completing the spaceship, Barbicane, Nicholl, and Sharpe board it and, amid much fanfare, take off. Once they are in outer space, the strongly religious Nicholl reveals that he has sabotaged the vessel, believing that Barbicane has flouted God's laws. When it is discovered that Virginia has stowed away, Nicholl cooperates with Barbicane in a desperate attempt to save her. Sharpe is knocked out, and he and Virginia are placed in the safest compartment of the ship. Barbicane and Nicholl then fire rockets that send the young couple on their way back to Earth, while the two scientists land on the Moon in another section, with no way off. They are able to signal to the young couple that they have reached the Moon safely. Cast Production Blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was brought in to give the script \\"a quick polish\\". Location shooting for From the Earth to the Moon took place in Mexico. Various electronic sound effects in the film score were reused from MGM's soundtrack for Forbidden Planet (1956), composed by Louis and Bebe Barron.

Buerger's disease is named for him.  Family and education  In 1880 his family emigrated to the United States, and he attended several elementary schools in New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia. At a New York City college from 1897, he obtained a (B.A.), then a general (M.A. 1901), followed by medical studies at the (College of Physicians and Surgeons (M.D. 1901). He graduated from Columbia University in New York. He was married twice; his first wife was Germaine Schnitzer, a French pianist trained in Vienna. They had two children before they divorced in 1927.Joseph Cowan, \\"Mrs. Buerger Cites Other Loves of Noted Surgeon\\" Daily News (December 20, 1927): 337. via Newspapers.com  Career  Initially, Buerger practiced at the Lenox Hill Hospital (1901-1904), then the Mount Sinai Hospital (1904‚Äì05), then as a volunteer in the surgical clinic at Wroc≈Çaw with study visits to Vienna and Paris. From 1907 to 1920, Buerger worked as a pathologist and surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital. Then in 1908 he gave the first accurate pathological description of thromboangiitis obliterans or Buerger's disease, a disease of the circulatory system associated with smoking first reported by Felix von Winiwarter in 1879. Later, as a surgeon, he practiced at several other clinics in New York: Beth David Hospital, Bronx Hospital, and Wyckoff Heights Hospital, Brooklyn. In 1917 he received a professorship at the Medical Urology Outpatient Clinic New York, which he held until 1930. He then took up a similar position of the College of Medical Evangelists, Los Angeles (California), but worked there for only a short time before returning to New York to work in private practice.

Its population was 2,919 according to the 2011 census. History Banwell Camp, east of the village, is a univallate hillfort which has yielded flint implements from the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age. It was also occupied in the Iron Age. In the late 1950s it was excavated by J.W. Hunt of the Banwell Society of Archaeology. It is surrounded by a high bank and ditch. The remains of a Romano-British villa were discovered in 1968. It included a courtyard, wall and bath house close to the River Banwell. Artefacts from the site suggest it fell into disuse in the 4th century. Earthworks from farm buildings, south of Gout House Farm, occupied from the 11th to 14th centuries where archaeological remains suggest the site was first occupied in the Romano-British period. The raised area which was occupied by the Bower House was surrounded by a water filled ditch, part of which has since been incorporated into a rhyne. The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. Banwell Abbey was built as a bishops residence in the 14th and 15th century on the site of a monastic foundation. It was renovated in 1870 by Hans Price, and is now a Grade II* listed building. Nearby is a small building presented to the village by Miss Elizabeth Fazakerly, who lived at The Abbey in 1887 to house a small fire-engine. It served as the fire station until the 1960s and now houses a small museum of memorabilia related to the fire station. \\"Beard's Stone\\" in Cave's Wood dates from 1842. It marks the reburial site of an ancient human skeleton found in a cave near Bishop's Cottage. William Beard, an amateur archaeologist who had found the bones, had them reinterred and marked the site with the stone with a poetic inscription. Banwell Castle is a Victorian castle built in 1847 by John Dyer Sympson, a solicitor from London. Originally built as his home, it is now a hotel and restaurant and is a Grade II* listed building. Of the two historical village pumps standing in the village, one of them was erected to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.http://www.villagepumps.org.uk/banwell.htm Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 the parish was part of the Axbridge Rural District. The village falls in the 'Banwell and Winscombe' electoral ward. This ward starts at its most northerly point in St. Georges visits Banwell and Winscombe before ending at Loxton at its most southerly point. The total population of the ward taken from the 2011 census was 11,036. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Weston-super-Mare constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament, prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography Banwell is located east of Weston-super-Mare on the A371 road and is where the western end of the A368 road begins. The village is at the west end of the northern side of the Mendip hills. The village is located between the M5 motorway and the A38, and is used by traffic travelling from the motorway to Bristol Airport. This traffic, together with other users of the A371 and A368, often causes the narrow streets of Banwell to become jammed. There has been a campaign to bypass Banwell for many years, but other villages in the area have objected as increasing the traffic capacity on the roads would create problem on their roads. The Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study in 2006 recommended that a road be built from Junction 21 of the M5 directly to Bristol Airport, bypassing Banwell and all the other local villages, thus alleviating their concerns. However, this would not benefit local traffic passing through Banwell to and from Weston-super-Mare, Wells and Bath, so some traffic problems would still exist. Banwell Caves is a geological and biological Site of Special Scientific Interest at the western end of Banwell Hill. =Climate= Along with the rest of South West England, Banwell has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England. However, convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west. Religious sites St Andrew's Church The mainly 15th-century parish church of St Andrew is a Grade I listed building. The body of the church has a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles and a rather short chancel, considering the proportions of the rest of the church. The font dates from the 12th century and there is a carved stone pulpit from the 15th century and a carved rood screen built and set up in 1552, which escaped the Reformation. The 100 ft (30 m) high tower that contains ten bells dates from the 18th to 20th century and the clock is dated 1884. Bells dating from 1734 and 1742 were made by Thomas Bilbie, of the Bilbie family.

The hostages were freed at the request of the envoys of the Danish king Valdemar II who had taken control over Northern Estonia. They asked that the hostages be turned over to them, as part of Estonia already belonged to the king of Denmark since it was promised by the bishops of Livonia.

The week ends with the Old Town Carnival procession, which contains 'floats', dancers, majorettes and marching bands and ends with a firework display in the evening. The carnival was first started in 1969 after Old Town residents felt the original Hastings Carnival should have included the Old Town in its route and decided to set up their own carnival. The Old Town event gradually got more popular and bigger, whilst the Hastings event became less popular and eventually stopped. As a parting gift the Old Town organisers were allowed to title the Carnival Queen \\"Miss Hastings\\". In 2018, the Carnival Court was rebranded the Sea Court and expanded to include a King, who carries the title Mr Hastings.  Events  One of many activities during the Carnival Week The Seaboot Race is a race in which each entrant has to run from the start/finish line around a lobster pot and back, wearing seaboots and a top hat. The Bike Race is another race where the entrant has to ride up the steepest road in the Old Town, using a Butchers Bike in the quickest time possible, without taking their buttocks off the saddle.

Goodhue - named after Goodhue County, Minnesota - was initially laid down as Sea Wren on 7 January 1944 by Western Pipe & Steel of San Francisco, California. She was launched under Maritime Commission contract on 31 May, transferred to the Navy and commissioned on 11 November 1944, Captain L. D. Sharp, Jr., in command. Operational history Goodhue underwent shakedown training off San Pedro and took part in amphibious training exercises 8‚Äì21 December off San Diego, preparing for her part in the massive landings still to come in the Pacific War. The ship loaded vehicles at San Diego and sailed 4 January 1945 for Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands, where she arrived 21 January. There the vessel loaded passengers and cargo and sailed for Hollandia, New Guinea, anchoring 4 February. After steaming to Leyte Gulf 4‚Äì12 February, Goodhue carried supplies to various bases in the area and took part in amphibious training until 25 February. She then began to load troops and supplies for the Okinawa invasion, as American forces neared the last stop in their victorious sweep across the Pacific. More landing drills followed, after which the transport got underway in convoy for Okinawa 21 March. Arriving off Kerama Retto 26 March, Goodhue and the other transports put ashore troops to secure the island group as a base for the coming invasion of nearby Okinawa. =Battle damaged at Kerama Retto= Goodhue remained at Kerama Retto during the initial landings 1 April and while returning to sea the evening of 2 April underwent a heavy air attack. As gunners from Goodhue, screen ships, and other transports fired furiously, suicide planes attempted to crash the loaded ships. took a kamikaze hit on her bridge and was also crashed. Goodhue's gunners splashed a plane on the starboard quarter, but another headed directly for her from dead ahead. Unable to bring her full firepower to bear in that direction, Goodhue could not divert the attacker, which hit the mainmast and fell astern of the ship. Exploding bombs from the aircraft caused many casualties and fires, killing 27 and wounding 117, but the ship did not suffer serious structural damage and was able to continue. Subsequently, Goodhue was based at Kerama Retto repairing battle damage. =Okinawa= Goodhue rejoined her transport squadron 10 April. She transferred her Army Medical Detachment to Ie Shima by April and landed the main body of her embarked troops 20 April. Nearing the beaches in a predawn operation, she landed her reinforcements and retired, undergoing air attack again that afternoon. Cargo was off loaded under cover of smokescreens by 24 April and 2 days later Goodhue joined a convoy bound for Ulithi. The transport arrived Ulithi 30 April after a grueling month at Okinawa, and departed 22 May for San Francisco. There she loaded additional troops for the Pacific fighting and sailed again 25 June. Steaming by way of Eniwetok and Ulithi, Goodhue arrived Manila 21 July and disembarked troops. She then sailed for Lingayen Gulf, loading troops, and engaged in training operations 7‚Äì13 August. Word of the Japanese surrender arrived 15 August as another assault was about to take place. =After hostilities= Goodhue's next assignment was to carry occupation troops to Japan, and she loaded soldiers at Subic Bay and Cebu, Philippine Islands. The convoy arrived Sagami Bay, Japan, 8 September. Unloading her troops, the transport brought on board nearly 1,000 liberated prisoners of war - British, Dutch, and Norwegian as well as American. She sailed for Manila 12 September and disembarked the men 6 days later. =Operation Magic Carpet= From there Goodhue visited Cebu and Subic Bay to load veterans on Operation Magic Carpet, the giant task of transporting the veteran soldiers and sailors back to the United States. Sailing 11 October, the ship arrived San Pedro, California, via Pearl Harbor 3 November 1945. She made one more voyage to the Pacific bringing back veterans of the fighting in the Philippines, and sailed from San Francisco 2 February 1946 for Hampton Roads, Virginia, via the Panama Canal. Goodhue arrived 19 February and was decommissioned on 5 April. Goodhue received one battle star for World War II service. Commercial service Goodhue was turned over to the Maritime Commission who sold her to the Matson Navigation Company on 15 April 1947. The vessel was renamed Hawaiian Citizen and put into service transporting cargo and 12 passengers between California and Hawaii. In August 1959 the vessel was converted into a container ship. The passenger accommodations were removed and net tonnage increased. Hawaiian Citizen thus re-entered service in April 1960 as the first all-containerized vessel operating from the West Coast. Hawaiian Citizen was operated by the Oceanic Steamship Company from 8 March 1971 until being returned to service with Matson on 9 January 1976.

It was released as the B-side of the single In the Darkness, and later featured on the album Writer of Songs. The song was inspired by an event in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In 1971 Sergeant Michael Willetts of 3 PARA cleared a room in Springfield Road RUC Police Station of civilians because a bomb with a short burning fuse had been planted by the Provisional IRA. After the room had been cleared, an Inspector who helped local people flee then slammed the door to the room which contained the bomb, but realizing the door was not strong enough to absorb the blast, he pressed his body against the door, shielding the people on the other side. The charge exploded, and he was seriously injured. Sgt Willetts whose post was actually down a hall heard the screams, instead of saving himself he choose to run toward the bomb after shouting orders to another soldier to evacuate upstairs. He was left with a man and woman with their two children. He pushed them into a corner and stood between them and the bomb. A chunk of metal from a locker was blasted into the back of his head and he died on the operating table two hours later. As his and other bodies were carried out Irish Republican supporters clapped, jeered and sang rebel songs to the disbelief of other soldiers and police.Michael Willetts Harvey Andrews was so struck by the incident that he wrote the song to highlight the senselessness of violence and to make the point that soldiers, too, are human, and that Sgt Willetts had laid down his life for people who considered British soldiers to be nothing more than \\"murderers\\". (The incident of the soldier embracing the bomb was poetic licence.) Broadcasts of Andrews' record were banned for some time by the BBC lest feelings be exacerbated in the nationalist community of Northern Ireland, or the British public be incited to attack innocent Irish people. The Ministry of Defence advised British soldiers not to sing the song in pubs where it may incite strong emotive behaviour. Some have interpreted this as a ban. Harvey Andrews' authorship is not always widely known, and many incorrect stories about the song's origin circulate. Harvey Andrews intended the song to transcend sectarianism, but some have wrongly interpreted it as the glorification of military heroism. The song's merits were debated in Folk Review. It was criticised by Leon Rosselson for \\"catastrophic naivety\\", and Dick Gaughan compared it unfavourably to Andrews's song Hey Sandy. Sales of the record In the Darkness / Soldier could not keep up with demand in Northern Ireland. A record shop on Shankhill Road in Belfast broadcast the song by loudspeaker, and subsequently sold 5000 copies. Harvey Andrews has voiced some regrets over the song's legacy for the Troubles: References * Brummie heroes.

Weeks later, another body appears in similar condition at another location. This time the body is a female psychology doctor who was working in a state facility for psychotic criminals. One similarity of the mutilations is obvious. The eyes were targeted. The case goes to LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, assisted by Dr. Alex Delaware, an old friend and psychological consultant. The two find out that similar eye mutilations were infamously performed in the case of a family mass murder some years ago, and the culprit is now in the same facility where the female doctor worked. The media had described him simply as a 'monster' following his arrest. Facing him, Milo and Alex find the 'monster' in a deteriorated condition locked within a highly secured cell.

The self-proclaimed 'GuitaRPG' combines RPG-style gameplay with a Guitar Hero-style input system. The player character explores a musically themed world fighting enemies using an enchanted guitar. The demo version that was released consisted of a Victorian- styled level featuring enemies loosely themed around classical music. Basic enemies consisted of monsters playing harps, flutes and violins, as well as a hidden mid-boss that rewarded the player with a new guitar after its defeat. The final battle in the demo takes place in a church, against a monster called Morgan, who battles you using a corrupted church organ. Ragnarawk was developed by Voodoo Boogy, a team of 5 students from Abertay University, 2 from the Computer Games Technology course, and 3 from Computer Arts. In the 2007 Dare to be Digital competition, the game was judged to have the most commercial potential, as well as winning the Audience Award. Ragnarawk was singled out as 'one to watch' by the 2007 British Academy Video Games Awards, and also won the Interactive category at the Scottish Students on Screen awards held in Glasgow on 14 March 2008.

He was the last British- appointed and the first Indian Governor of the province of Assam. Early life Hydari was born to Amina and Sir Akbar Hydari, a Sulaimani Bohra Muslim family, on 12 October 1894. He was one of seven children. The lawyer and eminent Congressman Badruddin Tyabji was his granduncle. He completed his studies in Bombay and Oxford and entered the Indian civil service in 1919 beginning his career in the Madras Presidency. Career In June 1924, Hydari was appointed the undersecretary in the Department of Education, Health and Lands of the imperial government. He then served as Agent to the Governor of Ceylon from October 1887 to June 1929 dealing with welfare and rights of the large Indian labour force in the plantations. After the creation of Imperial Council of Agricultural Research in 1929, he became its secretary. Hydari, in the position of joint secretary to the delegation from the Indian States first and later as Adviser to the delegation from Hyderabad State led by his father, visited London for the Round Table Conferences. Speaking at the second Conference on the State's behalf, he called for \\"work[ing] in harmony ... for the Greater and United India\\". On the discussions that followed the second Conference, he was a member of the Federal Finance Committee and the Consultative Committee. Subsequently, Hydari returned to the Department of Education, Health and Lands as its joint secretary and then served as secretary of the Labour Department. During the early stages of World War II, he represented India on the Eastern Group Supply Council, a body set up to co- ordinate the build-up of supplies in the British colonies and dominions east of Suez. He was then placed on special duty in the Foreign Affairs Department. In 1945, he was appointed a member of the Viceroy's Executive Council and was given the charge of Information and Broadcasting Department. Upon the formation of an interim government in 1946, Hydari was given the charge of labour, works, mines, power, information and arts, and health. In January 1947, his appointment as the Governor of Assam and was approved by King George VI, and was to take office in May after the completion of Sir Andrew Gourlay Clow's term. He took office on 4 May and he continued to hold the post following independence. With the Naga movement on during the time, in its demand for an independent State, Hydari signed a nine-point agreement with Naga National Convention in June. Personal life Hydari married Sigrid Westling, a Swedish woman, and they had three children together: son and namesake Akbar Hydari III (1919‚Äì1998) and two daughters. His son Hydari served as the Chairman of Western India Match Company (WIMCO) Ltd. from 1964 till the 1980s, later, the Director of Facit Asia and Honorary Swedish Consul in Madras. Hydari died from stroke at 6:30 p.m. (IST) on 28 December 1948 in a dak bungalow in Waikhong, a village away from Imphal in the princely state of Manipur. Serving as the Governor of Assam during the time, he was on a tour of Manipur with his wife and son; N. K. Rustomjee, the tribal adviser to the Governor; and Military Secretary Major Dhamija. Starting 3 p.m. (IST) on 29 December, his body, in a coffin draped in the National and Governor's flag, was carried in a procession led by a contingent of Assam Rifles to the cemetery in the Imphal Cantonment and was buried at 4 p.m. (IST). The cemetery is housed in the Kangla Palace. A three-day mourning was observed in Manipur.

With more than 600 employees in 35 worldwide locations, it is also the second largest independently owned PR firm in the United States. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., APCO was founded in 1984 by Margery Kraus, who is now the firm's Executive Chairman. Most public relations firms focus on corporate communications, but APCO is usually hired to handle sensitive political and crisis management issues. Many APCO executives are former prominent government officials, politicians and ambassadors. APCO's clientele consists of multi-national corporations, governments, politicians, associations and nonprofit organizations. History Margery Kraus founded APCO Associates in 1984 as a subsidiary to Arnold & Porter, one of Washington's largest law firms, and from where APCO's name is derived. Grey Global Group, a New York-based global advertising and marketing agency, purchased majority ownership of APCO in 1991 from Arnold & Porter. On September 28, 2004, APCO announced its independent buyout from Grey Global and has thus become one of the largest privately owned public relations firms in the world. The firm has been described by Public Relations media outlet Everything-PR as \\"one of the world's most powerful PR firms.\\" In 2016, Kraus stepped down from her role as CEO, for the role to be filled by Brad Staples, who is a member of the London office. When speaking to PR Week, Staples indicated that APCO was looking to create a 'global account leadership initiative', whereby global accounts were being run by senior members of the team based in Europe, rather than the USA. In February 2020, APCO Worldwide announced an agreement to a partnership with Erie Street, a Chicago-based advisory firm. APCO declined to disclose financial terms but has confirmed that the partnership will not affect ownership or staffic at either firm. Notable work APCO handled the crisis for Merck & Co's withdrawal of Vioxx from the market. Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev hired APCO to extricate himself from a four-year-long dispute with his former son-in-law Rakhat Aliyev. WorldCom hired APCO Worldwide to handle its political PR surrounding the media frenzy regarding its disclosure that ¬£2.4bn in expenses had been falsely reported in its financial results in 2002. APCO stepped into prominence in India when it won the contract to promote and rebrand the Gujarat Global Investors' Summit, the showpiece investment meeting of the then chief minister and current prime minister, Narendra Modi as \\"Vibrant Gujarat\\". APCO Worldwide is the lead management agency for the American Pavilion at the Astana Expo 2017. The USA Pavilion was by all measures a success and had received nearly a half million visitors. The US Kazakhstan Business Association recognized Margery Kraus for taking on the pavilion management for Astana EXPO 2017.  Awards  APCO's Maggie Brown received the CleanTech Alliance Chairman‚Äôs Award in 2017. Controversy =The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy= The \\"Sound Science Coalition\\" (TASSC) was created in 1993 by Phillip Morris and APCO in response to a 1992 United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report which identified secondhand smoke as a Group A human carcinogen. TASSC developed local coalitions to influence media, legislators, and the public, and recruited scientists and researchers to support Philip Morris's position. Nonetheless, TASSC described itself as \\"a not-for-profit coalition advocating the use of sound science in public policy decision making.\\" TASSC's links to the tobacco industry were minimized as part of APCO's strategy for TASSC to appear to be an independent national grassroots coalition. To conceal this relationship, TASSC broadened their focus to question other scientific topics, notable among them global warming. =Malaysia= On March 30, 2010, Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim alleged in the Malaysian parliament (the Dewan Rakyat) that the 1Malaysia concept was mirrored after \\"One Israel\\" concept and designed by Mindteams Sdn Bhd, a branch in Malaysia of APCO Worldwide. He alleged that APCO also created the One Israel concept in 1999 for then Israeli's Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Both APCO and the Barisan Nasional government stated that Anwar's allegation was untrue. Malaysian lawmakers have tabled a motion to censure Anwar for misleading the Parliament over his 1Malaysia-One Israel allegations which was passed by the Parliament on April 22, 2010. =HP controversy= In 2010, APCO was involved in the controversial recommendation to fire Mark Hurd, the CEO of Hewlett-Packard (HP). Kent Jarrell, a senior vice president, wrote a mock news story which he showed to HP's board.

The position of Megat Iskandar Shah as the second ruler of Malacca has historically been contested. Some argued that he is the same person as Parameswara, but was mistaken as a different person after Parameswara converted to Islam and changed his name, others however disagree that such a mistake could be made, and that Megat Iskandar Shah was indeed the second ruler of Malacca. He maintained a good relationship with the Ming Empire of China and paid tribute to China regularly. According to Portuguese sources he pushed for trade to move to Malacca instead of Singapura. Identity Due to discrepancies between Malay, Chinese and Portuguese sources on the early history of Malacca, there have been some differences in opinions about the early rulers of the kingdom. The Malay Annals indicates that the founder of Malacca was Iskandar Shah, while Portuguese sources give the name Parameswara, and that Iskandar Shah was his son. Chinese sources recorded the name Mekat Iskandar Shah as the son of Parameswara. Sir Richard Winstedt initially supported the existence of Megat Iskandar Shah as a separate person in 1935. However, soon after the Second World War, he re-evaluated his opinion after the accounts in the Suma Oriental by the Portuguese writer Tom√© Pires was published in 1944. George Coedes states that Iskandar Shah was simply the name of Paramesvara after he had converted to Islam. In the 2005 book Admiral Zheng He & Southeast Asia published by Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Professor Wang Gungwu, in his paper The First Three Rulers of Melaka, published in 1968, put forward evidence to support the belief that Megat Iskandar Shah was the second ruler of Malacca. The Ming annals named Parameswara as Bai-li-mi-su-la (ÊãúÈáåËø∑ËòáÂâå) and his son Mu-gan Sa-yu-ti-er-sha (ÊØçÂππÊíí‰∫éÁöÑÂÖíÊ≤ô) or Megat Iskandar Shah. Wang argued that the Parameswara had already visited China in 1411 and met the Emperor, and it is therefore unlikely that they would have mistaken him for his son who visited three years later. According to History of Ming, \\"The Prince Mugansakandi'ersha (Megat Iskandar Shah) paid tribute to the Yongle Emperor in 1414. After being informed that his father had died, the Emperor gave him gold coins and granted him his inherited title. After that Iskandar Shah paid frequent tribute to the Emperor.\\" Conversion According to Suma Oriental written by Tom√© Pires, the son of Paramicura (Parameswara), Chaquem Daraxa (Iskandar Shah), converted to Islam at the age of 72 and died when he was 80. Megat Iskandar Shah's conversion to Islam may have made it easier for him to establish a relationship with the traders of Gujarat and Bengal.

He was a Cabinet minister who held the Customs portfolio from 15 June 1982 to 21 July 1984. Biography He represented the Tauranga electorate in Parliament from 1972 to 1984, when he died, immediately after the 1984 election. Allen was replaced in the seat by Winston Peters. In August 1983 there had been controversy over claims by Allen that he had been attacked while walking through the city at night. It was reported he had diabetes, and some concluded he may have been hallucinating or was intoxicated. A detailed account of the Keith Allen affair is provided by Sir Robert Muldoon in his book \\"Number 8\\" on page 154. In it he discusses the intrigues surrounding Allen's claim that he had been assaulted, the media fracas and a leaked medical report. What Muldoon doesn't state is that Allen was finding the job of a cabinet minister stressful and wanted to resign. Muldoon would not accept his resignation, according to Barry Gustafson in his biography on Muldoon entitled \\"His Way\\". In the documentary \\"Muldoon: The Grim Face of Power\\" reference is made to these events. It is claimed that National's Senior Whip Don McKinnon met Muldoon on Keith Allen's behalf to explain that Allen wanted out of the Cabinet and wished to retire at the next election. Muldoon retorted: \\"You look after the back benchers and I'll look after the Ministers. You keep away from Keith Allen\\". Hugh Templeton wrote that Allen announced his decision to retire in March 1984, and told Templeton he had diabetes; Templeton consulted an endocrinologist friend who raised the possibility of hypoglycaemia which could explain episodes of unusual behavior, and when consulted by Allen discovered that his diabetic medication was double the upper dose limit. With help from the specialist Allen could attend cabinet meetings again in late April. But Muldoon told Templeton, deputy Jim McLay and chief whip Don McKinnon that the minister was his problem not theirs. On 19 July 1984 after caucus met for the last time after losing the snap election, Templeton called out to Allen as they left the Beehive: > See you on Monday (for the final cabinet meeting). He went home to Tauranga > to an empty house. His marriage had broken down under the strain of politics > and diabetes.

The company changed its name to Swallow Group plc, concentrating on the hotels business and incorporating the former Vaux-managed pub estate under the Swallow Inns & Restaurants brand. The Swallow Group was bought by Whitbread in January 2000. Whitbread sold the pubs to Enterprise Inns in May 2000. The Swallow brand was subsequently purchased in 2003 by London Inn Group.

It is a generalization of the Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound; compared to the Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound, it is both tighter and applicable to a wider range of problems. However, it is usually more difficult to compute. The bound was independently discovered by John Hammersley in 1950, and by Douglas Chapman and Herbert Robbins in 1951.  Statement  Let be an unknown, deterministic parameter, and let be a random variable, interpreted as a measurement of Œ∏. Suppose the probability density function of X is given by p(x; Œ∏). It is assumed that p(x; Œ∏) is well-defined and that for all values of x and Œ∏. Suppose Œ¥(X) is an unbiased estimate of an arbitrary scalar function of Œ∏, i.e., :\\\\operatorname E_\\\\theta\\\\\\\\{\\\\delta(X)\\\\\\\\} = g(\\\\theta)\\\\text{ for all }\\\\theta.\\\\, The Chapman‚ÄìRobbins bound then states that :\\\\operatorname{Var}_\\\\theta(\\\\delta(X)) \\\\ge \\\\sup_\\\\Delta \\\\frac{\\\\left[ g(\\\\theta+\\\\Delta) - g(\\\\theta) \\\\right]^2}{\\\\operatorname E_\\\\theta \\\\left[ \\\\tfrac{p(X;\\\\theta+\\\\Delta)}{p(X;\\\\theta)} - 1 \\\\right]^2}. Note that the denominator in the lower bound above is exactly the \\\\chi^2-divergence of p(\\\\cdot; \\\\theta+\\\\Delta) with respect to p(\\\\cdot; \\\\theta).  Relation to Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound  The expression inside the supremum in the Chapman‚ÄìRobbins bound converges to the Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound when , assuming the regularity conditions of the Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound hold. This implies that, when both bounds exist, the Chapman‚ÄìRobbins version is always at least as tight as the Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound; in many cases, it is substantially tighter. The Chapman‚ÄìRobbins bound also holds under much weaker regularity conditions. For example, no assumption is made regarding differentiability of the probability density function p(x; Œ∏). When p(x; Œ∏) is non-differentiable, the Fisher information is not defined, and hence the Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound does not exist.

NPS shoes are known for their Goodyear welt technology and use it in all their shoe production. This particular technique is needed to fix the Solovair sole onto \\"Soft Sole Suspension\\" boots and shoes. Shoe manufacturer R.

So in 1960 Griggs and NPS collaborated to create a boot using a Solovair sole and a Griggs upper, and the result was the now iconic Dr. Martens boot. The first pair left the NPS factory in 1960. NPS Shoes continued to make footwear under licence until the mid 1990s called 'Dr Martens made by Solovair'. They trademarked the name Solovair in 1995 and now make their own air-cushioned boot using the same lasts and leather cutters and machines used to create the first original Dr. Martens suspension soles in the UK. NPS Shoes manufacture for Gripfast, George Cox, Vegetarian Shoes, Grinders and Tredair brands amongst others. Solovair products come in a variety of styles, colours, and number of eyelets.

A native of Kobe, Hyogo, he attended Konan University as an undergraduate and University of California, Los Angeles as a graduate and received a master's degree in political science from Stanford University. During his time in the Diet he served as the head of the National Land Agency for six months in 1989-1990 and as Minister for Home Affairs for two months in 1994. Political career Ishii was elected to the House of Representatives as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party in the December 1969 general election as one of fours representatives elected by the Hy≈çgo 1st district, after unsuccessfully contesting the same district in the January 1967 general election. He served five consecutive terms as a representative of the district before losing his seat in the December 1983 general election, finishing sixth in a contest for five seats and being replaced by Kazuhito Nagae of the Democratic Socialist Party. Ishii was returned to the House of Representatives in the July 1986 general election, gaining the most votes in the Hyogo 1st district and regaining his seat from Nagae. Upon returning to the House he served three consecutive terms as one of five members for the Hyogo 1st district; he retained his seat at the July 1993 general election after leaving the Liberal Democractic Party and joining the Japan Renewal Party earlier that year. 1994 electoral reforms abolished the multi-member districts and replaced them with smaller single-member districts. In the same year the Renewal Party merged with other parties to form the New Frontier Party. Ishii won the first election in the new Hyogo 1st district at the October 1996 general election as a member of the Frontier Party. In 1998 he joined the short-lived Kokumin no Koe (\\"People's Voice\\") and Good Governance parties, which merged into the Democratic Party of Japan. Ishii retained the Hyogo 1st district seat at the June 2000 general election as a DPJ candidate. At the November 2003 general election Ishii was defeated by the LDP's Keisuke Sunada, the younger cousin of Shigetami Sunada with whom Ishii served five of his terms as representative of the old Hyogo 1st district. Despite the loss Ishii was able to retain a seat in the House as a member for the Kinki proportional representation block. At the September 2005 general election Ishii lost to the LDP's Masahito Moriyama and was also unsuccessful in gaining a PR seat. Ishii contested the July 2007 election for the House of Councillors, winning one of 48 seats in the national proportional representation block. He served one term before losing his seat in the July 2013 election.  Opposition to Soka Gakkai and the New Komeito Party  According to the Democratic Party of Japan official website, during a 15 October 2008 meeting of the House of Councillors Budget Committee meeting, Ishii accused the opposing New Komeito Party of \\"operating in the shadows\\" and that he believed that the Nichiren Buddhist organization Soka Gakkai, who founded the Komeit≈ç party in 1954, was \\"in charge of the election campaign\\" and was \\"using its facilities as part of the campaign machine\\".

Little is known about Duomozhi's background, other than that he was a nephew of Xueyantuo's greatest khan, the Zhenzhu Khan Yi'nan. In 646, during the reign of Yi'nan's son and successor, the Duomi Khan Bazhuo, Xueyantuo fell into a state of confusion due to a combination of attacks by China's Tang Dynasty, misrule by Bazhuo, and rebellions by the Huige. Bazhuo was killed in a Huige attack, and Xueyantuo forces collapsed. Some 70,000 people fled west and supported Duomozhi as the Yitewushi Khan. Under Duomozhi, they returned east to their old territory, but, with Huige having taken much of the old Xueyantuo territory, Duomozhi soon renounced the title of khan, sending an emissary to Tang to request permission to move to the area north of the Khangai Mountains. Emperor Taizong of Tang initially sent the official Cui Dunli to try to comfort Duomozhi, but at the same time was concerned that if Xueyantuo were rebuilt, it would cause problems for Tang later. Meanwhile, tribes of the Chile confederation, which had previously been Xueyantuo vassals, did not want Xueyantuo rebuilt either and reported their fear of that event to Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong therefore sent the general Li Shiji with an army toward Duomozhi's location‚Äîwith the instruction to accept Duomozhi's surrender if he wanted to surrender, and to attack if Duomozhi did not. Li soon arrived at the Khangai, and Duomozhi's assistant Tizhen (Ê¢ØÁúü) surrendered. Duomozhi fled to the south into the canyon. Li sent his subordinate Xiao Siye (Ëï≠Âó£Ê•≠) to comfort him, and he surrendered to Xiao. Not all of his subordinates were willing to surrender, however, and Li attacked them, killing and capturing many of them. In fall 646, Duomozhi was delivered to the Tang capital Chang'an. Emperor Taizong commissioned him as a general. Xueyantuo was at its end. Duomozhi himself would die before Emperor Taizong's death in 649 and was said to have been mourned with honor.This account of Duomozhi's death was according to the Tang Huiyao, vols. 95 and 96. However, there was a historical reference to an ethnic Xueyantuo general named Xue Duomo when Wu Zetian held an archery contest in 690, which might have been to Duomozhi.

The NES version was never released in North America due to licensing issues with Activision. As a result, NES players in North America only received Activision's Ghostbusters II game. A Game Boy version of New Ghostbusters II was released, titled Ghostbusters II. This version was also released in North America.  Gameplay  In the game, the player is presented with four Ghostbusters to choose from: Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, Egon Spengler, or Winston Zeddemore. The NES version features their accountant, Louis Tully, as a fifth playable character. This, along with the North American version of Ghostbusters II, were the only titles ever released that allowed players to play as Winston. While the action can be performed by oneself in the NES version, a secondary player may join the game with the ability to press B on a second controller to release a ghost-catching trap. The objective of the game is to trap all the ghosts in an area until an arrow appears which alerts the player where to travel to next. A boss appears at the end of each stage.  Version differences  New Ghostbusters II for the NES is not a port of the Game Boy version, or vice versa. The Nintendo Entertainment System version features new music, different layouts for the levels and alternate versions of cut scenes between levels and stage bosses. The Game Boy version has 5 stages.

He was British jump racing Champion Trainer three times. From starting with seven horses at his stables at Habton Grange near Malton, North Yorkshire in 1950, he became one of the most successful trainers in British racing by the time he retired in February 1996. He is the only trainer to have saddled over 1,000 winners in Britain in both flat and National Hunt racing. He was Champion trainer in the 1978/79, 1979/80 and 1980/81 seasons and amongst the horses he trained were Saucy Kit, winner of the Champion Hurdle in 1967; Alverton, winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1979, who was killed in a fall when favourite for the 1979 Grand National; and Little Owl, winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1981. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Peter Easterby's stable housed two of the leading horses in British National Hunt racing. Sea Pigeon won the Champion Hurdle in 1980 and 1981 and was also the winner of the Ebor Handicap and Chester Cup (twice) in flat racing. Night Nurse was the Champion Hurdle winner in 1976 and 1977 and became a leading steeplechaser. He finished second to his stable-companion Little Owl in the 1981 Cheltenham Gold Cup, just failing to become the first horse to complete the Champion Hurdle-Cheltenham Gold Cup double. His Timeform rating of 182 is the highest ever given to a hurdler. Easterby's five Champion Hurdle victories are a record for the race, shared with Nicky Henderson. On his retirement, Peter Easterby was succeeded as trainer at Habton Grange by his son, Tim Easterby, who trained Bollin Eric to win the St. Leger in 2002. Peter's brother, M. W. (Mick) Easterby, is still an active racehorse trainer, and his cousin Henry is the father of Irish rugby union internationals Simon and Guy Easterby. In July 2009, he was convicted of an offence under the Hunting Act 2004 after allowing his land to be used for a hare coursing event.

The majority of the African migrants haven't got European travel visas, therefore their only accessible ways northward is that of travelling through the trans-Saharan routes. These routes are often shaped on the old ones used by caravans and during transumanza through the desert and on renewed and informal local networks, bent on the new survival needs and to pitiless rules of competition and exploitation. About the 10% of the whole migratory stream uses sea routes. The major part of African migrants usually doesn't go beyond the coastal regions of the North Africa, putting their journey to an end in one of the Mediterranean coastal countries (especially in Libya and in Maghreb, where nowadays almost 2 million irregular migrants live). Just a few migrants (between 10 and 15%) tries to head towards Europe facing control and repression policies adopted by any countries against irregular migration. The unexpected migrants' stream towards North African countries, together with the European effort and help to restrain this stream coming from Sub-Saharan Africa, prompted local governments to adopt repression and forced homecoming measures. According to the lack of repatriation agreements, migrants are mainly brought to the southern areas bordering the neighbouring countries (Rosso, near the Mauritania-Senegal border; Oujda, near the Morocco-Algeria border; Tinzouatine and In Guezzam, respectively near Algeria-Mali and Algeria-Niger borders). While the European policies, which have submitted the migration check to the coastal local authorities, seem to be effective in restraining the maritime migratory stream coming from Maghreb (though indirectly increasing human rights abuses), in 2007 trans-saharan and maritime routes from Africa have spread all over both modifying primal origins and increasing distances, human and material loss of the Great Migration. New routes have developed directly from Sub-Saharan countries (Senegal, Gambia, Guinea coast) creating new entry paths and new migratory strategies (i.e. the increasing number of underages because less exposed to the risk of forced homecoming), which have partially varied the migrants' origins (fewer migrants from Sub-Sahara and more from Egypt and Morocco) but still not reducing the migratory pressure from Libya, which is still the major source of people migrating towards Italy and the main spot of departure for the European dream. For many migrants, who try to cross the various African borders and their complex security, crime or corruption systems, this is a real human odyssey, about which in many cases we lack traces and witnesses. The journey is not only very expensive (people earning less than 1 Euro per day may spend thousands of Euros for this journey), but also very hazardous as far as life is concerned. The number of human losses during journeys across the desert, the sea or during other stops is really huge. United nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, announced since the beginning of 2018, at least 50 migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean.Migrants deaths in Mediterranean reach record percentage The reasons that prompt people to undertake the journey are mainly economic, for people in search of better life conditions, but also cultural and symbolic (e.g. in Sub-Saharan Africa the journey is mainly meant as a different way of undergoing the traditional rites of passage). Through the modification of control and repression measures, the Sub-Saharan African migratory process is changing and therefore gradually tracing new maritime and overland routes, soon led by criminal organisations and networks of local go-betweens, which create new collusion between the police and the so-called passeurs within the exploitation of human beings.  Agadez - Dirkou - Sabha  This is the first migratory route, which covers the old caravan trail passing by Agadez and Dirkou (in Niger) and the Sabha oasis (in Libya), and was gone through first in the 1990s from a huge migratory stream appealed in Libya by political measures aimed at opening the borders introduced by Muammar Gaddafi in 1992. In the last years the Libyan migratory policy has been aiming at contrasting the Western embargo and at supporting the use of Southern foreign workforce in order to overcome the productive lack especially in the field of agriculture and construction. These measures have been blocked after xenophobic reactions occurred in 2000 in Tripoli and Zawiya. From then onwards, Libya, being the country with the majority of immigrants among the local countries (about 1.5 million immigrants among 5.5 million inhabitants, mainly distributed on the coastal area), aims at restraining and repressing irregular migrants. Libya and its policy have been supported (despite the continuous human rights violations) by the agreements on the control on irregular migrations signed together with the European countries (especially Italy). Following the widely reported drowning of over 200 migrants traveling from Libya to Europe in March 2009, the Libyan Interior Minister Abdelfattah Yunis al-Obeidi announced an agreement with Nigerien Interior Minister Albad√© Abouba to begin joint patrols to stem the flow of migrants through Niger into Libya. The majority of Sub-Saharan migrants who travel through Libya come by this route.Libya says most illegals to Europe travel from Niger. AFP. 2009-04-05  Agadez - Arlit - Bamako - Gao - Tamanrasset  From 2000 onwards has been traced a new much more westward oriented route, which gathers the migratory stream moving from Sub-Saharan Africa, which is mostly exposed to conflicts and crisis (such as Nigeria, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Central African Republic, Cameroon, etc.) as well as the smaller migratory stream coming from Central Asia. So, nowadays migrants rediscover and go through the old routes of Sub- Saharan caravan networks covered for centuries by nomadic people (Tuareg) from Mali, Niger and Algeria. The new joints passed through by caravans reshape the urban landscape and many cities, like Agadez and Arlit in Niger, Bamako and Gao in Mali and Tamanrasset in Algeria, are filled with migrants and other people involved in the handling and transporting illegal migrants. The Ceuta- Morocco border fence, as seen from Ceuta.From these junts migrants head especially towards Maghnia on the Moroccan border and the Spanish enclave in Ceuta and Melilla on the coast, where they continuously try to cross the barriers in defence of the cities or to reach the nearest spots on the Algerian and Tunisian coasts. Between 2000 and 2005 the migratory pressure in Morocco has increased and reached its highest point in summer-autumn 2005, when hundreds of migrants assaulted the barriers of the two Spanish enclaves (Ceuta and Melilla), causing the death of dozens of people and the injure of hundreds of people. The renewed policy of cooperation between Madrid and Rabat, launched by Government Zapatero in 2004, prompts Moroccan authorities to adopt measures to dissuade and restrain irregular migration, causing a new southward movement of the migratory routes toward the Canary Islands.  Canary Islands  The third route toward the Spanish Canary Islands, located in the offing of Mauritania, has a long history of irregular migrations, which has been increasing from 90s onwards because of the gradual closures of the way outs northwards. The new restraining measures on the Mediterranean coasts, following up the agreements between Italy and Spain, are gradually moving the migratory pressure on the maritime route between El Aai√∫n in Western Sahara and the Canary Islands. This trail lasts almost a night. As time goes by, the fishermen' ships (dugout or pateras) of the Western Sahara, which have been strengthened with more powerful engines and therefore are more and more crowded with irregular migrants, are forced to start their journey from coastal spots more and more far-away from El Aai√∫n route. On the other hand, the restrictions adopted on the Mauritanian and Moroccan coasts deter fishermen from attempting this long journey and the starting points are no longer the Western- Saharan ones, but they become southward oriented, including the coasts of Senegal, Gambia and Gulf of Guinea. The economic costs and the losses of human lives during the passage to the West and the resulting exploitation processes are due to the increase in distance and to the risks of the transfer. Migrants, helped by a compass and little information on the driving of a boat, are in charge of leading it and this behaviour considerably increases the risks of the transfer. This also leads to an increasing number of castaways on the Atlantic coasts.

Soemitro (13 January 1927 - 10 May 1998) was a prominent Indonesian General in the early years of General Suharto's New Order before suddenly falling from grace in January 1974 after the Malari incident. Early life Sumitro was born in Probolinggo, East Java on 13 January 1927. His father worked as a cashier for the Gending Sugar Factory and was also an activist with the Indonesian National Party whilst his mother was a housewife. As a child, Sumitro grew up at a Pesantren. During the Japanese Occupation of Indonesia, Sumitro joined the Defenders of the Motherland Army (PETA), an auxiliary force set up by the Japanese Imperial Army which consisted of Indonesians with the intention of assisting them should the United States invade Java. Sumitro undertook basic training in Bogor and developed a reputation as a cadet who regularly broke the rules. By 1944, Sumitro had achieved enough to have been appointed a PETA platoon commander at his hometown of Probolinggo. Military career After the Indonesian Declaration of Independence, Sumitro formed the People's Security Agency (BKR) militia in Probolinggo before becoming a platoon commander after the official formation of the Indonesian Military on 5 October 1945. By 1948, Sumitro was a Battalion Deputy Commander before being appointed military commander at the city of Malang. After Indonesia's independence had been recognized, Sumitro continued to be stationed in his home Province of East Java, which was now under the supervision of Military Territory (TT) V Brawijaya. Although he still did not have a lot of experience at this stage, Sumitro had already become quite successful. He had successfully applied a guerilla warfare strategy akin to what Orde Wingate did in Burma during the Indonesian National Revolution and he had also been successful in cleaning Sidoarjo, Mojokerto, and Pasuruan from wild militias. For the latter achievement, he was personally thanked by President Sukarno. In 1952, Sumitro attended the Army Staff and Command College (SSKAD) in Bandung. He became involved with the 17th October Incident where Colonel AH Nasution, the Army Chief of Staff stationed tanks around the Presidential Palace to ask President Sukarno to dismiss the People's Representative Council (DPR). Sumitro recalled that a regiment led by Kemal Idris went after Sumito and other East Javanese officers but failed to capture him. Escaping to East Java, Sumitro was given command over 3 battalions and told to fight for the central Government should the situation spread to the province. The situation settled down and Sumitro went back to Bandung to complete his course. After SSKAD, Sumitro continued to work his way up the ranks at TT V. In 1952, he was 2nd Assistant to the Commander of TT V, advancing to Regimental Chief of Staff in 1953 and Regimental Commander in 1955. Sumitro then returned to Bandung in 1956, becoming a lecturer at SSKAD and taking an Officers' continuers' course. In 1958, Sumitro left for the United States to attend the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning. When he returned to Indonesia, Sumitro was once again stationed in Bandung as Commander of the Infantry Weapons Center. He held the position until 1963 where he became Chairman of the Army Planning Council. In the meantime, Sumitro also took opportunities to further his military education. In 1963, Sumitro attended the ABRI Staff and Command College. He also went abroad again, studying at the F√ºhrungsakademie der Bundeswehr in Hamburg, West Germany. Sumitro's wealth of military education was recognized by his colleagues and they suggested that he try out to become a Commander. Sumitro would always reject the notion but in 1965, he accepted appointment as Commander of Regional Military Command (Kodam) IX/Mulawarman. As Commander of this Kodam, Sumitro was responsible for the security of East Kalimantan. Sumitro quickly developed a reputation as an anti-communist. He arrested officials whose organizations were affiliated with the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). The news reached Sukarno, who summoned him to Jakarta to reprimand him. Transition to the New Order and first years of the New Order In late 1965, Sumitro was transferred from East Kalimantan to Jakarta, where he became a staff member for Major General Suharto, the Commander of the Army. Suharto, who at this stage was on the path to an imminent power struggle with Sukarno, was wooing the support of Army Officers by appointing officers of different ethnicities as part of his staff. Sumitro, alongside Basuki Rahmat represented the East Javanese contingent. For his part, Sumitro stuck by Suharto and did not waver in his support. By March 1966, the political situation had grown extremely tense. Sumitro recalled a meeting held by Suharto and attended by other Army Officers. During the meeting, Suharto told those who were present that there was a need to separate Sukarno from certain ministers in his cabinet such as Minister of Foreign Affairs Subandrio. Suharto decided to use a cabinet meeting on 11 March 1966 as the occasion in which the arrests could be made and delegated the task of making the arrests to the Army Paracommando Regiment (RPKAD). For his part, Sumitro was given the task of putting the orders on paper and passing it down to the troops. On 11 March 1966 as the cabinet meeting was held and the RPKAD, masquerading as unidentified troops made their approach, Sumitro was at home. That morning, he received a call from Alamsyah Ratu Prawiranegara, a member of Suharto's personal staff. Alamsyah called on behalf of Suharto, who changed his mind about the arrests and was now ordering Sumitro to withdraw the troops. Sumitro responded that he cannot obey Suharto's orders because it was too late and the operation was already under way. A chain of events then went underway, culminating in Sukarno handing over de facto power to Suharto via Supersemar. Suharto now sought to further weaken Sukarno's power and began appointing trusted allies as Regional Commanders. In mid-1966, Sumitro returned to East Java after being appointed as Commander of Kodam VIII/Brawijaya. In this position, Sumitro was responsible for the security of East Java. A task of considerable significance when taking into account the political situation at the time and the fact that East Java was Sukarno's home province. Nevertheless, Sumitro once again proved successful, eliminating pro-Sukarno sentiments within his command in late 1966. After Suharto was appointed Acting President in 1967, Sumitro was transferred back to Jakarta. This time he became Operations Assistant to the Commander of the Army, a position that he held for two years. In 1969, Sumitro became Chief of Staff to the Minister of Defense and Security, a position which was then held by Suharto. A year later, he then became the Deputy Commander of the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order (Kopkamtib), the New Order's Secret Police organization. Commandership of Kopkamtib and fall from grace Sumitro reached what turned out to be the pinnacle of his military career in 1973 when he was appointed Commander of Kopkamtib and Deputy Commander of ABRI. As Commander of Kopkamtib, Sumitro gained enormous power and was already being dubbed as the \\"number two person\\" in charge of Indonesia after Suharto. Sumitro tried to further strengthen his position by trying to appoint a Deputy Kopkamtib Commander of his choosing. But Suharto saw through Sumitro's attention and appointed Admiral Sudomo, a close colleague, as Deputy Kopkamtib Commander. As Suharto began his second term as President, he did not have the amount of popularity that he had when he took the office from Sukarno. As 1973 wore on, there was increasing displeasure, especially within universities with corruption, the amount of foreign investment in the Indonesian economy, and the power held by Suharto's personal assistants (Aspri). At the same time, a rivalry was developing within the political elite. On one side was Sumitro, who wanted to cut down military involvement in politics and reduce it to a purely professional role. On the other side was Ali Murtopo, who wanted the military to continue being involved with politics and one of the aforementioned Aspri. Towards the end of 1973, Sumitro began to distance himself from the government. He did not take action against the criticism and dissent directed at the regime although it was well within his brief to do so. Sumitro began holding talks in university campuses and calling for a new leadership. Sumitro also encouraged more criticism of the Aspri. Sumitro's growing power was on display in late 1973 when he intervened to help pass the marriage law. At this occasion, he successfully hammered out a compromise between the Government and Muslim organizations who saw the bill as being too secular. As 1973 drew to a close, Suharto tried to mediate between Sumitro and Ali through a series of meetings but he did not succeed. For his part, Sumitro only continued to become more provocative in his actions. During the first days of January 1974, he visited Nasution and Sarwo Edhie Wibowo, two Generals who had helped Suharto gain power but has gotten disillusioned with the regime. As 1973 drew to a close, Suharto tried to mediate the two rivals through a series of meetings but he did not succeed. On 14 January 1974, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka arrived in Jakarta for a visit. Tanaka's visit provided the ideal opportunity for those who are critical of the amount of foreign investment in the Indonesian economy to protest and express their displeasure. On 15 and 16 January however, the protests turned violent and the Malari incident broke out in Jakarta leaving 11 dead, 300 injured, and 775 arrested. After Tanaka left, Sumitro took action and went after the student union of the University of Indonesia (UI). His actions proved too late as he had already been discredited, being viewed as someone who had let the protests get out of hand. Although given Ali's intelligence background, there is a theory that he had sent his agents into the crowd to incite the violence so that Sumitro could be discredited. Not long after the Malari Incident, Sumitro resigned the Commandership of Kopkamtib and followed it up two months later with his resignation as Deputy Commander of ABRI. Suharto tried to offer him the consolation of being Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, but Sumitro rejected it; preferring instead to retire from military life altogether. Post-military career Sumitro spent the next few years in early retirement, spending his time by playing golf. In 1979, he became a businessman by establish Rigunas Group and being its Commissioner. Sumitro also unofficially became a political commentator; mainly focusing on the issue of succession. [INDONESIA-L] FORUM - Pelbagai Tafs He died in Jakarta on 10 May 1998. Miscellaneous Despite his rivalry with him, Sumitro had great respect for Ali, going as far as to claim that Ali would have been a good President.

While the Baile Chuinn C√©tchathaigh, compiled in the reign of F√≠nsnechta Fledach (died 695), does not include Sechnassach or his brother Cenn F√°elad (died 675) among its High Kings, the Chronicle of Ireland, on which other Irish annals were founded, named him as a High King on his death. The omission of Sechnassach and his brother Cenn F√°elad from this king list may be deliberate as it was compiled in the reign of Cenn F√°elad's killer F√≠nsnechta Fledach.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, p. 492. Sechnassach's marital alliances suggest that he had close relations with the kingdom of Leinster. His only recorded marriage was with one Findelb ingen Chellaig, who may have been a daughter of Cellach Cualann (died 715). His daughter, B√© F√°il (died 741), was in turn married to Cellach Cualann. Two other daughters of Sechnassach, Murgal and Mumain, are known, but no sons.Irwin, \\"Sechnassach mac Blathmaic\\". Little is recorded in the annals of Sechnassach's reign except his death.

The Irish annals contain little reliable information on his life, and the surviving record shows signs of retrospective modification. The Aided Muirchertaig Meic Erca takes as its theme Muirchertach's supernatural death. History According to the genealogies, Muirchertach belonged to the U√≠ N√©ill and was the son of Muiredach, son of E√≥gan, son of Niall of the Nine Hostages; hence Muirchertach mac Muiredaig. His mother, \\"clearly legendary\\" according to Thomas Charles-Edwards, was said to be Erc, daughter of \\"Lodarn, king of Alba\\". From the matronym comes his alternative name, Muirechertach Macc Ercae. However, Mac Ercae was a common enough male first name.Charles- Edwards, \\"Muirchertach mac Muiredaig\\". The annalistic entries for Muirchertach span 50 years, from 482 to his death in 534, using various names, including Mac Ercae, so that it is more than likely that two or more people have been confused in the annals. The first mentions of Muirchertach in the Annals of Ulster, in 482 and 483, associate him, under the name Muirchertach Macc Ercae, with the defeat and killing of Ailill Molt at the battle of Ochae, somewhere in the Irish midlands.Onomasticon Goedelicum. One entry names Lugaid mac L√≥egairi as his ally there, the other names Fergus Crook-mouth, father of Diarmait mac Cerbaill.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 482 & 483. In 485, the annals mention the battle of Grainert, perhaps near Castledermot, where Coirpre mac N√©ill, \\"or Mac Ercae‚Ä¶ as other state\\", defeated the Leinster king Finnchad mac Garrchon.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 485; the duplicate entry s.a. 486 has \\"the first battle of Graineret in which Muirchertach Mac Ercae was victor\\". In 490 or 491, √ìengus mac Nad Fro√≠ch is said to have been killed at the battle of Cell Losnaid, and the second entry reports that \\"Mac Ercae was the victor\\".Annals of Ulster, s.a. 490 & 491. Muirchertach Mac Ercae is said to have won the battle of Inne M√≥r against the Leinstermen in 498.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 498, s.a. 499 has \\"A battle in which Mac Ercae was victor\\". The entries for 501 and 502 have another doublet, one naming Mac Ercae, one naming Muirchertach Mac Ercae, for the battle of Segais fought against Connacht. Many of the entries from the 480s and 490s appear to have been modified, to give Muirchertach the credit for victories won by Coirpre mac N√©ill and perhaps by Coirpre's son Eochu.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 447 ff. The obituary of Lugaid mac L√≥egairi appears in 512, and in the following year the annalist reports the beginning of the reign of Muirchertach Mac Ercae. The next report is in 520, duplicated in 523, stating that Muirchertach was among the victors at the battle of Dethna. Another battle follow in 528, again repeated some years later, in 533, with more detail.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 512, 513, 520, 523, 528, & 533. Muirchertach's death is reported in 534, with obvious supernatural overtones: \\"The drowning of Muirchertach Mac Erca i.e. Muirchertach son of Muiredach son of E√≥gan son of Niall Na√≠giallach in a vat full of wine on the hilltop of Cleitech above B√≥inn.\\"Annals of Ulster s.a. 534; for supernatural aspects see, for example, Charles-Edwards, \\"Muirchertach mac Muiredaig\\" and Byrne, p. 103. Muirchertach was said to be followed as High King by T√∫athal M√°elgarb. B√°et√°n mac Muirchertaig (died 572),[1] called also Baet√°n Br√≠ge, was a son of Muirchertach mac Muiredaig, ruled in Ailech from 566 to 572 and was included in some lists as a High King of Ireland. Domnall Ilchelgach (Domnall of the Many Deceits) (died c. 566), called Domnall mac Muirchertaig, and Domnall mac Mac Maic Ercae, said to be a High King of Ireland, was probably also a son of Muirchertach mac Muiredaig. Muirchertach's descendants in time took the name Cen√©l maic Ercae and were the dominant branch of the Cen√©l nE√≥gan by the middle of the 8th century. The 12th-century Middle Irish tale Aided Muirchertaig Meic Erca is an account of Muirchertach's supernatural death. Here Muirchertach dies in the House of Clettach, drowned in a vat of wine, burned by fire, and crushed by a falling roof beam, near Br√∫ na B√≥inne, beguiled by the illusions of the otherworldly maiden S√≠n into believing that he is being attacked by T√∫athal M√°elgarb.Byrne, pp. 100‚Äì105; Wiley. Compare the death of Diarmait mac Cerbaill; Byrne, pp. 97‚Äì99. The manner of his demise is an example of the \\"Threefold death,\\" a feature of Celtic mythology and literature.

Obligatory possession is sometimes called inalienable possession. Inalienable possession is a semantic notion, i.e., largely dependent on the way a culture structures the world, while obligatory possession is a property of morphemes.WALS Chapter 59 sect 3 In general, nouns with the property of requiring obligatory possession are notionally inalienably possessed, but the fit is rarely, if ever, perfect.

The species is widespread in the waters of the tropical Indo-West Pacific Ocean, ranging from east Africa to India, Asia, Indonesia and Australia. Adult fish tend to inhabit coastal waters over reefs down to 100 m in depth, while juveniles inhabit a variety of environments including estuaries and seagrass beds. The Indian threadfish is similar to the other two species in the genus Alectis, with a slight concavity in the profile of the head the most obvious distinguishing feature. It is a large species, growing to 165 cm and 25 kg in weight. The species is carnivorous, consuming fishes, cephalopods and crustaceans. The Indian threadfish is of minor commercial importance, and has been the subject of aquaculture in Singapore. Taxonomy and naming The Indian threadfish is one of three members of the diamond trevally genus Alectis, which itself is one of 33 genera encapsulated in the jack family, Carangidae. The Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. The species was first recognized and scientifically described by the German naturalist Eduard R√ºppell in 1830 under the name Scyris indicus, with the type specimen collected from the Red Sea. After R√ºppell's designation, a number of other naturalists unknowingly re- described the species, with the names Hynnis insanus, Caranx gallus and Hynnis momsa applied to the species by the various authors. R√ºppell's original classification was also revised; the fish was first placed in Seriolichthys, and finally in the senior genus Alectis by James Douglas Ogilby in 1913. The species' name has been given as Alectis indicus in the literature, however the genus Alectis is feminine and thus the spelling indica is the correct one.http://research.calacademy.org/redirect?url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatget.asp&tbl;=species&spid;=15347 The common name of the species, 'Indian threadfish' or 'Indian threadfin' refers to its distribution which includes Indian waters, and the characteristic elongated dorsal fins in juveniles. Other common names, such as mirror fish and diamond trevally, describe other aspects of the species' appearance. Distribution and habitat A fisherman's catch of Indian threadfishThe Indian threadfish inhabits the tropical regions of the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans, ranging from Madagascar, east Africa and the Red Sea to India, China, South East Asia, north to Japan and south to Indonesia and northern Australia. The easternmost report is that of a specimen taken off French Polynesia in the Pacific. The species is generally an inhabitant of coastal waters from depths of 20 m to 100 m, although the juveniles may be pelagic, riding ocean currents. In some years currents bring the juveniles as far south as Sydney, Australia where they inhabit of estuaries in the summer, before dying off in the cold winter. The African pompano shows a similar pattern in Australian waters. The juveniles are also known to inhabit estuaries in other regions (including South Africa) as well as seagrass beds. Adults generally inhabit areas of reef below 20 m. Description An adult Indian threadfishThe Indian threadfish has the typical body structure of a large jack, with a distinctly angular, strongly compressed body. The major identifying feature of the species is its head profile, having a slight concavity near the eyes which distinguishes it from its close relatives in the genus Alectis. The dorsal profile of the fish is more curved than the ventral profile, and the body is deepest between the origins of the soft dorsal and soft anal fins. The first section of the dorsal fin consists of 5 to 7 visible spines, with the second section having one spine and 18 or 19 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines followed by a single spine and 15 or 16 soft rays. The pectoral fin is long and curved, extending beyond the junction of the straight and curved sections of the lateral line. The body appears to be scaleless, but on closer inspection has minute, deeply embedded scales. The lateral line is strongly curved anteriorly, with a section of 6 to 11 scutes toward the tail. Juveniles have long, filamentous trailing anal and dorsal fin spines, much like those of Alectis ciliaris. The species is known to grow to 165 cm and 25 kg. The body of adults is a silvery blue-green colour above, being darkest on the head and silver below. The upper operculum has a small diffuse dark spot. The long filamentous soft dorsal and anal fins as well as the pelvic fin are a dark blue to black colour, while the others are pale green to hyaline in appearance. Juveniles have 5 to 7 broad dark vertical cross bands through their body. Ecology The Indian threadfish is a predatory fish, consuming of a wide range of fishes, small squids, jellyfish and crustaceans. As with A. ciliaris, the trailing fins of juveniles are thought to resemble jellyfish medusae, causing predators to avoid the young fish. Relatively little is known about reproduction in the species, although observations made in Indonesia show spawning occurs in pairs at daytime between ebbing and flooding tides. The spawning area in this instance was a shoal of 35‚Äì45 m, located in a deeper channel between two islands. Relationship to humans Alectis indica in an aquarium The Indian threadfish is a commercial fish of minor importance throughout its range, often forming part of artisanal fishery catches. Beach seines and hook-and-line methods are the predominant methods of capture. Archaeological evidence has shown that the species has long been a resource for humans, with prehistoric and more modern sites in the United Arab Emirates yielding the preserved remains of this species, as well as a number of other carangids. The species is commercially farmed in small numbers in Singapore using aquaculture techniques. These farmed fish generally sell for between 7 and 11 US dollars per kg, as high or higher than other jacks farmed in the country. They are also considered quality gamefish, although are not purposely targeted by anglers, and are often taken as bycatch. The IGFA all tackle world record for the species stands at 16.00 kg (35b 4oz) caught off of Gazaruto island, Mozambique in 2007. Juveniles are moderately popular aquarium fishes, but require fairly large tanks and peaceful neighbours.

It was founded as North British Trust Hotels Ltd in December 1902 and changed its name to Crerar Hotel Group in January 2012. History The Cheshire Public House Trust Company was founded in 1902 by the fourth Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey. The first trust to be set up was British Trust Hotels. Nine businessmen invested in this company and half the shareholding was settled in trust to ensure that a percentage of the profits were indeed distributed to charitable organisations. In the early 1990s, the whole of North British's hotel bookings were from coach trip bookings, appealing to an elderly clientele. Paddy Crerar joined North British Trust Group Ltd as a trainee and worked his way up the ranks; appointed Managing Director of British Trust Hotels in October 1999 and Group Managing Director (Chief Executive) of North British Trust Group in April, 2003. Paddy acquired a shareholding in NBTG Ltd early on. This later helped him take a controlling interest in the company which became Crerar Hotels following the sale of a number of properties to Swallow Hotels in August 2005 which has been sold in 2014. In 2005, the North British operated twenty hotels, one each at Arrochar, Ballater, Callander, Craignure, Edinburgh, Fort William, Grantown-on-Spey, Gretna Green, Harrogate, Inverness, Pitlochry, Retford, Scarborough, Strathpeffer, Thurso, Ullapool, and Wick, with two each at Inveraray, Oban, and on the Isle of Skye. In 2005, North British Trust Group sold sixteen of its twenty hotels, retaining only those at Craignure (the \\"Isle of Mull\\"), Strathpeffer (the \\"Ben Wyvis\\"), and the two hotels at Inveraray (the \\"Oban Bay\\" and the \\"Loch Fyne\\"). The remainder of the business, including 1,200 employees, was sold to Swallow Hotels and Inns, a hotel chain based in Kent. North British planned to turn its attention to adventure tourism, having previously been \\"a favourite of elderly coach holidaymakers\\". At the time, some 40% of the company's custom came from coach holidays, while around 30% was from foreign travel. Substantial charitable donations are still made by the British Hotels Trust, which owns shares in the business.

Additionally, a control pod is used rather than direct tension on multiple kite control lines; only one line runs the full distance from kite to ship, with the bridle lines running from kite to control pod. Power to the pod is provided by cables embedded in the line; the same line also carries commands to the control pod from the ship.Airborne Wind Energy Systems, a review of the technologies, A. cherubini, A. Papini, R. Vertechy, M.Fontana, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2015 The kite is launched and recovered by an animated mast or arm, which grips the kite by its leading edge. The mast also inflates and deflates the kite. When not in use, mast and deflated kite fold away. A conventional ship with a SkySails system burns less fuel, and has two propulsion methods, making it a type of hybrid vehicle. SkySails' kite propulsion from upper wind power is a traction use of high altitude wind power. Up to 100 million tons of carbon emissions every year could be saved by widespread use of SkySails technology, according to the International Maritime Organization. Other companies, such as California-based KiteShip, have built similar technology.  Operational history  Maartje Theadora in port, showing a SkySails attachment arm on bow. The Wessels Shipping Company (w:de:Reederei Wessels) entered into a partnership with SkySails to pilot and test the system on their ship MV Micheal A. in 2007. They then ordered further systems, the first of which was retrofitted to the MV Theseus (see image).http://www.skysails.info/english/skysails-marine/references/wessels/ MS Beluga SkySails was the first ship to be built to use the system, and the first using a production model. The 132 m, 10,000 tonne vessel was fitted with a kite and launched 17 December 2007 and departed the northern German port of Bremerhaven to Guanta, Venezuela in January 2008. The ship completed its journey on 13 March 2008 after sailing from Germany to Venezuela, then to the United States, and ultimately arriving in Norway. While the kite was in use, the ship saved an estimated 10-15% fuel, $1,000 to $1,500 per day. The annual savings in consumption on windy routes is on the order of about 5.5%, as determined by the EU-funded Life project WINTECC (duration four years).Projekt WINTECC Layman's Report (3.1 SkySails-System) (PDF-file).

Retrieved May 27, 2011 In early 2010, the company announced that it had sold one of its 160m¬≤ systems to be installed on the Maartje Theadora, the first application of the SkySails system on a fishing trawler. The vessel is described as Germany's largest fishing ship, and the kite is expected to reduce fuel costs on the runs to fishing grounds along the African coasts or the South Pacific.  Business  The company was founded in 2001 by engineers Stephan Wrage and Thomas Meyer. In addition to the headquarters in Hamburg, a test facility was set up in Wismar. In the weak economy of 2012, a time of low investment by shipping companies, the company laid off half of its 80 employees. As of January 2016, it employs 50 people. SkySails sources its kites from North Sails New Zealand.

He is the 1956 and 1960 Olympic Champion on the still rings. Azaryan is the first gymnast to become an Olympic Champion in Rings twice, a feat that Akinori Nakayama would accomplish twelve years later and that no one else has matched since. He is the first person to do one of the rings most famous variations of the Iron Cross called the Azaryan Cross (not to be confused with the Azarian Roll to Cross), which incorporates a quarter turn to the side. Early life Azaryan was born on February 11, 1929, in Gharakilisa, Transcaucasian SFSR. His father died when he was 14. Azaryan had to leave school and work as an ironsmith to support his family. When he was 17, a group of elite Armenian gymnasts gave an exhibition in his town. Afterwards, some teenage boys (including Azaryan) went on the apparatus and tried to perform the skills they had just seen. The gymnasts were so impressed with Albert that he was invited to move to Yerevan to train with them. After three years, he became the Armenian champion on rings and earned a Master of Sport ranking. Career Azaryan in the Netherlands (1977) Azaryan competed at the USSR Championship in 1953. The judges were very strict and Azaryan felt nervous. When it was his turn, Azaryan pulled himself up on the rings and performed his own special technique. The judges did not give him an assessment at the time but he was invited to the next championship. It would later turn out that the judges had rated Azaryan's innovation as something \\"unprecedented.\\" This technique Azaryan had performed would later become known as the \\"Azaryan Cross.\\" Azaryan became a member of the Soviet national men's gymnastics team and competed with them at the 1954 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Alongside Azaryan on the team was friend and fellow Armenian Hrant Shahinyan. The Soviet team won gold in the team competition and Azaryan himself won the gold medal in rings. Azaryan joined the rest of the Soviet team at the 1955 European Men's Artistic Gymnastics Championships one year later. Azaryan became the European Champion in rings. He came behind stablemate Boris Shakhlin in most of the competitions, including coming second to Shakhlin on the high bars and individual all-around. He also had a three-way tie with Shaklin and Helmut Bantz on the parallel bars, resulting in three gold medalists. Azaryan competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in every men's gymnastics competition. He came in seventh place in the individual all-around. Both Azaryan and the Soviet team won the gold medal in the team all-around. He also came in fifth in the parallel bars and eighth in the horizontal bar. When it came time for the still rings, Azaryan won the gold medal and became the Olympic Champion in rings. Two years later came the 1958 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Azaryan and the Soviet team defended their World Championship on the team all- around and Azaryan himself defended his own World Championship on the rings, winning gold medals for both. He also won a silver medal on the horizontal bar. In his final Olympic participation, Azaryan competed at the 1960 Summer Olympics. The Soviet team was unable to retain their Olympic title in the team all-around, coming in second to the Japanese team. Azaryan, however, won the Olympic gold medal in the still rings for a second time and made history as the first Olympian to become an Olympic Champion in the rings twice. This feat has only been matched once ever since, by Akinori Nakayama twelve years later. Azaryan retired from gymnastics shortly afterward. Azaryan was the flag bearer for Armenia at the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics and is the third and fourth Olympian to bear the flag of Armenia at the Summer Olympics. He also became the first flag bearer to bear the flag of Armenia twice. Azaryan was originally intended to also bear the Armenian flag at the 2012 Summer Olympics, but the decision was substantiated due to his age. Personal life Azaryan has two daughters and one son with his wife. Neither of his daughters followed in his footsteps, but his son, Eduard Azaryan, also became an international gymnast. Albert was the coach of Eduard throughout his career. Eduard was a 1980 Olympian, where he competed in every event and won a gold medal in the men's artistic team all-around. Azaryan has received congratulations from late Armenian Prime Minister Andranik Margaryan on his 70th birthday, former Armenian President Robert Kocharian on his 75th birthday and former Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan on his 80th birthday. In honor of Azaryan, a stamp was printed of him, among other Armenian Olympic Champions, in Armenia in 2009. An artistic gymnastics tournament, the Albert Azaryan Cup, is named after Azaryan and hosted in Yerevan, Armenia. Azaryan was voted the top Armenian athlete of the 20th century by journalists from the Armenian Sport Journalists Federation.

It's a slice of life portrayal of the life of a housewife. https://mubi.com/films/jeanne- dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jan/06/features11.g21 Upon its release, critic called it the \\"first masterpiece of the feminine in the history of the cinema\\". It has become a cult classic and was the 19th-greatest film of the 20th century in a critics poll conducted by The Village Voice. Plot Jeanne Dielman examines a single mother's regimented schedule of cooking, cleaning and mothering over three days. The mother, Jeanne Dielman (whose name is only derived from the title and from a letter she reads to her son), has sex with male clients in her house daily for her and her son's subsistence. Like her other activities, Jeanne's sex work is part of the routine she performs every day by rote and is uneventful. But on the second and third day, Jeanne's routine begins to unravel subtly, as she overcooks the potatoes that she's preparing for dinner, and drops a newly washed spoon. These alterations to Jeanne's existence prepare for the climax on the third day, during which she murders a client. Cast * Delphine Seyrig as Jeanne Dielman * Jan Decorte as Sylvain Dielman * Henri Storck as the first client * Jacques Doniol-Valcroze as the second client * Yves Bical as the third client Production After establishing herself as a major film director with Je, tu, il, elle (1974), Akerman said that she \\"felt ready to make a feature with more money\\" and applied for a grant from the Belgian government for financial support, submitting a script that Jane Clarke described as portraying \\"a rigorous regimen [constructed] around food ... and routine bought sex in the afternoon\\". This script would only be the rough basis for Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles because after Akerman received the government grant of $120,000 and began production, she threw the script out and began a new film instead.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. pp. 4, 5. Akerman also explained that she was able to make a female-centric film because \\"at that point everybody was talking about women\\" and that it was \\"the right time\\". Shooting Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles took five weeks and Akerman called it \\"a love film for my mother. It gives recognition to that kind of woman\\". Akerman used an all female crew for the film, which she later said \\"didn't work that well - not because they were women but because I didn't choose them. It was enough just to be a woman to work on my film ... so the shooting was awful\\". Akerman further stated that \\"a hierarchy of images\\" that places a car accident or a kiss \\"higher in the hierarchy than washing up ... And it's not by accident, but relates to the place of woman in the social hierarchy ... Woman's work comes out of oppression and whatever comes out of oppression is more interesting. You have to be definite. You have to be\\". The film depicts the life of Jeanne Dielman in real time, which Akerman said \\"was the only way to shoot the film - to avoid cutting the action in a hundred places, to look carefully and to be respectful. The framing was meant to respect her space, her, and her gestures within it\\". The long static shots ensure that the viewer \\"always knows where I am.\\" Reception Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles premiered at the Directors Fortnight at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival and was financially successful in Europe. Writer Peter Handke and filmmaker Alain Tanner have cited it as influential on their work. It was not released in the United States until 1983. Film critic John Coleman said that \\"the film's time span covers Tuesday (stew and potatoes), Wednesday (wiener schnitzel) and heady Thursday (meat loaf and Jeanne has an orgasm and kills her client with a pair of scissors). This orgasm bit is bound to strike the serious-minded as an unfortunate bow of crass commercialism\\". Jonathan Rosenbaum defended the film and said that it \\"needs its running time, for its subject is an epic one, and the overall sweep ... trains one to recognize and respond to fluctuations and nuances. If a radical cinema is something that goes to the roots of experience, this is at the very least a film that shows where and how some of these roots are buried\\". Critic Gary Indiana said that \\"Akerman's brilliance is her ability to keep the viewer fascinated by everything normally left out of movies\\". Ivone Marguilies observed that the film was \\"fully in tune\\" with the European women's movement of the time, and that feminist critics welcomed its \\"rigorous alignment of sexual/gender politics with a formal economy‚Äîshowing cooking and hiding sex‚Äî... as an impressive alternative to well-intentioned but conventional political documentaries and features.\\" B. Ruby Rich said that \\"never before was the materiality of woman's time in the home rendered so viscerally ... She invents a new language capable of transmitting truths previously unspoken\\". Marsha Kinder called it \\"the best feature that I have ever seen made by a woman\\". Akerman was reluctant to be seen as a feminist filmmaker, stating that \\"I don't think woman's cinema exists\\". Film director Gus Van Sant named Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) an inspiration for his own similar films Gerry (2002) and Elephant (2003).

A native of Tokyo, he graduated from Rikkyo University and received a master's degree from the University of Dallas in the United States. He was elected for the first time in 2004 from his Nagasaki constituency. Early years In 1977, Senator Inuzuka graduated from Rikkyo University in Tokyo, Japan where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Business Administration. He also obtained an MBA from University of Dallas Graduate School of Management. Before entering the political sphere, Inuzuka worked for the ALC publishing company. To this day, writing remains a great passion and in June 2010, he published his first book ËÑ±‰∏ªÊ®©ÂõΩÂÆ∂„Å∏„ÅÆÊåëÊà¶ about his political experience and policy. Career Inuzuka is the president of a Japan-Hawaii based hotel & real-estate company and has also opened and operated restaurants in Tokyo. Most recently, he ran the Okushiga- Kogen Ski Resort in Nagano. Inuzuka is also a founding member of Doctor's of the World Japan Politics In 2000, Inuzuka was selected as a candidate by the Democratic Party of Japan to run for a seat in the House of Representative from the Nagasaki constituency. In 2004, he was elected to the House of Councillors (equivalent to the Senate in the United States) in the National Diet of Japan. His campaign goals were 1) to ensure that Japan ratify the International Criminal Court (ICC) 2) to advocate for those still suffering from the atomic bomb's radioactive effects 3) that Nagasaki focus on reinvesting in the local community's businesses as opposed to building wasteful infrastructure. Inuzuka argues that long run effects of inefficient construction projects are detrimental as they only solve the short term unemployment problem instead of creating a long-term sustainable solution that reinvesting in local businesses can provide. He has suggested that the government provide a \\"Nagasaki Fund\\"‚Äîa microfinance mechanism to invest in small businesses so that the local community may grow together. The unemployment rate will go down as the private sector regains its economic foothold through effective micro financing. Placing human security in the center of his policy scheme, Inuzuka aims to build a new post-cold war framework for global peace and security. Accordingly, he has thrived in his campaign for Japan's accession to the International Criminal Court or ICC. After three years of aggressive campaigning in the Diet, Inuzuka managed to become one of the leading forces behind Japan's accession to the ICC on July 17, 2007, incidentally on the World Day for International Justice, exactly nine years from the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Following his success in the ICC campaign, Inuzuka is now a strong advocate for the establishment of the proposed UN Emergency Peace Service or UNEPS, which is a permanent emergency response service designed to supplement the U.N.‚Äôs capacity to provide stability, peace, and relief in humanitarian crisis situations. Being a strong advocate for peace and stability, Inuzuka supports the central idea of UNEPS that it will be composed of willing individuals who work directly under the auspices of the Security Council and not of military troops from contributing states.

Early life Bradbury was born born at Souracre Fold near Stalybridge in Lancashire in August 1769, where he lived with his parents, sister and three elder brothers. He was fortunate to be schooled by John Taylor at a humble academy on Cocker Hill in Stalybridge. Taylor was a keen botanist and encouraged Bradbury's very evident interest and talent in this subject often taking him on botanical excursions. Indeed, Taylor recognised that Bradbury would outgrow the confines of the British Isles : \\"I venture to predict that this island will soon be too narrow for him\\" On leaving school, like many boys in the district Bradbury found work in a cotton mill. He was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1792. Time in the United States While living in Manchester he petitioned the trustees of the Liverpool Botanic Garden (now called Wavertree Botanic Gardens) to fund a visit to the United States of America to collect plants (with a provision that he would work on improving the supply of cotton from America). In the United States he met with Thomas Jefferson during 1809, who recommended that he should base his investigations in St. Louis, Missouri rather than New Orleans, Louisiana. =Pacific Fur Company= While in St. Louis, Bradbury explored the area and sent seeds back to Liverpool. In 1811 he and naturalist Thomas Nuttall joined Wilson Price Hunt and other members of the Pacific Fur Company (PFC) bound to travel the Missouri River. This group is sometimes referred to as the Astorian Expedition, named after the financier of the venture, John Jacob Astor. The main group of Astorians spent the previous winter on Nodaway Island, at the mouth of Nodaway River in Andrew County, Missouri, just north of St. Joseph. After reaching their camp, Bradbury and the expedition departed on April 21, 1811.Bradbury, John. Travels into the Interior of America, in the years 1809, 1810, and 1811. London: Smith & Galway, 1817. pp. 43-54. Ramsay Crooks led Bradbury and two French-Canadian voyageurs to the Platte River on 2 May ahead of the main expedition. While the four men reach the outskirts of a major Otoe tribe village, the inhabitants were not present, being out on a hunting sojourn. After Crooks and the others rejoined the party at an Omaha village on 11 May. There, active commercial transactions were done, with Omaha merchants offering \\"jerked buffalo meat, tallow, corn, and marrow\\" for vermilion, beads and tobacco carrots.Bradbury (1817), pp. 65-69. Bradbury noted that two Omaha men had seen him in St. Louis, at the printing office of Joseph Charless, who published the Missouri Gazette. Additionally he detailed that the Omaha village had plots of nicotiana rustica, melons, beans, squashes, corn under cultivation. The Astorians eventually departed the Omaha people and continued to follow the Missouri River. Employees of the Missouri Fur Company (MFC) under the command of Manuel Lisa were encountered on June 3. An interpreter hired by Hunt in St. Louis, Pierre Dorion, Jr. had previously worked for the MFC and still had a pending debt with the company. Lisa reminded Dorion of this and a duel between the two men was narrowly averted by Bradbury and Henry Marie Brackenridge intervening.Bradbury (1817), pp. 102-103. While among the Arikara peoples of modern North Dakota, Bradbury arranged to travel south with Lisa to St. Louis.Bradbury (1817), pp. 170-171. After arriving at St. Louis he went south to New Orleans. =New Madrid earthquake= While Bradbury was returning from the Astor Expedition to New Orleans, Louisiana he was near at Chicksaw Bluffs (future site of Memphis, Tennessee on 16 December 1811, on the Mississippi River when the first of three earthquakes known as the New Madrid earthquake occurred. His first person account is reported as the only eyewitness account of the earthquake from a person with a scientific background. He published an account of his research in Travels in the interior of America, in the years 1809, 1810, 1811 which was released in 1817. =Botanical work= Bradbury documented 40 new species of plants by sending seeds to his son. Some of Bradbury's plants were documented, without Bradbury's permission, by Frederick Traugott Pursh in Flora americae septentrionalis; or A Systematic Arrangement and Description of The Plants of North America ( http://www.botanicus.org/title/b11729004 ) (which is given various publication dates: 1813 or 1814.)

The 2.4 Litre saloon was announced on 28 September 1955.New Jaguar Car. The Times, Wednesday, 28 Sep 1955; pg. 4; Issue 53337. The 3.4 Litre saloon announced 17 months later in USA on 26 February 1957Improved Model Of Jaguar Car. The Times, Wednesday, 27 Feb 1957; pg. 7; Issue 53776 was designed for the American market and was not at first freely available on the domestic market. History In 1951 Jaguar relocated to Daimler's Browns Lane plant which provided not merely sufficient production capacity for their existing range, but enabled them to move into the middle- weight executive saloon sector, then occupied in the UK by cars such as the stately Humbers, the bulbous Standard Vanguard and the heavy Rover P4. Jaguar's new 2.4 and 3.4 introduced a modern style and a new level of performance to this respectable company. Although having a family resemblance to the larger Mark VII, the Mark I differed in many ways. It was the first Jaguar with unitary construction of body and chassis. The independent front suspension featured double wishbones, coil springs, telescopic dampers, and an anti-roll bar, all carried in a separate subframe mounted to the body by rubber bushes (with only minor revisions, this system was used on subsequent Jaguar saloons including early versions of the XJ). The live rear axle used a simplified version of the D-Type suspension, with inverted semi-elliptic springs cantilevered into the main body frame with the rear quarter section carrying the axle and acting as trailing arms. Transverse location was secured by a Panhard rod, the system being a significant improvement over other contemporary Jaguar saloons and sports cars (the reason for the unusual inverted leaf spring arrangement was the same as for the D-Type: to transfer all rear axle loads forward to the unitary body shell. The rear of the car was unstressed). The rear wheel track was some narrower than the front track and looked peculiar from behind, a feature that was blamed (probably incorrectly) for excessive understeer at low speed. It was reported to be better balanced at higher speeds - indeed, the narrower track was deemed to assist high speed straight-line stability and was a feature incorporated in many record-breaking cars of pre and post-War design. Nevertheless, it is probable that the narrower rear track was occasioned by the lack of a suitably dimensioned component from Salisbury, the axle manufacturer. 2.4 Litre with new grille introduced 1957 1957 3.4 Litre automatic The interior was of similar design to the contemporary Jaguar saloons and sports cars, with most of the dials and switches being located on the central dashboard between the driver and passenger. This arrangement reduced the differences between LHD and RHD versions. Although its profile was very different from that of previous Jaguars, the side window surrounds and opening rear \\"no draught ventilator\\" (quarterlight) windows are reminiscent of Jaguar Mark IV saloons. At launch the car had drum brakes but from the end of 1957 got the innovative (at the time) option of disc brakes on all four wheels. The car was available in standard or special equipment versions with the former lacking a tachometer, heater (available as an option), windscreen washers, fog lights and cigarette lighter. Both versions did however have leather upholstery and polished walnut trim. 3.4 Litre engine The Mark 1 was initially offered with a 2.4 Litre short-stroke version of the XK120's twin-cam six-cylinder engine, first rated at 112bhp net by the factory at the launch in 1955. From February 1957 the larger and heavier 3.4 Litre 210bhp (gross) unit already used in the Jaguar Mark VIII also became available, largely in response to pressure from US Jaguar dealers. Wire wheels became available. The 3.4 had a larger front grille for better cooling, a stronger rear axle and rear-wheel covers (spats) were cut away to accommodate the wire wheels' knock-off hubcaps. The 2.4 Litre was also given the larger grille. After 200 cars had been built and sent to USA and just prior to the car's announcement, a major factory fire destroyed 3.4 Litre production facilities.

History  The University of Perpignan in 1780 The first university of Perpignan was established in 1349 by King Peter IV of Aragon. It is one of the oldest regional universities, following the steps of more renown center, such as the far more influential University of Toulouse and University of Montpellier. Peter IV, having conquered in 1344 the town of Perpignan and reunited to his estates the Kingdom of Majorca, of which Perpignan became its capital, compensated that city for its loss of power by founding, at the request of the magistrates, 20 March 1349, the University of Perpignan, for the teaching of civil and canon law, and other arts and sciences. In the charter he praised \\"the deep learning of the professors of Perpignan\\". By the Bull of 28 November 1379, the antipope Clement VII confirmed the foundation and privileges, and the university, in a petition addressed to him in 1393, declared him its founder: \\"Pater et Genitor\\". In 1381 John I of Aragon, son of Peter IV, granted permission to the city authorities to build the university near the royal castle. The institution spread in Perpignan an atmosphere of learning, the study of law being specially developed. Theology was taught there during the first years of the fourteenth century, but it was not until 21 July 1447, that the faculty of theology was created by a Bull of Pope Nicholas V and it did not receive its statutes until 1459. The university of Perpignan was closed for two centuries between 1794 and 1971. A new University Center was established in Perpignan and in 1979 the University became autonomous financially, administratively and educationally.

Its original site was a donated (wakaf) land next to the current Masjid Kampung Sungai Manggis. The school original building is still standing. As of 2017, the school had 1049 students and 84 teaching staff. History The school was built in 1943 by Allahyarham Tuan Haji Ibrahim b Mohd Akim, the Village Head of Kampung Sungai Manggis. In 1945, the administration of the school was taken over by the Selangor State government and under the management of Selangor Islamic Council (Majlis Agama Islam Selangor). In 1959, part of the school was demolished in order to make way for the expansion of Masjid Kampung Sungai Manggis. A new building was then build opposite to the mosque. On January 4, 1960, the school was upgraded to become Special Religious Secondary School (Sekolah Agama Menengah Khas). On January 3, 1976, a new concrete building was erected and now it was named Lower Secondary Arabic School of Sungai Manggis (Sekolah Arab Menengah Rendah Sungai Manggis). On January 2, 1976, again the school's name was changed to Lower Secondary Religious School of Sungai Manggis (Sekolah Agama Menengah Rendah Sungai Manggis). In 1985 the Selangor State allocated RM1.8m to add new buildings to the school. On January 3, 1985, the project was completed and it was renamed Lower Secondary Religious School of Sungai Manggis (with hostel)(Sekolah Agama Menengah Sungai Manggis (Berasrama). On December 1, 1988, a quick relief project consisting of the erection of five classrooms was carried out wholly funded by the Selangor State government. In 1989, the school was renamed Religious High School of Sungai Manggis (Sekolah Agama Menengah Tinggi Sungai Manggis) which offered education for Form 1 to Upper Form 6. On May 14, 1991 a new block of 5 classrooms were built with the cooperation of the school and the PTA (Parent Teacher Assoc.). This project got a helping hand from the Malaysian Army (Projek Askar Turun ke Desa). On August 15, 1992, the school was renamed Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Religious High School (Sekolah Agama Menengah Tinggi Tengku Ampuan Rahimah) taking the name of the late Sultan of Selangor's Queen.

Born on 25 January 1819 in Selkirk, Lang left school at 16. In 1839, his brothers migrated to Melbourne to take up land on the Saltwater (now Maribynong) River. Lang joined them two years later as a shepherd. Leaving his brothers to run a toll bridge and then a fishing business, he returned to his brothers, eventually squatting on land near Buninyong. In 1848, the brothers acquired land in the Riverina, eventually holding 30 miles of Murrumbidgee River frontage. The town of Hay on the Murrumbidgee, was originally known as Lang's Crossing Place. Lang explored southern Queensland and in 1851, after obtaining information on the whereabouts of Ludwig Leichhardt attempted to begin a search, but was restrained by drought. In 1854, Lang married Elizabeth Jane Cape, daughter of the schoolmaster William Timothy Cape. He was elected to represent the Liverpool Plains and Gwydir in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1856. On dissolution of the Assembly in 1857, Lang and his family toured Europe, meeting Giuseppe Garibaldi at Como in 1859 and returning to Australia in 1862. In 1863, Lang became the founding president of the Riverine Association, formed to promote the interests of squatters and to advocate the separation of the Riverina from New South Wales. He was the first chairman of directors of the Commercial Bank of Australia on its establishment in 1866. Late in his life, he was involved in the Sydney International Exhibition in 1879.

As there is no road access it is a two-mile walk from Porlock Weir, and some four miles from Porlock itself. The village is situated in a sheltered spot, near the coast of Porlock Bay. The slopes behind the village rise to the height of , over which a small stream falls down to the sea. The South West Coast Path goes through the village, parts of which were closed and diverted in February 2007 following landslips in the woods. The woods around the village are home to the rare Sorbus vexans, a microspecies of self-cloning Sorbus trees which are only found in the coastal area between Culbone and Trentishoe in Devon. It is amongst the rarest trees in Britain. Other Whitebeam and Rowan species found in the area include; Sorbus subcuneata, Sorbus ‚ÄòTaxon D‚Äô and Sorbus aucuparia.  History  Culbone Stone Culbone was listed in the Domesday book as Kytenore, or Chetnore.

It lies in woodland close to the parish boundary, and features an incised wheeled cross, the style of which suggests it dates from 7th to 9th century. The stone is legally protected as a scheduled ancient monument. It has been suggested that the stone has been moved from its original site as part of the Culbone Hill Stone Row. In the 14th century Culbone's steep woods were used as a colony for French prisoners, and again in 1720 as a prison colony.Jenkins, S. (2000), England's Thousand Best Churches, Penguin Books, The woods were once the site of a major charcoal burning industry, the original burners for which were reputed to be a colony of lepers. Although the lepers were not allowed into the village, there is a small leper window in the north wall of the church. Culbone was a civil parish until 1933 when, because of the small population (43 in 1931) it was merged into the parish of Oare. Culbone Cottage, Culbone Lodge, and the Parsonage Farmhouse are all Grade II listed buildings.  Church  Culbone Church Culbone Church is said to be the smallest parish church in England. The chancel is √ó , the nave √ó and the building has a total length of . It seats about 30 and is dedicated to St Beuno. Services are still held there, despite the lack of road access. The church is probably pre-Norman in origin, with a 13th-century porch, and late 15th-century nave. It was refenestrated and reroofed around 1810 and the spirelet added in 1888. It underwent further restoration in 1928. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.  Samuel Taylor Coleridge  The Person from Porlock is believed to have disturbed Samuel Taylor Coleridge during his composition of the oriental poem Kubla Khan. Coleridge was living at Coleridge Cottage, Nether Stowey (between Bridgwater and Minehead). Coleridge later stated he wrote the poem at Brimstone Farm, though no such farm has ever existed. It is likely that this encounter took place while he was staying at either Broomstreet Farm or Ash Farm near Culbone. It is also possible that Coleridge composed the poem at the Culbone Parsonage near to Ash Farm, now a collection of holiday cottages.
